She’s seen women assigned menial tasks such as cleaning, getting lunch or organizing materials rather than learning new skills of the trade.</p><p>This treatment is not limited to old-line construction sites. Bautista, the vice-president of construction for Grid Alternatives, the US’s largest non-profit solar installer, says these problems are also common in the rapidly growing green economy – to the point that she goes to great lengths to present herself as very masculine when on a job site.
