Old Trafford was a sad place to be back then. One of the United Trinity of the 1960s had recently died, an all-time great had just left the club under a cloud made entirely of their own nasal fumes (yes, yes, we know Cristiano Ronaldo left a year ago, but never let facts get in the way of a half-@rsed historical comparison) and an under-pressure manager looked like he\u2019d happily extinguish half of the press pack with his bare hands. A club in crisis, just like today. In the next three seasons, Manchester United won three Premier League titles, a Big Cup and a Club World Cup.
