(Custom Mech Wars Review)", "description": "Custom Mech Wars is the latest game from D3 Publisher, a team best known for publishing the Earth Defense Force games. Custom Mech Wars is a mecha adventure where you assume the role of hulking robots sent on dangerous missions around the world, but that compelling initial brief leads to a game that's mediocre at best and disappointing at worst. \n\nThe game suffers from a bevy of issues including but not limited to repetitive mission design, bland writing, and poor visual presentation - which culminates in a frustrating experience. There are a few moments of greatness buried somewhere deep within this game, but those aren't nearly enough to even warrant giving this game a try.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CUKmxB0ygs", "date_published": "2023-12-13T21:00:00+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "GamingBolt", "album": "GamingBolt", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/-CUKmxB0ygs/hqdefault.jpg", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown - 15 Things You Need To Know Before You Buy", "description": "The Lost Crown will be a 2D sidescrolling game with major changes to its design structure.
