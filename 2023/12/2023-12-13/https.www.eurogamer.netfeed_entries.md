Marvel's Spider-Man 2 fans itching to return to New York for some New Game Plus action will need to wait just a little while longer; developer Insomniac Games has announced it's delaying the previously promised mode - alongside a number of other features - into "early" 2024 for some additional testing ahead of release.
</p><p>
Insomniac confirmed Marvel's Spider-Man 2 would - like its predecessor - be getting a New Game Plus mode just prior to its launch <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/insomniac-confirms-spider-man-2-getting-new-game-plus-and-mission-replay-after-launch">back in October</a>, with the developer saying it hoped to have the feature in players' hands "before end of year".
</p><p>
That, alas, will no longer be the case; Insomniac has now revealed Spider-Man 2's next major update - which will contain a numbe

If you were wondering where Fallout 4's "next-gen" update had got to, there's a bit of bad news; Bethesda has officially pushed its release out of 2023 and into next year.
</p><p>
Bethesda initially revealed it was working on a "next-gen" update for Fallout 4 back in October last year, as part of its 25th anniversary celebrations for the series. It promised Performance and Resolution mode options, enabling players to choose between high frame rates or 4K resolution gameplay, as well as miscellaneous bug fixes and "bonus" Creation Club content.
</p><p>
The update was originally planned to arrive for Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, and PC at some unspecified point this year, but Bethesda has now shunted the whole thing into 2024, saying it needs "a bit more time" to get things in order for release.

Sony's final PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium catalogue additions for 2023 have now been <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2023/12/13/playstation-plus-game-catalog-for-december-grand-theft-auto-v-stranger-of-paradise-final-fantasy-origin-metal-hellsinger-and-more/?sf270947046=1">revealed</a>, with next Tuesday, 19th December introducing the likes of Grand Theft Auto 5, Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin, and MotoGP 23.
</p><p>
That's just the start of a pleasingly diverse line-up for PlayStation Plus subscribers in December, as it turns out, with the above being joined by the likes of boisterous rhythm shooter Metal: Hellsinger and 2D Souls-like sequel Salt and Sacrifice.

December also ushers in first-person retro shooter Prodeus, Capcom's acclaimed Mega Man 11, plus a triple helpi

## Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown is a solid if unremarkable Metroidvania

It feels like Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown is still working to win back fans following the mixed reception to its initial reveal earlier this year. 
</p><p>
This is an all-new game in the Prince of Persia series with a new main character and stylised art style - something which initially seemed to rub long-term Prince players up the wrong way. But how does it actually play? Eurogamer's Ian Higton has now gone hands-on with three hours of the 2.5D Metroidvania game, and reported back below.
</p><p>
The gist? Ian reckons the game's movement and combat are fun and fluid, while its exploration and puzzles will entice you to keep on playing until you've uncovered the whole map. But - as yet - it doesn't yet rival the best of the Metroidvania genre, or the best of the Prince of Persia brand either.

Video games love spiders but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spider-senseless-the-plight-of-the-arachnophobic-video-game-player">arachnophobes obviously don't</a>, and we've seen an increasing number of studios attempting to find a comfortable middle ground - usually an adorable, blobby middle ground - for all involved in recent times. Enter developer Zeekerss, which has now taken its own delightfully literal approach to solving the ongoing spider problem in its smash-hit co-op horror Lethal Company.
</p><p>
Lethal Company - which has proven to be an unexpectedly huge success since launching into early access in October, remaining high on Steam's top-selling and most played charts - runs the gamut of horrors, pitting players against everything from ghost girls and mechanical bees to eyeless dogs and spring-loaded mannequi

One of the special things about games, and a thing that I have always struggled to articulate, is that the good ones, the really good ones, take you deep. Have you ever noticed how small a TV screen or a computer monitor actually is? Let alone the dinky grotto skylights of a Game Boy or a Vita. These screens take up such a small portion of your overall vision, unless you're crowded in really close. But when the right game comes along, the rest of the world just irises out. You don't see the border of the screen. You don't even really get a meaningful sense of its flatness anymore. A good game draws you deep inside. 
</p><p>
This is what William Gibson called cyberspace, I gather. He tried to picture the world on the other side of the scrolling PC monitor and a whole landscape was born. But it doesn't feel like cyberspace here very

Earth has a space junk problem. With each new rocket launch, or decommissioned satellite, we add more detritus to high orbit. Already satellites sometimes collide and one day, or so I've read, there'll be so much flotsam up there we'll be earthbound; unable to launch new spacecraft through a prison of shrapnel. Anyway, I'm no rocket scientist, but this does seem an apt metaphor for today's games market. Back in the day there were few enough new indies that games like Super Meat Boy, Crimzon Clover or FTL went straight to the moon. Today we're blessed with so many launches that it's hard to spot the gems among the debris.

It's looking increasingly unlikely that Starfield will have the same kind of longevity as its Bethesda stablemates, but that doesn't appear to be discouraging the studio from tinkering with the space adventure's core - and one intriguing addition Bethesda has now confirmed includes "news ways of traveling", coming at some point in 2024.
