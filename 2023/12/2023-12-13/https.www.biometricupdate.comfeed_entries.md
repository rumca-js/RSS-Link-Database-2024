		A recent marketing survey funded by a voice biometrics firm has found that a majority of respondents are concerned about the threat of deepfakes and voice clones.

The company, <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/pindrop">Pindrop</a>, held a webinar to discuss the survey. Consumers surveyed were more likely to report feeling negative about voice cloning and deepfakes, but totals are not hugely lopsided. Synthedia performed the research.

Voice deepfakes can be detected with software, but the technology is still maturing, as <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/identt">Identt</a> AI Technical Leader for Biometrics Piotr Kawa explained in another webinar to members of the <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/european-associati

		<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/worldcoin">Worldcoin</a> has expanded its digital identity system, added face biometric authentication and unveiled support for a series of popular online services.

The new World ID 2.0 was unveiled in a company <a href="https://worldcoin.org/blog/announcements/introducing-world-id-2.0">blog post</a>, along with the Worldcoin App Store and the protocol for Apps to go in it.

The upgraded digital ID includes three levels. “World ID device level” is a digital ID with a lower level of assurance, being based on verification with a mobile device.  For apps requiring higher assurance, “World ID Orb” builds in the assurance of humanity and uniqueness provided by iris biometrics scans with the company’s infamous proprietary

		The U.S. Financial Services Committee held a hearing with finance tech innovation leaders on opportunities and risks associated with AI. At least some members of the committee are clearly interested in the potential for digital IDs to fight fraud while promoting financial inclusion, and at the same time, a Mitek-sponsored survey shows higher customer satisfaction with biometrics than legacy authentication methods, and a similar appetite for stronger authentication amongst businesses.
<h2>Committee hearing addresses generative AI threat, digital ID opportunity</h2>
Attendees of the Committee hearing discussed how technology should be used to facilitate responsible financial innovation while protecting customers and complying with regulations.

		<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/dashlane">Dashlane</a> has launched passwordless login with biometrics, which a company release says can reduce phishing, boost security and make account recovery easier.

The opt-in device-bound security feature, says a company <a href="https://www.dashlane.com/blog/dashlane-launches-passwordless-login">blog post</a>, makes it the first credential manager to eliminate master passwords. Users can securely set up their Dashlane account using a device-specific PIN and biometric fingerprint or face verification. The unique vault key created during setup, which encrypts the user’s Dashlane vault, is tied locally to the device. The firm has also developed a secure method for transferring the vault decryption key between devices for cros

		<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/thales-digital-identity-and-security">Thales</a> has scored a rank-one hit rate of 91.9 percent for latent fingerprint biometrics in the last evaluation by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), according to a company announcement.

The company also says its forensic latent print identification algorithm uses over 50 percent less computing power than the algorithms submitted by competing vendors, and is more than 50 percent faster than all other submissions to NIST’s Evaluation of Latent Friction Ridge Technology (<a href="https://pages.nist.gov/elft/elft_1_x/results/">ELFT</a>).

Lower computing power in combination with higher speed means that Thales’ forensic fingerprint matching algorithm

		Delta has announced that its digital ID program is now expanding to three major airports – Los Angeles (LAX), LaGuardia (LGA), and John F. Kennedy International (JFK), the latter of which launches on December 14th. The program uses biometric face matching to eliminate the need for manual ID checks at checkpoints like bag drop and security.

The program is eligible for customers who have a TSA PreCheck membership, have a free SkyMiles membership, and have the Fly Delta app. They must also have their passport information and a Known Traveler Number stored in their Delta profile.

Eligible customers get an automatic notification in the app when traveling from an airport with the digital ID program. Once they opt in, the D

On November 30, 2023, the Illinois Supreme Court <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202312/hipaa-trumps-biometric-privacy-law-in-drug-cabinet-lawsuit">issued</a> an important opinion interpreting the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA) in <em>Mosby v.

The <em>Mosby</em> opinion is a key win for BIPA defendants—especially for health care entities and their biometric technology vendors—as the decision clarifies that BIPA’s health care exemption extends to the use of health care worker biometric info

Biometric testing is a critical step in ensuring system integrity.

It’s not always biometrics that fail but the process. Biometric technology is complex and therefore poses risks that need to be managed. By prioritising comprehensive testing, organisations can improve the integrity and reliability of biometric systems, safeguarding users from the potential consequences of misidentification or security breaches. Upfront testing serves as a cornerstone of responsible biometric implementation, fostering t
