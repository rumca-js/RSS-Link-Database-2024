At worst, they look like what they almost always are: government officials moving directly to the positions within the industry they just recently regulated, carrying [&#8230;]

Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey is currently engaged in numerous legal battles over speech which can more or less be summarized as “criticism of people Andrew Bailey likes is censorship,” but “criticism of people Andrew Bailey doesn’t like is good and just and important to the marketplace of ideas.” Andrew Bailey is a hypocrite.
