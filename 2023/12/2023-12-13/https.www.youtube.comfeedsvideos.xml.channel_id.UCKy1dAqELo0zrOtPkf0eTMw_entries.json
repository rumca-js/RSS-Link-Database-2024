And the main reason is, Rockstar wants to make sure it optimizes its games to their fullest capacity before porting it over to PC hardware. That might seem like an obvious reason, but it\u2019s actually deeper than that. Ex-Rockstar Games employee Mike York took to his YouTube channel to delve into the reasons why #RockstarGames and Take-Two handle its PC ports the way it does, and how it\u2019ll handle #GTA6. According to Mike York, Rockstar tends to focus on the PC build later on as it\u2019ll take them longer to configure and optimize. GTA 5 was released on the PS3 and Xbox 360 in 2013, then finally found its way on PC two years later in 2015. It was definitely a shorter release window for Red Dead Redemption 2, as it hit PC just a year after releasing on consoles in 2018. We also have that Florida Joker Man back at it again calling out GTA yet again. And what games could become the next Pringles Icon.
