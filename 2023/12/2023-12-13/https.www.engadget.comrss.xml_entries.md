<p>An anonymous and inventive Nintendo fan has recreated the Game Boy classic <em>The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening</em> with a twist that separates it from the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-19-legend-of-zelda-links-awakening-review.html">official 2019 remaster</a>. The widescreen Windows remake adds high frame rate support and lets you zoom out to view a larger portion — or even all — of Koholint Island. But the game may not last long as Nintendo has a habit of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-09-05-nintendo-issues-dmca-takedown-for-hundreds-of-fan-games.html">crushing copyright-infringing fan games</a>, even when crafted lovingly and offered for free like this one.</p>

<p>EU regulators have reportedly sided against Apple in its long fight against Spotify over App Store policies. The complaint centered on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/eu-music-streaming-antitrust-case-apple-focus-anti-steering-clauses-123405739.html">"anti-steering" rules</a> that allegedly prevented platforms like Spotify from adequately promoting alternative methods of payment.

<p>When Threads launched this summer, one of the more intriguing aspects of the new service was Meta’s promise to support ActivityPub, the open-source protocol that powers Mastodon and other <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/is-decentralization-the-future-of-social-media-194554192.html"><ins>decentralized social media</ins></a> platforms. But there were still many unanswered questions about how such interoperability would work, and just how committed Meta was to the plan.</p>
<p>Now, Meta is taking its first step toward making Threads compatible with the fediverse. A new test will make some Threads content available on Mastodon and other apps for the first time, Mark Zuckerberg announced in <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.threads.net/@zuck/post/C0zXcQmxO77'"><ins>a post</ins></a> on Threads. “Making Threads interoperable will give people more choice over how they interact and it will help content reach more people,” he wrote.

<p>There have never been more good options out there for true wireless earbuds. While Apple’s AirPods likely helped make the category a mainstay, other brands like Sony, Bose and Sennheiser have put a lot of work into developing small, comfortable earbuds that pack a lot of features like active noise cancelation (ANC), custom EQ and solid battery life. But that means wading through the sea of options available now is daunting, especially considering new earbuds are popping up all the time. We’ve tested and reviewed dozens of true wireless earbuds at this point and we hope this guide of our top recommendations can help you find the best wireless earbuds for your needs.</p>
<h2>What to look for</h2>
<p>When it comes to shopping for earbuds, the first thing to consider is design or wear style. Do you prefer a semi-open fit like AirPods or do you want something that completely closes off your ears? If you’re shopping for earbuds with active noise cancellation, you'll want the latter, but

We don’t blame you — between family gatherings and the final work rush before PTO kicks in, it’s hard to find the time to go to a store to pick out presents.

<p>Following a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-autopilot-investigation-nhtsa-141310451.html">two-year investigation</a> by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), Tesla will recall over two million vehicles to make fixes to its Autopilot system, according to <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/vehicle/2023/TESLA/MODEL%252520S#recalls">new NHTSA documents</a>. Fixes will be issued to owners for free via over-the-air (OTA) updates to add features that ensure drivers pay attention while using Tesla's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-21-iihs-driver-assistance-study.html">controversial</a> driver assistance system.

<p>Apple is adding a new iPhone feature called <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ios-173s-stolen-device-protection-will-make-life-harder-for-iphone-thieves-201633214.html">Stolen Device Protection</a>, which limits what thieves can do with a stolen phone and passcode. It combines location, biometric scans and time delays, allowing victims to lock out the perpetrator and safeguard their data.</p>
<p>Stolen Device Protection defends against iPhone thieves who monitor users entering their passcode before snatching the device. With the passcode, the perpetrator could reset the owner’s Apple ID password, turn off Find My tracking, change an Apple ID password and a lot more.</p>
<p>With this still-in-beta feature turned on, the phone will ask for a Face ID or Touch ID scan if the device is away from a familiar location, like home or work. It will also require a one-hour delay before changing the Apple ID password on the device. After the hour, it will still ask for a Face ID or Touch ID Sc

<p>Several years ago, Land Rover <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jaguar-will-only-make-electric-cars-starting-in-2025-121436428.html">announced plans</a> to offer electrified versions of all its vehicle and that process has finally begun. The company teased the Range Rover Electric in a <a href="https://media.landrover.com/news/2023/12/new-era-range-rover-waiting-list-range-rover-electric-now-open-prototype-testing-phase">press release</a> and video, promising an 800 volt architecture and all the benefits of a modern EV. At the same time, it'll be just as powerful and capable off-road as its gas-guzzling counterparts — even offering the ability to wade into nearly three feet of water.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apart from some aspirational promises, details are still sparse. To start with, it'll supposedly have &quot;performance comparable to a flagship Range Rover V8 and the all-terrain capability developed in-house by Land Rover experts.&quot; That all-terrain capability includes the ability t

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/one-week-in-threads-has-become-twitters-biggest-threat-140050889.html">Threads</a> is going to make an effort to moderate more of the user-generated content on the platform. Head of Instagram, Adam Mosseri, posted that it is working on creating a fact-checking program. Mosseri didn’t lay out what such a program would entail, only saying that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/threads-introduces-tags-to-help-users-categorize-posts-092650879.html">Threads</a> is going to “match fact-check ratings from Facebook or Instagram to Threads.” Currently, fact-checkers can't rate content on Threads, so instead when something gets flagged as being false on Instagram or Facebook, a fact-checker’s ratings will also roll over onto the app. “Our goal is for fact-checking partners to have the ability to review and rate misinformation on the app,” Mosseri wrote.</p>
<p>The program is expected to be available early next year. <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2023/0
