A white mayor decided to throw a Christmas party for other local elected officials. But they decide that no \"people of color\" are allowed to attend because they want to keep it as a \"white only\" party. That would be one of the most racist things you could do as an elected official. And that is exactly what the woke Mayor of Boston did. Except she thought it was justified because it was white people who were being discriminated against and not the other way around. </p><p><br /></p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\"></div> \u2014  (@)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/libsoftiktok/status/1734942085344882822\"></a>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://thepostmillennial.com/no-whites-allowed-at-boston-mayors-christmas-party-for-electeds-of-color-only\" target=\"_blank\">According to Th", "link": "https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/boston-mayor-party", "date_published": "2023-12-13T22:40:40+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "Louder With Crowder", "album": "Louder With Crowder", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yMzE1NTQ3MS9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1MjE1Njc1MH0.cVUGcJzdyyjj3xKR7tPeQKtnP3_3j0yJ-3yt3wA91m8/image.png?width=210", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "http://louderwithcrowder.com/feed/", "title": "Doctor Claimed Anti-Male Bias In Sexual Assault Allegations, A Jury Just Awarded Him a HUGE Settlement", "description": "<img src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.jpg?id=50788837&amp;width=1245&amp;height=700&amp;coordinates=0%2C270%2C0%2C270\" /><br /><br /><p>Why does it seem like the #meetoo movement did not age that well?
