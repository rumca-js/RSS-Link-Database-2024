A new study has shown why many women experience nausea and vomiting during pregnancy -- and why some women, including the Duchess of Cambridge, become so sick they need to be admitted to hospital. The culprit is a hormone produced by the fetus -- a protein known as GDF15. But how sick the mother feels depends on a combination of how much of the hormone is produced by the fetus and how much exposure the mother had to this hormone before becoming pregnant.

New research reveals that neurons in the preoptic hypothalamus -- the region of the brain that regulates sleep and body temperature -- are rhythmically activated during non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREM). Stress activates these brain cells out of turn, causing 'microarousals,' that interrupt sleep cycles and decrease the duration of sleep episodes, according to new research.

A new study expands the search for life beyond our solar system by indicating that 17 exoplanets (worlds outside our solar system) could have oceans of liquid water, an essential ingredient for life, beneath icy shells. Water from these oceans could occasionally erupt through the ice crust as geysers. The science team calculated the amount of geyser activity on these exoplanets, the first time these estimates have been made. They identified two exoplanets sufficiently close where signs of these eruptions could be observed with telescopes.
