Custom Mech Wars is the latest game from D3 Publisher, a team best known for publishing the Earth Defense Force games. Custom Mech Wars is a mecha adventure where you assume the role of hulking robots sent on dangerous missions around the world, but that compelling initial brief leads to a game that's mediocre at best and disappointing at worst. 

The game suffers from a bevy of issues including but not limited to repetitive mission design, bland writing, and poor visual presentation - which culminates in a frustrating experience. There are a few moments of greatness buried somewhere deep within this game, but those aren't nearly enough to even warrant giving this game a try.

The Lost Crown will be a 2D sidescrolling game with major changes to its design structure. Clearly, there’s no shortage of reasons to be excited about the game, and after having recently spent 3-4 hours of hands-off time with it, our excitement has only grown. 

Here’s everything that we’ve learned about the game from our hands-off preview.

Well, it's finally happened. The slow demise of E3 has reached its inevitable end. What was once the be-all and end-all of the games industry, an event that everyone and everything the medium touched flocked to, had clearly been on its last legs these last few years, and after a few floundering failed attempts to revitalize itself, it has, sadly, drawn its last breath. 

The Entertainment Software Association recently announced that the event has been officially and permanently cancelled, which means the unsuccessful attempt to get a reimagined E3 2023 off the ground was the last time we would ever hear about E3 in an official capacity.
