  <p id="n0n7sA">Instagram is going to help you spice up your Notes by letting you post video Notes, Meta announced on Wednesday.</p>
<p id="ihEr18">Notes have so far been text-based, meaning they currently function like the AIM status messages of my millennial youth. (You can even share what song you’re listening to!) The addition of video gives you a little more room to be creative with your Notes, and you can add a text caption, too. But since video Notes can only be two-second loops, they probably aren’t going to replace Instagram Stories anytime soon.</p>
<p id="UT71cJ">The company is also introducing additional ways to reply to Notes from your f

  <p id="3BHGjN">The next film from director Alex Garland looks like quite the action-packed dystopia. A24 just released the first trailer for <em>Civil War</em>, which is set in a near-future version of the US that is, as you can probably guess, in the midst of a violent civil war, with forces from Texas and California making their way to the White House. It’s hard to glean too many story details from the trailer, but it features a small group attempting to infiltrate a heavily fortified Washington, DC. It also features the tagline “all empires fall,” so you know things aren’t going so well.</p>

  <p id="lQQdgW">Tesla is pushing software updates to over 2 million vehicles in the US — or almost every Model S, Y, X, and 3 ever sold in the country — to address a defect in the company’s Autopilot system.

  <p id="GrhKYv">The <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-399068A1.pdf">FCC announced today</a> that it won’t award Elon Musk’s Starlink an $886 million subsidy from the Universal Service Fund for expanding broadband service in rural areas. The money would have come from the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund program (RDOF), but the FCC writes that Starlink wasn’t able to “demonstrate that it could deliver the promised service” and that giving the subsidy to it wouldn’t be “the best use of limited Universal Service Fund dollars.”</p>
