<p>And a very merry Christmas to you too, Luis Enrique. It was looking pretty hairy there for a while, as his Paris Saint-Germain side teetered on the brink of a group-stage humbling in the only competition that has ever really seemed to matter to them. Borussia Dortmund were ahead and so were Newcastle, and for all their vigour and enterprise the champions of France were doing their level best to push their coach towards the one door of the Paris advent calendar you really do not want to open.</p><p>Danger averted, just about, via a ghost of the present and a ghost of the future. Just as the cracker jokes were beginning to write themselves following Karim Adeyemi’s second-half goal, Kylian Mbappé and Warren Zaïre-Emery seized control of the game. Zaire-Emery’s spectacular equalising goal, created by Mbappé, was ultimately enough to scrape Paris through their group in second place, even if Milan’s late goal on Tyneside gave the closing minutes a sense of unbearable jeopardy.</p> <a h

The actor, currently starring on Showtime’s The Curse as an aspiring real estate entrepreneur-cum-lifestyle host, is of course easy to look at: huge, expressive eyes, bright smile and, in the show, hair and clothing that’s not quite derivative but not alternative, either. On The Curse, the hourlong brainchild of Benny Safdie and Nathan Fielder, Stone plays the dual role of Whitney Siegel on and off camera and, in host mode, Whitney is brittle but formidable. She understands the demands of the job: the host must project design knowledge, sunniness and perky determination (on top of being white, thin and conventionally attractive).</p><p>The Curse, like Whitney, is trying to do a lot, among them: cringe comedy, gentrification satire and surreal, genre-bending drama with commentary on ev

The country has been suffocating under the huge weight of unsustainable debt for more than three decades. Between 2012 to February 2017, when I led the first internationally recognised government since the collapse of the state in 1991, we realised quickly that we had to re-engage with all the international financial institutions and our bilateral and multilateral creditors to address this crippling impediment to our economic development.</p><p>Somalia owed more than $5bn (£3.9bn). And the interest and charges on these debts kept mounting.

It felt impolite not to say NOT AT ALL! But it’s difficult to physically communicate that, especially on a motorbike. Wi

<p><strong>Swan theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon<br /></strong>Isobel McArthur gives a giddy fresh spin to Thomas Heywood’s 16th-century romp which sends a Cornish landlady, in her repurposed bar, to sea</p><p>‘Not everything is good because it’s old,” sighs the prologue to Isobel McArthur’s debut RSC show.

On Thursday, India commence their mammoth effort with a four-day encounter against England at the DY Patil Stadium in Mumbai. After a mere three-day break, they will then take on Australia at the Wankhede. Back-to-back Tests may be common in the men’s game but in women’s cricket, where multi-day matches are rarely played, this is the sort of scheduling that makes you sweat just thinking about it.</p><p>And yet it’s also an opportunity.

<p>Documentary Immediate Family follows the unsung heroes who worked alongside Stevie Nicks, Carole King, James Taylor and others</p><p>At the start of the 70s, a new musical term came into vogue – “the singer-songwriter.” It referred to a swelling wave of stars that included James Taylor, Carole King, Joni Mitchell and Jackson Browne, all of whom, it turns out, hated the term with a passion. “I don’t know one musician who used it,” said Danny Kortchmar, a guitarist who played with all those stars. “Everyone loathed it.”</p><p>A new documentary, titled Immediate Family, helps explain why. “When you say ‘singer-songwriter’ it makes it sound like you’re talking about a solo act,” said the film’s director Denny Tedesco. “It was just the opposite of that.

<p>This work of a lifetime presents high-octane, high-politcal drama – and attempts to rehabilitate the ‘bourgeois’ provisional government that preceded the Bolsheviks</p><p>This is, by my count, Robert Service’s 12th book that touches on the Russian Revolution, either substantively or tangentially. So far, we’ve had a biographical triptych on Stalin, Trotsky and Lenin; a trilogy on the last; two broad surveys of modern Russia; a monograph on the last tsar and another on the Bolsheviks; and a general account for students. By now, he could churn out another history on autopilot. He is, thankfully, too clever for that. What we have here is the work of a lifetime, a reflective volume alert to local and geopolitics, art and culture, high society and the affairs of ordinary people. If he had served up a larger slice of history, encompassing the consolidation of Stalinism rather than ending the narrative with Lenin’s demise, he could have claimed with some justification to have written the

In 1992 my parents heard about a competition on Capital FM, sponsored by Sega. I was seven and obsessed with Sonic the Hedgehog. To enter, I had to write a story about finding Santa but my sister had just been born and my mum forgot to post the letter.
