A white mayor decided to throw a Christmas party for other local elected officials. But they decide that no "people of color" are allowed to attend because they want to keep it as a "white only" party. That would be one of the most racist things you could do as an elected official. And that is exactly what the woke Mayor of Boston did. Except she thought it was justified because it was white people who were being discriminated against and not the other way around. </p><p><br /></p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

It is because it didn't, as it was based on the most illogical statement "believe all women." As if women could never lie or something. </p><p>Anyway, the same people who scream "toxic masculinity" and "bash the patriarchy" seem to have created a trait known as "toxic femininity."  One way to describe this phenomenon is this phrase: "If you can't handle me at my worst, you don't deserve me at my best." Let's just say there is a man in this story that I am about to tell you that definitely could not handle this girl's worst. </p><p><br /></p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
