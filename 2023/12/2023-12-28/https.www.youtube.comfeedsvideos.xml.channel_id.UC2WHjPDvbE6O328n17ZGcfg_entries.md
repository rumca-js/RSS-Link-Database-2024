There's a better way to write code, and that's by having your code meet 3 high-level goals. As a programmer, every time you write code you want to be asking yourself if this code meets those 3 goals. And in doing so, it‚Äôll have you build a coder‚Äôs mindset so every time you pick up a coding task, you‚Äôre thinking like a programmer without even thinking about it.
