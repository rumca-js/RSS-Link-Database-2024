## Arsenal’s title hopes hit as old boy Mavropanos seals West Ham win

<p>This was not the reunion that Arsenal envisaged. On a night when West Ham’s discipline turned the Emirates Stadium into a pit of frustration, the narrative moved away from Declan Rice and shifted to Konstantinos Mavropanos haunting his old club with a goal that raises further questions over the hopes of winning the title.</p><p>Arsenal were desperately lacking in conviction when a win would have taken them back to the top of the league. Mikel Arteta’s side remain two points behind Liverpool and, perhaps more pertinently, only three above an apparently resurgent Manchester City.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/dec/28/arsenal-west-ham-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Club’s form has declined after brilliant start but their risky possession game was at its thrilling best against Tottenham</p><p>As Johan Cruyff pioneered the use of the sweeper keeper with Stanley Menzo at Ajax, he argued that he didn’t care if his side conceded a couple of goals a season from lobs into an empty net with his goalkeeper caught upfield; far more important were the gains made by being able to play a higher offside line, squeezing the play, in the knowledge that Menzo was there to mop up behind. It made it harder for opponents to attack, and meant that Ajax more regularly won the ball back higher up the pitch in dangerous areas.</p><p>The problem, said Cruyff, was that football culture was too obsessed with the obvious and with apportioning blame. A goalkeeper being caught out of his goal looked bad and so drew criticism, whereas the incremental gains, which outweighed the small handful of glaring losses, were ignored. It’s not just a football issue. It’s a truism in

## Tottenham battered despite late rally after Estupiñán provides Brighton fizz

<p></p><p>The strange thing was that Roberto De Zerbi, always such a livewire in his technical area, barely flinched. The Brighton manager had seen Pervis Estupiñán, on as a substitute, sculpt a masterpiece from long range to put his team 3-0 up just after the hour.</p><p>Perhaps, it was simply a reflection of De Zerbi’s comfort. Because at that point, it was easy to write that Brighton had been outstanding, Tottenham outclassed. Brighton wanted to find a spark in the Premier League, having saved most of their best stuff this season for their Europa League adventure.

<p>Drummer and percussionist who developed his own musical language as a composer</p><p>A pivotal moment in the career of the British drummer and percussionist Tony Oxley came when a successful European tour as part of a trio led by the celebrated American jazz pianist Bill Evans was followed by an invitation to remain with the group when they returned to the US. This was in 1972, and permanent membership of the trio would have enhanced the young drummer’s prestige within the jazz world. Instead, he politely declined, believing that to accept would be an unacceptable diversion from his self-imposed task of developing musical languages as a player and composer.</p><p>The evidence of his resolve could be seen that same year in the cover picture of Ichnos, an album of Oxley’s music.

<p>When we started out, we didn’t dare dream it would lead to this: expanded rainforest, a beaver release, and rewilding at Balmoral</p><p>Sid Rawle, the 1960s peace campaigner and infamous “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/sep/15/sid-rawle-obituary">King of the Hippies</a>”, once remarked that if land ownership in Britain were to be divided equally, we would each get about an acre. Surprisingly, this thought experiment would just about hold true today.</p><p>The UK measures 60m acres in total and is home to around 67 million of us. There is something rather beguiling about such extreme egalitarianism – impractical though it might be. One person, one vote, one acre. But there’s also something about it that rather helps clarify the mind should you ever find yourself, as I have done recently, trying to reform the mind-bogglingly large amounts of land owned by the British royal family.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/dec/28/revolt-royals-rewilding

<p>See in the new year with a dish of lentils – a symbol of luck, wealth and happiness – and succulent pork or vegetarian sausages</p><p><strong><br /></strong>Thinking about the future prosperity of my family and friends, I recently carried two packets of lentils from Rome to Dorset. A wholly unnecessary exercise considering how widely available they are in the UK, but I did it to make myself feel important, I suppose. And so that, on New Year’s Eve, around the stroke of midnight, I can call everyone into the kitchen to eat a spoonful or seven, to ensure thriving good fortune and happiness in 2024. At least that is the idea.</p><p>Along with barley, pea, chickpea, bitter vetch, emmer wheat, einkorn wheat and flax, lentils are one of the eight neolithic founder crops domesticated as early as 12,000 years ago in the fertile crescent – what is now southern Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Palestine, Israel, Egypt, and parts of Turkey and Iran.

## From Bellingham to Wharton: 10 rising EFL stars to look out for in 2024

<p>We select players aged 21 or under with a bright future, including a Birmingham midfielder tipped to go ‘to the top’ </p><p>Perhaps the most obvious name on this list, Jude’s younger brother left Birmingham in the summer and instantly assumed an instrumental role in Sunderland’s attack. He wears his first name on the back of his No 7 shirt, born from his desire to craft his own burgeoning reputation. He has been reunited with sporting director Kristjaan Speakman and the coaches Mike Dodds and Stuart English, all of whom were influential in his development at Birmingham. The rangy attacking midfielder, who has also starred as a striker, has made a big splash but debate over his best position continues. “I enjoy playing as a box-to-box midfielder the most,” Bellingham said recently. He made his England Under-19s debut in September.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/dec/28/from-jobe-bellingham-to-adam-wharton-10-rising-efl-stars-2024">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The conversation is stuck: you’re either ‘playing the race card’ or ‘in denial’. But here’s a way to break through</p><p>The national conversation on racism seems to be stuck in an endless loop. We all know the routine: a public debate is sparked by a news story that features a case of alleged bigotry. It might be reports that an Asian cricketer was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/dec/08/essex-players-faced-racist-abuse-and-discrimination-report-finds">nicknamed “Bomber”</a>; or that a member of the royal family is said to have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/nov/30/inquiry-naming-king-charles-catherine-duchess-sussex-kate-royal-book-race-harry-meghan">questioned a baby’s skin colour</a>.

<p>From a Guy Ritchie action comedy to a revealing documentary about journalism, Guardian writers pick their favourite underseen films of the year</p><p>You Hurt My Feelings was a big hit at Sundance 12 months ago. Of course it was – Nicole Holofcener and Julia Louis-Dreyfus are the crack squad of Woody Allen-ish middle-class Manhattan first world problem cerebral comedy-dramas. But it was released way too early in the US, and then way too small in the UK – straight to streaming, in fact. That’s bananas: this is a terrific picture, fresh and funny and true and interesting. In short, Louis-Dreyfus is a novelist who overhears her shrink husband (Tobias Menzies) telling his friend he didn’t like her latest manuscript – despite having assured her to the contrary. Small fry in the bigger picture, sure, but the sort of betrayal (or, perhaps, loyalty) the movies don’t much get into, and played with an intelligence and a humour and a lightness of touch that only serves to make the upset more

They now live separately in San Francisco, but plan to retire to the country together</p><p>By 2013, Christine had been working for the Burning Man arts festival for many years. She lived in San Francisco and, though she had an active social life, found it difficult to meet a partner she felt compatible with. “I’d been on plenty of dates, but nothing really clicked,” she says. “I think it’s harder to date after 60.

<p>Blazing a trail as a hot young thing is not for everyone – sometimes life gets in the way. We meet three artists who have taken a more roundabout route</p><p>There is a particular stereotype of creative genius: that of the youthful prodigy of irrepressible talent. Unlike a surgeon or a politician, the artist is not expected to accumulate years of knowledge and experience before assuming their role. You could say that one does not become but rather is born an artist.</p><p>Yet history offers plenty of counter-examples. The French post-impressionist Henri Rousseau worked as a toll-and-tax collector until picking up a paintbrush in his 40s. Alfred Wallis, a West Country fisher, started painting and drawing in his 70s. After his wife’s death, he began making his pictures of life on the coast and sea, mostly on scraps of cardboard, “for company”, he once said. American folk artist Grandma Moses, a domestic housekeeper turned farmer, began producing her New England landscapes at 76; her

<p>South Africa and their inspirational captain, Siya Kolisi, won their three knockout games in France by a single point</p><p>It is a relatively little-known fact that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the creator of Sherlock Holmes, was a keen rugby fan. He travelled to France, South Africa and New Zealand to watch games and, in 1924, wrote in his autobiography that he regarded rugby as “the best collective sport” because of its physical and mental requirements. Even Holmes’ trusty companion, Watson, was credited with playing on the wing for England’s oldest club, Blackheath, back in the day.</p><p>So what would the famous detective have deduced, almost exactly a century later, from studying the 2023 Rugby World Cup?

<p>There’s joy to be found in the darkest winter months, and people living in cold places use a variety of rituals to celebrate the lack of light – and its eventual return</p><p>These long evenings at the year’s turn, when dusk seems to fall just after lunch, take me back to the extreme polar night I spent on a small, rocky island off the west coast of Greenland a few winters ago. The inhabitants of the Upernavik archipelago have no sight of the sun from late November to January. When I received the email inviting me to work in the artist’s “refuge” at the island museum – described as the most northerly in the world – I was offered a choice of summer or winter. “Contrary to the summertime,” wrote the museum director, “the darkness of the winter to many southerners seems like a terrible and nasty time lying in wait. But when one gets accustomed to the darkness it allows an interlude for thought that one usually lacks.”</p><p>It was true. As I acclimatised to the continuous darkness, I

<p>Ramsay MacDonald’s short-lived victory holds three key lessons and helps explain the difficulties and defeats since 1924</p><p>Next year’s general election will be the 22nd in Britain’s postwar history. Only a handful of these can be described as pivotal. Three stand out: Clement Attlee’s Labour victory in 1945, Margaret Thatcher’s Conservative win in 1979 and, more debatably, Tony Blair’s Labour landslide in 1997. Boris Johnson’s 2019 win might have been a fourth, but it has proved a lurch into a cul-de-sac. Today we may possibly be on the threshold of another of these rare change-making elections. Scepticism about that prospect is sensible.</p><p>As time passes, individual elections cease to echo with shared meaning as they once did.
