 The case against Malaysia Airlines, Boeing, and other companies over the liability was heard in a Court in Beijing, between November 27th and December 6th. 
The disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 has been called one of the "biggest mysteries in aviation history". Because of the large number of Chinese among the passengers, we have reviewed information from the media in and outside of China. In this episode, we will present what we believe to be a relatively logical explanation involving Chinese politics.
