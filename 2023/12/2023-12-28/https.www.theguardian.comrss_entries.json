Only a handful of these can be described as pivotal. Three stand out: Clement Attlee\u2019s Labour victory in 1945, Margaret Thatcher\u2019s Conservative win in 1979 and, more debatably, Tony Blair\u2019s Labour landslide in 1997. Boris Johnson\u2019s 2019 win might have been a fourth, but it has proved a lurch into a cul-de-sac. Today we may possibly be on the threshold of another of these rare change-making elections. Scepticism about that prospect is sensible.</p><p>As time passes, individual elections cease to echo with shared meaning as they once did. There is, though, one more pivotal general election that ought to resonate today. It took place exactly a hundred years ago this month.
