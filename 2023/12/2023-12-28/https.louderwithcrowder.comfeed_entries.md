So much so that some spoiled brats forget that the rest of the world actually enforces laws when it comes to things like assault and theft.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>There are many reasons why this video probably made you mad. One, we see what appears to be two very entitled degenerates trying to steal and take advantage of people who are just trying to make an honest living. Not only that, these presumably honest workers are in a part of the world where they are not as fortunate when it comes to economic success as America or London. </p><p>I d

I don’t ever remember a time in history when a Mayor focused all his energy on the people from another country. I don’t ever recall when elected local officials prioritized city services for people who are from another nation over 2,000 miles away. But that time has come to an end. Because we now have a bandwagon of Mayors throwing their constituents to the curb while they take the hard-earned dollars of Americans and give it to people who should not even be here. </p><p>Two people come to mind when we think of the leaders of the migrant movement. Brandon Johnson and Eric Adams. Chicago and New York are run by progressives. Chicago has not even elected a republican mayor in over 100 years. We already know what happens when liberals start running thing

Oh, you want to eat? Too bad, sandwiches get in the way of their rain dances. Did you want some eggs for breakfast? I'm so sorry, but eggs cause Tsunamis. They just do. Okay?! </p><p>My two least favorite movements out of the progressive religious cult have got to be the vegan movement and climate alarmism. Coincidentally, the two go hand in hand. </p><p>Now, the head of the WHO has declared war on FOOD because “our food systems” harm "the health of people and planet.” And no, he has not offered a “better” solution that would be able to feed the billions of people alive today. Essentially, he is de facto saying that you should not have the right to grow or eat food because it might change the direction of th

I'm all in for Ron DeSantis, but if voters disagree with me I'll vote for whoever the nominee is because any of our candidates are preferable to the radical progressives who run Joe Biden. However, it would be nice if some GOP candidates stopped making it so difficult to do.

Though, it would appear people who compete in chess at a competitive level like to wild out as we've learned with a now former world chess champion. He was stripped of his title after taking a dookie in a bathtub. And that doesn't even get into the anal beads scandal.</p><p><em>"But Brodigan, the chess anal beads scandal was from last year."</em></p><p>No, this is a SECOND time anal beads have come up in the world of competitive chess. And LOL, you said "butt."</p><p>Yan Chenglong defeated dozens of competitors in a ferocious Chinese Chess competition, earning the title of Xiangqi King. His reign was short-lived. <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-12-27/chinese-chess-rocked-by-cheating-rumours-bad-behaviour-scandal/103266594" target="_blank">Ch

	We've had a nice stroll down memory lane this week about the CHOP/CHAZ era of American History. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/chaz-seattle-lawsuit" target="_blank">A man shot during 2020's "Summer of Love" announced he is suing the city</a>. And the infamous "community garden" that CHAZadonians created has been taken down. How it took the Seattle government FOUR YEARS to do this is beyond me. But I also live out in real America.

	The garden, <a href="https://komonews.com/news/local/seattle-dismantles-community-garden-birthed-from-black-lives-matter-movement-cal-anderson-protests-demonstrations-safety-homeless" target="_blank">located in Cal Anderson’s Sun Bowl area</a>, was taken back by the city to be put to good use, at the expense of garden supporters who have never been of any use.
