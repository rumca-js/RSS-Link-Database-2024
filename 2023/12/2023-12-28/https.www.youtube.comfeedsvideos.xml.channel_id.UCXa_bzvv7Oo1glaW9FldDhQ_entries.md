Role-playing games have always stood as one of the more encompassing genres in gaming.

Even the basic mechanics of leveling and increasing stats have roots in RPGs.

There may be a game with an inconceivable range of permutations for your decisions, with unforgettable companions. Others may let you explore the farthest reaches of space and create your own fun. Then there are those built on the drive to min-max and take on more challenging enemies.

The Xbox Series X/S hasn't always been the best with exclusives, especially first-party titles. After all the acquisitions made over the years, it still faltered behind the PlayStation 5. However, things have slowly improved, as best exemplified by this year in gaming.

It began with Tango Gameworks' Hi-Fi Rush stealth-launching out of nowhere in January and immediately becoming a favorite for many players. Though the release of Arkane's Redfall was a downer, exclusives like Starfield and Forza Motorsport garnered strong reviews, with the former also setting new records for Game Pass subscribers.

Fortunately, even if you wanted to indulge in some third-party titles, the Xbox Series X/S offered plenty of those. Let's look at the best Xbox game of 2023 and all the others that provided hundreds of hours of gaming.
