The expansion of the electric vehicle (EV) landscape globally has raised concerns about EV fires. A recent incident involving a Tesla Model Y catching fire in Alabama highlights the challenges in extinguishing EV fires. Unlike traditional vehicle fires, water alone is not sufficient to put out a fire in an EV battery due to the risk of thermal runaway. Solid-state batteries, which use solid electrolytes instead of flammable liquids, offer a safer alternative to conventional lithium-ion batteries. These batteries have higher energy density, allowing for increased vehicle range. However, challenges remain in designing stable and cost-effective solid-state batteries.

An ongoing multi-city wastewater surveillance study by TIGS, Bengaluru found that the JN.1 Covid-19 variant is the predominant strain in Bengaluru's wastewater samples. The study, supported by the Rockefeller Foundation, showed a 96% positivity rate for SARS-CoV-2 across 26 Sewage Treatment Plants during December 11-22. The viral load in the samples increased three-fold from December 18 to 22. TIGS submitted the data to BBMP. The study suggests a silent wave of infections with less severe symptoms, but senior citizens and those with comorbidities should remain cautious.

The Karnataka high court has observed that unsubstantiated adultery allegations made by a man against his wife, doubting the paternity of their child, amount to him inflicting mental cruelty on his wife. The court stated that this conduct constitutes sufficient cause for her to withdraw from his society. The court also directed the husband to pay costs to his wife. The family court had previously granted divorce to the husband, but the high court set aside this decision, stating that the allegations of adultery and paternity did not meet the parameters set by the Supreme Court.
