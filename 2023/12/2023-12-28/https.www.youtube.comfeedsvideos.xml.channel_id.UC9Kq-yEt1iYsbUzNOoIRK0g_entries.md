It’s crazy to think that in a decade, we witnessed the rise and fall of the DC Extended Universe. With occasional hits like Wonder Woman and Aquaman, accompanied by LOTS of flops like Black Adam, Shazam 2, Blue Beetle, The Flash, Suicide Squad and more… this was kind of inevitable. 



Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom definitely raises some questions. Like did we just Ctrl-Z Aquaman’s growth from the last movie? Why is Arthur making Goofy noises? Where’s the Justice League when you need them?



To answer all these questions, check out the pitch meeting that led to Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom!
