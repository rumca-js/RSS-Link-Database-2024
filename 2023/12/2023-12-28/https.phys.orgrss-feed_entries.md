Trophic ecology is the study of the food chain. On Tenerife in the Canary Islands, feral cats feast chiefly on rabbits, mice, rats, and native birds and reptiles. But new research shows that since 1986, the island's wild cats have experienced a significant shift in their dietary composition, which bodes poorly for several native species.

For decades, a substantial number of proteins, vital for treating various diseases, have remained elusive to oral drug therapy. Traditional small molecules often struggle to bind to proteins with flat surfaces or require specificity for particular protein homologs. Typically, larger biologics that can target these proteins demand injection, limiting patient convenience and accessibility.

Chiral optical materials have attracted great attention in multiple disciplines due to their wide application value in fields such as remote sensing, three-dimensional display, information communication, and optical information storage. With the strong demand for stable and environmentally-friendly materials, two-dimensional, chiral, lead-free halide double perovskites are expected to generate rich chiroptical and optoelectronic properties.

Awns, bristle-like extensions on grass crops like wheat and barley, are vital for protection and seed dispersal, with barbs on their surface playing a crucial role. While the genetic basis of barb formation has been explored through genome-wide association and genetic mapping, the detailed analysis of these small, variable structures poses a challenge.

Neutron-star cores contain matter at the highest densities reached in our present-day universe, with as much as two solar masses of matter compressed inside a sphere of 25 km in diameter. These astrophysical objects can indeed be thought of as giant atomic nuclei, with gravity compressing their cores to densities exceeding those of individual protons and neutrons many-fold.
