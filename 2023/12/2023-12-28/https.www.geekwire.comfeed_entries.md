Five decades later, the same sentiment sums up The New York Times Co.&#8217;s lawsuit against Microsoft and OpenAI this week. The suit alleges that the companies wrongly used vast amounts of copyrighted material from the newspaper to train the large language models that power ChatGPT and other artificial intelligence models.

Birmingham, Ala.-based Shipt works like same-day delivery companies such as DoorDash and Instacart, employing gig workers to pick and/or deliver groceries and other items. Target acquired Shipt in 2017 for $550 million. In an emailed statement to GeekWire, Shipt said action taken by the Seattle City Council will impose significant operational challenges that would impact its ability to be compliant and continue providing value and service.

Total funding to Pacific Northwest startups fell nearly 60% year-over-year in 2023, according to GeekWire&#8217;s funding list. And not a single unicorn was crowned this year — after nine reached the $1 billion valuation threshold in 2021. But there were still a handful of startups across the region that raised sizable funding rounds to fuel growth in the months and years ahead. Biotech, health tech, and aerospace companies reeled in some of the biggest chunks of cash.&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/vc-investments-slowed-in-2023-but-these-pacific-northwest-startups-still-raised-sizable-rounds/">Read More<

This year began with high hopes for aerospace companies with a significant presence in the Seattle area, ranging from Boeing to Blue Origin to SpaceX. A lot of those hopes had to be put on hold, basically because everything in the space industry takes longer than expected. Nevertheless, there were plenty of developments worthy of note in the aerospace world, including a milestone&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/year-in-space-aerospace-2023/">Read More</a>
