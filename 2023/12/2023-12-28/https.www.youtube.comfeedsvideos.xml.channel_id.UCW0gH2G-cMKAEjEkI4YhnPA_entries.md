Shards of Narsil Product Description:
Narsil™ is perhaps the most famous sword in The Lord of the Rings trilogy. A great battle was fought against Sauron™ at the end of the Second Age of Middle-earth, the Last Alliance of Elves and Men. Narsil's blade was shattered by Sauron as Elendil fell, creating the Shards of Narsil. The Shards were kept in Rivendell, the house of Elrond™, for safe keeping. Legend tells that the sword would one day be re-forged and the king would return. The 1/5 scale miniature Shards of Narsil are presented with a hand-painted cold cast polyresin statue of an Elven Princess cradling a shield that the removable shards lay upon. This updated true color version reflects the actual tan color of the stone statue and blue velvet cloth rather than the blue stone and silver cloth colors from the previous version.
