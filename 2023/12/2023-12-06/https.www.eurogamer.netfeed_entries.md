Employees at Destiny 2 developer Bungie have said they feel anxious about their current status at the company, following layoffs earlier this year.
</p><p>
As you may recall, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-2-developer-bungie-latest-playstation-studio-to-be-hit-by-layoffs">layoffs were first reported at the developer in October</a>. At this time, studio CEO Pete Parsons publicly commented on the cuts, calling it "a sad day". Around 100 employees were said to be affected.
</p><p>
Now, in a new report by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-devs-say-atmosphere-is-soul-crushing-amid-layoffs-cuts-and-fear-of-total-sony-takeover">IGN</a>, many remaining at the company have said the studio is implementing a variety of other cost-cutting measures across the board, in order to remain an indep

It looks like a remake of Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons is on the cards.
</p><p>
The news originates from <a href="https://twitter.com/IdleSloth84_/status/1732405964924731585">Bibilkun</a>, who has a proven track record of being accurate with this type of information. According to the leaker, the game will be published by 505, as the original was in 2013.
</p><p>
Since Bilbilkun's claim, where they suggested we may get an announcement at tomorrow's Game Awards, fellow video game focused account <a href="https://twitter.com/IdleSloth84_/status/1732421657439215718">Idle Sloth</a> noted that the <a href="https://www.brothersthegame.com/">brothersthegame</a> website now has a countdown on its page.

## Bethesda tries its hand at paid mods in Skyrim Special Edition once again

Sure the game is several years old now, but it is still very popular with players, so why not give the game a boost if it needs it.</p><p>
However, this particular update has gone down rather badly with Skyrimmers, as it has reintroduced a paid mod platform into the game. </p><p>To get you up to speed as to why this has been controversial, all the way back in 2015, Bethesda partnered with Valve to bring paid mods to Skyrim via Steam. However, it was incredibly unpopular with both players and mod makers, and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-removes-paid-mods-in-skyrim">publisher removed the option to sell Skyrim mods on Valve's platform</a> shortly after this idea made its debut. </p> <p><a href="htt

## Does Grand Theft Auto 6 deliver the generational leap we were hoping for?

The first Grand Theft Auto 6 trailer has arrived - a little ahead of schedule - and despite its minuscule run-time, it's an important piece of media. Not only is this our first look at what's likely to be the biggest game of the generation, it's also our first indication of how Rockstar has innovated its technology for the latest PlayStation and Xbox hardware. It's doubly significant bearing in mind that the only GTA game of the PS4 and Xbox One era was an enhanced version of a title originally built for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. In essence, we're looking at a technological leap that encompasses two console generations - and even with the meagre amount of material we have to look at, it's already looking highly promising.
</p><p>
First of all, as always with trailers - particularly debut trailers - we have to examine the plausi

In a move you wouldn't typically expect from a developer, Studio Wildcard has admitted 
Ark's servers are basically complete "ass".
</p><p>
Speaking as part of Studio Wildcard's Extra Life Charity Stream on <a href="https://clips.twitch.tv/PlumpFaithfulNigiriFunRun-xVHoLd5QE47QJW8s">Twitch</a>, co-founder Jeremy Stieglitz stated several times over that Ark: Survival Ascended's servers are total "ass". In fact, he said it three times.
</p><p>
"The servers are ass. They run like ass. And their stability is ass," he admitted during the stream.

League of Geeks has paused development on Jumplight Odyssey "indefinitely", as the studio cuts 50 percent of its workforce.
</p><p>
In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1893820/Jumplight_Odyssey/">blog</a> update, studio director Trent Kusters called this a "devastating position" for the team to find themselves in. 
</p><p>
"Though our commitment to our beloved starship adventure sim is unwavering, rapidly rising operation costs, a worsening AUD/USD exchange rate, poor Early Access sales, and the unprecedented withdrawal of funding opportunities across the industry, have placed us in a position where, as it currently stands, we are unable to sustain the cost of operations through to the release of v1.0, which was planned for Q2 of 2024," Kusters wrote.

The Lamplighters League might have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-declares-pulp-strategy-the-lamplighters-league-a-22m-flop">officially flopped</a> according to publisher Paradox Interactive, but that hasn't stopped developer Harebrained Schemes from making improvements to its pulp strategy adventure since its arrival - and its latest free update is perhaps its biggest yet, adding a new playable character and new events system.
</p><p>
The Lamplighters League, which launched to a mix reception back in October, blends tactical turn-based action and real-time stealth in a globe-trotting adventure inspired by the classic pulp stories of the 1930s, putting players in control of a disparate group of rogues as they attempt to thwart an occult-obsessed cabal known as the Banished Court.
