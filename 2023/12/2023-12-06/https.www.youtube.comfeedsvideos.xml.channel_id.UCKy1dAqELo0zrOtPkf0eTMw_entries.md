Is grease a liquid? There was a lot of it in Baldur’s Gate 3. What about sand, which is sort of like a liquid, except not really? There was a lot of sand in 2023’s biggest games, from Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 to Forspoken to Assassin’s Creed Mirage.

Reviewed by Tristan Ogilvie on PC. Also available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Amazon Luna.

"Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora features a stunning alien world to explore with a refreshingly uncluttered approach to navigation, countless enemy bases to destroy and Na’vi clan sidequests to complete, and no shortage of exotic flora and fauna to harvest and hunt. However, its combat is pretty one-dimensional, its mission design is a bit on the repetitive side, and its environment is generally lacking in any major surprises beyond visual splendor, meaning that Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is a solid shooting adventure that’s more inside the box than truly out of this world."

If Rockstar hadn’t dropped the trailer for Grand Theft Auto 6 this week, all we’d be talking about is what’s getting revealed during The Game Awards. Based on how much GTA 6 has already broken the internet, it’s hard to even imagine what kind of game-related announcement could come close to generating this level of excitement. Half-Life 3? The Elder Scrolls 6? The next Nintendo Switch? A Fortnite movie? We discuss exactly how huge of a footprint Rockstar’s flagship open-world series has on not just gaming, but pop-culture as a whole. But still, we’ll need something to help pass the time until 2025, maybe it’ll be one of the games Geoff Keighley reveals during the TGAs.
