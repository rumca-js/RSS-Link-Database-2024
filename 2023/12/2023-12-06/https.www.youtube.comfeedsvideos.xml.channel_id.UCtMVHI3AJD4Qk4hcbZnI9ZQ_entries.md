Hello guys and gals, it's me Mutahar again! When it comes to total conversion mods a.k.a mods that are designed to change a game into something else entirely I've found a lost mod that was sitting on my hard drives that turns San Andreas into a pretty faithful remake of Terminator 2. I haven't seen anyone cover this in years so I decided to sit down and try this out. Thanks for watching!
