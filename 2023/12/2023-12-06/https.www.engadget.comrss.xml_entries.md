<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/overwatch-2/"><em>Overwatch 2's</em></a> eighth season went live on Tuesday and things aren't exactly going smoothly for everyone. Some are complaining about performance issues, particularly concerning frame rates on PlayStation 5. On <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/overwatch/t/ps5-extreme-fps-drops/865494">Blizzard's own forums</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/18ca7bk/unplayable_on_ps5/">Reddit</a>, players are suggesting that even the menus are lagging on the console.</p>
<p>&quot;I play on PS5 with 120 Hz monitor and settings for that output, but randomly either in [fights] or walking back from spawn, even on menus, I am dropping down to what seems like single digit to low double digit frames per second,&quot; a player who goes by Sartell <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/overwatch/t/massive-frame-rate-drops-console/865539/3"><ins>wrote</ins></a>.

Version 5.1 boasts a spate of enhancements, including new waveshapers, new filters, polyphonic voice stacking, a dual oscillator and more. This is especially good news for avid sound designers, as the filters and waveshapers should allow for plenty of tinkering to find that perfect tone.</p>
<p>The filters are all rather unique, going a step further than a simple lowpass or something. For instance, the Fizz filter offers two separate cutoffs with embedded feedback. The Rasp filter is bright and resonant with a host of adjustment options. Vowels is a morphing format filter with an array of m

<p>For those who are at risk of permanently losing their voice due to conditions like Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, ALS and vocal cord paralysis, not sounding like yourself can be yet another form of identity loss. Being able to create a copy of your voice while you’re still able might help alleviate the feeling that you’ll never feel like yourself again, or that your loved ones won’t know what y

<p>Apple’s latest tvOS beta suggests the iTunes Movies and TV Shows apps on Apple TV are on their way out. <em>9to5Mac</em> <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/12/06/itunes-movies-and-tv-shows-app-discontinued-apple-tv/">reports</a> the set-top box’s former home of streaming purchases and rentals is no longer in the tvOS 17.2 release candidate (RC), now available to developers. (Unless Apple finds unexpected bugs, RC firmware usually ends up identical to the public version.)

<p>Scientists have developed a new implantable device that has the potential to change the way Type 1 diabetics receive insulin. The thread-like implant, or SHEATH (Subcutaneous Host-Enabled Alginate THread), is installed in a two-step process that ultimately leads to the deployment of “islet devices,” which are derived from the cells that produce insulin in our bodies naturally.</p>
<p>First, the scientists figured out a way to insert nylon catheters under the skin, where they remain for up to six weeks. After insertion, blood vessels form around the catheters which structurally support the islet devices that are placed in the space when the catheter gets removed. The newly implanted 10-centimeter-long islet devices secrete insulin via islet cells that form around it, while also receiving nutrients and oxygen from blood vessels to stay alive.</p>

<p>Wednesday marks the 25th anniversary of the International Space Station’s (ISS) physical assembly in orbit. On December 6, 1998, the crew aboard the space shuttle Endeavor attached the US-built Unity node to the Russian-built Zarya module, kicking off the modular construction of the ISS. A quarter century later, we look back at the milestones and breakthroughs from one of humanity’s most impressive marvels of engineering and international cooperation.</p>
<p>The ISS, which orbits the Earth 16 times every 24 hours at a speed of five miles per second, has been inhabited by researchers for over 23 years. It’s the product of five space agencies from 15 countries. NASA, Roscosmos (Russia’s national space agency), ESA (European Space Agency), JAXA (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency) and CSA (Canadian Space Agency) have contributed to the station’s assembly and operation.</p>

<p>Foreign governments likely spy on your smart phone usage, and now <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/23/12/06/senators-paranoia-opens-door-for-apple-to-speak-out-on-government-censorship">Senator Ron Wyden's office is pushing</a> for Apple and Google to reveal how exactly it works. Push notifications, the dings you get from apps calling your attention back to your phone, may be handed over from a company to government services if asked. But it appears the Department of Justice won't let companies come clean about the practice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Push notifications don't actually come straight from the app. Instead, they pass through the smart phone provider, like Apple for iPhones or Google for Androids, to deliver the notifications to your screen. This has created murky room for government surveillance. &quot;Because Apple and Google deliver push notification data, they can be secretly compelled by governments to hand over this information,&quot; Wyden wrote in the letter on We

<p>OpenAI's spot atop the generative AI heap may be coming to an end as Google officially introduced its most capable large language model to date on Wednesday, dubbed <a href="https://deepmind.google/AlphaCode2_Tech_Report.pdf"><ins>Gemini 1.0</ins></a>. It's the first of “a new generation of AI models, inspired by the way people understand and interact with the world,” CEO Sundar Pichai wrote in <a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-gemini-ai"><ins>a Google blog post</ins></a>.</p>
<p>“Ever since programming AI for computer games as a teenager, and throughout my years as a neuroscience researcher trying to understand the workings of the brain, I’ve always believed that if we could build smarter machines, we could harness them to benefit humanity in incredible ways,” Pichai continued.</p>

<p>Google is bringing Gemini, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/googles-answer-to-gpt-4-is-gemini-the-most-capable-model-weve-ever-built-150039571.html">new large language model it just introduced</a>, to Android, beginning with the Pixel 8 Pro. The company’s flagship smartphone will run Gemini Nano, a version of the model built specifically to run locally on smaller devices, Google announced in a blog post. The Pixel 8 Pro is powered by the Google Tensor G3 chip <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-tensor-g3-soc-pixel-8-pro-143052356.html">designed</a> to speed up AI performance.</p>
<p>This lets the Pixel 8 Pro add several smarts to existing features. The phone’s Recorder app, for instance, has a Summarize feature that currently needs a network connection to give you a summary of recorded conversations, interviews, and presentations. But thanks to Gemini Nano, the phone will now be able to provide a summary without needing a connection at all.</p>

<p>Half of London's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-10-22-london-efficient-black-cabs.html">black cab fleet</a> is now made up of zero-emission vehicles, manufacturer LEVC and Transport for London (TfL) <a href="https://levc.com/levcs-electric-tx-now-makes-up-half-of-londons-black-cab-fleet/">announced</a>. Of the 14,690 licensed taxis in the capital, 7,972 are battery electric vehicles (BEVs), with most manufactured by Geely's LEVC, according to the latest figures. The number of those models grew a fairly dramatic 10 percent in the last month alone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Reaching this milestone is a great reflection of how London is working hard to be a greener, more sustainable, environmentally friendly city," said TfL's Helen Chapman. "London's black taxis are recognized worldwide and we are proud to see that so many drivers are helping clean up the air."&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a controversial COP28 continues in Dubai, a new report emphasizes that &quot;the world is on a disastrous trajectory.&quot; <a href="https://global-tipping-points.org/summary-report/narrative-summary/">The Global Tipping Points report</a> emphasized the need for an immediate phasing out of fossil fuels and a commitment to beneficial solutions. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ipcc-2021-climate-change-report-182200028.html">Tipping points</a> are small thresholds that, when crossed, spark a series of events, including the passage of other tipping points.&nbsp;</p>

## The Morning After: Microsoft upgrades its Copilot chatbot

<p>Microsoft says its Copilot AI chatbot is integrating with OpenAI’s latest GPT model and the image generator DALL-E 3, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-upgrades-copilot-with-openais-gpt-4-turbo-and-dall-e-3-162558170.html">among other upgrades</a>. GPT-4 Turbo integration will help Copilot users tackle even more complex tasks. While the last generation allowed for up to 50 pages of text as a data input, GPT-4 Turbo accepts up to 300 pages, which should make for more meaningful (and accurate, I hope) responses to queries. The newest DALL-E 3 image generation model should generate higher-quality images, with better accuracy for your prompts.</p>
<p>Beyond the OpenAI collaborations, Copilot’s Inline Compose tool now includes a rewrite menu, so you can select a block of text (in Edge) and get a bot-edited version. Code Interpreter will apparently help users perform complex tasks like “data analysis, visualization, math” and plain old coding.</p>
