## How drugs can target the thick 'scar tissue' of pancreatic cancer

Researchers discovered how anti-cancer drugs called HDAC inhibitors help treat pancreatic cancer by altering scar tissue (fibroblast) development. The findings suggest HDAC inhibitors could be powerful tools in fighting pancreatic cancer -- alone and in combination with other therapies.

New research has shown that fire-ice -- frozen methane which is trapped as a solid under our oceans -- is vulnerable to melting due to climate change and could be released into the sea.

## Greenhouse gases in oceans are altered by climate change impact on microbes

The ocean is a global life-support system, and climate change causes such as ocean warming, acidification, deoxygenation, and nitrogen-deposition alter the delicate microbial population in oceans. The marine microbial community plays an important role in the production of greenhouse gases like nitrous oxide and methane. Scientists have explored the climate change impact on marine microbes. Their research helps raise awareness about climate change severity and the importance of ocean resources.

## Repeated blast exposures may harm the brain health of military personnel

The brains of special warfare community personnel repeatedly exposed to blasts show increased inflammation and structural changes compared with a control group, potentially increasing the risk of long-term, brain-related disease, according to a new study.

## New findings reveal important insights into age-related nonresolving inflammation

Aging is associated with chronic, nonresolving inflammation, or 'inflammaging,' that can lead to tissue dysfunction. New findings reveal insights into the cellular programs and factors that promote the resolution of inflammation during aging. These findings may lead to the development of new strategies to limit age-related organ decline.

## Blood hormone levels key to identifying which post-menopausal women will benefit most from taking anastrozole to prevent breast cancer

## Grinding coffee with a splash of water reduces static electricity and makes more consistent and intense espresso

The fracturing and friction of coffee beans during grinding generates electricity that causes coffee particles to clump together and stick to the grinder. Researchers report that coffee beans with higher internal moisture produce less static electricity, which means less coffee is wasted and there is less mess to clean up. This effect can be simulated by adding a small amount of water to beans immediately before grinding them. The team also showed that grinding with a splash of water produces more consistent and intense espresso.

## Researchers redesign future mRNA therapeutics to prevent potentially harmful immune responses

Researchers have discovered that misreading of therapeutic mRNAs by the cell's decoding machinery can cause an unintended immune response in the body. They have identified the sequence within the mRNA that causes this to occur and found a way to prevent 'off-target' immune responses to enable the safer design of future mRNA therapeutics.

Scientists have identified abnormal aggregates of a protein called TAF15 in the brains of individuals with early-onset dementia, known as frontotemporal dementia, where the cause was not previously known.

## Stellar winds regulate growth of galaxies

Galactic winds enable the exchange of matter between galaxies and their surroundings. In this way, they limit the growth of galaxies, that is, their star formation rate. Although this had already been observed in the local universe, an international research team has just revealed the existence of the phenomenon in galaxies which are more than 7 billion years old and actively forming stars, the category to which most galaxies belong. The team's findings thus show this is a universal process.
