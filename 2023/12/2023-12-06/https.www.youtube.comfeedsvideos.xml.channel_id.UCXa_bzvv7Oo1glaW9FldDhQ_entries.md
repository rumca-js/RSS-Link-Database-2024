Xbox players have faced a grueling wait to get their hands on Baldur’s Gate 3. Owing to issues with split-screen co-op optimization, the version slated for Microsoft’s home console has suffered delays.

Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora does have some issues with its gear system, gathering mechanics and side quests, but it's still a fun experience.

Grand Theft Auto 6 is now an officially announced game, rather than the idea of one that we’ve been waiting on for a decade, and though it’s probably going to be a while before we get another trailer (if Rockstar’s track record with previous major releases is anything to go by), the trailer that we do have right now is a deceptively meaty one. 

Though just a minute and a half long, Grand Theft Auto 6’s reveal trailer is densely packed full of tiny, hidden details about its world, its characters, its gameplay activities, and more. Here, we are going to take a look at a few such hidden details in the reveal trailer of Rockstar’s upcoming open world epic.
