<p>For a while now Aston Villa have openly and confidently declared qualifying for the Champions League is their chief objective this season and, on this evidence, after defeating and disposing of Manchester City, they will be in the conversation for the long haul. Leon Bailey blasted Villa in front on 74 minutes and City could not argue it had not been coming on a chastening evening to forget for Pep Guardiola, now an unprecedented winless in four Premier League matches.</p><p>Villa were fortuitous Bailey’s strike looped in via Rúben Dias but by that point they had more than created their own luck with a rip-roaring performance. By the end, City were on the ropes, Ederson reeling as his defence crumbled in front of him. Douglas Luiz, the one-time City midfielder, cracked a shot against a post as Villa hunted for a second.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/dec/06/aston-villa-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

He was recorded as being under investigation, after his landlady asked for him to be removed from her house because he had not disclosed to her that he had tuberculosis. At the time, tuberculosis was considered to be contagious in Rome, so it would have been difficult and expensive for Keats to find accommodation had he been honest about his illness.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/dec/06/keats-scholar-finds-that-roman-police-investigated-poet-before-death">Continue reading...</a>

Nothing too heavy, you understand, as serious theology is quite beyond me. And I’m certainly not evangelising; often as not I’m just trying to keep a conversation ticking over. I restrict myself to a single aphorism, which goes like this: there are no atheists in a penalty shootout. I contend that most fans of the teams involved engage in something approximating prayer. The only exception, generally, will be the fans behind the goal who support the team whose goalkeeper is attempting to save the penalty about to be taken. As the player prepares to strike the ball, these fans may well pause their prayers to make hostile noises and obscene hand gestures in an attempt to put the penalty taker off. But by the time a player on their team is preparing to t

However, in the northern regions of eastern Europe, the rituals remain, steeped in centuries of tradition. In these places, there is little-to-no sun for many months of the year.

<p>When they last tried to relocate this critically endangered species, only two females survived. Have conservationists learned enough to end a 40-year local extinction?</p><p>For more than five years, the two black rhinos in Chad’s Zakouma national park have lived a lonely existence. It wasn’t meant to be that way. In May 2018, the pair of females were part of a group of six critically endangered black rhinos that African Parks helped translocate from South Africa to Zakouma. But within days of release into their new home, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-chad-rhinos-safrica-idUSKCN1NB2BS/">four had died</a>.</p><p>“It happened very quickly. It’s not a pure science, doing translocations,” says Martin Rickelton, African Parks’ regional operations manager. “An awful lot of work went into feasibility studies – experts looked at everything.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/dec/06/the-five-black-rhinos-flown-2700-miles-on-a-mission-to-repopulate-chad

<p><strong>Young Vic, London</strong><br />Playing a man meeting his daughter-in-law for the first time, Jared Harris brings out the dark comedy in Pinter’s snapshot of misogyny</p><p>Harold Pinter’s two-act family drama has variously been seen as an Oedipal struggle between fathers and sons, a misogynistic tract that fatally sexualises its female character and, diametrically, likened to Henrik Ibsen for a wife’s rejection of respectable married life in lieu of a flagrantly independent existence. What to make of it in our post-#MeToo age?</p><p>Matthew Dunster’s production, intentionally or otherwise, appears more like a snapshot of misogyny at its most unapologetic, as university professor Teddy (Robert Emms) returns to his febrile, all-male, working-class family home after years of estrangement with his wife, Ruth (Lisa Diveney), in tow.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/dec/06/the-homecoming-review-young-vic-jared-harris-harold-pinter-toxic-masculinity">Continue

<p>Over the last decade, the charity has taught thousands of young people life lessons on the pitch and in the classroom</p><p>A couple of years after Jasper Kain and Jack Reynolds co-founded the charity Football Beyond Borders they travelled to Salvador, one of the host cities for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. Kain was partly there to make a film about football but he also made connections between visitors and locals. “We ran a football tournament, where we paired football fans with families that were living in the favelas,” Kain says. “The idea was to give the locals some income as well as to unite them with fans because they couldn’t access any of the spoils as they didn’t speak any English.”</p><p>This was a long way from the early days of FBB, which initially ran weekly football sessions in Kennington Park for 16- to 21-year-olds as well as a homework club at a school in Croydon for a younger age group, 75% of whom are at risk of exclusion. Kain and Reynolds are both from south

It was 5C when the squad boarded the plane and 35C when they got off it. All of which topsy-turviness sums up the twist club rugby has got itself in.</p><p>At a time when everyone is worried about the players’ workloads and mental welfare, club rugby has somehow ended up in a position where teams are going back and forth around the globe from one week to the next.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/dec/06/south-african-rugby-sets-sights-on-european-glory-champions-cup">Continue reading...</a>

Wife turned carer Sofia (Natalia Córdova-Buckley) stumbles across an uncanny canvas in the attic of the mansion to which she has brought her catatonic husband Alex (Ryan Kwanten); it is supposedly a self-portrait of his great-grandfather, but she is startled to find that it is a spitting image of Alex. While this gothic chestnut, and the psychodrama that follows – with Sofia unsure how much is the product of her own under-siege mind – feel familiar, Ross injects them with a troubling inner turbulence that bodes well for him.</p><p>Apparently a doting, endlessly patient spouse, Sofia hides a guilty secret: she was the one responsible f

Over the next year, British Gas sent numerous engineers to install a smart meter. All claimed they could not proceed as we were on the Economy 7 tariff. We weren’t. We then requested a standard meter instead, and were told we couldn’t have that either because asbestos was allegedly present.

Instead I began the long, hard road to a good education – and a brilliant career</p><p>As a child I wanted to be an actor, but things were difficult at home when I was growing up. I became a tearaway and, before I knew it, I was 16 and pregnant. My parents nearly had a heart attack. I’d done my GCSEs and wanted to do my A-levels. For support, I joined a local young mums’ group, but when I mentioned I wanted to keep studying, the midwife told me: “There’s no way you’ll be able to do it. If you want to go into education you should do a cooking course and then one day you’ll make a good wife to a divorcee.”</p><p>It really riled me up. It was like a red rag to a bull. I was like: that’s it, I’m doing this. That moment set me on my long journey into education. I got a flat for me and my daughter. I couldn’t afford the internet or a computer, but it was quiet and I was able to work without any drama. It

<p>This look at the Beatle’s shooting and the legal investigation does justice to a profoundly strange moment – thanks to incredible archive footage</p><p>If the fundamental measure of a documentary series is how many first-hand witnesses it can recruit, John Lennon: Murder Without a Trial is unimpeachable. This three-parter has almost everyone you could ask for, apart from Yoko Ono, as it reviews the day Lennon was shot dead by Mark Chapman, in New York on 8 December 1980, and the legal investigation that followed. What it can’t control is how much of interest those people have to say – because, however much we might expect the killing of a Beatle to be a fascinating story with a hive of secrets beneath the surface, this is a sad but simple tale.</p><p>By far the strongest episode of the three is the first, concerning the killing itself. Chapman shot Lennon after watching him leave the apartment block where he lived, the Dakota building overlooking Central Park, then waiting for him
