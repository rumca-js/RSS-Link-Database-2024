Dolly Daisy in Hearts and Flowers is simply an oddly unnerving, vexatious, and disturbing short that sits smack dab in the middle of a dreamscape one step away from being a nightmare. Love never looked so creepy.  Just a fun, weird little short to make you ponder just why all children's entertainment pre-Willy Wonka seemed to be designed to scare its intended audience.
