The new cash extends a Series C round that has now pulled in $43 million for the Seattle startup. Carbon Robotics has raised $80 million in total. The company declined to share details on what new product it&#8217;s developing, but said it&#8217;s not related to its flagship LaserWeeder machine, which uses thermal energy to eliminate weeds without damaging crops or disturbing soil. &#8220;Demand&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2023/carbon-robotics-raises-additional-8m-as-maker-of-ai-powered-weed-zapper-eyes-new-ag-tech-product/\">Read More</a>", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2023/carbon-robotics-raises-additional-8m-as-maker-of-ai-powered-weed-zapper-eyes-new-ag-tech-product", "date_published": "2023-12-06T17:22:24+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "GeekWire", "album": "GeekWire", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://www.geekwire.com/wp-content/themes/geekwire/dist/images/geekwire-logo-rss.png", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed/", "title": "GeekWire Gala FAQ: What to know if you\u2019re attending our big holiday party tonight in Seattle", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"709\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/geekwire-gala-recap-seattle-comm-1260x709.jpg\" width=\"1260\" /><br />We&#8217;re kicking off the holiday season in style tonight at our annual GeekWire Gala, with an epic night of dancing, networking, and much more on tap.

Airship AI, an under-the-radar tech startup that didn&#8217;t raise a single dime of investment, will soon become a publicly traded company after clearing SEC regulations this week for its SPAC deal. The Redmond, Wash.-based company traces its roots to 2003, when co-founders Victor Huang and Derek Xu took the startup leap together. They dabbled with different ideas, survived the recession, and landed on the current iteration of Airship AI in 2010. It&#8217;s been a long journey for the bootstrappers. &#8220;We are survivors,&#8221; Huang told GeekWire on Tuesday.

With the new AI model, the search giant is looking to jump ahead in the AI competition against OpenAI, Microsoft, Amazon, and other industry rivals. Google described Gemini as its largest and most capable model to date, and the first AI model to surpass human experts on the Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) benchmark.

The company, founded in 2021 by a trio of Seattle tech vets, is attempting to get ahead in its competion against corporate giants and an array startups in one of the most hotly contested AI fields.
