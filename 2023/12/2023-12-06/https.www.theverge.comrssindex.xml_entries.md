  <p id="yLBQBs">Gemini may be the biggest, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/23754507">most powerful large language model</a>, or LLM, Google has ever developed, but it’s better suited to running in data centers than on your phone. With Gemini Nano, though, the company is trying to split the difference: it built a reduced version of its flagship LLM that can run locally and offline on your device. Well, <em>a </em>device, anyway. The Pixel 8 Pro is the only Nano-compatible phone so far, but Google sees the new model as a core part o

  <p id="lUz21s">“Promptography” is what Berlin-based artist Boris Eldagsen calls his creative process. He inputs highly specific and deliberate text prompts into generative AI programs like DALL-E or Midjourney and tweaks their outputs repeatedly to create thought-provoking photographs — or at least, what <em>look</em> like photographs. His work is so convincing that he fooled Sony into giving him a photography award, only to decline the honor and reveal that his work was made using AI.</p>
