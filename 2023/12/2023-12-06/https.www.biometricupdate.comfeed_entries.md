		In Mashhad, Iran, facial recognition systems are being deployed to intimidate women into wearing hijabs, according to <a href="https://www.iranintl.com/en/202312052382">Iran International</a>.

On Monday, social editor for the city’s Khorasan newspaper, Vahid Tafrihi, brought the situation to light in an Instagram post that included a photo of one of the monitors that now displays the age and gender of subway passengers along with photos taken from CCTV surveillance.

“This is the Shariati Station of Line One of Mashhad Metro. The photo of all people who pass by CCTV cameras is shown together with age and gender information on large monitors. Can the municipality explain what it is seeking to achieve by this?” asked Tafrihi.

The age and gender on the monitors see

		A consumer watchdog is barking loudly at <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/clearview-ai">Clearview AI</a> and its facial recognition system, with a new letter to California’s Attorney General accusing the firm of operating “with callous disregard for the privacy rights of individual citizens” and representing “a clear and present danger to our societal norms and our privacy.” Clearview AI CEO Hoan Ton-That, however, says the allegations contain “numerous serious inaccuracies.”

In his <a href="https://consumerwatchdog.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Clearview-AI-Cover-Letter-and-Report.pdf">letter</a> and accompanying report, Consumer Watchdog Attorney Ryan Mellino cites a key provision in California’s Constitution, enacted by public vote in 197

Talks between EU members and lawmakers started on Wednesday afternoon and are still ongoing. Results are expected immenently.

Once it is reached, the provisional deal will pave the way for the final deal which should be reached before the end of the year, giving the AI Act a chance to become the law before European parliamentary elections in June. If the deal is not reached on time, however, the legislation is likely to be shelve

		A panel of digital ID community insiders yesterday told the U.S. Congress that the federal government has put the future of ID verification in the wrong hands.

Worse, those hands are waiting for standards from the International Standards Organization (ISO), an organization at least some of the speakers appeared to view with suspicion.

The four witnesses were testifying before a House of Representatives subcommittee on transportation on what verification process will follow when (and if) the Real ID standard for driver licenses is enforced by state and other governments.

It was clear in their <a href="https://homeland.house.gov/hearing/identity-management-innovation-looking-beyond-real-id/">testimony</a> that they feel the Congress is not taking the need for better IDs generally an

		Extensive data collection can now be assumed in most car models, as vehicles become what U.S. Senator Edward Markey calls, in a recent missive to automakers, “high-tech <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202304/major-carmakers-roll-out-new-biometric-features-including-stroke-detection">computers on wheels</a>” that “produce vast amounts of data on drivers, passengers, pedestrians, and other motorists, creating the potential for severe privacy violations.”

		Bhutan is amongst the poorest and least-developed countries in the world, ranked <a href="https://data.undp.org/countries-and-territories/BTN">134th out of 203</a> by the United Nations Development Programme. That may make it seem like an unlikely place to look for a digital ID system pioneering self-sovereign identity. But that is what Bhutan’s identity authority has developed.

Jacques Von Benecke, chief technology officer of Bhutan’s Druk Holding &amp; Investments (DHI), which runs the National Digital Identity (NDI) agency, tells <em>Biometric Update </em>in an interview that the country started working on SSI only about 2 years ago. The national digital identity credential is served from a digital wallet produced by the agency, and launched with the <a hr

		After years of debates, the European Union may finally be ready to begin collecting the biometrics of asylum seekers as young as six years old, a proposal that has elicited criticism not just from civil rights defenders but also agencies within the EU itself.

On Tuesday, the EU Presidency announced that a final political agreement on the question of childrens’ biometrics could be achieved as soon as Thursday. On that day, lawmakers will debate remaining issues, including data-retention periods and whether to include Ukrainian refugees in the system, the EU Observer <a href="https://euobserver.com/migration/157785">reports</a>.

		Nigeria’s digital ID, the National Identification Number (NIN), is increasingly getting solicited for different authentication use cases. Recently, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) announced that from March 1, 2024, all Tier-1 accounts will compulsorily have to be linked to either the biometric-based Bank Verification Number (BVN) or the NIN of the account owner. Relatedly, beneficiaries of a World Bank-sponsored agricultural program known as the Agro-Climatic Resilience in Semi-Arid Landscapes (ACReSAL), in the State of Niger, have been told that they must present their national ID card for verification before benefiting from program grants. These developments come just when the ID-issuing authority – the National Identity Management C
