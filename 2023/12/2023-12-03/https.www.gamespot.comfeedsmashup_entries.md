<p>It's starting to look very much like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/everything-new-in-fortnite-chapter-5-season-1/2900-4968/">Fortnite Chapter 5</a> could deliver one of the most-anticipated collaborations in Fortnite's history: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

He’ll make his debut on December 14.</p><p dir="ltr">The trailer shows off the sorcerer’s ability to summon portals to the NetherRealm and use them to his advantage, both through teleportation and special attacks. In one instance, we see a massive tentacle come through a portal and slam his opponent on the floor, while in another, Quan Chi himself jumps through a portal and lands on top of his foe.</p><div>          </div><p dir="ltr">The next Kameo fighter, Khameleon, is also featured in the video, and she uses a combination of moves from some of Mortal Kombat’s most famous femme fatales--Kitana, Mileena, and Jade--to help Quan Chi in battle. The trailer ends with a small glimpse at the next downloadable character, DC Comics’ Peacemaker, whose likeness and voice will be provided by J
