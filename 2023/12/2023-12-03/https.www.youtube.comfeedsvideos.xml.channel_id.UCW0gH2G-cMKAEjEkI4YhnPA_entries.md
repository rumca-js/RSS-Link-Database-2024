I wanted to share opening the 1 Million Subscriber YouTube Creator Award with you all. Thank you all SO MUCH for watching and subscribing to this channel!  It truly means the world to me that this nerdy passion of mine has reached so many people.  I love diving into Middle-earth with you all each and every week.  It is truly a dream job.  As we celebrate this milestone, I'm even more excited about what lies ahead...many more new and fun things in store!
