Keenan Allen came back from a thigh injury to catch five passes for 58 yards. But the only scoring the Chargers could manage was a pair of 38-yard field goals in the second quarter. New England made a quarterback switch, benching Mac Jones in favor of Bailey Zappe. But the Patriots (2-10) still lost their fifth straight game. For the first time in franchise history, the Patriots have been shut out at home twice in a season. Zappe was sacked five times – two by Khalil Mack, giving him a career-high 15 for the season and 99 in his career. Zappe was 13 for 25 for 141 yards; he did avoid an interception for the first time in three games, the previous two in relief of Jones.</p> <a href="https:/

In one direction lies the world they know: the family stress, the looming exams, the pumping pop beats at the club where they’ll reliably pull boys from school. In the other direction lies an uncertain path, and questions of who they are apart from one another, whether they could be the first in their families to go to university, and how to afford it if they do. Constantly on their minds, while they’re drunkenly dancing the nights away, is where they’ll end up, and what to do if they are the ones left behind.</p><p>Thoughtful if not revelatory, £1 Thursdays covers an uneasy period of big decisions in these characters’ lives, as the gap between them widens.

Chelsea’s manager must have felt as if he was in charge of a class of unruly toddlers during a performance that began in commanding fashion and ended with Thiago Silva making heroic blocks, Levi Colwill almost giving away a penalty in the 110<sup>th</sup> minute and a general air of chaos almost allowing Brighton to snatch an undeserved point.</p><p>If anything there were times when Chelsea were too intense as they chased only their fourth home win in the Premier League in 2023.

<p>Things do not always have to go perfectly to create perfection as Liverpool found out, maintaining their 100% home record in a seven-goal thriller against Fulham. Trent Alexander-Arnold, albeit via Bernd Leno’s back, and Alexis Mac Allister scored two incredible goals from a combined distance of 55 yards to twice put Liverpool into the lead. But Fulham repeatedly fought back, netting through Harry Wilson, Kenny Tete and Bobby De Cordova-Reid, all from close range, before Wataru Endo and Alexander-Arnold lifted Anfield into delirium.</p><p>It was rare that Alexander-Arnold was stationary on the pitch. He nominally started the game at right-back but could be found operating as a sweeper, in central midfield or at left wing. When he did get a moment of calm, the full-back lined up from 25 yards before curling in off the bar with the sweetest of strikes, although it will be slightly tainted as it hit Leno’s back on the way down.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/d

<p>Do you have an unexplained bruise? A bruise in an unlikely place? A bruise that seems to be getting worse rather than better? Here’s what might be going on – and what you should do about it</p><p>Bruises are most common at either end of life: in childhood because bumping into things is part of the rough-and-tumble of learning about the world; in old age because it becomes less avoidable. But for a few of us, bruises are a regular occurrence, perhaps because of diet, illness or a vigorous five-a-side schedule. But when do they go from inconvenience to alarm bell? And is there anything you can do to make yourself a bit less … peach-like?</p><p><br />To get the basics out of the way, a bruise is what happens when blood vessels get damaged, allowing blood to leak into the tissues under the skin. You can typically get an idea of how old (and close to healing) a bruise is by the colour: bruises are often red when they first appear, but within a day or two, the heme that gives blood its

Will its lethal wit survive?</p><p>Early next year, shooting starts for a sequel to the 1984 cult rock-mockumentary <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/18/spinal-tap-comedy" title="">This Is Spinal Tap</a></em>. It stars the actors who played the perma-delusional UK rockers back then: Michael McKean as hair-tossing frontman David St Hubbins; Christopher Guest as guitarist, Nigel “one louder” Tufnel; Harry Shearer as bassist Derek Smalls (“Hello, Cleveland!”). No drummers of course: they all perished, exploding on drum stools, dying in “freak gardening accidents”, and so on.</p><p><em>Spinal Tap II</em> has the same director, Rob Reiner, who also played interviewer Marty DiBergi in the original. Reiner has said the plot springs from the death of Spinal Tap’s harassed manager, Ian Faith, played by Tony Hendra, who himself died in 2021.

A frazzled, overworked dad, Bernard (Paapa Essiedu), disappoints his wife and daughter one too many times when he prioritises his extravagantly mean boss (Alan Cumming) at a Manhattan auction house over his family. His wife enforces a trial separation, which leaves Bernard staring down the barrel of the loneliest of Christmases.</p><p>But then, thanks to some fairly ropey CGI effects and a jewellery box of uncertain provenance, Bernard finds himself lumbered with a temporary roommate: a 2,000-year-old genie named Flora (Melissa McCarthy).

<p>A newly unearthed essay reveals the ambitious vision of the influential choreographer, teacher and innovator </p><p>He was one of the 20th century’s foremost pioneers of modern dance, bringing together communities with large-scale public performances. Now his previously unpublished writings reveal that Rudolf Laban’s ambitious vision for the art form extended to wanting to construct a theatre specifically designed for dance.</p><p>In an essay that has been unearthed some 65 years after his death, Laban wrote of his “dream” to stage dance in a “kilometre house” – a gigantic dome in the middle of the countryside, “a sort of oasis of movement for spectators and cast members alike” because existing theatres did not do justice to dance. He felt that audiences at the back of conventional theatres missed so much: “Even in a theatre in the shape of an amphitheatre, the spectators in the furthermost rows will be so far away from the stage that, although they will be able to get a good over

But then there’s Kojo, the almost too good to be true second-year student whom Malachi deepens his voice for, and immediately melts upon meeting. When he talks about Kojo, his whole body seems to shine with pleasure, Owusu’s lyrical language dancing on his tongue.

Chutneys and boozy fruits make sumptuous gifts for the Christmas chef<p>I am squirrelling away a growing collection of good things ready for Christmas. The plum pudding is already in its crackle-glazed china bowl; three or four jars of dark, brandy-spiked mincemeat and some pickled pears await the big day in the kitchen cupboard. Add to that this week’s large jars of dried apricots, plump and full of sweet wine and the row of tubby pots of chutney, thick with sweet fruit and spices, and I’m already starting to relax.</p><p>There is much to do in the kitchen over the coming weeks. A few delectable bits and pieces tucked away will be invaluable over Christmas and New Year. Chutneys to go with a pork pie or a plate of smoked salmon. Damson jam to go with Boxing Day ricotta cakes, hot from the frying pan, and a jar of mustard and honey dressing to ooze with the gravadlax I intend to make. Tiny things, but store cupboard treasures (a cook’s little lifesavers) for those of us responsible f

<p>Princess Kate is criticised for being enthusiastic in a new royal book, but using eagerness as a slur is silly and snobbish</p><p>Controversy raged last week over the issue of whether or not the Princess of Wales has regularly been called “Katie Keen”.

Her “pliable” and “coachable” approach to royal duties led, he writes, to the nickname “Katie Keen” becoming a “popular refrain on social media for several years”. Tuesday’s <em>Daily Mail</em> disputes this: “A search of social media last night… found no mention of the moniker before it appeared in the book.”</p><p>So what’s going on here then?

If you thought this was the gloomiest time of year to be outside, think again<p>The darker half of the year is a time that historically filled me with heavy dread. I loathed and even feared the ending of vibrant life and the boring melancholy that winter seemed to tow around with it. My mind has now been changed, not by the thoughtful persuasion of a human, but by gardens.</p><p>In the few gardens I have tended, while I’ve grown food, herbs and flowers in them, without my noticing they busied away, growing a new relationship with the world in me. There is now a peace that comes with the darkness, almost a relief, and the firm trust that winter makes way for the beauty of spring. The same cosy, calm acceptance that accompanies sleep comes to me as winter creeps in.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/dec/03/poppy-okotcha-how-my-garden-taught-me-to-love-winter">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Spurs and Manchester City managers face each other for the first time since a friendly set the Australian’s star on the rise</p><p>In a weird way it all began with a pre-season friendly. The sort of game that tends to wipe itself from the memory as soon as it’s finished, sometimes even earlier. A sweltering July night in the Tokyo outskirts. Yokohama F Marinos v Manchester City at the Nissan Stadium for an entirely made-up trophy called the EuroJapan Cup. But in retrospect, it is the moment when a convivial Australian coach called Ange Postecoglou begins his journey to the Premier League.</p><p>It’s 2019 and Postecoglou is halfway through his second season in Japan. His first, charitably put, was a mixed bag. There was a cup final but also one of the worst league finishes in the club’s history. There has been relentless attacking football and remorseless defensive collapses. A first relegation from the J-League has been narrowly avoided. But the top brass at Yokohama like the dire

It was a seductive concept, this season, these parties every night, where you would dash from your demanding office job (lawyer? Maybe a lawyer) to a bar, your dress glittering beneath a rotating mirrorball as you wound your way across the dancefloor, “CEEELEBRATE GOOD TIMES, COME ON!”, hand aloft as your friends cheered from the bar. At dawn, you would check your lipstick, dark red, still perfect, even after all the passionate illicit kissing by the cigarette machine and the next day you’d go again. Party season!</p><p>I’m older now. I’m older and I have lived some years, and while

Fresh out of rehearsals, they discuss PTSD, childhood ambition and what makes them angry</p><p>David Tennant and Cush Jumbo walk into the Donmar Warehouse’s offices, above the theatre’s rehearsal rooms in Covent Garden, and sit down on a sofa, side by side. Tennant has that look his many fans will instantly be able to call to mind of being at once stressed – with a desperado gleam in his eye – yet mischievously engaged, which has to do with the intelligence he applies to everything, the niceness he directs at everyone. He is wearing a mustard-coloured jersey and could be mistaken for someone who has been swotting in a library (actually, he has been rehearsing a fight scene). If I am right in supposing him to be tense at this mid-rehearsals moment, I know – from having interviewed him before – that it is not his way to put himself first, that he will crack on and probably, while he’s

<p>From Boris Johnson to Javier Milei, Geert Wilders and Donald Trump, sporting a wild and woolly barnet spells virility, charisma and populist appeal</p><p>Over the last decade, the global stage has become crowded with rightwing populist politicians seeking attention. It’s a development that has been subject to economic, social and historical analyses, but one aspect of this phenomenon has been neglected: the critical role of the haircut. The former Tory minister Rory Stewart acknowledged this fact last week on <em>The Rest is Politics</em> podcast when he declared: “Populism is all about hair.”</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/14/who-is-javier-milei-argentina-presidential-election-frontrunner" title="">Look at 53-year-old Javier Milei</a>, the soi-disant anarcho-capitalist who last month was voted president of Argentina, or 60-year-old Geert Wilders, the anti-immigrant leader of Holland’s Party for Freedom, which recently won the most votes in the Dutch gen

The singer on 10am mass, pasta for lunch and a game of chess<p><strong>Sunday morning…</strong> I usually wake up around 9am, then head straight out to mass, which starts at 10am. We live by the Tuscan coast in Forte dei Marmi, and our church is only round the corner, so I’ll often walk. Not attending isn’t an option – it’s the day of the Lord.</p><p><strong>And afterwards?</strong> I get back around midday, then we’ll have lunch as a family. We all follow a strict, healthy diet – even on a Sunday there’s nothing special being served. We are Italians, so there’s pasta, but now it’s made of ancient grains with less gluten. Then I’ll rest, and practise music – studying, singing and playing piano, as I do every day.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/dec/03/sunday-with-andrea-bocelli-i-only-do-what-i-enjoy-which-does-not-include-going-to-the-gym">Continue reading...</a>

Trimming £7.5m from programmes such as Newsnight endangers the corporation’s brief<p>Throughout the 100-year history of the BBC, a fierce debate has raged about how, in the words of its founder, John Reith, it should uphold its public service mission to “inform, educate and entertain”. To what extent should it focus on competing with commercial rivals for viewers – the viewers who, after all, pay for it through their licence fee? Or should it, instead, prioritise programming in the public interest that would not otherwise happen?</p><p>If there were ever an area where doggedly pursuing what’s not in the commercial interest of others should be front and centre of the BBC’s remit, it is news. At its best, public service news broadcasting is a vital part of the fourth estate, of a democracy where the powerful are held to account without fear or favour. But the BBC’s announcements last week about cuts to its news programming reveal its most senior executives do not attach enough value to

Then I didn’t. Part of that was me wanting to take some time after a bad breakup. But in trying to get back on that horse, nothing materialised. I’ve joined groups, I’ve gone out, I’ve engaged in activities that I enjoy, I’ve involved myself in my communities. I am friendly and approachable. I’m bright, well-educated, well-read, well-travelled. I have good self-esteem, a positive outlook and I’m told I’m very easy to talk to. These are things that people who know me well say about me.</em></p><p><em>But it’s now been 20 years since I’ve had a relationship. Trusted loved ones assure me I’m not doing anything wrong. The reason must be that I am unattractive and ugly. I was never a good-looking man, but I had youth on my side back then.</

White with fish, red with cheese… It’s with good reason that we pair certain foods and wines, but sometimes it pays to think a little differently<p><strong>Domaine des Deux Vallées ‘Clos du Petit Beaupréau’ Savennières, Loire, France 2020 (£22.99, or £19.99 as part of a mixed six, <a href="https://www.majestic.co.uk/">majestic.co.uk</a>) </strong>I know that there are plenty of people (serious wine lovers very much among them) who feel that thinking too hard about wine and food matching is a level of fuss and fussiness too much. But, without ever feeling the need to be too proscriptive or hectoring about it, I do think there’s rather a lot of fun to be had in seeking complementary combinations. Often, the best matches entail going against some of the more resilient “rules” of this part of the art of hospitality, such as the near-instinctive idea that the only colour of wine for cheese of all kinds is red. While it’s true there are some lovely darker-pigmented pairings (such as vintag

The restaurant’s setting, that frame, is potentially gorgeous. It’s a trio of ancient, brick-lined arched cellars dating back, as the name suggests, to the 17th century. By the door, scribbled up on a blackboard, is a timeline, detailing their construction in 1688. By the mid-19th century, they were home to a wine and spirits merchants called Richard Hinde &amp; Co who remained there until at least 1934. Intriguingly, it says the address was at the same time also the site of a temperance hotel. Presumably it occupied the building above, for those swearing off the booze stored

Her performance as Erin Quinn, one of four Catholic schoolgirls (and an English fella) living in Derry on the Northern Ireland border in the final throes of the Troubles, was – she now realised – quite out there: full of adolescent facial contortions that dripped with awkwardness, disdain and indignation.

But now she feared that she had blown her big break.</p><p>“I felt in a perpe
