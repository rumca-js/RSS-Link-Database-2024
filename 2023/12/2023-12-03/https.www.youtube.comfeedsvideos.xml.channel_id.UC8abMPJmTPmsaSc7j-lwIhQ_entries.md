Edison’s film company had been experimenting with sound since the very beginning and, while their sound system was not released before Gaumont’s, they were confident that it would soon dominate. The January 1913 unveiling of the Kinetophone was big news in the industry. 
The technology bellyflopped, losing its luster within weeks and a 1914 fire destroying the masters was the final nail in the coffin.
Jack's joke is one of the few surviving examples of the Kinetophone technology.
