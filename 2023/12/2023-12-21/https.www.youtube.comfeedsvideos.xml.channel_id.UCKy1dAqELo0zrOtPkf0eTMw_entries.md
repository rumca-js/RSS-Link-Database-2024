## Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom Review

Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom reviewed by Amelia Emberwing.

When Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom is being an Aquaman story and leaning into the silliness and family aspects of it all, it’s fun. The enjoyable bits are just sandwiched between some ugly effects and a weird first act that feel cobbled together from a very different movie. The relationship between Orm and Arthur – and the rapport between Jason Mamoa and Patrick Wilson – helps buoy the story and is unquestioningly the best part; it’s a shame that the dawn of James Gunn’s DC Cinematic Universe means we’ll probably never see them again.

## Fortnite Rocket Racing Review

Fortnite Rocket Racing reviewed by Gabriel Moss on PC, Xbox Series X, and Nintendo Switch, also available on Android and PlayStation 5.

"Fortnite Rocket Racing is certainly worth a few rounds if you’re already into either Fortnite or arcadey racers, though it doesn’t yet have enough going for it to permanently attract anyone away from other beloved multiplayer games like Rocket League or Mario Kart. Still, its brief races are speedy enough to keep you entertained between other activities, and it's simple and easy to get online buddies playing together across platforms – even though its underdeveloped racing mechanics, lack of content, and absence of local multiplayer mean it struggles to stay fresh for too long."

In today's Daily Fix:
Despite being the victim of one of the worst data breaches in games industry history, Sony received some positive news today. Reuters is reporting that the PlayStation 5 is on track to outpace the PS4 in sales, with more than 50 million PS5's sold since 2020. By comparison, the PS4 has sold about 114 million units since 2013. The PS5 is also outselling its competitor, the Xbox Series X and Series S family, by a comfortable margin. In other news, Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick has formally announced his departure form the company, effective at the end of the year.
