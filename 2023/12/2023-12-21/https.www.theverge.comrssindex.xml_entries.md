  <p id="d42iB5">SiriusXM is getting sued by the state of New York for making it too difficult for subscribers to cancel their plans. The suit claims that customers who want to cancel are required to chat over the phone or online with an agent who bombards them with questions and offers. “Sirius deliberately wastes its subscribers’ time even though it has the ability to process cancellations with the click of a button,” <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/court-filings/sirius-petition.pdf">the suit</a> reads.</p>
<p id="K4YWbM">Attorney General Letitia James’ office claims that SiriusXM’s own data reveals that it takes subscribers an average of 11.5 minutes to cancel

  <p id="Th4mhL">A lot happened in the headphone world this year. 2023 gave us the usual serving of big new products, but it also continued that story of earbuds and headphones growing smarter and more advanced — while audio quality keeps reaching new heights. And for better or worse, the trend helped to strengthen ecosystem lock-in for brands like Apple, Samsung, and Google.</p>

  <p id="30ic0z">If rumors are to be believed, we’re less than a month away from the launch of Samsung’s latest flagship smartphones, the Galaxy S24 range. Over on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, leaker Evan Blass has shared what appears to be <a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1737637446089949533">an early look at a countdown to the next Galaxy Unpacked</a> that says “Galaxy AI is coming” on January 18th at 3AM KST.

  <p id="qOcvL6">Elon Musk’s X platform, previously known as Twitter, has mostly stopped working for more than an hour. Many people are reporting they can’t see anything on their timelines. In mobile apps, the timelines won’t refresh, and on the web, there’s a placeholder message proclaiming, “Welcome to X! This is the best place to see what’s happening in your world. Find some people and topics to follow now.”</p>
<p id="nIEaz6">Oddly, posting to the site still works, even if the posts disappear after a refresh, and accounts followed with notifications turned on still appear in that feed and push notifications for new posts. There’s even <a href="https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1kvKpvwnDM
