I am bad at vision, period &#8211; I'm astigmatic, shortsighted, color blind, and often miss visual details others see. I can't even draw a stick-figure.

But despite my vast visual deficits, I thoroughly enjoy making collages for this blog. For many years now &#8211; decades &#8211; I've been illustrating my blog posts by mixing public domain and Creative Commons art with work that I can make a good fair use case for.
