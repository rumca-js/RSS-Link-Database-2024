Despite celebrating 100 years of existence, Disney has had kind of a rough year, with several flops like The Marvels, Indiana Jones, and a lot of stuff on Disney+. Can Wish, the movie billed as a Disney celebration break the losing streak? No, no it cannot.


Wish definitely raises some questions. Like is the King really that evil to not grant every wish? Why is he even taking all their wishes? What’s the purpose of that talking goat anyway? How much of this movie’s budget did they think they’d make back on Star merch?


To answer all these questions, check out the pitch meeting that led to Wish!
