CCP has a long history of aggressive expansion throughout the Indo-Pacific region, including the construction of artificial islands as military installations and attempts to force other countries in the region to relinquish their sovereignty and territory. It claims historical sovereignty over much of the South China Sea, while a number of other countries, including the Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Brunei, are also lodging claims in the region.
