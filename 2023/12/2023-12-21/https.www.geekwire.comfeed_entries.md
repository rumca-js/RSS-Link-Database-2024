Bird filed for bankruptcy on Wednesday, saying in a news release that the &#8220;financial restructuring process&#8221; is aimed at &#8220;strengthening its balance sheet and better positioning the company for long-term, sustainable growth.&#8221; Bird first received a permit to operate electric scooters in the city in 2022.
