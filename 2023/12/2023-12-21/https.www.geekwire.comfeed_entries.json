But if that information is inaccessible, of poor quality, or people don&#8217;t know how to analyze it, it can&#8217;t do much good. To address this issue, Mayor Bruce Harrell recently issued the One Seattle Data Strategy, a comprehensive plan to optimize the city&#8217;s use of data to inform decision making, improve collaboration, protect privacy, foster public access, and standardize best practices across departments. To highlight the importance of open data, the city last week hosted a public hackathon in which participants used currently&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2023/seattle-aims-to-unleash-the-power-of-open-data-through-hackathon-and-new-city-strategy/\">Read More", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2023/seattle-aims-to-unleash-the-power-of-open-data-through-hackathon-and-new-city-strategy", "date_published": "2023-12-21T18:44:44+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "GeekWire", "album": "GeekWire", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://www.geekwire.com/wp-content/themes/geekwire/dist/images/geekwire-logo-rss.png", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed/", "title": "India set to open new consulate in Seattle area, with a focus on tech industry", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"945\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/IMG_9866-1260x945.jpeg\" width=\"1260\" /><br />Seattle&#8217;s tech industry could get a boost from the new consulate of India set to open soon.

Bird filed for bankruptcy on Wednesday, saying in a news release that the &#8220;financial restructuring process&#8221; is aimed at &#8220;strengthening its balance sheet and better positioning the company for long-term, sustainable growth.&#8221; Bird first received a permit to operate electric scooters in the city in 2022.
