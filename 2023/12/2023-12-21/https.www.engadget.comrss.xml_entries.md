## The Apple Watch ban is here: Why Apple is no longer selling the Watch Series 9 and Watch Ultra

<p>You can't buy the Apple Watch Series 9 and the Ultra 2 from Apple's online store anymore — and after December 24, they'll also no longer be available from the company's retail outlets. Here's why.</p>
<h2>Why is there an Apple Watch ban?</h2>
<p>Apple has pulled the watch models from its website after the United States International Trade Commission (ITC) <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-will-pause-watch-series-9-and-ultra-2-sales-in-the-us-due-to-a-patent-dispute-142051903.html?src=rss">ordered the company</a> to stop selling them in the US.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The ITC issued the Apple Watch ban after siding with Masimo, a medical technology company, which sued Apple in 2021 for allegedly infringing on five patents related to light-based blood oxygen monitoring. In October, the ITC upheld a judge's ruling from earlier this year that the Apple Watch did violate Masimo's patents.Both the affected models come with the feature, but older models with th

<p>At its heart, <em>Squid Game</em> <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflixs-squid-game-the-challenge-trailer-confirms-it-missed-the-message-185144569.html">is a critique of capitalism</a> and yet, Netflix can’t stop finding ways to squeeze money from it.

The web browser’s latest version (M12) upgrades <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chrome-ios-android-security-update-174406364.html">Safety Check</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-chrome-memory-saver-battery-saver-170334721.html">Memory Saver</a> while adding the ability to save tab groups.</p>
<p>Safety Check is Chrome’s security hub that checks for updates and compromised passwords and displays whether Safe Browsing is turned on. With the browser’s latest version, Safety Check becomes more proactive, running automatically in the background. “You’ll get proactively alerted if passwords saved in Chrome have been compromised, any of your extensions are potentially harmful, you’re not using the latest version of Chrome, or site permissions need your attention,” Chrome Group Product Manager Sabine Borsay wrote in an announcement post. The feature will provide alerts at the top of Chrome’s three-dot menu.</

<p>Windows Mixed Reality is heading to a farm upstate. Microsoft is shutting down the platform, according to an <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/whats-new/deprecated-features">official list of deprecated</a> Windows features. This includes the garden variety Windows Mixed Reality software, along with the Mixed Reality Portal app and the affiliated Steam VR app. The platform isn’t gone yet, but Microsoft says it’ll be “removed in a future release of Windows.”</p>
<p>Microsoft first unveiled Windows Mixed Reality back in 2017 as its attempt to compete with rivals in the VR space, like HTC and Oculus (which is now owned by Meta.) We were <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-05-12-microsoft-hololens-mixed-reality.html">fascinated by the tech</a> when it first launched, as it offered the ability for in-person shared mixed reality.

<p>Online multiplayer is part and parcel of many video games these days, but finding something you can play on the couch with friends and family is tougher. If you’re looking for some local co-op fun, allow us to help. Below are 26 of the best couch co-op games we’ve played across the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S and PC. Note that we’re focusing on genuine co-op experiences, not games that have local multiplayer but aren’t truly cooperative in practice. So, no <em>Mario Kart</em> or <em>Jackbox</em>. Nevertheless, our list encompasses everything from platformers and puzzlers to RPGs and arcade shooters.</p>

Refract is a unison-based effect that stacks voices to create unique soundscapes, which could be a boon for sound designers or just anyone looking to add a bit of textural pizazz to their tracks.</p>
<p>This is a multi-fx plugin, so the unison effect can be leveraged to create a number of different Mode FX algorithms. It can duplicate a signal up to eight times, each getting its own stereo voice. This allows for movement between “unfiltered stems to a wide and powerful sound.” Arturia says each of the integrated effects can be combined to create “a dispersion pathway that fits your wildest imaginations.” We’ll see about that.</p>

<p>It’s been a busy year for spaceflight — the busiest ever, in fact. This fall, space companies once again broke the record for successful orbital launches in a single year with 2023’s 180th flight — Starlink satellites sent up by SpaceX on November 22, according to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2023/11/2023-has-been-another-year-with-a-record-number-of-orbital-launches/#:~:text=In%202005%2C%20only%2052%20rockets,by%20the%20end%20of%20December."><em>Ars Technica</em></a>.

<p>That pace has been driven in no small part by Elon Musk’s aerospace venture, which set a goal of hitting 100 launches in 2023 and is nearly there, with <a href="https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2023/12/launch-roundup-120923/#:~:text=SpaceX's%2092nd%20launch%20of%202023,SpaceX's%20125th%20operational%20Starlink%20mission.">92 as of December 7</a>.

<p>It's been an interesting few years for Huawei. After the Chinese giant's initial struggle with the US trade sanctions, it would end up with a surprise mobile resurgence featuring homegrown processors — ones that are just two generations behind the competition. Not only that, the Chinese government has since allocated billions of dollars to boost its silicon industry, so much that Huawei is already working towards a self-sufficient chip network. It's as if former President Donald Trump's earlier attempts to starve Huawei of vital inputs eventually accelerated China's semiconductor development.</p>
<p>Trump's first strike on Huawei was the declaration of a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-15-president-trump-national-emergency-for-telecom-networks.html">national emergency</a> in May 2019, which saw the Commerce Department add the company to its <a href="https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/policy-guidance/lists-of-parties-of-concern/entity-list">Entity List</a>, citing surveill

It has designated Pornhub, Stripchat and XVideos as “very large online platforms” (VLOPs) after determining they each have an average of more than 45 million monthly users in the EU. This means they will face the same rules as Facebook, X, and TikTok. (Is the discourse in comments really worse than parts of X?
