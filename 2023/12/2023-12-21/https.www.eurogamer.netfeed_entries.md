If you find yourself thinking, "you know what, I feel more like grazing a big Sm&ouml;rg&aring;sbord of culinary delights rather than taking on a herd of Grazers with Aloy right now", then I have good news. There is an official Horizon cookery book in the works. 
</p><p>
Known as Tastes of the Seven Tribes, this book will allow you to whip up a batch of spicy Fireclaw stew or even some Bitterbrew Boar (which is described as "mouth-watering"). 
</p><p>
It's coming from Insight Editions, Rick Barba and prolific recipe writer Victoria Rosenthal, whose name you may recognise from a myriad of other video game related cookery books such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cook-up-a-storm-worthy-of-thor-with-the-god-of-war-recipe-book-available-now">God of War's Official Cookbook of the Nine Realms</a> and the <a href="https://www.eurogam

Super Mario Run, Nintendo's first mobile game to feature its moustachioed mascot, has been updated with a tie-in to recent Switch game Super Bros. Mario Wonder.
</p><p>
The smartphone app now lets you activate Wonder Flowers during levels in the game's Toad Rally mode, as part of a special event that runs until 14th March 2024.
</p><p>
What happens in Super Mario Run when you activate a Wonder Flower? Well, you can see the process in the video below.

You might have noticed I recorded - and wrote - a whole <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-a-plague-tale-came-back-from-the-brink">Making Of A Plague Tale</a> feature earlier this year. Well, I also spoke to the standout star of it - Charlotte McBurney - who plays Amicia in the game. We spoke shortly before she found out whether she'd won the Performer in a Lead Role BAFTA, which sadly she didn't - Kratos' Christopher Judge did. Nor did I manage to publish our conversation, because this year has been very busy. But now there's a bit of quiet, I'm returning to it, to release it as something of a Christmas gift.</p><p>Charlotte McBurney has had an incredible rise to fame. She was only 16 when she was cast in the first A Plague Tale game, Innocence, during the mi

If there are some games you would rather your friends and family didn't know you were playing, for whatever reason that may be, Steam has your back.
</p><p>
As part of its recent Steam Client Beta update, Valve has added the ability for players to mark certain games as private. How handy!
</p><p>
"Starting today you'll be able to mark specific games as private and they'll disappear from anywhere they'd be viewed by someone other than you," it wrote on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/3901870709962551195">Steam</a>. </p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/you-can-now-hide-your-steam-games-from-public-view">Read more</a></p>

Rocksteady has now confirmed the return of iconic DC Comics character Poison Ivy in Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League.
</p><p>
The character - now just named Ivy - returns in Suicide Squad with a radically changed appearance following her apparent demise in 2015's Arkham Knight. (As a reminder, Suicide Squad is a canonical follow-up to the Arkham series, also developed by Rocksteady).
</p><p>
Rocksteady debuted Ivy's new appearance via an extended look at the character in a fresh developer diary, which you can watch below.

Can you believe it, but it is nearly the end of 2023. We made it guys! While many of us will likely be setting our sights on a bottle of Baileys and novelty Christmas pudding shaped confectionery, Bethesda is still all business, and has laid out its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-guides-tips-tricks-9352">Starfield</a> plans for 2024.

Come, take a flick through World of Horror's rolodex of nightmares; see faces flayed by vengeful wives, wild-eyed teachers with rictus grins, soul-bartering telemarketers, trypophobia-inducing latticework rendered across human skin, and other lurid things.

It is 198X and the world is on the cusp of a technological revolution (and Eldritch annihilation, but we'll get to that), caught between the superstitions of the old world and the suspicions of the new; a place where diabolical rituals are still performed by the light of the moon, while Bulletin Board Systems send murderous dial-up messages from beyond the veil. It's also a world immediately indebted, both visually and tonally, to manga horror master Junji Ito, whose stories of everyday mundanity succumbing to the grotesque here shape countless original h
