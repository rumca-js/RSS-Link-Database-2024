<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/forspoken/">Forspoken</a> got off to a rough start even before the game launched back in February. Certain <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/that-awful-forspoken-ad-reflects-the-all-consuming-jossification-of-video-games/1100-6506544/">early trailers</a> featured a few awkward, out-of-context lines from the protagonist, Frey Holland. Those became a major talking point online, drawing attention away from what the focus should have been on: the terrific parkour.</p><p dir="ltr">Forspoken could never quite shake that initial negative impression, but despite what the internet would lead you to believe, the game deserves a lot more praise than it received, especially when it comes to its unique, magical movement.</p><p dir="ltr">Frey gets transported to a fantasy world shortly after the story begins, and once tutorials end, the land of Athia is yours to explore. The map is much larger than you'd expect, and Frey has nothing but shoes on

<p><h2>These movies made the most money at the box office this year</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1179/11799911/4232720-screenshot2023-12-08at2.19.38pm.png" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">2023 is winding down, so we're looking back at the biggest movies of the year. This was a year dominated at the box office by Disney, Marvel, Mario, and Barbie. One of the most notable events this year came in July when the tonally distinct movies Barbie and Oppenheimer released on the same day, sparking the "Barbenheimer" phenomenon that became a meme.</p><p dir="ltr">Both movies performed exceptionally well, with Greta Gerwig's Barbie expected to finish 2023 as the year's highest-grossing movie globally with more than $1.4 billion. Oppenheimer did great as well, collecting more than $950 million in box office receipts to become director Christopher Nolan's highest-grossing non-Batman movie in his entire career.</p><p dir="ltr">The Super Mario Bros. Movie also made a splash

## Aquaman And The Lost Kingdom Review - A Better Ending Than The DCEU Deserves

<p dir="ltr">Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom is a movie that looks like it has a lot of baggage, what with it being the last film in DC movieverse that launched with Zack Snyder's Man of Steel, conflicting reports about which Batman would show up, rumors that Amber Heard's relationship drama with Johnny Depp ended up sidelining her, and so on.</p><p dir="ltr">But it's been much ado about nothing, really. This Aquaman flick works as a direct sequel to the first movie and doesn't bother with the greater franchise at all--why would it, when there's nothing left to tease? Naturally, that means there's no Batman in this movie. And the rumors about Amber Heard's Mera being sidelined were just wrong, because she's in it plenty and has several major heroic moments in the third act.</p><p dir="ltr">All of that stuff was just noise. As a new mega-budget action-adventure flick from one of the very best filmmakers working today, Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom rules.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.c

## Barbie Is GameSpot's Movie Of The Year 2023

<p dir="ltr">As we reach the end of 2023, it's hard to argue anything made a bigger pop culture impact than Barbie. What would have been an emotionally empty cash grab about the world's most popular doll turned out to be a reason for moviegoers to celebrate the evolution of said doll franchise from merely a toy to a symbol of strength, individualism, and accepting yourself.</p><p dir="ltr">While on the surface, Barbie was a flashy and fun romp, with Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling acting cute and goofy around each other while wearing bright clothes, it was about so much more. After spending their entire existence thinking their simple and idyllic way of life had influenced the world, Barbie (Robbie) realized just how bleak reality can be. This is a film that takes aim at toxic masculinity, corporate America, and everyone who tries to minimize your very existence, all through the eyes of a Barbie doll.</p><p dir="ltr">With the strength of Robbie's and Gosling's performances, along with

## 2023 May Go Down As The Best Year Ever For Horror Games

<p dir="ltr">As 2023 winds to a close, one of the most common refrains from those in and around the video game industry is how this year was one for the history books, and gave us one of the very best game release calendars we've ever seen. While this is true regardless of genre, with highly anticipated sequels like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/baldurs-gate-3/">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marvels-spider-man-2/">Marvel's Spider-Man 2</a> being some of this year’s best-reviewed games on Metacritic, it's especially true for horror games.</p><p dir="ltr">It wasn't that long ago that horror fans didn't have a lot to get excited about--I recall the Xbox 360/PS3 era being particularly barren, with only a few notable exceptions. But as major studios learn to make the age of high-fidelity gaming work for the genre and

In addition to some quality work from big franchises like Saw and Scream, the indie horror scene has been a goldmine full of great horror that never got a significant theatrical release--or any theatrical release at all in a bunch of cases.</p><p dir="ltr">Let's celebrate the year in horror by looking at the top-rated horror films by Metacritic score. Metacritic, which is GameSpot's sister site, aggregates reviews of movies, TV shows, video games, and other media with a weighted average of the individual review scores. Anything that was released in the United States for the first time in 2023, in theaters or on streaming, qualifies, and so it's not the big titles that dominate this list. Let's take a look.
