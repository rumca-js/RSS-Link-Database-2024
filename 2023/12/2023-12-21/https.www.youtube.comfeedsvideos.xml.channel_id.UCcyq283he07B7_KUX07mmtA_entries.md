Military training instructors are responsible for training new recruits at the United States Air Force's 7 Â½-week basic military training. But before they're certified to train new recruits in boot camp, they must graduate from the eight-week military training instructor school. Business Insider spent four days with future MTIs as they relearned military basics, trained their command voice, and met the physical qualifications to don the iconic campaign cover and prepare the next generation of airmen.
