<p>The last time a Crystal Palace manager lost to Brighton it cost him his job so Roy Hodgson could have had no illusions about the importance of this match. But having looked like being able to celebrate the end of their winless run courtesy of Jordan Ayew’s goal, the substitute Danny Welbeck’s equaliser eight minutes from time ensured that Hodgson’s future remains very much in the balance.</p><p>A committed performance against Roberto De Zerbi’s side should mean that Hodgson won’t suffer the same fate as Patrick Vieira – who was sacked in a 7am phone call with the chairman, Steve Parish, as he drove to the training ground – just yet, even if games against Chelsea and Brentford after Christmas now look crucial with the former Nottingham Forest manager Steve Cooper lurking in the background.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/dec/21/crystal-palace-brighton-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

It is a boat so gorgeous that TV’s last lovely houseboat, the one in Copenhagen from season two of The Bear, must be jealous of its fixtures and fittings. Does she have a lot of Dutch friends?

Just settle in – sink in, might be even better – and enjoy the velvety loveliness.</p><p>Nobody does description like Nigella. This is what makes her cookbooks such a pleasure to read.

The initial 95 miles of the Tunnel Hill 100 footrace had unfolded with the swiftness of a fleeting breeze. Brisk, beautiful miles under a collage of crisp autumn foliage. The 80-year-old hadn’t fallen once. But the last five miles presented a particular problem. They were all downhill.</p><p>He couldn’t feel it, but he could see it – his upper body drooping like a glove without a hand – his hunched shadow sinking into itself until he finally dove into the soft grass. Little is known about “the leans”, a temporary but debilitating condition that can crop up in older ultrarunners. The phenomenon is oft observed but poorly understood.

<p>A fascinating celebration of how ice has shaped human existence</p><p>In 1946 a young atmospheric scientist named Bernard Vonnegut made a significant discovery. It had already been shown that clouds could be made to produce snow or rain by “seeding” them with dry ice, but Vonnegut proved that an even more dramatic and persistent effect could be achieved with silver iodide. The following year, he encouraged his struggling younger brother to join the same lab, not as a scientist but as a copywriter. It was almost 20 years later that Kurt Vonnegut published his satirical novel <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/nov/11/cats-cradle-kurt-vonnegut-novels-everyone-should-read">Cat’s Cradle</a>, inspired by what he’d seen, in which a tyrant unleashes a synthetic form of ice (“ice-nine”) that causes any water it touches to freeze instantly. The novel does not end happily for the planet or its inhabitants.</p><p>Ranging from the last ice age to the Anthropocene, Max Leonard’s be

<p>The star is an absolute firebrand who’s gone from radical theatre to narrating adorable festive special Mog’s Christmas. She talks socialism, ballet and why she hated student drama</p><p>Judith Kerr’s Mog is not an especially Christmassy creation: she’s a pesky cat, the colour of a 70s puddle, the centre of a loving family where the mum looks like she spends a lot of time sighing.</p><p>Nonetheless, Mog did have a Christmas adventure, published 1976, so why shouldn’t Channel 4 animate it for their seasonal offering? There can’t be anyone in the country who didn’t either read it to their kids or have it read to them. As soon as you start watching, you settle into the nostalgia like a warm bath. The narrator’s tone has a lot of life in it, along with gentle, absolute authority. It doesn’t send you to sleep, but lets you know it is safe to do so. In short, Adjoa Andoh, 60, is perfect. “I’ve been doing audiobooks since they were still recorded on cassette,” she tells me. “People have

It’s very rewarding.<br /><strong>Todd Field:</strong> Yesterday, a woman came up and talked to me about the movie for maybe 25 minutes. She had seen it nine times.<br /><strong>CB:</strong> We all have our rapid-fire set of judgments when things first come out. I think people were quick to define what the film was, but the way it’s distilled has been really interesting. Todd’s made a great film that stands the test of time.

<p>Nuno’s tricky first Forest task, a test of title credentials at Anfield and Bernd Leno on fire for Fulham</p><p>After the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/dec/20/steve-cooper-nuno-espirito-santo-nottingham-forest">departure of Steve Cooper from Forest</a>, there is an interesting potential candidate available for the next vacant Premier League job. Crystal Palace are known admirers of Cooper, while Roy Hodgson has tasted victory once in his past 10 matches – and that was away at Burnley. The positivity of securing a late draw at the Etihad after coming back from two goals down will be a boon for Palace’s manager but this needs to be built on and a home “derby” is a good place to do it, if he does not want his job to be under threat. Brighton are wicked opponents for a team in trouble but when a crisis arrives it is sensible to attack it head on. Victory will make many of Hodgson’s problems go away, otherwise the shadow of Cooper may start looming over him. <stron

<p>I was waiting with some friends to get chips when the first blow landed. Then came another. I ran off and soon signed up for a muay thai class</p><p>The worst thing about being punched in the face by a stranger on Christmas Day wasn’t that it happened twice: it was that, the second time, my friends accidentally helped him out. It was after Christmas Eve drinks at 2am when the punch landed, and I’m still not clear what I did to provoke it – the best my assailant could offer, as I stood there confused with an aching jaw, was that I had been “in there, giving it all that”. Possibly I’d been dancing over-enthusiastically to the Divine Comedy’s Gin Soaked Boy, which my local nightclub, The Gallery, loved using as a closer around Christmas 1999. Maybe it was something else. For me, there was no warning: one second I was waiting for my friends to get their post-club chips, the next, I was asking a man why he’d just hit me in the face. It didn’t calm him down <em>at all.</em></p><p>Then,

<p>Opt for brown bread – crusts and all – over traditional wasteful white for a flavourful and nutritious Christmas bread sauce </p><p>I love bread sauce with my Christmas dinner, but many recipes are wasteful and outdated. Most call for fresh white breadcrumbs, made without the crusts, as well as a clove-studded onion that’s infused with milk and then thrown in the bin. Why, I have no clue. Save time and waste, and embrace the beige: use brown bread, keep the crusts on (even bread ends work here) and add a little grated onion instead of using and chucking a whole one. Your brown bread sauce will be more nutritious and flavourful for it. Even if you’re a staunch traditionalist and insist on using a whole onion, after lifting it from the milk, remove the cloves, cut the onion in half and roast it alongside your other Christmas veg, or use it as a trivet on which to roast the meat (at the very least it will give your gravy a great head start), or save it and put in a Boxing Day stew.</
