Nominated for the 2022 Mercury Prize for their debut album The Overload, it’s been a whirlwind for Yard Act ever since the world began reopening. The band’s earlier forays into North America had been primarily restricted to the coasts, but September of 2023 saw the band carve a slice across the American Midwest, with shows in Minneapolis; Madison, Wisconsin; and Chicago. During Yard Act’s visit to Minnesota, they visited The Current for a studio session hosted by Jill Riley.

Here they are performing one of their latest singles, "Land of the Blind," in The Current studio.
