The weekend before Christmas is the busiest shopping weekend. Black Friday is for sales on electronics. The weekend before Christmas is for procrastinators. And if being on the road shopping makes you coo-coo for cocoa puffs, assume the person next to you is worse. You can avoid getting into both a car accident and a street fight, as you are about to see in one of the most Long Island bits of content I've ever seen. We'll call this Road Rager '23: Xmas Xaos.</p><p>The video misses the accident. We start with an overturned truck and someone armed with what appeared to be a kendo stick. I think the sideways car is his because a friend runs from being the car also armed with what appears to be a kendo stick. Odd choice of weaponry for the South Shore. Maybe they're wrestlers

If we acted up, we were told Santa put us on the naughty list and that we weren't getting any presents. The payoff was that as we got older, we were allowed to then torture our kids in the same way. </p><p>Or you're someone like Uncle Brodigan who, when his nieces and nephew are told Santa thinks they're bad, calls Santa himself and says it's all Fake News.</p><p>This little kid was NOT having it when he was told he was on the naughty list. And then he issued threats. I'm fairly certain this is not a new video. But it's the first I've seen it, and I can't stop laughing.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
