This goes for every conversation with just about everyone. That would suck. It would not make you want to talk to anyone while working because you would just be swamped with paperwork for every little thing you said. It would probably make you quit that job. </p><p>Now imagine a major city with this exact policy in place for its entire police force. That is what is happening to the NYPD. </p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\"></div> \u2014  (@)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nypost/status/1737596821759820012\"></a>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://nypost.com/2023/12/20/metro/nyc-council-approves-bill-forcing-cops-to-record-all-encounters-bans-solitary-confinement/\" rel=", "link": "https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/nyc-police-bill", "date_published": "2023-12-21T22:46:19+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "Louder With Crowder", "album": "Louder With Crowder", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yMzE1NTQ3MS9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1MjE1Njc1MH0.cVUGcJzdyyjj3xKR7tPeQKtnP3_3j0yJ-3yt3wA91m8/image.png?width=210", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://louderwithcrowder.com/feed/", "title": "Teen Shot During Seattle's CHAZ-BLM \"Autonomous Zone\" Is Now Suing The City", "description": "<img src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=50903439&amp;width=1245&amp;height=700&amp;coordinates=51%2C0%2C52%2C0\" /><br /><br /><p>Remember the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/chaz-seattle-farming\" target=\"_blank\">Summer of Love</a>,\u201d where a bunch of unshowered, Marixts idiots took over an area of Seattle because of racism or something? </p><p>Well, it turns out that when these weirdos were fighting racism, they ended up shooting a black teen.

I am sure they would rather do just about anything but that. But what I don\u2019t get is why a 13-year-old would threaten to shoot up a synagogue. And what I don\u2019t get even more is the lack of punishment for those evil threats. It does not take a genius to know that shooting at anyone, let alone a synagogue, is bad. Heck, even a four-year-old knows not to shoot up a school.</p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em ", "link": "https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/synagogue-book-report", "date_published": "2023-12-21T22:39:49+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "Louder With Crowder", "album": "Louder With Crowder", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yMzE1NTQ3MS9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1MjE1Njc1MH0.cVUGcJzdyyjj3xKR7tPeQKtnP3_3j0yJ-3yt3wA91m8/image.png?width=210", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}]
