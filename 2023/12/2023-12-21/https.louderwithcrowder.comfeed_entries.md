This goes for every conversation with just about everyone. That would suck. It would not make you want to talk to anyone while working because you would just be swamped with paperwork for every little thing you said. It would probably make you quit that job. </p><p>Now imagine a major city with this exact policy in place for its entire police force. That is what is happening to the NYPD. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

So I guess the Summer of Love did not end white supremacy as it was intended. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

</p><p>I get that the last thing a 13-year-old boy wants to be doing is writing a book report about World War II. I am sure they would rather do just about anything but that. But what I don’t get is why a 13-year-old would threaten to shoot up a synagogue. And what I don’t get even more is the lack of punishment for those evil threats. It does not take a genius to know that shooting at anyone, let alone a synagogue, is bad. Heck, even a four-year-old knows not to shoot up a school.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
