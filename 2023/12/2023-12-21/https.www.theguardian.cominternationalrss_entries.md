Mash the two together and you get the very untraditional and delicious eggnog tiramisu. Many tiramisu recipes fold whipped egg whites through mascarpone to create a mousse-like texture, but I prefer the mascarpone to be rich and unctuous, so I leave out the egg whites and make small individual portions. They are quite rich, though – as any self-respecting Christmas dessert ought to be.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/dec/21/eggnog-tiramisu-recipe-edd-kimber">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Edin Terzić’s stuttering side dropped more points against opponents who denied them last season’s Bundesliga</p><p>Not them again, already. Mainz already defined Borussia Dortmund’s 2023 once and now, as the year winds down in deflating fashion in Westfalen, they might be in danger of doing so again. Sunday’s traditional Christmas gathering at Signal Iduna Park, with carols and spectacle in front of a 73,056 crowd, may have meant a moratorium on grumbles and concerns for a team that has gone from touching distance of history to sleepwalking through winter. Yet 48 hours later at the same venue the worries were back in triplicate.</p><p>“It’s just not working at the moment,” said the captain, Emre Can, after more dropped points on Tuesday, and there could be no arguing with it after Dortmund extended their current Bundesliga run to just one win in eight - and no wins in the last four.

That’s a familiar axiom of American life, and it’s often been bent by the power of wealth and those possessing a wealth of power, but it has never been tested as it is being tested now. If it breaks, then something fundamental to the country’s meaning and function breaks, and repair will not be easy.</p><p>But as far as the Republican party and its leading candidate for the presidency, conservative members of the supreme court, and much of the Republican delegation in Congress – that is, parts of all three branches of the federal government – are concerned, someone should be above the law and all of the rest of us should be unequal under the law.
