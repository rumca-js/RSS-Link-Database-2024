In the midst of all the Marvel content that was released on Disney Plus during Phase 4, the first season of Loki was one of the series that arguably got the most favorable reactions from critics and fans alike. That’s why it’s now the first MCU show to get a second season.


Loki Season 2 definitely raises some questions. Like is this the first ever case of a flirtatious clock. How does time work differently at the TVA? Do we get to see Owen Wilson on a jetski?


To answer all these questions, check out the pitch meeting that led to Loki Season 2!
