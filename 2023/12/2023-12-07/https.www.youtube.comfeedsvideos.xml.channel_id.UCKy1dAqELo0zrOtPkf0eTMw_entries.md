The Boys Season 4 teaser trailer is chock full of political mayhem as the war between The Boys and The Seven expands to America at Large, but sometime else stood out to us in this preview of what's to come: Is Homelander about to die?

With Black Noir back on his feet after his altercation with Homelander in Season 3, and Senator Victoria Neuman's recent acquisition of a Supe-killing virus that started as a project to keep the leader of The Seven in check, it sure seems like there's a strong chance the star-spangled jerk won't be making it out of Season 4 alive. But, that doesn't mean we'll necessarily be losing Antony Starr! Check out our trailer breakdown for more on our theory.

Having trouble with RDA Outposts in Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora? Here's how to get a leg up by getting the very overpowered shotgun early.

The Shotgun in Avatar can take out enemy mechs really quickly, even one shotting them from behind without even really aiming. In order to get it, you need to travel to Gas Harvester Alpha after finishing the story quest titled "Becoming." After defending the medical base, you'll get an assault rifle and a Staff Sling, and then you can either head straight to the hometree or straight to the shotgun's location. We've included a step-by-step breakdown of how to infiltrate the camp and complete your objectives.

Usually, we only show the first 15 or so minutes of a game, but The Day Before has quite a long opening and we wanted to show at least SOME of the open-world gameplay. Was it worth it?

D'Artagnan, a spirited young Gascon, is left for dead after trying to save a young woman from being kidnapped. When he arrives in Paris, he tries to find his attackers. He is unaware that his quest will lead him to the heart of a real war where the future of France is at stake.

Allied with Athos, Porthos and Aramis, three musketeers of the King with a dangerous temerity, D'Artagnan faces the dark machinations of the Cardinal of Richelieu. But it is when he falls madly in love with Constance Bonacieux, the Queen's confidante, that d'Artagnan truly puts himself in danger. For it is this passion that leads him into the wake of the one who becomes his mortal enemy: Milady de Winter.

Samuel Goldwyn Films will release The Three Musketeers - Part I: D'Artagnan in US Theaters and On Digital and On Demand on December 8th, with the sequel in 2024.

The two films are based on the classic French adventure story by Alexandre Dumas and stars an all-star cast of Francois Civil ("Call My Agent!"),

Based on the astronomical trailer views alone, GTA 6 (Grand Theft Auto 6) is shaping up to be one of the biggest video game launches of all time. GTA 5 broke sales records when it released over a decade ago, and has managed to stay relevant since, across multiple console generations, selling millions more copies every year. All unreleased games deserve a certain amount of skepticism to keep hype in check, but Rockstar’s track record has earned a certain amount of trust from players, and the excitement around this long-awaited sequel will only get louder by the time 2025 rolls around.
