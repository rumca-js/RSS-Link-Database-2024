<p dir="ltr">Mr. and Mrs. Smith will switch things up for the upcoming TV series on Amazon Prime Video. The debut trailer for the show--based off the 2005 movie--highlights how Donald Glover and Maya Erskine's titular characters meet and then come together to work as spies. That's quite the departure from the film starring Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, where the couple is unaware of each other's undercover life.</p><p dir="ltr">That's not the only twist, either. This time, Mr. and Mrs. Smith are thrown into an arranged marriage and given their new names as John and Jane. The trailer teases this new take on the franchise early on, with Jane asking John if he's "ever killed anyone?" during what looks like a first date.</p><div>          </div><p dir="ltr">For those unfamiliar, the 2005 Hollywood action movie saw the couple find out about their undercover lives when their respective agencies direct them to kill each other.

<p>Burrow's End is my favorite season of <a href="https://www.dropout.tv/dimension-20">Dimension 20</a>. Every season of Dropout's tabletop role-playing show is consistently fantastic, dipping into multiple genres and TTRPG systems (though largely focusing on Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5e) and featuring talented cast members and Game Masters from across the improv, acting, and tabletop industry. But Burrow's End has been something special, delving into familiar mechanics and then sprinkling some inspiration from well-known books like Watership Down and Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH to tell a gripping 10-episode story. The players (who are all role-playing as members of a family of stoats living in Eastern Europe during the '80s) are regularly tempted with the power fantasy that's central to D&amp;D, knowing that succumbing to it could perpetuate the cyclical nature of the violence and fascism that pops up in our real world. Burrow's End is horrifying at times, heartfelt at others, and

<p>January is usually a lean month for high-profile new releases on the gaming calendar, and it's about to get even drier as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/alone-in-the-dark/">Alone in the Dark</a> has been delayed to March 20. Originally scheduled to launch next month, THQ Nordic confirmed the delay for a good reason. As the holiday season fast approaches and everyone looks to catch their breath, developer Pieces Interactive will be looking to avoid having to crunch on the game to reach the initial January 16 deadline.</p><p>"With our initially planned release date in January 2024, the Christmas season would have been filled with stress and anything but a jolly time for them," THQ Nordic and Pieces Interactive wrote in a press release. "Therefore, THQ Nordic and Pieces Interactive have decided to give Alone in the Dark a new release date: March 20, 2024.

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/warhammer-40000-rogue-trader/">Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader</a> arrives this week, and the first reviews are starting to come in. As a game that can easily take over 100 hours to finish, many reviews are still in progress, though most critics praised how faithfully Owlcat Games captured the atmosphere of the 40K universe.</p><p>As an extensive CRPG based on a popular tabletop game, it's inevitable that Rogue Trader has been compared to Baldur's Gate 3 in almost every review, though not always favourably. Reviewers have said that Rogue Trader is far more crunchy and complicated than Larian's newbie-friendly RPG, though it may still appeal to fans of Baldur's Gate 3.</p><p>The main complaint critics had about Rogue Trader was the proliferation of bugs, which will likely be mopped up by future updates after the game's release. Some also criticized the game's overly complicated ruleset, though some players will no doubt appreciate the system's

<p> Now that the first official footage from the hotly anticipated <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi/">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> has been released, GameSpot has compared the 2023 take on Vice City to 2002's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vice-city/">Grand Theft Auto: Vice City</a> in a new video. Graphical improvements aside, GTA 6 looks to be staying close to the feel of the original.</p><p> In the video, GameSpot compares some of the locations shown in the brand-new trailer to their equivalents in the old Vice City, from beaches to streetscapes, and the Vice City skyline. There's even a nightclub scene that's reminiscent of Vice City's iconic Malibu Club, and the Ocean View Hotel can be glimpsed in the background of one shot.</p><p>While the 2002 graphics can't quite compare to the modern game, Rockstar seems to have captured the feeling of the original game.

<p>Fortnite Chapter 5 has been pretty great so far in the ways that matter most--the battle royale gameplay feels different in a good way, and the battle pass is one of Fortnite's best ever. But it's also managed to introduce a totally revamped locker UI that adds support for new cosmetics related to the new Lego, Rocket League and Festival modes--and which makes the customization experience a lot worse than it used to be, inspiring a ton of backlash from fans--<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/18ccwgs/how_the_hell_did_the_new_locker_ui_make_it_to/">this</a> has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/18a9wpo/removing_the_special_backgrounds_for_the_special/">been </a>an <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/18ammut/i_know_its_already_been_said_but_the_new_locker/">even</a> bigger <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/18a7fbu/the_locker_ui_update_ruined_my_presets_and_my/">topic</a> on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r
