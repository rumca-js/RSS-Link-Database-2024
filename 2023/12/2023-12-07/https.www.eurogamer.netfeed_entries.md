So if you need a quick summary of everything that's happened, or you simply want to watch it along with us then please do - we've got your back. </p><p>Oh, and this year there's bingo. That's right, in an effort to stay awake and keep ourselves entertained, we've come up with a bingo card full of things Geoff Keighley may or may not do during the show. We think you'll like it.</p><p>The Game Awards 2023 begins at the ungodly hour of half-past midnight in the UK (0.30am GMT) and is likely to run on way past 3am. But think of all the announcements! I know Geoff Keighley has changed the language away from "world premieres" for the event, which suggests he doesn't have many world premieres, but there's still likely to be lots to talk about. In fact - te

Looks like there is going to be a Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown demo.
</p><p>
This demo was presumably meant to be announced tonight as part of the game awards. Ubisoft previously confirmed it would release a story trailer at the show later today. However, it has <a href="https://twitter.com/BossBigBoss73/status/1732784476244115633">leaked</a>, and mention of a demo is featured towards the end of the video's two and a bit minute run. 
</p><p>
The demo will seemingly be available a week ahead of the game's full release. We will update you when this news is confirmed.

Players will be able to play as their captured creatures in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/scarlet-violet-hidden-treasure-area-zero-dlc-new-returning-pokemon-9332">Pok&eacute;mon Scarlet and Violet's DLC, The Indigo Disk</a>.
</p><p>
The second chapter of DLC will include a device called the Synchro Machine that will allow players to sync up with one of their Pok&eacute;mon and then move around and battle wild Pok&eacute;mon. 
</p><p>
While we've played as Pok&eacute;mon in spin-off games, this is a first for the main series. It's all part of a new quest to help a certain scientist in the Terarium with her research.

## Baldur's Gate 3 characters were once "very old" and "ugly"

Baldur's Gate 3 once looked quite different from how it looks today. 
</p><p>
According to Baldur's Gate 3 lead character artist Alena Dubrovina, the game's development - at least in terms of its art - started out "pretty bumpy, actually".
</p><p>
"We couldn't figure out the visual look that we wanted because of the very limited skill sets that we had," Dubrovina told <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/baldurs-gate-3-interview">GQ</a>. "Within the first year, we probably changed direction three times."

## Baldur's Gate 3's new epilogues wrestle fan service and narrative weight

Baldur's Gate 3's newest patch is the latest to address not just bug fixes or the occasional glitchy animation, but to bring in new additions to the game in response to popular demand. Along with both a customisable difficulty setting and a bragging-rights, one-save-file only mode, the update brings with it new epilogues to see off the characters you've spent so long getting to know. With the vast majority of players rolling an original character - rather than playing as one your companions, as is the recommended choice in Larian's previous game, Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Baldur's Gate 3 has earned a fan base that's deeply attached to their characters, and its new endings are emblematic of how Larian intend to interact with them.

When I first played it back in the summer, the game's ending was the culmination of an ac

Nintendo has cancelled the Nintendo Live Tokyo 2024 event planned to run in January due to safety fears, following threats to staff and visitors. 
</p><p>
A Splatoon esports event due to be held next weekend has also been postponed, and the game's World Championship 2024 has been delayed until further notice. 
</p><p>
Nintendo has not detailed the exact nature of these safety concerns, other than a <a href="https://twitter.com/Nintendo/status/1732694410276802658">statement</a> released via X, formerly Twitter, that noted it had received "persistent threats targeting our employees" which had recently also "spread to spectators" at the upcoming Splatoon event.

The second season of HBO's The Last of Us adaptation will air in 2025, it has now been confirmed.
</p><p>
As part of a new <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/C0hbHxcA26x/?igshid=ZjI0YTZmZTMwMg%3D%3D">sizzle reel</a> showcasing HBO's upcoming slate of shows and original series, the company shared a little teaser for what fans can expect in 2025. Along with White Lotus and Euphoria, The Last of Us also showed up here. 
</p><p>
In a clever little bit of editing, the clips shown for the series show Bella Ramsey's Ellie from season one stating: "We are going to finish what we started." There is also a clicker in there, because of course.

## Lego Fortnite feels a Minecraft for the metaverse era

Remember when Fortnite was just about building? Before its celebrity cameos, its attention-grabbing live events, before you could play battle royale in Zero Build, and before the game let users make up their own endless variety of modes. Fortnite was a simpler game - you constructed a base, defended it from enemies. And in some ways, today's big launch of Lego Fortnite feels a return to those simpler times. 
</p><p>
Where the original Fortnite Save The World mode was a tower defense title, Lego Fortnite - in its current iteration at least - borrows mostly from Minecraft. You chop down trees and mine rocks for Lego resources, which can be crafted into Lego pickaxes, swords, or Lego building chunks. Said chunks - clusters of Lego bricks arranged into archways or staircases, campfires or even full buildings - can then be

I have said it before and I will say it again, Jack Black is the gift that keeps on giving. 
</p><p>
In the performer's latest TikTok video, Black has once again dressed up as Bowser, whom he voiced for the Super Mario Bros. Movie. That in itself is enough to make me smile anyway, but there is more. 
</p><p>
You see, he has also taken this opportunity to serenade us with a catchy remix of the film's hit song, Peaches.

Day of the Devs does know how to put on a good show, and its latest indie games spotlight - officially a special The Game Awards edition - was another winner, bringing release dates for the long-awaited likes of Open Roads and Flock, plus a bunch of other reveals. We got a psychedelic sequel to 2021's acclaimed jazz adventure Genesis Noir, the second entry in Digital Eclipse's stellar Golden Master Series - this time focusing on the legendary Jeff Minter - plus a load of weirdness, from landlord witches to callcentre horror, to enjoy. And if you missed the showcase live (which is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNvdds5yePY">still worth watching</a>, seeing as some of the footage included hasn't yet been published as standalone trailers), you can see everything you missed below.
