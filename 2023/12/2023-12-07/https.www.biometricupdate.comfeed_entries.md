		The Council of the European Union has introduced changes to a proposed package of legislation to establish a legal basis for issuing mobile driver’s licenses into European Digital Identity Wallets.

The original pair of proposals came from the EU Commission, as part of a “road safety package.” The package includes a complete overhaul of the EU’s Directive on Driving Licenses, according to report from the Council’s General Secretariat on the proposed amendments.

Changes to the proposal include the alignment of the technical elements of mDLs with the revised eIDAS digital identity regulation. The Council also wants a stronger link between implementing acts and member states’ obligations.

		Airports in South Africa and Abu Dhabi are advancing plans for biometrics in airports in collaboration with Idemia and SITA, respectively, but Karachi, Pakistan's airport facial recognition system has been shut down.

At the same time, airport deals have faced criticism in Guyana for concerns around the erosion of sovereignty, and a lawsuit in the U.S. over the privacy of citizens.
<h2>Karachi Airport facial recognition system inactive due to 'lack of interest'</h2>
The facial recognition system that was first activated just a few months ago at Karachi’s Jinnah International Airport is no longer operational, due to authorities' “lack of interest” in maintaining the system, according to <a href="https://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2023/12/06/facial-recognition-system-a

For years, arbitration has offered businesses a lower-cost alternative to expensive class action litigation. Recently, however, companies have seen a sharp uptick in the use of abusive mass arbitration by the plaintiff’s bar to neutralize arbitration provisions and class action waivers and, more importantly, gain leverage to extract sizeable settlements regardless of the merits of the underlying claims.

This tactic has been used with increasing frequency particularly in Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/bipa">BIPA</a>) class action litigation, where businesses have been forced to choose between paying blackmail settlements t
