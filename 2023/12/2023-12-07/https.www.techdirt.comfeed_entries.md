Two years ago Techdirt wrote about an attempt by Sony Music in Germany to implicate Quad9, a free anycast DNS platform (Cloudflare has technical details on what “recursive” means in this context), in copyright infringement at the domains it resolves. That was bad news for at least two reasons. First, because Quad9 is operated by [&#8230;]

No one&#8217;s more willing to abuse a law than a cop. They pretend they don&#8217;t understand the complexities of laws when it suits them. But they&#8217;re always right on top of any law that might protect them from the consequences of their own actions. Enter the somewhat infamous &#8220;Marsy&#8217;s Laws&#8221; that have been passed in [&#8230;]

As you know, the Supreme Court is now considering the NetChoice/CCIA cases challenging two similar (but not identical) state laws regarding social media moderation. The laws in Florida and Texas came about around the same time, and were clearly written to target ideological speech. Both of them put restrictions on how certain social media apps [&#8230;]

Possibly legally-obtained funds traveling from Point A to Point B? Those belong to the law enforcement middlemen. That&#8217;s how Wyoming&#8217;s top court explains things, in a decision [PDF] that says money obtained from legal drug sales in other states can be stolen by cops who operate in a state where this drug isn&#8217;t legal. Those [&#8230;]

Over the years we’ve written about plenty of “cyberespionge” companies. Some engage in spyware or surveillance ware. Others actively hack devices. Almost all of these eventually get exposed through dogged investigative reporting. A few people reached out to point to this rather concerning Editor’s note that was posted to Reuters this week: Reuters has temporarily [&#8230;]

Back in September Mozilla released a scathing report showing how modern vehicles are a privacy shitshow. After studying vehicle systems for over 600 hours, researchers found that most cars hoover up vast swaths of sensitive location and other information on consumers, then, like most companies, sell access to that data to pretty much any nitwit [&#8230;]

In October, California became the first state in the nation to ban &#8220;excited delirium&#8221; as an official cause of death. While this was a positive development, the question remains: why did it take so long? &#8220;Excited delirium&#8221; was never a real thing. It has always been a convenient excuse for deaths at the hands of [&#8230;]

For some reason, there are enough people who are ignorant enough about trademark law such that every once in a while you get people who don&#8217;t like a thing trying to trademark that thing thinking they can prevent that thing from being done or used.
