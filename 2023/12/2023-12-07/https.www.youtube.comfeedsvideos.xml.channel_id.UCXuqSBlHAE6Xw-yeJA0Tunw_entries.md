Who doesn’t like a free CPU? The answer is a bit more complicated than you’re imagining. This computer might look small and unassuming, but inside it is a motherboard you’ve never seen before, a 64-core processor unlike anything you currently own, and the technology behind it could have far reaching geopolitical implications in the very near future. It is the subject of trade sanctions, stock dumps, and could lead us into the next technology-fueled cold war. But can it game?
