However, a new tool from Redfin \u2014 powered by AI, of course \u2014 is designed to help. Redfin Redesign, which launches today on listings from Redfin and Bright MLS, allows consumers to alter the appearance of walls, floors and countertops &#8220;in just a few clicks,&#8221; said Ariel Dos Santos, Redfin&#8217;s senior vice president of product. &#8220;Buyers often want to know what a home will look like with some changes, not just what it looks like right now,&#8221; Dos Santos said. &#8220;Sellers want&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2023/redfin-ai-tool-allows-home-shoppers-to-virtually-redesign-rooms/\">Read More</a>", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2023/redfin-ai-tool-allows-home-shoppers-to-virtually-redesign-rooms", "date_published": "2023-12-07T19:12:29+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "GeekWire", "album": "GeekWire", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://www.geekwire.com/wp-content/themes/geekwire/dist/images/geekwire-logo-rss.png", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed/", "title": "Nirvana\u2019s Krist Novoselic and other Microsoft shareholders press company on AI safety", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"270\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/nirvanas-krist-novoselic-and-oth.jpg\" width=\"480\" /><br />Is Microsoft rushing too quickly to capitalize on artificial intelligence at the expense of long-term shareholder value? That was a key question at the company&#8217;s shareholder meeting Thursday morning.

In a video played during the virtual meeting, Novoselic asserted that Microsoft has rushed its generative AI products to market, saying that the company should do more to consider and address AI&#8217;s risks.
