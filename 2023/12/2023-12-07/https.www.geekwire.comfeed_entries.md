However, a new tool from Redfin — powered by AI, of course — is designed to help. Redfin Redesign, which launches today on listings from Redfin and Bright MLS, allows consumers to alter the appearance of walls, floors and countertops &#8220;in just a few clicks,&#8221; said Ariel Dos Santos, Redfin&#8217;s senior vice president of product. &#8220;Buyers often want to know what a home will look like with some changes, not just what it looks like right now,&#8221; Dos Santos said. &#8220;Sellers want&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/redfin-ai-tool-allows-home-shoppers-to-virtually-redesign-rooms/">Read More</a>

That was a key question at the company&#8217;s shareholder meeting Thursday morning. Krist Novoselic, the musician and author who co-founded the iconic band Nirvana, served as the spokesperson for a shareholder initiative asking the company to carefully study and report on the impact of its AI initiatives. In a video played during the virtual meeting, Novoselic asserted that Microsoft has rushed its generative AI products to market, saying that the company should do more to consider and address AI&#8217;s risks.

If the project works out as hoped, it could lead to a deeper understanding of the mechanisms behind cellular processes &#8212; including, for example, how tumors grow &#8212; and point to new methods for fighting disease and promoting healthy cell growth. Over the next five years, the Seattle Hub for Synthetic Biology will receive $35 million from the&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/seattle-hub-for-synthetic-biology-recording-cells/">Read More</a>
