There are surely reasons to purchase this package, primarily the fact that the incredible Arkham Asylum and Arkham City are still unmissable experiences, even if their Switch ports have some performance issues. \n\nHowever, the trilogy\u2019s version of Arkham Knight is an absolute mess, to the extent that it\u2019s hard to believe it was allowed to release. It looks ugly as sin, it runs like an absolute dumpster fire, and absolutely none of the game\u2019s strengths \u2013 of which it admittedly has many \u2013 are able to rise to the surface in this horrid port. That, combined with the fact that even Asylum and City have better versions available on other platforms, makes this collection a tough sell.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJaZOHSK6f4", "date_published": "2023-12-07T17:30:05+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "GamingBolt", "album": "GamingBolt", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/iJaZOHSK6f4/hqdefault.jpg", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "10 Beginners Tips And Tricks Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora Doesn't Tell You", "description": "As gorgeous as it is, the Western Frontier in Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora can be unforgiving, especially when jumping in for the first time.

Hunting without guns to ensure the best materials, various Skills, and the Hunter's Guide are just some ways to thrive in the wilderness and gain an edge.
