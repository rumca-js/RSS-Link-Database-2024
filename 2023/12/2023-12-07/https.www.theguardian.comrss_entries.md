<p>The muscular multicultural Britain that we enjoy today owes so much to the late poet and writer’s fearless work</p><p>Respect for your elders is a pillar of Blackness. This means that in most – if not all – African communities, whether continental, in the Caribbean or in the diaspora, it is somewhat offensive to speak to an elder as you would a peer. For example, it can be disparaging to refer to an elder on a first-name basis. It would also be wise not to use the word “elder” lightly, and to distinguish between elders and people who are just older than you. Elders bring things to the table. They share the wisdom that their years have granted them, nurture the young, insist on better behaviour, find ways to continually improve the community and demonstrate their love. Respect is the bare minimum; reverence is the more appropriate honour.</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/dec/07/british-poet-benjamin-zephaniah-dies-aged-65">Benjamin Zephaniah</a> was an elder.

Or one could just chillax and dance along to the formidably catchy songs, performed with zip by the peppy and exceedingly well choreographed cast. While one is grooving along, it’s worth noting that every so often the film-makers have smuggled in a quietly subversive thought, such as in the song Everything Is Politics which argues, <em>pace</em> Marxist philosopher Louis Althusser, that there is no position outside the ideological apparatus. It’s that very dualism which makes this goofy musical fascinating, a guilt-free pleasure t

<p>As our relationship with comedy has shifted, so has the role of comedian in mainstream culture, says author Jesse David Fox</p><p>When Chris Rock wants to figure out if a new idea is funny, he performs without the aspects of his persona that make him distinct: he doesn’t repeat the premise several times throughout a joke, or pace the stage, or make certain words two syllables as opposed to one. He delivers the joke flatly.</p><p>Rock feels that’s the only way he can take the temperature of what is actually funny, since the popularity of his standup over the last 33 years has made him so famous, audiences give him the benefit of the doubt when he walks on stage. It’s a process of bombing as a means to combat fame.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/dec/07/comedy-book-jesse-david-fox-chris-rock-dave-chappelle-jon-stewart">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Impossible to resist and with a revelatory cast, this is the absolute apex of brutal, addictive competition shows. Even if, ultimately, the joke is on us</p><p>There is something deeply dispiriting about watching three people gaze upwards at a giant orb containing more than $4.5m and getting excited because another few thousand bucks are being added to it. But as metaphors for modern capitalism go, this scene, early in the final episode of Squid Game: The Challenge, is wonderfully, queasily on the nose. Accumulation is an end in itself and, as has become standard practice in “last person standing” shows such as The Apprentice and films such as The Hunger Games, the winner takes all.</p><p>That was what was so striking about the drama that spawned this extraordinary challenge show.

<p>An update on the first half of the UN climate conference in Dubai, including shock over the host president’s comments</p><p>A summary of some of the news from the first half of the Cop28 UN climate conference in Dubai, including a spectacular row about the host president’s remarks on the science of fossil fuels, negotiations around fossil fuel reduction commitments, and other successes and setbacks so far.</p><p><em>“On the crucial issue of the phase-out of fossil fuels, language that would commit countries to a phase-out had been retained in the text but the option of that being deleted was not ruled out.

One of the 12 founder members of the Football League, they have always had that vibe, a sheepskin coat of a club in a league full of trendy anoraks. The magnificent Villa Park – with its brick facade, Holte End, wood-panelled innards and a grandeur befitting many an FA Cup semi-final – has seen it all in its 126-year history. And in the not-too-distant past, Villa have been champions of England, champions of Europe. More recently, they have been relegated, promoted and a bit average. Villa fans have long dreamt of ending their near-30-year major trophy hiatus (no, we’re not counting the 2001 Intertoto Cup) but nobody thought that it could be the Premier League that ends the drought. The size of a trophy cabinet does not maketh a club (just ask Newcastle), but it certainly helps.</p> <a href="https://www.

<p>As a doctor, I will never forget those who died during Covid. Seeing Johnson lying to and dodging their families is sickening</p><p>All patients are vulnerable, but some patients are more vulnerable than others. Take, for example, those with learning disabilities or mental health diagnoses, or elderly, physically disabled or dying people. These groups of patients are more likely to be marginalised, neglected or silenced. In palliative medicine, my speciality, the most extreme form of silencing occurs when a patient literally loses their voice – perhaps because a cancer has invaded their larynx, or, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/mar/21/out-of-the-darkness-of-this-terrible-covid-year-has-shone-the-light-of-peoples-goodness">in the case of Covid</a>, because they are too desperately in need of oxygen to be capable of squandering any on the act of speech.</p><p>I would meet these patients with haunting frequency on the Covid wards.

<p>La Rochelle, Leinster and Toulouse are the trio to beat but with Europe’s best colliding there are some intriguing possibilities</p><p>One of the criticisms of the modern Champions Cup is that the exhilaration of the knockout stages is less widespread in the earlier rounds.

The two sides who have contested both the last two finals are also now being asked to set the early pace.</p><p>It is sending an unsubtle message to the rest of the field.

<p>We may want tradition to be mystical and ancient but in truth it’s exactly what we say it is – be that Baileys, beef rendang or turkey and all the trimmings</p><p>In early November, the nice woman at the checkout of my local Sainsbury’s pointed out a nearby stack of Baileys. “Just £10 a bottle,” she said, with a cheery wink. “Proper bargain.” I smiled thinly. She clearly had no idea what sort of a person I am. Baileys? In November? Don’t be so disgusting. Baileys is for Christmas. The annual bottle comes into my house on 20 December and not a day earlier. Because Christmas is a time for traditions, and the pre-Christmas bottle of Baileys is one of mine. I am stone-cold certain it is exactly what the Baby Jesus would have wanted. Why? Because I say so.</p><p>The word “tradition” is solid and reassuring; the things that word refers to are often rather less so.

These rolls, the pigeons, and the two boys were ethereal creatures. All of this happened at the same time: a boy ran towards a pigeon and glanced up at Levin with a smile; the pigeon beat its wings, and flew off, sparkling in the sun, amidst partic

<p>The rise of Madonna, Barbra Streisand in her own words, plus the stormy relationship of Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor are among this year’s highlights</p><p>For most writers, a memoir is a once in a lifetime event, but not for the poet and novelist Blake Morrison. Having already written memoirs about his late mother and father, he has turned his attention to his siblings in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/feb/12/two-sisters-by-blake-morrison-review-siblings-fatally-wounded-by-childhood" title="">Two Sisters</a> (Borough). The book details the life of Gill, his younger sister who died in 2019 from heart failure caused by alcohol abuse, alongside his half-sister Josie, the product of his father’s affair with a married neighbour, whose real parentage went unacknowledged for years. Morrison’s account of their struggles is tender, vivid and achingly sad.</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/aug/20/o-brother-by-john-niven-review-a-searing-study-of-

<p>Shoba, 70, and Hania, 68, met in 1989 at a silent meditation retreat in Massachusetts. Their first date lasted three days and, now retired, they live together in Portugal</p><p>After living in India with a Hare Krishna community, Hania didn’t know what to expect from a conventional lifestyle when she moved to western Massachusetts in the late 80s. “I’ve always been interested in spirituality, but after a long time travelling and living away, I wanted to explore life at home while working as a political fundraiser,” she says. In the autumn of 1989, she decided to take a break and go on a 10-day silent meditation retreat near her home.</p><p>It was there that she first set eyes on Shoba. “I was living in Boston and working for an engineering firm,” says Shoba. “I was just learning to meditate, but I’d never done 10 days in silence before. I saw Hania on the first day and remember thinking, ‘She’s done this a lot.’” As the days passed, they noticed that they got up at the same time f

<p>Loved ones, friends and complete strangers have all waded in. I’ve even been told I look just like the bloke from Up …</p><p>Oddly, given what I do for a living, I’m most uncomfortable drawing attention to myself, especially if it’s something to do with what I’m wearing. And still more if it concerns my glasses. I trace this back to my shame and embarrassment when I first had to wear specs 43 years ago. For most of that time I’ve got on fine wearing contact lenses but once long-sightedness joined short-sightedness on the lengthening list of my physical shortcomings, bifocal spectacles became more practical.</p><p>I bought a pair last summer which looked, to my underperforming eyes, like perfectly normal specs. My only reservation was that from some angles they bore similarities to the kind of stout-rimmed eyewear favoured by many men in my line of work. Let’s call it the “media wanker” style. But it was more serious than that. Upon arriving home, the initial, visceral reaction of

The New Romantics (as they would never have dreamed of calling themselves) were arty kids in London in the late 70s and early 80s; the scene evolved out of punk, and was born on the dancefloor of the Blitz club in Covent Garden where Boy George worked as coat-check attendant (so he could steal out of coat pockets, apparently). The door policy was brutal – Mick Jagger got turned away. “But all the freaks got in for free.”</p><p>And what freaks. This was the Thatcher era of grim recession and a lot of the “Blitz kids” lived in a squat in Warren Street in four of five Georgian houses knocked together.

These <em>familles zéro déchet</em><em>, </em>or zero-waste families, would receive training and attend workshops on topics such as making your own yoghurt and cleaning with homemade products, with the goal of halving their waste by the year’s end.

The student organisers looked at each other in dismay. Would their protest, pulled together in secrecy and haste, prove a flop? Then came a loud babble from inside the college.

Phew.</p><p>The strapping on part has its challenges, though. As I crouch in a squall of windblown snow, my gloved fingers struggle to adjust the ratchet clasps. And when I finally get to my feet, I tread with one snowshoe on the rim of another and immediately hit the deck again. Alf hands me my poles. “Better not use the loops,” he says. “You might break your wrist.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/20

That was the summer we cycled out of resistance. Can you picture it? More than 1,000 of us moving through an empty central London like a flock of birds. There was no hierarchy or dress code.

<p>The US politician was accused of telling extraordinary lies about everything from his previous jobs to his religion. Why did it take so long to boot him out of Congress? Adam Gabbatt explains</p><p>It’s a story that is already being turned into a movie by HBO. George Santos, the US politician seemed to have had an amazing life. He had worked on a Broadway show, appeared on the children’s series Hannah Montana, been a star volleyball player, was a noted academic and a successful businessman whose company was worth millions. Now he was in Congress pushing policies such as making the AR-15 rifle the national gun of America.</p><p>But as it turned out, many of the stories he told about himself were not just exaggerations, but outright lies. The politician was not even, as he had apparently said, Jewish. Yet, as US reporter <strong>Adam Gabbatt </strong>explains, surprisingly, this did not mean Santos lost his seat.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2023/dec/07/the-li
