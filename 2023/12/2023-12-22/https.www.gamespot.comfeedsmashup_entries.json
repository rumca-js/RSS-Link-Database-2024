So what's going on?</p><p>People throw around the term \"superhero fatigue\" as a reason to dismiss poorly performing comic book movies or TV shows. It's more complicated than that, though. In reality, a combination of factors are at play, including a misunderstanding of why people were so invested in the first arc of MCU movies, things Marvel Studios should've been doing to get viewers ready for the future of the franchise, and a wild miscommunication between the studio and its fans about what matters in these movies and shows.</p><h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Peopl", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-marvel-cinematic-universes-downward-spiral-kicked-into-high-gear-in-2023/1100-6519749/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-12-22T16:00:00+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "GameSpot", "album": "GameSpot", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null, "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "The Last Of Us Is GameSpot's 2023 TV Show Of The Year", "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">It was 2014 when the first adaptation of The Last of Us was announced.
