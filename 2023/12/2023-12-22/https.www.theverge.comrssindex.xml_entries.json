Apple continues to dominate in both performance and battery life, while Microsoft only had incremental upgrades for its Surface line, and Intel has waited until the very end of the year to try to respond to Apple\u2019s dominance. But 2024 looks set to be one of the most interesting years for laptops since the Windows 8 days, thanks to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/7/23907234/intel-windows-12-2024-refresh-launch\">a new version of Windows</a>, a big AI push, and another attempt at <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/15/239603", "link": "https://www.theverge.com/23979164/laptops-2024-ai-surface-windows-intel-amd", "date_published": "2023-12-22T13:30:00+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "The Verge", "album": "The Verge", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null, "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "title": "Podcasts are in the middle of a numbers and people crisis", "description": "<figure>\n      <img alt=\"Vector collage including images of a podcast microphone setup, the Spotify logo and the Apple Podcast logo.\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3ro2ZgW_Kl85DoxQ_Tgj2qz-qvU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/72989814/236889_EOY_PODCAST_CVirginia.0.jpg\" />\n        <figcaption>The Verge / Photo from Getty Images</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n\n  <p id=\"R9FWnO\">In the podcasting world, the year 2019 may seem like it happened in a parallel universe. <em>Vulture</em>\u2019s Nicholas Quah <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2019/09/podcasting-history-three-eras.html\">deemed it the beginning of the \u201cbig podcasting era,\u201d</a> pointing to the millions of dollars that Spotify invested in building out its podcast operation \u2014 and the expected domino effect as other companies follow suit. \u201cThere was podcasting before 2019, and there will be podcasting after 2019.
