This whirling image features a bright spiral galaxy known as MCG-01-24-014, which is located about 275 million light-years from Earth. In addition to being a well-defined spiral galaxy, MCG-01-24-014 has an extremely energetic core known as an active galactic nucleus (AGN) and is categorized as a Type-2 Seyfert galaxy.

Femtosecond transient microscopy is an important tool to study ultrafast transport properties of excited states in solid-state samples. Most implementations are limited to photoexciting a single diffraction-limited spot at the sample and tracking the temporal evolution of the ensuing carrier distribution, hence covering a very small sample area.

Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are a rare population of cells in tumor tissues that drive tumorigenesis, recurrence, and metastasis. Therefore, the development of anti-tumor therapies that can eliminate CSCs has significant implications for cancer treatment. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a therapeutic modality that uses a specific laser wavelength to activate photosensitizers, generating large amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS) to selectively inhibit tumor growth.

Compared to other cereals, millet (Panicum miliaceum L) has an important advantage—resistance to a more arid climate. Millet contains all the essential amino acids, 10%–15% of its composition is protein. However, millet yields less than wheat, for example. Therefore, it is planted less often and does not use its full potential.

Researchers report December 22 in the journal Current Biology that the more time reindeer spend ruminating, the less time they spend in non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) sleep. EEG recordings revealed that reindeer's brainwaves during rumination resemble the brain waves present during non-REM sleep, and these brainwave patterns suggest that the reindeer are more "rested" after ruminating.

The malaria parasite is a master of adaptation. To complete its life cycle, the parasite must be transmitted from a mosquito to a human and then back to a mosquito again. Over millions of years of evolution, it has adapted perfectly to these two hosts. But although we have known about the malaria cycle for over 100 years, many questions remain unanswered.
