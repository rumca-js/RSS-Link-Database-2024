It also does not take a genius to know that progressive prosecutors have no interest in prosecuting those who commit crimes. They would much rather go after productive members of society who are just trying to make a living by doing their jobs. Unfortunately, it is becoming far too common that we see authorities going after the victims of crimes rather than the criminals. </p><p><br /></p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\"></div> \u2014  (@)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TPostMillennial/status/1737930282026549504\"></a>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://thepostmillennial.com/police-investigate-security-guard-who-fired-shots-in-attempt-to-prevent-dc-chanel-store-from-being-looted\" targe", "link": "https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/chanel-security-guard", "date_published": "2023-12-22T17:41:24+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "Louder With Crowder", "album": "Louder With Crowder", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yMzE1NTQ3MS9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1MjE1Njc1MH0.cVUGcJzdyyjj3xKR7tPeQKtnP3_3j0yJ-3yt3wA91m8/image.png?width=210", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://louderwithcrowder.com/feed/", "title": "Mug Club on Hiatus", "description": "<img src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=50900398&amp;width=1245&amp;height=700&amp;coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0\" /><br /><br /><p>We'll be back in January!</p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\"></div> \u2014  (@)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LWCnewswire/status/1737870984344924499\"></a>\n</blockquote>", "link": "https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/mug-club-on-hiatus", "date_published": "2023-12-22T17:20:37+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "Louder With Crowder", "album": "Louder With Crowder", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yMzE1NTQ3MS9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1MjE1Njc1MH0.cVUGcJzdyyjj3xKR7tPeQKtnP3_3j0yJ-3yt3wA91m8/image.png?width=210", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://louderwithcrowder.com/feed/", "title": "Watch: Women Who Usually Dates Soy \u201cFelt The Feminism Leaving Her Body\u201d After Going On A Day With A Conservative Man", "description": "<img src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=50910274&amp;width=1245&amp;height=700&amp;coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C2\" /><br /><br /><p>When you constantly tell half the population that their biological masculine traits are \u201ctoxic\u201d of course you end up with a bunch of weak men who now refer to themselves as \u201cliberals.\u201d Society needs masculinity.
