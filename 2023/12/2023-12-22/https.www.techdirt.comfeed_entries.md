And ever since then, it has been making it more [&#8230;]

Half a decade ago we documented how the U.S. wireless industry was caught over-collecting sensitive user location and vast troves of behavioral data, then selling access to that data to pretty much anybody with a couple of nickels to rub together. It resulted in no limit of abuse from everybody from stalkers to law enforcement [&#8230;]

In 2023, the extreme ideology of “human extinction from AI” became one of the most prominent trends. It was followed by extreme regulation proposals. As we enter 2024, let’s take a moment to reflect: How did we get here? 2022: Public release of LLMs The first big news story on LLMs (Large Language Models) can [&#8230;]

Back in April we noted that the EU had designated 17 sites as “VLOPs” (Very Large Online Platforms), the “ROUSs” (Rodents of Unusual Size) of the internet. Some of those sites are still contesting the designation, but in the meantime, the EU Commission has dug deep into its porn viewing habits and designated three more [&#8230;]

Governments know the difference between right and wrong. It&#8217;s just that they often don&#8217;t seem to care. This is a small-ish wrong, but it&#8217;s a wrong nonetheless. Like far too many other state bodies charged with policing vanity plate messages, the South Dakota Motor Vehicle Division has a problem giving its tacit blessing to other [&#8230;]

By now we’ve well established that this particular&#160;series of media mergers&#160;&#8212; which began with AT&#38;T’s doomed acquisition of Time Warner and ended with Time Warner’s subsequent spin off and fusion with Discovery &#8212; were some of the dumbest, most pointless “business” exercises ever conceived by man.

The saga of former Nikola CEO Trevor Milton has come to a close. We began talking about Nikola, a company that bill itself as &#8220;decarbonizing&#8221; the trucking industry by selling electric long-haul trucks, back in 2020 when it was revealed that a very slick demo of its products had been totally staged. Like, hilariously staged. [&#8230;]

Last week in the Error 402 series on the past, present, and future of web monetization, we talked about the whole “information wants to be expensive, information wants to be free” dilemma, that partially explained why early paywalls failed, and why display and search ads seemed to be the primary way in which internet content [&#8230;]
