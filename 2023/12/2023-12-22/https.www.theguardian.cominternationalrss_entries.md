<p>Manager says the health scare involving their captain at Bournemouth is ‘still raw’ before Newcastle’s visit on Saturday</p><p>“It’s still very raw,” said Rob Edwards to no great surprise given his demeanour. The Luton manager was clearly tired and emotional, his words lacking their usual zest and positivity. Instead he was quiet, measured, downbeat and, it is safe to say, in no real mood to be at his weekly press conference. But he was here because he knew he needed to speak about the moment that gripped his club a week ago and refuses to let go.</p><p>It was during the 59th minute of Luton’s trip to Bournemouth last Saturday that everything changed. Out of nowhere Tom Lockyer, the visiting captain, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/dec/16/bournemouth-v-luton-fixture-called-off-after-tom-lockyer-collapses-on-pitch" title="">collapsed</a>.

<p>The disgraced ex-congressman seems to be trying to remake himself as a campy gay icon. Too many people are falling for it</p><p>George Anthony Devolder Santos was born in 1988 with a serious congenital condition which means he is incapable of feeling shame or embarrassment. I’m not sure what the name of the affliction is or whether it’s recognized by the medical establishment – but many of his former colleagues in government seem to suffer from the same thing.</p><p>Still, the disgraced New York Republican, who was expelled from Congress three weeks ago and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/10/27/1208478307/george-santos-charges-theft">pleaded not guilty</a> in October to a total of 23 federal felony charges ranging from wire fraud to money laundering, clearly has an extreme case.

<p>Boredom, nostalgia, good cheer … there are all sorts of reasons we send the ‘Long time no speak, how are you?’ message at this time of year</p><p>There’s a chill in the air, but it’s not just the December cold. As inevitable as the twinkling lights or gingerbread men, an unmistakable urge is making itself known. My fingers are twitching. I’m crafting the perfect opener in my head. That’s right: I’m starting to wonder whether I should text my ex-partner.</p><p>Since the last time we saw each other, earlier this year, I have been strict with myself. I drew a solid, impassable line between us, and I was happy about it – tearing our lives apart was difficult enough without the added confusion of staying in touch. But surrounded by a sea of hand-holding couples in matching Christmas jumpers, tunes that celebrate happy twosomes and twinkling skies of fairy lights, I might be having doubts. Maybe it wouldn’t be so bad to wish him a merry Christmas? Check in? Catch up? Reminisce together

The 20 stories that make up A Stroke of the Pen, written by Pratchett under the pen name Patrick Kearns in the 70s and 80s and published in the Western Daily Press, escaped destruction since no one, least of all their author, knew where to find them. But now they’ve been dug out of the newspaper’s archive with the help of Pratchett uber-fans Pat and Jan Harkin.</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/david-tennant">David Tennant</a>, Claire Foy, <a href="https://
