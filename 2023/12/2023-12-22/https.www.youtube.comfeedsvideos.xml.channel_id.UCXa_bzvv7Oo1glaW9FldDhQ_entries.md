Not every boss fight is about going blow for blow to the end. Sometimes, it's about matching wits with an enemy and trying to beat them in the mental game. While that can work out sometimes, certain video game villains are experts in playing mind games with the player.

Whether it's Ocelot from Metal Gear Solid and his long-term plans to manipulate everyone, Scarecrow with his Fear Toxin and obsessive drive to break Batman in the Arkham series, or the Illusive Man in Mass Effect, constantly scheming and doing deals with the galaxy's worst, there are always enemies that excel in psychological warfare.

Check out some iconic video game enemies that played mind games with players throughout the years, even without overwhelming strength.

2023 is finally behind us, and we can now focus on 2024 - a year which sees several major sequels, new properties, and even a dormant franchise or two making a comeback.

It starts in January with Tekken 8 and Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth. That's only the calm before the storm, as February features releases like Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League and Pacific Drive.

Before any downtime, March features the release of Rise of the Ronin. There's also S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl and more to look forward to early on. Let's go over everything else that next year has to offer.
