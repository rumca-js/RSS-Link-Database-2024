Sega has detailed more of its plans to revive a swathe of classic game franchises, including Jet Set Radio, Crazy Taxi, Golden Axe, Shinobi and Steets of Rage.
</p><p>
The announcement that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-announces-flurry-of-projects-including-jet-set-radio-crazy-taxi">Sega was working on new entries in the above series came as something of a suprise</a> this month, and with few other details. 
</p><p>
Now, we know just a little more about each of the projects, and have a first glimpse at how they'll presumably look.

Online servers for Dark Souls 2 will be shut down in March, for anyone still playing on either PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360.
</p><p>
Dark Souls developer FromSoftware made the announcement today in a <a href="https://twitter.com/DarkSoulsGame/status/1738077033442218190">statement</a> posted to X, formerly Twitter. 
</p><p>
"The Dark Souls 2 PS3 and Xbox 360 servers will shut down on 31st March 2024," the post confirmed. "A message stating that online play is disabled will be displayed. Offline play will still be possible."

Marvel's Spider-Man developer Insomniac Games has now released a statement addressing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-investigating-insomniac-hack-which-reportedly-leaked-wolverine-files-and-employees-personal-data">the ransomware attack on its studio earlier this month</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/devastating-leak-lays-bare-spider-man-developer-insomniacs-plans-for-the-next-decade">the release of stolen data this week</a>, and the spread of information on upcoming projects now circulating the internet.
</p><p>
The PlayStation studio had stayed silent until now, something it said was a result of it being "focused inward" to support team members. Personal data was included in the breach, Insomniac confirmed, but the studio is still "working quickly" to examine the impact.

## Best graphics of the year: Digital Foundry ranks its top games of 2023

Recently the Digital Foundry team met up online to discuss the best game graphics of 2023, with Alex Battaglia, John Linneman and Oliver Mackenzie nominating their favourite titles. What struck me about the list - reproduced in full at the end of the article - was how many titles <em>weren't</em> those that were pushing the absolute boundaries of graphics technology in terms of features. Instead, the games chosen - and especially the highest ranking options - were those that were smartly designed to both serve gameplay and take full advantage of the (often limited) hardware they were running on.
</p><p>
Hi-Fi Rush and Super Mario Bros. Wonder are perfect examples of this, I feel. Both games were first-party releases that distinguish themselves with a bold, consistent sense of style, with colourful and imaginative environments populated

Game development disaster The Day Before will go dark forever on 22nd January 2024.
</p><p>
A <a href="https://twitter.com/playdaybefore/status/1738112110385914052">statement</a> posted this morning to X, formerly Twitter, gave remaining players a month's notice that the game - once Steam's most-wishlisted title - would close down in just over 30 days.
</p><p>
As a reminder, The Day Before only launched in early access on 7th December. This means its servers will only have been active for 48 days total - even shorter than Liz Truss' tenure as PM.

Sony has said it will no longer delete Discovery content from PlayStation libraries following fan backlash.
</p><p>
In a statement, Sony said it had now struck an "updated licensing agreement" with Discovery owner Warner Bros. to ensure previously purchased content would remain accessible "for at least the next 30 months" (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/playstation-will-not-delete-discovery-tv-shows-after-all">GamesIndustry.biz</a>).

China has announced new rules to limit the encouragement of spending in online video games, spooking investors in two of the world's biggest publishers.
</p><p>
News of the limits wiped a combined ~$80bn from the value of Tencent and NetEase, China's two main games publishers that now support or part-own many of the world's biggest games companies.
</p><p>
Chinese online video games will now no longer be able to offer an extra incentive to spend in a game for the first time, or for spending repeatedly, Reuters reported.

One of my most bittersweet gaming memories is pretty recent - at most it was a couple of years ago. It was the day after we all knocked off work and I pulled the sofa round in front of the TV and played a game that I wasn't reviewing, or writing about, or checking up on to decide about coverage for. It was that Ubisoft Battle Royale. My memory is terrible and I just had to look up the name. It was Hyper Scape.
</p><p>
I had wanted to play it all year - that was the key fact here. I was and am a big fan of Battle Royale games, not for the shooting or competition so much as that if you land in a quiet part of the map you just get to pootle around and explore by yourself. It's a bit like being home from university unexpectedly and walking around town while the rest of your old friends are still away.

Hyper Scape was perfect for t

The British teenager who hacked Rockstar and posted a swathe of work-in-progress <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> development material online last year has been sentenced to remain indefinitely in a secure hospital.
</p><p>
Arion Kurtaj, now 18, was part of the Lapsus$ hacking group behind similar attacks on Nvidia, Uber and BT, among others.
</p><p>
Kurtaj hacked Rockstar in September 2022, while already on bail for hacking charges and staying under police protection at a Travelodge, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-67663128?s=31">BBC News</a> reported.

## People are posting footage of Marvel's Wolverine from stolen, early version

Marvel's Wolverine is still years from release, but people are currently playing - and uploading footage - of an incomplete early development build found within the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-investigating-insomniac-hack-which-reportedly-leaked-wolverine-files-and-employees-personal-data">files stolen from Insomniac Games by ransomware hackers earlier this month</a>. 
</p><p>
It's remarkable to see an in-development game being played in this way - and I can't think of a similar situation, at least in recent memory. The GTA 6 hack contained a mountain of development assets, yes, but nothing playable in this manner. 
</p><p>
Here, people have been able to access a test build of Wolverine akin to an internal demo meant for Insomniac and Sony, that features multiple sections of the game available to play and explore. N

Welcome back to our regular feature where we write a little bit about some of the games we've found ourselves playing over the last few days. This will be our last What We've Been Playing of the year - of 2023 - which means when we come back in January, we'll be able to talk about what we played, or what we did not manage to play, during the end of year break. That's exciting isn't it? Anyway!
