<p>Seven minutes into nine minutes of second-half stoppage time Nicoló Zaniolo rescued a point for Aston Villa against lowly Sheffield United but Unai Emery’s annoyance at their failure to take victory is unlikely to subside anytime soon.</p><p>The question Emery will surely ask himself is would bona fide title contenders fail to beat the team that began the day bottom of the pile? Of course the flipside is to consider the determination Villa showed to keep pushing when it seemed it was going to be one of those days, a missed opportunity. But Zaniolo headed in late on to grab a point when it seemed all was lost. Cameron Archer’s 87th-minute strike looked to have snatched victory for the Blades but the former Villa’s youngster’s goal proved inadequate to earn their first away win of the season.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/dec/22/aston-villa-sheffield-united-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

Perhaps it was fitting that Julián Álvarez, a star in becoming a champion with Argentina a year ago, began and finished what ended up as a lesson in control against the Brazilian side Fluminense.</p><p>A moment like this might never come again, Pep Guardiola had cautioned; City met it and have now completed the full house of major trophies that rubber stamps their era of dominance. An own goal by Nino and a close-range finish by Phil Foden were bookended by Álvarez’s contributions and the only sour note, as City sought to celebrate after full time, was a bizarre on-pitch confrontation between players and officials from both sides.</p> <a href="https

<p>From Culprits to Reservation Dogs, there’s been too much incredible comedy and drama to watch this year.

Patricia Arquette’s joyously dishevelled turn as a drug-raddled ex-dealer who decides to go into crime-fighting is a surreal, raucous treat. If anything, the outrageous twists and turns of this wryly comic series were even more out there than Natasha Lyonne’s series.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/dec/22/one-of-tvs-most-underrated-shows-the-best-television-you-never-watched-in-2023">Continue reading...</a>

Usually I’m the only non-meat eater at mine, and I’ve got used to just eating the sides.

I love making them because they can be prepped ahead and finished at the last minute. The problem now is that I have to make enough for the others to have a taste: who can resist a creamy, breadcrumb-flecked sprout gratin or a veg-packed filo pie laced with stilton?

Despite the chaos, a few hours after the blast a small group of workers inside the facility carried on with their invisible yet crucial task for the country’s morale and resilience – to cut flowers.</p><p>Flowers have always held a special place in Ukrainian culture, but their significance has soared during the conflict.

<p>Around the world, the people fighting for the survival of our planet are being shamefully silenced and villified</p><p>Injustice is easy to oppose after it has receded into the past, and there is no cost to imagining yourself as a hero long after the event. Everyone celebrates the suffragettes now, but at the time they were vilified as hateful spinsters and terrorists.

Growing up in south London with a single mother and siblings, I didn’t think of myself as poor because everyone around me was the same. In a pre-digital world, the riches shown on TV were a fantasy no more connected to my life than Grizzly Adams or Lee Majors.</p><p>Christmas in our house was low-key: rice and peas, lamb and plantain dinner, and lazing around watching TV. Presents were perfunctory and after 13, they dried up completely. I learned very early that there was lots of great stuff in the world and I was unlikely to own very much of it. I felt about Christmas how I still feel about Valentine’s Day. It meant obligation, debt, guilt, and emoting on demand.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/dec/22/a-christmas-that-changed-me-i-distributed-meals-on-my-bike-and-found-friendship

<p>From Poor Things and Passages to All of Us Strangers, the year showed a varied and graphic look at how sex can impact us all</p><p>Bella Baxter, the absurd, Frankenstein-esque creation brought to life by Emma Stone in Yorgos Lanthimos’s film Poor Things, really wants sex. She first discovers pleasure by herself, rapturously, before essentially fucking her way across Europe. The experience turns her world into luscious technicolor and sharpens her sense of agency and injustice. Mostly, she just enjoys it, frequently and in many positions, Stone fearlessly goes for every note of carnal ecstasy. She is, as Vulture’s Rachel Handler <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/emma-stone-in-poor-things-yorgos-lanthimos.html">put it</a>, one of the most shamelessly sexual characters committed to screen.</p><p>A blank slate able to experience her own desire completely devoid of social conditioning or judgment, Bella would be confused by the mixed reaction to the film’s sexual fantasia.

It did feel like the small flame of something really sacred that we were all collectively on a mission to honour. The first time I met Celine [Song, the director], we were two little girls scheming together about what felt like a really huge flex: can we make something that’s really precious and intimate <em>monumental</em>, and reach a lot of people? As we move more into a world that honours what sometimes seems to be the loudest voice in the room, I’m curious about something that isn’t that. That being said, you have no idea if something is going to pay off, or what kind of audience it’s going to find, and it’s so s

A porter rushes out to meet it from the back door of the hotel kitchen, lugging a large white rice sack.

In 2022, she was in the top 20 most performed living composers worldwide. Her first orchestral commission, a concerto for percussion and orchestra, was performed at the Proms in 1998. This was, as she notes modestly in a footnote in her new book, the first time since the festival began in 1895 that a Black woman’s music had been performed there.

The season of goodwill is an annual occasion for a highly politicised bout of ill will between traditionalists, who see a nativity scene in the town hall as an expression of France’s Christian heritage, and secularists, who say it violates <em>la laïcité</em> (secularism), the strict separation of state and religion enshrined in a <a href="https://www.worldhistory.org/article/2094/frances-1905-law-of-separation-of-church-and-state/">1905 law</a>.</p><p>The squabbles are so fierce, yet so petty, that they recall <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clochemerle">Clochemerle, Gabriel Chevallier’s 1934 satire</a> about a feud over the erection of a public <em>pissotière</em> (urinal) in the church square of a bucolic village.

Mum was coming to pick me up from university and bring me home for the Christmas holidays. It was my fourth year at the University of Southampton, and I’d just begun a PGCE in primary education, training to become a teacher. I loved every second of university life, but I couldn’t wait to go home. There was nothing that made me happier than the thought of Christmas with my family.</p><p>Our small celebrations were the same every year. I could picture it. Mum, my stepdad Cliff, my younger brother Ollie and me, all dressed up and opening presents on Christmas morning by the tree, the same festive CD soundtracking our day.

<p>Even Scrooge would marvel at Queen Mary’s pay-docking over a marking boycott. No wonder higher education is in turmoil</p><p>In this season of quizzing, here’s a real head-scratcher. Can you name the big British employer that punished staff for boycotting a small fraction of their work by taking <em>all of their pay</em> for each day of their boycott? So that even while employees did their other tasks, putting in weeks of work, their pay packets were pilfered, month after month, from high summer until almost the start of advent. Some had to take extra jobs, others drew on hardship funds or stuck essential bills on credit cards. Amid a cost of living crisis and with Christmas looming, the Great Wage Robbery carried on. But who was responsible?</p><p>Perhaps your imagination has entered some grim distribution hangar, or is hovering above a building site.
