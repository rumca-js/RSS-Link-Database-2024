Hello and welcome to TUESDAY NEWSDAY! Your number one resource for the entire week's worth of VR news! This week the Quest 3 receives 4 things that I have been WAITING for. Depth API, Inside out Body tracking, generative legs, Xbox Cloud connect, and of course! ASGARDS WRATH! We also get a sneak peak into Mirror Lake, Meta's newest prototype headset design.. and Pico, Meta's biggest competition leaves the race. I hope you enjoy!

You can find the APK for Depth API on my discord- It's also where you can join in my Christmas Meetup!
