In a year brimming with gaming highs and lows, 2023 has witnessed a mix of remarkable successes and unforgettable misses. From renowned titles like The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom to Baldur’s Gate 3 to… Redfall. High highs were coupled with low lows, and all those nostalgic remakes and sequels came alongside a different sort of blast from the past thanks to a slew of underwhelming licensed games, be that The Lord of the Rings: Gollum, Skull Island: Rise of Kong, or The Walking Dead: Destinies.

Embracing the paradox that 2023 presented, we present every game that earned a score of four or lower on IGN this year.
