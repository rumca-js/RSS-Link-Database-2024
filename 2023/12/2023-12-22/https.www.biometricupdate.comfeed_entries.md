		An EU-funded project, VEDLIoT (Very Efficient Deep Learning in IoT), has been introduced to address the challenges associated with implementing deep learning in IoT systems. The VEDLIoT project developed <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202311/smart-home-market-embracing-edge-biometrics-for-improved-security-and-privacy">smart home</a> solutions, especially in facial recognition systems, equipped with local processing capabilities for data protection and privacy. The project is designed to provide a secure and privacy-focused solution for various industries through intuitive interaction, local AI processing, and efficient AI hardware accelerators.

		The U.S. Federal Trade Commission, unencumbered by more conservative members, is changing the nation's primary regulation controlling commercial access to children's personal data.

The FTC issued a statement this week saying it <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/p195404_coppa_reg_review.pdf">intends</a> to change the Children's Online Privacy Protection, or <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202006/ftc-debate-really-fight-todays-violators-or-find-more-crime-to-be-overwhelmed-by">COPPA</a> rule, last updated a decade ago. It is seeking public comment.

Any changes would likely be somewhat easier to implement given that the current FTC's two Republican commissioners resigned in the last year in protest of what they

		Biometrics security on mobile devices is great unless it's not turned on. Or if it gets turned off.

Researchers with a Dutch computer services firm have identified a variant of a known banking trojan that forces a device to switch from biometric authentication to PIN authentication. <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/threatfabric">ThreatFabric</a> says the malware can then unlock the device.

		Popular porn sites Pornhub, Stripchat and XVideos will be forced to prevent European minors from accessing their content online, including with age verification tools, after receiving a new designation under the European Union’s Digital Services Act (DSA).

On Wednesday, the adult websites joined the ranks of Google, Facebook, Amazon, LinkedIn and 15 other sites designated as Very Large Online Platforms (VLOPs). The designation comes after the European Commission investigation concluded that the three services fulfill the threshold of 45 million average monthly users in the EU.

Under the Digital Services Act, VLOPs are obliged to adopt stringent content moderation, transparency and accountability measures. They will also have to introduce strong protect

		The Australian government has released a set of recommendations for updating the MyGov digital identity, confirming the introduction of passwordless logins and promising to expand its uses.

MyGov is used for accessing government services, and has been facing heavy criticism this year for its vulnerability to scams and fraud which has cost the government <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202311/australias-mygov-digital-id-lost-2b-due-to-scams-this-year">billions of dollars</a>.

		Multimodal biometrics provider <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/innovatrics">Innovatrics</a> has announced it has ranked number one in the NIST Evaluation of Latent Friction Ridge Technology (ELFT) test, making its latent fingerprint algorithm the most accurate in the world.

The algorithm reached a rank-1 hit rate of 93.3 percent. Hit rate is derived from FNIR – false negative identification rate. It represents the percentage of times when the correct subject is at or above a rank in the candidate list. Only eight companies submitted algorithms to the ELFT benchmark.

		Burundi will spare no effort in providing its residents with biometric identity cards before the 2025 elections, the Ministry of Interior says.

The project is at an advanced stage, according to Interior Minister Martin Niteretse, who recently <a href="https://mininterinfos.gov.bi/bientot-une-carte-didentite-biometrique-au-burundi/">addressed</a> local media. The new biometric IDs will replace paper ones and are seen as a critical requirement for the democratic process in the East African country, helping prevent multiple voting, age misrepresentation and electoral fraud. The card will also function as a travel document among Burundi’s East African neighbors that have signed on to <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202209/kenya-to-comply-with-regional-bloc-direc

		Companies offering telecommunications services in Nigeria have had a fresh order from the federal government to entirely block all SIM cards not linked to the biometrics-backed National Identification Number (NIN) by February 28, 2024, at the latest.

The directive has been handed down by the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), according to corporate notices issued by some of the telcos to their customers and partners.

In MTN Nigeria’s own notice cited by <a href="https://punchng.com/block-sims-without-nin-ncc-directs-mtn-airtel-others/">Punch</a>, the telco says the move is in line with an “industry-wide directive” which requires all SIM cards not linked to NINs, or those linked to unverified NINs, to be suspended on or before F

Due largely to their advanced technical preferences in commerce, Generation Z (Gen Z) and Millennials have summoned a new era of payments. Born after 1995, Gen Z has been defined as the first generation of true digital natives, having grown up with technology and social media available at their fingertips. With new expectations and behaviors coming from this generation – a change in approach from traditional banks is required to capitalize on their potential spending power.
