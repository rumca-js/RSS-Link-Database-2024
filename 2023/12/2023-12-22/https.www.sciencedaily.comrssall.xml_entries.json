[{"source": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/rss/all.xml", "title": "Reindeer sleep while chewing their cud", "description": "Researchers report that the more time reindeer spend ruminating, the less time they spend in non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) sleep. EEG recordings revealed that reindeer's brainwaves during rumination resemble the brain waves present during non-REM sleep, and these brainwave patterns suggest that the reindeer are more 'rested' after ruminating. The researchers speculate that this multitasking might help reindeer get enough sleep during the summer months, when food is abundant and reindeer feed almost 24/7 in preparation for the long and food-sparse arctic winter.", "link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2023/12/231222145453.htm", "date_published": "2023-12-22T14:54:53+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "Latest Science News -- ScienceDaily", "album": "Latest Science News -- ScienceDaily", "user": null, "language": "en-us", "thumbnail": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/scidaily-logo-rss.png", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/rss/all.xml", "title": "Hubble sights a galaxy with 'forbidden' light", "description": "A whirling image features a bright\u00a0spiral\u00a0galaxy\u00a0known as MCG-01-24-014, which is located about 275 million light-years from Earth. In addition to being a well-defined spiral galaxy, MCG-01-24-014 has an extremely energetic core known as an\u00a0active galactic nucleus\u00a0(AGN) and is categorized as a Type-2 Seyfert galaxy. Seyfert galaxies, along with quasars, host one of the most common subclasses of AGN. While the precise categorization of AGNs is nuanced, Seyfert galaxies tend to be relatively nearby and their central AGN does not outshine its host, while quasars are very distant AGNs with incredible luminosities that outshine their host galaxies.", "link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2023/12/231222145450.htm", "date_published": "2023-12-22T14:54:50+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "Latest Science News -- ScienceDaily", "album": "Latest Science News -- ScienceDaily", "user": null, "language": "en-us", "thumbnail": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/scidaily-logo-rss.png", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/rss/all.xml", "title": "Light color is less important for the internal clock than originally thought", "description": "Light in the evening is thought to be bad for sleep.
