The derailment of a local train, the tight surveillance, the development of artificial intelligence that relies on the enormous arithmetic power generated by the surveillance, the lives of the grassroots that are virtually worthless in the eyes of the Party, the unfathomable secrets behind the fires, and the red sky over  Zhongnanhai, the CCP's headquarters. They are intertwined to form a scene before an avalanche. \nFirst, let's look at a major train incident. \n\nHave questions? Do you have something to share with us about China?
