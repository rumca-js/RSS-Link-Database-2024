I've FINALLY got the GIANT Fanatic Complete set from The Army Painter - and I'm going to talk about the things inside that other people HAVEN'T talked about yet!

Vince Venturella and I made a 'zine! Check out SNARL at http://www.snarlingbadger.com

I'm now a partner on Twitch! I paint minis every Friday morning and Monday night, and sometimes take paint breaks (play video games poorly). Follow me: http://www.twitch.tv/tabletopminions
