On Friday, the company posted on X (Twitter) that “those who placed priority orders will receive their Ai Pins first when we begin shipping in March.” The company had previously given an “early 2024” estimate for the screen-less wearable device designed to replace a smartphone.</p>

<p>Insomniac Games has weighed in publicly for the first time since <a href="https://www.engadget.com/insomniac-games-hackers-leak-13-million-files-after-demanding-2-million-ransom-102134429.html">hackers leaked over 1.3 million of the publisher’s private files</a>.

<p>The publisher began by thanking supportive fans, many of whom rallied around the hacking victim in the thread’s comments, before relaying the burden the cyberattack inflicted on its employees. “We’re both saddened and a

<p>Handheld gaming systems are having a moment. While gaming on the go has been a thing since the Game Boy, the success of the Nintendo Switch and a string of ever-improving processors have brought an eruption of devices that let you play all sorts of games anywhere you want. Because new models seem to arrive every week, however, figuring out the best gaming handheld for you can be complicated.

To break down what’s going on, Devindra and Ben chat with <a href="https://twitter.com/chrissyfarr?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Christina Farr</a>, a health tech investor at OMERS Ventures and author of the <a href="https://ovsecondopinion.substack.com/">newsletter Second Opinion</a>. It turns out Apple has made a habit of tempting people away from competing companies, and that includes Masimo’s former chief medical officer. Did Apple really steal trade secrets? Or does it just look very guilty since it had the means and motive to copy Masimo’s technology?</p>

<p>Along with a countdown showing the next Unpacked will be on January 17, leaker Evan Blass shared a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-s24-leak-breaks-down-what-the-lineup-likely-has-to-offer-141214873.html">spec sheet</a> that purports to break down the components of the Galaxy S24 lineup. Just like the S23 (pictured above), expect three Galaxy devices: the regular model, an S24+ and an S24 Ultra. All three are slated to run on Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Gen 3.</p>
<p>The leak suggests Samsung will offer Space Zoom of up to 30x and dual telephoto zoom of up to 3x in the Galaxy S24 and S24+, while Ultra will probably have a beefier camera system. If the leak proves true, it will have a 200MP main lens, with up to 10x quad telephoto and 100x Space Zoom.</p>
<p>So far, the Samsung S24 lineup isn’t likely to have any terribly exciting upgrades in designs and pure specs. These are likely to include the company’s own <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsungs-gauss-is-the-gen

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/tesla/"><ins>Tesla</ins></a> has issued a second recall in the US in as many weeks. This time around, it's recalling 120,423 Model S and X vehicles made between 2021 and 2023 due to an issue that may result in an unlocked door unlatching and opening during a crash. According to the <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/vehicle/2022/TESLA/MODEL%252520X#recalls"><ins>National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</ins></a> (NHTSA), this increases the risk of injury and means that the EVs fail to comply with a federal safety regulation. The automaker has already issued a free over-the-air (OTA) update to resolve the problem and owner notification letters are expected to go out in February.</p>

<p>If you'd previously purchased Discovery shows from the PlayStation Store, you can breathe easily now. Sony has <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/legal/psvideocontent/">announced</a> that it's no longer removing shows from the network by December 31 like it had previously planned, thanks to updated licensing agreements. Earlier this month, the company said that it's pulling Discovery shows from PlayStation and is even removing any purchased title from your library due to content licensing agreements with its providers. The Discovery shows available on the PlayStation Store include <em>MythBusters</em>, <em>Deadliest Catch</em> and <em>Cake Boss</em>.</p>
<p>In all, around 1,200 titles would've been affected by the change, and you wouldn’t have gotten a refund for any of them. The announcement came shortly after Warner Bros Discovery, the owner of Discovery Channel, had <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://fortune.com/2023/11/10/warner-bros-discovery-lost-subscribers-

<p>Hyperloop One had once dreamed of building a high-speed freight link <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-06-21-hyperloop-one-moscow-silk-road.html">between Europe and China</a>, one that could take cargo from one end to the other in a single day. That will, however, remain one of the many goals the company won’t be able to fulfill. Hyperloop One is shutting down, a staff member has confirmed to Engadget after <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-12-21/hyperloop-one-to-shut-down-after-raising-millions-to-reinvent-transit?leadSource=uverify%20wall"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> published a report about its closure. It was founded in 2014 following the release of Elon Musk’s paper about his vision for hyperloop transportation technologies.</p>
<p>The company originally aimed to provide transportation for both cargo and people in the form of pods traveling through sealed metal tubes across long distances in airplane-like speeds. From 2017 until 2022, it was known as Virgi
