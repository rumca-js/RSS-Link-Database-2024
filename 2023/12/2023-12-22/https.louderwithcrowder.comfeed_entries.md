It also does not take a genius to know that progressive prosecutors have no interest in prosecuting those who commit crimes. They would much rather go after productive members of society who are just trying to make a living by doing their jobs. Unfortunately, it is becoming far too common that we see authorities going after the victims of crimes rather than the criminals. </p><p><br /></p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

It would collapse if we started having a bunch of “girly men” trying to run things. </p><p>The problem for single women when dating liberal men is that I assume it is no different than dating a “trans woman.” And well, no matter how transphobic that sounds, most women would prefer a masculine man whether they want to admit it or not. </p><p>A liberal woman is going viral on social media after claiming she “felt the feminism leaving her body” just because she went on a date with a “guys guy.” </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
