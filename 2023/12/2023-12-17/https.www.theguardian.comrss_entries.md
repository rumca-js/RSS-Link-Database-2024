He’s bottom of the sales chart, too busy daydreaming up pirate stories to sell football socks and scares off customers by starting sword fights with a pool noodle.

Former Conservative MP, MSP and Scottish Office minister who had an unshakeable commitment to the idea of public service<p>The most remarkable thing about the former Conservative Scottish Office minister James Douglas-Hamilton, who has died aged 81, is that he conducted a successful career, over a period of more than half a century and in four different political assemblies, without ever apparently losing a friend or making an enemy out of his opponents. His ability to traverse the traditional barriers in politics was the more unusual since “Lord James”, as he was universally known, was a scion of the premier dukedom of Scotland and operated in the arena of Scottish politics – one which is not normally noted for any deference to the nobility.</p><p>Douglas-Hamilton was an Edinburgh town councillor before being elected MP for Edinburgh West in October 1974, a seat he held for 23 years until the 1997 election wiped out every Conservative MP in Scotland.

<p>It’s often overlooked and left to its own devices, but should you listen to your gut more, or is it listening to you? Here’s what the science says</p><p>Until fairly recently, the idea of listening to your gut was mostly metaphorical. The heart, lungs and liver are important to keep in good shape. But the stomach, intestines and colon? Surely they just keep chugging along, processing whatever you put into them, occasionally objecting, but basically doing their job.</p><p>Well, not quite. Over the last five years or so, evidence has been piling up that the huge community of microorganisms – bacteria, viruses and fungi – that live in the gut affect everything from the immune system to mental health. We have learned that there are roughly 500m neurons in the human gut, alongside the 100bn in the brain, and research around the “<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6469458/">gut-brain axis</a>” – the biochemical signalling system that links your gastrointestinal tract

<p>My unwanted rail odyssey began in London Waterloo, and ended up showing me how the Tories are failing their voters</p><p>Ten or so days ago, I was embroiled in a truly absurd public transport ordeal. Because the train drivers’ union was going on strike, travelling from the West Country to London for an early start meant driving to Reading, overnighting in a hotel and then taking the Elizabeth line to the capital. Then, on the return journey, the same route came to a halt thanks to a train <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/dec/08/elizabeth-line-passengers-in-london-stranded-after-electric-cables-damaged">colliding with power lines</a>. I was told about this while I was anxiously waiting at Paddington: my only option, it transpired, was to go to Waterloo, and get on a delayed branch-line commuter train – along with hundreds of other people in a similarly depressed and desperate state.</p><p>Most of us had to stand for at least an hour. But from the start of the journ

At 41, I’ve returned to university, an experience which, first time round, totally changed my life. Now I’m one of the oldest students in my year and already in debt, but I’ve discovered a newfound joy for education and the importance of learning<p>Last time I had a first week at university, I successfully shaved a balloon covered in shaving foam without popping it, for which I won shots at the local nightclub, possibly jelly. It is 20 years later, and I am having my first week at university again. This time, I am 41. I am sticking a very strict and detailed timetable to my fridge, making plans for who is going to walk the dog on which days and desperately trying not to say anything that makes me stand out as a late millennial, such as “I used to write all my essays by hand,” and “Wow, literally everything’s online,” both of which came out of my mouth very early on. There are no jelly shots. I am horrified to find that I am constantly on the verge of letting an “in my day…” slip out.

The aristocracy and celebrities are in thrall to medical quackery that while useless can be far from harmless<p>When I hear someone extolling the virtues of homeopathy, I am often reminded of a quotation from the TV show <em>30 Rock</em>. “There are many kinds of intelligence,” Jack Donaghy tells a particularly stupid employee. “Practical, emotional … and then there is actual intelligence, which is what I’m talking about.” Similar, and perhaps correlating, are the many kinds of medicine. Natural, complementary, alternative, homeopathic, herbal, traditional. And then there is actual medicine, which works.</p><p>It is strange that homeopaths can still find employment in 2023, but somehow they do.

My son has set his heart on some new toys for Christmas, but will the big man be listening?<p>‘Dear Santa’ it begins, since my son is still not quite so English that we haven’t managed to keep the preposterous concept of ‘Father Christmas’ away from his blameless mouth. ‘I hope You ARE WELL’ it continues, sounding a charming note of concern that shows him to be a man of impeccable manners.</p><p>Every family that wishes to communicate with St Nicholas has their own tradition for so doing. I knew kids who sent their Christmas letters up the chimney in a puff of smoke. Thence, through a chain of communication too complex for us here to describe, it would find its way to the North Pole and be re-atomised, cinder by cinder, by Santa’s elves.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/dec/17/letters-to-santa-claus">Continue reading...</a>

Nothing beats dipping your hand into a tin of festive chocs at this time of year<p>Who doesn’t love dipping their hand into a tin of chocolate at this time of year? Quality Street is the favourite, but while I love the childhood idea of them, they are just not my cup of tea any more. If they are yours please enjoy them.</p><p>More grownup versions exist with more grownup prices. I have a soft spot for Italian <strong>Venchi</strong>’s offerings. This is in part because some of the chocolates therein remind me of the ubiquitous bowls of sweets and chocs every grownup relative had on their dining-room table. My mother always had one, too, but hers was under the TV, and now my eldest, at university, emulates this on her kitchen table. Venchi’s ‘<a href="https://uk.venchi.com/hamper-with-assorted-chocolates-200-g/5637671123.p" title="">hampers</a>’ (actually round, colourful boxes) start at £25.

At this time of year, food is so much more than just what we eat<p>The Tesco Christmas delivery slots are filling up fast, our sausagey fingers grabbing at space, dragging potatoes into our baskets, and biscuits, and various selections of butter. Our relationship with food alters slightly at this time of year, doesn’t it? It sways and fattens.</p><p>Christmas ads show families literally applauding as a glittering feast appears on their table – this is food as performance, food as trophy, food as glue. A synthetic memory, nostalgia for turkeys past, for dinners when everyone laughed and drank and nobody mentioned the bad thing. Shop-bought sandwiches this month come heavy with mayonnaise and meat, and sprinkled with crispy onions – the idea is that, like Willy Wonka’s Three Course Dinner chewing gum, which gave the illusion you were eating tomato soup, roast beef and blueberry pie, one bite of a Pret Christmas sandwich should not just offer a whole meal, but also transport you far far

Labour has sustained a 20-point poll lead all year, completely confounding Tory hopes of a recovery<p>One member of the cabinet likes to amuse himself at meetings with his civil servants by making ludicrous statements in order to test whether the officials can stop themselves laughing in his face. “In the highly unlikely event that the Conservatives lose the election and Labour forms the next government,” he will begin a sentence and watch as his staff “struggle to stifle their sniggers”.</p><p>The notion that the Tories will be returned to power for what would be a fifth consecutive term has become more snigger-worthy as this year has unfolded. That is the core explanation for the evaporation of Conservative faith in Rishi Sunak and the strengthening of Sir Keir Starmer’s authority over Labour. This was not universally regarded as a given when the year began. Back in January, it was possible to find Tory optimists able to muster a case that Labour’s poll lead would begin to shrivel.

<p>World championship favourite on his ‘stage presence’ secrets and how mental health struggles have improved his darts</p><p>Luke Humphries remembers the day he felted his last roof. It was 1 March 2018: the day before his first UK Open, his first major tournament as a professional. Roofing was in the blood: his father, Mark, worked on the roofs, and so did his brother, Stuart, and ever since leaving school five years earlier so had he. Start at 6am, home at 5pm. But he had always felt a higher calling. At the end of his shift he clocked off, hoping never to clock on again.</p><p>So began a journey that would take Humphries from the roofs of Newbury to the roof of the darting world. On Sunday night, when he begins his world championship campaign, his introduction to the crowd will take a little longer than usual.

So why isn’t more being done?</p><p>Welcome to the Great UTI Scandal, a story of unnecessary suffering for millions, needless hospital admissions, antibiotic resistance, sepsis-related deaths and basic ignorance of the science around female bodies. Women are 30 times more likely to get a urinary tract infection than men, and UTIs are agonising and occasionally fatal. In the past five years, there were 1.8m hospital admissions involving UTIs in England alone, plus even more GP appointments. This is not just a gender health gap – it’s a dangerous crevasse. But is there another way?</p><p><em>“Killer UTIs! Kept getting them, doctors were dismissive and directing me to chemist treatments, so gave up with them.

<p>The British photographer’s series of painterly images of American street intersections convey a powerful sense of uncertainty</p><p>Decisions, decisions. The stage sets for Oli Kellett’s book, <em>Cross Road Blues</em>, are the pedestrian crossings on American city streets. His pictures feature people held at “Don’t Walk” signs for a few seconds, as here, wondering exactly which way to turn.</p><p>The idea for the work came to Kellett, who is British and based in Hastings, on a visit to the US before the 2016 elections. He was staying on Hope Street in Los Angeles, and there seemed an uneasy resonance in that name at the end of the Obama years. One late afternoon, Kellett saw, from high up, a woman standing at the roadside waiting for a green light to cross a large intersection. The grid pattern of the street, the softening afternoon sun which cast the woman in a natural spotlight all seemed to dramatise something of that uncertain political mood.

Bring seasonal cheer to your table with these fragrant delights<p>When I initially thought about festive scent, eau de toilettes/parfums crossed my mind. But does anyone actually want to smell “festive”? How does that translate? A mulled wine cologne? Ugh. Also, what’s the point of a fragrance you only wear once a year? So, instead, I’ve focussed on the scents we want to be surrounded by, as opposed to those we want to exude. Hence festive candles. What I like about these is they look lovely – your table setting will be a conversation starter – but smell exquisite, too, though not in a way that is so overpowering you begin to taste it in the gravy. This is because these candles were, mostly, created by perfumers – or in industry parlance, noses – who understand the alchemy of fragrance. They are at the top of the game when it comes to putting notes together and knowing how they will work in real settings. So their luxe scents are beautifully complementary as opposed to clashing.
