With 2023 in our rearview mirror and 2024 looming large, it’s that time of year again where we look back at the year that’s been- and what a year it’s been. It’s hard to think of many years that have been as packed full of incredible new games as this one has been. 

Over the course of the last twelve months, we’ve had the good fortune of enjoying a steady stream of veritable instant classics, games ranging across all genres, coming from developers big and small, and strengthening the libraries of all platforms on the market. 

Here, our objective is to look back and pick out the ones that we feel stood out above all the others, so join us as we talk about our favorite games of 2023, including the one we felt was the brightest start among them all- our game of the year.
