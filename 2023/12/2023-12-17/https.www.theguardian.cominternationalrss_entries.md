But, in now typical fashion, Smith shakes his head as if the world has wronged him, and trudges off at a snail’s pace, holding the bat by the blade with a look of fury in his eye. It’s high time the Australian hierarchy did something about this. Great bowling, Shahzad joining the dots into a wicket. Smith only has himself to blame.</p><p>Shahzad continues to probe at Smith, almost inducing a play-on, then finding some seam movement back into the right-hander, smacking into the front pad and getting Joel Wilson to raise his fi
