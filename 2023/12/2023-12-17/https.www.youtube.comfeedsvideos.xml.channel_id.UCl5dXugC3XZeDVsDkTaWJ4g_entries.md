In this video, you'll witness an encounter with a tour guide who has a deep connection to India. Also, discover the charm of Trinidad, a must-visit destination in Cuba.  Additionally, you'll get insights into the cost of Airbnb accommodations in Cuba, ensuring a budget-friendly travel experience. The local host family warmly invited me into their home, offering a unique glimpse into Cuban life. The bus trip took me to Trinidad, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Its cobblestone streets, pastel-coloured colonial buildings, and vibrant cultural scene transport you back to a bygone era. #Trinidad #Cuba #MountainTrekker
