<p>Moayad Salami crossed from Russia after treacherous journey from Syria – but now the border has closed</p><p>Moayad Salami left his destroyed home city of Homs a month ago for Russia. Despite having heard horror stories of beatings en route – a friend had had his leg broken – and failed attempts to cross the border, the 36-year-old Syrian’s plan was to go to Poland via Belarus to seek safety for himself and his family in the EU.</p><p>But when Salami got to Moscow, a smuggler on Telegram informed him that a safer and easier route had opened up. For $3,000 (£2,400), he was told, he could get straight to Finland. No boats or beatings by border guards. All he had to do was get to St Petersburg and the rest would be taken care of.

<p><strong>Shaftesbury theatre, London<br /></strong>Hi-vis hijinks are here aplenty as the Britain’s Got Talent winner revisits his triumphant routines</p><p>It’s been quite the year for Viggo Venn. Twelve months ago, he tells us, he was playing in a pub across the street to a crowd of 14 people. Tonight, he’s filled a West End theatre with fans who love him for Britain’s Got Talent, on which <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/aug/01/britains-got-talent-viggo-venn-edinburgh-tiktok-bgt-clown">the Norwegian clown</a> gambolled to victory in a fluorescent vest.

<p>After fleeing Togo in 1992 and being separated from her husband, the artist spent almost two decades in the netherworld to which those without an official immigration status are confined</p><p>Hélène Amouzou’s story is hard to stomach. She was forced to flee her home country, Togo, in 1992, as years of political turbulence erupted into protests and violence. Her husband’s political affiliations put them in danger – they, like hundreds of thousands of Togolese, ended up in Benin, Toga’s eastern neighbour. From there, the couple and their infant daughter went to Germany to seek asylum, but soon after their arrival, found their name on a deportation list. When Amouzou’s husband went to attend a registration appointment, he never returned. Amouzou and her young daughter went into hiding.</p><p>Amouzou eventually returned to Benin to search for her husband, not realising the German government had sent him back to Togo. In the autumn of 1997, she decided to return to Europe, but this ti

<p>Was Bristol University giving into ‘woke ideology’, or simply cutting the least good song from an overlong ceremony?</p><p>The University of Bristol has dropped the UK national anthem from its graduation ceremony programme, and will now play it only when a member of the royal family is present. This seems like a polite compromise, with the anthem being the equivalent of a carriage clock that you only put on display when the person who gave it to you comes round for tea. No offence given, and everybody’s happy.</p><p>Of course not everybody is happy. The Sun claimed “university bosses have been accused of hating British culture and pandering to wokes”.

<p>Have Chelsea been found out, can Malard fill Russo’s shoes as United’s No 9 and Terland hits the top of the scoring charts</p><p>The Arsenal centre-back Lotte Wubben-Moy said her side had proved a point with their impressive 4-1 defeat of Chelsea at the Emirates in front of a record 59,042 fans. “We don’t really listen to sceptics but there was a narrative at the beginning of the season about Arsenal selling out and attracting crowds but not winning,” she said. “Today sets the tone for what we are about and the intensity we want to bring. We do that with the fans and that’s how important that relationship is.” Arsenal’s performance was dominant but Chelsea’s capitulation was equally notable. Emma Hayes’s side did not have the answer to Arsenal’s fast and high press and went into the break two goals down at 3-1. Tactically, they were left wanting.

Pioli’s Milan did not draw with Atalanta, losing instead to a magnificently mischievous backheel by Luis Muriel. It was their fifth defeat in the last 10 games.</p><p>The scores were level in Bergamo heading into injury time. Then Milan’s captain, Davide Calabria, was sent off for a second yellow card.

His wandering mind is awakened to new desires by the arrival of William (Julien De Saint Jean), a detainee with a penchant for breaking rules. While physical escape remains elusive, the mutual attraction between the two boys forms a means of emotional rescue.</p><p>Imbued with red-hot passion as well as tenderness, their intense bond defies the system of rules and surveillance that governs their every move. The days now come not only with tasks and lessons, but also kisses and embraces. At night, the lovesick pair press their bodies close to the wall that separates th

<p>Bumper harvest celebrated in Russia can be explained by ‘looting’ of occupied territory, say prosecutors</p><p>Russia’s farmers are achieving record grain harvests – according to official figures. But the numbers published by Vladimir Putin’s government appear to conceal the contribution to this bumper crop made by another set of farmers: those in occupied Ukraine.</p><p>Ukrainian officials and agriculture experts have claimed that favourable conditions are not enough to explain the giant harvest. They say instead that Ukrainian grain is being exported disguised as Russian produce.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/11/forged-documents-how-ukrainian-grain-may-be-enriching-putins-circle">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Our small terrace house wasn’t set up for a trio of honking hooligans, but my mum couldn’t resist adopting them. The neighbours were less than pleased, though</p><p>My first dependant was a duck called Mr Kite. As a cream-faced four-year-old, it was my job at the nursery to turn the eggs in the incubator every day: one side noughts, the other side crosses, so we could tell them apart. In years since, this ovum-flipping responsibility has been interpreted as early evidence of a maternal instinct. That may be overegging it a bit.</p><p>We lived in a small, inner-city terrace house in east Oxford at the time. We had a long, thin garden. Both my parents worked. And yet, as a gentle-hearted vet’s daughter, my mum couldn’t resist adopting these fowl.

The devotion it inspired among its fans finally convinced British commissioners that there is mainstream appetite for authentic onscreen depictions of Black life.

<p>In a season where even the best teams have flaws, the veteran quarterback only needs to be competent when he has a brilliant defense backing him up</p><p>When the NFL season started, Joe Flacco watched it like most of us: from the couch. Unsigned coming into the season, the 38-year-old stayed in shape and threw with his brother just in case an offer came along. But he was mostly shifting his focus toward a coaching career.</p><p>Then the Cleveland Browns called after their $230m man Deshaun Watson went down with a season-ending shoulder injury.

<p>When I moved to a new city, I relied on a phone screen to guide me from A to B. But finding my own way opened my eyes</p><p>In August this year I moved to Bristol. After spending most of my life living in villages or small towns, being constantly surrounded by the busyness of a city was a shock. Not owning a bike and not wanting to be reliant on Bristol’s very creaky bus system, I walked everywhere. Almost automatically I used Google Maps to help me. Whereas on a traditional paper map I would first have had to locate relevant landmarks and street names before positioning myself within the map’s landscape, the blue dot on my screen showed me exactly where I was. The procession of smaller blue dots stretching out to my destination revealed the fastest way to get there. I arrived at things mostly on time, and was very rarely lost.</p><p>However, the more I used Google Maps, the more unsettled I felt. I often find inspiration for my writing as I walk. That can come from things I notic

<p>Liverpool go top, Chelsea seem to need even more financial backing, and no one wants to bet against Villa</p><p>The bad news for Luton is that they’ve already played the (notional) best three teams in the league at home. In the past five weeks, they’ve drawn with Liverpool, lost 4-3 to Arsenal to a 97th-minute winner, and gone down to a narrow 2-1 defeat to Manchester City. In all three games they’ve gone ahead. Playing the elite clearly suits Rob Edwards’ side. The issue is whether they can produce that quality of performance against lesser sides. They beat Crystal Palace 2-1 at home during that run, and that has to be the model. Playing a 3-4-3 gives them plenty of crossing options – and Andros Townsend remains a very fine deliverer of a ball, as he proved in laying on Elijah Adebayo’s goal against City – and they have the physicality to take advantage. The worry is that they are now four points adrift, even with Everton’s points deduction; they could do with finding some of the

<p><strong>The Egg theatre, Bath<br /></strong>Gaming imagery blends with traditional adventure scenery in an exuberant present-day adaptation of JM Barrie’s novel</p><p>Within a fortnight of Wendy’s birth, JM Barrie has Mr and Mrs Darling calculating household expenses to see if they can afford to keep her. It’s played for comedy in the novel – much like the couple making a Newfoundland dog their nurse because a nanny is too pricey. But James Baldwin’s new, loose adaptation for over-sixes puts the modern-day cost of living front and centre. A bill is stuffed through the door of a shabby kitchen set (Anisha Fields’s design), where a daunting to-do list is pinned on the family fridge.</p><p>Wendy (Liana Cottrill) and Jon Michael (JoAnne Haines) are being raised by their mum (Rozelle Gemma). Wendy is bullied at school and overloaded at home so, freaky as it is to discover Peter Pan (Joseph Tweedale) in the fridge, she agrees to accompany him and Tink (Alice Lamb) to the Neverland.</p>

<p>Young people trust social media above politicians when it comes to the Israel-Hamas war. Is it any wonder, given the kind of politics they have grown up with?</p><p>In a famous two-frame meme from The Simpsons, Principal Skinner asks himself: “Am I so out of touch?” “No,” he decides, with resolve. “It’s the children who are wrong.” It’s the easiest thing, dismissing the views of young people when they question our beliefs. It’s even easier when those views are mainly expressed on a social media platform that can also be dismissed as a lawless land of misinformation and clickbaiting. And so as Palestine- and Gaza-related content explodes on TikTok, predictable responses have arrived, and some have been pretty out there.</p><p>The Republican presidential contender Nikki Haley called for the banning of TikTok altogether when she <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/dec/07/nikki-haley-tiktok-antisemitism-hamas">said in a primary campaign debate</a> last week that “for eve

In 1978, when she was 28, Nyad attempted to swim from Cuba to Florida, a 54-hour-plus journey through waters riddled with jellyfish, the sting of which was so strong it was like being electrocuted. She was forced to abort, having completed 76 miles, only some of them in a straight line.</p><p>Thirty-two years later, Nyad started training for a second attempt. While sports psychologists note that mental resilience is a bigger factor than physical strength in long-distance swimming, it was still, objectively, a ridiculous idea.
