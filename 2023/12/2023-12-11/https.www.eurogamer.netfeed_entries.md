Fntastic, the developer behind controversial Steam Early Access launch The Day Before, has shut down with immediate effect. 
</p><p>
A <a href="https://twitter.com/FntasticHQ/status/1734265789237338453">statement</a> posted to X, formerly Twitter, announced the company's closure - just days after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-day-befores-overwhelmingly-negative-steam-reviews-seem-deserved">The Day Before launched to overwhelmingly negative response</a> last week. 
</p><p>
In its statement, Fntastic said The Day Before had "failed financially, and we lack the funds to continue. All income received is being used to pay off debts to our partners".

TimeSplitters developer Free Radical Design closed its doors today,  staff are now reporting via social media.
</p><p>
Photos and messages from Free Radical Design team members are now filtering onto X, formerly Twitter, as staff say farewell to the Nottingham-based studio.
</p><p>
This version of Free Radical Design was founded in 2021 to revive the TimeSplitters series, with various former staff members from the original games brought on board. But <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-owned-time-splitters-studio-free-radical-reportedly-facing-closure">recent reports suggested it was now set for closure</a> as part of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saints-row-owner-embracer-announces-comprehensive-restructuring-program-to-close-studios-cut-jobs">t

Every week, I like to choose one specific topic to discuss from the latest edition of DF Direct Weekly - and there's certainly an embarrassment of riches to choose from in another vast episode. We sat down to film our 141th show the morning after The Game Awards, and despite the usual downplaying of expectations from Geoff Keighley, the 'wurld prm'ears' came thick and fast. For this blog though, it's actually a supporter question that prompts this article. DF Supporter Julian Sniter asked us whether upscaling technologies like AMD's FSR and Epic's TSR are making it harder for us to <a href="https://youtu.be/3ra-P3gH7Dg">'count pixels'</a> and ascertain native resolutions. The answer is yes, but the more verbose answer is that upscaling technologies h

Epic Games is still keen for its rapidly-growing gaming metaverse to include characters from the world of Nintendo - but it has also acknowledged that securing characters from the Mario maker in Fortnite has proven extremely difficult.
</p><p>
"I don't know what the word for, like, making diamonds is," Epic Games' Saxs Persson said when asked by <a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-gaming">Axios</a> how hard it had been.
</p><p>
"Nintendo has their strategy and we have our strategy, and we hope at some point" to use their characters, Persson continued. "Our players would love it."

Baldur's Gate 3 developer Larian has said that Xbox players should manually update their consoles to combat instances where game crashes make save files disappear.
</p><p>
Larian made the announcement today via a <a href="https://twitter.com/baldursgate3/status/1734209268612526260">post</a> on X, formerly Twitter, in which the studio said it had also pushed a small update live for Baldur's Gate 3 on Xbox that contained "stability fixes".
</p><p>
"We're aware of saves disappearing after a crash," Larian continued. "An update is available from Xbox to help with some of these issues, please manually update your Xbox through the system menu."

Survival horror fans have been treated in recent years with the revival of classic games in the genre. Resident Evil has led the charge, with the likes of Dead Space and Silent Hill following. Now, developer Pieces Interactive and publisher THQ Nordic hope their Alone in the Dark reimagining can follow suit, and deliver a fresh-feeling experience for a modern audience while sticking closer to the survival horror genre's roots than perhaps we've seen recently.
</p><p>
This point was one producers Andreas Schmiedecker and Michael Paeck were keen to emphasise during an early look at the game a couple of weeks ago. As I was shown snippets of the game through a hands-off demo, two key tenets of survival horror were highlighted: non-linear exploration and puzzle solving, and linear combat sectio

Fortnite Festival - the game's new rhythm-based mode developed by Rock Band studio Harmonix - will let you use your plastic guitars and drums in the future. 
</p><p>
Adding support for instrument controllers is "a priority", according to an FAQ page for the mode published by Epic Games. 
</p><p>
Fortnite Festival went live on Saturday, and lets you tap along to music using buttons on your controller or keyboard (as in, a keyboard for your PC). It is very like Rock Band, which is perhaps not surprising, with tracks available for different instruments and with various difficulty options.

## Christopher Judge's Call of Duty campaign joke didn't land with some developers

God of War actor Christopher Judge made another memorable appearance at last week's The Game Awards, this time to present an award rather than receive one - and to make a joke at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warzone-best-guns-meta-mw3-warzone-9328">Modern Warfare 3</a>'s expense.
</p><p>
(Or perhaps he never really left the stage, and simply continued last year's infamously-long acceptance speech?)
</p><p>
This year, Judge raised eyebrows and prompted sounds of shock from the audience when he compared the length of his 2022 speech to this year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/modern-warfare-3-players-are-not-happy-with-its-short-campaign">short Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 campaign</a>. "My speech was actually longer," he joked.

Donald Mustard, of Fortnite, Infinity Blade and Shadow Complex, once told me something very interesting about games that I've been turning over ever since. He was talking about the difference between designing something like Shadow Complex and designing something like Infinity Blade. 
</p><p>
The difference, he made it sound - the main difference - was where the player sat. When they fire up Shadow Complex, they're on the sofa in front of the big TV. They've maybe cleared a chunk of time, made themselves a drink. As a designer you can feel that have the player for quite a while. With Infinity Blade, though, well, where are they? On the bus? Waiting at the deli? Sitting at the dentist? You don't have them as long - you can't guarantee that you have as much of their attent
