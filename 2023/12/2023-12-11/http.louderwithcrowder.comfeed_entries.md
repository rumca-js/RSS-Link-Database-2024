Djokovic made a personal medical choice not to get the SCMOVID schmaccine. It led to him getting deported from one country and banned from another. </p><p>Djokovic was asked about the controversy, which manages to be more insane looking back on it now, by <em>60 Minutes</em>. I don't think the interviewer meant it to be funny when he asked if Djokovic misread the Australian people who "don't believe in
