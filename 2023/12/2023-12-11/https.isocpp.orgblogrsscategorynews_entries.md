	From the article:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
		All data flow inspections rely on the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control-flow_graph" rel="noopener" target="_blank">control-flow graph</a>. This is a graph on which vertices are the statements in the program and edges are the control flow jumps between these statements (direct code execution, conditional jumps, loops, breaks, gotos, etc.).</p>
