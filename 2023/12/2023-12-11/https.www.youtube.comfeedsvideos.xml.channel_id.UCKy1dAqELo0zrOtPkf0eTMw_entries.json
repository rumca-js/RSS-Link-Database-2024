Gathering those resources is made more difficult since your weapons and mining equipment break quickly.

Again, this does go against the intended way to play Lego Fortnite, so skip this video if you want to maintain a pure experience. But if you want to cheese your way into getting resources a bit faster, then this video is for you!
