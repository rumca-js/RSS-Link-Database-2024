A spacecraft the size of a cereal box has collected precise measurements of the atmospheres of large and puffy planets called "hot Jupiters." The findings, led by a team from the University of Colorado Boulder, could help reveal how the atmospheres around these and a host of other worlds are escaping into space.

The American Southwest has always been a dry place—cue romantic visions of hot, rugged, sun-bleached, seemingly infinite landscapes and star-filled night skies. And yet, the plants, animals and people of the Four Corners region (Utah, Colorado, New Mexico and Arizona) have managed to adapt to and even flourish in the land of low rainfall and high temperatures.

In December 2022, NASA's MAVEN (Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN) mission observed the dramatic and unexpected "disappearance" of a stream of charged particles constantly emanating off the sun, known as the solar wind. This was caused by a special type of solar event that was so powerful, it created a void in its wake as it traveled through the solar system.

Natural resource management decisions in protected areas impact more than the wildlife and landscapes they're charged to conserve. They also affect neighbors, who could otherwise hunt, build, or engage in recreation as they choose on their own land. For decades, community members primarily voiced their opinions through brief and impersonal public comment periods. But an initiative led by environmental social scientists at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign is putting a new spin on neighborly communication.

Under complex temperature variations, the irreversible thermal expansion of polymer-bonded explosives (PBXs) containing 1,3,5-triamino-2,4,6-trinitrobenzene (TATB) leads to diminished shape stability. This, in turn, directly impacts the mechanical properties and safety performance during storage and use. In recent years, extensive and thorough research has been conducted to investigate the thermal expansion characteristics of TATB-based explosives.

Prof. Bernd Plietker and his research group at the Chair of Organic Chemistry I at TUD have specifically developed a class of natural substances—polyprenylated polycyclic acylphloroglucinols (PPAP for short). Due to its properties, the resulting derivative PPAP53 is characterized by great potential for application in a medicinal chemistry context. In collaboration with several research institutions, such as the Universities of Ulm and Mainz, it has been shown that PPAP53 is very promising in the fight against multi-resistant tuberculosis and opens up new treatment perspectives for neurodegenerative diseases.

The yield of wheat crops is influenced by sink strength (grain number and nutrient absorption capacity) and source capacity (photosynthetic tissue efficiency).

The mystery of aging has fascinated people for millennia, with many willing to do anything to halt or reverse this process, because aging is typically associated with gradual deterioration of most body functions. While senescence is a natural part of life, biologists understand surprisingly little about the emergence of this process during evolution.

Some may know suckermouth armored catfish as "window cleaners" from aquariums because they possess a suckermouth, which allows them to attach to various surfaces. The attachment is not only enabled by a vacuum created by the fish but also by specific structures of their mouths, which enable an interlocking and adhering to surfaces. A team of researchers closely examined these unique suckermouths and summarized their findings in a recent study published in Frontiers in Zoology.

A new study has identified a potentially growing natural hazard in the north: frostquakes. With climate change contributing to many observed changes in weather extremes, such as heavy precipitation and cold waves, these seismic events could become more common. Researchers were surprised by the role of wetlands and drainage channels in irrigated wetlands in origin of frostquakes.

## Researchers: Frozen methane under the seabed is thawing as oceans warm, and things are worse than we thought

Buried beneath the oceans surrounding continents is a naturally occurring frozen form of methane and water. Sometimes dubbed "fire-ice" as you can literally set light to it, marine methane hydrate can melt as the climate warms, uncontrollably releasing methane—a potent greenhouse gas—into the ocean and possibly the atmosphere.

## Seaweed farming environments do not always function as CO₂ sinks, study finds

Under climate scenarios, seaweed farming is now used globally as a promising approach for achieving carbon neutrality. Seaweed farming contributes substantial amounts of organic carbon to the ocean, part of which can be locked for a long time in the ocean and function as ocean carbon sequestration, and the other part can be converted to inorganic carbon through microbial mineralization and aerobic respiration, affecting the seawater carbonate system and carbon dioxide (CO2) sink/source effects (note that CO2 sink ≠ carbon sequestration).

Plastic is one of the important materials in modern society, with approximately 460 million tons produced annually and with expected production reaching approximately 1.23 billion tons in 2060. However, since 1950, plastic waste totaling more than 6.3 billion tons has been generated, and it is believed that more than 140 million tons of plastic waste has accumulated in the aquatic environment.

The Milky Way is a spiral galaxy. More specifically, it is a barred spiral galaxy, meaning that within its central region, there is a bar shape off of which the spirals emanate. About two-thirds of spiral galaxies are barred spirals, and astronomers have thought this difference is just a variance in how density waves cluster stars in a galaxy. But a new study suggests that the bar of the Milky Way may have been caused by an ancient collision with another galaxy.

Most of the times astronomers reported dramatic, cataclysmic events like neutron star mergers or the creation of a black hole; they are taking place light years away, typically in in another galaxy. While we can observe their destructive power through the light they emit, they have minimal impact on Earth. However, a relatively recent discovery of certain types of isotopes at the bottom of the ocean hints at one of these events happening fairly close to home. And it probably didn't happen all that long ago.

In the western United States, this is no different, as irrigated farming is the leading driver of water depletion in the region. In addition, climate change has caused it to become increasingly difficult for the western United States to meet the water needs of farms, cities and ecosystems.
