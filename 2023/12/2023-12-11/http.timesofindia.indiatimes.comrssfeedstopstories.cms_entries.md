The Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) is urging the Indian government to adopt a bill similar to the one proposed in the US Congress. The bill, called the Lowering Broadband Costs for Consumers Act of 2023, aims to make large internet apps contribute to infrastructure costs in order to lower broadband costs for consumers. It also proposes that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) mandate social media platforms, streaming services, and other edge service providers to contribute to a universal fund for building networks. The bill classifies various services including social media platforms, streaming services, video gaming services, and search engines under edge service providers. COAI believes that this bill supports their stance and wants only large traffic generators to contribute to infrastructure costs in India.

Lenders determine loan amounts based on credit scores, multiplier method, DTI ratio, EMI/NMI ratio, and LTV ratio. Borrowers with good credit may qualify for higher loan amounts. Lenders multiply net monthly income by a factor to determine personal loan amounts. A lower DTI ratio and EMI/NMI ratio enhance eligibility for higher loan amounts. The LTV ratio helps evaluate risk and set terms and conditions. Lenders prioritize factors differently, and criteria can vary based on loan type and policies. Borrowers should understand the loan approval process and regulatory requirements.
