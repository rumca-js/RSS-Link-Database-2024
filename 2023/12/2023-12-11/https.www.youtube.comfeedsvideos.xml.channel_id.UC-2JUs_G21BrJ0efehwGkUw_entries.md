Exciting news! Scary Pockets is pivoting towards making ORIGINAL MUSIC.

This desire to create original music has been burning in our hearts for some time, and we're thrilled to share it with you. As we embark on this exciting new chapter, we will be taking a hiatus from posting new cover songs. 

What's Coming Next?
While we work diligently on crafting our original music, we're also spicing things up on our Patreon page. Get ready for fresh perks, exclusive behind-the-scenes content, and more fun ways to keep us in your pocket.
Thank you for being the heartbeat of Scary Pockets. Your support has helped us to employ a whole team of amazing folks and work with the greatest musicians on the planet. We can't wait to share this new stuff with you. Stay tuned for more updates! 

Luv you all ðŸ™Œ
