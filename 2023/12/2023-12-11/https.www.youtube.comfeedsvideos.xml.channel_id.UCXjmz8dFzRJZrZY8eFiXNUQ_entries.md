American television networks remaking British sitcoms is not a new strategy.  Sometimes, like in the case of The Office, it can work out better than expected. In the case of The IT Crowd, it went horribly wrong.  The original IT Crowd is immensely popular both in the US and UK, and for good reason. The American reboot of The IT Crowd missed the mark on almost every level.  So much so the network decided to turn off The IT Crowd without turning them back on.
