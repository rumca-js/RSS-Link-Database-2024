Peterson sits down with historian and author Niall Ferguson. They discuss the historical and deeply mythological precedent of world-ending narratives, how the global doomsday ethos abdicates local responsibility while empowering the elite class, the out-of-control gigantism plaguing our administrative states today, and how we might strive to deal with genuine tragedy morally, religiously, and with humility.\n\nNiall Ferguson is a Scottish-American historian, author, columnist, TV presenter, and academic. He is the Milbank Family Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution of Stanford University, as well as a senior fellow at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard University. Ferguson has written many books, such as \u201cEmpire: How Britain Made the Modern World,\u201d \u201cColossus: The Rise and Fall of the American Empire,\u201d \u201cThe Square and the Tower,\u201d and most recently, \u201cDoom: The Politics of Catastrophe,\u201d which has been shortlisted for the Lionel Gelber prize", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZn55uYytd0", "date_published": "2023-12-11T22:00:12+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "Jordan B Peterson", "album": "Jordan B Peterson", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/RZn55uYytd0/hqdefault.jpg", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}]
