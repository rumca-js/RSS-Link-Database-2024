Lego Fortnite is a game all about gathering TONS of resources to build structures and survive. Gathering those resources is made more difficult since your weapons and mining equipment break quickly. This is a core mechanic to games like Lego Fortnite and Minecraft as it helps prevent you from gathering resources too quickly, but what if we told you there's an incredibly easy way to repair your weapons and equipment? Again, this does go against the intended way to play Lego Fortnite, so skip this video if you want to maintain a pure experience. But if you want to cheese your way into getting resources a bit faster, then this video is for you! Just remember, exploits like this are likely to get patched out quickly, so if you watched this video but its not working, there's a good chance Fortnite already patched it out!
