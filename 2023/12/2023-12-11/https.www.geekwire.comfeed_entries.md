As we&#8217;ve reported, the online retailer is shutting down three offices, including its Seattle headquarters, and laying off more than 800 people. The company, owned by private equity firm Regent, announced a &#8220;going-out-of-business&#8221; sale this past weekend. The collapse has shocked and saddened longtime employees, many of whom describe their time at Zulily as formative periods in their careers. It&#8217;s a stunning turn of events for a business that was once a cornerstone of Seattle&#8217;s tech industry, valued at more than $7 billion. Over the weekend, we caught up with Mark&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/zulily-had-better-days-co-founder-mark-vadon-shares-startup-lessons-from-the-online-retailer/">Read More</a>

The pace of advancement has been little short of astounding, with OpenAI — and its high-profile partnership with Microsoft — taking much of the attention after its launch late last year. Google last week raised the stakes with the unveiling of its latest generative AI model, Gemini, a joint effort of Google Brain and DeepMind and a direct competitor to OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Google, which has a large engineering presence in the Seattle area, is promoting Gemini as natively multimodal.

The AFL-CIO and Microsoft said the agreement includes a &#8220;neutrality framework&#8221; that will apply to future efforts by workers to organize under affiliated unions. They said the framework confirms &#8220;a joint commitment to respect the right of employees to form or join unions, to develop positive and cooperative labor-management relationships, and&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/microsoft-tries-to-address-ai-labor-concerns-with-new-afl-cio-pact-and-neutrality-framework/">Read More</a>
