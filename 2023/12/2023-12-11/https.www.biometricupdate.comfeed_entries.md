		The <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/worldcoin">Worldcoin</a> Foundation, originator of would-be world digital currency of the future WLD, could use a little scratch.

Executives want to raise up to $50 million, selling its WLD tokens to investors for $1 each, as noted by trade publication <a href="https://bitcoinke.io/2023/12/worldcoin-looking-to-raise-funding-from-discounted-token-sale/">BitcoinKE</a>. The publication claims executives have been shopping the token around for weeks.

Most recently, WLD has been going for $2.50. What the funding would address, other than getting fresh blood in the WLD pool, is not known.

The move would address any ambitious cybercurrency's need – <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202312/worldcoin-turns-to-pe

Now, the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) has been told to ensure the digital ID program registrars adhere to those rules so that no one is left behind.

Union Minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar recently directed that steps be taken to enroll one Josymol P Jose in Kerala who was unable to provide fingerprints.

		After a three-day <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202312/ai-act-stumbles-over-provisional-deal-with-biometrics-among-main-culprits">marathon negotiation</a>, the European Union has finally reached a provisional agreement on the Artificial Intelligence Act.

Late Friday, the European Council and Parliament settled their disputes on the first major framework governing AI, including the use of biometric surveillance by law enforcement, which proved one of the largest stumbling blocks. The final agreement also bans some kinds of biometric categorization and makes online images off-limits for facial recognition databases.

“It was long and intense, but the effort was worth it,” the AI Act’s co-rapporteur Brando Benifei says in a statement.
