There is an energy to Embark Studios' The Finals that's missing from the competitive shooter scene. Perhaps it's the style and the presentation. Maybe it's the gameplay and unique mechanics or the environmental destruction.

Wherever you may fall, there's no denying that The Finals is a fun time. The blend of fluid gunplay with fast-paced movement and objective-based maps makes for high-stakes combat, whether you're messing around or invested in the outcome. Even the optimization and netcode are smooth, with little to no issues.

The Finals isn't without its issues - the map pool may feel too small, and the tutorial leaves much to be desired. However, its foundation is solid, and I can't wait to see how Embark builds on it in the future.

You've heard it before, and it bears repeating - this year has been excellent for video games. There have been top-tier blockbusters, unforgettable sequels, long-awaited releases and several stellar indie games.

Of course, you have to take the bad with the good, and 2023 was full of some real stinkers. From Xbox exclusives like Redfall to PlayStation exclusives like Forspoken and underwhelming titles with solid starts like The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria and Quantum Error to terrible launches like The Last of Us Part 1 on PC and Payday 3, the disappointments were varied and extensive.

Not even Sonic the Hedgehog was safe despite a hot streak of solid releases. Here are our picks for the 15 most disappointing games of 2023.

The first paid DLC for Final Fantasy 16, Echoes of the Fallen, is available now for PS5 players. As someone who enjoyed the base game immensely despite its faults, it was exciting to see this new DLC suddenly drop out of nowhere.

If you're someone in it for combat, maybe some new and gorgeous environments, then the DLC will satisfy you. However, for those expecting a more impactful setting, new dungeon mechanics or something more impactful, you might want to adjust expectations accordingly. 

It isn't to say that Echoes of the Fallen isn't worth playing, but I certainly expected something a bit more.
