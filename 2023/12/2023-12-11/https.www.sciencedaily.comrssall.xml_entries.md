Caffeine can have a negative impact on football players' decision-making skills, new research shows. A study has found that while consuming caffeine before a game can improve the accuracy of football passes, it can have an adverse effect on more tactical play involving a higher number of passes.

## New conductive, cotton-based fiber developed for smart textiles

A single strand of newly developed fiber has the flexibility of cotton and the electric conductivity of the polymer, polyaniline. The new material has shown good potential for wearable e-textiles. The researchers tested the fibers with a system that powered an LED light and another that sensed ammonia gas. While intrinsically conductive, polyaniline is brittle and by itself, cannot be made into a fiber for textiles. To solve this, the researchers dissolved cotton cellulose from recycled t-shirts into a solution and the conductive polymer into another separate solution.

A number of diseases are caused by proteins that have spun out of control. Unfortunately, so far, conventional drugs have been able to stop only a fraction of these troublemakers. A new class of drugs known as PROTACs holds great promise in pharmaceutical research. They mark proteins for targeted degradation by the cell's own protein disposal system.

## Non-invasive technology for the high-throughput characterization of cancer cells

The electrical properties of cancer cells can provide information on their cancer type, state, and drug resistance. However, conventional platforms to measure these properties are complex and can only analyze a few cells. Researchers have successfully developed a high-throughput device that measures the electrical properties of cancer cells through continuous flow electrorotation. The new platform offers a high degree of automation and can simultaneously analyze several cells.

## Science sheds light on shaking your holiday presents

As holidays near, people are sneaking shakes of their presents to try to figure out what they're getting. But present shakers might be a little less sly than they think. New research shows it's incredibly easy for people watching others shake boxes to tell what they're up to. 'There are few things more delightful than seeing a child's eyes light up as they pick up a present and wonder what might be inside,' said author Chaz Firestone, a Johns Hopkins University assistant professor of psychological and brain sciences who investigates how vision and thought interact. 'What our work shows is that your mind is able to track the information they are seeking. Just as they might be able to tell what's inside the box by shaking it around, you can tell what they are trying to figure out when they shake it.'

It may feel unforgivably rude to reject an invitation -- even one to an event you would much prefer not to attend -- but people often overestimate the social consequences of saying no, according to new research.

## Study reveals a protein called snail may play a role in healing brain injury

## Nature and animal emojis don't accurately represent natural biodiversity

The current emoji library doesn't accurately represent the 'tree of life' and the breadth of biodiversity seen in nature according to a new analysis. A team of conservation biologists categorized emojis related to nature and animals and mapped them onto the phylogenetic tree of life. They found that animals are well represented by the current emoji catalog, whereas plants, fungi, and microorganisms are poorly represented. Within the animal kingdom, vertebrates were over-represented while arthropods were underrepresented with respect to their actual biodiversity.

## Potential new treatment for pulmonary neuroendocrine tumors

Medical researchers found a way to grow samples of different types of neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) in the lab. While generating their new model, the researchers discovered that some pulmonary NETs need the protein EGF to be able to grow. These types of tumors may therefore be treatable using inhibitors of the EGF receptor.
