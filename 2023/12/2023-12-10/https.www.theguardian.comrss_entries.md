<p>This pacy, extremely good crime drama tackles a murder on a military base in its second season. It’s a thrilling watch that’s full of political truth bombs – and a great performance from Jones</p><p>Remember Vigil, the BBC One crime drama in which Suranne Jones was trapped in a submarine? Jones played DCI Amy Silva, a police detective who was assigned to investigate a mysterious death aboard a submarine, then became trapped inside it, locked in with all the suspects and the killer. Meanwhile, her colleague and lost true love, DS Kirsten Longacre (Rose Leslie), helped to probe the case on the Scottish mainland, all the while worried her rightful life partner was trapped in a submarine.</p><p>Thanks to the ingenious tension-tripling twist of trapping the protagonist in a submarine, Vigil was one of the BBC’s biggest hits of 2021. So, where to now for the popular trapped-in-a-submarine drama? DCI Amy Silva is back for a new season, but she’s not trapped in a new submarine. Nor is she

<p>Tottenham’s talisman broke the game open against an exhausted Newcastle side from an orthodox left-wing position</p><p>Son Heung-min was the last player off the pitch at half-time at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, not because he was busy pumping the badge on his chest, working the crowd or berating the referee behind his hand, but because he was exhausted, forced to spend 30 seconds or so bent double in the Newcastle penalty area with his hands on his knees.</p><p>Two minutes before half-time Son had picked up the ball 15 yards inside his own half and just flicked on the burners, feet pounding the turf like a boxer hitting the speed ball.

Glacier is about wild swimming on Christmas Day – quite the fashion recently, but less so when Dawn, Jools and Lucy first congregate in 2007 on the banks of Foxleighmere lake. The trio meet when wronged wife Lucy hurls her wedding ring into the water. It bonks Dawn on the head, and a friendship gradually grows as the threesome reconvene yearly for their annual plunge.</p><p>At first, Lucy’s eagerness to recover her ring gives the narrative its scant momentum. Then the trio find a body in the water, and a story seems to take shape. But these (improbably, for a freshwater lake) are herrings, of the red variety: Spittle isn’t in the business of

Yet unfortunately that is what Sir Keir Starmer seems to believe.

<p>(Reprise)<br />The veteran rocker reworks favourite songs from his six-decade career in this intimate, imaginative solo set</p><p>Even at the age of 78, Neil Young is showing little inclination to slow down. Whether releasing newly recorded material (<em>World Record</em>), shelved albums from the 1970s (<em>Chrome Dreams</em>), old live sets (<em>Odeon Budokan</em>) or remastered versions of his back catalogue (<em>Ragged Glory</em>), he’s still pumping out records with Stakhanovite intensity. <em>Before and After</em> features reimagined solo versions of 13 songs from his back catalogue – from three Buffalo Springfield numbers to the closing Don’t Forget Love from 2021’s <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/dec/11/neil-young-and-crazy-horse-barn-review">Barn</a></em> – and one new song, the haunting If You Got Love, all sequenced into one seamless 48-minute suite.</p><p>A slowed-down, stripped-back On the Way Home loses some of the 1968 original’s joyous momentum,

<p>The NHS wants you to floss. Your dentist wants you to floss. But do the benefits really outweigh the tedium?</p><p></p><p>‘How often do you brush, Ralph?” a dentist asks Chief Wiggum’s son in Last Exit to Springfield, frequently cited as one of The Simpsons’ <a href="https://www.imdb.com/search/title/?series=tt0096697&amp;sort=user_rating,desc&amp;count=250">best ever episodes</a>. “Three times a day, sir!” chirps the hapless Ralph, only to have the cold glare of the dental lamp shone in his face along with his orthodontist’s ire: “Why must you turn my office into <em>a house of lies</em>?”</p><p>If this scene seems familiar, it’s probably because you have been interrogated once too often about how often you floss. Invented almost 200 years ago, flossing has never caught on in quite the same way as a twice-daily brush – and a few years ago, a decent-sized study put the dental profession on the defensive by claiming that it might not actually be all that worthwhile. But the NHS did

It’s our job as public servants to point out flaws in their plans</p><p>It was not always inevitable that a policy going badly wrong would lead to blame falling on the civil service. Unfortunately, it is increasingly becoming so. The more desperate the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/dec/09/rwanda-plan-50-chance-success-before-election-no-10-told">political situation</a>, the more likely it is that the government will find an individual or department to blame. All the better because they can’t answer back.</p><p>The Rwanda scheme fits neatly into this scenario. It is by any measure a controversial policy; even its cheerleaders would admit that. There are, of course, moral arguments about the policy – but there are also practical questions. Is it workable? Is it legal? Will it give value for money? The job of the civil service is to work through these quandaries with ministers.</p

Her most controversial work – so famous, it is by now pretty much proverbial – is <em>God Giving Birth</em> from 1968. The title spells it out; but just in case anyone is in doubt, the words are also lettered across the canvas beneath an image of a naked woman giving birth to a baby against a backdrop of outer darkness. It’s all said in stark black and white.</p><p>Reactions to this painting were (perhaps as much as the work itself) signs of the times. Sjöö was reported to the police for blasphemy, then for obscenity. The work was removed from

But then that was one of quite a few things that they didn’t foresee almost a decade ago.</p><p>For starters, the Duffer Brothers, as they are known and credited, did not expect <em>Stranger Things</em> to exist beyond one season.

## Architects Anne Lacaton and Jean-Philippe Vassal on the joy of reusing buildings rather than knocking them down

<p>The French architect duo, winners of the 2023 Soane medal, whose work has ranged from straw huts to social housing, talk about the freedom of working with what’s already there – and how to step back from perfection</p><p>The French architects Anne Lacaton and Jean-Philippe Vassal are famous for their belief in keeping existing buildings whenever possible, no matter how unpromising or unloved they may be. They follow, in effect, an architectural version of the Hippocratic oath – first, don’t demolish. It’s a message that has never been more pertinent, as it dawns on the construction industry that constant demolition and rebuilding is an environmentally devastating activity. The husband-and-wife team have been putting this idea into practice for decades, in projects such as the renovation of social housing blocks at Cité du Grand Parc in Bordeaux and the Tour Bois-le-Prêtre in Paris, and art centres such as the FRAC Nord-Pas de Calais in Dunkirk and the Palais de Tokyo in Paris.</p>

<p>There are many pitfalls to buying presents, from seeking an instant reaction to a fear of sentimentality. But a few simple psychological principles can help you make better choices</p><p>December can often feel like a never-ending ordeal, as we try to find the perfect gifts for our nearest and dearest. No matter how well we know someone, we struggle to discern their hidden wishes and desires. Each decision can feel like a test of our relationship. This is a natural consequence of the brain’s workings. Humans may be unique in our advanced ability to consider others’ viewpoints, but perspective-taking is enormously taxing for our little grey cells.</p><p>“It takes a lot of mental energy,” says Prof Julian Givi at West Virginia University. As a result, our choices of gifts are extremely prone to error. Researchers such as Givi have now identified a host of cognitive biases that lead our judgments astray, so that we waste our money and miss opportunities for greater social connection.

<p>I take my son’s Anglo-Saxon in hand, but his vocabulary gets the better of me once more</p><p>With a speed that may not surprise anyone, I have an update on last week’s column, which concerned my five-year-old son’s newfound propensity for swearing. To recap: he had taken to uttering the foul-mouthed, if charmingly incoherent, exclamation ‘forfookinsake’, when frustrated. We were worried by its regularity and vehemence, but especially by its cod-Hibernian pronunciation, which pointed to a clear provenance from his foul-mouthed, and Irish-accented parents. (Careful readers will note that this is a fancy way of saying we wouldn’t have minded so much if we thought we could blame anyone other than ourselves.)</p><p>In that column, I more-or-less made the argument that it’s best not to draw attention to such things, particularly if your child isn’t using it for shock value. Well, that was last week, when I was a merciful God King passing pearls of wisdom to the parents of the world, an

It’s all about those Christmas morning treats, if you can wait that long<p>First: <strong>Bare Bones</strong> Christmas Special 70%, £6.50/70g, came top in a recent Christmas Club tasting. It’s hard to believe there are just two ingredients: cocoa and sugar. (I wrote this before I saw this is almost exactly what’s written on the wrapper, but it’s so true one can’t argue with it.) The flavours just concertina on your tongue, a right proper lingual trip. There’s vine fruits in there, berries, spices, it’s all going on. Bare Bones is up there in chocolate making and if you know someone who loves dark chocolate it would be really remiss not to get them some. (Once you’re there do try the 68% Dominican Salt, £6.50/70g, which is one of my favourite ever bars of chocolate.)</p><p>Something very different is <strong>Venchi</strong>’s Choconougatine, £3/35g, which is a small bar of caramelised Piedmont hazelnut covered in dark chocolate.

At a dinner thrown to celebrate her triumph in Wagner’s <em>Lohengrin</em> at the Royal Opera House, Escoffier presented Nellie with fresh peaches – her absolute favourite – served over ice cream; later, he would amend the recipe by adding raspberry puree. Even today, the Savoy still serves it in one of its restaurants (or at least, a variation of it), the dish sitting between the mont d’or cheese and the petits fours on its £175-a-head tasting menu.</p><p>But as the food historian Pen Vogler writes in her satisfyingly replete new book, <em>Stuffed</em> – how it lives up to its title, bulging temptingly with information like some broad-in-the-

<p>The Magnum photographer, who died last month, shot celebrities and politicians, but canines appeared on more of his contact sheets than humans</p><p>The New York photographer Elliott Erwitt, who died on 29 November aged 95, was once asked how he got dogs to jump for his pictures. The trick, he suggested, was to speak their language. Bark at a dog, he said, and “sometimes they bark back, sometimes they jump”. Erwitt was a member of the Magnum agency for 70 years and worked on assignments around the world, taking pictures of politicians (famously of <a href="https://www.magnumphotos.com/newsroom/politics/elliott-erwitt-behind-the-image-the-kitchen-debate/">Richard Nixon poking Nikita Khrushchev in the chest</a> in 1959) and of celebrities (Marilyn Monroe, Humphrey Bogart, Jack Kerouac); even so, it was his comic affinity for canine subjects for which he was best loved.</p><p>The predeliction came as something of a surprise to him. “Most of the time,” he wrote in 1998, “when I am out

For a festive iteration, think: what would happen if Wednesday Addams met Studio 54 and a bit of restraint? So if you go for the goth eyes try a sheer finish. If black’s too much, try dark bronze. And if dark lipstick strikes fear, go nude. Morticia would be mortified, but at least you’ll look like you.</p><p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Vieve Eye Wand in Raven</strong> £23, <a href="https://www.vieve.co.uk/">vieve.co.uk</a> <br /><strong>2.</strong> <strong>RMS Beauty Legendary Serum Lipstick</strong> £33, <a href="https://www.spacenk.com/uk/home">spacenk.com</a> <br /><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Ruby Hammer Precision Liquid Eyeliner</st

<p>Fifty years after being accused of plagiarism, book is reissued in a bid to rehabilitate gifted Malian author Yambo Ouologuem</p><p>In 1968 the books pages of the French newspaper <em>Le Monde</em> excitedly praised an uncompromising new novel, <em>Bound to Violence</em>, going on to salute its author as one of “the rare intellectuals of international stature presented to the world by Black Africa”.</p><p>The newspaper’s words, written in tribute to the young Malian writer Yambo Ouologuem, sound condescending today.

Tawny, ruby or vintage, it is sure to hit the spot<p><strong>Tesco Finest 10-Year Old Tawny Port, Portugal NV (£14.50, <a href="https://www.tesco.com/groceries/en-GB/products/255247179">Tesco</a>) </strong>As I say every year in the same slightly sanctimonious tone used by parents fending off pet-seeking children, Port is not just for Christmas. Like its fortified Iberian cousins, madeira and sherry, it is outstanding value for the quality when compared to its unfortified peers, and it remains by far the most popular drink on offer when I do wine-tasting events, even at the height of summer. Still, for all its underrated seasonal versatility, I must admit strong, sweet port does come into its own at this time of year, when all of us are open to indulging in more sugar and alcohol (and post-prandial naps) than we (or our nearest and dearest) would normally deem acceptable. This is one area of wine where supermarket own-labels compare favourably to branded offerings, with Tesco’s array
