</p><p>While it admits that details remain a little hazy, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-map-verdansk-return-2024/">Insider Gaming</a> reckons "the current plan is to follow the traditional Warzone 'main map' release schedule and have Verdansk return as a part of Black Ops Gulf War Season 1".
</p><p>By examining how Activision typically schedules its releases, that suggests Verdansk will be making a comeback to the free-to-play battle royale shooter by the end of 2024.

</p><p>That's according to the MMO's producer/director Naoki Yoshida, who told <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/news/202312/08325585.html">Famitsu</a> that even though the team will attempt to optimise the game as much as possible "using the HDD would be a pain".
</p><p>"Details will be announced in due course. However, I would like you to prepare an SSD," Yoshida said when asked what kind of specs the PC version will demand (thanks, <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/final-fantasy-16/ssd">PCGN</a>).

The most vivid memory I have of childhood is sitting in the back of our dirty red Ford Orion on a violet-hued winter evening. Orange beads wash in from passing streetlights and throw chevrons of illumination across me and the boxes I hold close to my body. It's March 1999, we're returning from Norwich with my eighth birthday present, a large box I insist on holding, with a red vertical banner down its face, holding a Nintendo 64. Nestled between it and my chest, where it can't fall, is a smaller box - black and gold - inside of which is a copy of The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time.

The game was released the year before. First in Japan on the 21st November and then a couple of days later in the U.S., before finally appearing in the U.K. on the 11th Dec
