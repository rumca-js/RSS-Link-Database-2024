Super Pocket Capcom & Tiato Hands-On Review", "description": "The Super Mega Tech Super Pocket is a portable gaming device that comes preloaded with 12 classic arcade games from Capcom and Taito. It also supports Evercade cartridges, which gives you access to hundreds more games.\nIn this video, I'll be taking a look at the Super Pocket and giving you my thoughts on its features, performance, and overall value.\nThe Super Pocket performs well and is able to run all of the preloaded games smoothly. The Evercade cartridges also work flawlessly. The buttons are responsive and the screen is clear and bright. We also do a teardown to see what CPU the Super Pocket is using.\n\nFollow Me On Twitter: https://twitter.com/theetaprime\nFollow Me On Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/etaprime/\n\nVip-Urcdkey Black Friday Sale Code for software: ETA\nWindows 10 Pro OEM Key($15): https://biitt.ly/KpEmf\nWindows 11 Pro Key($21): https://biitt.ly/RUZiX\nWindows10 Home Key($14): https://biitt.ly/2tPi1\nOffice 2019 pro key($46): https://biitt.ly/o0OQT\nOffice 2021 pro key", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsm4GlKE3tc", "date_published": "2023-12-10T15:06:00+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "ETA PRIME", "album": "ETA PRIME", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/Jsm4GlKE3tc/hqdefault.jpg", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}]
