Over the past few days, the media and social media in mainland China have been buzzing about two "old friends of the Chinese people.‚Äù One is the 99-year-old Charles Munger, a financial tycoon and partner of Warren Buffett, and the other is Henry Kissinger, a former U.S. secretary of state who was known as an evergreen in the diplomatic world, who passed away at 100 years of age. 
The Beijing government expressed grief as if it had lost a family member. This is understandable, especially for Kissinger. With his departure, the CCP will no longer be able to find someone just like him. After all, not everyone can hold the title of former US Secretary of State. There should be quite a few American secretaries of state still alive, but except for Kissinger, who was out of office for decades, no one else is willing to stand up for the CCP.
