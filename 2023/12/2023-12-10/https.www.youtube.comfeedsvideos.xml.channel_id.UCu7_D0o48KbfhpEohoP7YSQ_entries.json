This is particularly important for batteries in expensive devices like smartphones or tablets because repairing a defective battery is expensive.\nIt took Apple many years till, finally, the iPhone 15 can automatically stop charging at 80% and so extend the lifetime of your battery considerably.

As a bonus, I will show you why we have this tablet and what it displays. And I will reveal the secret behind this number.\n\nMy second channel: https://www.youtube.com/HB9BLAWireless\n\nLinks:\nUSB switch: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DBBU65n or https://amzn.to/46QEXoQ\nSonoff Basic: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DDcvvSd or https://amzn.to/3RdctQI\nSonoff S26: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DkgKlSN\n90 degrees USB-C cable: ht", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Czw5NnNCW10", "date_published": "2023-12-10T08:00:05+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "Andreas Spiess", "album": "Andreas Spiess", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/Czw5NnNCW10/hqdefault.jpg", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}]
