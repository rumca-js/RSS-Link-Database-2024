<p>Instead of simmering in a stew of rage and resentment, I became a purveyor of transgressive acts, using street art to disrupt and spread joy </p><p>The notion of becoming invisible as an ageing woman has become an accepted trope. My friends and I, from our late 50s onwards, were first gobsmacked then increasingly enraged at being talked over, not served, not replied to, brushed aside and not taken seriously. Small accretions of casual insult that eroded our hard-earned sense of self and agency.</p><p>Instead of simmering in a stew of rage and resentment I began to wonder if that conferred invisibility could be harnessed.

The original <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/jul/02/philipfrench">Chicken Run</a></em> remains a classic of family entertainment, unbeatable in its inventiveness, distinctive aesthetic and deliciously absurd humour. Disappointingly but perhaps not surprisingly, this sequel fails to match the original on any level whatsoever.

Sweet-natured, sweet-toothed dreamers arrive in a strange land where they are forced to overcome adversity by employing, among other things, their passion and skill for creating sugar-based foodstuffs. King’s trademark box-of-delights storytelling approach combines showy, gymnastically agile editing and a disarmingly handmade, artisanal quality to the production design. At times, his films can venture a little too far towards a quirky, Etsy shop aesthetic, but for the most part, the alchemic King’s approach continues to create gold. <em>Wonka</em> is an effervescent pleasure – an endlessly, intricate
