This vlog is all about an amazing visit to a Cuban cigar factory. Our journey begins as we say goodbye to the fancy MGM Gran Muthu Habana. Hop on a comfy bus for a trip to our destination - Cayo Guillermo. I'll share the distance and travel time between Havana and Cayo Guillermo as we ride in style.

We can't travel without a sip of paradise! Find out where to enjoy a delicious PiÃ±a colada as we cruise to our destination. See the similarities between the charming buildings of Cuba and those in Bengal. It's like a little piece of Bengal in Cuba. Join me as we dive into local life at a Cuban Pizza shop. Chat with friendly locals and learn how much a pizza costs in Cuba. The best part was our visit to a real Cuban cigar factory. See the hard work that goes into making the world's best cigars!
