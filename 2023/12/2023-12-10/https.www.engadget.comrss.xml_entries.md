<p>Believe it or not, scientists have been using virtual reality setups to study brain activity in lab mice for years. In the past, this has been done by surrounding the mice with flat displays — a tactic that has obvious limitations for simulating a realistic environment. Now, in an attempt to create a more immersive experience, a team at <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2023/12/immersive-vr-goggles-for-mice-unlock-new-potential-for-brain-science/">Northwestern University</a> actually developed tiny VR goggles that fit over a mouse’s face… and most of its body. This has allowed them to simulate overhead threats for the first time, and map the mice’s brain activity all the while.</p>
<p>The system, dubbed Miniature Rodent Stereo Illumination VR (or iMRSIV), isn’t strapped onto the mouse’s head like a VR headset for humans. Instead, the goggles are positioned at the front of a treadmill, surrounding the mouse’s entire field of view as it runs in

<p>Apple is planning some big hardware drops for early 2024, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>’s Mark Gurman. In the <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-12-10/apple-aapl-to-fix-confusing-ipad-lineup-with-new-ipad-pro-mid-tier-ipad-air-lpzjekw4?sref=10lNAhZ9"><em><ins>Power On</ins></em></a> newsletter, Gurman predicts the company will release the next generation of iPad Pro and iPad Air in March — each of which is expected to come in two sizes — and the new M3 MacBook Airs. The Mac Studio and Mac Pro will likely be much later to the M3 party; Gurman writes that Apple won’t have these ready for release until at least the end of 2024, and they could even slip into 2025.</p>
<p>With the release of its new iPads, Apple is planning to make clearer distinctions between the models so the choices are less confusing for consumers, according to Gurman. The iPad Pro is expected to get Apple’s new M3 chip, an OLED display and come in two sizes: 11 and

<p>Alex Jones is back on X five years after then-Twitter made the decision to permanently ban him and his show, Infowars, for violating the site’s policy on “abusive behavior.” Elon Musk — who last year <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1593681389937102851">said he wouldn’t</a> unban Jones because of the conspiracy theorist’s insistence on calling the Sandy Hook massacre a hoax — created a <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1733529033575465381">poll</a> on X over the weekend asking users to vote on whether Jones should be reinstated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The poll closed with a majority vote for “Yes.” As of Sunday, Jones’ personal account was once again active, and already retweeting Andrew Tate.</p>

<p>Company Towns — wherein a single firm provides most or all necessary services, from housing and employment to commerce and amenities to a given community — have dotted America since before the Civil War. As we near the end of the first quarter of the 21st century, they're making a comeback with <a href="https://ktla.com/news/california/mystery-land-buyers-around-california-air-force-base-revealed/">a new generation of ultra-wealthy elites gobbling up land and looking to build towns in their own image</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And why should only terrestrial workers be exploited? Elon Musk has long talked of his plans to colonize Mars through his company SpaceX and those plans don't happen without a sizeable — and in this case, notably captive — workforce on hand. The same Elon Musk who spent $44 billion to run a ubiquitous social media site into the ground, whose brain computer interface company can't stop killing monkeys and whose automotive company can't stop killing pedestrians, wants

<p>It was never going to last. Ever since it was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/beeper-says-it-reverse-engineered-imessage-into-an-android-app-172250419.html">launched this week</a>, the Beeper Mini app, which let Android users get iMessage text support, was expected to be in trouble as soon as it caught Apple's attention. And catch Apple's attention it has. Yesterday, the entire Beeper platform <a href="https://www.engadget.com/beeper-minis-imessage-integration-is-on-the-fritz-211712651.html">appeared to be on the fritz</a>, resulting in speculation that the iPhone maker had been shutting down the iMessage workarounds. As of this morning, Beeper Mini was <a href="https://twitter.com/onbeeper/status/1733537832520855925">still posting on X (formerly Twitter)</a> that it was working on and potentially fixing the outage, but with an announcement from Apple today, all that may be for naught.&nbsp;</p>
