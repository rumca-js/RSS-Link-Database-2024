Griffith's early real time thriller, still thrilling and intense for today's time. 
The Lonely Villa is about a gang of thieves who lure a man out of his home so that they can rob it and threaten his wife and children. The family barricade themselves in an interior room, but the criminals are well-equipped for breaking in. When the father finds out what is happening, he must race against time to get back home.  DW Griffith does exactly what was needed for the time as he successfully invents cross cutting edits of the scenes while some of them were fastly moving. Apart from that, he keeps the audience guessing on what should happen in the end.
The thrillers made after 30s and 40s in one room or at one place were highly influenced by The Lonely Villa.
