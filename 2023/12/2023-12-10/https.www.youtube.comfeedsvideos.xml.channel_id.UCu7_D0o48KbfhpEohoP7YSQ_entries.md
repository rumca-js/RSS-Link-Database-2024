Rechargeable batteries last way longer if we do not charge them up to 100% or fully discharge them. This is particularly important for batteries in expensive devices like smartphones or tablets because repairing a defective battery is expensive.
It took Apple many years till, finally, the iPhone 15 can automatically stop charging at 80% and so extend the lifetime of your battery considerably. Maybe Android phones were faster.
This is the best solution, but today, we will solve the problem for all other devices, including our Dashboard Tablet in the kitchen. As a bonus, I will show you why we have this tablet and what it displays. And I will reveal the secret behind this number.
