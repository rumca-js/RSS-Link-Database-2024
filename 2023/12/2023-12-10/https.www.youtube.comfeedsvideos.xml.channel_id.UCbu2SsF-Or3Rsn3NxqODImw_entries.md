From Call of Duty to Counter-Strike, the sub-machine gun has dominated virtual battlefields, so much so that nearly every shooter has at least one that players would label “overpowered”. Today, some consider the weapon to be niche or obsolete, but why has the SMG reigned supreme in gaming for so long?

With the help of Keeper of Firearms & Artillery, Jonathan Ferguson, we’ve come to the Royal Armouries museum in the UK to learn more about  the history of the SMG, and find out why games are getting the humble SMG wrong.

In this episode of Loadout, Dave Jewitt visits the Royal Armouries to talk to Keeper of Firearms & Artillery Jonathan Ferguson to chart the many differences between real SMGs and their virtual counterparts.
