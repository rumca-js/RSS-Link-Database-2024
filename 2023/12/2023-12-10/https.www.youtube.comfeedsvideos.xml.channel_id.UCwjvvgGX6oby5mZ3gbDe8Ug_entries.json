This is understandable, especially for Kissinger. With his departure, the CCP will no longer be able to find someone just like him. After all, not everyone can hold the title of former US Secretary of State. There should be quite a few American secretaries of state still alive, but except for Kissinger, who was out of office for decades, no one else is willing to stand up for the CCP. \n\nHave questions? Do you have something to share with us about China? We want to hear from you! \nEmail: Cinsights.subscription@g", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9l5t4mHJPU", "date_published": "2023-12-10T20:15:06+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "China Insights", "album": "China Insights", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/K9l5t4mHJPU/hqdefault.jpg", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 52, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 1, "page_rating": 52, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}]
