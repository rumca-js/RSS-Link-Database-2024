Blood West is a first-person stealth game that taps into the weird west sub-genre of horror. The game puts players into the shoes of an undead gunslinger tasked with ridding the land of evil. Along the way, the player will get their hands on a variety of weapons and magical tools to help them take on the grotesque enemies all over the world.

The gameplay loop in Blood West is quite simple; it encourages exploration since you need money to find supplies, and as you manage to explore further into the game’s grim worlds, you’ll end up getting your hands on powerful items and weapons. There is also an emphasis on stealth, especially in the early game, since you don’t quite have access to all of your defensive perks yet. Enemies can hit like a truck, so the title’s Thief-inspired stealth mechanics come in quite handy on that front.
