The game puts players into the shoes of an undead gunslinger tasked with ridding the land of evil. Along the way, the player will get their hands on a variety of weapons and magical tools to help them take on the grotesque enemies all over the world.\n\nThe gameplay loop in Blood West is quite simple; it encourages exploration since you need money to find supplies, and as you manage to explore further into the game\u2019s grim worlds, you\u2019ll end up getting your hands on powerful items and weapons. There is also an emphasis on stealth, especially in the early game, since you don\u2019t quite have access to all of your defensive perks yet. Enemies can hit like a truck, so the title\u2019s Thief-inspired stealth mechanics come in quite handy on that front.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4Di0_9-v4", "date_published": "2023-12-10T18:30:41+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "GamingBolt", "album": "GamingBolt", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/vy4Di0_9-v4/hqdefault.jpg", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "15 Best Single Player Games of 2023 YOU LIKELY MISSED", "description": "The stars had to align in more ways than one for 2023 to be as packed full of stellar new game releases as it was, and the end result was a year that\u2019s likely going to be remembered as one of the best this medium has ever enjoyed. \n\nBut a byproduct of that much activity is always going to be that some games that deserve your attention might end up getting lost in the shuffle, and sure enough, we\u2019ve seen that happening this year as well. \n\nThroughout the year, we\u2019ve seen several single player titles that have merited far more widespread success than they\u2019ve actually ended up seeing, and here, we\u2019re going to talk exactly about that, as we list some of 2023\u2019s best single player games that you may have missed out on.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gn4qXelHKzA", "date_published": "2023-12-10T15:00:36+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "GamingBolt", "album": "GamingBolt", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/gn4qXelHKzA/hqdefault.jpg", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "CAN'T WAIT FOR GTA 6?
