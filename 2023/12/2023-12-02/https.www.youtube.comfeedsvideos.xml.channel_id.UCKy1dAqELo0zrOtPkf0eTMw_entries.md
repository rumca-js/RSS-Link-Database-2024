One of the biggest questions about GTA 6 is about its location. Where will GTA 6 be set? Well all signs are pointing toward Florida, and one fan has put together a map of what they think the location will be based off of the leaks from 2022. Fans online constructed the possible map for GTA 6 based on leaked clips, where they gathered the coordinates and pieced together what looks to be a pretty convincing recreation of something yet to be confirmed. The GTA 6 first trailer will be arriving on December 5th at 9am ET so we'll know a lot more about it after the #GTA6 Rockstar games trailer drops. For now, we'll be looking at what we know about where GTA 6 is located, and speculate on all the leaked locations we'd love to see once the trailer drops. Is this #RockstarGames making a return to #ViceCity? We’ll find out soon.

## The Suicide Squad Isekai Trailer Reveals Anime Harley Quinn and Joker - IGN The Fix: Entertainment

We got the trailer for The Suicide Squad Isekai anime series set to release sometime next year. For those unfamiliar with this particular anime genre, ISEKAI essentially means ‘another world’, wherein protagonists from a modern day setting are transported to a fantasy world full of magic and mystical beings. For this one, it’ll see Harley Quinn, Deadshot, Peacemaker, Clayface, and King Shark transported to a world, presumably by Amanda Waller, tasked with taking out random creatures to level up their XP. I have no clue if that’s correct, but you never know - WB. Japan hasn’t released much information on the upcoming anime.
