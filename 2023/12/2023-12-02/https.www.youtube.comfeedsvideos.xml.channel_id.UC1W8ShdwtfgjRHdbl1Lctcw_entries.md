I colorized, restored and created the sound design for this video of a trolley ride through the streets of 1900s New York. Immerse yourself in the vintage charm of the iconic trolleys as they weave their way through the historic cityscape, offering a nostalgic glimpse into the past, where the clatter of the rails and the timeless architecture transport you to the heart of New York City 123 years ago.

Video Restoration Process:
âœ” FPS boosted to 60 frames per second 
âœ” Image resolution boosted up to HD 
âœ” Improved video sharpness and brightness 
âœ” Colorized only for the ambiance (not historically accurate)
âœ”added sound design only for the ambiance
âœ”restoration:(stabilisation,denoise,cleand,deblur,deflicker) 

Please, be aware that colorization colors are not real and fake, colorization was made only for the ambiance and do not represent real historical data.
