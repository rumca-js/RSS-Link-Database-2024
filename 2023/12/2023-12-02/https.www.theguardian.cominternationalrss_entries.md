<p>Harry Winks scored a last-gasp winner as Leicester beat West Brom 2-1 in a dramatic finish to give their manager, Enzo Maresca, a winning first return to the Hawthorns. Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall’s 72nd-minute header – his sixth goal of the season – put the Championship leaders ahead and the midfielder then set up Winks in the fourth minute of stoppage time after the Albion substitute Josh Maja appeared to have rescued a point.</p><p>Maresca, who started his professional career at West Brom and played 47 games there between 1998 and 2000, will have been relieved as there was little between the teams, who both hit the goal frame in the first half. West Brom had a penalty claim turned down when Grady Diangana went down after it appeared he was pushed over in the box.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/dec/02/west-brom-leicester-championship-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From a bedbug squashed by Napoleon to a priest who comes back as a wild boar, this riotous French tale of resurrection is a tribute to ‘translators everywhere, at all times’</p><p>French author Mathias Énard, winner of the Prix Goncourt and nominated for the International Booker prize, begins his new novel by quoting the Buddha: “In our former lives, we have all been earth, stone, dew, wind, fire, moss, tree, insect, fish, turtle, bird and mammal.” The central conceit of The Annual Banquet of the Gravediggers’ Guild is the great “wheel of suffering” through which the souls of all living things are reincarnated in a new form immediately after death. Murderers, for example, come back as red worms slithering “cheek by jowl” under a dank shower tray in a rundown rural annexe rented by an anthropologist who is writing a thesis on “what it means to live in the country nowadays”.</p><p>The novel is also a long love letter to the Deux-Sèvres, where Énard spent his childhood: a predominant
