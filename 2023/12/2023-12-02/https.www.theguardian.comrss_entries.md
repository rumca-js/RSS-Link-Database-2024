The NHS’s deal with the US tech company raises privacy concerns but a unified database could be a medical gamechanger<p>As we sink deeper into the digital age, a problem emerges. People dislike the idea of giving up their data to some vast and powerful entity. But, increasingly, you can’t run things without them.</p><p>The dilemma sharpens when it comes to health systems. These involve the most sensitive kind of personal information – the sort you’d really rather not end up in the hands of insurers, say, or a future employer. Yet without a powerful data system to crunch through everyone’s medical histories, things fall apart. The right file from your GP doesn’t quite get to the paramedics in time and they give you the wrong treatment. You move from one city to another and somehow half your vaccine record goes missing.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/dec/02/you-may-balk-at-giving-health-data-to-palantir-but-it-could-save-your-life">Continue reading...</a>

<p>There is something stirring in the red half of north London. A clinical victory – Arsenal’s fourth in a row in all competitions – thanks to two early goals from Bukayo Saka and Martin Ødegaard sent Mikel Arteta’s side four points clear at the top of the table and strengthened their quest to seal a first league title for two decades.</p><p>After a slow start that still left them within touching distance of the other contenders, Arsenal are now clicking into gear at the perfect time and it is no coincidence that their return to goalscoring form has coincided with Ødegaard’s return from injury. The Arsenal captain was in sparkling form against a Wolves side who never stopped running for manager, Gary O’Neil, but ultimately could not respond to their opponents’ show of quality inside the opening quarter of an hour despite a late consolation for Matheus Cunha that sparked a frantic finale.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/dec/02/arsenal-wolves-premier-league-match

<p>As a boy,<a href="https://www.instagram.com/lovehulten/?hl=en"> Love Hultén</a> used to tear electronics apart trying to understand their insides. Now, the Swedish audiovisual artist creates bespoke retro-futuristic synthesisers; his clients include Eminem, A$AP Rocky, Danger Mouse and Michael B Jordan. “I love analogue synths: learning how to manipulate sounds using hands-on controls and tactile waypoints is very intuitive and fun,” says Hultén. Unlike the touchscreens the music industry now tends to favour, his handmade synths are encased in wood, resulting in visually striking, high-concept objects. “I try to present alternatives to today’s tech. Commercial products go through strict processes that in my opinion kill the product. I’m a small-scale, one-man studio, unaffected by corporate principles, and I don’t need to compromise.” </p><p><em>See more at <a href="http://lovehulten.com/">lovehulten.com</a></em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2023/d

<p>Special cheer for all the family: a negroni made with infused gin, nutmeg and cinnamon fizz, lemon gingerade, mulled cider, cranberry mojito, and – of course – a festive punch</p><p>For a couple of festive weeks at least, it feels acceptable – appropriate, even – to have a special drink at any time of day. Whether that’s just for you, or for family or for when you have people coming round, take a little effort over the quality and combination of the ingredients, and pleasure is guaranteed. These six Christmas drinks each carry flavours that cement that feeling, and even the ones with alcohol can be tweaked to cater to those too young or who prefer to be booze-free: for the spiced gin and the mojito, for instance, try one of the excellent alcohol-free spirits now out there, and there are several zero-alcohol proseccos and ciders available these days. Some of the recipes require just a little time for a key ingredient to be made ahead, but the result is so worth it; the making of th

<p>Euro 2024 tournament director on his ambitions for next summer, football’s money problem and why Germany’s men’s team fell away</p><p>Philipp Lahm gazes over the pitch he called home for a decade and a half, and allows the memories to flood back. It was June 2006 and the first day of the long, roasting, transformative summer that brought the world to a modern and outwards-facing Germany. He had feared missing the opening game of the World Cup, at Allianz Arena of all places, after elbow surgery and there was a feeling of quiet exultation at being passed fit to play. So the elation was unconfined when, six minutes after kick-off, he cut inside two Costa Rica defenders and scored a sensational goal that set the competition on its way.</p><p>“The referee had to test my splint in the dressing room right before the match,” he remembers. “When he said, ‘Yes, no problem, you can play’, that was the greatest thing. I was born about five kilometres away from here, my whole family was in th

<p>Former radio presenter Dan Jennings regretted never interviewing the singer-songwriter, so he started a podcast to try to track him down. He almost lost hope until a chance encounter …</p><p>Dan Jennings’s greatest regret after 25 years in local radio had been missing out on an interview with his idol, Paul Weller. It did not seem likely that the 47-year-old former broadcaster would get much closer to realising the goal in his new career in project management.</p><p>With time on his hands during lockdown, Jennings launched a podcast for other Weller super fans, entitled Desperately Seeking Paul, but it unexpectedly became something of a hit and after three years, coming up to 180 episodes and a highly fruitful chance encounter with Weller himself in a bar below the Guardian’s offices in King’s Cross in north London, he finally got his Modfather.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/dec/02/podcasting-paul-weller-fan-dan-jennings-desperately-seeking-paul">Continue rea

<p>The Israeli government is stripping away our freedoms – economic, physical, even the ability to celebrate. Yet the world looks away</p><p>In the eyes of the world, there seem to be two kinds of violence against the Palestinian people. There are the genocidal horrors that have been unfolding in Gaza, in which Israel is erasing families, neighbourhoods and livelihoods. Then there is the other kind: the violence that Palestinians have been subjected to since the 1948 Nakba, overlooked and barely commented upon.</p><p>Violence in the West Bank always seems to be placed into the second category, no matter how extreme. Yet in recent weeks, we have seen a marked escalation from Israel. Politicians seem to have decided they have free rein while this latest war plays out and all eyes are on Gaza. But look at the West Bank and you will see the actions of an increasingly totalitarian regime that is detaining Palestinians without charge, torturing prisoners and limiting physical and economic

<p><strong>Tebay, Cumbria:</strong> A surprise surplus of Halloween veg on the farm means we’ve got new arrivals</p><p>During the autumn half-term week, my son and his girlfriend held a “Pumpkin Patch” day on the farm. As well as pumpkins for sale, we had goats, sheep, hens, cows and ponies for children to see. We set up a walk around the farm for children to do, spotting wildlife along the way, with tree-planting at the end of the walk. Each tree had a name tag tied on to it, and the children will be able to come back next year and see how their tree has grown.</p><p>The wildlife on the farm was very obliging for the open day. Everybody seemed to see the two red deer that are living in a fen near the River Lune, and the herons put on a display, soaring high and fishing on the riverbank. The fell ponies who can be haughty and aloof seemed intrigued to see so many people walking through the farm and came down to the fence, tossing their manes and inviting people to stroke them.</p> <a
