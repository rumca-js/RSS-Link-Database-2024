The first official glimpse at Fortnite Chapter 5 is now available to watch online, and shows a host of new upgrades available on an all-new battle royale island. 
</p><p>
The ability to ride trains, wield riot shields, mod weapons, scramble across buildings and grapple up structures is shown in the official launch trailer below. 
</p><p>
Fortnite's Chapter 5 Island clearly features a number of biomes, including one with sunny vinyards, alpine mountains, and ancient ruins.

## Fortnite's The Big Bang event was a blast of marketing for the game's multi-genre future

Tonight's Fortnite live event - the first in almost a year - was an eye-popping rollercoaster ride for those lucky enough to see it. After a throwback season based on the game's original  map, it was perhaps fitting that The Big Bang also saw the return of Fortnite's old capacity issues - as more than 10 million players reportedly swamped the game's servers, while many millions more were left to watch the event online. 
</p><p>
In-game, as the event's countdown timer hit zero above Dusty Divot, players were initially treated to an abbreviated version of the game's original The End event, with its apocalyptic meteor causing the Island to get sucked into a black hole once again (although, Epic has already confirmed, the OG map will emerge just okay due to public demand in 2024).

</p><p>It's almost impossible to go online these days without being smacked in the face by at least half a dozen purported GTA 6 "leaks", but this one was more plausible than most, which is probably why it gained traction. Quickly. 
</p><p>Two videos have been posted by the seemingly throwaway account <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@i_see_in_4k/video/7308063490751679750">i_see_in_4k</a>, and both have - in the last couple of hours &ndash; shared a few tantalising seconds of what the poster insists is GTA 6.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-tiktok-leak-has-come-from-the-s

</p><p>Its predecessor, WWE 2K23, was officially announced in January 2023, and released swiftly thereafter in March of that same year, leading some pundits to suggest that a similar timescale could apply here, too.
</p><p>Whilst it's unlikely to come as a shock that the sequel was on the way, the rating board has seemingly confirmed the game's existence ahead of 2K's own marketing schedule.

</p><p>The tool, known as IRIS, automatically analyses and identifies frames within videos that could potentially impact players who experience photosensitivity.

Nestled deep in the heart of virtual Yokohama down an ordinary alleyway lies the Sasaki Game Center - a virtual playground celebrating Sega's arcade heritage. The arcade has become a staple of Sega's Like A Dragon series but with the latest series entry, we've reached a new milestone - Sega has finally, for the first time, introduced official Model 3 emulation with it comes one of the finest racing games ever made.

Daytona USA 2: Battle on the Edge - now known, thanks to licensing issues, as Sega Racing Classic 2 - is an arcade racing game from the legendary AM2 and it stands as one of the fastest, most elegantly designed racing games of all time. It's not alone either, as a second Model 3 game is also included - Fighting Vipers 2. Daytona USA 2 has never been available on home consoles before, but Fighting Vipers 2 has in the f

It's taken five and a half years of asking from the community, but Sea of Thieves' oft-requested private servers are almost here, with Rare now confirming the feature will arrive as part of the multiplayer pirate adventure's third major Season 10 update on Thursday, 7th December.
</p><p>
Private servers will be available under the new banner of Safer Seas mode, which'll co-exist alongside the current shared world experience - officially renamed High Seas. Safer Seas enables up to four friends to crew a ship across a private version of the world and access all PvE content - ranging from emergent events to Trading Company quests and narrative-driven Tall Tales - without needing to deal with other crews.

It is, then, pretty much exactly what people have been asking for since Sea of Thieves' launch back in 2018
