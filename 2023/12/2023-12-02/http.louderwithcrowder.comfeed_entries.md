A cornfed unit of a man, one with <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/hockey-mullet-dallas-stars" target="_blank">the second most glorious mullet we've seen go viral</a> this year, was being chased through a Nashville mall by police. Until the cop put him down with a taser.</p><p>Unfortunately, in the heat of pursuit, the officer did not consider the girthiness of the target when the taser was deployed. It was only enough voltage to drop him momentarily. The dude was able to get back up.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

One is to apologize, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ne-yo-apologizes-update" target="_blank">or at the very least, have your PR team write an apology on your behalf</a>. The other is to lay low until the controversy or nontroversy dies down. Comedian Matt Rife went with option C: Naplam. Not only refuse to apologize but refuse in a way guaranteed to trigger haters more better than before. He did a podcast with Jordan Peterson.</p><p>To recap, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/matt-rife-netflix-special" target="_blank">the usual suspects tried to cancel Matt Rife</a> over the following joke from his new Netflix special that a) they say makes fun of domestic violence, and, more importantly, b) kills.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter

	Even a broken clock is right twice a day.
</p><p>
	Has Fetterman finally conquered his disabilities? Not too long ago, the presence of John Fetterman’s hoodie and shorts in the Senate drew attention to his mental deficiencies that seemed to have made him incapable of putting on pants.
</p><p>
	Not being able to process basic conversations was not much of a concern for the left. It actually wasn't until he started supporting Israel that they began to care.
</p><p>
	Fetterman has found himself at odds with his far-left colleagues multiple times in the past several months, including for his pro-Israel stance.
