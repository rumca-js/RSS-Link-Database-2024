<p>Amazon <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/innovation-at-amazon/amazon-project-kuiper-spacex-launch"><ins>announced</ins></a> on Friday that it’s signed a contract with SpaceX to deliver batches of its Project Kuiper satellites to low Earth orbit in 2025. <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/starlinks-satellite-cell-service-is-set-to-launch-in-2024-but-only-for-sms-215036124.html"><ins>SpaceX is undoubtedly Amazon’s biggest competitor</ins></a> as it breaks into the satellite internet space, and already has a constellation of over 4,000 Starlink satellites in operation. It’s also a rival of Blue Origin, the aerospace company founded by Jeff Bezos that has its own rockets in development. But when it comes to launches, SpaceX’s pace and the reliability of its Falcon 9 rocket is unmatched.</p>
<p>The contract with SpaceX is for three Falcon 9 launches, Amazon said in a blog post. They’re expected to lift off in mid-2025. Amazon i

<p>Amazon has released the first official teaser trailer for <em>Fallout, </em>its upcoming live-action series based on the best-selling video games. The clip gives us a look at Amazon’s take on the post-apocalyptic wasteland, and <em>Yellowjackets</em> actor Ella Purnell emerging from Vault 33 to meet it for the first time. The series will be set in Los Angeles 200 years after a nuclear war brought Earth to ruins.</p>
<div id="4bfc3f64c1fb49a5a6c3855ac52cfcb3"></div>
<p>The trailer arrives a few days after <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/amazons-new-fallout-series-will-reveal-the-origins-of-vault-boy-221607044.html">Amazon released stills from the show</a>, now showing a deeper look at the characters and the horrors they’ll encounter in the wastes. And it so far seems a promising indication of how the series will approach its well-loved source material.&nbsp;</p>

<p>OpenAI is pushing the launch of its GPT Store to early 2024, according to an email seen by <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/1/23984497/openai-gpt-store-delayed-ai-gpt"><em>The Verge</em></a>. The company <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gpts-are-the-single-application-mini-chatgpt-models-that-anyone-can-create-203311858.html">introduced its GPT Builder tool</a> in early November at its first developer conference, giving subscribers an easy way to create their own custom AI bots. At the time, OpenAI also said it would soon release the GPT Store for users to list their GPTs and potentially make money from them. It was initially slated for a November launch. But, with the surprise ouster of <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-joins-openai-board-as-sam-altman-returns-as-ceo-023844090.html">OpenAI’s since-reinstated CEO Sam Altman</a>, the month didn’t quite pan out as planned.</p>

<p>Sorry to interrupt your Saturday, but did you somehow miss that Google made a geothermal energy plant <a href="https://www.engadget.com/googles-first-geothermal-energy-project-is-up-and-running-162630603.html">in the middle of Nevada</a>? You know, that place with all the water for turbines? Or the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/a-silly-attack-made-chatgpt-reveal-real-phone-numbers-and-email-addresses-200546649.html">incredibly dumb way</a> security researchers were able to pull private information from ChatGPT? This week's YouTube-coated version of TMA covers that and getting far too enthusiastic (or entirely non-plussed) about all these other things from this week in tech.</p>
