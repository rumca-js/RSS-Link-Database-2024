	Imagine you have a function parameter that you want to protect from direct access, ensuring that all future interactions occur through a wrapper or transformation. This situation often arises in scenarios like implementing a logging wrapper for a class. In this discussion, we'll explore a clever technique known as "hide_name" to achieve this goal, allowing you to enforce the use of the wrapper and prevent direct access to the parameter.</p>

		Suppose you have a function that takes a parameter that you want to transform in some way, and you want to require that all future access to the parameter be done through the transformed version. One example is a wrapper class that does logging.&sup1;</p>
