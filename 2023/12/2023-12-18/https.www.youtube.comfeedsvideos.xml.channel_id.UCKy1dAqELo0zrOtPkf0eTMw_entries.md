Actor Johnathan Majors has been found guilty of 3rd degree assault and harassment. The charges carry with them a sentence of up to one year in jail. He was, however, found not guilty of both intentional assault in the third degree and aggravated harassment in the second degree. The charges Jonathan Majors faced weren’t brought on by the alleged victim in the incident, but by the state of New York, making this a criminal trial rather than civil. Majors will be sentenced on February 6th of next year. What you can expect from Netflix’s One Piece anime remake. Plus some Rick and Morty anime news you might be excited to hear. All this and more on today’s fix!

## Cookie Cutter Review

Cookie Cutter reviewed by Vikki Blake on PC, also available on PlayStation and Xbox.

Despite an occasionally frustrating early game, Cookie Cutter is a thoughtful, creative, and mostly approachable metroidvania that embodies all the things you'd expect from the genre with its own distinctive style. If this type of game isn't usually your thing, then its fairly standard structure probably won't do much to win you over, especially when its map can sometimes feel a little less open than it first appears. But as a fast, frantic action game to keep you busy, you could do a lot worse than spending a little quality time with  Cherry and her gruesome friends.

The Finals reviewed by Justin Koreis on PC, also available on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S.

The Finals does a great job standing out from the competitive shooter crowd thanks to its fast-paced action, excellent environmental destruction, and gameshow-meets-squad shooter vibes. The way flying through the battlefield with a grappling hook or hulk-smashing through buildings mixes with its strict, objective-based modes is a breath of fresh air. It’s a concern that there are only two of those modes total right now, and it definitely feels like both in-game balance and the overall reward economy need some adjustments. But those are small critiques relative to the outrageous fun and breathtaking spectacle of buildings crumbling around you.

Night Swim is a new supernatural thriller from Atomic Monster and Blumhouse, the producers of M3GAN. Based on the acclaimed 2014 short film by Rod Blackhurst and Bryce McGuire, the film stars Wyatt Russell (The Falcon and the Winter Soldier) as Ray Waller, a former major league baseball player forced into early retirement by a degenerative illness, who moves into a new home with his concerned wife Eve (Oscar® nominee Kerry Condon, The Banshees of Inisherin), teenage daughter Izzy (Amélie Hoeferle, this fall’s The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes) and young son Elliot (Gavin Warren, Fear the Walking Dead). 
 
Secretly hoping, against the odds, to return to pro ball, Ray persuades Eve that the new home’s shimmering backyard swimming pool will be fun for the kids and provide physical therapy for him. But a dark secret in the home’s past will unleash a malevolent force that will drag the family under, into the depths of inescapable terror.

Here are all the winners of the 2023 IGN Awards, voted on by the entire IGN staff (so If you disagree with the winners, please don’t take it out on the guy hosting this video.) It was a landmark year for games, between The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, Baldur’s Gate 3, Alan Wake 2, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, Street Fighter 6 and Lies of P, to name a few, but it was a big year across the entire multimedia pop-culture entertainment landscape. On the movie front, there was a the great Barbenheimer box office showdown between Christopher Nolan’s somber nuclear biopic Oppenheimer and Greta Gerwig’s neon pink Barbie movie. Spider-Man came swinging Across The Spider-Verse, John Wick shot a bunch more dudes in the face and A24 dropped yet another banger indie horror with Talk To Me. There were so many great TV shows, streaming or otherwise, it was hard to keep up, but the Succession finale had plenty of

## Fortnite Festival Review

Fortnite Festival reviewed by Luke Reilly on PlayStation 5. Also available on PlayStation 4, Xbox, Switch, and PC.
"Fortnite Festival forgets the bulk of what really made Rock Band the peak rhythm series of its era and injects the husk that’s leftover full of insidious money-extracting service game tricks and baffling design decisions. With no local shared-screen co-op, it falls at the first hurdle as a worthy peer of Harmonix’s party-game powerhouse. You can’t even see the note highways for the other players you’re online with, leaving the Main Stage mode barely feeling like multiplayer at all – and the Fuser-ish Jam Stage mode feels like a waste of effort entirely, demanding a king’s ransom to collect enough of the disgracefully expensive songs to be able to meaningfully engage with it. Binning karaoke support and charting the singing as button taps on the note highway is bewildering. Does Fortnite Festival have small glimmers of that musical magic that the incredible team at Harmo
