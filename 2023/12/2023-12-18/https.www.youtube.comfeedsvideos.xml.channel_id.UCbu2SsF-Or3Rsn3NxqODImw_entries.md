A 10 does not mean a game is perfect, but it does mean that it's a game we believe everyone should experience and play. In our opinion, no game can be considered perfect. That means you could see a game that receives a 10 despite having issues. It also means that games without obvious flaws may score below a 10. On the rare occasions when we do publish a 10 out of 10 review, that is our way of saying that no matter your preference for genre, developer, setting, or console, you owe it to yourself to find a way to play these games.

From Zelda: Ocarina of Time and The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt to Final Fantasy VII Remake and Baldur's Gate 3, here is every game that GameSpot has given a perfect score since 1998. Every one of these games comes highly recommended from us, and are still worth playing today!
