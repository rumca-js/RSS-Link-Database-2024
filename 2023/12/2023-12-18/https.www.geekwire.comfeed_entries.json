Explaining the need for the task force, the related bills cite the risk that AI will &#8220;further perpetuate bias and harm to historically excluded groups,&#8221; and note that the &#8220;federal government has not yet enacted meaningful regulations or oversight into generative artificial intelligence,&#8221; leaving the industry to largely regulate itself.
