Jeffrey Wright stars as Monk, a frustrated novelist who's fed up with the establishment profiting from \"Black\" entertainment that relies on tired and offensive tropes. To prove his point, Monk uses a pen name to write an outlandish \"Black\" book of his own, a book that propels him to the heart of hypocrisy and the madness he claims to disdain.\n\n\u25ba Lea", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5IoNK5YDoI", "date_published": "2023-12-18T18:25:57+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "Rotten Tomatoes Trailers", "album": "Rotten Tomatoes Trailers", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/Z5IoNK5YDoI/hqdefault.jpg", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCi8e0iOVk1fEOogdfu4YgfA", "title": "Night Swim Featurette - Night Swim Is...
