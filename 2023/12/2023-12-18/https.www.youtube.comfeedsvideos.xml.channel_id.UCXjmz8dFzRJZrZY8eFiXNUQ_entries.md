Not that long ago, sweeping epics running over 3 hours in run time were rare.   Today, with films like Avatar, Killers of the Flower Moon, Oppenheimer and The Justice League Snydercut, it seems too many movies are pushing past that 3 hour mark.  Filmmakers like Martin Scorsese, Quentin Tarantino, and James Cameron continue to push the limits of how long an audience can sit in a movie theater.  Which begs the question, have movies in general become too long?  And will film studios ever step in to wrangle their directors?
