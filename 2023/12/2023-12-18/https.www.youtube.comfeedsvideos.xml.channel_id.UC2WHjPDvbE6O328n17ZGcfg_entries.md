If you're a developer who wants to stay up on the latest in programming, sign up to Dev Notes completely free 👉 https://www.devnotesdaily.com/

I'm building a platform for programmers and folks interested in computer science to discuss current tech & programming news, how we can utilize it as programmers, and what it means for us and the software development industry. It's under the same umbrella as the Dev Notes newsletter, which is a newsletter for programmers and folks interested in computer science - but the platform is to foster community and encourage discussion about these topics.
