The War and Treaty are everywhere these days — and they're currently nominated for two Grammy Awards; one for Best New Artist, and another for Best American Roots Song ("Blank Page").

We were delighted to welcome them into our studio in 2018, where they performed tracks from their debut album, "Healing Tide," including this one, "Are You Ready To Love Me?"
