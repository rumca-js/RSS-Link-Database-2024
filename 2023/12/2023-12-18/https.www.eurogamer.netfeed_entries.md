Activision Blizzard is ending hybrid working for its QA testers in January, meaning employees are expected to work full-time in offices.
</p><p>
The impact of this decision has been highlighted by the ABK Workers Alliance in a new statement shared with Eurogamer.
</p><p>
QA employees in Minneapolis, Austin, and El Segundo are affected, with "many employees being forced out of the company in a soft layoff".

Leaks for Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League have moved on from a steady drip to become a flood. 
</p><p>
As I said earlier today, developer Rocksteady has been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-battling-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-leaks">battling leaks for its upcoming game since its alpha test took place in November</a>. 
</p><p>
However, the ferocity of these leaks has now increased ten-fold, and so this is another warning to mute social media and such if you want to keep the game as much a surprise as possible.

Microsoft has announced a range of offers across a selection of Xbox games, as well as its Series X/S consoles and Elite controllers.
</p><p>
If you head over to the Microsoft Store now, you will be able to save &pound;100 on an Xbox Series X (although, while this is the official line from Microsoft, I am currently seeing a deal saving &pound;110). This deal will run until 7th January.
</p><p>
You can also currently get &pound;40 off a Series S console, although this offer only runs until 24th December.

Sony has filed a patent which could see difficulty levels adapt and adjust as users play. 
</p><p>
The patent features algorithms that would be able to finely tune difficulty settings based on an individual's performance. It is interesting to see Sony patent such an idea, when similar processes are used in other games already. 
</p><p>
Regardless, this patent (which can be viewed via <a href="https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2023235090&amp;_cid=P12-LPYKPU-91525-2">World Intellectual Property Organization</a>), shows PlayStation has its eye on the future of this sort of technology.

The move follows the ongoing investigations into The Open Hand Foundation, a fundraising body created by Khalil's family.</p><p>Sabotage and Khalil had a close working relationship, with Khalil consistently giving the studio a spot in IndieLand, an annual charity stream to support The Open Hand Foundation, and <a href="https://youtu.be/u9mBsmiXR0I?t=305">supporting Sea of Stars</a> on Kickstarter.

The new TimeSplitters project recently in development at Free Radical Design was originally pitched as a battle royale game to rival Fortnite, a developer on the project has claimed. 
</p><p>
This year, however, the project then took a "massive 180" to become something else - something the studio reportedly much preferred: an expanded remake of TimeSplitters 2 with extra content and a few plot changes.
</p><p>
"Originally it was a Fortnite clone. Nobody wanted that really, not even us, but we didn't have much of a choice for a long time," the developer told fan wiki <a href="https://freeradical.fandom.com/wiki/TimeSplitters%5C_(2021)/Anonymous%5C_Interview">The Free Radical Archive</a>.

Co-chairman and co-CEO of DC Studios James Gunn has said Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League won't be the last we see of the Arkham Universe.
</p><p>
In a brief back and forth on social media platform Threads, Gunn was asked outright if Rocksteady's upcoming release would be the last game set in this universe. In response, Gunn replied: "No plans of it being the last." This post has since been removed from the platform, although it remains thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/dcuworld/status/1736461794192085176">screenshots</a> of the exchange. 
</p><p>
In another post - which remains live at the time of writing - Gunn said he was looking forward to the release of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League and "hopefully more". He added he was a "fan".

We've had Baldur's Gate 3, Zelda 2 (Bertie that is not what it's called), Cocoon, Alan Wake 2, Banished Vault, and - genuinely - so many more. We've been giddy all year at Eurogamer at the relentless quality on show. We ought to be celebrating now during this end of year period, and we will celebrate.
