After 40 years, the consequence of preaching such values and logic has turned Chinese society to become grossly power-oriented with great disparity in wealth, and polarization of society, accompanied by prevalent corruption and social values in chaos. The Chinese people, who are preoccupied with survival in an increasingly diminished space, have no time to think about human nature, morality, justice, and freedom.  
As a result, the soil of goodwill no longer exists, and the hotbeds of malice grow wild.
