In our opinion, no game can be considered perfect. That means you could see a game that receives a 10 despite having issues. It also means that games without obvious flaws may score below a 10. On the rare occasions when we do publish a 10 out of 10 review, that is our way of saying that no matter your preference for genre, developer, setting, or console, you owe it to yourself to find a way to play these games.\n\nFrom Zelda: Ocarina of Time and The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt to Final Fantasy VII Remake and Baldur's Gate 3, here is every game that GameSpot has given a perfect score since 1998. Every one of these games comes highly recommended from us, and are still worth playing today!\n\nTimestamps:\n0:00 Intro\n0:14 The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time\n0:40 Soul Calibur\n1:03 Chrono Cross\n1:31 Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3\n1:58 Grand Theft Auto IV\n2:19 Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of ", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPS0yhRxzO8", "date_published": "2023-12-18T16:00:11+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "GameSpot - YouTube", "album": "GameSpot - YouTube", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/JPS0yhRxzO8/hqdefault.jpg", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}]
