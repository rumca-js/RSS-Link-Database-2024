Explaining the need for the task force, the related bills cite the risk that AI will &#8220;further perpetuate bias and harm to historically excluded groups,&#8221; and note that the &#8220;federal government has not yet enacted meaningful regulations or oversight into generative artificial intelligence,&#8221; leaving the industry to largely regulate itself.

<br />Zulily&#8217;s website was &#8220;down for maintenance&#8221; Monday in the latest sign of the retailer&#8217;s collapse. Zulily.com redirects to Zuliy.com/password and features a bare webpage with just &#8220;Zulily&#8221; and the phrase &#8220;We are down for maintenance.&#8221; It&#8217;s unclear if the website is temporarily down or if it&#8217;s down for good. The online retailer earlier this month planned to shut down three offices, including its Seattle headquarters, and lay off more than 800 people in total. The company later announced a “going-out-of-business” sale. Last week the Seattle-based online retailer surprised some employees, notifying them via email that they were getting laid off&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/zulily-website-inaccessible-and-down-for-maintenance-following-layoffs/">Read More</a>

A statement about the abrupt closure is posted on the WNDR website, but it doesn&#8217;t provide a reason for the decision. It was also posted as an Instagram story four days ago. A public relations rep for the museum had nothing additional to share when contacted by GeekWire. &#8220;While we’ve enjoyed welcoming Seattle to experience the joy of WNDR Museum this year, we’ve made the difficult decision to close the doors of our Seattle location effective immediately,&#8221; the statement reads.&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/high-tech-art-experience-wndr-museum-closes-abruptly-in-seattle-after-8-months/">Read More</a>

The uncrewed mission, known as NS24, is due to send 33 science payloads on a roughly 10-minute-long journey to the edge of space and back from Blue Origin&#8217;s Launch Site One in West Texas, as early as 9:30 a.m. CT (7:30 a.m. PT) today. Technical snags or weather concerns could delay liftoff. For example, today&#8217;s launch time was pushed back an hour due to concerns&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/jeff-bezos-blue-origin-first-new-shepard-space/">Read More</a>
