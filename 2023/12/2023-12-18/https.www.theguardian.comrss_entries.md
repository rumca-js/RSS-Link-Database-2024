Jamie Vardy’s absence through injury meant a face-off of sorts against Wayne Rooney, the Birmingham manager, was never on the cards – and no detective work was required to identify which of these teams are favourites to win promotion to the Premier League.

<p>PM seemed outraged to be asked questions about a peer and PPE after visit to Italy and Giorgia Meloni</p><p>Rishi Sunak hadn’t felt this loved up since his early days with Akshata. He’d only gone to the Brothers of Italy convention in Rome out of curiosity and to return a favour. Giorgia Meloni had been the only world leader to make the effort to turn up to his spectacularly pointless AI summit in Bletchley. The one where he had come to the stunning conclusion that AI could be both good and bad. You can’t buy that level of insight. Thankfully.</p><p>What he hadn’t expected was an instant attraction. The connection that comes between soulmates. For the first time in ages, Rish! felt truly seen. Truly heard. He felt complete. Someone with whom he could share his innermost fascisty thoughts without fear of being judged. Who would listen to his dreams of sending refugees to Rwanda and make them her own. By the end of the weekend they had had no need of a verbal language. Their minds a

<p>Fans made their feelings clear about league negotiations with private equity firms and Bayern made a statement, too</p><p>Welcome to the winter of uncertainty. This was a weekend on which Bundesliga fans united to protest against the league’s clubs voting to press ahead and negotiate with private equity firms to sell a portion of international television rights, anathema to supporters who believe fans, rather than big business, should steer the direction of the game in Germany. There were 12 minutes of silence at the stadiums – representing the fans’ role as the 12th man – and the throwing of tennis balls and chocolate coins (Bochum’s Takuma Asano unwrapped and ate one of the coins, presumably giving him the extra energy to rattle in a volley and open the scoring in the 3-0 win over Union Berlin).</p><p>In a culture where supporter implication, and atmosphere, is the key tenet, there is little more eerie than a full stadium fallen silent.

With 31 shots, Arsenal had an xG of 2.5 but were all too often restricted by poor decision-making (they only registered eight attempts on target) or denied by the brilliance of a defence who put everything on the line to keep the ball out. It was perhaps telling that the Spurs goalkeeper, Barbora Votikova, was awarded the Player of the Match award on her WSL debut. Tottenham created just five opportunities throughout the game, scoring one of their three shots on target, as they continue to develop under the guidance of Robert Vilahamn. Martha Thomas’s goal was a quintessential team effort, a flowing move involving six passes from back to front that delighted her manager. “Dear ChatGPT, show me how Tottenham Hotspur want to scor

<p>Funny, blunt and totally gripping, the third and final series of Sally Wainwright’s crime show is that rarest of things: a drama so thrilling it more than lives up to the hype<br /><strong>• Warning: this article contains plot spoilers<br /></strong>• <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/series/2023-in-tv">More 2023 in TV</a><br />• <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/series/2023-in-culture">More on the best culture of 2023</a></p><p>It took seven years for Happy Valley’s majestic third and final act to reach our screens, but it turned out to be well worth the wait. There are few, if any, crime series like it: it was funny, blunt, tender, terrifying and so gripping that for six weeks, it revived the idea that television audiences might still watch a drama together, all at once, at the same time, because watching it together made it even more thrilling and even more tense. This is likely the last we will have seen of Catherine Cawood, which is bittersweet – th

<p>From chalk to rubbers and clay, there are a variety of reasons why those with pica syndrome yearn to eat non-foodstuffs. But is this dangerous?</p><p>Mary (not her real name), a 20-year-old from Ireland, has just kicked her habit – of eating firelighters. “I got through a box of individually wrapped ones every six months for most of my adolescence,” she says, “but during exam season I would go through a box every three weeks. I would allow the firelighters to dry out in the box after opening them, as that was how I preferred them.”</p><p>Mary has pica (pronounced pike-a) syndrome, often classified as an eating disorder that involves consuming non-food items. But even within this condition, her version is unusual, leaving her feeling isolated. “I haven’t heard of anyone else experiencing anything like it,” she says. “Internet searches have led to poison hotline phone numbers or pregnancy forums, because expecting mothers often crave the smell of firelighters.

<p>Raphaël Varane excelled and Manchester City stumbled but Tom Lockyer incident put everything in perspective</p><p>Sometimes, football has to come second. When Tom Lockyer collapsed in the 65th minute of Luton’s game against Bournemouth, the match rightly became a distant afterthought. The Hatters’ official social media post actually apologised to supporters of both teams when announcing the abandonment of the game, but there was no need, such was the understanding shown by every part of the Vitality Stadium. It must have been an incredibly distressing situation for all, and particularly strange for those connected with Bournemouth. Not that you would have known. Praise is deservedly being dished out to Philip Billing, who was the first to dash over to the stricken Lockyer, and to his teammate Dominic Solanke, who was seen calling urgently for medical support. The speed with which they grasped the severity of the situation was commendable and they played a part in getting Lockyer t

Older ones, too. But back then it was watched by more than 10 million viewers each week. And such was its popularity within sport that one longstanding producer, Mike Adley, told Keating that no one had ever turned it down – although <a href="https:/

<p>Tired of hearing everyone talk, with false humility, about what they’ve accomplished over the past year? Me too</p><p>Be careful out there: it’s boasting season. Maybe you’ve already been cornered at a party, received your first round-robin email, opened a card to find a typed insert of “family news”, or stumbled on a social media post where someone lists their 2023 accomplishments with the baffling hashtag #humbled (you’re not, are you? Quite the opposite).</p><p>If not, stay alert. It’s sometimes straightforward – proud announcements of prizes and promotions – but more often, it’s subtler. “We must be mad, taking on this ramshackle Georgian pile by the sea, renovations are a nightmare because it’s in Pevsner.” “Oh, Harriet never has time to speak to us now she’s a Fulbright scholar, ha ha!”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/dec/18/boasting-season-is-upon-us-and-it-cant-end-soon-enough">Continue reading...</a>

A lot of people don’t; according to the Financial Conduct Authority, in July this year, £260bn was sitting in accounts paying 1% or less in interest. “Don’t just accept what your high street bank is offering,” says Anna Bowes, the co-founder of Savings Champion.

<p>This corner of Ireland has been bucking the trend of rural decline for decades, and continues to draw in creative types  in search of a more sustainable way of life</p><p>One summer, many years ago when I was 17, I met a Dutch girl in a pub who was backpacking around Ireland. She said she was staying in hostels and was off to Doolin in County Clare the next day. Somehow, I hadn’t realised it was that easy to strike out and see the world. The next morning I took the bus to Doolin and began a lifelong love of independent travel and the open road. I never saw the Dutch girl again despite a full search of every pub in the village.</p><p>North Clare and the Burren blew my 17-year-old mind. I still remember the extraordinary quality of the light as it burst through the tapestry of clouds looking out across the limestone fields to the Aran Islands. There’s an air about the place. The area attracted woolly hat-wearing traditional musicians and every village seemed to have a pottery studio

What connects you with your country, and makes you feel it is yours? What gives you a sense of identity and belonging? It’s the physical things, of course – where you live, where you were born, where your family and friends reside. But underlying those practical aspects, I suspect, are all the other things that you don’t think about, that you take for granted. The music, the literature, the humour, the art and cinema and TV – all the abstract touchstones of an identity that form a connective tissue between you and your country.</p><p>I ask because the corollary of the question “what makes a people?” is “what erases one?” And what is unfolding in Gaza has made that question an urgent one. Because alongside the horrors of death and displacement, something else is happening – something existential
