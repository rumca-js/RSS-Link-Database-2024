<p>Google is giving anyone who has a WiFi-only Stadia controller lying around an additional year to convert it to Bluetooth. The deadline to do this was previously until the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-stadia-controller-bluetooth-unlock-214830717.html"><ins>end of this year</ins></a>, but Google is now extending it to December 31, 2024.</p>
<p>Google <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-shutting-down-stadia-162704135.html"><ins>axed</ins></a> Stadia, its cloud gaming service, at the beginning of this year.

<p>Trevor Milton, the disgraced founder of Nikola, was just sentenced to four years in prison on three counts of fraud.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In October 2022, a jury <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nikola-founder-trevor-milton-guilty-fraud-223109177.html">found Milton guilty</a> of one count of securities fraud and two counts of wire fraud. Milton faced up to 60 years in prison. Prosecutors asked the judge for an 11-year prison sentence and a $5 million fine, according to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/18/business/ev-startups-trevor-milton-nikola.html"><em>The New York Times</em></a>, while the defense argued for probation.&nbsp;</p>

The first deliveries of the “performance SUV” are expected in early 2024.</p>
<p>The automaker said earlier this year it would <a href="https://www.engadget.com/acuras-evs-will-be-sold-exclusively-online-starting-in-2024-140054959.html">shift to online-only sales of Acura EVs</a> starting in 2024, and ZDX preorders appear to reflect that. The company said the EV is available through “a new, omni-channel digital sales process,” which buyers can use themselves at home, or receive assistance in using at Acura dealers (although the EVs won't be available at the dealership itself.)</p>

<p>VF Corporation reported in <a href="https://www.vfc.com/investors/financial-information/sec-filings">a Securities and Exchange Commission filing</a> on Monday that it had been hit by a cyberattack. The company owns a slew of apparel brands, including Vans, North Face, Timberland, Dickies and more — and it warns the disruption could affect your holiday shopping.&nbsp;</p>
<p>VF first noticed &quot;unauthorized occurrences&quot; on its IT systems on December 13, it said in a statement to Engadget. While it began to mitigate the damage, VF found that the hackers had encrypted some of its IT systems and stole personal data. It's trying to come up with work arounds so that people can still buy from VF brands, but the $7 billion company said the attack messed with its ability to fulfill orders.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Flipboard is the latest mainstream app to officially join the fediverse, the collection of decentralized services that run on the ActivityPub protocol. The news reading app, which has been experimenting with Mastodon for nearly a year, now plans to become <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://flipboard.medium.com/flipboard-begins-to-federate-c56ec788feaa"><ins>fully interoperable</ins></a> with Mastodon and the rest of the fediverse.</p>
<p>The news reading app is starting with the accounts of about two dozen publishers, including Polygon, Medium, Semafor, Kotaku and Mental Floss, whose Flipboard content will be discoverable across the fediverse. By next month, the company expects all public Flipboard accounts will be federated, meaning anyone on an ActivityPub-powered app will be able to view their posts and interact with them.</p>

<p>As a precocious teen looking to improve my college application, I sat in on a business studies class. I figured taking two extra A-Levels at night school alongside those I took during the day would make me irresistible to admissions tutors. The class I watched examined if it was worth a large factory keeping its own trucks and drivers in-house rather than outsourcing them. The data showed selling the trucks and firing the workers was more expensive in the long run, and yoked the company to the whims of any third-party logistics company in the local area. Not to mention, if you don’t own a mission-critical component of your business, you’re a lot less powerful when negotiating with your suppliers. But the teacher, and the class, all agreed it was smart to sell it all because it made a bigger profit in the quarter and was cheaper for the next two years. These people had never considered if something bad would happen, and how to prepare for it. It was at this point I realized my valu

This <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-app-store-developers-contingent-pricing-for-subscriptions-222205906.html">contingent pricing model</a> will let developers offer discounts to customers who already have subscriptions to other services, be it those developers’ own apps or connected partner apps.</p>
<p>According to<em> 9to5Mac</em>, Apple says these bundled discounts will be highly visible to customers both on the App Store and “in off-platform marketing channels” — so elsewhere too. It’s starting with a select group of participants before rolling out to more developers “in the coming months.”</p>

The news comes 12 months after the two sides <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-picking-up-tv-film-rights-warhammer-40000-130756969.html">reached an agreement in principle</a> to develop adaptations of the miniature wargame for big and small screens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The companies have now inked a full agreement, which gives Amazon the exclusive rights to develop films and TV shows based on the intellectual property. In turn, the adaptations could help Games Workshop attract new <em>Warhammer 40K </em>tabletop players.</p>

<p>An EV from Chinese manufacturer Nio will soon go on sale with a &quot;semi-solid state&quot; 150kWh battery (140kWh usable) that's the largest in any passenger car, <a href="https://carnewschina.com/2023/12/17/nio-et7-with-150-kwh-semi-solid-state-battery-achieves-a-1044-km-range/"><em>Car News China</em></a> reported. To show much range that will deliver, Nio CEO William Li drove a prototype version of the <a href="https://www.nio.com/et7">ET7</a> 1,044km (650 miles) in 14 hours, a distance surpassing many gas-powered vehicles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The test was run in relatively cool temperatures (between 28 – 54 F) and livestreamed. Driving was done mainly in semi-autonomous (or Navigate-on-Pilot+, as Nio calls it), and speed-limited to 90 km/h (56 MPH). The average speed was 83.9 km/h (a respectable 52.4 MPH), with a travel time of 12.4 hours excluding stops.</p>

<p>Earlier today, Scottish adventurers Chris and Julie Ramsey were finally able to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C0-LflGA5qL/">announce</a> their completion of the nine-month, 17,000-mile <a href="https://poletopoleev.com/">&quot;Pole To Pole EV&quot;</a> expedition, the world's first drive from the 1823 Magnetic North Pole to South Pole — on an electric car, no less. The couple actually reached their destination on December 15 (Friday), but they could only share the news after re-establishing satellite connection later. This feat was achieved using a <a href="https://global.nissannews.com/en/releases/north-pole-to-south-pole-with-nissan-ariya">Nissan Ariya e-4ORCE</a> electric vehicle, which was modified by Icelandic specialist Arctic Trucks — mainly with larger 39-inch tires plus matching wheel arches, along with some ice-friendly gear and body reinforcement work. The powertrain and suspension were mostly stock — just with a lifted height, according to <a href="https://elect
