<p>Manchester City are favourites but the 2025 revamp could give meaningful football for Saudi clubs against Europe’s best</p><p>There was a misguided sense of inevitability when Karim Benzema prepared to take a penalty as the first half of Al-Ittihad’s Club World Cup quarter-final against Al-Ahly wound down. Presumably Benzema would conform to type and level the score; after that the expensively assembled local side, supported by a deafening mass of yellow-clad ultras, could be expected to pull clear and move closer to a dream final with Manchester City.</p><p>It turns out things are not always that straightforward. Benzema’s poor effort was parried by Mohamed El Shenawy; <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/dec/15/al-ahly-send-al-ittihad-out-of-club-world-cup-as-benzema-misses-penalty">Al-Ahly went on to win 3-1</a> on Friday evening and, by full-time, most of the home support had left.

<p>Paulo Fonseca’s side have always had potential, but now they have a chance to  ensconce themselves on the league’s podium </p><p>Lille’s 1-1 draw with Paris Saint-Germain was typical of recent form. Competitive and well-balanced while boasting quality performers, the bigger occasions aren’t a problem for Paulo Fonseca. It’s the details that <em>Les Dogues</em> struggle with. Individual errors have cost Lille points and positions over the last 18 months, but this season could yet present an opportunity for them to cement themselves as PSG’s leading rival.</p><p>Having matched the champions for an hour, the Lille right-back Bafodé Diakité’s unneeded lunge on Lucas Hernández resulted in a penalty. Such mistakes have frustrated Fonseca in 2023 and his side were again punished as Kylian Mbappé neatly converted. Despite having more shots (15 to nine), a useful share of possession (41%) and greater expected goals (1.91 to 1.39), Lille trailed into injury time.</p> <a href="https://www.th

Georgian film director who was the true heir to Jean Renoir, Jacques Tati and Luis Buñuel<p>At the time when the film Favourites of the Moon was released in France in 1985, little was known in western Europe about its Georgian director, Otar Iosseliani, who has died aged 89. He had already made three features and several shorts in the Soviet Union, where he had suffered some censorship, the prime reason for his becoming an exile in France in 1982. For many, Favourites of the Moon, shot in Paris in French, was their first entry into the singular world of Iosseliani.</p><p>His self-described “abstract comedies” are understated and incisive explorations of human absurdity, always faithful to his idiosyncratic vision, and discarding any kind of cohesive narrative. Iosseliani observed his characters through behaviour rather than dialogue. His use of sound and silence, and his complex movements of people, animals and objects made him the true heir to Jean Renoir, Jacques Tati and Luis Buñu

Clearer in the film’s more universal right-people-wrong-time romance but also in the more specific, and knottier, queerness. It was a rare, giddy uplift to see young gay men fall headfirst for each other with such believable and unfettered intimacy but their affection existed in a world full of caveats – where to kiss, how to act, who to be – and it was only in privacy that they could really be themselves. “When I’m at home I’m absolutely fine,” Tom Cullen’s Russell says. “I’m happy being

<p>A fanciful, caramel-topped set custard that wouldn’t be out of place on an old-fashioned dessert trolley</p><p><strong><br /></strong>It was no doubt intended for drinks, but with two oak shelves and brass wheels, to me it looked like a perfect pudding trolley. It was also €150 and being used as a display for an enormous number of small things at a flea market. A good thing, too, otherwise I might have brought it home instead of the chair we actually needed. I regretted my decision, though; while I’m sure it wasn’t an Osvaldo Borsani bar trolley, it damned well looked like one. So I went back a few days later, only to find it with a “reserved” sign. Now I feel regret, and resentment towards the stranger with my trolley.</p><p>This movable cart would have finally allowed me to recreate my fantasy pudding trolley, a cross between the Ballymaloe trolley in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/21/myrtle-allen-obituary">Myrtle Allen</a>’s book – with Irish apple c
