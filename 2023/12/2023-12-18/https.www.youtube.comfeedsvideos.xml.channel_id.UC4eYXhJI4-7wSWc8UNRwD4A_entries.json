There's calculated intent behind every word and note of this 30-minute set and I learned that his love for golf also runs deep during our initial meeting. He was playing a round and had difficulty dividing his attention between the plan and the course. Three days before the show, amid rehearsals, I got a call from Facemob asking, \"What if I brought Mike Dean?\" My expectations were already high, but that final addition set the stage for something special.\n\nMike Dean provided unmatched authenticity, and their shared stories added sentimental value to this performance. After all, his signature keys and synths can be heard on most of Scarface's classics and countless Rap-A-Lot records. Here, we get a rare glimpse of Scarface the conductor, bouncing through multiple eras of his catalog including \"On My Block,\" \"Mary Jane\" and the bone-chilling \"I Seen a Man Die.\"\n\n", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajNYTJcF6rE", "date_published": "2023-12-18T10:00:02+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "NPR Music", "album": "NPR Music", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/ajNYTJcF6rE/hqdefault.jpg", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}]
