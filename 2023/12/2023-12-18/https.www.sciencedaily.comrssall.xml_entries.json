However, the difference between the two bears to only a few degrees in temperature. A team of astronomers has achieved a world's first by managing to simulate the entirety of the runaway greenhouse process which can transform the climate of a planet from idyllic and perfect for life, to a place more than harsh and hostile. The scientists have also demonstrated that from initial stages of the process, the atmospheric structure and cloud coverage undergo significant changes, leading to an almost-unstoppable and very complicated to reverse runaway greenhouse effect. On Earth, a global average temperature rise of just a few tens of degrees, subsequent to a slight rise of the Sun's luminosity, would be sufficient to initiate this phenomenon and to make our planet inhabitable.", "link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2023/12/231218130016.htm", "date_published": "2023-12-18T13:00:16+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "Latest Science News -- ScienceDaily", "album": "Latest Science News -- ScienceDaily", "user": null, "language": "en-us", "thumbnail": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/scidaily-logo-rss.png", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/rss/all.xml", "title": "15 most pressing issues for conservation, including invertebrate decline and changing marine ecosystems", "description": "Since 2009, the Cambridge Conservation Initiative has coordinated an annual horizon scan, a well-established method for predicting which threats, changes, and technologies will have the biggest impact on biological conservation in the following year.
