He was also determined to bring a political edge into a style associated with gently languid songs about young women and sunshine. Interviewed for the BBC series <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/musictv/brasilbrasil/episodes/" title="">Brasil, Brasil</a> in 2007, he told me that bossa was “the discreet charm of the bourgeoisie … something that came from the middle class for
