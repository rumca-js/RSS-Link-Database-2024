The election for the 16th ROC President, Vice President, and 11th Legislative  Yuan will be held on January 13, 2024, with an estimated 19.5 million voters. 
Some scholars studying the CCP's information and cognitive warfare have warned that the CCP could play a role in the outcome of the election by influencing as little as 3% of the vote, or about 500,000 votes.  
China's economy is rapidly sliding into recession, the political situation is unstable, and the people are looking for change, all of which are signs that the CCP is on the verge of disintegration. Perhaps this is the last chance for the CCP. Red China and Taiwan seem to be in a race. This is an election that will determine whether Taiwan will fall or not.
