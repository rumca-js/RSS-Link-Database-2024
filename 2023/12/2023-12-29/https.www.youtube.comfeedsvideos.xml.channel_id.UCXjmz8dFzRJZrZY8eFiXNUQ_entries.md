The Universal Monsters are some of the greatest horror icons of all time.  Monsters like Dracula, Frakenstein and The Wolf Man have been brought to the big screen several times since their inception.  Though in 2010, The Wolf Man was adapted into quite possibly the worst attempt ever made.  The Wolfman was not only a terrible reincarnation of The Wolf Man, it was one of the biggest financial failures in history at the time.
