<p>I guess democracy is so sacred she is out there defending it. Just not sacred enough to be de facto Democratic. You know, she means in the North Korean kind of way. That form of Democracy. </p><p>Alright, so why did the left-wing Secretary of State from Maine decide

And while they claim they want to help the little guy, they really could care less about those who cannot speak or defend themselves. </p><p>Progressives will prioritize “animal rights” and simultaneously promote abortion. </p><p>It is a federal crime to destroy a bald eagle's eggs. While it is promoted as some holy act to murder your defenseless unborn child. That is about all the logic you will find on the left. And by that I mean no logic at all. </p><p>These people are also easily brainwashed. That is because they don’t have a value system that dictates their worldview like people on the right more often do. They believe that there are no universal truths. But even if that were true, which it is not, that would be a universal truth. But that is beside the point right now

Not the other way around. </p><p>Why on earth would it be considered “positive” to gain so much weight you cannot even fit in an airline seat? It is not. There is nothing positive about that. It is all based on lies. And no matter how many people on the left try and convince people otherwise, it is nothing more than a lie. No one would EVER choose to be 200 pounds overweight rather than be as fit as a model. No one. If they say they do, they are lying. </p><p>Just like most leftist causes, the body positivity movement is dangerous because it teaches kids

Not unlike with <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/kayla-lemieux-without-her-breasts" target="_blank">2022 Woman of the Year Kayla Lemieux</a>, it's done with a hefty amount of sarcasm. A satirical reference to the insane things were expected to accept, lest we be labelled a -phobe. </p><p>Justin "I Feel Pretty" Trudeau's government is serious. And this year gave an award to a transwoman for her outstanding work in diversity. Even though, the same trans woman had Canada's OLDEST women's rap

It made observers wonder if the stroke made him smarter. Turns out, it's basic math. </p><p>As <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/democrats-flipping-republican-pennsylvania-warning-biden-1855129" target="_blank">reported by Newsweek</a>, a MASSIVE amount of Democrats are switching their party registration in Pennsylvania.</p><blockquote>The most up-to-date voter registration data from the Pennsylvania Department of State shows that 35,589 registered Democrats have switched to their party affiliation Republican this year, as of December 18, 2023. Comparably, 15,622 registered Republicans have switched their party affiliation to Democrat. There
