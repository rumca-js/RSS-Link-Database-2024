The best linear games use a combination of intriguing storytelling, good pacing, and compelling mechanics to keep a player entertained for hours on end. \n\nWith this video, we will be taking a look back at the wonderful year that was 2023 and list down 15 of the best linear games that released this year.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D41Dh94ycQs", "date_published": "2023-12-29T15:30:07+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "GamingBolt", "album": "GamingBolt", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/D41Dh94ycQs/hqdefault.jpg", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "Top 23 Best PS5 Games of 2023 YOU NEED TO PLAY", "description": "Ordinarily, we expect any given year to be dotted with multiple major releases by first party PlayStation studios, but 2023 was a different year in that regard, with Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man 2 being the only flagship coming from Sony\u2019s first party lineup. In spite of that lighter pace, however, it has somehow turned out to be an incredible year for the console- perhaps even its best ever so far, in the early legs of its lifecycle. \n\nThird party developers from across the industry obviously had a big hand to play in that, but the end result is a lineup of games that, over the course of the year, has added a litany of gems to PS5\u2019s already remarkable library.
