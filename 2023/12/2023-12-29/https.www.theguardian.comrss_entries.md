Querying the head of pastoral care, I asked when the church would ordain women. He concurred it would happen, likely in “300 years”. This is glacial terrain when it&nbsp;comes to major change. I believe that Pope Francis understands that the church has to go in incremental steps.

The all-knowing computer – sometimes benign, usually malevolent – was a staple of the science fiction genre long before any such entity was feasible in the real world. That moment may now be approaching faster than societies can draft appropriate rules. In 2023, the capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) came to the attention of a wide audience well beyond tech circles, thanks largely to ChatGPT (which launched in November 2022) and similar products.</p><p>Given how rapidly progress in the field is advancing, that fascination is sure to accelerate in 2024, coupled with alarm at some of the more apocalyptic scenarios possible if the technology is not adequately regulated.

Marks &amp; Spencer and the Whisky Exchange, for example, are both saying that brandy is big, whereas Waitrose is championing Japanese whisky and rosé vermouth. (M&amp;S is also currently pushing tequila, though that seems more suited to the summer.)</p><p>Another trend I’m not totally convinced by is lighter reds.

<p>Style moves more slowly than you think – jump too soon, and your new look will be lost on most people</p><p>Tis the season for end of year quizzes, so here goes with my quickfire version. Just one question, in fact, and it’s multiple choice. Is the best time to start wearing a new fashion trend (a) before anyone else, (b) when Kate Moss/Bella Hadid (delete as age-appropriate) starts wearing it or (c) no rush – six months later works.</p><p>The answer is c. Yes, you read that right. The best time to get on board with a new look is not when it is news, but a season or two later. Being late to a trend is not just acceptable, it is positively advisable. There are no prizes for being first to the finishing line in fashion. Instead of charging straight in on the first wave of a trend, it’s much more chic to hold your horses.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/dec/29/want-to-keep-up-with-fashion-then-wait-six-months-to-try-a-trend">Continue reading...</a>

He co-founded the Edgar Evans Club in 2015 for ex-service personnel to take part in eccentric events in sleepy towns across the UK and raise money for local charities.
