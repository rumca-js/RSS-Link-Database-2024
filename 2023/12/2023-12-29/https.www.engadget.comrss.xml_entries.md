<p>Donald Trump’s former “fixer,” Michael Cohen, used <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-bard-ai-hands-on-a-work-in-progress-with-plenty-of-caveats-170956025.html">Google Bard</a> to cite made-up legal cases that ended up in a federal court. <em>The New York Times</em> <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/29/nyregion/michael-cohen-ai-fake-cases.html">reported</a> Friday that Cohen admitted in unsealed court papers that he passed on documents referencing bogus cases to his lawyer, who then relayed them to a federal judge. Cohen reportedly wrote in the sworn declaration he hadn’t stayed on top of “emerging trends (and related risks) in legal technology.”</p>
<p>Cohen’s legal team filed the paperwork in a motion asking for an early end to court supervision from his 2018 campaign finance case, for which he <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/michael-cohen-sentenced-3-years-prison">served</a> three years in prison. Af

This week, we're seeing a few sale prices that are still live from Black Friday; snag those before they inevitably go back up. A few new discounts have popped up that actually beat lows from November's shopping holiday, including a Prime-only deal on <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL0FsbC1OZXctRWNoby1TaG93LTgvZHAvQjBCTFMzWTYzMj90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby01YWEtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjdhM

<p>A federal judge in California has <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/x-corp-injunction-ruling.pdf">shot down</a> Elon Musk’s attempt to invalidate a state social media law, first <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/29/24018645/x-twitter-elon-musk-content-moderation-law-california-decision">reported by</a> <em>The Verge</em>. The state’s AB 587 requires social companies to publish their content moderation policies, something Musk’s X (formerly Twitter) claimed violated the First Amendment. US District Judge William Shubb wrote on Thursday, “It does not appear that the requirement is unjustified or unduly burdensome within the context of First Amendment law.”</p>
<p>X’s lawyers had argued the law was unconstitutional and would lead to censorship. AB 587 “has both the purpose and likely effect of pressuring companies such as X Corp. to remove, demonetize, or deprioritize constitutionally-protect

<p>The last few years have been, to put it mildly, rough. And 2023 continued to bring sad tidings. Amid the humanitarian crisis that is the Palestine-Israeli conflict, plus increased fears around the credibility and reliability of AI and Elon Musk’s ongoing meltdown, tech’s biggest players also suffered their fair share of losses. This year, we saw the demise of the E3 gaming convention, the deterioration of popular online forums and the decline of cryptocurrencies, Silicon Valley banks and financial institutions. Not to mention the poor neighbors of the Twitter office in San Francisco who had to endure obnoxious, potentially epilepsy-triggering lights flashing from the building. While we can happily say “good riddance” to many of these things, it is with some sadness that we bid farewell and condolences to some of this year’s worst developments.</p>

The CineBeam Qube has plenty of high-tech bells and whistles, but with a stylish design that LG calls “minimalist.&quot; There's also a handle that resembles a crank.</p>
<p>Yeah this thing has an actual handle. The CineBeam Qube is built for portability. It’s lightweight, at around three pounds, and the square form factor makes it easy to place just about anywhere.&nbsp;The 360-degree rotatable handle also helps with placement. LG’s calling it “one of the smallest projectors available.”</p>

<p>Recent years have brought an influx of self-proclaimed “<a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/what-makes-a-cozy-game-cozy">cozy games</a>,” video games explicitly designed to invoke good vibes. That said, being cozy isn’t the same as being good. To aid those who'd like some help winding down after a long day, we’ve rounded up a few chill games that strike the right balance: ones that purposefully deemphasize fail states, violence, overwhelming grinds, intense competition and other aggressive urges, but aren't overly cute for the sake of it or so stripped-down that they're boring. ​​Here are some of the best relaxing games you can play on your Nintendo Switch, PlayStation, Xbox, PC or smartphone.</p>

From Elon Musk’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/elon%2520musk/">nonstop shenanigans</a> to the constant launches in the generative AI race, the last twelve months was packed with news.

<p>Google’s Chrome has long featured the ability to launch the browser in Incognito mode, offering a seemingly blank slate for your internet browsing, away from your usual cookies, forms and web history. But that seemingly didn’t mean Google wasn’t keeping an eye on where you were browsing.</p>
<p>The company faced a lawsuit in 2020 that accused it of tracking Chrome users' activities even when they were using Incognito mode. Google has now <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-agrees-to-settle-5-billion-lawsuit-accusing-it-of-tracking-incognito-users-042435935.html">agreed to settle the complaint</a> that originally sought $5 billion in damages, after failing to get the suit dismissed.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs said Google used tools like its Analytics product, apps and browser plug-ins to monitor users. By tracking someone on Incognito, the company was falsely making people believe that they could control the information that they were willing to share with it.</p>
