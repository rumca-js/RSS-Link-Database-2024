This is the world’s largest earthquake simulator, here’s how it works. For a free trial to Shopify go to https://www.shopify.com/veritasium.

If you’re looking for a molecular modeling kit, head to https://ve42.co/SnatomsV to try Snatoms – a kit I invented where the atoms snap together magnetically.
