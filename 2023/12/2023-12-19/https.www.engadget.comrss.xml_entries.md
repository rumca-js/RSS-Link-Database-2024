<p>Meta has fixed a bug that temporarily prevented some Threads users in Canada from reading and sharing news on the app, a company spokesperson told Engadget. Even though Meta pulled news content from Canadian users‚Äô Facebook and Instagram feeds earlier this year, the block hasn‚Äôt carried over to Threads.</p>
<p>But a number of Threads users wondered if that had changed when they began to see alerts that suggested otherwise. ‚ÄúPeople in Canada can‚Äôt view this content,‚Äù a notice with Threads branding read. ‚ÄúContent from news publishers can‚Äôt be viewed in Canada in response to Canadian government legislation.‚Äù</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It‚Äôs unclear how widespread the bug was or how long it was happening. Reports of the issue seemed to crop up on Monday, with some users still unable to view links as of Tuesday morning. ‚ÄúWell... that sucks. @meta is escalating their news blocking in Canada, previously only on Facebook and Instagram, now on Threads,‚Äù Pedro Marques wrote

<p>The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has found that eBay has violated the rights of unionized workers at TCGPlayer, a trading card marketplace owned by the company. This comes in response to charges filed by the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cwa-union-files-another-unfair-labor-charge-against-ebay-owned-tcgplayer-160641406.html"><ins>Communications Workers of America</ins></a> back in March of this year. eBay has allegedly refused to recognize TCGPlayer‚Äôs worker union and it delayed participating in any bargaining practices and it has also refused to divulge any information with the group that the union is legally entitled to.</p>
<p>As part of its examination of the issue, the NLRB said that because eBay and TCGPlayer broke the law, the company must face legal consequences for its union-busting practices. The union, which <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tcgplayer-workers-form-ebay-first-union-095615128.html"><ins>officially formed in March</ins></a> following numerous

<p>This was an uncrewed mission, but it carried 33 science payloads into low orbit, more than half of them from NASA. The launch allowed for a few minutes of zero gravity in which researchers conducted remote studies on these payloads. For instance, a payload from <a href="https://twitter.com/HB_Robotics/status/1735721652527436180">Honeybee Robotics</a> studied the strength of planetary soils under differing gravity conditions.

<p>The year had started so well for robotaxis. Cruise and Waymo came into 2023 riding high on fresh investments from General Motors and Google, respectively, as well as rapidly growing interest from the general public and a downright rabid rate of adoption by city governments. Things were looking up, very up, for the burgeoning self-driving vehicle industry! Then a driverless Crusie taxi accidentally dragged a hit-and-run victim down a San Francisco street for a few dozen feet and everything just sort of went to shit from there. So fragile, these Next Big Things. Let‚Äôs take a look back through the year that was to see how autonomous taxi tech might recover from this catastrophe.</p>
<h2>Cruise (Out of) Control</h2>
<p>Cruise came into this year looking like a nigh-on unstoppable force of transportational change as the core of GM's self-driving efforts. The company received a $1.5 billion investment from the automaker in March 2022 after GM spent $2.1 buying equity ownership for the s

<p>This was a year of upheaval in video games. The industry has shapeshifted over the past 12 months, and it‚Äôs not all due to Microsoft‚Äôs lengthy acquisition of Activision, Blizzard and King. While Xbox executives were defending the legality of a $69 billion deal that would create the third-largest video game studio in the world, smaller companies were firing staff and shutting down entire teams, even amid fervent collective-bargaining efforts. It‚Äôs been a wild ride.</p>
<p>In 2023, the main factors molding the video game landscape were consolidation, layoffs and unionization, with each of these phenomena feeding into each other. This past year, the video game industry shrank, even as it grew financially.</p>

The company will suspend sales online this week and at Apple retail locations after December 24. Ho ho ho.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs all down to a patent dispute over the wearables‚Äô blood oxygen sensor. Cast your minds back: Medical tech company Masimo sued Apple in 2021 for alleged violations of light-based blood-oxygen monitoring patents. In October, the ITC upheld a judge‚Äôs ruling from earlier this year that the Apple Watch did violate Masimo‚Äôs patents. The ITC‚Äôs order blocks all Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 imports to the US after December 25.</p>

The Board overturned the company's original decision to remove two pieces of content from both sides of the conflict. Since it supported Meta's subsequent move to restore the posts on Facebook and Instagram, no further action is expected from the company. However, the Board's review cast a spotlight on how Meta's reliance on automated tools could prevent people from sharing important information.
