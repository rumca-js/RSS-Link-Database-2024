## Boston Now One Step Closer To Allowing ILLEGAL Citizens To Vote In Local Elections

Which is a very sensible and fair rule to have. Why should we start allowing people to vote who don’t have a stake in this country to the extent a native-born citizen or someone who worked very hard to earn that right does? And that is just on the surface level of concern. How can we know that noncitizens or “residents” want what is best for this country? If we begin to allow foreigners to vote in our elections, we are de facto allowing them to at least contribute to where the future of this country goes. This subsequently makes the votes of actual citizens meaningless. </p><p>This is also why the very woke City of Boston has decided it will allow residents with “legal status” to vote. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

It is not news that many on the left have disliked Chick-fil-A for quite some time now. The <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/why-do-liberals-target-chick-fil-a" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">founder </a>of Chick-fil-A was a very religious man. That is why he decided to keep the restaurant closed on Sundays.
