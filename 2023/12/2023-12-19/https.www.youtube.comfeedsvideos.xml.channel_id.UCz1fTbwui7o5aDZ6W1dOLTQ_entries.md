The legendary Baba Yaga has been through one horror after another in his first four chapters. After John Wick Chapter 4, it seemed the journey was finally over for the legendary assassin. His soul was free from the infamous High Table, his friends were got everything they wanted, and Wick had seemingly redeemed himself for all the wrong he'd committed. In the end, one man had defied the High Table and won - another impossible task. A perfect ending for such a fun action packed journey.

But then John Wick Chapter 5 was announced. Normally, this would be excellent news - but after Chapter 4's perfect, not to mention, definitive ending - where can Chapter 5 go without ruining the character, the plot, and everything Wick worked for? Let's find out.
