		An audit of AI implementations by major departments of the U.S. government has found that not all planned, in-production or in-use algorithms adhere to White House safety and transparency requirements.

The audit was conducted by the Congress' Government Accountability Office, which examines operations of the legislative branch. It suggested 35 recommendations.

GAO officials looked at current and planned uses of AI by 23 agencies. They also wanted to see how accurate and complete AI reporting is and how closely agencies complied with AI laws, <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202310/trying-to-domesticate-ai-us-un-issue-policy-marching-orders">policies and guidance</a>.

		The Homeland Security Department is working on a digital ID for refugees and asylum seekers that is based on privacy-enhancing technology.

Mason Clutter, DHS' chief privacy officer, was speaking about privacy-enhancing technology (PET) when it came up during an <a href="https://events.govexec.com/identity-management/on-demand-detail/2486/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">online forum</a> hosted last week by the trade publication GovExec.

Clutter said too many people forget that a "key component of privacy is security." Privacy violations can result in data breaches and worse, she said.

"PETs are our zero trust," Clutter said. "It has become a key initiative for us across the department."

Her team is responsible for policies and programs to protect DHS employees' biometrics and ot

		South Africa’s national statistics agency (Statistics South Africa, or Stats SA) has indicated that the rate of live birth registration in some of the country’s densely populated provinces was high in 2022 high, despite a number of challenges hindering the process.

		India continues to inch closer to requiring fingerprint scans when companies issue SIM cards. Officials are looking at crime and terrorism trends in neighboring Pakistan in pushing for the change.

The tabled Telecommunications Bill 2023 contains draft language that would enable the central government to require telcos to gather biometrics and attach it to SIM records, <a href="https://www.thestatesman.com/business/biometric-identification-to-be-mandatory-for-sim-cards-1503251044.html">according to</a> Indian liberal-leaning publisher The Statesman.

(The law also allows the government to unilaterally seat certain telco industry executives as chair of the Telecom Regulatory Authority.)
