Capcom and NetherRealm both launched stellar new entries in their respective franchises this year, with Street Fighter 6 in particular righting the wrongs of the previous numbered entry. In January of 2024, Bandi-Namco will unleash Tekken 8 - and I've played a near-final version of the game at an event, so I wanted to share my initial thoughts. This the first new fighting game to ship on Unreal Engine 5 while also skipping last-gen consoles and the Switch - so how does it fare thus far?</p><p>During my time with Tekken 8, I had a chance to play several different modes including the story mode, the arcade quest mode and Tekken Ball - more than what's available in the publicly available demo. As feature-packed as Street Fighter 6

Sony has privately described Microsoft's $68.7bn takeover of Activision Blizzard as a potential "leapfrog" moment for its long-term console rival to take the lead.

Threats identified by Sony include Microsoft using Call of Duty to "disrupt and threaten console gaming and game subscription markets", with a potential "massive threat to PlayStation Plus".

## The Finals review - mechanically thrilling, thematically wanting

When you kill someone in The Finals, they explode in a shower of coins, their body scattering across the ground like a tub of popcorn dropped by King Midas. As with much else about the Finals, this wowed me when I first saw it. What an ingenious way to depict death in a multiplayer shooter, I thought. It's spectacular without being grisly, satisfying without being gross. Don't get me wrong, I'm a sicko for virtual gore. But this seemed like a smart, clean alternative. 
</p><p>
The longer I played the Finals, though, the more its glittering corpses troubled me. The Finals is explicitly a game about exchanging death for money, a free-to-play multiplayer shooter where you compete in teams for virtual cash prizes, and pay real money to give your tracksuit-wearing competitor a snazzier outfit. Its smash-n-grab gunfights are satisfying in the mo

Detailed plans revealing the future projects of PlayStation-owned Spider-Man developer Insomniac have been published online, stolen from the company by hackers.

The files include a project roadmap for the next decade and beyond including an array of unannounced projects, plus production details, art assets and personal information on Insomniac employees.

<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-investigating-insomniac-hack-which-reportedly-leaked-wolverine-files-and-employees-personal-data">Insomniac suffered a data breach last week</a>, with ransomware group Ryhsida demanding 50 bitcoins - the equivalent of $2m - within a week to avoid the data being published publicly. Now, seven days later, the group has gone through with its threat.
