The app is available free of charge in Windows 10 and Windows 11, but does not offer much flexibility. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Only OneDrive is generally suitable as a backup destination. Anyone who relies on cloud storage can therefore benefit from the new app. Anyone who does not use a Microsoft account or does not want to back up data to OneDrive will not benefit from this app. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Basically, Microsoft is expanding the backup and synchronization options of Windows 10/11 with the app, similar to Apple in macOS and iOS/iPadOS. Users can also use the new app to protect themselves against data loss due to ransomware. You can also use the app to keep multiple PCs and their data and settings synchronized.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p><strong>Furth", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/2172592/new-windows-11-app-windows-backup-explained-what-you-need-to-know.html", "date_published": "2023-12-19T11:30:00+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "PC world", "album": "PC world", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null, "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Get a Costco Gold Star Membership and a $40 Digital Costco Shop Card* for $60", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>This holiday season, give yourself and your family a gift that will keep on giving throughout the year.
