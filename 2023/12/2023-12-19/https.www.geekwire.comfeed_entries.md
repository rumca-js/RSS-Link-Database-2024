The statement, made via a post on the digital storefront D&#38;D Beyond, indicates that all creative contributors to D&#38;D will be required “to refrain from using AI generative tools to create final D&#38;D products.” This comes four months after an incident in August where an artist admitted he’d used AI tools to “polish” several illustrations that he’d contributed to a new D&#38;D sourcebook.

Filed in July 2021 by Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson, the lawsuit accused Google of using anticompetitive practices to insulate its app distribution service, Google Play Store, from competition. The practice forced Android app developers to raise app prices for users in order to pay Google’s exorbitant fees, according to the suit. Eligible consumers in Washington will receive at least $2, with additional payments depending on how much they spent in the Play Store between&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/google-to-pay-washington-state-play-store-users-as-part-of-700m-antitrust-settlement/">Read More</a>

The company has around 300 employees in the Seattle area, according to LinkedIn. Cruise is laying off 24% of its workforce, or about 900 employees, across the company, as it deals with the fallout of an incident in October in which a pedestrian was run over by one of its self-driving&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/self-driving-company-cruise-will-lay-off-67-workers-at-seattle-area-engineering-hub/">Read More</a>

Next year a key component of the Corporate Transparency Act comes into effect, requiring companies to report to the U.S. Treasury Department the names of their &#8220;beneficial owners.&#8221; The primary goal of the rules is to bring transparency to anonymous shell companies used to hide money laundering, finance terrorism and engage in other illegal activities.
