  <p id="wOvo8v">The idea of the world ending usually channels excess: humanity running wild because, well, what does it matter anymore? And there’s some of that in <em>Carol &amp; the End of the World</em>, a new animated series on Netflix. But mostly it’s a story about a quiet forty-something woman who uses the impending destruction of the Earth as a chance for self-reflection and discovery. While everyone else is base jumping and traveling the world, Carol slowly finds joy in the mundanity of everyday life. The show is strange yet comforting — and might just be an ideally meditative way to end the year.</p>

  <p id="9eC0nh">Meta’s Oversight Board has criticized the company’s automated moderation tools for being too aggressive after two videos that depicted hostages, injured civilians, and possible casualties in the Israel-Hamas war were — it says — unfairly removed from Facebook and Instagram.

  <p id="At0GGX">Netflix’s next sci-fi movie has a surprising lead. The streamer just released the first (very brief) teaser for <em>Spaceman</em>, which stars Adam Sandler as an astronaut who encounters a mysterious alien creature (voiced by Paul Dano) while on a research mission in space. The film, directed by Johan Renck, sounds weird and grim and is based on the Czech novel <em>Spaceman of Bohemia</em> by Jaroslav Kalfař.</p>
<p id="PFWB9c">Here’s how Netflix describes the premise:</p>

<p id="pFNnYh">As 2023 draws to a close, it’s time to look back on the year that was. It was a great year for entertainment and a not-so-great year for the people who actually made that entertainment. It was the year Twitter died, and the year Matter mostly failed to launch. Gadgets got gadgety-er, photos got what-is-a-photo-ier, and generative AI was suddenly everywhere. </p>
