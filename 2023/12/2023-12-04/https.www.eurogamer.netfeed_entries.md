BioWare just released a new Dragon Age: Dreadwolf teaser, only to then say the game won't be getting a full reveal until next year.
</p><p>
The short teaser comes in at just shy of 50 seconds, and pans across some nice vistas - the port city in Antiva sits bathed in evening light, the Rivain shoreline is lapped by azure blue seas, Anderfels is in the midst of a storm. It is all very Dragon Age-y, much as you would expect.
</p><p>
"Enter Thedas, a vibrant land of rugged wilderness, treacherous labyrinths, and glittering cities - steeped in savage combat and secret magics. Now, its fate teeters on a knife's edge," the teaser's description reads.

</p><p>
Codenamed Project Baxter, the upcoming game is expected to release across platforms in 2026. It is being produced in Unreal Engine 5.
</p><p>
While further details on this project are still thin, the studio has said players can expect "the signature Starbreeze game cornerstones of co-operative multiplayer, lifetime commitment through a Games as a Service-model, community engagement and a larger than life experience" on release. When Project Baxter launches, Starbreeze will also act as the game's publisher.

## DF Weekly: Arkham Knight on Switch is disastrously poor

This week's DF Direct Weekly kicks off with our 'hot take' on the state of Batman: Arkham Trilogy on Nintendo Switch. We film the show on Friday morning and so only had an hour or so with the game before we sat down to record, but we had to know the answer to one burning question: can Nintendo's handheld hybrid really run Batman: Arkham Knight? Hopes were high for another 'impossible port' but alas, the final game is practically a disaster, brutally cutback in every conceivable way and plagued with profound stuttering problems.
</p><p>
Lighting is savagely downgraded, texture quality is a total mess, shadows take a trip back to PS2 era standards and geometry is culled. Arkham Knight routinely fails to hit its 30 frames per second target, often lingering in the low to mid-20s but worse than that is the pervasive stuttering problem. Mos

It seems that someone heard my calls, as I've got the <a href="https://wombatkeyboards.com/products/pine-professional">Wombat Pine Professional</a> sat on my desk to review. It may not be from a brand many of you know, but the parent company of Wombat, KSI (not that one) first made peripherals to pair with Apple's IIe four decades ago. Now they've released a full-size wireless mechanical keyboard that, on paper, looks like a solid option for Mac users looking to upgrade their typing experience without giving up the benefits of Mac-specific designs.</p><p>The Pine Pro, in its grey and black colourway here, looks classy and purposeful.

## The PlayStation Access Controller Review - software's the star, but you'll probably still need a DualSense

The PlayStation Access Controller is a bold statement by PlayStation that the platform holder understands the importance of hardware accessibility. Players previously excluded from enjoying PlayStation games due to the lack of hardware choice now have the freedom to expand their gaming horizons.
</p><p>
It's important to note upfront that, while the Access Controller may have similarities to the Xbox Adaptive Controller, it's designed to be a full controller solution without needing external input devices. It's supported by robust accessibility software, rather than acting as a switch hub, like the XAC. There are positives and negatives to this.
</p><p>
The controller itself is aesthetically pleasing, matching the white and black colour scheme of the PS5 and DualSense controller. The rubber grips on the base are a
