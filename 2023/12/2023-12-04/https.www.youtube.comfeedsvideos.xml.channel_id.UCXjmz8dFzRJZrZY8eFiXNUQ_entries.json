Though after it's first couple seasons, the show was almost cancelled completely.  After the writers strike ended, How I Met Your Mother needed a big swing to keep audiences tuned in.  Luckily, Britney Spears reached out wanting to be on the show, and How I Me Your Mother creators Carter Bays and Craig Thomas leaped at the opportunity.  Without Britney Spears joining the cast, the show may have never seen a Season 4. \n\n#howimetyourmother #britneyspears #tedmosby #nerdstalgic \n\nSOURCES:\nhttps://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/how-i-met-your-mother-was-saved-by-britney-spears.html/ \nhttps://www.eonline.com/ca/news/506879/jennifer-love-hewitt-turned-down-how-i-met-your-mother-plus-series-finale-secrets-reveale \nhttps://www.cbr.com/tv-legends-revealed-the-many-mothers-of-how-i-met-your-mother/ \nhttps://screenrant.com/how-met-mother-britney-spears-cameo-explained/ \nh", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn6T8i3v5I8", "date_published": "2023-12-04T18:00:13+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "Nerdstalgic", "album": "Nerdstalgic", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/Rn6T8i3v5I8/hqdefault.jpg", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}]
