According to a forecast by the U.N., if China's fertility rate fails to increase and its total population continues to decline, the country's population, officially claimed to be 1.4 billion, may be left with fewer than 800 million people by the end of the twenty-first century. China's declining population, accompanied by an aging trend, will not only result in shrinking its consumption power and diminishing its status as the world's factory but will also increase financial pressure on pension and healthcare expenditures. The impact on China's and even the world's economy will be far-reaching. 

However, as mentioned earlier, even the most authoritative experts in China dare not really come up with practical and effective suggestions for the CCP. In such a case, one can actually see the future of the red country under the CCP's rule today.
