<p>After years of rumor and speculation, the first trailer for Rockstar Games' Grand Theft Auto VI has debuted. The trailer initially leaked less than a day before its planned debut, which prompted Rockstar to release it early. As rumored, GTA VI is set in Vice City and is scheduled to launch in 2025.</p><p>Rockstar Games previously confirmed it was developing the next GTA game, but this is the first time we're getting any level of detail on what to expect. Based on the trailer, it appears the rumors were also correct that GTA VI will feature two protagonists--a man and a woman. The female character appears to be an ex-con, and we see what looks like some form of in-game social media, as we see a lot of what looks like TikTok videos or Instagram Reels. There's a Florida Man joke, too, and we see the Florida wetlands in addition to Rockstar's take on Miami.</p><figure><div class="image-gallery__label">Gallery</div>   <div class="image-gallery__list hide-scrollbar image-gallery__list--

<p dir="ltr">The world of adaptive controllers can often feel expensive and overly complicated for a disabled player. Paying $100-plus for a base controller and then an extra $80-plus for extensions that you aren't sure will work for you feels intimidating and, at the end of the day, like a significant investment for something that may not provide the ideal experience. However, adaptive, ergonomically designed, and affordable equipment is a hole in the market that Sony is now attempting to fill with the Access controller. After using it for a week in my own setup and with a variety of games, it is a significant first step towards an accessible controller for the PS5 and something that the industry can learn from.</p><p dir="ltr">What sets the Access controller apart is the ability to easily customize it right out of the box. Where many other adaptive controllers require you to purchase outside equipment, this one has a base setup of 8 pillow cap plates, a touchpad in the middle, and

<p>All eyes are on Rockstar Games this week as the studio prepares to celebrate its 25th anniversary with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6s-first-trailer-coming-december-5-miami-setting-teased/1100-6519615/">first official look at Grand Theft Auto 6</a>. Fans have been waiting years for Rockstar to lift the lid on the next GTA chapter, but as some eagle-eyed players have noticed, the developer might have teased the trailer reveal date months ago.</p><p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/grand-theft-auto-v/gta-5-update-message">PCGamesN</a> earlier this year, GTA Online added a new T-shirt at the time that read "OneDayWillRevealAll" and also included a number sequence of 12523. Putting two and two together--or separating by two digits--that sequence could be interpreted as December 5, 2023. Several people on Twitter made note of this at the time, and just a few days ago, Rockstar announced that the Grand Theft Auto 6 trailer will debut on December 5 at

<p>Season 1 of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii/">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</a> arrives on December 6, bringing with it the game's integration with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone/">Warzone</a> and the Urzikstan Map. A new Call of Duty trailer shows some of the action players can expect on the upcoming map. The full trailer can be viewed below.</p><p>Urzikstan replaces Al Mazrah as Warzone's new standard map for Season 1, and the trailer shows a close look at some of the new POIs, which includes a few urban city locations. The map features 11 named points of interest and a brand-new Gulag.</p><p>Players who own Modern Warfare 3 will likely already be familiar with the new map, as Urzikstan is currently available to play in Zombies mode. However, one feature exclusive to the battle royale-version of the map is the new drivable train.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-warzone-trailer-shows

But there's something different about the PS4 continuing to thrive. Compared to where the PS1, 2, or 3 were at the decade-old mark, the PS4 doesn't feel like it's in its twilight, instead happily co-existing as a still-viable option right alongside its newer, flashier brother. That certainly made sense in those dark pandemic days when the PS4 was more readily available, but even some three years after the PS5's launch, there are still a few key ways in which the PS4 can lord over the PS5.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Custom Themes</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4229812-themes.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Yes, Sony, it's very nice that every game creates its own little

<p>Amazon's superhero/antihero TV show The Boys is coming back for its fourth season next year, and the first trailer for it has now arrived. The video and this story contain spoilers for The Boys.</p><p>It's a tense time in the world of The Boys, and the stakes are "higher than ever," Amazon said in the official plot description for Season 4. Homelander continues to exert his power and control while Butcher is even further relegated. The fate of the world hinges upon whether or not The Boys can come together.</p><p>The trailer also features Jeffrey Dean Morgan's character making fun of the name "The Boys," which is pretty great. The trailer ends with a striking scene involving Homelander (Antony Starr) standing in an elevator with blood all over his face.
