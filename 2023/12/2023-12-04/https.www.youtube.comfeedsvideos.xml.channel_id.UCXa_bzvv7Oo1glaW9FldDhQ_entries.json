The same applies to action RPGs, which utilize upgrades, level-ups and loot while embracing faster-paced combat.\n\nWhether it's a hack-and-slash title with epic boss storylines and boss fights, games that emphasize difficulty and exploration, or shooters which offer choice and build variety, there are all kinds of action RPGs out there. Given the genre's history, how many are worth playing, let alone investing dozens of hours and repeat playthroughs?\n\nCheck out our list of top 30 action RPGs as of 2023.
