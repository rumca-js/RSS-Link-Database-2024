		Image quality assessment algorithms are getting better at detection specific defects that will impact face biometrics match success, according to a new report from the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology.

NIST’s Face Analysis Technology Evaluation (FATE) Part 11 report evaluates algorithms for Face Image Quality Vector Assessment, in terms of their performance for Quality Specific Image Defect Detection (SIDD).

The <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/frvt/reports/quality_sidd/frvt_quality_sidd_report.pdf">latest evaluation</a> adds a pair of submissions from <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/secunet">secunet</a>, as well as modified measures for subjects with open eyes and mouths, and occluded faces.

		Rapid changes in biometric technology are a challenge to regulators, while legislative approaches to applications such as keystroke and eye tracking are increasingly out of date, according to Australia’s new national privacy commissioner, Carly Kind.

Kind, a human rights lawyer and founder of UK privacy organization the <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/ada-lovelace-institute">Ada Lovelace Institute</a>, was <a href="https://ministers.ag.gov.au/media-centre/freedom-information-commissioner-and-privacy-commissioner-appointments-27-11-2023">named</a> the country’s new Privacy Commissioner last week.

		A rare Biometric Information Privacy Act win for the defense has been recorded in the U.S. state of Illinois.

Health care workers in some instances are not protected by BIPA, an Illinois law that requires private organizations to get written consent from people before collecting biometric data and inform them of how it will be managed.

The Illinois Supreme Court <a href="https://www.law360.com/articles/1771584/attachments/0">unanimously found</a> that no consent is required when a health care worker is required by an employer to submit to a fingerprint scan to access drug cabinets.

Sweden-based Assa Abloy and a group of others did not impress the Patent Trial and Appeal Board when arguing that the patents in question, owned by <a href="https://cpctm.com/">CPC</a> Patent Technologies, were obvious developments based on previous certifications.

(Australia firm CPC is commonly <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/02/24/australian-patent-troll/">regarded</a> as a patent troll, but <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/assa-abloy">Assa Abloy</a> can throw an elbow in patent matters, too.)

From letting hotels keep copies of our passports to handing over IDs for car hire or air travel, we seldom think twice about the implications of physically sharing our identity documents. By now, we’ve gotten accustomed to exchanging personal information in return for a product or service we value – but we need to be more vigilant at a time when <a href="https://onfido.com/landing/identity-fraud-report/">identity fraud is jumping as much as 37 percent</a>.

		Australia has released a tender to upgrade 11 of its major airports with biometric cameras that can capture and compare live facial images of travelers.

The new equipment will include facial recognition cameras, software, a user interface, installation and maintenance, <a href="https://www.tenders.gov.au/Atm/Show/442fe346-4d0d-4b2d-8a96-65a2fcd2ffc9">according</a> to the request for tender published last week.

The cameras will be used by Australian Border Force (ABF) officers in primary lines where travelers are cleared to enter or exit Australia. The technology is supposed to replace the current manual face-to-passport check with live facial capture and automated passport comparisons.

The cameras are expected to be rolled out by July 2026 at major Australian airport
