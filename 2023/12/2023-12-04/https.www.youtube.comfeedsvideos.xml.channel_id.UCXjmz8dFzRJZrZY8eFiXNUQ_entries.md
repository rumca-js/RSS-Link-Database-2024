In today's sitcom landscape, How I Met Your Mother is often seen as one of the most successful shows from the mid 2000's.  Though after it's first couple seasons, the show was almost cancelled completely.  After the writers strike ended, How I Met Your Mother needed a big swing to keep audiences tuned in.  Luckily, Britney Spears reached out wanting to be on the show, and How I Me Your Mother creators Carter Bays and Craig Thomas leaped at the opportunity.  Without Britney Spears joining the cast, the show may have never seen a Season 4.
