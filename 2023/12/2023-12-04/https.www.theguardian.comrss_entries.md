<p>Deniz Undav and Serhou Guirassy have helped establish a new normal in routine victories despite departing talent in summer</p><p>They looked resplendent as they walked out in their black and white-marbled tops, with the club badge in gold just above the heart. This weekend, Stuttgart were ready to walk tall.</p><p>The kit itself, designed by a renowned local artist Tim Bengel, was priced in the shop at €189.30 with only 1893 limited-edition pieces available (it being “an art object and collector’s item” is the reason for the price hike, the club’s press release said), both a nod to the year of the club’s foundation and a push to raise money for social projects in the region. The white swirl? It represented the head of Filderkraut, the Baden-Württemberg region’s white cabbage superfood, which is a recurrent theme in Bengel’s work. VfB representing the region with pride, and looking chic, is a departure from recent years.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/d

<p>Triggered by Nigel Farage’s involvement, the reality TV juggernaut is facing crisis after crisis – even Ant and Dec have turned against their baby. Is this the end?</p><p>The big draw of this year’s I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here! was supposed to be Nigel Farage. His appearance was meant to galvanise the entire show, in the way that previous appearances from politicians had. He would turn up, all the campmates would yell at him, he’d be forced to do an endless succession of grisly bushtucker trials, he would earn a thin patina of respect for his endurance and then he would end up coming fourth.</p><p>But that hasn’t really happened. Farage was paid £1.5m to appear on I’m a Celebrity, and so far he only appears to have repelled viewers. Just 7m people watched the first episode this year, compared with more than 9m in 2022. Even accounting for the speed at which viewers are deserting terrestrial broadcasters, that’s a hell of a drop. In fact, it might even signal the end of th

<p>A delicious way to poach a chicken, bollito-style, with a range of flavours to complement it</p><p><strong><br /></strong>Before she moved, Ginia lived in a fifth-floor flat in a 1920s block near Piazza Vittorio. And before she gave up cooking, she used to make a <em>bollito</em> every other Sunday. Once upon a time, that meant an almost full <em>bollito misto alla Piemontese</em>, as her father taught her to make it: beef (muscle, tail and tongue), also a whole chicken and <a href="https://www.lacucinaitaliana.com/italian-food/how-to-cook/cotechino-classic-lentils?refresh_ce=">cotechino</a> sausage boiled separately, then served together, sliced and steaming hot, with a selection of sauces. But as the years went on and the house emptied – of children, also of her husband (she threw him out) – her bollito streamlined.</p><p>By the time I met Ginia, the bollito was half a chicken, or maybe a boneless beef rib known as <em>scaramella</em>. Not that there was any talk of food when we

<p>Talking toys have an adventure in Central Park in this subpar children’s film that fails to offer much in the way of imagination</p><p>‘From the writers of Toy Story,” it says on the poster for this kids’ animation, and the plot is similarly based on the idea of toys coming to life – this time, old-fashioned marionettes in a puppet theatre. But proceed with caution because The Inseparables is not a Pixar movie and, aside from two of the writers, this boring, unfunny and somewhat soulless film shares no perceivable DNA with Toy Story.</p><p>The setting is Central Park in New York, where the puppets in a children’s theatre have been running the show since their elderly puppet-maker retired. (No mention of how they keep the front of house going or pay the bills.) But not all the actors are happy: balding clown Don is sick of being typecast as the fool (“You’re the funny guy! The nincompoop!”) and dreams of playing a knight on a quest. Like his namesake Don Quixote, he turns the world

Not only was I in denial about a suspected animal allergy, but I was sharing a tiny rented flat in Dubai that barely had enough space for our handbags, let alone a pet. When I saw a local cat charity begging for someone to foster a three-legged kitten on Christmas Eve, however, I couldn’t resist. With so many volunteers away for the holidays, he urgently needed a place to stay. Tarmac, as they’d named him, had been found in a car park missing one of his front paws. The vets had no idea how he’d lost it, but said he’d need an operation to remove the remainder of his leg as he grew older.</p><p>The charity advertised the kitten for adoption, and in the meantime he came home with me. As a tiny, rescued kitten who had experienced trauma, he could have been shy and frightened

<p>Scientist proposes framework for reconciling mathematically incompatible theories of quantum mechanics and Einstein’s gravity</p><p>At the heart of modern physics is a gulf that scientists have spent more than a century trying to bridge. Quantum mechanics gives an apparently flawless description of the forces that dominate at the atomic scale. Albert Einstein’s theory of general relativity has never been proven wrong in its predictions of how gravity shapes cosmic events. But the two theories are fundamentally incompatible.</p><p>Now, scientists have proposed a framework that they say could unify these two pillars of physics, through a radical rethink of the nature of spacetime. Instead of time ticking away predictably, under the “postquantum theory of classical gravity”, the rate at which time flows would wobble randomly, like the ebb and flow of a stream.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/dec/04/wobbly-spacetime-may-resolve-contradictory-physics-theories">Con

I offered up my iPod to the friend-of-a-friend who had a portable speaker and was controlling the music.

<p>Oleksandr Zinchenko struggles to strike right balance, Vincent Kompany gets a break and Chelsea still too naive</p><p>Oleksandr Zinchenko’s mixed bag of a performance showed the full-back’s qualities in attack but once more highlighted his defensive deficiencies. While Zinchenko was instrumental in the brilliant team goal scored by Martin Ødegaard that gave Arsenal a 2-0 lead over Wolves, a series of errors culminated with him giving the ball away cheaply to allow Matheus Cunha’s late strike that threatened what could have been a comfortable victory for the league leaders. While Mikel Arteta brushed aside concerns about the 26-year-old, he did admit that “in those areas it’s a big no to play, especially after certain things in the previous phase”. With Kieran Tierney reportedly to be sold in January, Zinchenko appears to be vying with the versatile Takehiro Tomiyasu to start at left-back. Arsenal fans will hope his mistakes do not end up costing them dear. <strong>Ed Aarons</stron

<p>The frenzied debate about ‘record levels’ of net migration ignores the true cause of it all</p><p>The headline, now increasing in pitch, capital letters and exclamation marks, is that net migration is off the charts. <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12783349/Net-migration-high-huge-pressure-Rishi-Sunak.html">It is soaring</a>. It is <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/e1cabc36-d050-4674-a16c-fff60c548174">at an all-time high</a>.

<p><strong>Leeds Playhouse</strong><br />James Brining’s exemplary staging solves every problem – the antisemitism, the coercive romance – that Oliver Bart’s joyous, beloved but difficult musical presents</p><p>With child hunger and antisemitism each making a comeback in Britain, a revival of Lionel Bart’s Oliver! has – amid its tunes, glorious tunes – an unwanted topicality. And though Bart’s 1960 musical twist on Dickens is one to which audiences will always warm, it is notably hard to cast and stage. There is a child central character, meaning that, unusually, the protagonist has only one solo: Where Is Love? And equally unusually for the genre, it has a love story that is violent and coercive: Nancy and Bill Sikes.</p><p>After a first hour with no romantic ballads, Bart cleverly contrives one with Nancy, the Dodger and Oliver imagining the love lives of aristocrats in the musically beautiful but dramatically curious I’d Do Anything. Then there’s the Fagin problem. Dickens wrote a
