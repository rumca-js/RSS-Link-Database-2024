<p>Rockstar has released the trailer of <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em>, the next game in the blockbuster video game franchise a day earlier than expected. You can watch it here:</p>
<div id="4186f03ce9e9478fb25ae100f07c4a39"></div>
<p>It's been a decade since Rockstar Games released <em>Grand Theft Auto V</em>. While fans have been more than able to keep themselves busy with <em>GTA Online</em> and a few re-releases, they've been waiting patiently (or impatiently) for more single-player action. The wait's now much shorter as Rockstar has revealed the first official look at the game's debut trailer.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As indicated by a <a href="https://twitter.com/RockstarGames/status/1730587560726892883">recent teaser image</a> and various rumors, <em>GTA VI</em> will be set in Leonida, Rockstar's take on Florida, and largely centered on Vice City, the series' stand in for Miami. Given the weapons and other tech on display, it seems to be a contemporary game, 

## Audio giant Rode acquires rival Mackie to expand its focus on creators

<p>Audio device leader Rode just acquired rival company Mackie, creating something of a pro audio and streaming powerhouse. Rode used to exclusively deal with pro-level audio devices, like condenser microphones, but has since turned its eye to the growing streaming market. To that end, products like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rodes-psa-1-podcasting-boom-arm-230009046.html">Rode’s PSA1+ boom arm</a> have become fixtures with popular live streamers.</p>
<p>Mackie has taken a similar route. The company made a name for itself during the home recording boom of the 1990s and early 2000s by offering affordable, yet highly functional, mixers, PA systems and related devices. Nowadays, the company has leaned into the streamer/creator space with consumer-grade streaming mixers and monitor controllers, though it still manufactures pro audio gear.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It’s no secret that the streaming space is more lucrative than pro audio. It’s just simple math, as

<p>WhatsApp is currently <a href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-for-ios-23-24-73-whats-new/"><ins>rolling out a new update for iOS users</ins></a> that allows people to share photos and videos over the messaging platform in their original quality, with no compression. The platform has been notorious for low-quality media transfers, even after an August update that brought a bit of high-def goodness to its compression algorithm, so this is a welcome change.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What’s the secret sauce here? As previously indicated, these media files aren’t compressed at all. Instead, the update treats media as standard data files. When you send one of these files, they aren’t transformed into previews for the chat window, but the recipient can click to view. You’ll still be able to send media the old-fashioned way, if losing the chat window preview thumbnails is a bridge too far.</p>

The cuts are being made due to what Ek called &quot;the challenges ahead&quot; and he elected to make them immediately instead of doing smaller reductions over time. Affected employees will be notified later today, he added.&nbsp;</p>
