But in 2023? They've taken a backseat to several essential games from other genres that debuted this year. That's not to say that shooters are declining, as there were many games this year where the emphasis was on filling your hand with iron and slinging some lead at any enemies on the screen.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">According to GameSpot's sister site, Metacritic, 2023 saw explosive spellcasting, remasters of classic FPS games, and intense virtual reality experiences rise to the top, all bringing with them a unique sense of action and style. We've crunched the numbers for the best shooters of 2023 according to various outlets on Metacritic, and you can read below to see which games in that action-packed genre made the cut this ye", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-best-shooter-games-of-2023-according-to-metacritic/2900-5001", "date_published": "2023-12-16T19:00:00+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "GameSpot", "album": "GameSpot", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null, "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Best Of 2023: Our Favorite Games That Didn't Make The Top 10", "description": "<p><h2>There are plenty of other games released in 2023 that we loved, too.</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1179/11799911/4235492-personal-faves_gs-best-of_2023_1.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Narrowing a list of all the games from a given year into a list of what we feel are the 10 best is never an easy task. The list is meant to distill the overall GameSpot team's thoughts on the very best games, which invariably means we all end up with games not making the cut that we were individually passionate about. That might be because not enough people played a certain game or because something just really connected with a particular person.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">But that doesn't mean these games aren't worth highlighting, and with that in mind, we asked the GameSpot staff to talk about the game that they most loved from this year that didn't make our list of the <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/gamespots-10-best-games-of-2023/2900-4972/\">10 best games of 20", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-of-2023-our-favorite-games-that-didnt-make-the-top-10/2900-4993", "date_published": "2023-12-16T18:00:00+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "GameSpot", "album": "GameSpot", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null, "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Firearms Expert Reacts to The Finals\u2019 Guns", "description": "<img height=\"480\" src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_medium/1571/15719603/4235802-the_finals_site.jpg\" width=\"480\" /> Jonathan Ferguson, a weapons expert and Keeper of Firearms &amp; Artillery at the Royal Armouries, breaks down the guns of The Finals, including the AKM, the Model 1887, and a particularly interesting variant of the Lewis Gun sporting a Roulette wheel in place of the iconic magazine.", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/videos/firearms-expert-reacts-to-the-finals-guns/2300-6463103", "date_published": "2023-12-16T15:00:00+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "GameSpot", "album": "GameSpot", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null, "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "The Best Action Games Of 2023 According To Metacritic", "description": "<p><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4235506-best-reviewed-action-games_gs-best-of_2023_1.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Video games are the ultimate power fantasy, as they regularly provide a brief escape into other worlds where the rules of reality don't apply. Action games starring chivalrous knights fighting the good fight, comic book adaptations set in the heart of the Big Apple, and horror-fueled efforts to survive unspeakable monstrosities are far more appealing than being stuck behind your desk at your 9-5, and 2023 has seen dozens of terrific action games released.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">So which games were the best when it came to delivering exciting adventures in fantasy realms, real-world adjacent cities, and dark futures?
