If you’ve ever thought about building your own laptop, luggable, or briefcase PC, you probably came to the conclusion pretty quickly that building a portable chassis from scratch is just not something an average person should have to do. But now, thanks to Alibaba’s constant stream of weird oddity computer parts, we can fit a full gaming PC, complete with a desktop GPU, 600W power supply, and ITX motherboard, in a case that’s only slightly larger than a laptop that’s too big to be useful, and only slightly heavier than what would cause an average person to slip a disc.
