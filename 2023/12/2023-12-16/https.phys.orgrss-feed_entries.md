In southern China, the genetically improved slash pine (Pinus elliottii) plays a crucial role in timber and resin production, with new shoot density being a key growth trait. Current manual counting methods are inefficient and inaccurate. Emerging technologies such as UAV-based RGB imaging and deep learning (DL) offer promising solutions.

Algeria's Tassili N'Ajjer plateau is Africa's largest national park. Among its vast sandstone formations is perhaps the world's largest art museum. Over 15,000 etchings and paintings are exhibited there, some as much as 11,000 years old according to scientific dating techniques, representing a unique ethnological and climatological record of the region.

That gender discrimination is wrong is beyond argument. But identifying which incidents are cases of it is not always so clear cut. That's why researchers are recommending that organizations develop processes that encourage workers to share their concerns when they suspect but aren't sure that they have experienced discriminatory treatment based on their gender.
