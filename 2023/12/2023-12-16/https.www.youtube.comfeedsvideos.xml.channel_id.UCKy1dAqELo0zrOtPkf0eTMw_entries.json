We take a look at the Tom Petty\u2019s Love Is A Long Road song used in the GTA 6 trailer, to see what it might tell us about the relationship between Lucia and Jason. There\u2019s also been discussions of #RockstarGames possibly restricting map movement for Lucia, indicative by the ankle monitor she\u2019s pictured wearing in the GTA 6 poster.
