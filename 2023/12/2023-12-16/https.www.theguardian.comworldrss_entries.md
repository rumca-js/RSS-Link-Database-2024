<p>The ex-Coronation actor grew and grew over the series and her partner went one better than his semi-final placing last year</p><p>It was a night of high-quality hoofing, high scores and high camp but ultimately, the Strictly Come Dancing final went the way that bookmakers predicted. Odds-on favourite Ellie Leach and her professional partner, Vito Coppola, were crowned champions. As they lifted the glitterball trophy and sparkly confetti fell, it made a fitting climax to another feelgood series.</p><p>Former Coronation Street actor Leach, 22, had blossomed before viewers’ eyes. Initially an unfancied contender, she visibly grew in confidence to become a pocket rocket performer. Combining strong technique with storytelling skills, this likable all-rounder was equally accomplished at ballroom or Latin. The West End stage surely awaits this infectiously joyous dancer.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/dec/16/ellie-leach-and-vito-coppola-crowned-king-and-queen-
