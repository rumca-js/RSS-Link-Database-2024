## GTA 6: The Trailer Is Hiding Something | GTFM

The GTA 6 trailer fan theories have been running wild. While we've poured over the GTA 6 map details, we also think that these #GTA6 Story theories are making a lot of sense. Was the Grand Theft Auto 6 trailer hiding something more than we realized? Does something as simple as a well placed watch mean that Jason is potentially an undercover Vice City police officer? Rockstar is no stranger to using music tracks that allude to something. We take a look at the Tom Pettyâ€™s Love Is A Long Road song used in the GTA 6 trailer, to see what it might tell us about the relationship between Lucia and Jason. Thereâ€™s also been discussions of #RockstarGames possibly restricting map movement for Lucia, indicative by the ankle monitor sheâ€™s pictured wearing in the GTA 6 poster. Let's dive into what everyone thinks is happening.

Donâ€™t worry, weâ€™re here to show you every resource youâ€™ll need, broken down category by category, in LEGO Fortnite.

In today's Daily Fix:
Baldur's Gate 3 won the coveted Best Game of the Year award at this year's Game Awards, and if you were hoping it would land on a game subscription service like Xbox Game Pass, well you'll be waiting for a long time. Developer Larian Studios has confirmed that have no plans to bring the game to Game Pass. Sorry folks. In other news, Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree's release window may have been leaked by a third-party controller maker. Whoops. And finally, Valve is handing out presents this holiday season, but not the kind you'd want. Players on their naughty list and getting a lump of digital coal and a permanent ban from Dota 2.

## Gary Oldman Says Harry Potter and The Dark Knight Saved Him - IGN The Fix: Entertainment

In today's Fix of entertainment news:

Actor Gary Oldman admits that the blockbuster Harry Potter and The Dark Knight franchises saved him. After being divorced and wanting to be closer to his kids, Oldman took the two roles because of how they benefited his schedule. And it was the right move, as both franchises have been engrained in pop culture and Oldman himself has become something of an icon in both fanbases. In other news, A24 has announced a partnership with Hideo Kojima to adapt his game, Death Stranding, into a movie. No other details were announced, but seeing as how some Kojima games are mostly cutscenes anyway, this makes sense. And finally, Zack Snyder has revealed a bit of dream casting he'd want for a future Rebel Moon movie.

## Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader Review

Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader reviewed by Leana Hafer on PC.

Even in such a banner year for RPGs, Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader stands out as one you wouldn't want to miss. Excellent writing, great combat, and the chance to get up close and personal with some of the most interesting and exciting elements of the 40K universe makes for a stimulating gore-feast of a journey. Its systems are a complicated beast to master and the bugs are numerous and significant, but it speaks to the quality of everything surrounding them that they didn't sour the experience more than they did. Owlcat has taken a proud step forward as an RPG developer to keep an augmentic eye on. Count this one among the Imperium's finest.
