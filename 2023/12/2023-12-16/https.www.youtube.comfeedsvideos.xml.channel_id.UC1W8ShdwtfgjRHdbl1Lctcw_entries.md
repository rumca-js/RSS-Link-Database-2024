I colorized, restored and created sound design for this video of 1920s New York, exploring the vibrant streets of New York. The jazz-filled air, iconic skyscrapers and infectious energy of an era that defined the spirit of the city that never sleeps.

Video Restoration Process:
âœ” FPS boosted to 60 frames per second 
âœ” Image resolution boosted up to HD 
âœ” Improved video sharpness and brightness 
âœ” Colorized only for the ambiance (not historically accurate)
âœ”added sound only for the ambiance
âœ”restoration:(stabilisation,denoise,cleand,deblur) 

Please, be aware that colorization colors are not real and fake, colorization was made only for the ambiance and do not represent real historical data.

Thanks to EYE film museum to share the black & white video source
