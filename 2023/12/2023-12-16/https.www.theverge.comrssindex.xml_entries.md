  <p id="b0x5kt">Apple <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=6e9odqgu">announced a pilot program</a> called “contingent pricing for subscriptions” yesterday that will let App Store developers automatically offer discounted subscriptions for users of other apps. Developers, the company says, will be able to base this on subscriptions “from one developer or two different developers,” which lets them not only to entice customers they already have to their other apps, but also compete by offering deals to their competitors’ subscribers.</p>

  <p id="gwwRAl">Apple rules the iPhone’s App Store with an iron fist — sideloading outside it is not allowed. Google lets anyone install any app on an Android phone. But guess which one of these two companies has an illegal monopoly, according to the courts?</p>

Pretty soon after a very online family member looks up in confusion and asks either what the show is or why they keep hearing about it when no one they know seems to watch it. </p>

  <p id="FAIY2j">Though there are a handful of human survivors at the core of its story, the real star of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23912922/scavengers-reign-review-max"><em>Scavengers Reign</em></a> isn’t a person; it’s a planet. The animated series features a group of astronauts stranded on a bizarre alien world and follows them as they contend with the harsh, confusing, and downright odd environment around them. There are flying creatures that can double as gas masks and giant monkey-frogs that use psychic powers to lure in victims. Things only get weirder from there.
