<p>This wonderful series documents the passion and idealism of the 70s music scene. It’s an immaculately soundtracked history lesson – and so much more besides</p><p>After the tumult of the last few years, UK nightlife is in a perilous position, battered by rising costs for venues, a lack of staff, cash-strapped clubbers and changing habits ushered in by the pandemic. But if anything can get people in the mood to go out and dance again, it’s Disco: Soundtrack of a Revolution. This three-part documentary, a co-production with PBS, is the sort of top-quality music doc the BBC just casually and quietly releases, as if it does this sort of thing all the time. But this one really is a feast. It’s a history lesson with an immaculate soundtrack and it is about so much more than disco.</p><p>The first episode covers the boom in gay clubs in New York City during the early 1970s, and the arrival of a new sound, and wraps it all up in a thrilling social history. It begins not with sequins and g

<p>Three of Manchester United’s 25 managers have won the title and it will be remarkable if the Dutchman makes that four</p><p>Already, it feels, we have reached the stage of the cycle at which Erik ten Hag is being discussed in historical terms. The precise details have ceased to matter – where did Raphaël Varane disappear to in the autumn? What’s Bruno Fernandes really upset about? How can André Onana, a goalkeeper who specialises in pushing up behind a high line, so often be caught too deep? Does anybody remember Jadon Sancho? – and Manchester United’s manager has become just another chapter in the increasingly lengthy post‑Ferguson malaise.</p><p>Ten Hag is the 25th manager in United’s history. He looks almost certain to be the 22nd to have failed to win the league. Perhaps Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s purchase of a quarter of the club, assuming it is eventually completed, will spark a remarkable turnaround and Ten Hag can join Ernest Mangnall, Sir Alex Ferguson and Sir Matt Busby as a le

If Britain is to fix its growth problem, we must deal with the fact that more working-age people must get well – soon<p>Economic growth is often described in the dry language of statistics: GDP figures, productivity rates and trade balances. But these numbers collectively represent not just the wealth of a nation; they profoundly affect how life feels for all but the most affluent, filtering through into wage growth and thus living standards, affecting tax revenues and so the character of public services and the generosity of the welfare safety net. So the UK’s <a href="https://economy2030.resolutionfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Ending-stagnation-final-report.pdf" title="">laggard economic performance</a> in the 15 years since the financial crisis, underpinned by poor productivity growth, matters very much.

Early responses to the Prince Harry verdict suggest that lessons have not been learned<p>How a crisis in the British press is reported is often the best way of judging how the industry hopes to deal with it. And Saturday’s coverage of Prince Harry’s £140,600 in damages after winning his phone hacking case suggests business as usual. This is not only disappointing for all of us who believe in the power of British journalism, but disastrous for the industry itself.</p><p>All but one national newspaper either left the story off its front page altogether, or offered the view that, while Harry might have scored a partial victory against Mirror Group Newspapers, he was still a liar, according to Piers Morgan, the former editor criticised in the judgment.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/dec/16/press-faces-peril-cant-just-shrug-move-on-prince-harry">Continue reading...</a>

Sales of champagne are down in favour of  whisper it, lambrusco, but bubbly will be back when there’s something to celebrate<p>Winston Churchill once said he couldn’t live without champagne: “In victory, I deserve it. In defeat, I need it.” He even named one of his horses Pol Roger, a famous champagne brand.

Before getting too excited about the CofE’s ‘prayers of love and faith’ it’s worth reading the ecclesiastical small print<p>Today, for the first Sunday in the 489-year history of the Church of England, its vicars are at liberty to offer “prayers of love and faith” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/15/same-sex-couples-blessings-church-of-england" title="">to same-sex couples</a>. Before you greet this news with a long-overdue hallelujah, it is worth studying the ecclesiastical small print. The blessings are to be understood in the context of what the church now calls “covenanted friendships”, explained as follows: “Covenanted friendships are relationships of an entirely different nature to marriage. The friends may be married to other people, or unmarried. The friendship is by definition not sexually intimate …”</p><p>Several bishops, even so, feel uneasy at the implied break with the organisation’s more traditional homophobia.

<p>Football is defined by a series of moments. An inch here and there, a tackle that is a second too late, a ball that flies agonisingly wide of its target. As the 58th minute struck at a tense Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, Tottenham took their moment superbly, a goal from Martha Thomas sending the home crowd wild. It earned a 1-0 victory, their first in a north London derby, that put a dent in Arsenal’s title aspirations.</p><p>The buzz was palpable as more than 20,000 spectators filed in for Spurs’ first game in their main stadium this season. Robert Vilahamn has breathed new life into a team that flirted with relegation at times in 2022-23.

I was just starting out in journalism and there he was on TV one day; filling the screen, telling a story with his unique combination of sensitivity and authority. What story it was, or even what country he was in, I cannot recall, but I remember looking at him and thinking – there is someone from a background like mine, a south Asian, who is a foreign correspondent. It was a huge deal; this was surely the most glamorous and exciting job in the world, and all of a sudden I saw a person who looked like me doing it.</p><p>It was only after I met George several years later that I came to know his many personal qualities and appreciated <em>how</em> he did the job as well as the mere fac

This competition has regularly witnessed the best of Rangers. What their city rivals, Celtic, would give for swimming so comfortably in a bigger pond.

<p>The Detectorists actor discusses his new drama about a scandalous miscarriage of justice – and what Monty Python has in common with Boris Johnson</p><p>I am waiting on a mezzanine in a fancy establishment in Shoreditch in east London, when I hear a bounding tread, full of enthusiasm, taking steps two at a time. “I wonder why a kid is coming up here,” I think to myself. Then Toby Jones, 57, arrives. I’m surprised by how chic and urbane he looks, the nippy tailoring on his earth-coloured casual wear: but that’s because I’d spent the week watching Mr Bates vs the Post Office. The new ITV drama tells the story of the class action suit that had Alan Bates, a&nbsp;former post office operator at Craig-y-Don, in Llandudno, at its centre. Bates, an unassuming crusader for justice, is a lot of things – his rock-solid moral compass has its own charisma, by the time Jones has finished playing him – but he is emphatically not chic or urbane.</p><p>The scandal is one of the largest miscarriages

In 1609, an&nbsp;English ship, the Sea Venture, foundered on reefs 600 miles off the coast of America, and its passengers, who were on their way to bolster the colony of Virginia, set up temporary camp on the island of Bermuda. The&nbsp;shipwreck could have ended in disaster for the colonisers, but over 10&nbsp;months on the island, they feasted on so many turtles that an act of parliament had to be passed to condemn their example, and they decimated the population of the cahow, a native seabird. Once the colonisers had been rescued, Bermuda’s larder became a lifeline for&nbsp;Virginia, which was on the brink of&nbsp;annihilation through starvation and&nbsp;disease. Financiers increased their investments. But the colonisers’ gain was the natural world’s tragedy, and the episode mar

<p>What’s the reason for our increasingly bumpy air travel – and does it mean a crash is more likely?</p><p>Friday 24 February 2023, an afternoon flight. I’m travelling from Charleston, South Carolina, to New York’s LaGuardia airport after a vacation with my kids and a friend. In&nbsp;the last few years, I’ve become sufficiently weird about flying to check in advance for high wind, and today, unfortunately, it’s windy. After takeoff, the captain informs us that once we get below 10,000ft, he’ll be advising the stewards to stay seated. He uses the words a “few bumps”, which I tell myself sounds almost charming – Whoops-a-daisy! Just a few bumps! – and “moderate turbulence”, which is less reassuring. In airline parlance, “moderate”, I’m aware, means extremely unfun if you happen to be frightened of flying.</p><p>About 45 minutes before we’re scheduled to land, an attendant comes over the address system. “In light of the severe turbulence we’re expecting,” he says, “we&nbsp;need everyon

The Guardian’s sketch writer picks out some of the biggest rotters, from Suella and SBF to Elon Musk and Lord Dave</p><p>The great debate used to centre on whether the former home secretary was just very dim or very vindictive. The answer to this conundrum now appears to be both. First, we had her enthusiastic support of the Rwanda policy. The idea of sending small boats refugees to a country that has been <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/rwanda-high-court-un-refugees-b2161067.html">deemed unsafe</a> by the United Nations.

If we didn’t have to eat, we could just stay in bed until February.
