<p>Anything is possible, Erik ten Hag had claimed, if Manchester United brought their A-game. And yet it still felt outlandish to really believe they were about to beat Bayern Munich, let alone have the other Group A game between Copenhagen and Galatasaray end in a draw; the double whammy to save their skin.</p><p>United, after all, have not beaten a top-ranked team during this traumatic season. They have only won once against opponents that currently sit in the top half of the Premier League table – and that was 10th-placed Fulham. They were not terrible, they competed, they were not blown away by the champions of Germany. These are the kind of positives for which their fans must scrape.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/dec/12/manchester-united-bayern-munich-champions-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

Everyone seems eager for the burial, eager to help, insincere in their mourning, “a-sighing and sobbing”.</p><p>Everything is small. The fish catching blood in his “little dish”, the rook playing parson with his “little book”. The death of a little bird, and a funeral for a bird the size, and almost the shape, of an orange, and weighing no more than an orange segment.</p><p>One of the electrons migrates a few nanometers aw
