		The Yemen National Payments Company (MEPSYemen) will now integrate <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/irisguard-inc">IrisGuard</a>’s EyePay Network iris biometrics-based payments into its platform, according to an announcement. The platform has been tailored to meet the needs of NGOs and government entities and will be deployed at banks, ATMs, retail shops and mobile wallet agencies, among other places.

The integration will give beneficiaries access to food, goods, health services, and other forms of assistance without asking for additional documents. Once an individual registers their iris biometrics with the system, they will be prompted to submit an iris scan only for proof-of-life. The newly integrated platform will accelerate financial inclusion

		Digital ID and biometrics are making news in health care through vendor leadership, new business and me-too marketing.

The most significant market move this week is the announcement that Fran Rosch, CEO of enterprise authentication service firm <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/forgerock">ForgeRock</a>, will become CEO of digital identity security firm <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/imprivata">Imprivata</a> next month.

Rosch had led ForgeRock for five years and ushered the firm into a SaaS model before announcing the switch.

Imprivata's exiting chief executive, Gus Malezis, will be a strategic advisor. Malezis had led the firm for seven years. His new role is "expanded" but the company describes it no further.

		The good news: The U.S. government has a plan for replacing some airport security staff with self-screening terrorist stations.

The bad news: Travelers in the near future could be shucking their shoes, belts and keys while speed-walking through a see-through security tunnel.

Twenty-three years after convincing travelers in the U.S. their lives depended on partially undressing for strangers in public facilities, the Department of Homeland Security wants to see if people will do the <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/news/2023/11/30/feature-article-self-service-screening-option-coming-airport">same thing on their own</a>.

		While smart cameras are designed for facial recognition systems, they are not limited to this specific function. Aside from facial recognition, they are used in tasks such as object detection, motion detection, audio detection, remote monitoring, analytics and insights, and their integration with smart home systems. How well-suited they are to face biometrics applications depends on the resolution and other characteristics of the images they capture, but also the capacity the cameras have to store and process images.

This article will focus on two of the leading smart camera models specifically tailored for facial recognition systems. Their memory usage when processing facial recognition software is considered, their potential capacity for storing facial recognition

		A request for information <a href="https://sam.gov/opp/75306742643145f4ab35c3202898e50b/view">published</a> by the U.S. federal government has raised the profile of biometric surveillance of undocumented immigrants, but neither the monitoring nor the private-prison industries appear to think much will come of it soon.

In public statements, two major industry players are submitting information for the August request, and they both sound like they would compete hammer and tongs for it.

Yet one of the companies, CoreCivic, seems to have dedicated no real estate on its site to biometric products it makes or uses.

In fact, it is not obvious what electronics it is using when it comes to would-be immigrants who the government judge safe and reliable enough to set free until their

But rights groups are warning that the regulation still has loopholes that leave migrants and asylum seekers without protection from AI biometric systems.

A <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/01634437231214193">research article</a> published on the eve of the AI Act’s passage argues that the bloc’s mandatory biometric data collection practices deprive migrants in the Eurozone of agency.
