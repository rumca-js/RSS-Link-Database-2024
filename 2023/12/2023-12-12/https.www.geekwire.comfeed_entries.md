The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Seattle, is based in part on allegations in the Federal Trade Commission&#8217;s separate antitrust lawsuit against Amazon. An unredacted version of the FTC complaint, made public last month, includes a section that details what the FTC describes as Amazon&#8217;s anticompetitive tactics against Zulily and&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/zulily-sues-amazon-alleging-that-price-fixing-and-suppler-coercion-sunk-its-attempts-to-compete/">Read More</a>
