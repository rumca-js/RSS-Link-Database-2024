When looking to make a sequel to your blockbuster title, adding in a second character to a single player game probably doesn’t make it to your Top 10 List of things to do. However, if you happen to be Sam Lake, Creative Director of Remedy Entertainment, and Jon Paquette, the Senior Narrative Director behind Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, that’s exactly what you do to change up the narrative and keep the audience engaged.

Both Sam and Jon sat down at the IGN table to talk about whatever they wanted to talk about and dive into topics that only those who love the story of games can know about.

It’s been a long and bumpy road leading up to the release of “The Day Before,” the open-world post-apocalyptic MMO was at one point the most wishlisted game on Steam, following an impressive early reveal. But gradually, that hype turned into skepticism, wondering if developer Fntastic could deliver on its ambitious vision. Well, we finally have an answer: nope. Less than a week since the game launched into early access, the studio has announced it will be shutting down, and doesn’t have the necessary funding to continue its support. In a statement posted on X, Fntastic wrote “The Day Before has failed financially, and we lack the funds to continue. All income received is being used to pay off debts to our partners.” There’s also rumors the studio behind TimeSplitters might be closing its doors as well, and if you think there’s an official chronological order to The Legend of Zelda games, series producer Eiji Aonuma has some words for you.
