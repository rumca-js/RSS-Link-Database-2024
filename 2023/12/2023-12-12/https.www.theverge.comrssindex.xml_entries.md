  <p id="zy9pBh"><a href="https://newsroom.snap.com/snapchat-plus-seven-million-new-ways-to-create-caption-and-snap">Snapchat is getting even more generative AI</a> features. The messaging app now lets Snapchat Plus subscribers create images based on a text prompt and send them to friends.</p>
<p id="eDQevQ">Those who subscribe to Snapchat’s $3.99 plan can use the feature by tapping the “AI” button from the toolbar on the right side of the camera interface. This opens up a window where users can type a text prompt or choose from one of the premade options, like “a futuristic disco” or “a rocket preparing for liftoff.” </p>

  <p id="PDoZXq">In the early ’10s, Twitter was at the height of its power. The company had yet to turn a profit, but it <em>had</em> played a crucial role in the Arab Spring and Occupy Wall Street, which was nearly as effective for recruiting. While it would never reach the scale of its competitors, the platform dominated in terms of cultural and political relevance. Twitter was fast, its reach was far, and its influence was shaping the world in ways that seemed progressive. </p>

<p id="Eys6Tw">The first tweet was already unsettling. It was a composite image of things I’d said — largely dug up from five years earlier — screencaps of posts with tiny archive links appended to each one. Out of context, some of my old posts looked bad. The bulk were obviously jokes. Most of them were about white people. </p>

  <p id="0epNoO">Here is a very dumb truth: for a decade, the default answer to nearly every problem in mass media communication involved Twitter. Breaking news? Twitter. Live sports commentary? Twitter. Politics? Twitter. A celebrity has behaved badly? Twitter. A celebrity has issued a Notes app apology for bad behavior? Twitter. For a good while, the most reliable way to find out what a loud noise in New York City was involved asking Twitter. Was there an earthquake in San Francisco? Twitter. Is some website down? Twitter.</p>

Then, he killed it literally: renaming it X, giving Twitter a final ending after 15 years of chaotic existence. </p>
<p id="Rmt04o">But in death, there is understanding — now that it’s over, we can reckon with what Twitter really was: a news cycle accelerator, a tool of mass harassment, an idealistic money-losing workplace, and an infinite joke machine.</p>
