The estate of Dr. Seuss is obviously no stranger to playing the intellectual property maximalist, having appeared on our pages many times in the past. But more specifically for this post, the estate has also, ironically enough, been more than happy to stomp on the Christmas joy of others in favor of jealously guarding its [&#8230;]

Over a decade ago, I pointed out that as Google kept trying to worm its way deeper into our lives, a key Achilles&#8217; heel was its basically non-existent customer service and unwillingness to ever engage constructively with users the company fucks over. At the time, I dubbed it Google’s “big, faceless, white monolith” problem, because [&#8230;]

On August 11, the Marion County PD &#8212; with the assistance of the Kansas Department of Revenue, the county sheriff&#8217;s office, and (for some fucking reason) the local fire marshal &#8212; raided the office of the Marion County Record, along with the home of its co-owner, 98-year-old Joan Meyer. The raid was prompted by the [&#8230;]

Last week, we wrote about the potential for Senator Josh Hawley to “hotline” the bill that he put together with Senator Richard Blumenthal to remove Section 230 from anything touching artificial intelligence. As we noted at the time, even if you hate both generative AI technology and Section 230, the bill was so poorly drafted [&#8230;]

Oh Elon. As we’ve discussed, Elon is infatuated with Community Notes as a sort of crowdsourced alternative to actually funding a trust &#38; safety staff and tooling. And while we actually like Community Notes and think more social media should use similar tools, it’s simply not a full trust &#38; safety replacement. But, over the [&#8230;]

We&#8217;ve long noted how the FCC (regardless of party) largely ignores how muted competition and monopolization drives up prices for consumers. The agency often talks a good (if ambiguous) game about &#8220;bridging the digital divide,&#8221; but they don&#8217;t collect and share pricing data proving market failure, nor are they capable of admitting monopolies exist and [&#8230;]

The NYPD&#8217;s refusal to engage in nearly any form of accountability means it&#8217;s up to the city&#8217;s residents to pay billions for police work that adds tens of millions to the tab with lawsuit settlements. In 2022, the NYPD cost residents $121 million in settlements. This came on top of the NYPD&#8217;s budget, which cleared [&#8230;]
