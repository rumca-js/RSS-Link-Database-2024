<p>Netflix has published the first of a new twice-a-year engagement report called “What We Watched.” The first installment, <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/what-we-watched-a-netflix-engagement-report">launched</a> Tuesday as a Microsoft Excel file, lists the hours viewed for every title (original and licensed) that has tallied more than 50,000 viewing hours. Although it’s an uneven performance comparison since episodic series will rack up many more hours than standalone films, this is the first ultra-detailed glimpse at what people watch on Netflix.</p>
<p>The first spreadsheet, covering January to June 2023, includes 18,214 entries of eligible content. The first season of the action-thriller series <em>The Night Agent: Season 1</em> sat comfortably at the top with 812,100,000 hours during that period. Following (far behind) in second place was season two of the drama <em>Ginny &amp; Georgia</em> (665,100,000 hours). Rounding out the top five are

<p>The Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses are about to get some powerful upgrades thanks to improvements to the social network’s AI assistant. The company is finally <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.threads.net/@boztank/post/C0w5Vz3r0h0"><ins>adding support</ins></a> for real-time information to the onboard assistant, and it’s starting to test new “multimodal” capabilities that allow it to answer questions based on your environment.</p>
<p>Up to now, Meta AI had a “knowledge cutoff” of December 2022, so it couldn’t answer questions about current events, or things like game scores, traffic conditions or other queries that would be especially useful while on the go. But that’s now changing, according to Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth, who said that all Meta smart glasses in the United States will now be able to access real-time info. The change is powered “in part” by Bing, he added.</p>

<p>Apple is adding a new iPhone feature called Stolen Device Protection that limits what thieves can do with a stolen phone and passcode. Created following a <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-iphone-security-theft-passcode-data-privacya-basic-iphone-feature-helps-criminals-steal-your-digital-life-cbf14b1a">report</a> earlier this year by the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>’s Joanna Stern, the opt-in feature is <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/personal-tech/apple-iphone-ios-update-stolen-device-protection-698d760e">included</a> in the iOS 17.3 beta, now available for developers. It works using a combination of location, biometric scans, and time delays, allowing victims to lock out the perpetrator and safeguard their data.</p>
<p>Stolen Device Protection aims to snuff out a common practice among iPhone thieves in public places, who watch users enter their passcode before snatching the device and bolting. In such cases, the pe

<p>A Senate Finance Committee inquiry revealed on Tuesday that police departments can get access to private medical information from pharmacies, no warrant needed. While HIPAA may protect some access to personally identifiable health data, it doesn't stop cops, according to <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.finance.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/hhs_pharmacy_surveillance_letter_signed.pdf">a letter</a> from Senator Ron Wyden, Representative Pramila Jayapal and Representative Sara Jacobs to the Department of Health and Human Services. None of the major US pharmacies are doing anything about it, either, the members of Congress say.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"All of the pharmacies surveyed stated that they do not require a warrant prior to sharing pharmacy records with law enforcement agents, unless there is a state law that dictates otherwise," the letter said. "Those pharmacies will turn medical records over in response to a mere subpoena, which often do not have to be reviewed or signed by

<p>Sony’s investigating a possible ransomware attack at PlayStation subsidiary Insomniac Games, the makers of the beloved Spider-Man series. A hacking group called Rhysida has claimed credit for the alleged incident and announced that it’ll be selling any acquired data for $2 million within seven days if Insomniac and Sony don’t pay up, <a href="https://www.cyberdaily.au/culture/9931-spider-man-2-developer-insomniac-games-hit-by-rhysida-ransomware-attack">according to <em>Cyber Daily.</em></a></p>

<p>Once January 30 hits, you won’t be able to download or use Express from the website and license keys will expire. Additionally, any saved images and edits will go the way of the dodo, so get in there and finish up before next month.

<p>A new streaming device can make the experience of binge-watching a new TV show or marathoning your favorite movies feel like new again. Maybe you have an aging TV set that could use a pick-me-up, or you’re not a fan of the built-in OS that came with your smart TV. Streaming dongles like those from Amazon and Roku, plus set-top boxes like the Apple TV 4K, ubiquitous at this point, but sussing out the differences between them can be challenging. We’ve tested and reviewed numerous streaming devices over the years and these are eight of our top picks at the moment. We’ve also consolidated some helpful buying advice below that can help you decide which entertainment streaming device is right for you.</p>
<h2>Who needs a streaming device?</h2>
<p>It’s worth pointing out that if you only use a couple of streaming services (say, Netflix and Amazon Prime Video), you might not need a standalone streaming player. Most modern televisions ship with a basic selection of apps that usually includ

<p>Home theater projectors have come a long way from the clunky, dim models of the past. They’re brighter, sharper, more compact and easier than ever to install. Importantly, they also deliver a picture size you could never get on a standard TV (without spending a fortune at least) and with stellar image quality. Projectors are, increasingly, the best option for those who want a true, big-screen viewing experience that almost rivals sitting in a movie theater.<br /><br />Recently we’ve seen models bright enough to use in a normal room, short-throw models that take up very little space and have built-in sound bars, and better picture quality than ever with 4K and Dolby Vision features. Better still, you can now get 4K HDR models that can project an image size up to 150-inches for as little as $1,000.

<p>Apple is now rolling out iOS 17.2 to all compatible devices, as well as iPadOS 17.2 and macOS 14.2 Sonoma. The biggest addition in all those is the introduction, finally, of the long-teased <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ios-172-and-apples-new-journal-app-are-now-available-181348877.html">Journal app</a>.</p>
<p>Journal differs from third-party apps like Day One by offering journaling suggestions based on your iPhone activity. That can range from photos taken through to locations reached on maps or even what you’re listening to. Your device might also suggest creating a journal entry after things like workouts or a finished podcast episode. Apple’s hope with the app is to help “iPhone users reflect and practice gratitude through journaling.” So, thank you, Apple, for the iOS update.</p>

<p>BeReal is launching new features for its app, which won <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-2022-app-store-awards-094422535.html">Apple’s 2022 iPhone App of the Year</a>. The company tries to differentiate its platform by prompting spontaneous authenticity via randomly timed two-minute windows to take selfies. Now, it’s adding a feature similar to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-04-20-now-apples-live-photos-can-work-on-any-website.html">Apple’s Live Photos</a>. In addition, invite-only groups, tags and 2023 recaps are on their way to the “Your friends for real” platform.</p>
<p>Behind the Scenes (BTS) is BeReal’s branding for its Live Photos-esque feature. Like Apple’s version, BTS captures a video for a few seconds before taking a static shot. After posting, your friends can long-press on the shot to see the short video clip. BTS is an opt-in feature, so nobody should be sucked into it unwillingly, and you can toggle it anytime.</p>

<p>Google has been working to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-removing-movies-tv-section-play-store-123055503.html">phase out</a> the Play Movies &amp; TV brand and services ever since it launched its standalone TV app a few years ago. Now, the company seems to be making the last preparations for when Google Play Movies &amp; TV goes away for good in January. As <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/11/23997066/google-play-movies-tv-app-removal"><em>The Verge</em></a> reports, the company has released detailed instructions on how long-time customers can continue accessing the content they'd already purchased. Admittedly, it can be a bit confusing, since access depends on what device the viewer is using.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Starting on January 17, 2024, viewers will be able to access the movies and shows they'd purchased in the &quot;Your Library&quot; row under the Shop tab in Google Play... if they're watching on TVs and streaming devices powered by Android TV. If they're on A

<p>Tesla could sue at least some Cybertruck owners who flip their vehicles too soon, but it's unclear if the rule applies to all customers who buy the pickup truck and if it will remain in place for future buyers. A few weeks before the first deliveries for the Cybertruck went out, Tesla <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-fine-print-says-it-may-sue-cybertruck-resellers-for-50k-if-they-flip-it-too-soon-173137300.html">updated</a> its purchase agreement to add that it could seek injunctive relief to prevent owners from transferring their vehicle's title if they attempt to sell it within one year of buying it. Further, the company said it could seek &quot;liquidated damages&quot; from customers worth &quot;$50,000 or the value received as consideration for the sale or transfer, whichever is greater.&quot;</p>
