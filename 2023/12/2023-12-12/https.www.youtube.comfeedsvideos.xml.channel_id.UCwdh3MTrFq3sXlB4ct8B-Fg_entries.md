Scout Squads are Space Marines in training, deployed as infiltrators and skirmishers to prove their mettle in combat. In this Warhammer painting video, we’ll be painting a Scout Sergeant in the Chapter colours of the Raven Guard to a Battle Ready standard. Then we’ll add a few more paints and techniques to take your models to the next level.
