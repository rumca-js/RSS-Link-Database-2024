These are our very favorite Nintendo Switch games of 2023, showing just how strong the year has been for Nintendo's console-handheld hybrid. The Nintendo Switch is approaching its twilight years as persistent rumors of a successor start to seem imminent. You wouldn't know it's on its way out from the library, though, as this year is one of the strongest that the little console-handheld hybrid has ever seen. 

This year, the system put its biggest names forward with both a long-anticipated sequel to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, as well as a new mainline Super Mario Bros. game. We also got excellent remakes like Metroid Prime Remastered, and some notable third-party support. This list is all exclusives, meaning they can only be found on Nintendo Switch. If this is ultimately going to be the last year for the Nintendo Switch before a new console takes some of its shine, 2023 was a strong way to finish.
