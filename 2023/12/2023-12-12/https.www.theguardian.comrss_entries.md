It’s uplifting, tragic and very hard to resist – no matter how nauseating you find their cutesy terminology</p><p>There was a time, children, when you got all your Christmas crying done during Noel’s Christmas Presents. Noel Edmonds would give the perfect presents to lovely, deserving people who had been nominated by others for their loveliness and deservingness. Children who helped care for disabled siblings or relatives would get smashing bikes or great toys, but always with the message that this was just a token of how much their kindness was appreciated. Adults would get holidays or office equipment or something equally tangible for the charity they were running or the cause dearest to their hearts. Edmonds walked the line between mawkish and moving beautifully and you could count on it every year as the perfect purge for your high festive emotions.</p><p>Now you have to take what you can

The answer is fundamentally about implementation – how countries struggling to eradicate poverty and provide basic services (including energy) for their people fund the transition away from fossil fuels.</p><p>The “means of implementation” has become a sticking point at the talks, with developing countries united in demanding that developed countries honour their legally binding obligations under the Paris agreement. Developing countries that have contributed so little to the climate crisis but are suffering the worst impacts argue that a phase-out must be centred around equity, which means it must be “fast, fair, funded and forever”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/dec/12/why-implementation-matters-in-the-global-fight-again-the-climate-crisis">Contin

<p>Funded by four countries, starring Eva Green and featuring modern sexual tweaks, the trio’s new €72m Milady yarn was meant to rival Hollywood blockbusters. But is it another doomed Europudding?</p><p>Suitably honouring the spirit of Alexandre Dumas, the second half of the new two-part Three Musketeers film adaptation arrives with not one but two cliffhangers to resolve.

And second, there’s the question of whether this would-be Euro blockbuster is actually going to make its money back.</p><p>Co-produced by France, Germany, Spain and Belgium on a €72m budget across both instalments – putting it in the top 10 most expensive French productions ever – the films looked well provisioned to compete with Hollywood: big names such as Eva Green and Vincent Cassel, copious buckling of swashes and modernising tweaks such as a bisexual Porthos all gaily buttonhole the

But while audiences flock to supposedly cruel reality shows, will we ever see real change?</p><p>The tide is turning: reality TV is increasingly trying to clean up its act. Modern, socially conscious audiences are now hyper aware of participants being exploited or villainised, with producers’ attempts to make their shows more “ethical” ranging from psychological support before and after filming on Love Island, Married at First Sight UK (MAFS UK) and Big Brother, to contestants being prohibited from drinking excessive quantities of alcohol. There’s only one problem: how do you make a show that is both kind to participants and entertaining for viewers?</p><p>Arguably, cruelty remains deeply baked into the format of reality TV. Audiences don’t watch shows such as Married at First Sight or Selling Sunset to see blissed-out people behaving rationally. They tune in to see participants

This is 100% true: I did not feel ill when I left the house. My best guess for why I was streaming with snot and my eyeballs were on fire was that I was allergic to the pine-scented car-freshener in the Uber. “This is bound to pass,” I thought, as I waited for the camera to move somewhere else so I could blow my nose again.

I like that bit but it takes too long until that happens!”<br /><br />Why not try an update, thought Alsop. “I had always wanted to reimagine it – it lends itself to lots of different feels, and I wanted new audiences to hear the piece.” The 1741 work has been endlessly embellished, tweaked and reimagined, even by Handel himself. Mozart was commissioned to rewrite it with more woodwind. While Handel’s original choir had numbered 20 or so and the orchestra not many more, by the 1

Tom Phillips reports</p><p>He’s known as “the madman”, his hairdresser likens him to Wolverine, while the man himself prefers the term “anarcho-capitalist”.
