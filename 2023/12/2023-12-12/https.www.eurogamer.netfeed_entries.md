It's been five years since David Szymanski and New Blood Interactive's critically acclaimed retro FPS Dusk first emerged - effectively heralding start of the 'boomer shooter' resurgence as it did so - and to celebrate the occasion, a special "HD remaster" has been released as free DLC.
</p><p>
Dusk, with its furiously paced action and unapologetically chunky polygons, draws inspiration from the first-person shooter legends of the mid-90s - Quake being an obvious influence - taking players on a hellish Lovecraftian adventure deep beneath the Earth's surface. It's got cultists, a metal soundtrack, three campaign episodes, and a varied arsenal ranging from shotguns to crossbows and swords. It is a good time!
</p><p>
And now, five years after its release, Dusk is ready to careen into the modern era (assumin

It's all a bit Doom-y at the moment, what with the seminal first-person shooter having just celebrated its 30th anniversary this past weekend. And with perfect timing, original Doom designer John Romero has released Sigil 2, the follow-up to his 2019 unofficial Doom episode, which is available now as a free download for consoles and PC.
</p><p>
The original Sigil, which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/john-romero-announces-doom-spiritual-successor-sigil">announced to mark Doom's 25th back in 2018</a>, served as the unofficial fifth episode in the Doom saga, picking up after the events of Ultimate Doom's Thy Flesh Consumed; Sigil 2 - as you might very well imagine - serves as unofficial episode number six, spanning nine new maps that lead into the story of Doom 2.

The Electronic Entertainment Expo is officially no more.
</p><p>
The future of the convention was in doubt after the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/e3-2023-cancelled">2023 event was cancelled</a> and Reedpop, owner of events such as PAX and EGX (as well as Eurogamer), said in September it would <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/e3-2024-in-doubt-as-organiser-exits-and-location-abandoned">no longer work with the Entertainment Software Association (ESA) to relaunch the show</a>.
</p><p>
"After more than two decades of E3, each one bigger than the last, the time has come to say goodbye," reads a post on X, formerly Twitter, by the official E3 account. "Thanks for the memories."

It's more than fair to say that Bandai Namco has been on a bit of a winning streak as of late. Its impressively vast library of popular anime licences, paired with the release of heavy hitters like Elden Ring and Armored Core VI, have resulted in a string of profitable and, more often than not, critically well received games. Elden Ring DLC notwithstanding, Tekken 8 is set to be Bandai Namco's next big release - but what have the development team learned from Tekken 7's release to ensure the sequel's success?
</p><p>
A preview in late November finally gave me some insight. Story mode was capped up until the end of chapter 4 and we were only allowed to play a couple of the Arcade Mode chapters, but every character was available to try out in versus, practice and the Tekken Ball mode.

Atlus has released a new video with the developers of its forthcoming game Metaphor: ReFantazio, providing new details on how it adapts gameplay ideas from the Persona series.
</p><p>
The game's narrative will focus on a sort of fantasy election, for which the protagonist must travel the world and gather support to become king but with limited time.
</p><p>
A fresh story trailer for the game was revealed at last week's The Game Awards, you can check it out below.

<strong>This article contains Final Fantasy 16 spoilers.</strong>
</p><p>
If you've played Final Fantasy 16, you'll know the door I mean. Down a side path in The Dim is a circular stone door that never opens, a bizarre enigma in a game otherwise overflowing with detail. Throughout the game, it remains a tantalising glimpse of The Fallen leading to a towering spire in the distance. 
</p><p>
Until now! The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-16-dlc-echoes-of-the-fallen-out-now">newly released Echoes of the Fallen DLC</a> begins with some slow preamble to loosely set up Clive and Jill's visit behind the door, introducing a handful of new incidental characters. And then the door opens.

It's hard to think of another year in games quite like this, with such highs and lows. Endlessly brilliant and imaginative games, from Rytmos and Birth to Spider-Man 2 and Baldur's Gate 3, but also endless strife and lay-offs for the people who make games and work around them. At the end of the year we at least have a chance to say thanks for some of the incredible things we got to play.
