Then I actually HAD to sand some parts for a project, in order to make them perfectly smooth, and realised that I had probably just not been using a large enough grit to start previously. It only took like 3 minutes for each part to get them almost there using 100 grit, and only an additional 5 minutes with smaller grits to make them basically perfect and ready for painting.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ReplayTheMaster"> /u/ReplayTheMaster </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/18ayfv1/what_is_an_aspect_of_the_3d_printing_process/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/18ayfv1/what_is_an_aspect_of_the_3d_printing_process/">[comments]</a></span>
