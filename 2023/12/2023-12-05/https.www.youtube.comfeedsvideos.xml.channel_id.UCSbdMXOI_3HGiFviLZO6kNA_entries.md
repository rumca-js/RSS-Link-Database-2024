We got another good one! Quest 2, Quest 3 And Pro all recieve a pretty big update with V60- the pro receiving a pretty massive performance boost along with it! But that's not it! New haptic VR gloves are about to hit the market, some really cool VR research on temperature haptics, headstraps have halted sales and the lego VR game looks awesome! All that and so much more- I hope you enjoy!!!
