## Arizona Sunshine 2 Review

Arizona Sunshine 2 reviewed by Dan Stapleton on PC via Meta Quest 3 + Steam Link and Valve Index. Also available on Meta Quest 2/3 and PlayStation VR 2.

Time and time again, Arizona Sunshine 2 expertly ramps up the pressure of oncoming hordes of zombies and then rewards you with spectacular gore when your bullets and hatchets connect with rotten faces. Its VR shooting and relatively complex reloading mean you always have to be on your toes and thinking about how many bullets are left in your guns as you blast your way through a lengthy, occasionally poignant story about a man and his new four-legged best buddy. The variety of enemy types is pretty limited for a 15-plus-hour game, but there’s enough light puzzle-solving and climbing mixed in to keep it moving along, and the physics glitches provide as much humor as the one-liners and co-op antics.

## Wonka Review

Wonka reviewed by Tom Jorgensen.

Wonka is a celebration of music makers and the dreamers of dreams, a big, old-fashioned movie musical that uses Roald Dahl’s world just judiciously enough to avoid any serious hits to the author or Gene Wilder’s legacy. Timothée Chalamet’s portrayal of Willy Wonka is most successful in its earnestness, and Chalamet brings the character to life with a gleeful abandon that makes him easy to root for, along with an energetic supporting cast who end up carrying the banner of Wonka’s weirdness more than Wonka himself. Charming and well-staged musical numbers give the movie enough of an identity of its own to make it worthy of a taste – just remember to burp and fart if you start floating toward the ceiling at any time during your screening.

Here's how the Avatar Frontiers of Pandora Ikran scene was created! Ubisoft’s Avatar game offers us all the chance to visit the lush, forested homeworld of the Na’vi. And, at the very top of a floating mountain, you’ll be able to live out your own version of an iconic Avatar scene: taming and flying an Ikran.

But just as important as the Avatar Ikran scene and flight is the journey to the mountain’s summit; a climb full of incredible views, plants with strange abilities, and puzzles to solve. That climb is the centrepiece of the Avatar Take Flight quest, one of the Frontiers of Pandora milestone missions. It’s the work of dozens of developers, and we’ve spoken to several of them to find out how they made it. 

For more developer insights on Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, take a look at why the developers chose the first-person perspective: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Es2KioY2YdM

## Live-Action Fallout Creators Call Show "Fallout 5" - IGN The Fix: Entertainment

In today's Fix of entertainment news:
Jonathan Nolan, showrunner for Prime Video's Fallout series, said the show creators consider their live-action Fallout to be Fallout 5. While Bethesda hasn't confirmed whether or not the story in the Fallout show is actually Fallout 5 cannonically, they did tease a new Fallout game sometime down the road. Like, way down the road, as in sometime after The Elder Scrolls 6. In other news, Marvel Studios head Kevin Feige confirmed he has no plans to bring back Robert Downey, Jr's Iron Man. But we are getting a new kind of Iron Man in the form of Iron Heart and her Disney+ series. And finally, Zack Snyder has acquired the rights to a sequel to a movie he made more than a decade ago. Snyder may have plans to finally produce his version of a sequel to 300, and it may follow Alexander the Great. There was a sequel to 300 released—Rise of an Empire—but Snyder didn't have much to do with that movie.

In today's Daily Fix:
Rockstar's Grand Theft Auto 6 announcement was so huge, everyone's parodying it: from Rare, to Microsoft, to Activision. In other news, Sony has announced that it is pulling some PlayStation video content from the store, and from people's libraries even if they bought it. It has to do with licensing rights, but that's not consoling users who paid money for content.
