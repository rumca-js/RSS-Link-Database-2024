</p><p>
This year's event kicks off today, 5th December, on Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One, and runs right through to the end of the year on 31st December.
</p><p>
Microsoft has highlighted a number of indie games newly announced for Xbox and getting the demo treatment during Winterfest - including pirate adventure Captain Bones, turn-based rogue-lite dungeon crawler The Land Beneath Us, post-apocalyptic fantasy RPG Vagrus: The Riven Realms, and the self-explanatory Dinosaur Fossil Hunter - over on its <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2023/12/05/idxbox-game-demo-winterfest-showcase/">Xbox Wire blog</a>.

Wes Ball, the director of Nintendo's upcoming The Legend of Zelda movie, has discussed some of his ambitions for the project, saying he "would love to see a live-action Miyazaki" - a reference to legendary Studio Ghibli director Hayao Miyazaki, whose animated work includes Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke, and Laputa: Castle in the Sky.
</p><p>
Ball, who has previously helmed the three Maze Runner films and is currently working on next year's King of the Planet of the Apes, was announced as the director of Nintendo's live-action The Legend of Zelda movie last month, as part of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-is-working-on-a-live-action-the-legend-of-zelda-movie">project's official unveiling</a>.

Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration, the acclaimed interactive history of Atari from developer Digital Eclipse, has just added 12 more retro games as part of a free Holiday Content Update.
</p><p>
Atari 50, if you're unfamiliar, released at the tail-end of last year, drawing immediate acclaim for its wonderfully rich delve into Atari's 50-year history, mixing extensive interviews with designers, developers, and other prominent industry figures with archival content include documentary footage, design documents, and original artwork.
</p><p>
That in itself was an absolute treat, but Atari 50 also included more than 90 playable arcade and console games from the company's illustrious, industry defining back catalogue, ranging from Pong and Breakout to the likes of Asteroids, Adventure, and more. It even featured a number of previousl

## No, the Fallout TV show won't have bugs, at least not in season one

Amazon Prime's Fallout TV adaptation will not arrive with any references to bugs and glitches in its first season.
</p><p>
Bethesda is somewhat infamous for releasing some rather buggy games. These bugs are often amusing, and, in an odd way, an almost endearing feature that fans have come to expect with each release. 
</p><p>
But, despite them being a common Bethesda occurrence, the first season of Fallout will not include any playful references towards these unintentional video game issues, showrunners have now confirmed.

## The Batman: Arkham Trilogy on Nintendo Switch should never have shipped in this state

The trilogy - Arkham Asylum, Arkham City, and the spectacular Arkham Knight - are polished and beautiful action games. Their recent Switch ports, however, seem a little curious. The first two titles make sense, as PS3/Xbox 360-era games, but Arkham Knight was a boundary-pushing PS4/Xbox One title with visuals that require careful retooling to run effectively on Nintendo's low-power hybrid console. As you might have grasped from the headline, that hasn't happened with the Arkham Trilogy release - so what exactly went wrong and how do the two less-demanding titles hold up in comparison? </p><p>Let's start with Batman: Arkham Knight - which is an unmitigated disaster on Switch. There are a lot of problems here but performance is by f

Naughty Dog has revealed the characters we will be able to play as in The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered's No Return mode.
</p><p>
As a reminder, No Return is an all new roguelike survival mode, which is set to feature a range of playable characters from Part 2. This will include those we haven't played as before. 
</p><p>
Each of these characters has their own traits tailored for different playstyles. As players progress, more characters and skins can be unlocked. You can see a trailer for it all below.

It's just <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-will-release-on-xbox-series-xs-and-playstation-5-in-2025">one trailer</a>. Let's get that bit out of the way first. It's a single trailer, 90 seconds long - or really, about 77 seconds of actual footage - and of all the world's video game developers now, none are granted more benefit of the doubt, more pre-loaded, automatically qualified hype, than Rockstar. Nobody needs a breathless reaction to one trailer less. As other studios scrambled to meme Rockstar's announcement-of-an-announcement post the other day, dipping their own reveals and posts in neon pink and orange, Christian Donlan described it as like being in Jurassic Park. A herd of already majestic Brachiosaurus and Gallimimus quietly minding their business in a field - and suddenly: T

The first season for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 is set to arrive tomorrow, 6th December, across platforms. This will see a variety of in-game content added, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-a-look-at-call-of-duty-warzones-urban-battleground-urzikstan">new Warzone map Urzikstan</a>. This map will launch with 100 player count and, as noted by <a href="https://twitter.com/charlieINTEL/status/1731743832331506009">CharlieIntel</a>, it is 20 percent smaller than the series' Al Mazrah map.
</p><p>
This has led some players to lament the comparatively condensed player numbers for each match. Typically, Warzone hosts 150-player lobbies.  However, developer Raven Software explained its decision in a post on X, formerly Twitter, stating it will ensure a good gameplay balance.

Fntastic, developer of zombie MMO The Day Before, has apologised for its marketing ahead of the game's release later this week.

The developer shared a statement shared on X, formerly Twitter, addressed to future players, supporters, and people who "didn't believe in us".
</p><p>
To the latter, Fntastic said: "We made this game for you, too. We accept any kind of criticism and don't hold a grudge against you."

After years of waiting, Rockstar has finally given us our first slice of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a>. In the new trailer, we are introduced to the game's protagonists, Lucia and Jason, and the crime-riddled world that they live in. This is Vice City, GTA's take on Miami, Florida.
</p><p>
I am now going to break down the trailer, listing all the little things I noticed. While the whole thing's only 91 seconds in length (which is admittedly more than we got for GTA5), the studio has managed to pack a lot in. The trailer gives us a real sense of what we can expect on the game's eventual release, which is currently slated for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-will-release-on-xbox-series-xs-and-playstation-5-in-2025">2025 across PS5 and Xbox Series consoles</a>.

GTA 6 will release in 2025 on both Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5, Rockstar has confirmed.

There's no mention as yet of a PC version of the game.

A surprise discovery I made a little way into A Highland Song, the latest from Overboard and Heaven's Vault developer Inkle: it doesn't matter if you fall off a cliff. This, I think, is quite weird for a climbing game. And especially one where a sense of peril seems at first to be such a central part of what it's trying to do. As a girl named Moira, you must run from a miserable home in the Scottish highlands to visit your uncle, at a faraway lighthouse. You spend a week, or probably more, scrabbling up the side of mountains, sheltering from storms in cave mouths, spelunking into dead ends in search of directional clues - you've no actual map, by the way - and you do this racing against both a shrinking health bar and each day's ever-fading sun.
</p><p>
But! No actual peril. Fall off or run out of health and you just

As Chris Tapsell pointed out a while back, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grand-theft-auto-5-is-so-much-more-than-its-misanthropy">every GTA game is love wrapped in satire</a>. The series seems edgy because the satire is very broad, and often fairly misdirected. But the series sells - and the individual games stick around for so long - because after thirty hours of playing, you're responding purely to the love. Love of the genre, certainly. Love of the excess, sure. But love of the characters too and, more than anything, love of place.
