<p>Actress Margot Robbie has once again commented on the possibility of making another Barbie movie, saying she can't rule it out. <a href="https://twitter.com/Variety/status/1732072337321742785">Speaking to Variety</a>, Robbie said she and the team "put everything" in the first Barbie, which is 2023's highest-grossing movie worldwide with more than $1.4 billion. She said she's proud of the fact that Barbie had so much success as an original movie in a landscape dominated by sequels, prequels, and remakes. Going back and making a sequel might be challenging for a number of reasons, Robbie said, but she didn't close the door entirely.</p><p>"Part of me is like, 'Oh no, if we do a Barbie 2 then...' I don't know. But then at the same time, I would do anything to be back on that set. I'd do anything to be back on that set with [director Greta Gerwig] again; with [Ken actor Ryan Gosling] again. Playing Barbie is just so joyful. So it's not no but also it would take a lot for it to live up

<p>I am one of those people who was a little confused as to why <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-last-of-us-part-ii/">The Last of Us Part II Remastered</a> was launching with a roguelike mode. You could argue that the nature of Part II's story and its analysis of the cyclical nature of revenge and grief lends itself to the structure of a roguelike, but the remaster's new No Return mode is devoid of the storytelling of the main game. Instead, it offers an avenue for players to reacquaint themselves with and master Part II's excellent combat mechanics. That's not nothing, but it certainly feels like an odd addition to a franchise that primarily leans on its storytelling. And so my first question for The Last of Us Part II Remastered game director Matthew Gallant--who served as lead systems designer for the original game--was fairly straightforward: "Why do this?"</p><p dir="ltr">"When we were looking at making The Last of Us Part II Remastered, we were looking at what were s

<p>The highly-anticipated Willy Wonka prequel, simply called Wonka, starring Timothee Chalamet tells the story of a young Wonka trying to establish himself as the sorcerer of sugar we know he eventually becomes.

<p dir="ltr">The Last Of Us Part 2 Remastered was announced last month, and one of the most interesting new features it will add is a roguelike survival mode called No Return. Naughty Dog has now released a trailer that shows what players can expect when they take on the Infected, Clickers and more in this all-new way to play.</p><p dir="ltr">No Return will let players choose between multiple familiar faces from TLOU2, with Dina, Jesse, Lev, and Manny all shown on the character-select screen. Other names seen on the character menu include Ellie, Joel, Abby, Tommy, and Mel.</p><p dir="ltr">Players will find weapons and mods throughout a run, which will allow them to slowly power up as they battle more powerful enemies. When a player dies, they’ll be able to start again, but the weapon mods found in subsequent runs will be randomized.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered-trailer-shows-off-roguelike-no-return-mode/1100-6519693/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi
