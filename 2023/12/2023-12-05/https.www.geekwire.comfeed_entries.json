The idea, Amazon says, is to get products closer to customers more efficiently and cost-effectively, in line with its latest strategy of putting comprehensive sets of inventory at each of its regional fulfillment hubs. Under the new fee structure, announced Tuesday morning, sellers will be able to reduce or avoid the new &#8220;inbound placement fees,&#8221; the company says, if they opt to send their&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2023/amazon-restructures-seller-fees-to-match-its-regional-fulfillment-strategy-amid-ongoing-ftc-lawsuit/\">Read More</a>", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2023/amazon-restructures-seller-fees-to-match-its-regional-fulfillment-strategy-amid-ongoing-ftc-lawsuit", "date_published": "2023-12-05T18:00:00+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "GeekWire", "album": "GeekWire", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://www.geekwire.com/wp-content/themes/geekwire/dist/images/geekwire-logo-rss.png", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed/", "title": "Center lands $30M to bolster corporate expense software, explore potential bank partnerships", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"840\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2CenterCard-Travel-Expense-1260x840.jpg\" width=\"1260\" /><br />Center has found a formula for its expense software business, offering a corporate credit card with a real-time analytics platform used by more than 1,000 middle-market companies. Now the Seattle-area startup is exploring new ways to grow by building APIs and potentially partnering with banks. A fresh $30 million investment announced Tuesday will help support those plans for the Bellevue, Wash.-based company. The Series C round, which includes participation from Top Tier Capital and Durable Capital Partners, brings total funding for the 6-year-old company to $140 million. GeekWire previously reported on the funding last week after spotting a SEC filing.&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2023/center-lands-30m-to-bolster-corporate-expense-software-explore-potential-bank-partnerships/\">Read Mor", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2023/center-lands-30m-to-bolster-corporate-expense-software-explore-potential-bank-partnerships", "date_published": "2023-12-05T13:00:00+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "GeekWire", "album": "GeekWire", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://www.geekwire.com/wp-content/themes/geekwire/dist/images/geekwire-logo-rss.png", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed/", "title": "IonQ opens up Forte quantum computing platform for use on Amazon Braket Direct", "description": "<img alt=\"Illustration: IonQ Forte Enterprise quantum servers\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"664\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/231204-forte-ent3.png\" width=\"1220\" /><br />IonQ has opened up its most advanced quantum computing platform for public availability through Amazon&#8217;s cloud-based Braket Direct Program, even as the Maryland-based company gears up to produce even more advanced hardware at a Seattle-area manufacturing facility.
