Hello guys and gals, it's me Mutahar again! I want to make it known I do not promote piracy of content. Sony has recently revoked access to content that some of you have purchased all without any form of compensation. Sony has shown that purchasing from them means you do not own your product in any capacity and if you want to actually own what you buy, you should purchase from other storefronts. What they've done should be illegal. Thanks for watching!
