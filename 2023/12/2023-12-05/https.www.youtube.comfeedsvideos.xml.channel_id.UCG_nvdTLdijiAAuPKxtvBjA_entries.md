47 Ronin is a Samurai tale set in Feudal Japan with Keanu Reeves as the "star". Despite being an outcast, Keanu must use his samurai sword skills to fight magical beasts and witches to save the hot princess. It just didn't work out so well, seeing as the movie became a flop and lost around a 100 million dollars. So today, let's try to see why. Why do the exciting elements of the movie go to waste? (Quite similar to my video on Seventh Son â€” How to Build a Cinematic Nightmare).
