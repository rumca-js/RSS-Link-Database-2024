		An identity tool startup says it has pushed out passkey software for developers wanting a faster, more customizable authentication for their applications.

<a href="https://stytch.com/">Stytch</a> says its Passkeys offering is a competitive platform, one that the vendor hopes is entering a growing market for consumer-focused passkey authentication. Many is the prediction that passwords are dying off as a security tactic but many more are the passwords on sticky notes on monitors.

The <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/stytch">company</a> says its customizable API-based software simplifies cross-platform implementations. The customizability enables developers to bury the software within the look and flow of an application.

		<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/rank-one-computing-corporation">Rank One Computing</a> (ROC.ai) has announced the launch of their iris recognition software, complementing its established business lines in face and fingerprint biometrics, as well as weapons and object detection.

In <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/IREX10/">NIST’s IREX evaluation</a>, ROC.ai has the fastest mean search speed of all vendors at 0.11 seconds when tested on a database of 1 million iris scans, with an algorithm submitted in October. It also has a true match accuracy in searching two eyes at 99.3 percent and false positive identification rate of 1.0 percent.

According to a release, ROC.ai managed to create an algorithm with a competitive speed in less than six months, demons

		The lack of a data protection impact assessment has scuttled Kenya’s government’s rollout of the Maisha Namba national digital ID project, with the country’s High Court ruling it must pause. The court intervention is a repeat of a decision that ultimately marked the beginning of the end of the digital ID scheme’s predecessor, Huduma Namba.

The implementation of the associated chip-bearing physical identity card, digital ID, unique personal identifier (UPI) and National Master Population Register must all halt until the project is compliant with Kenya’s Data Protection Act, <a href="https://techcabal.com/2023/12/05/kenya-halts-roll-out-of-digital-ids/">TechCabal</a> reports.

		Fed up with identity fraud, the Business Council of Australia is stumping for a national digital ID. It has posted for recommendations for the government and while they are anodyne, it's hard to argue against their effectiveness.

		Dozens of civil society organizations have renewed their demand that the EU stop expanding the capabilities of its biometric asylum-registration infrastructure.

Expressing their opposition in <a href="https://edri.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/EURODAC-database-coalition-statement.pdf">an open letter</a>, they say expansion likely will threaten the human rights of would-be migrants.

		California regulators have <a href="https://cppa.ca.gov/meetings/materials/20231208_item2_draft.pdf">published draft rules</a> for automated decision making.

Broad and sweeping guidelines would govern consumer access and opt-out rights regarding use of the algorithms by businesses collecting personally identifiable data including biometrics.

Business advocates say what has been released is unworkably vague. If approved, the regulations would be nestled in California's Consumer Privacy Act, or <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/ccpa">CCPA</a>.

The agency's draft defines automated decision-making technology as "any system, software, or process," which is indeed broad. A representative of tech lobby organization NetChoice told <a href="https://news.bloomberg

		A database dubbed the National Education Repository and Databank (NERD) put in place to manage a student loans scheme in Nigeria has been greeted with mixed feelings. So too have criticisms rocked a similar move in the Bengal region of India where regional authorities have directed the collection of biometrics for the registration of marriages, separate from biometrics collected for the Aadhaar digital ID. Observers say these duplicative databases do not only sometimes breed inconveniences, they also present great data security risks.
