Jesus was prominent in the creation of goals one and three while he scored the second himself. Saka, meanwhile, on the occasion of his 200th Arsenal appearance, set up the opener for Gabriel Martinelli and had a role to play in the two that followed. Both players shimmered with menace throughout.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/dec/05/luton-arsenal-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

Even in the immediate aftermath of Saturday’s 5-0 trouncing of Sheffield United it was hard to truly quantify the weight of victory and the more cynical were certainly vindicated here.</p><p>This was always going to be a tougher test and Hwang Hee-chan’s neat finish extended Burnley’s sorry away run. If there was any doubt the remainder of this season remains an uphill challenge, then this was it, with Wolves coming out on top despite one of their more unconvincing performances under Gary O’Neil.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/dec/05/hwang-on-target-as-wolves-bring-burnley-crashing-back-to-reality">Continue reading...</a>

But it’s a room bursting with life, where bold, radical colours bloom in narrative scenes crammed with activity</p><p></p><p></p><p>It was a gossipy aside that was to shape art history. After seeing Titian’s latest painting in his studio, the Florentine Michelangelo praised it to Titian’s face but on the way home commented backhandedly to his friend and biographer Giorgio Vasari that it was a shame these Venetian artists didn’t learn to draw. Over the centuries, the contrast between Florentine “design” and Venetian “colour” became a cliche. It even stoked up William Blake to rage at the Royal Academy for promoting soft Venetian colourism against the true tradition of drawing.</p><p>Pesellino at the National Gallery overturns that simplistic view in a jewel case of a gallery where golden searchlights illuminate a universe of colour straight out of 15th-century Flore

It was a dismal December day, and Steven Seymour, hired to interpret during the arrival ceremony, got very cold while waiting for the presidential plane in the freezing rain. Carter began his address with a greeting, before going on to say: “When I left the United States this morning …” Seymour’s translation, “When I abandoned the United States …”, made the Polish-speakers in the audience chuckle. The president then said he was there to “understand your desires for the future”. Seymour’s rendition of it, translated back into English as “I desire the Poles”, was <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1978/01/10/steven-seymour-tells-how-it-is-to-be-famous/bcc2dc0b-b4cc-46b7-a14d-177e77f10d2e/">reported</a> in newspapers around the world.</p><p>Back inside from the cold, Seymour admitted he might have used the occasiona

<p>The rough-around-the-edges docudrama of cops misusing their power seems even more provocative today</p><p>“Many of his fellow officers considered him the most dangerous man alive – an honest cop.”</p><p>That was the tagline for the rabble-rousing cop docudrama Serpico when it premiered 50 years and it’s astonishing, in retrospect, that Paramount Pictures slapped it on top of the poster and advertising, and that audiences turned out in large numbers to see it. The tagline accurately reflects the film’s central thesis: that institutional corruption is so pervasive in the New York police department – and, by implication, city departments across the country – that a cop interested in simply doing his job on the level would face impossible (and potentially fatal) obstacles. But to bring a sentiment like that into the mainstream feels impossible in the Hollywood of today, which would never risk alienating the Blue Lives Matter crowd.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/de

<p>He’s posh, she’s not.

This chirpy romcom sequel from Prime Video has got the warm blanket familiarity you would get from a feature-length British telly Christmas special; something to put on while you fight over who gets the last Malteser in the Celebrations tub. Sex Education’s Asa Butterfield and Cora Kirk return as James and Hayley, a couple in their final year at uni. He’s a pleasant posho, she’s working class from Huddersfield. Last time they accidentally spent Christmas apart: each with the other one’s families. This year, they’re bringing their clans together for a festive getaway on the ski slopes. Hilarity – well, sitcommy cock-ups and culture-clash cliches – ensues.</p><p>In time-honoured Ch

Aberystwyth’s beaches, like those of Borth and Aberdyfi to the north, are storm beaches, which move with the sea’s weather and moods. At this time of year, they shift daily – sometimes even more often. The largely slate shingle beach that holiday folk know from summer is gone and replaced with sand.</p>

Over time, you realize that the water around you is rising. The only way to avoid being inundated is to build a 10ft-high wall. That’s a big project. It will take uncommon levels of resources and cooperation. Everyone will have to set aside their differences and work together – fast. It won’t be easy. But the alternative is destruction.</p><p>That sounds like a lot of work, though. And the water isn’t here yet. So you build a 1ft-high wall, and keep a positive attitude.

<p>From psychology to AI, pandemics to popular culture, we<em> </em>survey the bigger picture</p><p>Do you often find yourself dancing the “reasonable tango”? This is what the sociologist Kirsty Sedgman, in <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/on-being-unreasonable-9780571366859?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article" title="">On Being Unreasonable</a> (Faber), calls the kind of polite argument that acknowledges the opponent’s point with a “Yes, but …” and carries on indefinitely, with no mutual agreement in sight. In this bracing manifesto for being just a little less civilised, she considers subjects such as what should count as bad behaviour in the theatre, what “reasonable” means in law, and why we should not “debate” with fascists. (Sunlight is not the best disinfectant, she points out; bleach is.) Does being meek ever bring about justice? Is performative “reasonableness” really a cloak for the “terrifying thrill of self-righteousness”? T

<p>Whether you settle on Mathilda, Deke or Ebenezer, it’s bound to be exactly the right name. My own son is living proof</p><p>People who are expecting a baby spend an incredible amount of time talking about what to call it. This is probably a diversion away from difficult questions, such as: “What if I’m bad at being a parent, and society shuns me?” or: “What if this ruins our relationship, which is currently very beautiful?” As such, the naming debate is a brilliant one. The rest is way too hard.</p><p>Newsflash, though: it doesn’t actually matter what you call your child. The baby is bigger than the word. As soon as that is its name, that is its only possible name. For ages, you’ll think your baby is the one true carrier of the name, and everyone else called Mathilda is faking it.</p><p>Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/dec/05/worried-about-naming-your-baby-dont-be">Continue reading...</a>

At the JW3 centre in London – an arts and community venue for “the Jewish, Jew-ish and Jew curious”, according to Will Galinsky, JW3’s programming director – the cast of the first professional stage production to merge two great traditions in Jewish storytelling and festive panto are gathered around a table sharing their experiences of both.

<p>This action film about a smuggler and the cop on her tail invites comparisons to the Michael Mann thriller – which it conspicuously fails to live up to</p><p>The plot of this trite crime thriller revolves around two women: desperate single mother Holly (Danielle C Ryan), who gets caught up in smuggling black market pharmaceuticals, and PTSD-afflicted veteran and FBI field agent Jaylynne Jackson (Diora Baird), who is assigned to bust the smuggling operation. The narrative crosscuts between their parallel stories, with their paths crossing only briefly at first at a petrol station. Later they have a sitdown in a diner to discuss their antagonism, which suggests writer-director Shane Stanley and co think they’re tipping their hat to Michael Mann’s Heat but with two women instead of Al Pacino and Robert De Niro. Although it’s an interesting idea, sadly the execution is dire, with cliche-riddled dialogue as cheesy as a packet of Kraft Singles, stodgy pacing, poorly developed characters

<p>New breakaway competition is expected to attract massive investment but comes with familiar risks of vulture capitalism</p><p>One of the things I find most amusing about women’s football in England is the absolute level of fume and bristle that arises whenever a contentious refereeing decision occurs. “We need VAR <em>now</em>,” goes the seething howl. To which the only possible response is: guys, maybe be careful what you wish for? And if you set aside the obvious corollary that perhaps people just like being furious, this is a situation that encapsulates the women’s game in this country quite well at the moment. Proud to be different from men’s football. But also, insulted and a bit outraged.</p><p>This is perhaps the central tension in a sport trapped between two competing, almost paradoxical forces: the urge to be a distinctive counterpoint and an alternative space to men’s football, with all its greed and toxicity and rapacious disaster capitalism, and the urge to emulate its

<p>An ancestral Guyanese stew often made at Christmas with a rich herb and spice mix for extra depth</p><p>One of the largest remaining populations of indigenous Amerindian tribes in the English-speaking Caribbean is found in Guyana, where the legacies of the Warrau, Arawak and Carib can be seen to this day. Among the most famous of these is the cultivation and consumption of cassava root, after the Arawak developed a way to turn the prussic acid in cassava juice into a non-poisonous vinegar by cooking it. They called this <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassareep">cassareep</a></em> and, together with local spices and pepper, it forms the basis of Guyanese pepperpot, a slow-cooked, jet-black stew that’s usually reserved for Christmas, when it’s traditionally paired with plait bread. It’s quite different from the pepperpot of other Caribbean islands, or even the African-American version, because the cassareep brings a deep, rich, slightly tangy sweetness to a gently pepper
