  <p id="g8YIRF">Logitech’s Astro gaming brand has a new flagship gaming headset that costs more than some whole-ass consoles, and it’s designed to simultaneously play nice across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X / S, and PC with a single button press.</p>
<p id="zgNt0R">But the $379.99 Astro A50 X doesn’t do all of this with simply plebeian technology like Bluetooth. It uses HDMI passthrough for its expansive connectivity — meaning the beefy charging dock of this headset is designed to be wired up as a central hub for much of your home a

  <p id="JXdS1y">Stellantis announced the all-new 2024 Fiat 500e, a tiny, affordable electric car that could be the perfect antidote to all those <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/14/23960624/truck-suv-hood-height-pedestrian-death-report-iihs">oversized, bloated electric SUVs and trucks</a> that are coming out soon. The tiny EV will be available in North America in early 2024. </p>
<p id="hIaxM4">The Fiat 500e is a great example of the kind of vehicle that makes a lot of sense for cities and maybe even some suburbs. It’s electric, so it won’t spew pollution into the air. It’s small, so it takes up less space and is, on balance, less dangerous to pedestrians, cyclists, and other people who share the road.</p>

  <p id="cccF5x">UK telecoms regulator Ofcom has laid out how porn sites could verify users’ ages under the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/26/23922397/uk-online-safety-bill-law-passed-royal-assent-moderation-regulation">newly passed Online Safety Act</a>. Although the law gives sites the choice of how they keep out underage users, the regulator is publishing a list of measures they’ll be able to use to comply. These include having a bank or mobile network confirm that a user is at least 18 years old (with that user’s consent) or asking a user to supply valid details for a 

## DoorDash makes tipping an afterthought to protest New York City’s wage raise

  <p id="VmiJW3">For most markets where DoorDash operates, customers are prompted to tip on the checkout screen, with a middle option already selected by default. If they want to, they can adjust the tip later from the status screen while awaiting their food, or even after it’s delivered. That’s changing today; while blaming New York City’s minimum wage increase for delivery workers, DoorDash announced that for “select markets, including New York City,” tipping is now exclusively a post-checkout option.</p>
