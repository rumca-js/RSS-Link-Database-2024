Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew is one of the year's best releases as far as I'm concerned, but its arrival was bittersweet, given developer Mimimi Games announced it was shutting up shop shortly after. Since then, the team has wrapped up work on two final DLC drops introducing new characters, islands, and more - but it turns out that wasn't quite everything from the studio: in a surprise final update, Mimimi has now launched an expansive "modding tool" for PC.
</p><p>
Shadow Gambit launched back in August, and saw Mimimi revisiting its beloved stealth tactics genre - which it'd already bought to live with impressive flair in Shadow Tactics and Desperatdos 3 - with an instantly appealing pirate fantasy twist. The result, as I wrote in my <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shadow-gambit-the-cursed-crew-review-old-school-stealth

## Valve's festive treat for "thousands" more DOTA 2 cheaters is a lump of coal and a permanent ban

Valve's making a list, and checking it twice; it's gonna find out who's naughty and nice. And if you happen to be on its Naughty List - which pretty much applies to any one of the "thousands" of DOTA 2 players now identified as being dirty, filthy cheaters - you can expect a cheerfully gift-wrapped lump of toxic coal and a permanent ban in your stocking as your festive treat for 2023.
</p><p>
DOTA 2's annual Frostivus celebrations are now <a href="https://www.dota2.com/frostivus2023">officially underway</a>, meaning everyone on Valve's Nice List - as per its Frostivus 2023 update announcement - can look forward to various festive treats and quality of life improvements. It's less of a jolly holiday for those who've been placed on Valve's Naughty List, however: King Kringle is now doing the rounds with his ban hammer to "pulver

Can you believe it's already been over four hundred years since Elden Ring's Shadow of the Erdtree expansion <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-expansion-confirmed-by-fromsoftware">was announced</a>? And while this year's Game Awards failed to make the interminable wait any easier with a first trailer or some small morsel of news for fans, we might finally have something resembling a potential release window - courtesy of a retailer leak, by way of an official Bandai Namco partner, pointing to a February 2024 launch for the DLC.

As spotted <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/18ivr60/a_page_for_elden_ring_x_thrustmaster_collab/">over on Reddit</a>, details of a new Elden Ring collaboration between publisher Bandai Namco and peripheral manufacturer Thrustmaster -

Trust was a key reason <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bayonetta-creator-hideki-kamiya-leaving-platinumgames">Hideki Kamiya left Platinum Games</a> earlier this year.

</p><p>
In a new interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hideki-kamiya-on-why-he-left-platinumgames-his-youtube-channel-and-his-next-game">IGN</a>, the Bayonetta creator discussed his reasoning for leaving the developer.

</p><p>
"My work with PlatinumGames was based on a relationship of trust with the company," he said. "I decided to leave because I felt that the direction the company was heading in was different from my beliefs as a developer. Without that element of trust, I couldn't continue working there, and so I left, so that I could continue working in what I consider to be the right way."

Baldur's Gate 3 will not be coming to Game Pass, even now the game is available on Xbox.

Speaking with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-isnt-going-to-be-on-game-pass-insists-larian-boss">IGN</a>, Larian Studios founder Swen Vincke stated the award winning RPG won't appear on Microsoft's subscription service, and that has always been the plan. 
</p><p>
"We made a big game, so I think there's a fair price to be paid for that, and I think that that is okay," Vincke said, adding Baldur's Gate 3's inclusion on Game Pass was a "sensitive question".

Toby Fox has remixed Ed Sheeran's song Celestial in the Pok&eacute;mon Scarlet and Violet DLC The Indigo Disk.
</p><p>
Celestial featured in the credits of the base game, while Toby Fox - known as the creator of Undertale - composed music for the soundtrack, specifically the raid battle theme among others.
</p><p>
The remix is a stripped back, string-heavy affair that chops up the vocal lines - it's a pleasant change from the original.

Arkane Lyon has shared new concept art for its upcoming video game, Marvel's Blade.
</p><p>The artwork gives our first glimpse of the game's vampire enemies.</p><p>
It looks incredibly good, and hopefully this will carry over into the game's release. For want of a better word, it looks really, really cool, and has echoes of the studio's previous works Deathloop and Dishonored (at this point, it is worth noting that Arkane's previous vampire game Redfall was primarily helmed by its Austin department).

Nintendo has issued a takedown notice for the unofficial Link's Awakening's PC port, which started making the rounds earlier this week.
</p><p>
The port, known as Link's Awakening DX HD, was a rather gorgeous remake of the classic Zelda GameBoy title. It featured HD visuals, 120fps scrolling and widescreen support. 
</p><p>
As noted by Digital Foundry's John Linneman, it also allowed players to zoom out and take in the entirety of Koholint Island at once.

Here are quick-fire reviews of four favourites that I've tested over the past month, from two extremely good value options with both niche and mass-market appeal (the trendy Nuphy Air75 v2 and odd Gamakay LK75) to two of the most customisable and expensive keyboards I've ever tested (the fancy Drop CSTM80 and the godlike Mode Sonnet). </p><p>Beyond the usual key feel impressisons and longevity stats cited by mechanical keyboard enthusiasts, the strength of this category is that there is just so much you can do to tweak and customise every aspect of your keyboard, from keycaps and switches to more subtle elements like plates, weights, foam and cases. This quartet demonstrates that flexibility ably, and while certain trendy features like gasket-mounted sw

Hello! It's our last Game of the Week of 2023 - next week we'll be on to end-of-the-year stuff - and what an incredible week to end things on.

Creative Assembly has apologised for "missteps" it made with the Total War series and is offering partial refunds of Total War: Pharaoh on Steam.
</p><p>
The Shadows of Change DLC for Total War: Warhammer 3 was poorly received by players when it released in August, with mostly negative reviews on Steam posted ever since. Total War: Pharaoh, meanwhile, was criticised for its high price and lack of content.
</p><p>
"We again apologise for the missteps we've made," reads a <a href="https://www.totalwar.com/blog/message-from-total-war-leadership-dec-2023/">new blog post from Creative Assembly</a> vice president Roger Collum. "The mistakes of Total War are a shared responsibility by all the leaders of the franchise, and while it may not seem like it at times, we are listening."

Following reports that development on Naughty Dog's long-awaited The Last of Us multiplayer game had been "slowed down" earlier this year, the studio has announced it's officially pulling the plug on the project, saying it didn't want to become a "solely live service games studio".
</p><p>
Naughty Dog's multiplayer game was initially planned to be part of The Last of Us Part 2, but the studio announced it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naughty-dog-confirms-the-last-of-us-2-wont-have-multiplayer-after-all">separating the two halves</a> in 2019.
