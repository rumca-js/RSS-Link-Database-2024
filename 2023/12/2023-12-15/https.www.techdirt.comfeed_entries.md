The Italians are the new Israelis&#8230; at least in terms of hawking phone exploits and other spyware. NSO Group crashed hard following leaks showing its customers (many of which were, shall we say, questionable) were targeting political rivals, dissidents, human rights activists, journalists, lawyers, and religious leaders with powerful exploits that completely exposed the contents [&#8230;]

It seems like the only “bipartisan” support around regulations and the internet these days is… over the false, widely debunked moral panic that the internet is inherently harmful to children.

We just got done noting how 2023 was finally the year that streaming fully surpassed traditional TV in terms of overall paying subscribers.

I will admit, after my last post on Russian game developer Fntastic shutting down operations days after the release of the much-hyped The Day After, I really thought it would be my last post on the this whole fiasco.
