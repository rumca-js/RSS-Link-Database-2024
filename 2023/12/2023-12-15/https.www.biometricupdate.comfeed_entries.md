		Computer vision vendors and researchers are developing significantly upgraded camera systems on the front end of AI, including biometric recognition software.

Two companies, <a href="https://www.orbbec.com/">Orbbec</a> and <a href="https://www.silc.com/">SiLC</a> separately say they have developed integrated camera-compute components with notably better capabilities that would aid biometrics systems.

Separately, researchers at Purdue University <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41566-023-01232-x">published</a> work on exotic computer vision technology that also would benefit biometric and object recognition algorithms.

Indeed, the Purdue team tested their hardware on facial recognition tasks. They call their hardware an organic electrochemical photonic sy

		In the U.S., digital IDs are expected to help streamline traffic during airlines' busiest season, and the New Terminal One is now testing SITA biometrics systems for its preproduction phase at the JFK airport.
<h2>Digital IDs in US airports expected to reduce check-in time</h2>
By using California's mDLs as forms of identification TSA PreCheck lines in major airports, travelers can expedite their check-in process, according to <a href="https://sfstandard.com/2023/12/14/california-dmv-digital-drivers-licenses-airport-sfo/">The San Francisco Standard.</a> The digital IDs are currently valid at three international airports in the state – SFO, LAX, and SJC – as part of a pilot program.

SFO anticipates seeing roughly 2.25 million travelers between today and the e

		More than half of students and parents in the U.S. are concerned about using cameras with facial recognition to check people entering a school building, according to a new <a href="https://cdt.org/insights/what-was-once-science-fiction-is-now-reality-orwellian-uses-of-safety-tech-in-k-12-schools/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">survey</a> published this week by the Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT).

Despite these results, the Washington, D.C.-headquartered non-profit organization says that the technology is being deployed in a growing number of K-12 schools. While 55 percent of students and 58 percent of parents have expressed worry over facial recognition, 33 percent of teachers say their school or school di

		The University of Maryland Eastern Shore (UMES) is setting up a research project and classes to analyze data about how law enforcement agencies across the state use facial recognition with funding from a new grant.

The $327,000 grant reported by local ABC affiliate <a href="https://www.wmdt.com/2023/12/umes-granted-327k-to-study-facial-recognition-bias/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">WMDT</a> is from the Maryland Governor's Office of Crime Control and Prevention and earmarked for "Facial Recognition and AI Tools in Criminal Justice -- Building Accountability and Trust," UMES Associate Professor Lily Chi-Fang Tsai told <em>Biometric Update </em>in an email. Tsai is co-principal investigator on the project, along with Dr. Sandeep Gopalan.

		A bill that would require Canadians to verify their age online before accessing pornography has advanced another step on its journey through the country’s House of Commons on Wednesday.

The <a href="https://www.parl.ca/legisinfo/en/bill/44-1/s-210">S-210</a> Bill, also known as the Protecting Young Persons from Exposure to Pornography Act, passed the Senate in the spring. The law mandates adult websites to verify users’ ages but does not specify how.

Options could include a digital ID system or facial scans coupled with age estimation technology. In September, the Digital Governance Standards Institute (DGSI) of Canada <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202309/canadian-digital-standards-org-wants-porn-bill-to-go-harder-on-biometric-age-verificati

		Over the past years, governments from across the globe have begun to measure and improve artificial intelligence systems by building AI governance tools. Organizations such as the <a href="https://www.worldprivacyforum.org/">World Privacy Forum</a> (WPF) say that now is the time to establish evaluation for these tools and are calling for organizations such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and OECD to take the lead.

In a report published on Friday, the non-profit public interest research group argues that setting up international standards, such as quality assurance, can help evaluate AI governance more transparently. The group urged NIST to develop recommendations for creating, evaluating, and using AI governance tools.

The OECD, on the oth

		United Kingdom identity and access management firm Xalient has purchased a European digital ID service firm in a deal that might say as much about the players as the market.

<a href="https://xalient.com/">Xalient</a> did not release financial details about its buyout of <a href="https://www.grabowsky.com/en/">Grabowsky</a>. The company's last acquisition was only four months ago, when it bought another identity services company, U.S.-based <a href="https://www.integralpartnersllc.com/">Integral Partners</a>.

Based on the two buyouts, Xalient wants a quick expansion of its presence in markets to its west and east. The company says it now has 300 employees.

Absorbing services firms is a good way for a custom software company to bring in new qualified buyers. In this case
