Movies like Dumb and Dumber, The Mask, and Ace Ventura put Jim Carrey on the map for most of the world.  But his turn in Liar Liar, proved that Jim Carrey was capable of both off the wall slapstick comedy, and a much more dramatic tone.  Liar Liar paved the way for Jim Carrey to land roles in films like The Truman Show and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.  Without Liar Liar, the world may have never seen Jim Carrey's full range as an actor. \n\n#jimcarrey #liarliar #aceventura #nerdstalgic \n\nSOURCES\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/1997/03/21/movies/the-truth-shall-set-you-free-not.html\nhttps://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/liar-liar-1997", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQ2poVNUqOQ", "date_published": "2023-12-15T18:00:31+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "Nerdstalgic", "album": "Nerdstalgic", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/gQ2poVNUqOQ/hqdefault.jpg", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 52, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 2, "page_rating": 52, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}]
