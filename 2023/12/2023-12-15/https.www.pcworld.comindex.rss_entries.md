<p>If you&rsquo;ve spent any time on a desktop &ldquo;battlestation&rdquo; forum, you know the Edifier R1280T, by sight if not by name. It&rsquo;s the go-to pick for high-quality bookshelf speakers on a budget, a mainstay of excessive desk setups across the internet and the real world. Including <em>my </em>excessive desk setup, where these bad boys have been a mainstay for over five years. A good deal at the standard price of $120, <a href="http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=14154&amp;GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B016P9HJIA/?th=1&amp;ascsubtag=2-3-1989142-1-0-0" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">the R1280T set is just $84 today</a>, which matches the low price for Amazon Prime Day this summer. </p>

<p>You can never have too much memory, in the same sense that you can never have too much toilet paper. If this philosophy appeals to you, you might want to check out the latest news from manufacturer MSI. The company announced that it&rsquo;s enabling support for up to 256GB of DDR5 RAM on at least some of its consumer-grade motherboards, assuming the hardware can handle it and has the standard four memory module slots. If you don&rsquo;t have a pocket calculator handy, that means a whopping 64GB on each individual DIMM. 2-slot boards will go up to 128GB. </p>



<p>The announcement comes in the form of <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.msi.com/news/detail/MSI-Motherboards-Unleash-Extreme-Power-with-Memory-Capacity-Boosted-To-256GB---142879&amp;xcust=2-3-2173466-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow"
