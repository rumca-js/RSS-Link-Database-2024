New research has revealed that Rembrandt impregnated the canvas for his famous 1642 militia painting "The Night Watch" with a lead-containing substance even before applying the first ground layer. Such lead-based impregnation has never before been observed with Rembrandt or his contemporaries. The discovery, published today in Science Advances, underlines Rembrandt's inventive way of working, in which he did not shy away from using new techniques.

Christmas Dinners are one of the UK's most cherished traditions, and Christmas menus have evolved greatly over the years. Today, turkey is the typical meat of choice; going back 500 years, it was beef, venison, and wild boar in Henry VIII's festive feasts. Looking to the future, researchers at the University of Warwick think that lab-grown meat, or cultivated meat, might end up being the centerpiece on our Christmas tables.

## Researchers turn a small photonic chip into a functional temperature sensor

Similar to electronics, photonic circuits can be miniaturized onto a chip, leading to a so-called photonic integrated circuit (PIC). Although these developments are more recent than for electronics, this field is rapidly evolving. One of the main issues, however, is to turn such a PIC into a functional device. This requires optical packaging and coupling strategies to bring light into and get light out of the PIC.

When two lead ions collide at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), they produce an extremely hot and dense state of matter in which quarks and gluons are not confined inside composite particles called hadrons. This fireball of particles—known as quark–gluon plasma and believed to have filled the universe in the first few millionths of a second after the Big Bang—expands and cools down rapidly. The quarks and gluons then transform back into hadrons, which fly out of the collision zone towards particle detectors.

Communicating between species isn't something that only has to take place between space-faring civilizations. There are plenty of species here on our home planet that communicate using a variety of sights, sounds, and smells. We're only starting to unlock the secrets of how to understand and respond to these types of foreign languages. Researchers at the SETI Institute think that doing so might be a good test for whether we'll be able to communicate with extraterrestrials if we ever get the chance to.

In the more than sixty years that have since passed, astronomers have conducted multiple surveys in search of technological activity (aka technosignatures). To date, Breakthrough Listen is the most ambitious SETI experiment, combining data from the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope, the Parkes Murriyang Telescope, the Automated Planet Finder, and the MeerKAT Radio Telescope and advanced analytics.

The word "virus" is often associated with negative connotations. However, it is important to note that not all viruses are harmful. In fact, there are many viruses that live inside our bodies and play important roles in our health. One example is bacteriophages, viruses that infect bacteria and can be used to keep bacterial infections under control.

Human sex chromosomes originated from a pair of autosomes, the ordinary or non-sex chromosomes that contain the majority of our genome and come in identical pairs. That ancestral pair of autosomes diverged to become two different chromosomes, X and Y. Even though X and Y have grown apart from each other and taken on unique functions—namely, determining sex and driving sex differences in males and females—they also retain shared functions inherited from their common ancestor.

Compound leaves, which are composed of multiple independent units called leaflets, show a wide diversity of patterning, ranging from trifoliolate, palmate, pinnate to higher ordered forms. There is agreement that the proximodistal expression patterns of morphogenetic regulators are associated with the compound leaf patterning. However, the mechanisms by which such patterns are established, maintained, and regulated, as well as their functional relationships to the sequential progression of leaflet formation are largely unknown.

Child psychologists have long known that play is essential for children's cognitive development because it boosts their social, physical, and emotional skills. But beginning in the 21st century, specialists repeatedly sounded the alarm that 'play is under siege' for US children. Kids were playing less, and—it was feared—with a lesser quality.
