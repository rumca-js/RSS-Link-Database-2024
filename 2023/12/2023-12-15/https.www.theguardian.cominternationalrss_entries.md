<p>The 26-year-old left back is flying the American flag higher than anyone else at Craven Cottage – and possibly higher than anyone else in European soccer too</p><p>Others might appear on the Mount Rushmore of current US men’s national team icons before Antonee Robinson. Indeed, Christian Pulisic, Gio Reyna, Weston McKennie and Yunus Musah might all get a mention for their European exploits ahead of Robinson, but the Fulham left back is out-performing them all right now.</p><p>Mohamed Salah knows how well Robinson is currently playing. Callum Hudson-Odoi and Jarrod Bowen too. They have all come up against the American for a resurgent Fulham team recently and struggled to make an impact. Robinson – nicknamed ‘Jedi’ from childhood – stopped them. The force is strong with him at this moment in time.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/dec/15/antonee-robinson-fulham-usa-profile">Continue reading...</a>

A few years later, when the farmer she’d become friends with asked for help selling his tea in the US, Purvis decided to start a business. But she quickly realized how little she knew about business in general, let alone how to import tea, meet Food and Drug Administration regulations, and create sell sheets for retailers. “I never cried so much as I did that first year,” Purvis, 33, says. “The sheer learning curve was extremely overwhelming.

There were just two problems with this purchase: the game is a text-heavy role-playing adventure with no English translation, and I don’t own a PC Engine, a cult 16 bit machine first released in Japan in 1987, which hosted some of the finest arcade conversions of the era in then-astounding visual quality.

<p>From a Finnish archipelago to a tranquil lake in Albania, our tipsters have unearthed beautiful beaches, lively cities and wild, atmospheric places</p><p>Fans of Finnish author <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/tove-jansson">Tove Jansson</a> will love the idyllic Pellinki archipelago, where she spent her summers on a tiny island, Klovharun, described in several of her novels. About 50 miles east of Helsinki, <a href="https://visitpellinge.fi/en/">Pellinki</a> forms part of a group of islands, linked by bridges and a delightful ferry, which you can explore by boat, car, bicycle, bus or on foot. Walk through the woods to reach one of the quiet beaches, hire a boat to fish or just tootle around the beautiful bays and stay in a traditional, wooden cottage with a matching sauna set among the trees where the only sounds you’ll hear are birdsong and the gentle putter of a small boat passing by. Finnish people know a lot about the importance of connecting with nature and this is

<p>Weirdly forgettable action caper sees the star’s glossy American family dream  interrupted by his glossy former life in covert ops</p><p>Once again demonstrating his stolid competence in playing both straight action or comedy, Mark Wahlberg is the action-comedy lead with amazing abs in this glossy but weirdly forgettable tranche of content; it is directed by the estimable Simon Cellan Jones, known for more heartfelt work including BBC TV’s Our Friends in the North.</p><p>Used car salesman Dan (Wahlberg) is living the American dream as a family man in the ’burbs with wonderful wife Jessica (played by the excellent but somehow underused Michelle Monaghan) and three kids: two teens and a late-blessing baby, whose existence testifies to Dan and Jessica’s continuing loved-up bliss. But Dan has a secret: he is of course a former special forces warrior in a mercenary crew covertly used by the US government for deniable operations.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/dec/15

<p>By the look of her scraggly hair and dirty dress, she’s been waiting years for some attention. But no matter: this fairy needs to fly</p><p>One year when I was very little, my mum hand-sewed a beaded cream dress with a taffeta skirt for a plastic doll I owned, to turn her from my toy into the Christmas-tree fairy. The doll was a younger, sweeter version of a Barbie, with round blue eyes and painted pink lips. I never played with her and I suspect it was Mum’s way of recycling, finding a purpose for it.</p><p>The doll was much too heavy really to adorn the top point on a Christmas tree, weighing it down and often ending up facing the ground instead of looking over us the way a fairy should. But we all loved her, and my brother and I would take it in turns each year to climb up a parent and place the fairy on top of the tree. She began life with long straw-like hair that I brushed sometimes, but around the time she made her first fairy appearance, I gave her a haircut, trimming thos
