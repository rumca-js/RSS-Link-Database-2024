Unfortunately for the handheld hybrid follow-up, it will likely not be able to run GTA 6\u2014at least not well. And that makes it unlikely that the Switch 2 will get GTA 6 at all. Blame all the fancy flourishes in the game, specifically ray-tracing, which is something the Switch 2 hardware will likely struggle with, considering it will be based on a mobile chipset. In other news, concept art for Arkane's Blade game have been released, and it looks to be more stylish and \"comic book-like\" than their other games like Dishonered and Deathloop. Interestingly, no specific platforms have been announced. And speaking of platforms, Microsoft has continued to discount the Xbox Series X for the holidays. A brand new unit will cost around $399 USD, which is $100 less than its usual price.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5nyWVrK_-w", "date_published": "2023-12-15T00:49:10+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "Ign - YouTube", "album": "Ign - YouTube", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/w5nyWVrK_-w/hqdefault.jpg", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "title": "Miller's Girl - Official Trailer (2024) Jenna Ortega, Martin Freeman", "description": "A talented young writer (Jenna Ortega) embarks on a creative odyssey when her teacher (Martin Freeman) assigns a project that entangles them both in an increasingly complex web.
