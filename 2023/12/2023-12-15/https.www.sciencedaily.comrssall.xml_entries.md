A team of astronomers has used asteroseismology, or the study of stellar oscillations, to accurately measure the distance of stars from the Earth. Their research examined thousands of stars and checked the measurements taken during the Gaia mission to study the near Universe.

A new systematic review furthers our understanding of the amount of potentially harmful chemicals in menstrual-related products. Endocrine-disrupting chemicals can interfere with human hormones and cause medical issues.

## Study shows exposure to household chemicals can lower odds of getting pregnant

Exposure to phthalates, a group of plasticizing and solvent chemicals found in many household products, was linked to a lower probability of getting pregnant, but not to pregnancy loss, according to research by environmental and reproductive epidemiologists.

## Revolutionary seaweed and carbonated water based hydrogel for treating skin wounds
 - [https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2023/12/231215140054.htm](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2023/12/231215140054.htm)

Hydrogels have demonstrated promise for effectively treating skin wounds. However, currently available hydrogels adhere to the skin and swell when absorbing fluid discharge, causing the wound site to expand during the initial stages of recovery. Now, researchers have developed a novel type of hydrogel using a biocompatible substance found in seaweed. This hydrogel results in lower adhesion and swelling, but provides a high therapeutic effect, promising recovery without wound expansion.

## Researchers discover first ever link between hemoglobin-like protein and normal heart development
 - [https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2023/12/231215134604.htm](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2023/12/231215134604.htm)

Researchers have discovered that a certain kind of protein similar to hemoglobin, called cytoglobin, plays an important role in the development of the heart. Specifically, it affects the correct left-right pattern of the heart and other asymmetric organs. The findings could eventually lead to the development of new therapeutic interventions to alter the processes that lead to these defects.

## New red galaxies turn out to be already known blue galaxies

Not all discoveries turn out to be actual new discoveries. This was the case for the extremely red objects (EROs) found in James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) data. Analysis shows that they are very similar to blue-excess dust obscured galaxies (BluDOGs) already reported in Subaru Telescope data.

## 'Long flu' has emerged as a consequence similar to long COVID
 - [https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2023/12/231215015511.htm](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2023/12/231215015511.htm)

New research comparing the viruses that cause the flu and COVID-19 shows that people hospitalized with seasonal influenza also can suffer long-term, negative health effects, especially involving their lungs and airways. The study also found that in the 18 months after infection, patients hospitalized for either COVID-19 or seasonal influenza faced an increased risk of death, hospital readmission, and other health problems.

## Morocco earthquake had unusual deep slip, according to new modeling

In their rapid characterization of the magnitude 6.8 Al Haouz earthquake in Morocco, researchers suggest that the earthquake ruptured roughly 25 kilometers deep beneath the surface.

## Researchers, Coast Salish people analyze 160-year-old indigenous dog pelt in the Smithsonian's collection

A new analysis sheds light on the ancestry and genetics of woolly dogs, a now extinct breed of dog that was a fixture of Indigenous Coast Salish communities in the Pacific Northwest for millennia. Anthropologists and biologists analyzed genetic clues preserved in the pelt of 'Mutton,' the only known woolly dog fleece in the world, to pinpoint the genes responsible for their highly sought-after woolly fur. The study's findings include interviews contributed by several Coast Salish co-authors, including Elders, Knowledge Keepers and Master Weavers, who provided crucial context about the role woolly dogs played in Coast Salish society.

## Ancient DNA reveals how a chicken virus evolved to become more deadly

An international team of scientists led by geneticists and disease biologists has used ancient DNA to trace the evolution of Marek's Disease Virus (MDV). This global pathogen causes fatal infections in unvaccinated chickens and costs the poultry industry over $1 billion per year. The findings show how viruses evolve to become more virulent and could lead to the development of better ways to treat viral infections.
