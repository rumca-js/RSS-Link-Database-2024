But, if you are one of the people in the climate death cult, then you don’t know that. </p><p>PG&amp;E is not only one of the very ignorant entities who think the government can turn hail into rain by taxing you more. But their ignorance goes beyond all that. Their ignorance has turned into arrogance. Because they want to increase rates and the excuse they are using is………. yepers, you guessed it…. climate change. *Gas

So just go with it. </p><p>Now, Karen did not realize when you move right next to a BBQ joint, you will not only end up with great meat all the time, but you will also smell the yummy food.

	It is astounding that the White House is still trying to make Bidenomics happen. Not that I have high standards for White House messaging. It's hard enough for them to keep Joe Biden coherent, standing upright, or remembering to go poopie on the potty. But the blinders they have for Bidenomics as a talking point, despite ALL evidence, need to be marveled at and studied.
</p><p>
	Here is Karine Jean-Pierre, the least competent of Biden's diversity hires, attempting once again to convince Americans that Bidenomics has ackshually been good for them. Trust the science!

	I mean data.
