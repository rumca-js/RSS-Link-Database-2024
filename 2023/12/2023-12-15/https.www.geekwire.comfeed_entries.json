The Seattle business leaders recently announced the Ackerley Sports Group (ASG), a new arm of their longtime investment firm Ackerley Partners.

And this year they became owners and partners of Leeds United Football Club, a top English soccer franchise that recently shifted majority ownership to 49ers Enterprises, which owns the NFL&#8217;s San Francisco 49ers.&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2023/ackerley-brothers-fresh-off-leeds-united-stake-launch-new-investment-arm-for-sports-and-tech/\">Read More</a>", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2023/ackerley-brothers-fresh-off-leeds-united-stake-launch-new-investment-arm-for-sports-and-tech", "date_published": "2023-12-15T20:59:04+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "GeekWire", "album": "GeekWire", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://www.geekwire.com/wp-content/themes/geekwire/dist/images/geekwire-logo-rss.png", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed/", "title": "Glowforge lays off 30 employees as maker of 3D laser engravers gets \u2018ready for what\u2019s next\u2019", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"946\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/danshapiro-1260x946.jpeg\" width=\"1260\" /><br />Glowforge, the Seattle-based maker of 3D laser engravers, has laid off 30 employees, co-founder and CEO Dan Shapiro confirmed to GeekWire on Friday. &#8220;We&#8217;ve had to make some tough calls about parting ways with amazing people,&#8221; Shapiro said in an emailed statement. &#8220;They&#8217;ve helped us accomplish incredible things.
