We were joined by accessibility journalist Grant Stoner, who reviewed Sony’s PlayStation Access adaptive controller for IGN. While the controller is a major improvement over what was previously available (nothing) and it’s allowed Grant to get lost in some awesome PS5 games like Spider-Man 2 and God of War Ragnarok, it has some questionable design choices that Grant points out. We also discuss some of the games that made major pushes for accessibility in 2023, and why “unnecessary” remakes of more recent games are often huge wins for players with disabilities thanks to added features that a lot of folks might not even notice.

Lego Fortnite reviewed on PC by Phil Hornshaw. Also available on PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.
Lego Fortnite is a great entry point into survival games thanks to its cooperative focus (either with friends or helpful NPCs) and its easygoing approach when compared to other, more hardcore games in the genre. The recognizably repetitive grind of climbing the tech tree and growing your village can be quite fun, but right now it feels more like a foundation than a full-fledged game. What's here shows potential, especially with all the possibilities afforded by Lego's construction elements and the idea of custom-made vehicles, but more needs to be added before Lego Fortnite feels like a full set.

IGN's Max Scoville and Cheez-It's very own Cheez play through the pizza-making sidequest in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. Did you know Hyrule-style pizza is actually pretty similar to Chicago-style, so its a pretty polarizing topic for food lovers. I'm still not sure where Jeffrey went, we haven't heard from him in days. And now Max took his place, but he's like... WAY taller, so maybe that has something to do with it? More wingspan reach to grab onto delicious cheesy baked snack crackers? Hold on...

I THINK I'VE FIGURED IT OUT! Our IGN talent seems to be participating in some sort of ritual. Playing through some of the years biggest games. How is Cheez involved? I'm still working on theories, but it also appears that there are additional videos with more appearances from Brian Altano, Jeffrey Vega, and Max Scoville on social platforms. Maybe those are the key to freeing them from the Backrooms? Perhaps this has been their destiny from the beginning. Max represents the

Rebel Moon – Part One: A Child of Fire, reviewed by Hanna Ines Flint. Narrated by Max Scoville.

Despite a great ensemble cast, Zack Snyder's space opera is let down by a derivative patchwork script, mediocre action sequences and a superficial story that fails to live up to its expansive promise.

Considering 2023 was a year that saw some real lows for the movie industry – specifically the near-complete shutdown of Hollywood for months due to the writers and actors strikes – it also had some moments of genuine affirmation for fans of the cinema who have been fearing that the good old act of going to the movies may be on its way out. From Five Nights at Freddy’s to Taylor Swift’s music doc of her Eras Tour to two of our nominees for Best Movie of 2023, Barbie and Oppenheimer, there wound up being some legit “you gotta see these movies at the movies” moments this year. But what was the Best Movie of 2023?

It’s always a tricky thing picking our Best Movie nominees for the IGN Awards each year, because while we are aware of, and in some cases adore, the more hoity-toity arthouse fare that critics groups may go for during the inevitable EOY awards rush, we are also lovers of movies of all kinds – superhero movies, horror movies, sci-fi movies, and perhaps best of all… Keanu Reeves

In today's Daily Fix:
The tech wizards at Digital Foundry have been comparing the tech seen in the Grand Theft Auto 6 trailer to what will likely be powering the Nintendo Switch 2. Unfortunately for the handheld hybrid follow-up, it will likely not be able to run GTA 6—at least not well. And that makes it unlikely that the Switch 2 will get GTA 6 at all. Blame all the fancy flourishes in the game, specifically ray-tracing, which is something the Switch 2 hardware will likely struggle with, considering it will be based on a mobile chipset. In other news, concept art for Arkane's Blade game have been released, and it looks to be more stylish and "comic book-like" than their other games like Dishonered and Deathloop. Interestingly, no specific platforms have been announced. And speaking of platforms, Microsoft has continued to discount the Xbox Series X for the holidays. A brand new unit will cost around $399 USD, which is $100 less than its usual price.
