<p>After Dejan Kulusevski thumped in Tottenham’s second goal, the killer blow for Nottingham Forest, Steve Cooper swivelled on his feet, dragged his fingers down his cheeks and retreated towards the home dugout. Quite how many more times he will be able to call this place home depends on how dimly the Forest owner, Evangelos Marinakis, views this latest defeat, a fifth in the past six matches. By the time a reinvigorated Bournemouth depart the City Ground on 23 December Forest could, if results do not go their way, find themselves in the relegation zone.</p><p>Forest have won one of their past 13 matches and Cooper is on increasingly rocky terrain. Spurs may have finished this game with 10 men, Yves Bissouma seeing red for a crude takedown of Ryan Yates with 20 minutes of normal time to play, but goals from Richarlison and Kulusevski ensured successive victories for Ange Postecoglou’s side. The last time Richarlison managed back-to-back league goals, his manager was Frank Lampard and

Actor who brought the intensity and control of his stage training to the small screen, notably in Brooklyn Nine-Nine and Homicide: Life on the Street<p>The career of the actor Andre Braugher, who has died of lung cancer aged 61, was benchmarked by two performances in police dramas a generation apart. In the groundbreaking drama Homicide: Life on the Street, from 1993 until 1999, he played Detective Frank Pembleton, whose drive immediately made him the anchor of an impressive ensemble cast led by Yaphet Kotto and Ned Beatty. He drew a younger audience with the comedy Brooklyn Nine-Nine (2013-21) as Captain Ray Holt, who takes over a chaotic homicide squad and whose intensity again makes him the heart of the show.</p><p>Braugher’s deep, resonant voice and seemingly effortless control drew the respect of all he worked with. David Simon, creator of Homicide and The Wire, said: “I’ve worked with a lot of wonderful actors. I’ll never work with one better.” His classical training, at the Ju

<p>The American novelist has created an oeuvre of medieval gross-fests, 60s psychological thrillers and hallucinatory evocations over five novels and one short story collection</p><p>Ottessa Moshfegh likes her characters degraded. They live intensely and feel deeply, fuelled by shame, lust, alcohol, overactive imaginations and, occasionally, laxatives. Over the last 10 years, the American novelist has published five novels and one collection of short stories. At first they might not seem that cohesive, spanning medieval gross-fests and 60s psychological thrillers, but Moshfegh is remarkably consistent. She writes about lonely people who might disgust us, but who also invite us to reconsider the line between what makes a life ordinary or exceptional.

<p>The director’s attempt to replicate Star Wars for smartphones is an ugly, unforgivably dull and self-serious mess</p><p>Zack Snyder pitched Rebel Moon as a marriage of Seven Samurai and Star Wars, which is a bit like trying to sell your new invention as the wheel meets sliced bread. The former channeled all of Akira Kurosawa’s estimable powers in blocking, lighting and composition for battles that still merit the nearly-exhausted descriptor of “epic”; the latter was a once-in-a-millennium Big Bang of raw movie stardom, snappy dialogue and transportive production design that turned a mid-budget space oddity into a culture-straddling phenomenon; both are fundamentally irreplicable. And so Lucasfilm passed on Snyder’s tall order, as did Warner Bros. (more than once), until the good people at Netflix uncinched their readily loosened purse strings for what had gradually become the blockbuster king’s longest-simmering passion project.</p><p>Yet the finished product has only the vaguest

<p>The former Clarets manager revolutionised the team mentality and the dressing room tunes during his decade at Turf Moor</p><p>It should have been the worst day of the year, one every player would be forgiven for wanting to avoid, but “gaffer’s day” at Burnley was integral to what Sean Dyche built. The manager would give his coaches the day off, leave footballs at home and disregard modern technology, except a stopwatch and whistle, before putting his squad through nigh-on depraved acts of running, all in the name of team bonding and, to a lesser extent, fitness.</p><p>Dyche returns to Turf Moor on Saturday night with Everton for the first time since being sacked in April 2022. His decade at Burnley was an overall triumph of two promotions and seven seasons in the Premier League and even a brief venture into Europe. He took great enjoyment in making his players suffer on his special day in pre-season, getting them to run until they could no more as part of his legacy.</p> <a href="

Of course you will: you’re Rafa Benítez.</p><p>“This is a good day to introduce someone because the man being introduced doesn’t need anyone to introduce him,” Mouriño had said. “His curriculum, his history, his teams, his successes, his triumphs, his championships, speak for themselves.

<p>The blockbuster film-maker turned the horrors of the second world war into an Oscar-winning drama that is a public service</p><p>A cynic might say that in making Schindler’s List, a film about an opportunistic businessman who used his factory to shelter Polish Jews from extermination in the second world war, Steven Spielberg, that undisputed master of commercial uplift, has somehow managed to find the silver lining in the darkest cloud of the 20th century. And the cynic would be right to a point: Spielberg does seek to eke out whatever humanity he can find from this scenario, even if that humanity is suppressed by arrogance and self-loathing.</p><p>But don’t miss how dark he makes the cloud. Thirty years later, it remains astonishing how Spielberg, perhaps the only film-maker Hollywood would ever agree to bankroll for a film about the Holocaust, sought to depict both grand and casual atrocities with unblinking directness, muted only slightly by Janusz Kamiński’s black-and-white ph

<p>How to add a sweet touch to your Christmas wine list without breaking the bank</p><p>You might think there was enough sweet stuff on the menu over the holiday period without adding dessert wines to the mix, but apparently not. Christmas is the one time of year when retailers, almost certainly responding to consumer demand, tend to have a good selection: fortified wines such as port and sherry, obviously, but also lighter dessert wines that, despite recent price increases, can still be remarkable value for money.</p><p>So when and with what should you drink them? In fact, it’s almost easier to point out what doesn’t work. Lighter wines such as sauternes or their less expensive equivalents (see below) aren’t great with classic festive desserts such as Christmas pudding or a bûche de Noël, and work much better with lighter, fruitier, more citrusy desserts. Port, meanwhile, tends to be too strong even for mince pies, so save that for the stilton. And with some dessert wines, such as u

Now that its 12th series will be the last, it’s time to celebrate its genius</p><p>It has been said that you can tell a lot about a person by the theme tune they hear in their head whenever you play them the HBO intro. For many, it’s the courtly pomp of the Game of Thrones opening credits. For others, it’ll be the swampy bass of The Sopranos theme, or maybe the weird gargling of The White Lotus. For me, it has always been three ascending tuba burps that start the Curb Your Enthusiasm theme tune. This is because, as everyone knows, Curb Your Enthusiasm is the best show that HBO has ever made.</p><p>But get ready to not hear that tuba for much longer, because Larry David has just announced <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/dec/15/curb-your-enthusiasm-final-season-12-tv-hbo-ending-larry-david-comedy-to-end">that the upcoming 12th season of Curb Your Enthusiasm wil

She started life in a colony of strays who inhabited the basement of a derelict tenement midway between Curry Row and student central in the West End of Glasgow. She was weaned on the leftovers from takeaway containers thrown drunkenly into the basement area late at night. I know this because I was familiar with the colony of Jellicle cats and walked past it on my way home from work. That was where she picked me up. She was obviously one of them, not least because of her penchant for curry.</p><p>One winter evening, as I passed the cat tenement, I sensed I was being followed. I looked around, saw no one and continued on my way. When I opened the door to my tenement close, a black and white streak shot past me.

It felt like it was almost worth dying just to get the party started. Almost. It almost made me feel that I needed to revisit my own plans and up my game. A couple of years ago, I wrote here that I would like the Webb Sisters to sing Leonard Cohen’s If It Be Your Will and for Ermonela Jaho or Lisette Oropesa to sing Richard Strauss’s Morgen!.

<p>Many people want to enjoy the festivities without drinking – but come up against relentless pressure. Here is how to resist temptation</p><p>December is synonymous with booze: mulled wine and carols, cocktails with friends. On <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/christmas">Christmas</a> morning, there’s buck’s fizz to herald a whole 24 hours – or not, depending on which point of the day you fall asleep on the sofa – of solid eating and drinking. Then you get up the next day and do it all again with whatever’s left in the fridge and the drinks cabinet, occasionally dragging yourself to visit nearby relatives, where you will probably once again be plied with booze. Ho, ho, ho, etc.</p><p>If the thought of this fills you with festive cheer, glug on. But if you’re dreading the tidal wave of yuletide drinking – or have already allowed yourself to be swept away and are now concerned about how you’ll carry on – allow me to let you in on a secret: you don’t need to do any of

What is this song, she thought, and who is this woman screaming? It took her a further 15 seconds to realise that the roars belonged to her bandmate, Corin Tucker. Their sound was scrappier than Brownstein remembered. The song she’d struggled to recognise?

<p>Ophelia journeys beyond the grave, in a clever and affecting sequel using just the 481 words spoken by Shakespeare’s character</p><p>In the mid-1990s, Paul Griffiths set&nbsp;himself a challenge. He would attempt to give new voice to Hamlet’s Ophelia using only the vocabulary scripted for her by Shakespeare in the original play. In 2008, 13 years after he’d begun, his novel Let Me Tell You was published. Among its admirers was Harry Mathews, the indefatigable North American writer and member of the renowned experimental literary group&nbsp;Oulipo, who described it as “beautiful and enthralling” and “a&nbsp;great success in Oulipian terms”. At&nbsp;the time Griffiths was curious to see&nbsp;if his chosen constraint might provoke another writer to take Ophelia&nbsp;further. Perhaps he got fed up&nbsp;waiting, for it is Griffiths who has produced an exquisite sequel.</p><p>Whereas Let Me Tell You is set before&nbsp;the action of Hamlet, thereby&nbsp;offering Ophelia the chance to&nbs

<p>We were spending Christmas far from home. Very far. It wasn’t easy finding sprouts in Sydney, but the memories formed the basis of a lifelong bond</p><p>By my mid-20s, I’d somehow miraculously managed to branch out into the real world. I had been to university (back when there were no fees and no real pressures). I’d got a job. (“A journalist,” I thought. “That sounds secure and well paid.”) I had even moved in with a girlfriend. All safe in the knowledge that I could rely on my parents to bail me out financially or emotionally should it ever go catastrophically awry.</p><p>So when it <em>did</em> all go wrong (dumped by girlfriend; sacked by job), it seemed strange to decide to move to the other side of the world, where my mum would be too far away for an “It’s all right, dear” hug. Luckily, I had my best friend, Phil, who had reached a similar, ahem, “gap” in his career and relationship résumé, so a plan was hatched to move to Australia.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/

<p>It’s 40 years since Madonna began scandalising and delighting fans and critics around the world. But is she still misunderstood? With Mary Gabriel</p><p>She’s an enduring global superstar, with 330m albums sold worldwide. And she has just begun the US leg of her first greatest hits tour, celebrating 40 years in the industry. It’s hard to think of anyone who is as overexposed as Madonna – but, says her biographer <strong>Mary Gabriel</strong>, fundamental misconceptions about her remain.</p><p>Critics accuse her of being a cultural vampire, insisting it is ambition, not talent, that has powered her career. Instead, Gabriel argues, to really understand Madonna’s career you need to understand the New York club scene that fostered her talent. From Andy Warhol to the Beastie Boys and Jean-Michel Basquiat, it was a community that was intent on breaking taboos and boundaries, and the Material Girl, she believes, has never lost that sensibility.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/ne

<p>The time for excuses at Chelsea is over, Anfield awaits for Manchester United and Eddie Howe must stop the rot</p><p>There is often fear when a former favourite returns but Brennan Johnson will be welcomed back with open arms at Nottingham Forest even though he may hope to leave as a pantomime villain. The Wales international progressed through the ranks at the City Ground, becoming integral to Forest’s promotion, and was a key reason they stayed up last season. Such form meant his departure over the summer became an inevitability, especially because the money on offer was much needed. No offence to Forest but Tottenham is a big step up for Johnson and he has taken time to adapt to his new surroundings and the management of Ange Postecoglou. Pressure has grown on Tottenham’s forwards in recent weeks following James Maddison’s injury but, after four defeats in five, they found their feet against Newcastle. Johnson has one goal and two assists in his short Tottenham career but retur
