  <p id="8J22or">Apple has blocked a Bluetooth attack carried out with the Flipper Zero that sent a barrage of pop-ups to iPhones, causing them to lock up and crash. While Apple hasn’t formally announced the change, it appears the company has rolled out a fix in iOS 17.2, according to tests from <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/ios-17-2-update-puts-an-end-to-flipper-zero-iphone-shenanigans/"><em>ZDNET</em></a> and <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/12/15/the-jig-is-up-flipper-zero-devices-can-no-longer-crash-iphones-running-ios-17-2/"><em>9to5Mac</em></a>.</p>

  <p id="xa0Yzf">On Friday, two days after Threads finally started publicly testing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/13/24000120/threads-meta-activitypub-test-mastodon">ActivityPub integration</a>, Instagram head Adam Mosseri shared <a href="https://www.threads.net/@mosseri/post/C046LSmPAuN">a thread on Threads</a> detailing the company’s plans for its continued integration with the fediverse. Right now, it’s possible to follow a few Threads accounts (including Mosseri’s) from other platforms, but Meta has much bigger plans for Threads interoperability that Mosseri says will take “the better part of a year” to realize.</p>
