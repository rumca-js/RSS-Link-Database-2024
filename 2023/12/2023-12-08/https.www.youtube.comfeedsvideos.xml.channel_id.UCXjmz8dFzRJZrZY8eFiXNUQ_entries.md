When the animated superhero show Invincible first hit Amazon Prime, audiences were quickly enamored with this new look for comic book adaptations.  Invincible was a showcase of next level action-choreography for American animation.  The show is both a love letter to and a deconstruction of everything great about superhero stories.  Proving that we need more adult centered animation, like Invincible, produced in the US.
