Just as Star Wars blends elements of sci-fi, fantasy, and various world mythologies, so too does Zack Snyder's Rebel Moon. One of the alien species depicted in Rebel Moon is a winged creature very similar to the griffins of European mythology. This creature is called a bennu and in this extended exclusive clip from Part One, we see it in action as an indentured servant named Tarak (played by Staz Nair) attempts to tame it so that it can be flown.

Rebel Moon - Part One: A Child of Fire launches on Netflix on December 22, with Rebel Moon - Part Two: The Scargiver following on April 19, 2024.

Director Zack Snyder has made no secret of the fact that his new two-part sci-fi film Rebel Moon was originally imagined as a Star Wars project, with the filmmaker even pitching Lucasfilm boss Kathleen Kennedy on his vision for a trilogy before Disney acquired Lucasfilm in 2012.

Reflecting on that pitch during a chat with IGN from his Los Angeles home in November, Snyder says, “In a lot of ways it's better for the movie that I ended up having to do it outside of the Star Wars universe because I think that there's a lot of rules that I would've had to have broken of Star Wars canon.”

Rebel Moon - Part One: A Child of Fire launches on Netflix on December 22, with Rebel Moon - Part Two: The Scargiver following on April 19, 2024.
