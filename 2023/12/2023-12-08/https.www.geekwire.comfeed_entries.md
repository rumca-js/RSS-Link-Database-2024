On a winding path through the Seattle Chinese Garden at South Seattle College, a new immersive light and sound experience has opened called Astra Lumina. The installation follows previous openings in the U.S. in New York, Los Angeles, and Gatlinburg, Tenn. Billed as &#8220;an enchanted night walk amongst the stars,&#8221; Astra Lumina features 10 different and dramatic light displays set to atmospheric music and nature sounds.

Founded last year by longtime friends Derek Tu and Aditya Chempakasseril, Carbon aims to ride tailwinds from the generative AI rush by streamlining the way LLMs access unstructured data from third-party applications like Google Drive and SharePoint. The idea is to replace custom pipelines companies need to build to make that type of data — ranging from text, audio, and image — available to LLMs. Carbon&#8217;s customers include Jenni.ai, AskAI, and DrLambda.

However, the Dec. 5 ruling by U.S. Senior District Judge Marsha J. Pechman in Seattle left the door open for Hold Security LLC to refile the cas.e to address what the judge found to be shortcomings in its facts and arguments. Hold Security, based in the Milwaukee area, alleged in its suit earlier this year that Microsoft misused Hold&#8217;s database of stolen account credentials, culled from the dark web,&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/judge-dismisses-hold-securitys-lawsuit-over-microsofts-use-of-stolen-account-credentials/">Read More</a>

In August 2021 the company announced a $35 million Series C round led by NGP Energy Capital, with participation from Alphabet and others. The latest funding is a follow on of that round. LevelTen declined to name the source of the additional capital. &#8220;With the development of many strong tailwinds in the clean energy industry, we have identified exciting opportunities to accelerate product development that go beyond what we envisioned during our Series C financing in 2021,&#8221; a LevelTen spokesperson&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/levelten-which-helps-facilitate-clean-energy-deals-adds-10m-to-series-c-round/">Read More</a>
