		A preliminary and delayed report on fiscal 2023 for Mitek is out and while the numbers available are positive, the document has holes.

Very few GAAP figures have been published by Mitek. Non-GAAP numbers are more common, but still scarce.

		Malaysia’s digital identity – known as MyDigital ID – will be available to the general public by July next year, according to the country’s national research and development center <a href="https://www.mimos.my/main/">Mimos</a> in charge of implementing the project.

MyDigital ID will be rolled out in four phases, starting with the members of the Malaysian Cabinet and followed by civil servants, government benefits recipients and finally the general public, says Saat Shukri Embong, head of the technology venture sector at Mimos.

“By then we will have about 30 million people onboard. With the volume, we hope it can entice private sectors like banks to adopt MyDigital ID,” Saat said on Wednesday during a press briefing, <a href="https://theedgemalaysia.com/node/69291

		Lawyers defending U.S. companies sued for breaking biometric privacy laws sometimes make comparisons between the large fines businesses face and the theoretical harm a person might suffer if their identifiers were misused or stolen.

The implication is that biometrics theft is inconsequential for victims and rare compared to the large and growing number of biometric information privacy <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202311/bipa-keeping-courtrooms-and-lobbyists-busy">cases</a> businesses face.

And yet, breaches continue. Two companies that deal in personal health information companies are talking about data losses. One of them, a life insurance firm, even lost biometric security information.

The two companies are Pan-American Life Insurance Group, which goes by PA
