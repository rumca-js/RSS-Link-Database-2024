After <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-fortnite-feels-a-minecraft-for-the-metaverse-era\">yesterday's big launch of Lego Fortnite</a>, today brings Rocket Racing - and, again, you can play it for free right now.\n</p><p>\nDeveloped by Rocket League studio Psyonix, Rocket Racing is an arcade racer with shades of Mario Kart and Burnout, blended with some of Rocket League's mechanics. \n</p><p>\nYou can roar around tracks, slipstream past or slam into rivals to knock them about, aim for boost pads, avoid obstacles, and accumulate boost by drifting. You also have a limited ability to jump - sending your vehicle soaring vertically upwards to higher portions of track or over barriers and through waterfalls to secret shortcuts. \n</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogame", "link": "https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnites-rocket-racing-is-a-fun-mix-of-rocket-league-and-mario-kart", "date_published": "2023-12-08T17:18:59+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "Eurogamer.net Latest Articles Feed", "album": "Eurogamer.net Latest Articles Feed", "user": null, "language": "en-gb", "thumbnail": null, "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.eurogamer.net/feed", "title": "No Man's Sky re-running all this year's limited-time Expeditions starting today", "description": "<img src=\"https://assetsio.reedpopcdn.com/no-mans-sky-echoes-art-crop.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp\" /> <p>\nAs is now something of an end-of-year tradition, Hello Games has announced it's re-running all this year's No Man's Sky limited-time Expeditions (plus a bonus one from 2021) throughout the festive period for those that missed them - and their associated rewards - first time around.\n</p><p>\nExpeditions, if you're unfamiliar, are essentially curated several-hour-long campaigns that condense and reshuffle No Man's Sky's various systems into a series of progression-based milestone challenges that play out on a brand-new save - with exclusive (and often extremely nifty) rewards unlocking as you complete each tier.\n</p><p>\n2023, which has been <a href=\"https://www.nomanssky.com/2023/12/holiday-2023-expeditions/\">another busy year</a> for No Man's Sky,  has seen the release of three Expeditions in total, <a href=\"https://www.", "link": "https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-sky-re-running-all-this-years-limited-time-expeditions-starting-today", "date_published": "2023-12-08T16:56:23+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "Eurogamer.net Latest Articles Feed", "album": "Eurogamer.net Latest Articles Feed", "user": null, "language": "en-gb", "thumbnail": null, "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.eurogamer.net/feed", "title": "Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is one of the most technologically impressive games of the year", "description": "<img src=\"https://assetsio.reedpopcdn.com/1_AWDJ28m.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp\" /> <p>\nWhat a year it's been for real-time 3D graphics!
