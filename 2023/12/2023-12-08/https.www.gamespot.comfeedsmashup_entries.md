<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/">Lego Fortnite</a> is a survival-crafting game that is also an off-shoot of the massive free-to-play battle royale. In order to build better tools and buildings, you will need to track down a large variety of crafting materials, including the elusive Shells, which are required for the first Crafting Table upgrade. Lego Fortnite has a nice little tutorial, but it doesn't tell you where to find Shells.

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/">Lego Fortnite</a> has arrived, and this survival-crafting game feels like a mash-up between Minecraft and Fortnite, with a Lego aesthetic. As with many crafting-focused games, you will need to acquire a variety of different raw materials and refine them into even better materials. One of those materials is Wooden Planks, which you need early on in Lego Fortnite to craft tools like an axe and pickaxe.
