<p>His dub poetry had a rhythm that attached you to its words. He was a rebel, a guiding light, and my hero</p><p>Benjamin Zephaniah was a brilliant poet and an incredible human being. He had dyslexia but he ended up on the national curriculum. He grew up in Birmingham and left school at 14 and got into trouble. Before he came to London he used to sleep with a gun under his pillow but he never wanted to be part of that world. Literature was a way out.</p><p>The first time I came across his work I was about 17 years of age, on a housing estate in Atherton, Manchester and someone gave me a pamphlet stapled together called Pen Rhythm. A couple of years later I published my own pamphlet, stapled together, called Perceptions of the Pen. He’s been a guiding light all my life.</p><p>Lemn Sissay is a poet, author and the former chancellor of the University of Manchester</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/dec/08/benjamin-zephaniah-trailblazer-broke-every-glass-ceiling-lemn-si

## Alfie Barbeary: ‘I’ve been honest that I’m not the biggest fan of the gym’

<p>The Bath No 8 on why he is not an identikit sportsman and his aspirations to make the international grade with England</p><p>By his own admission Alfie Barbeary is “different”. He is certainly refreshingly honest. Ask him to describe his perfect day and, having already revealed his dislike of the gym, he does not hesitate. “I’d probably be at home watching the rugby, have a couple of pints with my dad and then finish it off with a curry.” Lob in a game of darts – “My dad isn’t any good so I’d have to get my brother back and play him” – and he would be in absolute heaven.</p><p>A mischievous grin, a pair of sparkling studs in his ears – “Mum wasn’t too happy” – and an obvious lust for life are further clues that this might not be an identikit professional sportsman with his nutritionist on speed dial. Stick the fun-loving Bath No 8 on a rugby pitch, however, and – boom – there are few more compelling forces of oval-ball nature in the English club game.</p> <a href="https://www.theg

<p>The centre-back, invaluable to Arsenal’s push for Premier League, was signed by man now in charge at Villa Park</p><p>Even in the most heated debates around the legacy Unai Emery bequeathed Arsenal in 2019, there is one incontestable point. William Saliba arrived that summer with a £27m price tag and a glowing reputation as one of the world’s most feted teenage centre-backs, but another three years would pass before he made an appearance for them. Emery was long gone by then but it is little exaggeration to say Arsenal have been transformed by Saliba’s signing from Saint-Étienne. On Saturday the pair will meet at Villa Park in what, against most pre-season expectations, may prove a pivotal clash between title contenders.</p><p>It is another chance for Saliba and Arsenal, on a six-game winning run in all competitions, to demonstrate that they can stay the course this time. “We have the experience of last season, of course we are better,” he says. “Maybe we can go one better.”</p> <

<p>Jacob van Ruisdael’s landscapes have a mood of introspection and a stillness that lets you feel the movement of air and earth</p><p>During the Covid pandemic, there was a boom in pet adoptions. For a while, there was even a puppy shortage, as people who had long dreamed of adding an animal to their households found themselves more or less locked into their homes, with the time on their hands that a pet, especially a toothy maniacal puppy, requires. It turned out that lot of people had been waiting for just such an opportunity: I was one of these people.</p><p>A few months into lockdown, Basso, a lagotto romagnolo with floppy ears and dirty blond curls, entered our household. He was a truffle hunter by breed; by birth, less romantically, he was from the Rotterdam suburbs. A proud parent, I was convinced that there had never been a softer, cuter, smarter puppy in all the history of puppies. He was the sweetest thing that ever chewed a shoe.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/w

If it runs in your colours, then the answer, clearly, is no. “It is a privilege to be given a horse like this,” Michael Buckley, the owner of Constitution Hill, said recently. “You can buy lots of horses, but it’s a gift if you get something that is so exceptional, and it’s a joy and a thrill and the worrying bits [when he runs] are just part of life. I’d rather have the worries than not have the horse, anyway.”</p><p>From the point of view of the racecourses that stage the show, however, it could conceivably be a different story.

<p>Catwalk in the city’s fashionable Northern Quarter celebrated its musical, cultural and sporting prowess</p><p>“It is radically unexpected. Truly extraordinary. Genuinely off the wall. It is so superincongruous that it’s weirdly interesting.”<br /><br />The renowned designer Peter Saville, speaking to the Guardian a few hours before Chanel’s catwalk show, painted quite the picture of the “dynamically unusual” state visit by the most august and courtly of Parisian fashion houses to the rainy streets of Manchester.<br /><br />A front row that ran past the tattoo parlours, pubs and karaoke bars of the Northern Quarter brought together Tilda Swinton with Gary Neville, and Hugh Grant with John Cooper Clarke. On the street catwalk, the bodice of a cocktail dress was hand-embroidered in concentric circles of jet beads to look like the liquorice-black grooves on a vinyl record, while intarsia cashmere sweaters were plastered in graphics inspired by nightclub flyers.

Warren’s formative clubbing experiences were in the 80s and 90s, a golden era, simply because there were more venues. Clubs and

Nobody was born like that!’” She laughs, but she is dead serious. Dancing is toil. You can be one of the best ballerinas in the world, as Cojocaru i

I was 17, on a family holiday in Spain, and when we arrived at the hotel at 10pm, my foot was all swollen.</p><p>I got talking to a group of people my age and we went to a nightclub. Then we went to sit by a swimming pool and someone asked if I wanted to go skinny dipping. I jumped up and took my clothes off, but it was dark and I couldn’t see the pool’s dimensions. I dived into the shallow end, banging my head and instantly damaging my spinal cord. It felt like air deflating out of a balloon.

<p>The wealthy elite’s dominance of our impoverished society is often seen as inevitable, even natural – but their spell can be broken</p><p>For millions of Britons, this feels more and more like a poor country. Essentials such as heating and regular meals are increasingly unaffordable. Public services are struggling, and avoided by many of those who can afford to. Old infrastructure such as schools and hospitals is visibly crumbling. Even “middle-income Brits”, the Resolution Foundation reported this week, “are now <a href="https://economy2030.resolutionfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Ending-stagnation-final-report.pdf">20% poorer</a> than their peers in Germany”.</p><p>Yet for a substantial minority of other Britons, life is ever more luxurious. “The big story of the last 40 years has been of private wealth racing ahead,” says the thinktank, “rising from around three times to more than seven times [the size] of GDP.” This long <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/20

<p>This flawless drama sees Timothy Spall put in the best performance of his career.

No, <em>in</em> you. Frame after searing frame. The Sixth Commandment, written by Sarah Phelps and directed by Saul Dibb, was the most gut-wrenching example of the year. Perhaps the decade. In four harrowing, nigh-on unbearable episodes it took a genre often prurient, insensitive and morally dubious, and gracefully upended it. The Sixth Commandment was true crime that focused on the victims, though even to use that word feels like a thoughtless reduction. What it gave was a dignity rarely afforded, neither on screen nor in life

Many came to believe that governments should run large deficits during recessions and only slightly smaller deficits in normal times. No one seemed concerned with the possible risks, in particular to inflation and interest rates.

The Eagles’ only win in their previous eight matches came at Turf Moor against Burnley and they have suffered demoralising defeats to Everton, Luton and Bournemouth since. Roy Hodgson took umbrage with the fans booing his side’s dismal efforts against the Cherries on Wednesday.

Picking a fight with the supporters is rarely a sensible move, regardless of a person’s standing at the club.
