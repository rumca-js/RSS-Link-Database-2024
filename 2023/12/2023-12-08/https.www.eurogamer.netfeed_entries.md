Ready for another new Fortnite game mode? After <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-fortnite-feels-a-minecraft-for-the-metaverse-era">yesterday's big launch of Lego Fortnite</a>, today brings Rocket Racing - and, again, you can play it for free right now.
</p><p>
Developed by Rocket League studio Psyonix, Rocket Racing is an arcade racer with shades of Mario Kart and Burnout, blended with some of Rocket League's mechanics. 
</p><p>
You can roar around tracks, slipstream past or slam into rivals to knock them about, aim for boost pads, avoid obstacles, and accumulate boost by drifting. You also have a limited ability to jump - sending your vehicle soaring vertically upwards to higher portions of track or over barriers and through waterfalls to secret shortcuts.

As is now something of an end-of-year tradition, Hello Games has announced it's re-running all this year's No Man's Sky limited-time Expeditions (plus a bonus one from 2021) throughout the festive period for those that missed them - and their associated rewards - first time around.
</p><p>
Expeditions, if you're unfamiliar, are essentially curated several-hour-long campaigns that condense and reshuffle No Man's Sky's various systems into a series of progression-based milestone challenges that play out on a brand-new save - with exclusive (and often extremely nifty) rewards unlocking as you complete each tier.
</p><p>
2023, which has been <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/2023/12/holiday-2023-expeditions/">another busy year</a> for No Man's Sky,  has seen the release of three Expeditions in total, <a href="https://www.

## Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is one of the most technologically impressive games of the year

What a year it's been for real-time 3D graphics! With Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, we're looking at one of the most visually accomplished releases of 2023, seemingly released without much fanfare. However, when you look at the creators behind the franchise and the game, perhaps we should have expected something special. It's hard to deny the attention to detail that James Cameron has as a creator, not to mention Avatar's reputation for pushing the limits of movie CG. But how do you compress down the blockbuster experience when rendering on a home console? That is where Ubisoft Massive comes in with its superb Snowdrop engine. The tech delivered sensational results on prior titles primarily designed for last-gen hardware, but with a new baseline in technology defined by PC and the latest consoles, Massive has delivered an Avatar game wo

Zombie MMO The Day Before is now out in early access, but is receiving overwhelmingly negative reviews on Steam.
</p><p>
It's been a rocky road for the game, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-day-before-dev-insists-zombie-mmo-is-not-a-scam-following-latest-delay">accusations the game was a scam</a>, copying the work of other developers, criticism against the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/delayed-steam-pre-order-hit-the-day-before-developer-defends-use-of-unpaid-volunteers">use of unpaid volunteers</a>, and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/calendar-app-company-confirms-the-day-before-trademark-dispute">trademark dispute with a Korean calendar app</a>.

Since their establishment in 2014, The Game Awards have never been wholly welcomed by the wider world of video games, but this year the response has felt if not different, then at least more prominent. There is an undeniable sense, waking up after last night's ceremony-cum-advertisement reel, that developers in particular are deeply frustrated.
</p><p>
Naturally, there are caveats. In 2023 the industry still regularly debates itself about all manner of things, from whether community managers and in-house PRs count as game devs to, as Dave the Diver reminded us, what exactly counts as an indie game. I'd expect no more unanimity on the topic of The Game Awards as I would any of those. But there is definitely a prominent, loud, and absolute

Last night brought a first look at Tales of Kenzera: Zau, a personal project from Abubakar Salim - the voice of Bayek in Assassin's Creed Origins and star of HBO's Raised by Wolves. 
</p><p>
A single-player side-scrolling platformer, Tales of Kenzera: Zau is  the debut game from Salim's Surgent Studios, and is being published by EA via its Originals label.
</p><p>
Salim appeared on stage at The Game Awards last night, visibly emotional, to share how the game had been inspired by the loss of his father - with whom he had shared a love of video games.

Connecting Worlds will be released across the globe in the spring of next year, via Disney+.
</p><p>
The Hideo Kojima documentary is said to promise a "creative journey into the mind of a video games icon", giving us a "rare insight" into Kojima's creative process. 
</p><p>
Many famous faces have contributed to this project, including the likes of Norman Reedus - who is currently working with Kojima on Death Stranding's sequel - and filmmaker Guillermo del Toro.

## Game of the Week: A Highland Song is the right kind of slog

I don't know if you've been for a hike recently, but I often feel like I live each hike twice. There's the thinking about the hike - planning it, walking through it in my head - and then there's the actual hike, where shoelaces break, my foot gets stuck in a cattle grate, I realise I forgot something or I read the map wrong. The works.
</p><p>
I struggle to tell which of these hikes is more real - or rather if there's any meaningful difference in the degree of realness of each one. It reminds me of a brilliant short story - maybe my favourite short story ever - by Mark Helprin. In The Schreuderspritze, Wallich, a young photographer, I think, is lost in grief following the death of his wife and child. He goes to the Alps and decides to climb one of the trickiest mountains. He spends the rest of the story preparing - gett

Nintendo has added three more classic N64 games to its Switch Online expansion pack: 1080&deg; Snowboarding, Harvest Moon 64 and Jet Force Gemini.
</p><p>
With these latest additions, we will all be able to shred it on the slopes with some sick flips and spins (or, in my case, go barrelling down into a snowy heap) before nipping over to do a spot farming. Then, we can head to space, where our craft is decked out with a pair of hanging dice.
</p><p>
You can watch a little teaser for them below.

Peacock went on to share its own announcement on YouTube, showing Twisted Metal's Sweet Tooth hacking away at the screen. You can have a watch below.

This time around, I went back to a game that I've not touched since February 2023 - Animal Crossing: New Horizons.

Well, the good news is a new Monster Hunter's on the way - hooray! The bad news is we'll have to wait until 2025 play it - boo. Still, we do at least get an atmospheric teaser trailer to scrutinise until Capcom is ready to reveal more.
</p><p>
So what can we expect to see in Monster Hunter Wilds, as the "next generation" of the series is known? Well, starting off in a dusty desert world, the trailer shows off some large migrating herds of smaller creatures - far more dense than anything we've really seen before in the series - as well as a new bird-like mode of transport for Hunters.
</p><p>
We get vast swirling sandstorms, violent storms raining lightning down upon the earth as creatures rampage, and, well, that's about it for the moment - although I'm sure more eagle-eyed fans will have picked the whole thing more t

No Rest for the Wicked is a new action role-playing game from Moon Studios, the developer behind Ori and the Blind Forest. 
</p><p>
Announced tonight at The Game Awards, the project features a darker and more realistic visual design than the rather cute visuals of Ori. It'll launch via early access on Steam in the first quarter of 2024, then at some point later on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.
</p><p>
More details will be announced in March during a showcase set to delve deeper into the game and its mechanics.

Exoborne is an eye-catching new tactical open-world extraction shooter for PC and consoles, built in Unreal Engine 5 by team members who worked on Ubisoft's The Division.
</p><p>
It's a fresh IP from Sharkmob, the studio founded in 2017 by core members of The Division team, now working across two studios in Malm&ouml; and London. The developer's first project - battle royale Vampire The Masquerade: Bloodhunt - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/12-months-on-battle-royale-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodhunt-is-ending-development">shut down in May</a>, after failing to find an audience.

The Finals feels so immediate in the impact it has. You load it up, you're thrust into a three-player team and then into an arena with other teams, then you're legging it through levels that are being bust apart around you, rappelling up buildings, smashing through walls, lobbing foam-expanding grenades and swinging heavy sledgehammers. Then you're legging it back another way with a safe of money you've found, trying to deposit it at a vault, all while the other teams frantically pepper you with bullets and hunt you down. There's no breathing space. There's garish colour, noise, energy, adrenaline and excitement. That is The Finals.</p><p>It really reminds me of Overwatch, actually, in how polished it feels and how the menu

The first part of Final Fantasy 16's DLC is out tonight: Echoes of the Fallen.
</p><p>
Game director Naoki Yoshida <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-16s-pc-port-is-finally-in-development">announced in September paid DLC was being developed</a> (after initially stating the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-16-producer-confirms-no-plans-for-dlc">game was a "one-off"</a>, and then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-thinking-about-final-fantasy-16-dlc-yoshida-says">later hinting</a> he was "thinking about" options).
</p><p>Echoes of the Fallen is the first part of two DLC expansions. It will be followed by The Rising Tide in spring 2024, which will include the Eikon Leviathan as speculated by players, as well as a terrifying-looking Tonberry King.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fanta

How do you follow-up a game that attempts to simulate an entire universe for your exploratory enjoyment? Hello Games has just answered that very question with the reveal of its next title, Light No Fire, a co-operative adventure set on a procedurally generated fantasy planet.
</p><p>
Specifics are limited at present, but Hello describes Light No Fire as a game about "adventure, building, survival and exploration together" set on an ancient fantasy planet the size of Earth, that "brings the depth of a role playing game to the freedom of a survival sandbox".
</p><p>
The planet itself is procedurally generated, offering a "truly open world, with no boundaries at a scale never attempted before", consisting of "immersive biomes, unique enemies and valuable resources to discover". It's all inspired by classic

Payday 3 might've failed to wow, but there's reason for heist fans to remain cheerful: GTFO studio 10 Chamber - which was co-founded by Payday 1 and 2 veterans including designer Ulf Andersson - has announced Den of Wolves, a sci-fi take on the Payday formula.
</p><p>
Den of Wolves (which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gtfo-developer-10-chambers-has-a-co-op-heist-fps-in-pre-production">teased back in August</a>) got its formal unveiling at this year's The Game Awards via an enigmatic reveal trailer, but I had the opportunity to spent some time with 10 Chambers co-founder and narrative director Simon Viklund ahead of the show, to learn a little more about the studio's plans for the project.

Development on 10 Chambers' rock-hard co-op horror shooter GTFO is officially coming to an end today after three years of robust post-launch support with one last update, the appropriately titled The Final Chapter.
</p><p>
GTFO - which sends teams of up to four players on regular expeditions deep into the bowels of a vast underground complex overrun by terrifying creatures - got its version 1.0 release back in December 2019 after two years of early access. It's essentially been run as a live-service-style title since then (albeit without any live-service-style monetisation), adding a succession of time-limited story missions, maps, and other content.

Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth has an all-new theme song written by series composer Nobuo Uematsu.
</p><p>
The song was performed at The Game Awards along with new footage of the game, though below is the official trailer with even more footage - most importantly including a look at the chainsmoking Cid, as well as summons Titan, Bahamut Arisen, and Phoenix for the first time. 
</p><p>
There's also lots of Zack, a better look at the Gold Saucer, and nods to familiar scenes from the game - including <em>that</em> moment.

Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage is a new IP from the Don't Nod team that made the first two Life is Strange titles, before the franchise was continued on elsewhere and the team <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/life-is-strange-creators-working-on-fresh-ip-at-new-montreal-studio">moved out of Don't Nod's Parisian headquarters to set up shop in Montreal</a>.

After a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warframes-big-weird-whispers-in-the-walls-expansion-out-in-december-with-cross-save">big old information splurge at the end of last month</a>, developer Digital Extremes has announced Warframe's fascinatingly weird Whispers in the Walls expansion - which introduces a new story campaign, a new Warframe, cross-save, and more - will launch for Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and PC next Wednesday, 13th December.

Whispers in the Walls, in case you haven't been following along with Digital Extremes' previous showings, promises to reveal the "proverbial big bang" that kicked off every event in Warframe - and it all starts with the long-hidden (until the expansion's arrival, that is (laboratory of Albrecht Entrati, deep in the bowels of the planet Deimos.

Jurassic Park: Survival was announced at this evening's Game Awards.
</p><p>
It's an upcoming single-player action-adventure game set the day after the events of the 1993 Jurassic Park film. Judging by the announcement trailer, we will play as a character called Maya on the game's release (which is TBC). 
</p><p>
She is aware she is alone on the island of Nublar, as I guess Alan and co forgot to make sure everyone was off the island before they took flight. Seems a bit remiss of them, really.

Wondering what Hideo Kojima's been brewing between Strandings? Well, we finally have an answer - albeit an extremely enigmatic one - courtesy of a teaser for new Xbox horror game OD.
</p><p>
A Kojima horror has been rumoured for quite some time, of course, with reports surfacing last year that the Death Stranding creator was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojimas-latest-project-is-reportedly-a-horror-game-called-overdose">cooking up a little something called Overdose</a>.
</p><p>
That, it turns out, was mostly right, with Kojima's new project now revealed under the name OD. As for what it actually is, well, that's currently unclear, with Kojima and friends successfully taking up 10 minutes of tonight's The Game Awards without revealing much of anything at all.

Sega's trailer also stated "&amp; more" - though it's unclear what other series the publisher is pulling out of its broom closet. (No, don't hope for Skies of Arcadia, my heart cannot take it.)

Supermassive Games and Behaviour have unveiled their brand new narrative game set in the world of Dead by Daylight.
</p><p>
The Casting of Frank Stone, as it's called, is an original story with brand new characters. Behaviour announced the project at its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-by-daylight-explores-sci-fi-horror-in-next-chapter">Dead by Daylight livestream earlier this year</a>, but it was officially revealed with a trailer at tonight's The Game Awards.

Last year's The Case of the Golden Idol was a murder-mystery treat, and developer Color Gray Games has now revealed there's more deductive adventure on the way in follow-up The Rise of the Golden Idol, launching for PC and consoles next year.
</p><p>
The big change this time around is that The Rise of the Golden Idol ditches the 18th century setting of its predecessor in favour of a slightly more contemporary time period, whisking players to the 1970s where they'll need to solve 15 new cases of "crime, death and depravity".
</p><p>
The Rise of the Golden Idol will see players attempting to make sense of a grand mystery in an age of "hallucinogens, fax machines, parapsychology and TV guides", in a quest that'll bring them face-to-face with "enlightenment seekers, convicts, chat show hosts and corporate m

Daniel Mullins - the creator behind the acclaimed likes of Inscryption and The Hex - is back with a sequel to his celebrated 2016 oddity Pony Island. It's called Pony Island 2: Panda Circus and is coming Steam at some currently undisclosed future point.
</p><p>
The original Pony Island - a genre-shifting delve into a demonically possessed arcade cabinet - was emphatically not about ponies (well, not <em>exactly</em>), and its sequel promises to continue that tradition, offering a "phantasmagorical voyage through time, myth, divinity, and video game".
</p><p>
This time around, you're cast as a young nomad doomed to live out their untimely death within The Earth Prison. The goal, explains Mullins over on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2017940/Pony_Island_2_Panda_Circus/">Pony Island 2's newly revealed Steam page</a>, is

Developer Motion Twin's hugely acclaimed - and dazzlingly well supported - action-platformer Dead Cells hasn't stop turning heads since its early access debut back in 2017, and it's fair to say interest in what the studio will do next is high; and we finally have an answer courtesy of The Game Awards, which has given a first look at Motion Twin's Windblown, a "lightning-fast combat roguelite" coming to Steam early access in 2024. 
</p><p>
Windblown is a "tough but always fair" combat-focused adventure - playable either solo or with up to three friends online - that casts participants as Leapers, warriors charged with protecting their home world, The Ark, from the deadly Vortex and its Sentinel minions.
</p><p>
Specifics remain relatively limited at this early juncture, but its reveal trailer - giving off some deliciously appealing Satur
