Stewart found refuge in books at the local library – at home he would don gloves and a hat and read in the family’s outdoor toilet – and, with the encouragement of a schoolteacher, developed a love of Shakespeare. This, in turn, led him to the stage and a place at the Bristol Old Vic theatre school, after which he worked in rep and at the Royal Shakespeare Company.</p><p>Stewart, whose booming baritone has lately taken on a warmer and more gravelly timbre, is the book’s narrator.

This collective ritual, which would go on to inspire a mass uprising, now forms the energetic inspiration for Haitian saxophonist Jowee Omicil’s latest album, Spiritual Healing: Bwa Kayiman Freedom Suite. Over an hour, Omicil transposes the imagined energy of the ceremony into a free jazz interpretation, switching between several woodwinds and brass while accompanied by percussion, keys and bass.</p><p>The album opens minimally, with Omicil vocalising over plaintive snatches of saxophone melody, guttural bass clarinet and rattles of percussionist Yoann Danier’s ka drum.
