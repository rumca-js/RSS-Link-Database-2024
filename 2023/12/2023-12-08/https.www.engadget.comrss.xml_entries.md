Remedy just announced that the game is getting free DLC next week, December 11, in the form of a New Game Plus mode. This has been a long-requested feature for fans of the title. Well, if by long-requested you mean within the past two months.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Alan Wake 2: The Final Draft</em> will include a brand-new ending for the story, though you must first beat the game in the traditional way to access it. Remedy says this ending will “spark speculation and theories from dedicated fans.” The updates go beyond the last act, however, as <em>The Final Draft</em> will feature new lore videos and manuscript pages and, of course, tougher enemies.</p>

<p>Remedy’s <em>Alan Wake 2</em> was also on fire, winning best game direction, best narrative and best art direction, among others. <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> paraglided away with the statue for best action/adventure and the RPG <em>Sea of Stars</em> won for best indie game, with <em>Cocoon</em> being awarded best debut indie game.</p>

<p>We’ve covered Framework’s modular, easy-to-repair laptops plenty here at Engadget and with good reason. Its mission is to end the need for users to toss out an otherwise perfect machine when just one component goes dead. But, as the company matures, it also has to tackle the issue of what happens when people choose to upgrade for performance reasons. An early buyer might choose to swap their 11th-gen Intel mainboard for any of its successors, or leap across the aisle to get the newly-released AMD edition. That leaves them with an otherwise perfectly functional mainboard they either have to sell on, turn into a hobby project or, more likely, leave on a shelf gathering dust as a just-in-case option. That’s why the company hooked up with Cooler Master to give you a far better alternative.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-03-turn-off-comments-wont-fix-internet.html">Comment sections</a> can be a place of both community and animosity, with the speed of responses presenting a moderation challenge. YouTube is attempting to find a happy balance, announcing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkRfArvrzheW2E7b6SVT7vQ/community?lb=UgkxP6pziafkHJ4fyaHxfK38vNh5mtk6oYoM">additional comment controls for creators</a> — most notably the option to pause comments. The company trialed the feature and is now rolling it out to everyone.</p>
<p>The option to pause allows for existing comments to remain visible while not allowing other accounts to submit any more. Previously, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/youtubes-upcoming-ai-powered-creator-tools-include-a-generative-green-screen-203144786.html">creators</a> could only disable comments from their channel or review each one before posting.

<p>Virtual private networks (VPNs) have been having a moment recently. Massive marketing budgets and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-influencer-selling-vpns-security-problems-153046206.html">influencer collaborations </a>have convinced consumers that a VPN’s functionality and privacy features will solve all of their security woes. However, it’s not as cut-and-dry as that. VPNs are just one part of a robust online security routine, but given the number of VPN services out there today, it can be hard to figure out which one will be right for you. Not to mention that you often have to dig through <a href="https://www.engadget.com/us-congress-wants-the-ftc-to-regulate-the-vpn-industry-074102207.html">claims of attributes that aren’t always totally accurate</a> to get to that answer.

<p>Amazon regularly makes changes to the costs and availability of its groceries. The company's latest attempt to drive more business comes in the form of a subscription plan. Prime members can now pay $10 monthly for unlimited free Amazon Fresh and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-02-08-amazon-whole-foods-prime-now.html">Whole Foods deliveries</a> on orders over $35. The subscription also includes unlimited 30-minute pickup orders, regardless of the amount spent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The addition of Whole Foods is notable as any delivery from the retailer through Amazon has included a $10 delivery fee since 2021. However, Amazon Fresh grocery deliveries over $35 were already free for Prime members until early this year when Amazon added a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-fresh-minimum-order-over-150-free-delivery-105538439.html">fee for grocery deliveries under $150</a>.

<p>The UK is considering an investigation into Microsoft's partnership with OpenAI to decide if it has resulted in an &quot;acquisition of control&quot; that's subject to antitrust law, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-seeks-views-on-microsofts-partnership-with-openai">wrote today</a>. The regulator said it's considering &quot;recent developments,&quot; no doubt referring to the Sam Altman CEO ouster drama in which Microsoft played a large role.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;The CMA is now issuing an ITC to determine whether the Microsoft/OpenAI partnership, including recent developments, has resulted in a relevant merger situation and, if so, the potential impact on competition,&quot; it said in a news release. &quot;The CMA will review whether the partnership has resulted in an acquisition of control — that is, where it results in one party having material influence, de facto control or more than 50% of the voting rights over another

<p>Hideo Kojima officially unveiled his upcoming game (that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hideo-kojima-overdose-leak-death-stranding-margaret-qualley-154257824.html">leaked in 2022</a>) at the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/watch-the-game-awards-2023-here-at-730pm-et-190011911.html">Game Awards 2023</a>. Previously described as something “no one has ever experienced or seen before,” the cinematic <em>OD</em> (previously known as <em>Overdose</em>) will include a collaboration with horror director and comedian Jordan Peele.</p>
<p><em>OD</em>’s 90-second trailer includes intimate closeups of actors reading nursery rhymes and other dialogue as they grow increasingly frantic. In the clip’s final moments, you catch a glimpse of a door opening in the reflection of their eyes (with a creaking sound hammering the point home). Wherever the game’s plot takes us, the trailer makes it clear it falls squarely in the horror genre (as expected).</p>

<p>Sorry <em>Evolution</em> fans, there’s a new <em>Jurassic Park</em> game in town. Saber Interactive and Universal just dropped a trailer for <em>Jurassic Park: Survival </em>at The Game Awards.<em>&nbsp;</em>This is an adventure game <a href="https://jurassicparksurvival.com/"><ins>set on Isla Nublar</ins></a> just one day after the events of the original film. You play as InGen scientist Dr. Maya Joshi, who missed the last plane out of dodge. In other words, she’s stuck on an island full of hungry dinosaurs.</p>
<div id="06b2933da2a84dcb885f00c09f722f8e"></div>
<p>The single-player action-adventure has you hiding from all kinds of menacing species, and the publisher boasts that each dinosaur boasts its own set of “distinct and adaptive behaviors.” Obviously, with a name like <em>Jurassic Park: Survival,</em> staying alive will be the name of the game. There’s not much, after all, one person can do to hurt a rampaging T-rex. This looks to be a stealth-heavy nailbiter, but one with

<p>Sega promised a new era at The Game Awards, and it gave us five games to look forward to. Well, &quot;new&quot; is doing a lot of heavy lifting: The storied developer announced that fresh titles are coming based on Crazy Taxi, Jet Set Radio, Shinobi, Golden Axe and Streets of Rage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Depending on your age, those titles may mean various things to you. Golden Axe and Shinobi have their roots in the arcades of the '80s, while Streets of Rage is a Genesis classic. <em>Crazy Taxi </em>and <em>Jet Set Radio</em> were both released in the Dreamcast era (with Crazy Taxi making its debut in arcades first).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Supermassive Games just dropped a trailer for its forthcoming single-player interactive story game set in the <em>Dead by Daylight</em> universe. <em>The Casting of Frank Stone</em> is a character-driven narrative adventure that features all of the character choice and tension of Supermassive-developed titles like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-quarry-game-release-date-201557551.html"><em>Until Dawn </em>and<em> The Quarry.</em></a></p>
<p>The developer promises “powerful life or death choices” and an entirely new cast of characters. Supermassive says this is a “whole new way for horror fans” <a href="https://twitter.com/DeadbyDaylight/status/1732460041758822411">to experience the franchise,</a> and that’s something of an understatement. <em>Dead by Deadlight</em> is an asymmetrical multiplayer title in which one player is the killer and the others are trying to survive. It’s like a really intense version of hide and seek. Obviously, a single player adventure would have to 

## No Rest for the Wicked is a medieval action RPG from the Ori team

<p><em>No Rest for the Wicked</em> is the new project from Moon Studios, the team behind <em>Ori and the Blind Forest</em> and its sequel — and it looks as beautiful as you'd expect. It's a top-down action RPG set in the year 841, in a kingdom that's just lost its king. His arrogant and inexperienced son has taken over, and the Pestilence is sweeping the land. The turmoil has led a powerful religious leader to expand her influence in the region, and groups on the fringes are fighting for control wherever they can. You play as a holy warrior called a Cerim, imbued with magic and destined to fight the Pestilence.</p>
<p><em>No Rest for the Wicked</em> emphasizes action and precision in a gorgeous medieval setting, and it includes online co-op for up to four players total. It's due to hit early access on Steam in the first quarter of 2024, and it will eventually come to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.</p>

And yet that still doesn't seem to be quite enough Norse action for Kratos. During <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/the-game-awards/">The Game Awards</a>, Sony revealed a Valhalla-centric expansion for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-fastest-selling-sony-exclusive-191147076.html">the 2022 hit</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not only that, it's free. And it's coming next week, on December 12, to both PS4 and PS5 versions of the base game.</p>

<p><em>Big Walk </em>looks to be a significant departure from its predecessor in both tone and scope. The team describes it as &quot;a cooperative online walker-talker&quot; that encourages players to &quot;hang out and get lost with close friends in a big world.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The online coop game is set on an expansive bruch-covered island that's overflowing with mysteries to uncover and challenges to overcome.

<p><em>Exodus</em> is the first game from <a href="https://www.archetype-entertainment.com/">Archetype Entertainment</a>, a studio established by Wizards of the Coast in 2019 and staffed by former developers from BioWare, 343 Industries, Naughty Dog and other AAA establishments. <em>Exodus</em> is a big and bold sci-fi RPG that deals with time dilation, the idea that time passes more slowly than we're used to during high-velocity travel, causing interstellar explorers to outlive their friends and family back home.</p>
<p>In <em>Exodus</em>, humanity has been forced to abandon Earth and establish a new civilization in a hostile galaxy. Players are the Traveler, a person tasked with exploring far-off solar systems for advanced alien technology. What the Traveler counts in days, the rest of humanity experiences in decades. With this conceit, players' choices will cause butterfly effects to ripple across humanity's new planet, particularly in the lives of their own loved ones, and the Tr
