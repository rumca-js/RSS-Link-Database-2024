<p>If anyone was in doubt, this match provided compelling evidence that there are simply too many flaws in the ever-evolving laws of the game. Nottingham Forest made a formal complaint about the referee, Rob Jones, after a contentious defeat at Manchester United earlier this season and his decision to give Willy Boly a second yellow card for a tackle on Adam Smith 24 minutes into this contest, despite Boly cleanly winning the ball, left Forest dumbfounded, wiping PGMOL off the Christmas card list. VAR, as per the rules, was powerless to intervene. One can only wonder what the officials at Stockley Park must have been thinking.</p><p>Forest will point to that decision, leaving them to play with 10 men for more than 70 minutes, as a major factor in a crushing defeat at home to Bournemouth.

## Miniature portraits of Mughal emperors – in pictures

I distort the image so the viewer becomes engrossed in my painting.” The link to the Mughal empire is also important for Talpur: “People die, but their thoughts and ideas live on in different forms.”</p> <a href="https://www.

This year Ding Dong Merrily on High and All I Want for Christmas Is You sound curiously out of place.

<p>Leeds continued their bid for an instant Premier League return with a thumping win against their automatic promotion rivals Ipswich at Elland Road. Pascal Struijk’s early header, Leif Davis’s own goal and Crysencio Summerville’s penalty left the home fans bouncing at half-time as the Tractor Boys hurtled towards only their third league defeat of the season. Joël Piroe crashed home an emphatic finish early in the second half and Leeds, who dropped five points in their previous two matches, could have added more.</p><p>Piroe and Georginio Rutter both saw efforts hit the woodwork and while Conor Chaplin’s first-half shot clipped a post, it was virtually one-way traffic as Daniel Farke’s side extended their unbeaten home record this season to 12 matches and cut the gap between themselves and second-placed Ipswich to seven points. Leeds will be hoping Kieran McKenna’s side drop more points against the leaders, Leicester, on Boxing Day.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/

West Ham were stolid and disciplined but ruthless when their chances arrived during the second half. Their past five goals in the league have all been made by Lucas Paquetá, whose creativity is a key reason for West Ham now being only four points off the top four.

In the tradition of European fairy stories, the underlying themes are dark: poverty, drunkenness, child abuse.

<p>The scorer of the first Premier League goal, the former Sheffield United and Leeds striker could be about to lose a record on Sunday</p><p>There are few players more loved across Yorkshire than Brian Deane. The 6ft 3in former Doncaster, Sheffield United and Leeds striker has an idea why. “Clubs recognise when they have somebody who not only has a lot of endeavour but has a level of skill,” he says. “So I don’t really have anywhere I’ve gone that I can’t go back. I think generally the fans are good with me everywhere. It’s just a case of mutual respect.”</p><p>Deane has a wider place in English football history, though – and one with particular resonance at this time of year. The 55-year-old is perhaps best remembered for scoring the Premier League’s first goal, for Sheffield United against Manchester United on 15 August 1992, but he also got its most recent Christmas Eve strike. The only Premier League fixture played on that date came in 1995 and Deane again haunted Alex Ferguson,

<p>A lively account of the poets, artists and tourists who trooped up the mountain during a period of immense societal change</p><p>In December 1818, the poet Shelley, with his wife Mary and stepsister-in‑law Claire Clairmont, climbed Vesuvius. Starting from the village of Resina (modern Ercolano), they stopped off at the hermitage of San Salvador where an “old hermit” offered refreshments. In a letter to Thomas Love Peacock, Shelley described the ascent to the cone, whose “difficulty has been much exaggerated”. On the summit he surveyed with awe “the most horrible chaos that can be imagined … ghastly chasms … fountains of liquid fire”. The passionate poet confronting the essence of the sublime seems the acme of Romanticism.</p><p>John Brewer’s entertaining social history paints a rather different picture. By the early 19th century the climb to the summit was more well-organised tourist experience than daring psychic journey. True, Vesuvius drew admirers from all over Europe, and eve

These are the recipes I’ll be turning to, then, to extend the taste of Christmas as much as possible.

This acidic novel, first published in 1951, tackles an important subject to which many modern readers will relate: the murderous claustrophobia of a family Christmas. It is also a novel about post-second world war Britain: the nostalgia, grimness and traumatic memories, the fear – of nuclear annihilation and shifting gender roles – and the desperate hopes of this shaken land.</p><p>The setup is gorgeously Agatha Christie, with a nod to the locked-room mystery as disparate family members gather in a large and draughty house.

<p>Walk through a North Yorkshire spa town, then pop in to the Victorian baths before a pint and top-notch food at this festively renamed old pub</p><p>Few towns wear their Christmas ornaments with the charm and panache of Harrogate. Perhaps it’s the mass of wonderful gritstone buildings and all the Victorian shop windows that seem from a bygone age. My end point will be the Coach &amp; Horses on West Park – which has changed its name to the Sleigh &amp; Reindeers for the festive season.</p><p>I start at the railway station and head north, passing one of the country’s great cafes, Bettys. Peering inside I can see a dazzle of polished woodwork and brass, plus platoons of prim staff dressed as if to serve Charles Dickens with cakes that carry names like ginger tart and fat rascal. It always pains me to pass such treats, but it’s too early in the walk to stop.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/dec/23/just-for-christmas-the-harrogate-pub-that-becomes-the-sleigh-reindee
