Worldcoin is cleared for a return to operations in Kenya, BT is planning UK government certification for its digital ID, and a webinar examined SpruceID\u2019s work on California\u2019s mDL. In a slightly different vein, a new partnership between Tech5 and Visa will work on delivering cash transfers from government to people digitally. Each involves contactless biometrics, mostly face. Face biometrics also feature in popular stories about Google\u2019s new age estimation service, Thales\u2019 ambitions in Indonesia\u2019s smart capital city project, and emerging startup VNPay.\n<h2>Top biometrics news of the week</h2>\nW", "link": "https://www.biometricupdate.com/202312/face-biometrics-taking-over-authentication-and-age-assurance", "date_published": "2023-12-23T11:56:10+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "Biometric Update", "album": "Biometric Update", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null, "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.biometricupdate.com/feed", "title": "Biometrics Institute Asia-Pacific Conference", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://d1sr9z1pdl3mb7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/22213340/Biometric-Update-APC-2024-banner.png\" width=\"1024\" />\n\t\t<strong><a href=\"https://www.biometricsinstitute.org/event/asia-pacific-conference-2024/\">Biometrics Institute Asia-Pacific Conference</a></strong>\n<strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>\n<strong>May 22-23, 2024</strong>\n\nFor over two decades, the Asia-Pacific Conference has brought together biometric users from key government agencies, commercial organisations and technology providers to share ideas, spark innovation and discuss the opportunities biometrics offer and its implementational challenges.\n\nThis two-day event provides an amazing networking opportunity, and you can expect a compelling conference agenda featuring high-profile international and local speakers covering the most topical issues.\n\nWHO SHOULD ATTEND:\n- Government in service delivery and border m", "link": "https://www.biometricupdate.com/202312/biometrics-institute-asia-pacific-conference-3", "date_published": "2023-12-23T02:37:07+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "Biometric Update", "album": "Biometric Update", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null, "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}]
