		Biometrics in support of reusable digital ID is a theme running through several of the news articles that drew the most viewers over the past week on <em>Biometric Update</em>. Worldcoin is cleared for a return to operations in Kenya, BT is planning UK government certification for its digital ID, and a webinar examined SpruceID’s work on California’s mDL. In a slightly different vein, a new partnership between Tech5 and Visa will work on delivering cash transfers from government to people digitally. Each involves contactless biometrics, mostly face. Face biometrics also feature in popular stories about Google’s new age estimation service, Thales’ ambitions in Indonesia’s smart capital city project, and emerging startup VNPay.
