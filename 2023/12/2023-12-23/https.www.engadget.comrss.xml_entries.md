<p>Bluesky, the invite-only decentralized social network, is taking baby steps towards opening up to the public. CEO Jay Graber <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/12-21-2023-butterfly"><ins>announced</ins></a> this week that Bluesky posts are now viewable whether a person is logged in or not, meaning you can directly share content with your friends who don’t have Bluesky accounts. While Bluesky has about 2.6 million users so far, that pool is still relatively small as it remains closed off to wider public signups.</p>
<p>The new public web interface, which <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/bluesky-hits-2-million-users-and-will-soon-release-a-public-web-interface-062757340.html"><ins>the company teased last month</ins></a>, will make Bluesky posts accessible to a bigger audience. To mark the shift, Bluesky has also adopted a blue butterfly as its new logo — gone is the stock photo-style cloudy sky. “Like a butterfly emerging from i

<p>It's Christmas Eve Eve, so I've phoned in this week's TMA and shouted &quot;Lost In Space!&quot; to myself. What a time to be alive. I'm also stoking the flames of the console wars in 2023. Yes, Sony announced its sold <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-has-sold-50-million-ps5-consoles-over-three-years-145835145.html">50 million PS5</a> consoles so far. Xbox doesn't offer its own official figures (because of this eventuality?) but analysts say, during this year, Sony outsold Microsoft consoles three to one.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There's also an outright ban on Apple Watches — at least the two newest models — over patent issues. Apple needs President Biden <em>himself</em> <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-apple-watch-ban-is-here-why-apple-is-no-longer-selling-the-watch-series-9-and-watch-ultra-203706971.html">to turn the ban around,</a> but it doesn't look like he wi

<p>Apple has been noticeably missing in the list of companies with their <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-is-reportedly-developing-its-own-generative-ai-chatbot-to-rival-chatgpt-174507671.html">own generative AI product</a>, but based on a new report by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/22/technology/apple-ai-news-publishers.html"><em>The New York Times</em></a>, it's looking to change that real soon. In recent weeks, Apple has reportedly started negotiating with major publishers and news organizations to ask for permission to use their content to train the generative AI system it's developing. The company doesn't expect to get its hands on their content for free, though, and<em> The Times</em> says it's offering them multi-year deals worth at least $50 million for access to their news archives.</p>
<p>Apparently, some of the publishers it approached are concerned about the repercussions of letting Apple use their news articles throughout the years. They think a broad l
