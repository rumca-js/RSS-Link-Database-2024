Though we\u2019ve hardly seen the end of Luke Skywalker and Anakin Skywalker, and that there will not be a Star Wars movie in 2024, Star Wars Disney Plus offerings will be plentiful. We\u2019re discussing the state of Star Wars: 2024 and outlining all the new Star Wars in 2024 you have to look forward to, especially some new Star Wars series. 2024 will actually have a lot of Star Wars Disney Plus Series, trailer footage shows, starting with a new series set in the galaxy of Star Wars. Jude Law, trailer footage proves, will be a central figure, and next year will also introduce us to The Acolyte. 2024 will explore other parts ofStar Wars, which is long-needed, and hopefully Star Wars Outlaws satisfies as a game that touches all over the the galaxy. There\u2019s much more!
