But why? What was it about Alan Wake that made me Alan Want to give it an Alan Whirl? And what kept me hooked even after I faced down terror after terror?", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/videos/how-alan-wake-ii-made-me-face-my-fear-of-horror-games/2300-6463143", "date_published": "2023-12-26T18:00:00+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "GameSpot", "album": "GameSpot", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null, "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "2023 Was A Great Year For Streaming Animation", "description": "<p><h2>2023 Was A Great Year For Streaming Animation</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4235272-blueeyedsamurai.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Tons of animation releases every year; it's impossible to watch it all even when someone isn't <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hbo-max-dumping-36-more-titles-shows-like-infinity-train-may-disappear-entirely/1100-6506608/\">removing shows from streaming entirely</a> to nudge their bottom lines.

If I had to pick a moment where it clicked into place, it'd have to be when the protagonist, Jala, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PH2WP4G-WhY&amp;ab_channel=AnnapurnaInteractive\">summoned her mother</a> in battle. Early in the game, you encounter Sergio, Jala's third-grade ex, who has been working deceptively hard in her absence to ingratiate himself in her family and life. As you battle in a diner, Sergio becomes invulnerable to your \"thirsty\" skills, backing Jala into a corner. With no moves left, she conjures the one thing that can tear a person down in an instant: her own mother. A projection of her mother towers over the arena before slamming Sergio with a chappal. The psychic damage is done, he is emotionally scarred and vulnerable enough to be defeated in battle.</p><p dir=\"ltr", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/2023s-best-games-broke-down-cultural-barriers-2024-seems-poised-to-continue/1100-6519930/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-12-26T13:00:00+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "GameSpot", "album": "GameSpot", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null, "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Best Of 2023: Disney Dreamlight Valley's Simple Gameplay Hides A Complex Storyline", "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Disney Dreamlight Valley entered early access at the end of 2022, and the Animal Crossing-meets-Mickey Mouse gameplay immediately caught on in my house.

However, throughout the past year, the writers at Gameloft not only exceeded that expectation, they did so with a real and raw look at childhood, adulthood, and the transition between the two. It was a bold choice--and definitely one that flies in the face of \"life simulator starring Mickey Mouse and friends\"--but it's a tale I've routinely thought about since completing it.</p><figure ", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-dreamlight-valley-simple-gameplay-hides-a-complex-storyline/1100-6519913/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-12-26T13:00:00+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "GameSpot", "album": "GameSpot", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null, "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}]
