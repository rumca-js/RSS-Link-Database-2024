<p>What a time for Rasmus Højlund to break a 14-match Premier League duck: on 82 minutes, his left-foot volley pinballing in off Emiliano Martínez’s right post to bring sheer delight to the young No 9.</p><p>It caused relief for Erik ten Hag too and began the Sir Jim Ratcliffe-era of partial ownership of Manchester United in precisely the same fashion that preceded it: breathless and chaotic.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/dec/26/manchester-united-aston-villa-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Setting up is a pain, packing up is even worse – while there are moments of exploration and relaxation to be found, you really have to earn them</p><p></p><p>Even if you’re <em>sure </em>you’d <em>hate</em> camping, I recommend you try it at least once. Because after camping, you’ll notice aspects of every other holiday will have elements of luxury, from packing and unpacking to showering and sleeping.</p><p>I can’t remember my first camping trip. I grew up with a mother committed to ensuring her children saw as much of their home state as possible, even if this involved excessively long drives to the middle of nowhere. I was also a Brownie then a girl guide. I liked camping, I had friends who liked it, later I married a guy who liked it, and we had kids who did too.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/21/sign-up-for-five-great-reads-guardian-australias-wrap-of-our-best-summer-stories">Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads</a></

The registrar at St Pancras had had about fifty weddings this week, but not one application for his services on Christmas Day, and the registrar in the far east said that they had never held a Christmas wedding.

That explained why it was that this morning along the length of Whitechapel and Mile End Road one passed carriages
