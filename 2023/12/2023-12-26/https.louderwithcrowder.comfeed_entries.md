A lot was said in order to convince people that for the first time in history, humans would have to be tested in order to know if they were “sick.” For the first time known to man, we quarantined healthy people. </p><p>In order to try and make those statements sound like there is some sense in them, even more, unhinged justifications were made to convince the masses that the invisible sniffles might kill the masses. Someone who was run over by a truck who was otherwise “asymptomatic,” was not killed by the big rig truck, but rather by the invisible sniffles that became a thing during the Panny D. </p><p>When you become so unhinged, to the level that you convince people that they are de facto

The two often go hand-in-hand. When you have more Democrats running a place, you subsequently get more rats. Where the left goes, rats go. It is just the way the cookie crumbles. </p><p>That is why a group of rats is called a “mischief.” Rodents cause problems. Democrats cause problems. There is no difference between the two. They are the same thing. </p><p>Rats are social creatures. They don’t tend to leave their colony. So when Democrats start fleeing Democrat-run areas, other rodents start to question why their fellow mischiefs are leaving the pack. </p><p>NYC Mayor Eric Adams has stated the obvious. New Yorkers are fleeing The Empire State because of rats. Except when he speaks about vermin, he means rodents. Not Demo-rats.</p><blockqu

</p><p>What is that word to describe someone who believes that skin color is the most significant thing about a person and it subsequently controls their worldview? Oh yeah…it’s called a “racist”. </p><p>We all know universities are the breeding ground for DEI initiatives.

</p><p>As Joe Biden was leaving for Christmas break on Saturday, his staffers weren't paying attention and he attempted to answer a few questions from the media. One on the economy telegraphed the Biden 2024 campaign message: "The fundamentals of the economy or strong, but the media won't report on it the way we want them to."</p><p>There's something that's totally adorable at Democrats complaining about the media not being helpful ENOUGH to them.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

On October 8th, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/harvard-israel-hamas-protest" target="_blank">demonstrators started waving Palestinian flags in support of Hamad doing so</a>.

It was hard to hear because the audience was booing pretty loud. The demonstrators could have b
