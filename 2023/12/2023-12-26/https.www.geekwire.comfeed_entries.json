In an email to Prime subscribers on Tuesday, Amazon said the addition of limited advertisements during Prime Video movies and TV shows will allow the company &#8220;to continue investing in compelling content and keep increasing that investment over a long period of time.\u201d Amazon first announced the change was coming on Sept. 22, as it followed other streaming platforms such as Disney+, Netflix and Max, in offering ad-supported tiers. Netflix resisted advertising for years before finally caving as subscriber numbers&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2023/ads-coming-to-amazon-prime-video-movies-and-tv-shows-starting-jan-29/\">Read More</a>", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2023/ads-coming-to-amazon-prime-video-movies-and-tv-shows-starting-jan-29", "date_published": "2023-12-26T21:20:28+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "GeekWire", "album": "GeekWire", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://www.geekwire.com/wp-content/themes/geekwire/dist/images/geekwire-logo-rss.png", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed/", "title": "Interview: Why Valve launched a new version of its handheld Steam Deck device", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"945\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/20231220_135634-1260x945.jpg\" width=\"1260\" /><br />Valve Software dropped a surprise last month when it unveiled a new version of its handheld PC gaming device, the Steam Deck OLED. After launching the original Steam Deck in February 2022, the team at Valve, based in Bellevue, Wash., had a running list of improvements it wanted to make, and it didn&#8217;t want customers to wait for a true second-generation Steam Deck. That was a takeaway from a recent conversation GeekWire had with Lawrence Yang, a longtime designer and artist at Valve, who talked about the decision to launch a new version of the Steam Deck and lessons learned&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2023/interview-why-valve-launched-a-new-version-of-its-handheld-steam-deck-device/\">Read More</a>", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2023/interview-why-valve-launched-a-new-version-of-its-handheld-steam-deck-device", "date_published": "2023-12-26T18:31:05+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "GeekWire", "album": "GeekWire", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://www.geekwire.com/wp-content/themes/geekwire/dist/images/geekwire-logo-rss.png", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed/", "title": "AI could make us conversant with critters,  unlocking conservation tools \u2013 and serious risks", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Copy-of-Mother-and-Calf-Humpback-Whale-Megaptera-novaeangliaein-Tonga-photo-credit-Katie-Zacarian.jpeg\" width=\"1080\" /><br />My whippet Roxy is smart. She understands dozens of words and phrases well beyond sit and stay. She&#8217;ll &#8220;go find dad&#8221; when commanded and run to the window when asked &#8220;who&#8217;s here?&#8221; So a couple of years ago I bought these big, paw friendly buttons that play a recorded word when pressed.
