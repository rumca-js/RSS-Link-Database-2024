		While Colombia may be famous to the rest of the world mostly for its coffee, the Latin American country may soon have another export – its digital identity.

Since November 2020, the Colombian government has been equipping citizens with a new physical identity card alongside a digital extension on smartphones, relying on biometric authentication. The digital ID has been bringing disruption to the citizens' relationship with the corporate and with the public sector, says Borja Carreras, President of digital identity provider Gestión de Seguridad Electrónica S.A. (<a href="https://gse.com.co/">GSE</a>), the company behind the app.

“We are closing a big gap in Latin America with the solution,” Carreras told <em>Biometric Update</em> in an interview on the sidelines of t

		One of the oft-cited advantages of using biometrics for verification and authentication is that they are unique to a person’s body and therefore more stable and difficult to steal than physical ID documents. But bodies change over time: even someone who never loses their passport is certain to lose their youth.

Biometric identification methods rely on matching a <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202205/biometric-template-explainer">biological signature</a> made up of measurements converted into vectors with a registered copy of that signature. But the temporal persistence or stability of biometrics varies by modality. As a wide variety of biometrics and digital identity applications become increasingly integrated into daily life, it is worth considering how prov

		The provision in the U.S. that seems to be the biggest stumbling block for states trying to enact comprehensive biometric privacy laws is private right of action.

More state legislators were attracted to the issue of biometric privacy rights in 2023 than ever before, but many proposed bills have stalled or died in committee. All of those efforts carried core language first written in the state of Illinois <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202310/bipa-anniversary-marked-with-proposals-for-improvement-close-examination">15 years ago</a> when the landmark comprehensive Biometric Information Privacy Act became law.

In 2023, travel reached <a href="https://www.tsa.gov/news/press/releases/2023/11/13/tsa-prepared-more-travelers-airport-security-checkpoints-expects">levels</a> we hadn't seen since before the pandemic. More travelers than ever are moving through security lines, also bringing increased wait times. Now, it’s up to government administrators like TSA to ensure safe, secure journeys, while also catering to customer needs like speed and seamless check-in.

It’s time to accept that our current travel credentialing system is outdated. Some documents, like our passports, we have for 10 years, which is a long time to go wi
