  <p id="99GMpN">It’s been a fantastic year for the Nintendo Switch. We got new <em>Super Mario</em> games, some great remasters, ports of a few games that previously blew up on PC, and, of course, an absolutely massive sequel to <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>.</p>
<p id="zvpCNI">Even though the Nintendo Switch’s successor is likely just around the corner, there’s no shortage of great games to play on the Switch you might already own. Nintendo can take all the time it needs to launch its next console; whenever that comes out, I’ll probably still be working through quests in <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>.</p>

  <p id="r5KxBf">I am a Paramount Plus apologist. I know — going by subscription numbers alone — that I have to be because people do not subscribe to the streaming service at the same rate as Netflix or Amazon Prime, but I spend more time in the Paramount Plus app than the other two. It’s got older shows like <em>Star Trek</em>, <em>Frasier</em>,<em> </em>and <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em>, and newer splashy shows like... everything Taylor Sheridan produces and <em>Frasier</em>. It has a whole mess of football (American) and football (the rest of the world), and while bigger brand
