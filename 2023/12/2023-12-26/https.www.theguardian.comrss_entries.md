<p>At the end of a thrilling match that displayed the best the Championship has to offer, there was nothing to choose between the division’s two standout teams. On any other day, the performance of both sides would have overrun virtually every team in the league. But these are no ordinary second-tier sides. And so a 1-1 draw felt entirely appropriate.</p><p>For so long in this breathtaking encounter it looked as though Leicester would cling on to victory courtesy of Stephy Mavididi’s wonderful first-half strike. But, after countless waves of Ipswich attack, the hosts procured a late equaliser when the hosts procured a late equaliser when Sam Morsy’s long-range effort took a double deflection off Ricardo Pereira and Jannik Vestergaard, before looping into the Leicester net.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/dec/26/ipswich-leicester-championship-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The big seven firms are weighted as much on global indices as all Japanese, British, French, Canadian and Chinese companies</p><p>In the old days, there were the FAANGs, the five big US tech stocks that dominated the investment landscape – Facebook (now Meta), Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google (now Alphabet). That picture is now out of date. Say hello instead to what is variously called the Super Seven or the Magnificent Seven – four of the above (the dropout being Netflix) plus Microsoft, Tesla and the chip-maker Nvidia. This group’s domination is the stock market story of 2023.</p><p>The chart below is “one for the ages”, says Duncan Lamont, the head of strategic research at the fund manager Schroders. It shows how, even if you invest via one of the broadest and most widely used “global” stock market indices, you will end up with a portfolio that is very American and very skewed towards US tech.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/dec/26/the-stock-market-story

<p>Fairer, greener taxation is possible but first we have to dispel myths that surround the debates</p><p>Let’s be honest: no one likes to pay taxes. Most of us do it (reluctantly) because we understand that at their core is the concept of pooling: we all contribute, so that public services are there when we need them. So that we get healthcare when we are ill, so that there is someone at the end of the line when we report a crime, so that our kids get a good education. If we feel that these services function well, our tax morale – the technical term for our willingness to pay taxes – tends to be high. When we don’t, our willingness to pay decreases.</p><p>When waiting times for adequate healthcare run into years, when schools close because of a lack of safe facilities, when you report a crime but no one comes, the allure of the tax cut – always there, always present – becomes nearly irresistible. The little devil on top of your shoulder is telling you that taxes are too high already

Will it?</p><p>Donald Trump’s packing of the supreme court, to which he appointed three members, to create a reliable conservative majority, has been hailed by the right as his greatest achievement. The Wall Street Journal editorial page has stated that the most important prospect of a second Trump term would be his appointment of federal judges in their mold. But Trump’s candidacy for that second term now poses an existential threat to the legitimacy of the court’s conservative majority.</p><p>The decision earlier this week by the Colorado supreme court disqualifying Trump from the state ballot strikes at more than Trump’s eligibility. It cuts to the core of the ideological doctrines of originalism and textualism that underpin the conservative majority’s entire jurisprudence.

<p>Morocco and Benin will debut pavilions at the international exhibition in 2024 alongside Nigeria’s second showcase, as African artists, designers and film-makers ‘bulldoze’ their way on to the global stage</p><p>Few countries in Africa have been leading the charge in the contemporary art scene like Nigeria. In 2024, as Africa aims to buck the decades-long trend of under-representation at the Venice Biennale, all eyes will be on the west African country for its ambitious second-ever national pavilion, along with first-time participants Benin and Morocco, whose presence has been hailed as “a milestone for the continent”.</p><p>Aindrea Emelife, the 29-year-old curator of the Nigerian pavilion, doesn’t take the responsibility lightly. “It is extremely important – for Nigeria, for Africa.

## Feminism, folk horror and an outsider hero: how I brought Agatha Christie’s Murder Is Easy to the small screen

<p>While some viewers prefer screenwriters to remain faithful to a beloved book, as a 21st century woman of colour I make no apology for which parts of the novel spoke to me</p><p>Agatha Christie adaptations are an annual Christmas tradition, as is the nervous anticipation of viewers sitting down to witness the snipping and streamlining of another beloved novel to fit the screen. This year my adaptation of Christie’s relatively little-known 1938 Murder Is Easy joins the ranks of this murderously festive family fare.</p><p>The original Murder Is Easy sees Christie experimenting with form and themes, class and gender commentary, even some Wicker-Man style folk horror in a darkly romantic comedy with as much seduction as deduction. Murder Is Easy is not a Marple or a Poirot. Fitzwilliam and Bridget, the two-hander’s screwball heroes, aren’t even detectives, let alone iconic ones, but no doubt the book will have its aficionados for whom my interpretation is an irritating interference.

In the Mathison/Spielberg classic from 1982, the visiting extraterrestrial found safety within the secret world of children, whose existence is beneath the grownups’ notice. Now the space alien finds himself protected by old people, who are used to being patronised and ignored.</p><p>Chief among the alien’s allies is Milton, played by Ben Kingsley, an ageing widower in whose back garden his spaceship crash-lands, and who, with instinctive neighbourly kindness, welcomes the mute, hairless naked interplanetary creature into his house. Milton has dementia, and so when he tells locals that he is having to get extra food in for the alien, no one pays much attention other than to relay this apparently sad and upsettin

But she also saw strength, community and unity.

Everyone has heard of this Chinese city now, thanks to coronavirus, but back then the name meant nothing to much of the world.

Nothing could have prepared me for the heat and humidity of a Wuhan summer, and the odour of fermented tofu deep-frying outside the university gates at 7am certainly took a while to get used to. Ten months later, however, I’d got over the culture shock and was feeling very much at home. I’d made some friends, knew my way around and had one Chinese pop song in my karaoke repertoire. Life was good.</p><p>But at 25 I’d never spent Christmas away from England, and the realisation that this was going to be very different hit me hard.

<p>The musician, activist and writer’s lo-fi superhero drama I’m A Virgo is so radical it’s the epitome of anti-Marvel.

You make it a little janky and jangling and people feel it more.” Among this year’s slick small-screen dramas, Riley’s I’m a Virgo sticks out like its main character: a 13ft-tall Black teenager. The premise alone is outlandish enough; what Riley and his team do with it, and how they do it, make I’m a Virgo one of the most bracingly original things on our screens this year or any other. And one of the most revolutionary: the show culminates in a full-on, top to bottom critique of capitalism – in a show streaming on Amazon.
