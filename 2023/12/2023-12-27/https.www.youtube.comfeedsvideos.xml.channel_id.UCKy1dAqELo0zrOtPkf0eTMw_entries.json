It's possible, and practical, that Metroid Prime 4 will launch simultaneously with the new Switch and its predecessor. The same can be said for Mario's latet foray into the 3D space. It's now been six years since the release of Super Mario Odyssey. We are certainly overdue for the plumber's next core adventure, especially on the heels of the very successful Super Mario Bros.
