Thanks to all of you wild viewers (and all the tame viewers too) for allowing us to make so many great videos this year. In 2023, our channel hit 1.5 million subs, we got to interview Elon Musk again, and we had video cameos by Dean Cain, Kevin Sorbo, Kirk Cameron, John MacArthur, and JP Sears. But most importantly, we debuted J. Travis Woodside as The Gender Fairy in a video so consequential, that it did not make this compilation.

What was your favorite Bee sketch this year? Was it the Sizzler tribute? Leave your answer in the comments below. Or else.
