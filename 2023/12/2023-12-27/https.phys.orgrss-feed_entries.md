Christmas, we're told, is the most wonderful time of the year. For many of us, however, it is preceded by one of the least wonderful times: the awkward social spectacle of the office Secret Santa or Kris Kringle, where employees agree to purchase a gift for a randomly allocated colleague.

One of the most significant constraints on the size of objects placed into orbit is the size of the fairing used to put them there. Large telescopes must be stuffed into a relatively small fairing housing and deployed to their full size, sometimes using complicated processes. But even with those processes, there is still an upper limit to how giant a telescope can be. That might be changing soon, with the advent of smart materialsâ€”particularly on a project funded by NASA's Institute for Advanced Concepts (NIAC) that would allow for a kilometer-scale radio telescope in space.

Polarization is one of the fundamental characteristics of electromagnetic waves. It can convey valuable vector information in sensitive measurements and signal transmission, which is a promising technology for various fields such as environmental monitoring, biomedical sciences, and marine exploration. Particularly in the terahertz frequency range, traditional device design methods and structures can only achieve limited performance. Designing efficient modulator devices for high-bandwidth terahertz waves presents a significant challenge.

As astronomers have begun to gather data on the atmospheres of planets, we're learning about their compositions and evolution. Thick atmospheres are the easiest to study, but these same thick atmospheres can hide the surface of a planet from view. A Venus-like world, for example, has such a thick atmosphere making it impossible to see the planet's terrain. It seems the more likely we are to understand a planet's atmosphere, the less likely we are to understand its surface. But that could change thanks to a new study accepted for publication in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astrophysical Society and available on the arXiv preprint server.

Missions focusing on small bodies in the solar system have been coming thick and fast lately. OSIRIS-Rex, Psyche, and Rosetta are all examples of projects that planned or did rendezvous with a small body in the solar system. But one of their biggest challenges is understanding the gravity of these bodiesâ€”which was especially evident when Philae, Rosetta's lander, had a hard time staying on the surface of its intended comet. A new idea from researchers at the University of Colorado Boulder and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory could help solve that problemâ€”by bouncing small probes around.

Mental representations play a crucial role in shaping attitudes and behavior. Children's representations of 'nature' can be assessed along several dimensions, including aspects such as level of wildness, cognitive complexity, degree of elaboration, emotional expression, and representational style. However, understanding children's representations of nature, especially among preadolescents with limited verbal narrative skills, remains a challenge.

Erosion of Earth's topography entrains sediment in rivers flowing across mountains, canyons and other naturally steep landscapes within the catchment. This silt, sand and gravel is transported variably by suspension in the water column, bouncing along the river bed (saltation), or rolling larger pebbles (traction). With a deceleration in water velocity, and therefore carrying capacity, as topography flattens, this material is deposited in a fan shape at the mouth of the river on the shallower plain of the break in slope, becoming progressively finer-grained with distance from the source.

On 15 December, the Large-Sized Telescope (LST) Collaboration announced through an Astronomer's Telegram (ATel) the detection of the source OP 313 at very high energies with the LST-1. Although OP 313 was known at lower energies, it had never been detected above 100 GeV, making this the LST-1's first scientific discovery.

Locals watched in awe as a fireball exploded and hundreds of meteorite fragments rained down on the city of Tatahouine, Tunisia, on June 27, 1931. Fittingly, the city later became a major filming location for the Star Wars movie series. The desert climate and traditional villages became a huge inspiration to the director, George Lucas, who proceeded to name the fictional home planet of Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader, "Tatooine."

The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) needs specific types of magnets to tightly control the beams of particles at its collision points. Called final-focusing quadrupoles, these magnets are installed in the LHC's interaction regions around the experiments. For the high-luminosity upgrade of the LHC (HL-LHC), the final-focusing magnets at ATLAS and CMS will need replacing. Tests at CERN have now confirmed that the quadrupole magnets newly designed to replace them will work.

The oceans are still the most underexplored part of our planet. Diversity of large organisms in the Arctic Ocean has been investigated in many ways, yet research on the diversity of Arctic microorganisms is lacking. One of the problems, apart from inaccessibility, is obtaining high-quality microbial DNA: when working with natural samples, DNA often degradesâ€”it is obtained in low quantities and can contain inhibitors that interfere with sequencing.
