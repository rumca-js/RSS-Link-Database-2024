Walled Culture has written numerous posts about the promise and problems of&#160;open access. An&#160;important editorial&#160;in the journal&#160;Web Ecology&#160;raises an issue for open access that I’ve not seen mentioned before. It concerns the fraught issue of rebuttal articles, which offer fact-based criticism of already-published academic papers: Critical comments on published articles vary in importance; they can [&#8230;]

When law enforcement officers screw up, it&#8217;s always someone else&#8217;s fault. It&#8217;s the lack of trust or support for police officers, something that has steadily declined in the last half-decade. It&#8217;s a lack of funding, even though law enforcement agencies have rarely seen their budgets cut. It&#8217;s people emboldened by accountability efforts. It&#8217;s the hundreds [&#8230;]

One reason that &#8220;right to repair&#8221; reform has such broad, bipartisan public support is because there&#8217;s really no aspect of your daily life that isn&#8217;t touched by it. The effort to monopolize repair isn&#8217;t just the territory of Apple or game console makers like Sony and Microsoft. The problem is present in everything from the [&#8230;]
