Who is involved?&#160;The suit, filed on Dec. 22, names ARMLS, Metro MLS and MLS Aligned as defendants. The Arizona and Wisconsin MLSs, along with five other MLSs, are part of the&#160;MLS Aligned network&#160;that serves tens of thousands of agents across the country.

The suit, filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan, accuses OpenAI and Microsoft of “using The Times’s content without payment to create products that substitute for The Times and steal audiences away from it.” “Defendants seek to free-ride on The Times’s massive investment in its journalism,” the complaint says, as reported by The Times. OpenAI, makers of ChatGPT, and Microsoft have yet to respond to the legal action.

It may soon be applied to actual gameplay. A recent example came earlier this month from the Seattle-based creators of the popular social app Rec Room, which debuted Fractura, an in-game room created as a &#8220;research project&#8221; to demonstrate how players can use generative AI to create their own content for Rec Room. The Seattle startup evaluated more than 20 different tools in the process of designing Fractura, such as ChatGPT to develop and iterate on their ideas, including the creation of a&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/how-generative-ai-could-change-the-way-video-games-are-developed-tested-and-played/">Read More</a>

Jay Inslee on tech policy as the state’s Information and Communications Technology (ICT) Sector Lead, a global pandemic upended work and home lives, artificial intelligence smartened up, and tech sector jobs in Washington — which account for 9% of the state’s workforce and nearly 22% of the state’s economy — grew by 33%.&#160; Now, after a stint leading the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory’s Seattle office and a turn at starting a cybersecurity consulting firm, Williams is making the return to public service.
