<p>JAC Motors, a Volkswagen-backed Chinese automaker, is set to launch the first mass-produced electric vehicle (EV) with a sodium-ion battery through its new Yiwei brand. Although <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2012-05-05-sodium-ion-battery-electrode-research-breakthrough.html">sodium-ion battery tech</a> has a lower density (and is less mature) than lithium-ion, its lower costs, more abundant supplies and superior cold-weather performance could help accelerate mass EV adoption. <em>CarNewsChina</em> <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://carnewschina.com/2023/12/27/volkswagen-backed-jac-yiwei-ev-powered-by-sodium-ion-battery-starts-mass-production-in-china/">reports</a> that the JAC Yiwei EV hatchback deliveries will begin in January.</p>
<p>Yiwei is a new brand in 2023 for JAC. Volkswagen has a 75 percent stake in (and management control of) JAC and owns 50 percent of JAC’s parent company, Anhui Jianghuai Automobile Group Holdings (JAG). The Chinese government owns the othe

<p>Researchers from Linköping University in Sweden developed a ‘bioelectronic soil’ that can speed up the growth of plants in <a href="https://extension.umn.edu/how/small-scale-hydroponics"><ins>hydroponic spaces</ins></a>, or farms that grow plants without soil in environments made up of mostly water and a place for roots to attach. After integrating the engineered ‘eSoil’ into the framework where seedlings grow, researchers discovered that sending electrical signals through the soil made plants grow 50 percent more on average.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The eSoil is made up of organic substances mixed with a <a href="https://www.chemeurope.com/en/encyclopedia/PEDOT:PSS.html"><ins>conductive polymer called PEDOT</ins></a>, which can be found in things like <a href="https://xymox.com/blog/history-of-pedot/"><ins>sensors and OLED displays</ins></a>. Eleni Stavrinidou, the supervisor of the study, told Engadget that the soil’s conductivity was necessary for stimulating the plant roots<em>.</em> In t

<p>A federal appeals court in Washington D.C. has allowed Apple to continue importing the Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 models on Wednesday. The court’s decision comes a day after Apple <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-appeals-ban-on-watch-series-9-and-ultra-2-174046101.html">filed an appeal</a> against a decision by the International Trade Commission (ITC) to ban imports of both models of the Apple Watch, which are at the heart of a patent dispute.</p>
<p>The court’s ruling is temporary. It has given the ITC until January 10 to respond to Apple’s motion for a longer-term pause on the ban during the appeals process, <em>Reuters</em> <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/apple-wins-bid-pause-apple-watch-ban-us-appeals-court-2023-12-27/">reported</a>. This means that Apple should be able to resume Apple Watch sales on its website and in Apple Stores in the US, something that the company had stopped doing last week. Both models of the Watch were still unavailable

<p>The <em>New York Times </em>is suing OpenAI and Microsoft for using published news articles to train its artificial intelligence chatbots without an agreement that compensates it for its intellectual property. The lawsuit, which was filed in a Federal District Court in Manhattan, marks the first time a major news organization has pursued the ChatGPT developers for copyright infringement. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/27/business/media/new-york-times-open-ai-microsoft-lawsuit.html"><em>NYT </em>did not specify</a> how much it seeks in payout from the companies but that “this action seeks to hold them responsible for the billions of dollars in statutory and actual damages.”</p>
<p>The <em>NYT</em> claims that OpenAI and Microsoft, the makers of Chat GPT and Copilot, “seek to free-ride on The Times’s massive investment in its journalism” without having any licensing agreements. In one part of <a href="https://nytco-assets.nytimes.com/2023/12/NYT_Complaint_Dec2023.pdf">

<p>It’s been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/video-games-in-2023-acquisitions-layoffs-unions-143037174.html">a terrible year for game developers</a>, but an amazing year for games. 2023 kicked off with a fantastic remake of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dead-space-remake-playstation-5-review-160019905.html"><em>Dead Space</em></a> and the breakout success that was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/pizza-tower-is-the-wario-land--sonic-crossover-i-didnt-know-i-wanted-130022186.html"><em>Pizza Tower</em></a>, and by the end of the year we had dozens more games vying for our attention. There were some missteps along the way — if you'd asked me to predict this list a year ago, I would've mentioned both <a href="https://www.engadget.com/redfall-review-good-enough-for-game-pass-000641521.html"><em>Redfall</em></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/starfield-review-you-will-like-some-of-it-160046067.html"><em>Starfield</em></a><em> —</em> but overall it's been a packed year unusual

<p>It’s been a banner year for the Right to Repair movement as supportive bills are <a href="https://www.engadget.com/new-york-right-to-repair-law-kathy-hochul-184654713.html">signed</a> into <a href="https://www.engadget.com/californias-right-to-repair-bill-is-now-californias-right-to-repair-law-232526782.html">law</a> across the US and abroad. Apple shocked the world, too, as it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-backs-right-to-repair-bill-in-california-072227964.html">backed California’s bill</a> and urged for a countrywide equivalent. In the EU, regulators mandated the use of USB-C as a standard charging socket for most small devices, and are now turning their attention toward anti-repair tactics. But, while the movement’s leaders should enjoy a glass or two of the good stuff, these victories aren’t total, despite how hard-won they were. To misquote Winston Churchill, this isn’t the beginning of the end, it’s very much the end of the beginning.</p>

<p>Microsoft, a notoriously conservative and slow-moving giant, is bringing artificial intelligence right into the heart of Windows. But. after investing a total of $13 billion in ChatGPT-maker OpenAI (and acquiring a 49 percent stake in the process), <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-bet-big-on-ai-in-2023-but-its-ai-future-is-still-unclear-143055721.html">will AI actually make its products better</a>?</p>
<p>Microsoft went to town. Bing Chat officially kicked off its year of AI, while Copilot, assisting with its AI smarts, subsequently launched on Edge, Microsoft 365 products like Word and Powerpoint and eventually Windows 11.</p>
<p>While the AI interactions aren’t perfect, the one constant around AI is that everything is changing incredibly quickly. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-upgrades-copilot-with-openais-gpt-4-turbo-and-dall-e-3-162558170.html">Microsoft has already announced Copilot will be upgraded</a> with the more powerful GPT-4 Turbo and Dall-E 3 m

<p>Apple's designer exodus continues as product design chief Tang Tan is leaving the company and joining Jony Ive's design firm LoveFrom, according to <a href="https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-iphone-design-chief-enlisted-234039030.html?guccounter=1"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>'s Mark Gurman. There, he'll reportedly work on a new artificial intelligence hardware project backed by OpenAI's Sam Altman with aim of creating devices deploying the latest deep learning technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tan was in charge of design for Apple's main products including the iPhone, Watch and AirPods, so his departure leaves a sizable hole. As part of LoveFrom, Tan will act as hardware design lead for the new AI project, with Altman providing the software running underneath. All products are supposedly in the early concept phases, with a focus on devices for the home. None of the parties (OpenAI, LoveFrom or Apple) have commented on the news.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Amazon has started notifying Prime Video subscribers that they have to pay extra if they don't want their viewing experience interrupted by commercials. In an email the company has sent to customers, it said that it will start showing "limited advertisements" with its service's movies and shows starting on January 29. Those who want to keep their accounts ad-free will have to pay an extra fee of $3 a month on top of their Prime subscription or their standalone $9-a-month Prime Video membership.&nbsp;</p>
