## Switch 2 and More Mario: What to Expect From Nintendo in 2024

After the closing of yet another excellent year for Nintendo fans, it's time to look ahead to what Nintendo has planned for 2024. With the rumor mills spinning up for the long awaited Switch 2 or whatever Nintnedo's next-gen console might be called, we speculate, based on rumors and established trends, on just what we can expect in the new year.

The absence of Metroid Prime 4 has been a long discussed issue within the Nintendo community and gaming as a whole. It's possible, and practical, that Metroid Prime 4 will launch simultaneously with the new Switch and its predecessor. The same can be said for Mario's latet foray into the 3D space. It's now been six years since the release of Super Mario Odyssey. We are certainly overdue for the plumber's next core adventure, especially on the heels of the very successful Super Mario Bros. Movie. 

The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is still quite fresh, so it's safe to say we don't expect any brand new Zelda adventures any time soon.
