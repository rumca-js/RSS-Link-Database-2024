It may soon be applied to actual gameplay. A recent example came earlier this month from the Seattle-based creators of the popular social app Rec Room, which debuted Fractura, an in-game room created as a &#8220;research project&#8221; to demonstrate how players can use generative AI to create their own content for Rec Room. The Seattle startup evaluated more than 20 different tools in the process of designing Fractura, such as ChatGPT to develop and iterate on their ideas, including the creation of a&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2023/how-generative-ai-could-change-the-way-video-games-are-developed-tested-and-played/\">Read More</a>", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2023/how-generative-ai-could-change-the-way-video-games-are-developed-tested-and-played", "date_published": "2023-12-27T16:00:00+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "GeekWire", "album": "GeekWire", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://www.geekwire.com/wp-content/themes/geekwire/dist/images/geekwire-logo-rss.png", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed/", "title": "In his return to governor\u2019s office, Joseph Williams wants to make AI part of Seattle\u2019s future", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"862\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Joseph-Williams-Headshot-044-Edit-1260x862.jpg\" width=\"1260\" /><br />In the five years since Joseph Williams advised Gov.
