Big lists can sometimes feel impersonal, and as you know, tastes in games can be very personal. So we wanted to put together another kind of list, something that would show you - on a more personal level - the games that we, the people who write for Eurogamer, really enjoyed this year.</p><p>This brief series of articles will collect the top fives from a handful of different Eurogamer contributors, and we'll publish a handful of them each day for four days. We're not ordering the top fives because it's not really about that this time - ordering things. It's more important for us, here, to give you a sense of why.</p><p>Oh and please fee", "link": "https://www.eurogamer.net/our-personal-top-five-games-of-2023-1", "date_published": "2023-12-27T10:00:00+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "Eurogamer.net Latest Articles Feed", "album": "Eurogamer.net Latest Articles Feed", "user": null, "language": "en-gb", "thumbnail": null, "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}]
