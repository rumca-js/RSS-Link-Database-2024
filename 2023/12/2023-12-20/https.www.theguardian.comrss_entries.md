By “carols”, I don’t mean the jolly background tunes to your Christmas shop, still less the shiny, happy singalong that is Carols in the Domain. It sounds bah humbug but I’m a purist who’s stingy with my limited tears. Those songs won’t make me weep. Trad carols, however, will.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/dec/21/christmas-carols-bring-hope-in-a-hopeless-time-no-matter-well-keep-singing-with-tissues-handy">Continue reading...</a>

Goals from Sam Kerr and two from Erin Cuthbert took them top of Group D in the Champions League.</p><p>This trip to Gothenburg was one final hurdle for Chelsea to overcome before the winter break. They had endured a frustrating evening against the same opposition last week, dominating but lacking execution in a goalless draw at Stamford Bridge. It was an encounter that would have made Hayes’s side wary of complacency. The Swedish team have enjoyed an impressive campaign and came in sitting two points above their opponents.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/dec/20/hacken-chelsea-womens-champions-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

Alas, the US supreme court will likely not agree</p><p><em>“This</em> is how dictatorships are born.” Such was Donald Trump’s response to news that the Colorado supreme court had ruled that the former president is disqualified from holding office and so should be removed from the state’s Republican primary ballot.</p><p>Anytime Trump speaks of “dictatorships” these days we should pay attention. He has all but declared his intention to engage in dictatorial rule should he win in 2024.

<p>After the stalemate came the slaughter. Liverpool, the model of frustration having been held by Manchester United on Sunday, cruised into the semi-finals of the League Cup for a record 19th time with an emphatic destruction of West Ham at Anfield. David Moyes’ visitors were abysmal, their defending a disgrace in the second half, but they were driven to submission by a superb Liverpool display.</p><p>Dominik Szoboszlai’s spectacular opener set the tone for a rampant home victory in which Curtis Jones also excelled with two goals, Mohamed Salah came off the bench to take his usual place on the scoresheet and Cody Gakpo also breached Alphonse Areola’s non-existent defence. Moyes’ wait for a first win at Anfield extends to 21 games, and he never had any hope of arresting that sorry sequence.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/dec/20/liverpool-thrash-west-ham-5-1-to-reach-semi-finals-as-curtis-jones-doubles-up">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The smokescreen generated by recent carbon-offset setbacks should not blind us to the simple truth that we must protect our intact forests and bring back those we have lost</p><p>Some have recently questioned whether forests really are the climate solution they have long been held to be. This is because some emit great quantities of carbon, while the markets set up to finance them have stumbled. But there is <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/">no pathway to a livable climate</a> without saving our intact forests, regrowing some, and finding a more straightforward way to pay for them than carbon offset projects.</p><p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03629-6.epdf?sharing_token=aDKWv5k28lb9qz7nK4ijDNRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0NILaci0q8CXtVe4JKM-xF0Z0ZQpmJpnpSclAjJeIV-vCjviXK_Mb9hvvU5C3CiJVg6fV-bjYVD4wv7oJn2iiSsIt7ZgIq0Wzlc8IsWp8lUWI6Ld44b1C8-SSR5_2cfu7u_D_u1DCIUv8GOpiSo6Mu_SNZUvhyHzAOt1PKUsYDhe07I295NNOEIfJvCM13AiEk%3D&amp;tracking_referrer=www.theguardian.com">A 2021 st

Steeleye Span guitarist whose rock, blues and folk influences became crucial to the band’s success<p>When Steeleye Span ended their most recent tour with a sold-out show at Cadogan Hall in London, they began it with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdQ1B64sCX0" title="">The Green Man</a>, a song about environmental concerns written by their former guitarist Bob Johnson that had been lost for 40 years and never performed or recorded until 2023. It was a poignant reminder of the key role that Johnson, who has died aged 79, played in Steeleye’s lengthy history as a band that took folk-rock to the charts and into large concert halls around the world.</p><p>Johnson was a rock guitarist with a background in blues and folk, and he fused those influences to provide new melodies or arrangements for epic traditional ballads such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7AQpSi2SVg" title="">Thomas the Rhymer</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn8hN0ZKfqs" title="">Long La

<p>Developing countries are right to want to fight illicit financial flows and combat aggressive tax strategies that rob them of cash they need</p><p>It has long been a paradox that the rich countries whose professional services firms are responsible for most of the world’s cross-border tax abuse also write global tax rules. That, pleasingly, may not be the case in the future. Last month, developing countries at the UN won a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/23/un-agrees-global-tax-rules-resolution-giving-developing-nations-greater-say">historic vote</a> to set up a tax convention, over the objections from the body that wields power today – the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), a club of wealthy countries, including the US, the UK and Japan. This is a long-overdue and much-needed change. Poor nations’ ability to feed, educate and provide healthcare to their people is hobbled by illicit and hidden movements of capital worth billions each

But no matter what the courts say, he may still be a winner with voters</p><p>Ten days out from the end of the year, and who could have foreseen the latest Trump plot twist? On Wednesday morning, Americans woke to absorb the fallout from the previous day’s news that Colorado – of all places – had ruled via its supreme court to ban Donald Trump from the ballot in the run-up to next year’s presidential election. There are many sober things to say about this, but in the first instance let’s give way to an unseemly squeal. How completely thrilling!</p><p>Colorado leans Democrat – both its senators are blue – but it’s a western state with large conservative enclaves that is not exactly Massachusetts or Vermont. The decision by the state’s top justices is unprecedented in US electoral history.

In a segment gently mocking the newly-promoted club’s influx of 29 summer signings, one of the presenters did an impersonation of Steve Cooper that involved little more than him talking in a slightly cartoonish Welsh accent and half-closing the lid of one eye. He was subsequently excoriated by the Comedy Police for the heinous crime of “significantly altering his appearance” to belittle the manager in a skit deemed “cruel, crass and incredibly ill-judged”.

<p>Musk is the world’s best accidental salesman for unions, even as his Tesla workers make 30% less than UAW automakers</p><p>In case workers need any additional arguments for why labor unions are good for them, a powerful new argument comes from none other than Elon Musk. Last month at the New York Times DealBook Summit, a gathering of lords of finance and industry, Musk <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/dec/11/uaw-tesla-elon-musk-unions">said</a>: “I disagree with the idea of unions … I just don’t like anything which creates a lords and peasants sort of thing.”</p><p>That the world’s richest human dissed the idea of unions should certainly be seen as a selling point for unionizing.

<p>Load the table with a barrage of indulgent treats in four stages: a cocktail, confectionery, nuts and and cheese, a choice of liqueurs, and a finale of affogato</p><p>Christmas marks the beginning of the year’s end. But dessert – a flaming pudding, wobblicious trifle or aristocratic panettone – need not mark the end of the Christmas feast. Instead, it marks time to relax: to have the first glass too many, to slouch back in a chair, for the children to be at liberty to play. Time to load the table with treats that sustain hours of simply being together. I stage a four-pronged attack on the senses and sensibilities.</p><p><strong>First</strong>, a downbeat cocktail. My weapon of choice here is the boulevardier, a heavy, heady, spirit-laden take on the negroni; it is warming, aromatic with citrus zest, and a perfect way to ease into the evening.

<p>Genius, queer pioneer, influencer: a vivid new biography presents rock’s poet of the shadow self for a new generation</p><p>On the evening of 13 January 1966, the New York Society for Clinical Psychiatry held its annual dinner at a hotel on Park Avenue. On the menu were string beans, roast beef and baby potatoes. The entertainment was less conventional – a local artist named <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/andywarhol">Andy Warhol</a> had been invited to say a few words, but instead put on a multimedia performance with the band he was managing. The Velvet Underground and Nico cranked up the volume and played Heroin (“Because when the smack begins to flow, I really don’t care any more”) and Venus in Furs (“Kiss the boot of shiny shiny leather … tongue the thongs”) while 300 medical professionals and their spouses looked on in tuxedos and gowns. “I suppose you could call this gathering a spontaneous eruption of the id,” one doctor fleeing the scene told the reporter

<p>Acclaimed animator’s unexpected return explores profound pain, relationships and elements of his own past in the company of typically surreal characters   </p><p>The great Japanese animator Hayao Miyazaki recently cancelled the retirement he had announced back in 2013 and wrote and directed this new feature film. In movie terms, it’s the equivalent of Prospero super-glueing his staff back together and carrying on regardless. Does the magic still work?</p><p>Well, I found The Boy and the Heron a mysterious and charming fantasy that circles back to Miyazaki’s classic themes of childhood pain and grief and how these were forged in the fires of the second world war. It also brings home an authorial point that deserves wider discussion: Miyazaki has been influenced by classic English children’s literature. At various times, this reminds me of Lewis Carroll’s Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland and CS Lewis’s The Voyage of the Dawn Treader. The film’s original title How Do You Live? is how

<p>Rodents chewed through wiring, but my insurer insists on dealing with it as several claims, each with a £400 excess</p><p><strong>When various electrical components in my </strong><strong>Volkswagen Tiguan</strong><strong> car stopped working, I discovered rats had chewed through the wiring and insulation in several places. This had caused nearly £6,000 of damage, rendering the vehicle unsafe. Entry seemed to be through an air vent near the boot. I made a claim through my insurer, Aviva, which declared that, as the damage must have happened over a period, it would be treated as seven incidents and seven separate claims. Each claim involves a £400 excess payment. In the event, the repair costs for four of the areas of damage came to less than the excess, so I was expected to foot the £801 bill for these, as well as £1,200 in excess payments for the three other “incidents”.

<p>Athel tamarisk’s hydration trick could inspire methods of harvesting water in parched environments</p><p>Athel tamarisk (<em>Tamarix aphylla</em>) is a shrub that thrives in salty deserts across the Middle East and other regions. A study has discovered that it tolerates such hostile environments using a hydration trick – it “sweats” concentrated salty water from glands on its leaf surfaces, leaving behind a crust of salt crystals. The crystals not only remove toxic salt waste, they <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2313134120">also help the plant absorb moisture</a>.</p><p>The crystals can contain more than 10 types of salt, and many of the crystals simply fall off. But at least one of the salts, lithium sulphate, forms crystals that remain stuck on the leaves, and timelapse video reveals a surprise – the crystals are exceptionally good at swelling with water at night. That moisture is absorbed by the leaves, helped by an adhesive surface that holds on to the wat
