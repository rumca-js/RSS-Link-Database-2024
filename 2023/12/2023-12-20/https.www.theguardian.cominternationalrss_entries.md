It is long overdue – but still won me over</p><p>There weren’t many men visiting Women Dressing Women, the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s new exhibit on female designers through modern history.

It felt like a screening of the Barbie movie inside the Met’s Costume Institute on an early afternoon last week. I saw people of various races, ages and body types let out collective shrieks at an original Chanel little black dress. As I stood in front of a sexy, see-through, white Tory Burch gown, I nodded emphatically when a woman turned to me and said, “I need that for my wedding.” Nearby, one twentysomething complimented another on her Telfar loafers.
