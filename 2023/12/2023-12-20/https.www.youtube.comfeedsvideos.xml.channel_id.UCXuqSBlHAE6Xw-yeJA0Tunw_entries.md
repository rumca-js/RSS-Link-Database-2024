Around every corner, it feels like people are trying to scam you out of your money. But no one tries harder than audio companies. No I'm not talking about, Apple, Sony, Sennheiser or Samsung. I'm not even talking about hi-fi audio companies like Marantz, Bang and Olafson or Adam Audio. I'm talking about the shady companies that exist in the world of audiophile tweaks. The companies that use science-y sounding words to rip you off. So we got our audio aficionado friend Dankpods to come over and join us while we take a look at some of the craziest BS we've ever seen on this channel.
