While plenty of indie and AAA games come out trying to replicate the magic of Dark Souls, Bloodborne, Elden Ring, and the like, it's difficult to truly harness the magic of Fromsoftware in a Soulslike. Lies of P felt like it came out of nowhere, and hit all the right notes.

Dave Klein, aka DaveControl, breaks down the various gameplay elements that help Lies of P truly match the likes of Dark Souls. Not content to be another poor take on the Souls genre, Lies of P masterfully uses animation, its camera, and environmental design to create the exact right, elusive 'game-feel' that so many Souls clones lack.

In this video, Dave goes over the combat design, enemy design, boss design, corpse runs, estus flasks, environmental design, atmosphere, responsiveness, and overall game feel that makes Lies of P match the feeling of playing a Fromsoftware title.
