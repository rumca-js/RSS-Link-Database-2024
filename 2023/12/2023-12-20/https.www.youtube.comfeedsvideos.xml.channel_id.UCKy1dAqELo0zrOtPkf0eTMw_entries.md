According to a new press release, Star Wars The Bad Batch season 3 and Tales of the Jedi season 2 have been confirmed for a 2024 release by Disney. The Acolyte and Skeleton Crew join the expansive list of Lucasfilm shows coming out in the new year, with #StarWars Andor mysteriously missing from the Disney Plus release schedule. It was earlier this year that we got the announcement for Andor season 2 supposedly coming out August 2024. Obviously the writer’s and actor’s strikes played a role in production of the show, as it was reportedly one week away from wrapping production before the strikes kicked off.  Plus Godzilla Minus One is headed back to theaters with a new look. We also have an update on What We Do In The Shadows season 6.

## Pokemon Scarlet and Violet: The Indigo Disk Review

As a DLC, Pokemon Scarlet and Violet's The Indigo Disk is pretty great. The story's a bit weak, but all the activities surrounding it are a blast, including the challenging battles, the new Terarium zone, the BBQ system and its rewards, and all the new benefits of playing cooperatively with friends. It would be an excellent DLC if it wasn't shackled to a game that is still, over a year later, an ugly and broken technical mess.

Jonathan Majors, convicted on criminal charges, signals major shifts for himself and the MCU. Following verdicts in the Jonathan Majors trial seeing Johnathan Majors guilty on counts of assault and harassment, Marvel has dropped the actor. IGN's Kim Horcher breaks down why Marvel Studios should also part ways with Kang the character, as his launch as the next big-bad of the MCU hasn't really gone off without a hitch, plus Marvel has other big name villains like Galactus, Doctor Doom and Magneto just waiting to get into the action.

Disney/Marvel Studios didn’t wait long after the Jonathan Majors trial update to make their announcement they were dropping him. Jonathan Majors, found guilty in a New York courtroom, may signal the end of an acting career. Jonathan Majors, fired by his reputation, is now Jonathan Majors, fired from Marvel. What is Jonathan Majors’ future? Marvel may have planned for what to do about Jonathan Majors, evidence may show, well before the Jonathan Majors court

Now that the Grand Theft Auto 6 trailer has finally dropped, we’re diving deep into the GTA 6 trailer to piece together as much of the GTA 6 map as possible to compare them to their real-world inspirations.

It’s clear that three counties will be featured in the GTA 6 map: Vice Dale County, Leonard County, and Kelly County. Since GTA 6 takes place in Leonida, Rockstar Games’ take on Florida, it will feature many locations familiar to Floridians.  Throughout this video, we’re going to look at all the locations revealed in GTA 6. Vice City is obviously one of them, but there are more if you look closely at all the locations we highlight in this GTA 6 map reveal. While we don’t have the official GTA 6 map yet, we can confirm the GTA 6 map size will be absolutely massive. 

Where is GTA 6 Taking Place?
That’s a great question, we’ve analyzed every frame of this trailer. There is a lot to focus on in this GTA 6 Florida Map such as Vice City and Everglades-inspired swamp areas and more. To

In today's Daily Fix:

Hackers have previously threatened to release private files from Sony's gaming divisions if they weren't paid approximately $2 million USD. Well, Sony did not cough up the cash and now more than a terabyte of data has been released, some of it with very confidential files related to Sony's upcoming games and their deal with Marvel. Looks like, barring some exceptions, Sony has locked up the video game rights to the X-Men for the next decade or so. The deal does not affect other Marvel characters like Blade, who is getting his own game courtesy of Arkane Studios and Microsoft. And speaking of Microsoft, the hack reveals Sony's deep concern over the Microsoft aquisition of Activision Blizzard King. Sony believes it gives Microsoft a distinct advantage in many areas, including mobile and live service games.
