The online retailer, owned by private equity firm Regent, previously told employees on Dec. 7 that it would begin job cuts starting Feb. 7.

But last week it surprised some workers,&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/zulily-lays-off-more-employees-as-website-and-app-remain-offline/">Read More</a>

That changed the weekend of Dec. 2, when they joined 300 college students from the Seattle region at a hackathon hosted at Amazon by transportation analytics company INRIX, in partnership with Amazon Web Services. The team from Seattle University used historical data about traffic, weather, and collisions in&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/these-computer-science-seniors-defied-tradition-to-win-the-first-hackathon-they-ever-entered/">Read More</a>
