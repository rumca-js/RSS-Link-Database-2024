The recent trailer does a better job of demonstrating how it will feel to command each of the four distinct members of the Suicide Squad, but there\u2019s still the niggling feeling there\u2019s something derivative about the game. Something doesn\u2019t work, and this feature aims to outline what that is.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tq9MhHv0u0Q", "date_published": "2023-12-20T16:30:15+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "GamingBolt", "album": "GamingBolt", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/tq9MhHv0u0Q/hqdefault.jpg", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth - 15 Things YOU ABSOLUTELY NEED TO KNOW Before You Buy", "description": "The Like a Dragon franchise \u2013 formerly known as Yakuza \u2013 has been steadily gaining momentum for a number of years now, and after having delivered a couple of spinoff entries in the form of Like a Dragon: Ishin! and Like a Dragon Gaiden, its ready to return with its next mainline instalment. \n\nLike a Dragon: Infinite Wealth will once again turn focus to new series protagonist Ichiban Kasuga, who is joined by his friends \u2013 including longtime Yakuza star Kazuma Kiryu \u2013 on a new adventure that, for the first time in franchise history, will take us outside Japan, to the sunny islands of Hawaii.\n\nWith the RPG now not far away from launch, here, we\u2019re going to go over a few key details that you should know about it.\n\nNote: This video was re-uploaded because the original video had mistakes in it.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PH_P0Lo489k", "date_published": "2023-12-20T13:30:15+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "GamingBolt", "album": "GamingBolt", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/PH_P0Lo489k/hqdefault.jpg", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "15 Games of 2023 That Can Give You OVER 100 HOURS OF GAMEPLAY", "description": "It\u2019s only natural to want as much bang for your buck as possible, so it\u2019s no surprise that longer games that offer more hours of gameplay than others are valued as highly as they are. \n\nOf course, as we\u2019ve seen all too often over the years, bloat and padding and dilution of quality can be major issues with such experiences, but at the same time, when a game that is well-made, boasts an enjoyable core loop, and offers dozens upon dozens of hours of gameplay on top of all that, it\u2019s bound to turn a few heads. \n\nThankfully, we\u2019ve had plenty such games throughout the course of the year, and with 2023 now drawing to a close, here, we\u2019re going to take a look at a few that have stood out to us.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUptd-HfEUY", "date_published": "2023-12-20T09:30:12+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "GamingBolt", "album": "GamingBolt", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/oUptd-HfEUY/hqdefault.jpg", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 52, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 1, "page_rating": 52, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}]
