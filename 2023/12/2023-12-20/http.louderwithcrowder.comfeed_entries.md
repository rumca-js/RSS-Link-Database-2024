When you work, you are owed a wage. That is not a controversial thing. But for one woman working at a Riverdale Waffle House - let's just say she was paid in not the most conventional way. She was acting a bit un-waffle-ly and got caught up in a sticky situation.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

But for you to be that ignorant to think that socialism is a good thing after so many decades, would make you so stupid that you could not even dress yourself. In regards to Bernie Sanders, you are going to have to decide if he is extremely stupid, extremely evil, or a mix of both. </p><p>Sanders proposes a very stupid bill that he claims will help the little guy.
