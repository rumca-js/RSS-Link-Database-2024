Controversial Activision Blizzard boss Bobby Kotick will depart the company on 29th December, it's been announced. 
</p><p>
Kotick's reign lasted 32 years, during which time the company became one of the biggest and most influential video games publishers on the planet. 
</p><p>
His departure this month is not unexpected - Activision Blizzard had previously <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/activision-blizzard-boss-bobby-kotick-to-stay-through-the-end-of-2023">confirmed Kotick's presence only until the end of this year</a> to "ensure a smooth and seamless integration" following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-has-finally-bought-activision-blizzard"> Microsoft's long-winded but ultimately successful $68.7b

To figure out optimised settings, I'll discuss the game's PC user experience, compare the game against the PS5 version for some performance optimisation hints and evaluate some of those 'Unobtainium' settings intended for future hardware. </p><p>Before I get into the settings themselves, let's talk about the user experience on PC - as it's a highlight of Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora. The first thing you'll notice is that the game doesn't have a noticeable shader

PlayStation 5 has now sold over 50m consoles worldwide since its launch in November 2020.
</p><p>
Sony announced the milestone today, and said PS5 had passed the 50m mark earlier this month, on 9th December. 
</p><p>
That means PS5 took 160 weeks and 2 days to reach the 50m milestone - just one week longer than PS4, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-says-ps5-stock-shortages-will-stabilise-and-sales-return-to-ps4-era-momentum-by-2024">despite severe sales constraints</a> for much of its early lifecycle.

Suika Game, the hit viral puzzler where you drop fruits into a container and combine them, looks set to be getting a release on PlayStation per a recent product page.
</p><p>
This page has raised some eyebrows, however, as the game is listed there as <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10010057">"The Suika Game"</a> and not "Suika Game". The game's original developer is also not mentioned.
</p><p>
The original Suika Game was developed by Aladdin X and, so far, it has only been released on the <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Suika-Game-2468543.html">Nintendo eShop</a>, though many browser versions and clones on other platforms have since popped up.

BioWare and Mass Effect veteran Mac Walters has discussed his reasons for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-veteran-mac-walters-leaves-bioware-after-19-years">departing the studio after 19 years</a> to begin work with a fresh team on a new sci-fi franchise.
</p><p>
In an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYaEtNnC9pk">MinnMax</a>, Walters detailed the various factors involved in his departure, from the desire to work on something brand new and not feeling able to within BioWare or EA, to the positive experience of working on the Mass Effect: Legendary Edition trilogy remaster with a small and "scrappy" team acting as a reminder of his early days at the studio and serving as a positive moment to make his exit.

Discussing the Mass Effect: Legendary Edition project, Walters described its a

Instead of talking about a particular part of a game we like, we're going to talk about what we always talk about at this time of year it seems - the games we're going to play during the end of year break.
