<p>A “Compliance Car” is a vehicle designed not to be sold in large quantities but to satisfy rules around range-wide consumption. For instance, makers of enormous, gas-belching trucks may have to offer a thrifty, gas-sipping ride to balance out the emissions numbers. One infamous example is <a href="https://www.astonmartin.com/en-gb/models/past-models/cygnet">Aston Martin’s Cygnet</a>, a rebadged Toyota iQ with a luxury interior that sold for three times the iQ’s price. Now, imagine a company <em>chose</em> to make one of those vehicles intentionally. That’s the best way to describe <a href="https://www.lexus.co.uk/new-cars/lbx/all-new-lbx">Lexus’ new LBX</a>, a small but luxurious, Europe-exclusive city car that you’ll love sitting in while waiting in traffic.</p>
<p>The LBX is a subcompact car based on the same underlying platform (GA-B) as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/toyota-yaris-morphs-brawny-looking-140400587.html">Toyota’s Yaris Cross</a>, its tiny crossover SUV. The Yar

<p>Amazon will no longer sell donkey-skin gelatin to California residents. A <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.wired.com/story/amazon-donkey-meat-ejiao-california-settlement/">report</a> published Wednesday by <em>Wired</em> states the online retailer settled with a nonprofit that filed a complaint, alleging the products violated state animal welfare laws protecting horses. Amazon denied any wrongdoing and disputed the allegations. Still, it agreed to block sales of ejiao, a traditional Chinese medicine made from donkey hide, in the Golden State.</p>
<p>The Center for Contemporary Equine Studies, an organization devoted to protecting horses, filed the complaint in February. It accused Amazon of violating California’s Prohibition of Horse Slaughter and Sale of Horsemeat for Human Consumption Act. The nonprofit argued donkey products should be classified as horsemeat based on the law’s language.</p>

<p><em>Reuters</em> published an explosive investigative <a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/tesla-musk-steering-suspension/">report</a> Wednesday chronicling Tesla's alleged patterns of deliberate neglect and shifting blame onto customers for parts failures. The damning exposé accounts the Elon Musk-led company’s alleged long-running tendency to claim vehicle owners had engaged in “driver abuse,” charging them for repairs over failures caused by parts the company discussed internally as being flawed. The issues are often related to suspension and steering. Externally, Tesla’s portrayal of the problems has ranged from flat-out denial to partial acknowledgment.</p>

<p>Vizio has released a software update for its Home platform across all current models in its lineup, which makes the new interface respond faster than before. The company says TV sets that receive the update will power up twice as fast, while apps will now load instantly. This improvement in speed also leads to quicker switching between apps so that moving from one streaming service to another doesn’t affect people’s viewing experience.</p>
<p>In addition, the latest version of the OS is meant to surface recommendations and return search results in both voice and text formats much faster than its predecessor. The hope is that users would benefit from the upgrade by spending less time looking for content and more time actually watching them. The updated Home platform also comes with a new left-side navigation menu, as well as hierarchy sorting, to make it easier to browse for new shows and movies.</p>

<p>Researchers have developed an AI-powered <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/robot/"><ins>robot</ins></a> they claim can beat the physical marble game <em>Labyrinth </em>faster than humans are capable of. Thomas Bi and Raffaello D’Andrea of ETH Zurich created CyberRunner, which combines model-based reinforcement with the dexterity required to beat a game that requires physical skill, coordination and precision.</p>
<p>For the uninitiated, the aim of the game is to guide a marble through a maze without falling into any holes. The player controls the movement of the ball by rotating two dials, which tilt the board.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>CyberRunner learns through experience. A camera observes the game and an algorithm learns more about it from each attempt. &quot;Based on its understanding of the game it recognizes which strategies and behaviors are more promising,&quot; the researchers say.

<p>When Elon Musk first took over Twitter, those of us in the tech media had all kinds of theories about how the acquisition might bring about the death of the 17-year-old platform.</p>
<p>Some posited  that his inept attempts at cost-cutting would cause irreparable damage to Twitter’s infrastructure or that mass resignations would lead to catastrophic instability. But as is so often the case with Musk, predictions were in vain. Twitter did die this year, but the way it played out was both more boring and more stupid than anyone could have possibly imagined.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Musk killed Twitter by slowly making it useless for those who relied on it for real-time information, by choking off conversations from those not willing to pay, by flooding users’ timelines with spammy blue-check sycophants and renaming the company X.

<p>I’ve always been pretty money-conscious, but I didn’t really get into budgeting until I was in my mid-twenties. “Budgeting” is generous — I <em>thought</em> I was budgeting, but really I was using a crude Google Sheet system to track my expenses every month. I didn’t truly understand the difference between those two things until I started looking into ways to upgrade. It had been working fine for me, but as I got older and wanted to grow my savings, save up for a home down payment and a wedding and generally do more “adult” things with my money, I started to scour the internet for alternatives. I settled on You Need a Budget (YNAB) about four years ago and I’ve enjoyed it so much that I keep using it even after achieving some of those milestones.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.ynab.com/the-four-rules">YNAB Method</a> is an approach to budgeting that resonated with me then and still does today. I won’t belabor the basics here, but put simply, you’re to give every dollar a “job” as

Using Apple’s machine learning algorithms that quickly separate a subject from its background, it extracts pictures of you, your friends or pets (or anything else it detects as the picture’s subject), transforming them into digital decals. It even makes animated stickers from Live Photos to slap onto iMessage chats or Markup tools. Here’s how to create your own.</p>

<p>AI may or may not take people's jobs in years to come, but in the meantime, there's one thing they cannot obtain: patents. Dr. Stephen Thaler has spent years trying to get patents for two inventions created by his AI "creativity machine" DABUS. Now, the United Kingdom's Supreme Court has rejected his appeal to approve these patents when listing DABUS as the inventor, <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/ai-cannot-be-patent-inventor-uk-supreme-court-rules-landmark-case-2023-12-20/"><em>Reuters</em> reports</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The court's rationale stems from a provision in UK patent law that states, "an inventor must be a natural person." <a href="https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/docs/uksc-2021-0201-judgment.pdf">The ruling</a> stipulated that the appeal was unconcerned with whether this should change in the future. "The judgment establishes that UK patent law is currently wholly unsuitable for protecting inventions generated autonomously by AI machi

<p>The European Union <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_23_6763">says</a> three porn sites are now subject to stricter rules under the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/european-union-digital-markets-services-acts-131818075.html">Digital Services Act (DSA)</a>. The bloc has designated <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/pornhub/">Pornhub</a>, Stripchat and XVideos as "very large online platforms" (VLOPs) after determining that they each have an average of more than 45 million monthly users in the EU. As such, the three sites are subject to the same stringent rules as the likes of Facebook, Instagram, X and TikTok.</p>
<p>The European Commission (the EU's executive arm) says VLOPs have until February 17 to comply with the DSA's general requirements. Those include making it easy for users to flag illegal content, prioritizing reports from "trusted flaggers," providing a means of appeal for content moderation decisions, publish

<p>If they feel brave and technically capable, Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 and Z Fold 5 owners can now <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-adds-foldables-to-its-self-repair-program-for-the-first-time-171120939.html">fix their phones</a> through the company’s self-repair service. The do-it-yourself program is also expanding to the Galaxy S23 series, Tab S9 series and the Galaxy Book2 Pro, all in collaboration with iFixit.</p>
<p>Neither the Flip 5 nor the Fold 5 show on iFixit yet, so we don’t know how much repairs might cost. For the sake of estimates, a repair kit for the Google Pixel Fold’s inner screen costs around $900.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
