		In Albuquerque, New Mexico, officials are seeking additional funding to support the city’s real-time crime center, which has seen a number of major surveillance tech upgrades since its inception over a decade ago. While the city credits the system for addressing heightened crime rates, critics worry that police may rely too heavily on the system and have voiced privacy concerns, according to <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/ap/ap-u-s-news/ap-leaders-seek-to-expand-crime-fighting-net-of-cameras-and-sensors-beyond-new-mexicos-largest-city/"><em>The Hill</em></a>.

		With 85 percent of the global population <a href="https://www.bankmycell.com/blog/how-many-phones-are-in-the-world">using smartphones</a>, many digital ID products rely on them for biometric authentication technology.

The board members have decided on a 1-for-18 reverse that will reduce the number of BIO-key common shares from 17 million issued and outstanding to about 931,000.

In February 2023, the Illinois Supreme Court issued its decision in <em>Cothron v.
