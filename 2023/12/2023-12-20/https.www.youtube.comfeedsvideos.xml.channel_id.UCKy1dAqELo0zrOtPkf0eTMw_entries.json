It was earlier this year that we got the announcement for Andor season 2 supposedly coming out August 2024. Obviously the writer\u2019s and actor\u2019s strikes played a role in production of the show, as it was reportedly one week away from wrapping production before the strikes kicked off.\u00a0 Plus Godzilla Minus One is headed back to theaters with a new look.
