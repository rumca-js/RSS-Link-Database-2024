The attacks on generative AI started out claiming that it was all about protecting the creators whose works were being “stolen” in some mysterious way by virtue of software analyzing them. In some cases, that high-minded stance has already degenerated into yet another scheme to pay collecting societies even more for doing next to nothing. But beyond all this [&#8230;]

One of the big, usually misleading, complaints about content moderation is that it’s done out of personal animus or whims, rather than a focus on actually making it so people stop being jackasses on platforms. Indeed over and over again you hear stories about some content moderation decision that people assert way too much thought [&#8230;]

There&#8217;s been plenty of courtroom discussion about Fifth Amendment rights surrounding compelled decryption in recent years. Encryption is on by default on most devices these days. Law enforcement seems to believe all it needs is a warrant to compel decryption. Courts aren&#8217;t so sure. A lot of judicial discussion revolves around the &#8220;foregone conclusion&#8221; doctrine. [&#8230;]

Given just how many terrible state social media laws we keep seeing, it’s nice to finally see one that, conceptually, I agree with, though practically still worry about. NY state senator Brad Holyman-Sigal has introduced a bill to require social media websites to provide an openly accessible API for others to build on top of. [&#8230;]

Hackers gained access to a significant portion of Comcast systems between October 16 [&#8230;]

As Walled Culture has often noted, the process of framing new copyright laws is&#160;tilted&#160;against the public in multiple ways. And on the rare occasions when a government makes some mild concession to anyone outside the copyright industry, the latter invariably rolls out its highly-effective lobbying machine to fight against such measures. It’s happening again in [&#8230;]

To paraphrase Voltaire, I disagree with what you say but I will defend to the death the government&#8217;s right to prosecute you for what you say. That&#8217;s apparently the thought process in Olyphant Borough, Pennsylvania. Marine veteran Dave Bliler lives in this town.
