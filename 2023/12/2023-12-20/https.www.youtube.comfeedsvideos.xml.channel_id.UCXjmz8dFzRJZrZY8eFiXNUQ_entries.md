The Lord Of The Rings is a story about an unlikely hero vanquishing an unimaginable evil by destroying a magic ring. Though the real hero isn't the one holding the ring.  Many fans maybe see Frodo as our main hero, others might see Aragorn as the main focus of The Lord of the Rings.  But our real hero, Samwise Gamgee, is the sole reason the ring made it to Mount Doom at all.  The Lord of the Rings is filled with unlikely heroes, but Samwise is the focal point to the ultimate destruction of the ring.
