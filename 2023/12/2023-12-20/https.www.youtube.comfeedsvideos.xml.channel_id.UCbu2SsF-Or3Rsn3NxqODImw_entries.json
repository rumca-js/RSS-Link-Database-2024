Not content to be another poor take on the Souls genre, Lies of P masterfully uses animation, its camera, and environmental design to create the exact right, elusive 'game-feel' that so many Souls clones lack.\n\nIn this video, Dave goes over the combat design, enemy design, boss design, corpse runs, estus flasks, environmental design, atmosphere, responsiveness, and overall game feel that makes Lies of P match the feeling of playing a Fromsoftware title.\n\nTime Stamps:\n0:00 - Intro\n1:20 - Combat Design\n3:42 - Enemy Combat Design\n5:04 - Boss Combat Design\n6:", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ag2ky5G1q2I", "date_published": "2023-12-20T16:00:03+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "GameSpot - YouTube", "album": "GameSpot - YouTube", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/ag2ky5G1q2I/hqdefault.jpg", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}]
