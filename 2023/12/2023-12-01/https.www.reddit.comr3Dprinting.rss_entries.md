<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Welcome back to another purchase megathread!</p> <p>This thread is meant to conglomerate purchase advice for both newcomers and people looking for additional machines. Keeping this discussion to one thread means less searching should anyone have questions that may already have been answered here, as well as more visibility to inquiries in general, as comments made here will be visible for the entire month stuck to the top of the sub, and then added to the Purchase Advice Collection (Reddit Collections are still broken on mobile view, enable &quot;view in desktop mode&quot;).</p> <p><strong>Please be sure to skim through this thread</strong> for posts with similar requirements to your own first, as recommendations relevant to your situation may have already been posted, and may even include answers to follow up questions you might have wished to ask. </p> <p>If you are new to 3D printing, and are unsure of what to ask, try to include the following in
