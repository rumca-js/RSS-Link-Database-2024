In today's Daily Fix:
One of the most anticipated games in years will finally get a trailer this Tuesday. Rockstar Games has announced a trailer drop for Grand Theft Auto 6 on December 5th, and you can watch alongside us starting at 8:30am ET. In other news, Cyberpunk 2077 is getting another sizeable update. Patch 2.1 makes changes to some of the bosses, including making Adam Smasher more difficult, adding in a working metro system, and more. And finally, Capcom has confirmed they want to make more Resident Evil remakes—they just haven't said which ones yet. Resident Evil 5 makes sense, but the fans want Code: Veronica. What RE game do you want to see remade?

The Walking Dead: Destinies reviewed on PlayStation 5 by Tauriq Moosa. Also available on PlayStation 4, Xbox, PC, and Nintendo Switch.
A boring, ugly mess of a game to be avoided at all costs, The Walking Dead: Destinies fails to do anything interesting with the story and characters of the popular TV show it’s based on. While the ghost of a promising concept haunts the periphery – that of making choices different from what happened i the early seasons of the show and watching them play out – its horrendous graphics, weightless combat, repetitive mission design, and as many bugs as zombies reduce Destinies to the gaming equivalent of a biological hazard.

IGN's Jeffrey Vega and Cheez-It's very own Cheez play through the "Make Your Own Choices" Felicia Hardy (Black Cat) mission in Marvel's Spider-Man 2. Watch Miles thwip and swing through some magical portals and experience one of the best missions in the game (Aside from Howard's - we love you Howard, and your pidgeons too). Anyway, something weird has been happening with Pete, so Miles is stepping in to save the day from villains like Kraven the Hunter. Which when you think about it is a pretty awesome title to give yourself. What should Jeffrey's nickname be?

Oh wait -- Jeffrey's there now, too? What happened to Brian Altano? Has anyone figured out where they are yet? Jeffrey owes me 5 bucks so he better make it out of there. JEFFREY, IF YOU CAN SEE THIS, REPLAY THE MISSION AND TRY TO USE A PORTAL TO ESCAPE the Backrooms. AND PLEASE FIND BRIAN IF YOU CAN! We're all counting on you!!

... I'm never getting those $5 back am I?

Presented by Cheez-It.
