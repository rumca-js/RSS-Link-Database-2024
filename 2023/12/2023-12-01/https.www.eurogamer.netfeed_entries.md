Cast your mind back to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8X2kIfS6fb8">Cyberpunk 2077's E3 2018 trailer</a> and you might remember Night City's metro system playing a prominent role - which was why its absence as a fully functional transportation service was so notable come the game's beleagured release in December 2021. Two years later though, CD Projekt has announced it's restoring the long-absent rideable metro system in a surprise 2.1 update arriving next Tuesday, 5th December.
</p><p>
The 2.1 update coincides with the launch of Cyberpunk 2077's Ultimate Edition (bundling together the base game and Phantom Liberty expansion) and was detailed in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th0_Q8_6UOU">new developer livestream</a>, beginning with a focus on that long-awaited Metro system. "The metro was not in our plans for

Microsoft has cheekily riffed on Rockstar's big <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> reveal trailer release date announcement by teasing a surprise announcement of its own. 
</p><p>
Just over two years after launch, a fresh reveal for Halo Infinite will apparently arrive on Monday, 4th December at 5pm UK time.
</p><p>
The announcement was made this evening by Microsoft via a post on X, formerly Twitter, made to look like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grand-theft-auto-6-trailer-coming-tuesday-rockstar-announces">Rockstar's GTA 6 trailer</a> post from this afternoon. The accompanying image shows the softly-lit silhouette of a Halo ring (rather than palm trees and seagulls).

Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League publisher Warner Bros. Interactive is battling to stop the spread of footage taken from the game's alpha test. 
</p><p>
Leaked videos, as seen by Eurogamer, have revealed the game's lengthy opening, which features a cast of familiar characters in a spoilery location, and gameplay featuring all of the game's characters.
</p><p>
Footage of the game's emote dances has also been posted, as well as the game's skill trees.

## EA Sports WRC: an engine change for the worse?

From the tarmac racing in F1 and Grid to the off-road thrills of Dirt and the more realistic Dirt Rally, it has every base covered. But the times are changing, and so is the technology. In 2020, Dirt 5 switched to an evolved form of the Onrush engine instead - to great success - while this year the launch of EA Sports WRC sees a more radical break with the studio deploying Unreal Engine 4. </p><p>This fascinating transition raises some questions. Have the visuals truly benefitted from the change? In comparison to the likes of Dirt Rally 2.0 - an EGO Engine title that was handled by the very same team in 2019, is the rally experience of EA WRC improved? And how does it run today on P

Developer Rockstar announced the news this afternoon, and anticipation is clearly high. Despite only sharing this small update five minutes ago at the time of writing, the studio's post on X (formerly Twitter) is already awash with some very enthusiastic responses. 
</p><p>
We knew Rockstar would reveal its first GTA 6 trailer at some point in December. Clearly aware fans were eager for any morsel of news about the next game in the studio's hugely successful series, the developer announced last month it would be sharing a trailer in December.

But, since the Pok&eacute;mon franchise is an unstoppable force, fans already knew a new series was on its way in the form of Pok&eacute;mon Horizons. Set in Paldea to tie in with the latest mainline series games Pok&eacute;mon Scarlet and Violet, Horizons follows two new Pok&eacute;mon Trainers - Liko and Roy - on their journeys. Eurogamer attended a screening of the first four episodes of Pok&eacute;mon Horizons this week to take a look.</p><p>Despite primarily taking place in Paldea, Pok&eacute;mon Horizons evokes the original anime straight away by beginning in the Kanto region - as Liko has moved to Viridian City in order to attend a Pok&eacute;mon academy.

</p><p>
A remaster of the PlayStation 1 (and later PSP) game is heavily sought after by fans of the series.

</p><p>
As shared by RebsGaming, the first season of Halo is now available in full as a playlist on YouTube (although, it is only available in certain regions). Included in its description were the words: "catch up before the new season streaming Feb 8th."

This week I've been re-reading Graeme's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/remembering-iain-banks-a-prolific-terrific-talent">wonderful piece on Iain Banks</a> that we published on Tuesday. I've also been thinking about Banks in general, listening to old radio programmes he was on, and wishing that we'd gotten to enjoy his entry on Simon Parkin's podcast, My Perfect Console. That would have been dream broadcasting.
</p><p>
In its place, I realised I had a dim memory of Banks giving an interview to Edge mag about the games he loved, and when I tracked it down I discovered that one of his earliest loves in games was Asteroids. So that's it: Asteroids is our Game of the Week. About time, really. It's a classic. And to keep things topical, play the version on the glorious Atari 50 collection, which is due an end-of-the-year update.

The driving survival game was initially set to release this year, but developer Ironwood Studios made the decision to delay its launch in order to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pacific-drive-survival-game-delayed-to-early-2024">prioritise the team's health and wellbeing</a>.

Originally announced in August 2019, the space combat threequel looks ambitious. When our Bertie took a look last year he dubbed it as having tremendous scale, and being "a space RTS for the James Webb era".
