We&#8217;ve long known the Fifth Circuit is the worst circuit to hear your case involving rights violations by law enforcement. Despite one particularly blistering dissent from Judge Don Willett calling qualified immunity a &#8220;rigged game&#8221; litigants almost always lose, the Fifth Circuit continues to coddle cops and overreaching government officials to give them what they [&#8230;]

This wasn’t hard to predict. When Montana passed its TikTok ban in April we called it “laughably unconstitutional.” Montana’s very silly Attorney General, Austin Knudsen, who claimed to have been the driving force behind the bill, had insisted that the state would be vindicated in court. As we noted when the bill passed, his public [&#8230;]

Most people seem to understand the First Amendment protects their right to say stupid or offensive things, especially when they&#8217;re the ones saying them. These same people often forget the First Amendment does not protect them from counter-speech, during which they may be publicly decried as stupid or offensive. The same goes for most government [&#8230;]

Okay, okay, I think this is the last of my posts about Elon Musk’s unhinged appearance at the DealBook Summit with ill-prepared interviewer Andrew Ross Sorkin. We already covered his cursing out advertisers, while predicting that “earth will judge” them, as well as his statement that AI copyright lawsuits don’t matter because “Digital God” will [&#8230;]

For decades, cable TV giants have nickel-and-dimed customers with a rotating assortment of bullshit cable TV fees, whether it&#8217;s &#8220;regulatory recovery&#8221; fee (a misleadingly named fee designed to have you blaming government for industry greed), regional sports fees (charged whether or not you watch sports), or the completely meaningless &#8220;broadcast TV fee&#8221; (which has ballooned [&#8230;]

One of the more famous, and my favorite, quotations attributed to Winston Churchill is: &#8220;Americans will always do the right thing, only after they have tried everything else.&#8221; My second favorite Churchill quote, by the way, is: &#8220;Dammit, I can&#8217;t decide between these three fingers of whiskey and this tankard of champagne!&#8221; Anyway, the point [&#8230;]
