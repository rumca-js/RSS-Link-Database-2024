Playwright and artist who wrote the BBC series Tutti Frutti and Your Cheatin’ Heart, and plays including The Slab Boys<p>The work of the Scottish painter and playwright John Byrne, who has died aged 83, was all of a piece. His characters and caricatures, on stage or canvas, all stemmed from a sly, literate sense of humour, a close acquaintance with popular culture, and a fierce political independence.</p><p>Byrne himself entered that realm of popular culture with two acclaimed drama series on television after 20 years of hard graft in his studio and in the theatre. Tutti Frutti (1987) was an explosively funny six-part BBC series about a chaotic touring rock band, the Majestics (“Scotland’s Kings of Rock”), led by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/oct/14/robbie-coltrane-obituary" title="">Robbie Coltrane</a>, and whose members include Emma Thompson and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jul/22/maurice-roeves-obituary" title="">Maurice Roëves</a>, with

<p>The fight between two of America’s most powerful governors, billed by Fox as ‘The Great Red v Blue State Debate’, mostly hurt DeSantis</p><p>On Thursday night, Ron DeSantis, the governor of Florida, reminded the US why he will never be president. His voice grates, his visage a cross between a squinted grimace and scowl. He looks like Manuel Noriega, the ex-Panamanian dictator, without the scarring. On a personal level, he lacks humor, warmth, wit, or uplift. He is ham-handed, an awkward social warrior.</p><p>DeSantis comes across as too hot. This is the guy who picked a fight with Mickey Mouse, his state’s largest employer. He holds degrees from Yale and Harvard, but repeatedly flashes clouded judgment. In other words, there are plenty of reasons why he is getting walloped among Republicans by Donald Trump.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/dec/01/ron-desantis-gavin-newsom-debate">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The action film-maker’s first American film since 2003’s Paycheck is a solid, almost entirely dialogue-free revenge thriller that fails to bring us anything new</p><p>It’s been 20 years since John Woo last made an American film – the muddled sci-fi thriller Paycheck – and while he’s been absent as a director, his influence has been ever present. Directors David Letich and Chad Stahelski, whose films Bullet Train and John Wick respectively owe a heavy debt to Woo’s sleek operatic style, even keep a picture of him in their joint office. So in what’s become a boom financial period for the action movie (the Wick movies have amassed over $1bn in total), it makes sense that Woo, commonly seen as one of the genre’s most integral forefathers, would return to reclaim his throne.</p><p>His to-the-point revenge thriller Silent Night isn’t good enough for us to erupt into the applause Woo has so often deserved, but it’s also not bad enough for us to mourn the film-maker that he once was, a mo

<p>Meghna Gulzar’s somewhat episodic biopic of Indian army officer Sam ‘The Brave’ Manekshaw presents him in terms of outright, if charming, heroism</p><p>Sam Manekshaw – AKA Sam Bahadur (“Sam the Brave”) – lived through some extraordinary periods of change. Born into an India ruled by Britain, he joined the army and fought for British-Indian interests against Japan in the second world war. On partition in 1947 he was assigned to a new unit, as his previous regiment was now part of Pakistan’s armed forces. He later oversaw India’s part in the Indo-Pakistani war, which led to the formation of Bangladesh, and became, in 1973, the first Indian army officer to be promoted to the rank of field marshal, just as he retired.</p><p>This historic framework could make a rich basis for a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/may/17/life-death-colonel-blimp-review">Colonel Blimp</a>-style look at how values and politics shift around an individual as they age, but in the event, that’s not

<p>Guardian readers pay tribute to the late Pogues frontman, who soundtracked their childhood, inspired their art and PhDs, and performed some of the most raucous, beer-soaked gigs ever</p><p>Like many who came before me, I made the hard decision to leave the green fields of home for better opportunities across the Irish Sea. I moved to Manchester on my own at the age of 24, where I knew no one. Having grown up listening to the Pogues, their songs were the soundtrack of my childhood with my dad, who videoed me and my siblings’ childhood endlessly, using their music as the backing track. Shane’s songwriting enveloped me in nostalgic warmth and kept me going at the toughest of times, through homesickness, loneliness and guilt.<br /><br />One song in particular resonated with me – Sally MacLennane. It always lifted my mood: “I’d like to think of me returning when I can” played over and over in my mind every time I returned to England and had to say my goodbyes. Although I knew I wasn’t

<p>Stockport-born midfielder has broken through into first team and could be solution to Erik ten Hag’s midfield conundrum </p><p>Amid all the joylessness that can come with being a modern football fan, concerned by takeovers, the cost of attending matches and the inevitability that your club is not as successful as you desire, there is one thing that will always bring cheer: a local academy graduate making an impression in the first team.</p><p>The latest such Manchester United prodigy is the Stockport-born 18-year-old Kobbie Mainoo, who at Newcastle on Saturday night will be aiming to make his second Premier League start. Jesse Lingard, Marcus Rashford and Mason Greenwood have made an impression in the first team over the past decade but it is rare that a local player progresses through the system there, with the majority coming from further afield. Many have enjoyed fleeting appearances but it is difficult to become a regular at the elite level United are trying to operate at.</p>

<p><strong>Theatre503, London<br /></strong>Roxy Cook’s award-winning debut is a whimsical, layered meta-tale about the clash of old Soviet ways and modern, capitalist culture</p><p>This play opens just as the title promises. Two narrators tell us the story of an elderly woman (Giulia Innocenti) from old Russia who is stranded in the new Moscow of 2018 that is still high from hosting the World Cup.</p><p>She is sold a loan with an extortionate interest rate by a callow, morally slippery bank manager (Sam Newton), even though it is intimated that she is in the early throes of dementia and can’t keep hold of the manager’s name. That action spirals into a tragicomedy, of sorts, narrated by characters-cum-storytellers. They restart again and again, it seems, and the drama appears beguilingly simple but gathers Matryoshka doll-like layers.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/dec/01/a-woman-walks-into-a-bank-review-theatre503-london">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Rake up those wet autumn leaves and let them decompose – it’s a free and easy way to enrich your soil</p><p>I moved from a city flat to the countryside as autumn was turning to winter and, unfamiliar with my first garden, was at loss as to what to do. I didn’t know what many of the plants were or what they needed from me, so I resigned myself to a quiet first winter, watching and waiting until spring, when the plants would start emerging again.</p><p>I did give myself one task though, and it’s one well worth doing if you have limited energy for gardening in winter: sweeping the leaves that fell off our willow tree and turning them into leaf mould.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/dec/01/if-you-do-just-one-thing-this-winter-make-some-leaf-mould">Continue reading...</a>

It’s an account of what is to come: houses full of flammable plastic, soil dried out by climate change.

Just don’t forget the baseball cap</p><p>One of the things <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion" title="">fashion</a> does is give us a snapshot of what an aspirational day looks like at a moment in time. Which is another way of saying that the reason lots of people now dress in outfits a bit like the one in this photo – in a way that suggests their plans for the day involve a fitness activity and then grabbing a cup of coffee – is because that is what the good life looks like.<br /><br />I call this look “coffee run clothes”. By which I mean any outfit that you could feasibly wear to go for a run, but is also pleasing enough to stop off at a posh cafe. Coffee run – coffee, and a run, geddit? – is to the zeitgeist what the ladies-who-lunch look was a few decades ago. Back then, a cute skirt suit and kitten heels suggested your day revolved around shopping and pushing a fancy salad around

I got chatting to David Cain, an acquaintance who runs the bedbug control company <a href="https://www.bed-bugs.co.uk/" title="">Bed Bugs Ltd</a>, and told him I needed a job. He offered me work doing the deep cleans after they treated properties for infestations. Two weeks after the treatment, I would go in, strip the bed and do another clean to make sure there was nothing left. I’d clear up any treatment residue, give everything a good scrub, look for eggs, nymphs, and any signs of faecal or live samples.

Showered with plaudits in that time (with comparisons with Miles Davis often among them), Akinmusire shares Miles’ belief that less is more. He called this beautiful trio album Owl Song because his favourite birds’ cool occupancy of their world mirrors this project’s search for space and precious time in a clamorous human habitat he considers “assaulted by information”.</p><p>Akinmusire could have just played Owl Song as an ambient reverie in duo with his legendarily harmonious guitar partner Bill Frisell – but it’s the

And now health advocates are agreeing with us: nutritionist Jenna Hope, author of the new book How to Stay Healthy, is perhaps the most recent to argue that men really do suffer more than women when they’re ill. “When we look at the evidence we find that the female immune system is actually stronger than the male immune system,” <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/is-man-flu-real-cold-symptoms-scientific-research-vq8m6n5qv">she told the Times</a>.

At the northern end of the emirate, the world’s tallest skyscraper, the Burj Khalifa, juts into the atmosphere.

<p>Design from Leicestershire-based company just waiting for green light of approval from governing body World Rugby</p><p>Rugby players of all ages have received the same stern warning for decades. Traditional headguards may protect against cuts and abrasions but they don’t prevent concussions. A scrum cap that can substantially help to mitigate the risk of brain injuries in contact situations on the field, both in training and matches, would be a gamechanger for a sport very much in need of some positive developments.</p><p>Many manufacturers have tried – and failed – to convince the sport’s governing body they have found the answer. Finally, though, there are high hopes of a genuine breakthrough. A Leicestershire-based company called Hedkayse, who initially specialised in cycling helmets, have designed a rugby headguard that, according to data ratified by Imperial College, London, reduces the force of direct head impacts by up to 85%.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport

The key is to remember what they did and hold them to account</p><p>In so many ways, the Covid inquiry feels as if it is going very badly for the Tories. Seemingly every session in the plain, low-ceilinged, rather severe room next to Paddington station in London confirms more of our worst suspicions from the time of the pandemic about the Conservatives’ performance in government. That Boris Johnson, many of his ministers and some of his most senior advisers were disastrously unsuited to dealing with one of the most lethal crises Britain has ever faced is becoming ever clearer, question by question, document by document.</p><p>The lead counsel for the inquiry, <a href="https://3rblaw.com/barrister/hugo-keith-kc/">Hugo Keith KC</a>, sometimes uses phrases such as “failings in the heart of the government” when he is questioning ministers and ex-ministers – and even more ominously for them, when he is summarisin
