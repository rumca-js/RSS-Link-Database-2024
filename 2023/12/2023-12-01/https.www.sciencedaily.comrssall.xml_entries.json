Their findings confirm that a moderate sunspot group triggered one of the largest magnetic storms ever recorded, almost covering the entire night sky with colourful aurorae in both hemispheres. If such an extreme storm occurred today, it would severely disrupt modern technological infrastructure. Their study emphasizes the importance of looking at historical records in light of modern scientific knowledge.", "link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2023/12/231201123714.htm", "date_published": "2023-12-01T12:37:14+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "Latest Science News -- ScienceDaily", "album": "Latest Science News -- ScienceDaily", "user": null, "language": "en-us", "thumbnail": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/scidaily-logo-rss.png", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/rss/all.xml", "title": "Meteorites likely source of nitrogen for early Earth", "description": "Micrometeorites originating from icy celestial bodies in the outer Solar System may be responsible for transporting nitrogen to the near-Earth region in the early days of our solar system.", "link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2023/12/231201123706.htm", "date_published": "2023-12-01T12:37:06+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "Latest Science News -- ScienceDaily", "album": "Latest Science News -- ScienceDaily", "user": null, "language": "en-us", "thumbnail": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/scidaily-logo-rss.png", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/rss/all.xml", "title": "To help autonomous vehicles make moral decisions, researchers ditch the 'trolley problem'", "description": "Researchers have developed a new experiment to better understand what people view as moral and immoral decisions related to driving vehicles, with the goal of collecting data to train autonomous vehicles how to make 'good' decisions.
