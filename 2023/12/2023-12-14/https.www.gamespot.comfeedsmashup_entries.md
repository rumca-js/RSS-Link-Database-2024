<p>Inkay, the small squid Pokemon, has returned in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-scarlet-pokemon-violet/">Pokemon Scarlet and Violet</a> as part of the Indigo Disc DLC, along with its confusing evolution method. This dark/psychic originally appeared on the Nintendo 3DS in Pokemon X and Y with a special method of evolution. In the 3DS version, you had to physically turn your handheld upside in order to get the Pokemon to evolve. This method is similar to how it's done on Nintendo Switch in the Pokemon Scarlet and Violet Indigo Disc DLC, although there are a few additional caveats.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Where to catch Inkay</h2><figure style="width: 1280px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4235849-inkayhabitat.jpg"><img alt="Inkay can be found near beaches and water in the Coastal Biome." src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4235849-inkayhabitat.jpg" /></a><figcaption>Inkay can be found near beaches and water in

<p dir="ltr">The Game Awards is an annual event where the exceptional hard work and dedication of hundreds of developers are ostensibly recognized on the grandest stage that the video game industry has. But it also serves as the place where the future of the industry is teased, with trailers showcasing what's in store for the next few months and years. To make it all happen, there are advertisements played between trailers and awards, while mainstream celebrities appear to try and bring in eyes from beyond our corner of the entertainment landscape.</p><p dir="ltr">The Game Awards is an exciting event that has also been criticized for the balance it strikes between all those objectives and pieces of the show. 2023's event, in particular, has drawn criticism for the lack of time that developers were given to talk when accepting awards on stage, as well as the fact that many developers, games, and teams' achievements were rapidly cycled through as interstitial moments.

<p>One of the most recognizable fictional characters ever, Mickey Mouse, will enter public domain in 2024, but there are some serious strings attached. This only covers Mickey Mouse's first-ever appearance from Steamboat Willie in 1928, not the character's more modern-day appearance.</p><p>A Disney spokesperson told the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/mickey-mouse-public-domain-disney-minnie-tigger-1dbfa3982a172334503bc8cf87302b6f">Associated Press</a> that the "more modern versions of Mickey" continue to be unaffected by the expiration of the Steamboat Willie copyright. Disney added that Mickey will continue to play a "leading role" in Disney's "storytelling, theme park attractions, and merchandise."</p><p>According to US law, a copyright can be held for 95 years, which is why Steamboat Willie's version of Mickey Mouse will enter public domain in 2024. Disney and other companies successfully lobbied Congress to extend the copyright lengths over the years, pushing it to 95 years.

<p>Call of Duty's latest Dune tie-in DLC was just recently announced, featuring the characters Feyd-Rautha and Paul Atreides. But who is better at Call of Duty? The actors who play them, Austin Butler and Timothee Chalamet, have settled the score.</p><p>Activision got the two together in a room to duke it out in a knives-only cage fight on the fan-favorite map Rust. Butler and Chalamet also reflect on how their in-game characters look, with Chalamet remarking that he looks better in the game than he does in real life. There can be only one winner, though, so be sure to watch until the end to see who comes out on top.</p><div>          </div><p>The Paul Atreides bundle is available in Call of Duty now for 2,400 COD Points, or about $20.

<p>Actress Sydney Sweeney plays Julia Carpenter AKA Spider-Woman in the upcoming movie Madame Web, and as it turns out, Sweeney was bitten by a spider in real-life when she was making a different film recently.</p><p>While making the movie Anyone But You in Australia, Sweeney was filming a scene where she's holding a Huntsman spider, and unfortunately for her, it bit her. "They told me it was trained. I don't know how you train a frickin' spider," Sweeney told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmMPZFFDAPY">Jimmy Fallon</a>. When the cameras were rolling, Sweeney started screaming, but the crew apparently thought she was only acting. Her co-star Glen Powell, however, realized it was the real deal and the cameras finally cut.</p><div><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">Sydney Sweeney got bit by a huntsman spider while filming a scene for ‘Anyone But You.’ <a href="https://t.co/trrJp6Afzr">pic.twitter.com/trrJp6Afzr</a></p>  — Sebastian Dandelion 🇵🇸 (@si

<p>Every year since 2009, a Call of Duty game or the newest release from Rockstar Games has been the No. 1 best-selling title of the year in the United States. But in 2023, that lengthy run could come to an end.</p><p>Hogwarts Legacy remains the No. 1 best-selling game of 2023 in the US, and according to Circana analyst Mat Piscatella, it is <a href="https://twitter.com/MatPiscatella/status/1734947463541506258">"certainly possible"</a> that the game will finish 2023 on top, beating Modern Warfare III.</p><p>Hogwarts Legacy launched in February, while Modern Warfare III arrived in November, so the Harry Potter game has a huge advantage in terms of total time in the market relative to Call of Duty. Beyond that, Piscatella told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-dutys-domination-of-us-video-game-sales-is-in-contention-thanks-to-hogwarts-legacy">IGN</a> that Modern Warfare II is selling worse than Modern Warfare II did a year ago during a similar length of time on the market.<

<p>You've been playing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/lego-fortnite-tips-and-tricks/2900-4985/">Lego Fortnite</a> for a while, and you've upgraded your crafting bench to rare quality and have unlocked all sorts of new blueprints to build. There's just one problem: most of these blueprints require new materials you don't have yet, like copper. But, fortunately for you, we're about to tell you where to find that, how to harvest it, and what to do with it once you have it.</p><h2>Where to find copper in Lego Fortnite</h2><p>You'll likely have to venture pretty far from your home village to get copper, because it's only found in lava caves, and lava caves are found in the desert biome. If you're looking for copper you've probably already spent some time there, but if you haven't, you should expect it to be the opposite direction from the snowy areas, as that seems to be where the desert biome spawns.</p><figure style="width: 1920px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads
