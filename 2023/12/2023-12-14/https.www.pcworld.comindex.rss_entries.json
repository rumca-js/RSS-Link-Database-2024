However, a minimalist setup without colorful lights often ensures greater concentration and peace of mind. The reason: The constantly changing colors of RGB lighting can distract your focus from the game, which can be particularly problematic during intense gaming moments. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The quality of sleep can also suffer from RGB flickering. Bright, colored lights disrupt your natural sleep rhythm. So if your gaming PC is in the bedroom, you should switch off the RGB effects at night, at least. What&rsquo;s more, RGB lighting consumes additional energy, even if it&rsquo;s only a little. So being economical is another good reason to switch off the lights. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/2168378/why-you-should-do-without-rgb-lighting-in-your-pc.html", "date_published": "2023-12-14T14:00:00+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "PC world", "album": "PC world", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null, "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}]
