<p>Flat-faced breeds have longer Rem sleep phases, suggesting their sleep remains puppy-like, researchers say</p><p>A recent study out of Hungary reveals that flat-faced dogs – such as French bulldogs, the most popular breed in the US – have difficulty sleeping because of an unusual attribute: their head shape.</p><p>French bulldogs specifically suffer from increased daytime sleepiness, probably due to not getting enough night-time sleep. Sleep apnea in Frenchies and other flat-faced dogs including pugs, English bulldogs, and Boston terriers is attributable to their shortened heads, or brachycephaly, a condition where the ratio of the skull length to its width is lower than normal.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/dec/14/french-bulldogs-sleeping-breathing-study">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In a fascinating new HBO documentary, Irene Taylor examines how trees affect an ensemble of very different characters</p><p>One might reasonably ask if the Emmy award–winning documentarian Irene Taylor’s new movie – an expansive investigation into how people and trees coexist – is most fundamentally a movie about people via trees, or about trees via people? For Taylor, the answer is typically unconventional – it’s actually neither; it’s a film that, as its title suggests, is about entanglements. “We are the entanglements,” she said during an interview about her film. “Characters in the film are drawn to a family tree, a garden full of trees, a forest. But the entanglements are the relationships that we have around those trees. These characters show us how trees can really drive us apart, and also bring us together.”</p><p>Trees and Other Entanglements tells the fascinating, occasionally intersecting stories of various individuals’ often strange and surprising relationships with tr

<p>The unspoken tensions between banality and evil give this German autobiographical novel, first published in 1971, a powerfully unsettling impact</p><p>The first major novel by German author Walter Kempowski describes a youth that was anything but ordinary. When the curtain rises in 1938, the protagonist Walter is a nine-year-old living with his family in the north-east German city of Rostock; by the time the novel ends in 1945, amid the smouldering ruins of the end of the second world war, he has just turned 17. Narrated through a chorus of voices, the novel recounts how the boy’s middle-class conservative milieu fell apart under the pressures of growing intolerance, political extremism and the destruction of war.</p><p>Throughout the book, “ordinary” aspects of family life sit uneasily alongside the extraordinary arc of world history, and the Germans’ uniquely catastrophic role in it. The unspoken tensions between the everyday and the apocalyptic, banality and evil, give the nove
