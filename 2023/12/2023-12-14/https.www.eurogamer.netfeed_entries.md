Hey everyone, is it Christmas holiday time for you yet? Here on Eurogamer we're around for another week, and we'll be keeping your stockings well stuffed over the break with a few regular presents. 
</p><p>
Before all that, another regular feature - the <a href="https://reedexpo.efmfeedback.com/se/705E3EC868220589">Eurogamer reader survey for 2023</a>. If you have two minutes (and it really is just two minutes, honest!) to tell us a little bit about your gaming habits this year, it'll help us better tailor our output for you in 2024.
</p><p>
And hey, if you're lucky enough to be taking some holiday already - what else are you going to be doing? Playing video games? Yes, probably that. But it really is just two minutes!

A24 has partnered with Kojima Productions to bring the live-action Death Stranding film to life. 
</p><p>
The American film and TV production company is known for its surreal work, making it a good fit for Kojima (in my opinion). It also acts as a distributor for films, with titles such as the Oscar winning Everything Everywhere All At Once and the brilliant (also in my opinion) Ex Machina included in its library. 
</p><p>
"A24 was born into this world about 10 years ago, their presence is singular within the industry, they are like no other. The films they are delivering to the world are high in quality and very innovative," Death Stranding creator Hideo Kojima said following the announcement.

## Former Rockstar dev explains GTA6's missing PC release, calls it a matter of priorities

Former Rockstar developer Mike York has explained why <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> isn't releasing on PC at launch. 
</p><p>
After years of waiting, Rockstar gave us our first slice of GTA 6 last week with a new trailer. Soon after, the studio confirmed the game will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-will-release-on-xbox-series-xs-and-playstation-5-in-2025">release sometime in 2025 on both Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5</a>. At the time of writing, there is no word on a PC release window.
</p><p>
According to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CjSHda9IcY">York</a>, who worked on the likes of GTA 5 and Red Dead Redemption 2 during his time at Rockstar, a PC port of a big AAA games takes longer to come out than console because a studio has to "prioritise what sells". 


## Against the Storm review - a perfectly chaotic city builder

This isn't a Game of the Year article, but it could be: from its earliest iteration in Early Access, to its full release now, Against the Storm has become one of my all-time favourites. There are so many points where the concept of a roguelike city builder could wear out - it evades them all with endless, surprising depths. It has become my first choice of what to play when I feel like just playing a game, and despite the time I've poured into it, I'm still - with joyful frustration - learning new things about it.

The premise sees you establishing a series of settlements across the map, your attempts lasting as long as it takes each settlement to either become successful, or for the ominous Scorched Queen to lose her patience and deem the settlement lost. You win a settlement when you h

The strange situation that is The Day Before keeps getting stranger. 
</p><p>
Following the news that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-day-before-developer-fntastic-suddenly-announces-its-shut-down">developer Fntastic was closing down with immediate effect</a>, a former employee has shed more insight onto the studio and The Day Before's development. 
</p><p>
Speaking with <a href="https://www.dualshockers.com/the-day-before-not-an-mmo-fntastic-developer/">DualShockers</a>, the anonymous source said The Day Before was never intended to be an MMO, despite its marketing stating otherwise. It was actually meant to be inspired by "a mix of Rust, DayZ and Escape from Tarkov," they said.

Twitch has streamlined its sexual content policy in the wake of increased suggestive streams on the platform.
</p><p>
A <a href="https://safety.twitch.tv/s/article/Updating-our-Approach-to-Sexual-Content-and-Content-Classification-Labels?language=en_US">new blog post</a> outlines a consolidation of its previous guidelines into one clear policy, as well as detailing how and why streams with explicit content will no longer appear on the homepage.
</p><p>
The change comes after a recent rise of sexually suggestive streams. The appropriateness of this type of content on Twitch has long been debated, as many feel the platform is primarily for gaming streams. However, as it's grown and diversified, new controversies have arisen.

If you have played <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spider-man-2-walkthrough-9356">Marvel's Spider-Man 2</a>, you will know Hailey Cooper. She was first introduced in the Spider-Man spin-off Miles Morales, before her role was expanded for Insomniac's recent sequel. 
</p><p>
Hailey is, quite simply, a brilliant character, and one that actress Natasha Ofili brings an incredible warmth and humanity to. Hailey is strong, she is funny, she is kind and she is a supportive friend to Miles. She is also Deaf. Hailey wears hearing aids, she communicates with Miles through American Sign Language (ASL), uses text to speak with those who do not sign and her school has an ASL interpreter on campus. 
</p><p>
I sat down with Ofili over Zoom, to talk about the importance of seeing Deaf characters like Hailey in video games, as well as where the
