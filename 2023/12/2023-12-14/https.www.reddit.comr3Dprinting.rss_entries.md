One of them I was reeled into because of how customizable it was and I could find endless communities getting me even more involved in 3d printing. The other was a boring kobra 2. I say its boring because I've sliced up and have given it 24 hours plus printing jobs and was able to let it do its thing. Not the ender however, the ender keeps things a lot more fresh, leave it alone for just a few hours without supervision and you could find your 3D printing studio filled with your $60 fillament in strings everywhere. My kobra 2 has become a print farm for the ender, making it neat attachments and cool decorative mods because well hell i dont trust the ender to make it for itself. Steer clear of the ender junk and buy the anycubic kobra 2, it works. I hope this helps anyone wishing to dip their toes into 3D printing. Also be aware that filament will be at your house routinely d

It's an alpha version of a web service called Fillacolor, which allows users to upload any image and then extracts matching 3D printer filaments based on color and polymer type.</p> <p>For starters, we have created a simple process:</p> <p>Here's how it works:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Drag and drop</strong> your images of 3D printed objects.</li> <li><strong>Select</strong> how many colors you want and what polymer type you prefer.</li> <li><strong>Voil√†!</strong> You will get the best matched 3D printer filaments based on your desired type.</li> </ul> <p>We are 3D printing enthusiasts ourselves, and because we faced this issue before, we decided to try and make a tool that will perfectly match filaments with the images of 3D printed models.
