<p>Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren is the latest public figure <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://theintercept.com/2023/12/14/meta-instagram-palestine-censorship/">to question</a> how Meta is moderating content during the Israel-Hamas war. In a letter addressed to Mark Zuckerberg, Warren raises several issues reported by Instagram users since October 7, and presses Meta for more information about its underlying policies and how much content the company has taken down related to the conflict.</p>
<p>In the<a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24223237-20231213-letter-to-meta-re-palestine"> letter</a>, Warren cites reports from the media and human rights groups about inconsistencies in the company’s moderation practices since the start of the war. In particular, she notes that numerous Instagram users have accused the company of "<a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-is-temporarily-changing-facebook-comment-

<p>Agility Robotics <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnkM0AecxYA">shared</a> a demo video Wednesday of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-02-27-the-digit-robot-could-be-the-future-of-humanoid-pizza-deliveri.html">one of its Digit robots</a> upgraded with AI. Although that may conjure terrifying pop-culture images of sentient sci-fi machines taking over the world, the demo video reveals something much more pedestrian, if not boring. The bipedal warehouse robot ploddingly works to complete a slightly puzzling task without direct human control or detailed guidance. In the clip, it slowly but successfully interprets and executes the command, “Take the box that’s the color of Darth Vader’s lightsaber, and move it to the tallest tower in the front row.”</p>
<p>The company, which <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-next-gen-digits-robot-gets-a-head-and-hands-120001329.html">added a “head” and “hands” to Digit</a> earlier this year, pitches the demonst

TikTok user @robdad_ <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@robdad_">posted</a> a short clip of it, captioned, “I just randomly discovered Spotify’s ChatGPT?” For the chosen guinea pigs, the feature is available as an option under Your Library after tapping the plus sign to create a new playlist.

It’s a landmark moment in history and one that means we can have hope for the future of humanity. Unless, that is, you spend any time examining the substance of the deal to see if the expectations meet the reality.

<p>If you’ve been crowding around your gaming console waiting for the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fallout-4-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-update-212012508.html">long-promised “next-gen” patch</a> for <em>Fallout 4,</em> you still have a ways to go. Bethesda just announced that the update <a href="https://twitter.com/Fallout/status/1734966577177534610">has been pushed to 2024,</a> after being promised for this year. There has been no information given as to what part of the year the patch would release, though developers have stated they just need “a bit more time.”</p>
<p>The “next-gen” patch is really a current-gen update, as it's being developed for PS5, Xbox Series X/S and PC. However, <em>Fallout 4</em> <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-06-14-fallout-4.html">did originally release in 2015</a> for the previous generation of consoles, so by that metric this is a next-gen patch.

<p>More than 16 million people have explored Hideo Kojima's haunting game so far. <em>Death Stranding </em>tasks a courier named Sam Porter Bridges (played by Norman Reedus) with unifying a fractured America after a cataclysmic event.

<p>Gaming laptops have been some of the most intriguing portable PCs for the past few years. As with most of the best laptops available now, they’ve gotten thinner and lighter, but they’ve also become vastly more powerful and efficient thanks to advanced CPUs and GPUs. They’ve also adopted some bold innovations, like rotating hinges and near desktop-like customizability. Gaming <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-laptops-120008636.html">laptops</a> are where PC makers can get adventurous.<br /><br />If you’re a professional who needs a machine that can help you blaze through work during the 9-5 hours but also make it easy to crush a few rounds of Apex Legends on occasion, a good gaming laptop might be your best bet.

Threads’ “topic tags” are a lot like hashtags, but not entirely the same. For one, there’s no hash (#). They’re also able to contain spaces, meaning the tags can read like normal phrases rather than a bunch of words smashed together, as has long been the norm on Twitter/X and the like. Just like normal hashtags, though, they’ll be highlighted in blue and link out to other posts containing that tag.</p>
<p>It’s pretty basic stuff… which makes the effectiveness of the new prank feel all the more absurd. It goes like this: someone creates a Threads post, ideally with a lot of text, then slaps a “Show more” tag at the end, seemingly in the m

<p>Intel today is entering the &quot;AI PC&quot; era with the launch of its new Core Ultra notebook chips. Originally codenamed &quot;Meteor Lake,&quot; these are Intel's first processors to include an NPU, or neural processing unit, for accelerating AI tasks. The launch comes a week after AMD revealed its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amds-ryzen-8040-chips-remind-intel-its-falling-behind-in-ai-pcs-200043544.html">upcoming Ryzen 8040 hardware</a>, its second batch of chips to include NPUs. While Intel is playing a bit of AI catch-up,  the Core Ultra chips still sound like a solid step forward — at least according to the company's benchmarks.</p>
<p>Intel claims the Core Ultra chips use up to 79 percent less power than AMD's last-gen Ryzen 7840U while idling in Windows, and they're also up to 11 percent faster than AMD's hardware for multithreaded tasks. Intel didn't have the upcoming Ryzen 8040 chips to test, but it'll be interesting to see how they both compare next year.</p>

At first, only a random one percent of Chrome users globally will see &quot;Tracking Protection&quot; enabled in their browser, meaning third-party cookies will be blocked by default.

<p>Following a two-year investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), Tesla will <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-recalls-2-million-cars-in-order-to-fix-autopilot-safety-controls-123308343.html">recall over two million vehicles</a> to address Autopilot safety concerns.</p>
<p>Fixes will be issued through free over-the-air (OTA) updates, adding features that ensure drivers pay attention while using Tesla’s Autopilot driver assistance system. It affects all current Tesla EVs built since Autopilot launched in 2015, including the Model 3, Model Y, Model S and Model X.</p>
<p>Those features will include more prominent visual alerts, making it easier to turn Autosteer on and off, and eventual suspension from Autosteer if the driver fails to behave responsibly. NHTSA opened the investigation following 11 crashes with parked first-responder vehicles, which resulted in 17 injuries and one death, since 2018.</p>

<p>Every day, there seems to be new generative AI news, and while it can often be serious and quite technical, this time around it's just plain fun. Instagram has launched a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/generative-ai-image-editing-is-coming-to-instagram-183711111.html">new generative AI-powered tool</a> called backdrop that lets you create a new image in the, yes, background of your Story. Meta's generative AI lead, <a href="https://www.threads.net/@aaldahle/post/C0zTQYZgiB9">Ahmad Al-Dahle, announced the feature on Threads</a> alongside a video tutorial.</p>
<p>Instagram's backdrop tool appears once you upload or capture content for your Story. It sits alongside existing icons at the top of your screen, like text and music, represented by an image of a person with a rectangular frame behind them. To use backdrop, just click on that icon, and the image's entire background will go checkered (similar to picture editors like PhotoShop) along with a text box prompting you to &quot;d

<p>Meta's Threads has finally arrived in Europe over five months after it launched in the US, UK and elsewhere around the world. Following a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/threads-countdown-hints-at-eu-launch-on-december-14-183053910.html">countdown</a> and Instagram teaser invitation, the app is now officially available in the bloc on iOS, Android and the web.</p>
<p>Threads.net is now live on the web, though the mobile apps are still showing as unavailable for many (you may have to wait patiently). I was able to sign in using my Instagram account, though Meta also offers access without creating a profile — though you can't post or interact with content in that case. Once I agreed to use Instagram and chose my profile, it asked if I was okay with it being public and if wanted to follow the same people I do on Instagram. A few more clicks and I was in.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Proton finally has a desktop app. The Swiss company, known for its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/proton-encrypted-email-vpn-calendar-rebrand-103024950.html">privacy-focused alternatives</a> to the Google Workspace apps, revealed a Windows and macOS application on Thursday that includes Proton Mail and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-31-protonmail-encrypted-calendar.html">Proton Calendar</a>. The desktop app is currently available in beta for subscribers on the most expensive premium tier, but the company says it will launch for all Proton users in early 2024.</p>
<p>The company says the desktop app has a modern design with a clutter-free experience. Proton views the move as providing a leg up over Google. “While many people use email on desktop in a browser, desktop apps can still provide certain advantages such as better offline support,” Proton CEO Andy Yen wrote in a press release. “For this reason, we have decided to launch a desktop app, something that even Gmai
