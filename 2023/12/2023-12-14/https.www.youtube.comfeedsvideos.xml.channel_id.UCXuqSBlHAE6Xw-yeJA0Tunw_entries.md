We went to AliExpress to find parts to create janky headphones. Yep, that’s right. We thought we could compete with the likes of Sennheiser, Apple, Bose and Sony by creating our on 3d printed headphones using materials purchased from the AliBaba marketplace. And naturally, we needed someone impartial to test the cans, so we got our good friend Dankpods to come out and give em a listen!
