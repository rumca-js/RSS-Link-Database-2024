		Apple is testing a new security setting to address the theft of iPhones and at least one of the new features seems blindingly obvious.

In February, The Wall Street Journal reported on what seemed to be an increase in iPhone threats. Not only are thieves bypassing biometric safeguards by stealing the user’s passcode, once they get into a phone, they quickly disable those safeguards to completely compromise it.

		Identity verification providers presented two marketing mindsets this week. The more predominant one was confident business as usual but the other was a sober realization of "stark" industry realities.

The business-as-usual crowd included Mastercard, whose market share has grown incrementally; Entersekt, which is buying market share; and the U.S. Payments Forum, whose members are weighing multi-factor authentication.

On the shaken side of things is automated ID-verification service firm <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/au10tix">Au10tix</a>.
