At more than two hours, there&#8217;s a lot to absorb, and different members of the GeekWire team are currently at various stages of listening and reading. But one especially interesting and timely topic comes up closer to the end of the episode, when Fridman asks the Amazon and Blue Origin founder about artificial intelligence.
