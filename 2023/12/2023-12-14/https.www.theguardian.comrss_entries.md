<p>Kemar Roofe’s late goal earned Rangers a memorable 3-2 win against Real Betis and a place in the Europa League knockout stages.</p><p>Roofe turned the ball home from close range as Rangers put the pressure on from a 78th-minute corner to clinch top spot in Group C. They inflicted a first home defeat of the season on the Spaniards in Seville as Roofe’s second goal of the season moved them above Sparta Prague from third place and sent Betis into the Conference League.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/dec/14/rangers-floor-real-betis-in-thriller-to-extend-europa-league-adventure">Continue reading...</a>

<p></p><p>Laying on European football has long been David Moyes’s way of silencing his critics and, while inconsistent domestic form continues to plague West Ham, they can start planning for another continental adventure after securing first place in their Europa League group with a dominant win over Freiburg.</p><p>This was a professional effort from the winners of the Europa Conference League. While both sides were already through, West Ham still needed a point to guarantee progress into the last 16. The alternative was being pitted into a play-off against one of the sides who have dropped down from the Champions League – a tie with Milan could have been on the cards – and Moyes had to be impressed with the way West Ham got the job done with polished goals from Mohammed Kudus and Edson Álvarez during the first half.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/dec/14/west-ham-freiburg-europa-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

## João Pedro strikes late to sink Marseille and put Brighton in last 16

<p>Roberto De Zerbi has acknowledged that, like his Brighton team, he remains a work in progress as a manager. The Italian looked like he would be forced to settle for a place in the playoff round of the Europa League in their debut campaign after being frustrated in their attempts to overhaul Marseille at the top of their group by their canny opponents.</p><p>But a dramatic late strike from João Pedro with his sixth goal of the competition ensured they would advance directly to the last 16 at the expense of the French side. Having lost their first-ever European game against AEK Athens here back in September, qualifying as group winners represents quite a feat for a club that was playing in League One as recently as 2011.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/dec/14/brighton-marseille-europa-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Eddie Howe faces some tricky decisions about his style of football, the Carabao Cup and who to buy in January</p><p>Newcastle were excellent for an hour against Milan on Wednesday but <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/dec/13/newcastle-milan-champions-league-match-report" title="">ended up losing 2-1</a> and dropping out of Europe at the end of a night when continued Champions League involvement had seemed well within their grasp. The problem was that, not for the first time in recent weeks, a side missing a starting XI of injured senior players simply could not sustain Eddie Howe’s hallmark, exhaustingly high-tempo, heavy-metal high-pressing game. Is a change, or at least a modification, of style required? No one can question the team’s often awe-inspiring commitment but human beings, even Joelinton, cannot run through brick walls. An energy-conserving Plan B, perhaps involving a cagier counterattacking plan, seems called for. After all, the very best sides all kn

First, it launched a massive <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/15/russia-avdiivka-offensive-failing-top-ukrainian-officer-donetsk">frontal assault</a>. Dozens of <a href="https://twitter.com/Tendar/status/1712902497717674006">pieces of equipment were destroyed</a>. Then it dispatched armoured columns in different directions. Now, in a third wave, small groups of infantry are being sent to penetrate Ukrainian positions.</p><p>“There are dozens of bodies. They try to advance. We kill them. They send more,” said Ivan Smaga, the deputy commander of Ukraine’s 25th storm battalion, which is defending Avdiivka. “To begin with it was groups of 10 men. Now it’s one or two or three without support. Their commander uses them like live meat.”</p>

<p><strong>Sadler’s Wells, London<br /></strong>Tim Burton’s film is a natural fit for Bourne’s choreography and a bright young cast bring its bittersweet tale to fresh life</p><p>Matthew Bourne is a canny operator when it comes to choosing titles and concepts with instant appeal, but his stage version of Tim Burton’s film isn’t just shrewd marketing – it is a perfect fit with his own sensibilities as a choreographer. There’s the outsider status of the central figure, the pastel-perfect (or is it?) 1950s suburban setting, the comic book-style exaggeration of plot and characters. It’s a warmly entertaining watch with a bittersweet thread running through.</p><p>Bourne created this version back in 2005 and it was last revived nine years ago. Tonight, Liam Mower plays the tragic Edward, left with scissors for digits when his Dr Frankenstein-esque father/creator dies before completing him. Mower nails the stilted walk you will recognise from Johnny Depp’s portrayal in the film, as well as

If but one person in the audience yawns, or in any way suggests they’re not paying attention, I see it. And it’s a dagger to my heart. This is why I always found presenting to millions on live television a lot easier than addressing even just a couple of dozen people in the flesh.

<p>Time, quantum mechanics, and the nature of reality are woven together in a mind-bending journey to the edge of reality</p><p>Black Holes: The End of the Universe? by John Taylor was the first book I bought with my&nbsp;own hard-earned cash from a poorly paid paper round. It was 1974,&nbsp;I&nbsp;was 11. It was the subtitle that&nbsp;grabbed my attention, since I’d never&nbsp;heard of black holes. At the time these mysterious cosmic objects were merely a theoretical possibility, but a&nbsp;half-century later we have ample evidence that they really do exist. After writing bestsellers about quantum mechanics, time, and the nature of reality, Italian physicist Carlo&nbsp;Rovelli weaves all three together&nbsp;in his latest book, taking us on a journey deep inside a black hole. An accomplished storyteller, Rovelli begins this mind-boggling ride by explaining how they form.</p><p>Sooner or later, stars run out of fuel&nbsp;and stop shining.

<p>The royal drama’s final episodes are an improvement on the wild ‘ghost Diana’ era … even if there is a dream sequence with Tony Blair as King, and Prince Harry is a mere cartoon</p><p>What is the monarchy for? What is The Crown for? The two questions slalom side by side as Netflix’s super-lush biographical drama concludes the story of Queen Elizabeth II. But the overriding theme is the same one that has underpinned Peter Morgan’s scripts all along: a life of public service, we are told, is a burden that demands great personal sacrifice, with the main loss being one’s happiness. How convinced you are by that will determine how effective you find The Crown’s denouement.</p><p>The series does largely recover from its wobble in the first half of the season, when Princess Diana took over the whole show and led to some wild creative decisions, chief among them “ghost Diana”. The riskiest moment in the new episodes is a dream sequence in which the Queen imagines her reign being ended by

<p>They were leading artists of their age – and from different worlds. Soon the encounter led Warhol to create some of his finest late period works</p><p>Documentary footage of Andy Warhol and Joseph Beuys’s first meeting at an exhibition opening in Düsseldorf in 1979 is perhaps more notable for its flashing cameras and gawking bystanders than what passes between the artists themselves. Under press surveillance, the forthright Beuys makes most of the conversation. Warhol, beneath his trademark blond wig, is as awkward and retiring as ever. The art writer David Galloway described the encounter as having “the ceremonial aura of two rival popes meeting in Avignon”.</p><p>You can allow Galloway his myth-making. The two artists were epic opposites. As the gallerist Thaddaeus Ropac explains, Warhol, the exalter of consumerism, celebrity and surface glamour, “stood for America.

But for many claiming to confront the perceived threat, that suits all too well</p><p>Look at the business of tackling the migration crisis in Europe, and you will find evidence not of some one-off failure to plan ahead, or a policy initiative gone wrong through unexpected circumstances.

The perverse outcomes of the war on smuggling – including thousands of border deaths, escalating political brinkmanship and the professionalisation of the human smuggling business itself – are more than a blip or an anomaly. When policies persistently fail, we need to look not only at “what went wrong” but also at “what went right”– and at who is benefiting from the wreckage.</p><p>The habit of waging “war” on everything has spr
