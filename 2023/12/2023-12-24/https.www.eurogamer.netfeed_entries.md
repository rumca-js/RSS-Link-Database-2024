</p><p>Despite being "content-complete", the team says that as some members "come from a region affected by conflict", timescales have slipped and the mod has not been tested as thoroughly as hoped. Consequently, the release has been pushed back to allow for more testing time. 
</p><p>"Despite being content-complete as planned, upon careful consideration, we've recognised that our testing process may not be as robust as we desire," the team said in a statement posted to social media.

</p><p>That's according to XboxEra's Nick Baker, who announced on "The 4th Annual Grubbsmas Shpeshaltacular" that he'd heard a remaster of the first three God of War games "might be happening".
</p><p>"I, for a long time, have been a person who has bemoaned the direction God of War went somewhat, and have yearned for the hack-and-slash OG God of War games. I just love them so much", Baker said (thanks, <a href="https://www.ggrecon.com/articles/god-of-war-trilogy-remaster-rumour/">GGRecon</a>).

Listen. There have been a lot of great games this year. Maybe more than in any year we can easily remember. Because of this we've handled our top 50 list of our best games a little differently.
</p><p>
Below you'll find two groups of games from 2023. Going backwards, at the bottom you'll find our top 10 in an ordered list. And above that you'll find the other 40 we really, really loved, but we've arranged these alphabetically.
</p><p>
Honestly, that's because, with a year like this, if we'd tried to order them all we'd still be arguing over it. And in a year this great - and a year this painful for the people who make games and work around them - that would be no good. So here are our favourite 50 games of the year. We hope you can find something in here that passed you by and will make for a lovely discovery.
