<p>The Uruguayan striker will reunite with his former Barcelona teammates in Miami. But at 37-years-old, how much does he have left to offer? </p><p>Inter Miami have added another superstar to the fold.<strong> </strong>The announcement of Inter Miami’s latest signing means Lionel Messi will link up with yet another former Barcelona teammate at DRV PNK Stadium next season. Joining fellow former Camp Nou heroes Messi, Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba, Luis Suárez has agreed a one-year deal with the MLS side, with the option of a further year.</p><p>But by the time Messi and Suárez take to the field for Inter Miami, it will have been almost four years since they last played together. Suárez, who turns 37 in January, has played for three clubs in that time, in three countries. As he has battled the inevitable effects of aging, how different a player is the version of Suárez set for a Miami reunion with Messi?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/dec/24/the-messi-effect-l

<p>Last season’s Serie A champions won’t be defending their title. Their movie producer president has seen to that </p><p>Friday marked the 40th anniversary of the first <em>cinepanettone</em> – a genre of comedy movie released in Italy around Christmas-time each year. <em>Vacanze di Natale</em> was produced by Aurelio De Laurentiis, the man who would go on to become president of Napoli 21 years later. The story goes that he was unimpressed at first, worrying that the jokes were not funny enough, but its lampooning of Italy’s nouveaux riche struck a chord. A tradition was born.</p><p>De Laurentiis was the one throwing money around this weekend, signing Victor Osimhen to a new contract worth €10m per year after tax. It theoretically ties the Nigerian to Napoli until 2026, though a reported €130m release clause would not put him out of reach of football’s wealthier buyers.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/dec/24/despite-osimhen-deal-napolis-christmas-movie-is

The radio presenter on Marmite croissants and the magic of boat yards<p><strong>What time are you up?</strong> About 9am. I try to lie in, but as I get older, I find it harder. During the week, I have a mid-morning radio show so I’m up at 7am. It’s not the crack of dawn, but I certainly enjoy that moment on a Sunday when I realise I don’t have to drag my carcass out of bed.</p><p><strong>What’s for breakfast? </strong>My first job of the day is to get coffee and pastries from a lovely bakery called Rye by the Water. My kids like pain au chocolat, while my wife and I like their amazing cheese and Marmite croissants. I might buy a nice granary sandwich loaf as well, for later.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/dec/24/sunday-with-james-obrien-radio-presenter">Continue reading...</a>
