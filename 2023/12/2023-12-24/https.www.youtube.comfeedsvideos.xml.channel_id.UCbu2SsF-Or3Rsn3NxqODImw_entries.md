Is it a Chicago Typewriter or a GI Trench Sweeper? From Call of Duty and Battlefield to Mafia and Resident Evil 4, these are the two flavors of the Tommy Gun that we’re used to seeing in our games.

With the help of Keeper of Firearms & Artillery, Jonathan Ferguson, we’ve come to the Royal Armouries museum in the UK to learn more about the unique history of the Thompson, and explore the pop culture legacy of this iconic SMG.


In this episode of Loadout, Dave Jewitt visits the Royal Armouries to talk to Keeper of Firearms & Artillery Jonathan Ferguson to chart the unique pop culture legacy of the Thompson SMG.
