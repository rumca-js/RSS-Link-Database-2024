Through the soothing melody we aim to convey the peace, love, and deep reverence we feel for the Savior's humble beginnings in a manger. This Christmas, let's reconnect with the true essence of the season - celebrating the birth of Jesus Christ and the eternal hope He brings to each of us. Merry Christmas and may your hearts be filled with His divine love and light.\n\nLearn about our beliefs here: https://smarturl.it/TPG_Beliefs \n\nFollow The Piano Guys:\nInstagram: http", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVyE3qFBV-0", "date_published": "2023-12-24T13:00:22+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "The Piano Guys", "album": "The Piano Guys", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/ZVyE3qFBV-0/hqdefault.jpg", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}]
