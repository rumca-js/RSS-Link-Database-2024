There have been a lot of great games this year. Maybe more than in any year we can easily remember. Because of this we've handled our top 50 list of our best games a little differently.\n</p><p>\nBelow you'll find two groups of games from 2023. Going backwards, at the bottom you'll find our top 10 in an ordered list. And above that you'll find the other 40 we really, really loved, but we've arranged these alphabetically.\n</p><p>\nHonestly, that's because, with a year like this, if we'd tried to order them all we'd still be arguing over it. And in a year this great - and a year this painful for the people who make games and work around them - that would be no good. So here are our favourite 50 games of the year. We hope you can find something in here that passed you by and will make for a lovely discovery.\n</p> <p><a href=\"", "link": "https://www.eurogamer.net/here-are-eurogamers-favourite-games-of-2023", "date_published": "2023-12-24T10:00:00+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "Eurogamer.net Latest Articles Feed", "album": "Eurogamer.net Latest Articles Feed", "user": null, "language": "en-gb", "thumbnail": "https://assetsio.reedpopcdn.com/2023030614365800_s.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=crop&enable=upscale&auto=webp", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 51, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 2, "page_rating": 51, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}]
