Establishing memorable characters goes a long way to servicing an emotional plot, alongside coherent writing, and comprehensive direction. \n\nThe games in this rundown however seem to have lost the plot \u2013 so to speak \u2013 with their convoluted stories drumming up to unsatisfying conclusions. Some end suddenly, some are the culmination of an underbaked narrative, some feature unlikeable characters, boring missions, or unfathomably drastic game-breaking bugs, that by the time the credits roll your past caring what happens anyway. \n\nIn a year of solid video game releases, these ten games represent the flipside, the what not to do, when crafting a compelling story.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVNPGJniep8", "date_published": "2023-12-24T15:30:05+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "GamingBolt", "album": "GamingBolt", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/AVNPGJniep8/hqdefault.jpg", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "15 BIGGEST Video Game Worlds of 2023", "description": "For as long as games have existed, as a medium, they have never stopped trying to deliver increasingly larger virtual worlds. In 2023, we saw plenty more examples of that, and over the course of the year, there was no shortage of games \u2013 open world or otherwise \u2013 that transported players to worlds that were teeming with real estate to run around and explore in. \n\nFrom magical fantasy lands to real world sandboxes for web swinging superheroes, from the expanses of outer space to futuristic, cyberpunk cities, 2023 delivered a glut of gaming worlds that you could (and many did) lose yourselves to for endless hours at a stretch.
