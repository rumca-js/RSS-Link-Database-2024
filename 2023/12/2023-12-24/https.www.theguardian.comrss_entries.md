<p>The Sherlock creator’s annual festive spookathon is predictably hammy and great.

Men who understand the significance of men who drink “Scotch in the jug, Irish in the bottle”. (Me neither.) Men who dabble in the dark arts of – <em>shiver</em> – “eastern studies”. Basically, men … plus one mummy of the dead rather than the female variety. Auction lot no 249. About 40 centuries old. Bad teeth. May be under the command of Ned Bellingham, the kind of fanatical Egyptology student you definitely don’t want to come across in an Arthur Conan Doyle story. Could this “bag of bones” be responsible for the attempted garrotting and drowning of two students, both of whom happen to have crossed Bellingham? Great Scot, it’s Mark Gatiss’s Christmas ghos

<p>Sudanese military conflict has killed thousands and created what UN says is world’s largest human displacement crisis</p><p>The eruption of gunfire in Sudan’s capital on 15 April was not a complete surprise to Mohamed Eisa, a gastroenterologist living in Pittsburgh who had returned to Sudan to bury his father. He had seen pickup trucks full of armed men circling the streets of Khartoum, and was aware of the rivalry between the country’s military and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) paramilitary group.</p><p>As open warfare erupted that Saturday, Eisa expected the combat would be brief. Africa’s third-largest country lies on the strategic Red Sea and shares borders with a number of states important to western powers like the United States and their allies in the Gulf and Europe – all players whom he expected to end the clash between the armed groups.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/24/sudan-war-aid-khartoum-darfur">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Soft and sweet, this festive bread is the Christmas treat that keeps on giving, so long as you know how to fashion the leftovers into ongoing treats …</p><p><strong><br /></strong>Two dough hooks are moving rather like tweezers, lifting and dropping, twisting and slapping the dough. The mixer is in Davide Longoni’s warm baking lab in the Calvairate district of Milan where, between early November and December, they make 9,000 <em>panettoni</em>. This is the first stage: flour, <em>lievito madre</em> (mother dough), water, sugar and egg yolks mixed, at various speeds, for an hour. After resting for 12 hours more, or when the dough has doubled in size, it will meet the hooks again, as well as a sequence of other ingredients. First: the best butter – 700g for every kilo of flour – then sugar, honey, more yolks, raisins, and precious candied orange and <em>cedro</em> (very large Italian lemon), each ingredient twisted in before the next is added.

<p>From angry confrontations to romantic reunions, Guardian writers pick the big-screen moments that have stayed with them the most</p><p>Martin Scorsese’s Killers of the Flower Moon is frequently enthralling over the course of its three-and-a-half-hour runtime, sinking into the depths of American shame as it follows William Hale (Robert De Niro) and his unofficial lieutenant Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio) as they grasp for the money and land controlled by the Osage tribe in 1920s Oklahoma, which involves slowly poisoning Ernest’s wife Mollie (Lily Gladstone) as they kill off members of her family and community. But just when it seems like the story’s final dominoes are tumbling over with inevitability, Scorsese jumps ahead for his final scene – maybe the most audacious in American movies this year.

<p>Self-appointed postman Vincent Berthelot’s mission to deliver letters by hand has spread beyond his native country</p><p>It started off as an unconventional way to chart an itinerary for a months-long, post-retirement cycling trip, with Vincent Berthelot offering to personally deliver letters across France and see where the whims of the writers would take him.</p><p>What swiftly became clear was the transformative power of hand-delivered letters, at times reuniting family members and long-lost friends. Eight years on, his idea has swelled into a movement, with more than 100 people now crossing continents to make offline connections in a virtual world.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/dec/24/france-retired-teacher-vincent-berthelot-delivering-letters-from-loved-ones">Continue reading...</a>

It’s not enough to say ‘time for a change’ – voters want clear policies on the NHS and welfare reform<p>One of the most powerful arguments in politics is “time for a change”. It was the Labour pitch back in 1987, but when Margaret Thatcher won a third term, she received a congratulatory letter from Douglas Hurd, who told her she had “defeated it, or rather captured it for your own purpose”.</p><p>Rishi Sunak briefly toyed with trying to do the same earlier this autumn, but unless something extraordinary happens, and we’ve hardly had an ordinary few years in politics, the coming year will bring a change in government. The polls suggest voters have bought the argument that it is time for a change. Even many Conservatives seem to think they’d benefit from a change of scene and a break from government.

The original Super League plan failed in April 2021 because supporters of the six English clubs that jumped ship simply would not tolerate the idea.

<p>At 82, the revered director of Spirited Away and My Neighbour Totoro has made his most personal film yet – a sometimes unwieldy tale of a 12-year-old boy coming to terms with his mother’s death</p><p>It’s the film that the revered animator and co-founder of Studio Ghibli<strong> </strong>Hayao Miyazaki came out of retirement to make, and it’s arguably one of his most personal. <em>The Boy and the Heron</em> is a strikingly beautiful, densely detailed fantasy that revisits themes and devices familiar from previous films and ties them together with elements that have a clear autobiographical resonance for the director. The dream logic of the narrative seems to have been born from the untrammelled imagination of a child rather than that of a man in his 80s. The lush orchestral score, by regular Miyazaki collaborator Joe Hisaishi, is shimmering and exultant. All the elements are in place. So it seems almost churlish to note that this is middling Miyazaki at best.</p><p>Of course, a mi

He’s already done the school run – Skinner had his first and only child with long-term partner Cath Mason in 2012, and Buzz is now 11 years old. They walked the dog across Hampstead Heath. “We’ve got a white cavapoo called Poppy,” Skinner goes on. “So it all works out quite neatly.

Indeed, bubbly, along with the various experimentations being made with leaving white grapes on their skins (aka orange, or skin-contact white wines), is perhaps the single most creative corner of the wine world right now, a far, distant cry from the days, not all that long ago, when it was basically champagne plus a few cheaper, largely inferior alternatives.
