Our Louis Rossmann Face Tracking Robot is ALIVE!!!!

This project uses a Geekom AS6 Mini PC, OpenCV and Python to create an autonomous robot that follows someone's face.

OpenCV finds the X Axis coordinates of the face and then sends a serial command to the Arduino Subsystem to move the wheels left or right.

For distance we use OpenCV to find the width of the face and use that as an analogue for range with the vehicle moving forward or back based on the Width of the face object.
