They scored early and scored late, weathering the long periods of Bournemouth pressure, as well as a very Tottenham kind of rain, one that came in furious, intense squalls before disappearing entirely for around 20 minutes at a time.</p><p>But texturally this was basically the same substance Tottenham have been serving up all season: a spirited but uneven performance in which the fun is basically indistinguishable from the suffering. Pape Matar Sarr scored a fine goal before going off injured; Bournemouth were the better side for much of the first half; Spurs improved markedly in the second, making the game safe through Son Heung-Min and Richarlison, and yet still ended the game on the scramble after Alex Scott’s two late goals, one legal and one ruled out for offside.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/dec/31/tottenham-bournemouth-premier-

<p>Turning normal sleeping cycles upside down helped this bestselling writer recover her energy</p><p>“Why don’t you go to sleep when normal people do?” This is a question asked of me on countless occasions. The last time was in a radio interview and I was about to give my usual self-deprecating comments about the joys of not being normal, when I took a breath and replied, “Because I don’t want to.” It really is that simple. Going to bed at 5pm and getting up just after midnight suits me. I enjoy the peace and quiet. My productivity levels soar. It’s just a shame other people find it so difficult to accept. I’m not entirely sure why. I do exactly what everyone else does, I just do it about seven hours earlier. Around the time most of the country is pouring milk on their Weetabix, I’m chopping garlic and frying mushrooms for my lunch. As you’re settling down with a glass of wine and a film, I’ve long since gone to bed. A week of keeping to the same pattern and it became my new routine

<p>You might sit down for a cuppa with a book, with friends or to mark a special occasion – however you take it, tea time allows us to slow down</p><p>A card arrived for me in the mail. This was a surprise. My birthday had passed and Christmas was months away. Charlene, a friend from overseas, had mailed the card for no particular reason. Inside, I discovered a teabag together with an instruction: to join her in sharing a cup of tea.</p><p>I boiled the kettle and retrieved my favourite teacup. A gift from my daughter, it was a simple white cup and saucer. A regular mug just wouldn’t do. Sitting outside in the sun, I slowly sipped the brew, reflecting on a long-distance friendship that had begun when, as teenagers, we became pen pals. We had never met, but that cup of tea brought us closer together.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/01/pausing-for-tea-whether-in-reflection-or-in-celebration-brings-us-together">Continue reading...</a>

<p>We held festivals, started an energy cooperative and reduced our waste  to almost nothing. But there are downsides to putting idealists of all stripes together</p><p>Some time ago I was a single mum living in a sharehouse in Melbourne’s inner north. While not an ideal housing scenario, I couldn’t afford to live alone, and I didn’t want to. Single parenting is isolating and about as far from “it takes a village” as it gets. But what <em>is</em> the ideal way to raise a kid? And where are the utopian communes of the 70s now?</p><p>Through the hippy grapevine, I heard whispers of a cohousing community seeking new members. To clarify, cohousing is a model of intentional community with independent dwellings and shared living spaces, managed collaboratively by the occupants.

A lucky soup to see in the New Year, and a scrumptious winter warmer of a pudding<p>I have always looked forward to New Year’s Day. The welcome calm after last night’s revelry. The neat handwriting on the first page of an unsullied diary. Most cherished of all in our house is the New Year’s Day tradition of soup, a deep broth of lentils or beans to bring good luck, a celebration of winter vegetables, and sometimes thick slices of toast at the bottom of your bowl, sodden with hot broth and as comforting as a buttered crumpet.</p><p>There is often a New Year’s loaf on the go, too. A sheet of rosemary-spiked focaccia to tear apart at the table or a loaf of dark and treacly rye for eating with bitter marmalade or a wedge of pale and milky Caerphilly. The first day of the year seems like an auspicious day to embark on a new “starter” for sourdough. A good sourdough loaf with an artfully blackened crust and chewy, open crumb is a thoroughly splendid thing. That is certainly my new year res

<p>Start the new year as you mean to go on, and push the boat out with this savoury Georgian bake</p><p>What do you need on the first day of a new year, after a night of revelry? Hot bread, hot cheese and a runny egg, preferably in one neat, boat-shaped package and with a name that’s hard to pronounce when you’re hungover. Enter <em>acharuli khachapuri</em>, a delicious Georgian savoury bake that has it all: sweet, soft bread topped with salty, melted cheese and an egg cooked just so. Traditionally, a big pat of butter is placed on top, too, as if the whole thing is not rich enough already. To eat, rip off the tip of the bread boat and use it to break the yolk and mix it into the hot cheese. The first bite is the best, so savour it, then carry on ripping off the crust and dipping it in the centre until there’s none left. Roll the remains into a cheesy, doughy cigar and tuck in. Start the year as you mean to go on – it’s going to be a good one.</p><p>Sarit Packer and Itamar Srulovich

It’s self-improvement season and the air is thick with vows to do better next year. Most will be abandoned before January’s over. But is there a way to make better, stronger intentions that might actually stick?<p>A few weeks ago, I was asked at a party what my new year resolutions were. I found the very idea laughable. I’ve never made any – because I’m perfect, and delusional. I also didn’t think anyone did. I straw polled my friends, who were equally dismissive. “Nobody chooses to do anything,” pronounced Charlie, “they just happen.” Mimi, an artist, does make them – but only at solstice. “Ghastly to have everyone doing the same things at the same time.” James’s only resolution was “the Mountain Goats one.” He’s referring to the song This Year by the band of that name, which pledges: “I am going to make it through this year if it kills me.”</p><p>This left me thinking a few things. First, I have very intense friends. Second, what are resolutions? Are they now a legacy pastime, like

Accusations of rape against the actor have divided the nation, with some referring to him as the ‘last monstre sacré’<p>On 20 December, during a 135-minute-long interview on French television, dedicated to topics such as the new law on immigration, the future bill on assisted dying, the war in Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas conflict, Emmanuel Macron was asked about Gérard Depardieu. France’s president could have chosen to be cautious and not comment on a case that has divided France. It would probably have been wiser to have remained silent, but Macron doesn’t do caution; <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/dec/21/emmanuel-macron-says-gerard-depardieu-is-target-of-manhunt" title="">he speaks his mind</a>.</p><p>“You will never see me taking part in a manhunt,” he said.

UK’s pension regime makes investment nigh-on impossible.  A radical reform under Labour would turbo-charge the economy<p>The British corporate sector is dying in front of our eyes. Corporate decay and the lifelessness of our stock market, now ranking a mere 10th in the world, affects everything: jobs, careers, good wages, pensions, tax revenues and vibrant public services. Worse, Britain is rich in the research and intellectual knowledge on which successful 21st-century economies will be founded: the opportunity is being squandered. Decisively addressing what is happening must be at the forefront of the 2024 electoral debate.</p><p>What needs fixing is the financial doom loop in which our publicly listed companies are locked.

If we can’t count on the fitness of Thomas Partey, perhaps the Saudis can tempt him.

Elsewhere, Douglas Luiz won’t be the only Villa player coveted by plenty of clubs, but I just can’t see how we stump up £100m for him.

But the sound of digital music, as every vinyl fan knows, is not, and never will be, half so rich and warm as the sound of an LP, and playing it does not tend to encourage, as spinning a record does, truly serious listening. The ritual of the turntable demands concentration and invites respect. An album’s tracks, whether by Taylor Swift, Blur or the Rolling Stones (<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-6782

Draft guidance on how to support children who are questioning their gender is to be welcomed<p>As parents and clinicians in the Clinical Advisory Network on Sex and Gender, we welcome the Department for Education’s draft guidance for schools and colleges to support children and young people who are questioning their gender (“<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/dec/24/observer-view-schools-guidance-gender-identity-could-help-us-move-on-from-toxic-debate" title="">Schools guidance on gender identity could help us move on from this toxic debate</a>”, Editorial). While the guidance could be more robust, it is an excellent first step in protecting all children and young people. Girls should not be forced by schools to share toilets or changing rooms with the opposite sex, where they can be vulnerable to abuse.</p><p>Schools and colleges have, until now, been advised by unaccountable external agencies that have misrepresented the law and undermined child safeguarding.

<p>Plenty of places were worth rave reviews in 2023, although sadly it was goodbye to some old friends, too</p><p>At some point in the next few paragraphs, I will swoon over the memory of a rabbit and black pudding pie encased in an ornate glazed-pastry case so shiny, so golden, you could wave at your own reflection in it. I will rave about a ludicrously cheap tasting menu of uncommon thrills, a playing field-sized kebab platter and a noble globe artichoke. Because a great plate of food really is a source of happiness. But before we get to the high points of 2023, let’s deal with the low. If 2022 brought fierce economic headwinds for the hospitality sector, this year was simply worse. It was a story played out not in my reviews, but in the “news bites” that appear beneath them online.</p><p>Usually, it’s a roundup of pop-ups, charity fundraisers and openings, and there was quite a lot of that. But those news bites were dominated, sadly, by reports of closures. It started in January w

I could see the bodies of dead people lying in the street.” As a result of the conflict, he lost his father, and later his mother and one sibling.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/31/sudanese-confront-swedish-oil-gia
