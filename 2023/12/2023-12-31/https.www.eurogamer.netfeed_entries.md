</p><p>Video game researcher Kurakasis took to Twitter/X earlier today to detail "everything" they know to date about the upcoming game, including a rumour that it will be an "MMORPG to be precise". They also shared details of job listings that seem to confirm the game in development may be called "Land of Salvation".
</p><p>"The game is now essentially confirmed to be in development, as an NCSoft employee posted a job listing on LinkedIn with a codename logo stylised similarly to the logo of Horizon games," Kurakasis said. "It's developed under the codename Project Skyline, with the initial codename being Project H."

"In my first month, it came out he threatened to have an employee killed. In the all-hands [all staff meeting] that followed, no one wanted to speak first.
