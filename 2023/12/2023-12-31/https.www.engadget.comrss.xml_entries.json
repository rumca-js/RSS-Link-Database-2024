Leading up to the pause, the Curiosity rover was put in park \u2014 but its Hazard-Avoidance Cameras (Hazcams) kept snapping away. In a first for the rover, Curiosity recorded the passage of a Martian day over 12 hours from its stationary position, capturing its own shifting shadow on the landscape as the sun moves from dawn to dusk. It held onto the images until after the conjunction ended on November 25.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"A black and white gif of the Martian landscape and the shadow of Curiosity shifting with the sun\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-12/0904b180-a7f6-11ee-9376-ef6e2483e670\" style=\"he", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/nasas-curiosity-rover-snapped-this-dreamy-timelapse-of-a-martian-day-175701537.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-12-31T17:57:01+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "Engadget", "album": "Engadget", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null, "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}]
