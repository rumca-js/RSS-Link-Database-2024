<p>In 1861, an inauguration took place in a crisis. History was set to repeat itself in 2021 – but one Republican had done her research</p><p>The publication of Liz Cheney’s book, <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/oath-and-honor-a-memoir-and-a-warning-liz-cheney/20016859?ean=9780316572064">Oath and Honor</a>, is bringing plaudits, once again, for her courage in calling out Donald Trump’s efforts to overturn the constitution. From this historian, it brings a different kind of gratitude. Not only for her patriotism, which has already come at a cost, but for how she allowed the slow work of history to inform a fast-moving political situation that was rapidly becoming a crisis.</p><p>In this case, the history was a little-known story about the vexed election of Abraham Lincoln, embedded in a book I wrote in 2020, <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/lincoln-on-the-verge-thirteen-days-to-washington-ted-widmer/10353936?ean=9781476739441">Lincoln on the Verge: Thirteen Days to Washingt

<p>Preserves make great presents, they look pretty all wrapped up and they keep for ages: cranberry chutney, Campari candied grapefruit peel, and raspberry jam with candied citrus and star anise</p><p>Pretty jars of jam, chutney or candied peel tuck easily into stockings and make excellent host gifts, too.

<p>Refresh crusty old sweets by infusing them with a bottle of hooch</p><p>There’s no sweet or candy that’s too sugary, sour, colourful or flavoursome to infuse with vodka, so if you’ve ever got a half-eaten packet of marshmallows, toffee or jelly beans, say, try infusing them with a spirit and turn them into a homemade, candy-infused drink. Once bottled, they make a great gift, and are perfect for a secret Santa or dinner party present.</p><p>In fact, all sorts of store-cupboard ingredients infuse well with spirits, too. I’ve had a jar of stem ginger in sweet syrup sitting at the back of the cupboard for a couple of years now, well out of date and without any discernible use, so I mixed it with vodka and a spent vanilla pod, and was surprised by how delicious the result was, both neat and super-cold from the freezer and mixed with soda, ice and a wedge of lime. I’ve also recently made marshmallow vodka to use up a packet of deflated and slightly crusty marshmallows.</p> <a href="htt
