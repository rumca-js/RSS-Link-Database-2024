The Orange Box was one of the greatest deals in gaming on its release in 2007. Cramming five Valve-developed classics onto one disc - Half Life 2, Half Life 2 Episode 1, Episode 2, Team Fortress 2, and introducing the original Portal - the quality bar was supremely high. Originally shipping on the 360 at native 720p resolution, Xbox One X enhancements delivered a 9x resolution increase, offering up a native 4K presentation that naturally transitioned over to Series X and thanks to some config file tweakery, it's now possible to remove the 30fps cap, to play Valve's finest at 60fps on Xbox Series X and Series S hardware.

However, to revisit these games today on console is fraught with issues if you're on Xbox. Firstly, the Orange Box has been removed entirely from the Xbox marketplace as of 23rd February 2023. It simply ca

Our programmer Fred Williams bought a copy of the shareware version in the Game store on Leamington high street - you could download it for free, but back then the internet was super slow and super expensive, unlike Game, which was convenient and super expensive. Indeed one of the cleverest business decisions John Romero made was allowing software companies with already established retail channels to box up and sell Shareware Doom at no charge from Id Software. It allowed the game to go viral at a time when "going viral"
