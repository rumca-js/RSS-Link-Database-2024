Every print is still a learning event for me.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Airborneiron"> /u/Airborneiron </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/18ehad7/had_my_first_failure_on_a_long_print/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/18ehad7/had_my_first_failure_on_a_long_print/">[comments]</a></span>
