KMT Presidential Candidate's Proposal Scares Taiwan's Young People", "description": "#Chinainsights#Chinanews\nAfter two terms of President Tsai Ing-wen, a Green Party member, the DPP is no longer a novelty. Therefore, the shared slogan of both the Blue and White camps is: \"Change of political parties, DPP out\". Especially the blue camp, the KMT, has huge media resources, because behind this party stands the Beijing government. The Beijing government has invested a huge amount of money in foreign propaganda.\nThe KMT's logic is that only by cooperating with the CCP on many fronts and by not provoking the CCP will there be peace in Taiwan, and that peace is the prerequisite for a happy life for the people of Taiwan. \n\nHave questions?
