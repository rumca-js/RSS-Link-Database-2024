It’s clear that the people involved with this game tried to capitalize on the recognition of The Lord of the Rings and mesh that with the recent burst in popularity of survival games to create a video game, but  Return to Moria lacks in quality. It’s not a fun game, and it’s even worse that the developer didn’t put any real effort into fixing these problems with the console release.

Others are advised to skip this game since you will find a much better and more entertaining experience with other survival games.
