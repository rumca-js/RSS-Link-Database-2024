Sonic Dream Team reviewed by Chris Reed on iPhone, iPad, and MacBook Air, also available on Apple TV.

Sonic Dream Team packs a surprising amount of fun into a limited number of levels. By having you complete a diverse set of missions within them, it manages to keep things feeling fresh from start to finish even as you play through the same areas numerous times. Its missions are engaging enough that it’s hard not to go back and finish off any you missed right after conquering Eggman. While the music and story presentation could have been better, and the touchscreen controls aren’t ideal as the difficulty increases toward the end, Sonic Dream Team has still sped onto the list of fantastic recent 3D platformers.

In today's Fix of entertainment news:
Anthony Mackie was at The Game Awards last night, and right before he presented the award for Best Ongoing Game, he dropped an update to his Twisted Metal live-action series. Yes, a Season 2 is coming, and it shouldn't be too much of a surprise as the series has proved to be a success for Universal's Peacock service. In other streaming service news, Disney+ will be airing a documentary about legendary game designer Hideo Kojima. Hideo Kojima: Connecting Worlds premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival earlier this year, but will arrive on the Disney service in 2024. And finally, the Oscars have revealed a list of 20 films elligible to win the Best Visual Effects award, and summer pop culture phenomenon, Oppenheimer, isn't one of them.

## Why Insomniac's Spider-Man 2 Didn't Win At The Game Awards - IGN Daily Fix

Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 seemed like it was primed to take home some trophies from The Game Awards , but  surprisingly, Insomniac’s critically acclaimed sequel took home nothing. Out of 7 nominations, our friendly neighborhood spider couldn’t do whatever a spider can to win, being outdone by some of the other popular games in each category it was in. Spider-Man 2 fans aren’t happy about this, as the PlayStation exclusive had major hype behind it leading up to its release. #SpiderMan2 was outdone by Baldur’s Gate 3 at #TheGameAwards, but the #TGAs could look different for Insomniac when the Wolverine game drops. Plus, there’s a CoD of War brewing over a joke Chris Judge made about Modern Warfare on stage last night - some folks aren’t too happy with Kratos. And a breakdown of the biggest awards and surprises from this year’s Game Awards.
