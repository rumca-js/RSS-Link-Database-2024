<p>Amazon filed a motion on Friday in the Western Washington district court asking a judge to dismiss the Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC) antitrust lawsuit against it.

<p>OctoML says it has ended its business relationship with Civitai days after an investigation by <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.404media.co/a16z-funded-ai-platform-generated-images-that-could-be-categorized-as-child-pornography-leaked-documents-show/"><em>404 Media</em></a> revealed the text-to-image platform was being used to generate images that “could be categorized as child pornography.” Civitai previously relied on OctoML’s OctoAI for image generation. While OctoML initially indicated it would continue working with Civitai and introduced new measures to curb the creation of harmful images, <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.404media.co/civitai-and-octoml-introduce-radical-new-measures-to-stop-abuse-after-404-media-investigation/"><em>404 Media</em></a> reported on Saturday that it has now decided to cut ties with the platform altogether.</p>

<p>The Beeper Mini team has apparently been working around the clock to resolve the <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/beeper-minis-imessage-integration-is-on-the-fritz-211712651.html"><ins>outage affecting the new “iMessage on Android” app</ins></a>, and says a fix is “very close.” And once the fix rolls out, users’ seven-day free trials will be reset so they can start over fresh. Beeper Mini was released earlier this week, and seemed an especially promising entrant due to its unique approach to bridging the iMessage-Android gap. The app, reportedly the result of <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/beeper-says-it-reverse-engineered-imessage-into-an-android-app-172250419.html">a 16-year-old’s work to reverse-engineer iMessage</a>, routes messages directly through Apple’s own servers, making it <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/sunbird-shuts-down-its-imessage-app-for-android-after-major-privacy-concerns-1607133

<p>Between <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fortnite-aims-at-the-survival-builder-crown-with-its-new-lego-mode-151433897.html"><em>Fortnite’s</em></a> propensity for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/coachella-is-coming-back-to-fortnite-in-a-bigger-way-this-year-130021748.html">big-name concerts</a> and Epic’s purchase of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/epic-games-buys-harmonix-184001622.html">Harmonix</a> two years ago, the inclusion of some kind of music-making feature in the game was inevitable. What Epic is releasing today is actually far grander: an entirely new mode called Fortnite Festival, a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fortnite-party-worlds-epic-metaverse-142555354.html">social space</a> where players can team up to perform their favorite songs or jam together on new mixes.</p>

<p>Good morning. Do you want this <a href="https://www.engadget.com/feast-your-eyes-on-this-ps1-themed-playstation-5-080926381.html">customized PS5</a>? You'll have to work the sunset years of your career at Sony then. That is, apparently, the only way. I'm also taking bets on which chatbot will be the chatbot we all depend on. It's like Yahoo (our parent company) or Google or Facebook. Who's going to get there first? This week's YouTube-coated cry for help features two of the biggest chatbot competitors, Google and Microsoft.
