The Nintendo Switch is approaching its twilight years as persistent rumors of a successor start to seem imminent. You wouldn't know it's on its way out from the library, though, as this year is one of the strongest that the little console-handheld hybrid has ever seen.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">This year, the system put its biggest names forward with both a long-anticipated sequel to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, as well as a new mainline Super Mario Bros. game. We also got excellent remakes like Metroid Prime Remastered, and some notable third-party support. For this list, we considered all console exclusives, meaning games on Switch and PC were eligible, although this year, everything we selected ", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-best-nintendo-switch-exclusive-games-of-2023/2900-4979", "date_published": "2023-12-09T18:00:00+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "GameSpot", "album": "GameSpot", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null, "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Firearms Expert Reacts To The Order: 1886\u2019s Guns", "description": "<img height=\"480\" src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_medium/1574/15746725/4231453-order_1886_site.jpg\" width=\"480\" /> Jonathan Ferguson, a weapons expert and Keeper of Firearms &amp; Artillery at the Royal Armouries, breaks down more of the weaponry of The Order: 1886, including the M2 'Falchion' Auto-Rifle, the Three Crown Coach Gun, and the M86 Thermite Rifle.", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/videos/firearms-expert-reacts-to-the-order-1886s-guns/2300-6463010", "date_published": "2023-12-09T16:00:00+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "GameSpot", "album": "GameSpot", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null, "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Epic Won't Call This Fortnite 2, But It Feels That Way To Me", "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Ask someone who doesn't play <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/\">Fortnite </a>what they know about the game and they're likely to mention a few things. There are all the funny emotes; no doubt they know that part. It's got that dancing banana fella--he's pretty cool. They'll probably also call it a shooting game or, if they know the term, they'll call it a battle royale game. It's true that for six years, battle royale has been the centerpiece to Fortnite, but in that time, it's also grown as a platform, with 70% of Fortnite players now also routinely playing in Creative mode, the game's user-generated content sandbox with an ever-growing number and breadth of experiences.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">But for anyone who didn't yet know Fortnite was already more than a battle royale game, this week's huge update, complete with three new games, beloved IP, and well-established studios, feels like a statement.

As is the case with all games like this, there's a meaningful learning curve involved in getting started. Yes, there's a tutorial, but it's also an open-world sandbox game in which it's very easy to get distracted by some new thing and lose track of what you were <em>supposed </em>to be doing.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">While questions like \"where do I get wooden planks?\" and other specific questions about where to find resources will come up after you've been playing for a while, the struggle in the really early goings is just in understanding Lego Fortnite's fundamental logic. In other words: How does this thing work? Every game has its own unique answers to that question, and it usually requires spending time with it to figure them out", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/lego-fortnite-tips-and-tricks/2900-4985", "date_published": "2023-12-09T15:03:00+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "GameSpot", "album": "GameSpot", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null, "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}]
