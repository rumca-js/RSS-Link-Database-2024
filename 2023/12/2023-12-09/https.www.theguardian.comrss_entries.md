<p>Pep Guardiola’s champions were on the ropes at Villa Park but believe victory at Kenilworth Road could spark a run of glory</p><p>Sometimes, according to Pep Guardiola, “you need a punch in the face” to see how you react. Manchester City have received a metaphorical blow after four games without a win in the Premier League to derail their challenge for a fourth successive title. There is no shame in drawing against Chelsea, Liverpool and Tottenham, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/dec/06/aston-villa-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report" title="">nor losing to a fantastic Aston Villa side</a> away, but this will be the month when City’s desire is truly tested.</p><p>They begin a run of winnable games at Luton on Sunday and then, across the next 10 matches, go on to meet eight teams that began the weekend in the bottom half of the table. Given those fixtures, there is every chance City could enjoy three months of accumulating points after a difficult period.

<ul><li>Pool 1: Bulls 27-16 Saracens</li><li>Farrell makes club return after announcing Six Nations break</li></ul><p>Saracens flew off to Pretoria happy to find some winter sun but this was a blast of cold reality. The Bulls fancy their chances of becoming the first South African side to win Europe’s Champions Cup and it is easy to see why. Most opponents leave the Loftus Versfeld Stadium empty handed and the three-times champions were no exception.</p><p>Of course, no team with Owen Farrell in their side will be a pushover. The fly-half we now have to call England’s former captain was making his return to club colours after the bombshell announcement that he was side-stepping the Six Nations. Saracens were always competitive but the writing was on the wall at the interval when they were 14 points down. At altitude and against a team with this much power in their pack and guile behind the scrum, this was always going to be a mountain to climb on the Highveld.</p> <a href="https://ww

It had been an exhausting, ridiculous game. Melbourne Croatia had finished top of the regular-season table, had been the better side on the day, had taken the lead, had seemed to be on their way to the title, only to concede in the 88th minute. South Melbourne had missed three penalties in the shootout.</p><p>Melbourne Croatia twice had kicks for the match. Postecoglou had to convert the fifth penalty to keep his side in it.

## John McGinn sinks Arsenal to deliver another statement win for Aston Villa

<p>How do you top reducing the kings to pawns? It was a question on the lips of the Aston Villa supporters basking in these rather heady days and a conundrum for Unai Emery, their almost untouchable manager, to solve. The simple answer is a club-record 15th straight home league victory, one that came against the erstwhile leaders, Arsenal. John McGinn’s early strike was sufficient to move Villa – who survived a late VAR check when Arsenal had a goal ruled out for handball against Kai Havertz – to within two points of the summit and one behind Arsenal. Perhaps Villa really are bona fide title contenders, as Pep Guardiola suggested in midweek.</p><p>For the second time in four days, Villa Park played host to a mouthwatering contest. After Villa’s evisceration of champions Manchester City in midweek, it was impossible not to wonder whether they would have the might – mentally as well as physically – to perform again at full tilt again.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2

In cities and in towns, a growing number of rough sleepers are living through another British winter; some of them will die in it. In rain and sleet and wind and long hours of darkness, in doorways, under bridges, down alleys, on benches (where bars have not been added to prevent them), in makeshift tents (if these have not been removed by authorities), in sleeping bags, with dogs for protection and companionship, with others sometimes, but mostly alone and lonely, never private but usually ignored, they are in our blind sight.</p><p>What we often do not see are the female rough sleepers.

<p>The retiring east London lord of the manor bought his feudal title in 1989 and says it once saved him from sharing a bed with a golfing buddy</p><p>On Wednesday the lord of Walthamstow, an 82-year-old retired estate agent named Phillip Leigh, is putting his title up for auction.

You might be able to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/mar/21/revealed-link-life-peerages-party-donations" title="">buy a peer</a>, but you can’t buy a peerage. A lordship is not a peerage. It doesn’t come with a place in the House of Lords, there’s no land, and, although they are known as “lord of the manor” titles, there’s also no manor.</p><p>Still, as Leigh is quick to point out, unlike many off-the-peg lordships, his one goes back a long way.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/dec/09/manor-lord-walthamstow-east-london-auctioning-feudal-title">Continue reading...</a>

The gulf in resources between the two clubs is vast – the Premier League newcomers’ entire squad is worth an estimated £75m, or three-quarters of Jack Grealish.

<p>The maestro-power of Jeff Stelling cannot save <em>Every Game Every Goal</em> from feeling like being stabbed in the eyes with a needle covered in football</p><p>As Johan Cruyff once pointed out, in football the clock is always your enemy. If you’re winning the clock moves too slowly. If you’re losing it’s always going too fast. The clock only really tells you two things: how much chasing you still have to do, and how much longer you’re going to be chased. This is the source of its power too. In a game that has no formal structure beyond the half-time break, no set phases, just the steady depletion of time, the clock is key to the entire spectacle, the ultimate source of all tension, fear, pain, joy.</p><p>All of which perhaps explains why Amazon Prime’s Every Game Every Goal show is, for all the undimmed maestro-power of Jeff Stelling, the most painful, jarring and genuinely exhausting football programme ever devised.
