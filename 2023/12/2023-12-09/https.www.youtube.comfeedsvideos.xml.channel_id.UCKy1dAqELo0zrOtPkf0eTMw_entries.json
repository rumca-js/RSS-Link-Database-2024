Spider-Man 2 fans aren\u2019t happy about this, as the PlayStation exclusive had major hype behind it leading up to its release. #SpiderMan2 was outdone by Baldur\u2019s Gate 3 at #TheGameAwards, but the #TGAs could look different for Insomniac when the Wolverine game drops. Plus, there\u2019s a CoD of War brewing over a joke Chris Judge made about Modern Warfare on stage last night - some folks aren\u2019t too happy with Kratos.
