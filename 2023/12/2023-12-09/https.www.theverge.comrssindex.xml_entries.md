  <p id="CnLqeo">Tesla will release its 2023 Holiday Update next week with a few big changes, including one that lets Teslas call 911 automatically if the car’s airbags deploy in a crash. On Thursday, the <a href="https://x.com/Tesla/status/1732980835740242194?s=20">company announced the update</a> is coming next week, and it highlighted other coming features like Apple Podcasts support, rear-screen Bluetooth headset support, an updated version of the park assistance with 3D visuals, and new blind spot indicators.</p>

  <p id="J3glsQ">You could say that <em>Fortnite </em>is entering a new phase. With the launch of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/7/23990660/lego-fortnite-release-epic"><em>Lego Fortnite</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/8/23993494/catch-some-air"><em>Rocket Racing</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/23756615"><em>Fortnite Festival</em></a>, the game is now more than a popular battle royale — it’s a platform designed to house lots of different kinds of experiences. That shift was preceded by an event that brought the game back to its roots with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/3/23943701/fortnite-og-new-season-tilted-towers-bal

  <p id="nj0lFu">A few months ago, I downgraded my internet, going from a 900Mbps plan to a 200Mbps one. Now, I find that websites can sometimes take a painfully long time to load, that HD YouTube videos have to stop and buffer when I jump around in them, and that video calls can be annoyingly choppy.</p>
<p id="oR5zCl">In other words, pretty much nothing has changed. I had those exact same problems even when I had near-gigabit download service, and I’m probably not alone. I’m sure many of you have also had the experience of cursing a slow-loading website an

  <p id="jUtY1X">We’ve found Apple’s latest generation of its base-model iPad to be a bit awkwardly priced from the start. At $449 it’s a little close to the much nicer iPad Air and simultaneously a lot pricier than its ninth-gen predecessor. But that all looks different when you knock a Benjamin off of it — because right now you can get the <strong>10th-gen iPad</strong> with base 64GB of storage <a href="https://howl.me/clauS55rqAx">for $349 ($100 off)</a> or expanded 256GB for <a href="https://howl.me/clauTMjw3cT">$499 (also $100 off)</a> at Best Buy until Dec
