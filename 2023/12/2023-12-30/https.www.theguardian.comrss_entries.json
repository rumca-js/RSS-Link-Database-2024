This year we\u2019re going to rewatch <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/07/parasite-review-bong-joon-ho-south-korean-satire\">Parasite</a>, the Oscar-winning Korean film from which I\u2019ve borrowed inspiration for today\u2019s recipe. In the film, <em>ram-don</em> is a combination of two sets of Korean instant noodles, <em>chapagetti</em> and <em>neoguri</em>, part ramen and part udon. The end result tastes, much like my hope for the new year, sweet, spicy and exciting.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/dec/30/vegan-ram-don-noodles-recipe-black-garlic-leek-tenderstem-meera-sodha\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/dec/30/vegan-ram-don-noodles-recipe-black-garlic-leek-tenderstem-meera-sodha", "date_published": "2023-12-30T12:00:34+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "The Guardian", "album": "The Guardian", "user": null, "language": "en-UK", "thumbnail": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/guardian-logo-rss.c45beb1bafa34b347ac333af2e6fe23f.png", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "US threatens to sue Texas over law allowing state police to arrest migrants", "description": "<p>SB4, scheduled to go into effect on 5 March, is one of the strictest immigration laws ever passed in American history</p><p>The US Department of Justice has threatened to sue the state of Texas if it implements a law that would allow state police to arrest any person deemed suspicious of crossing the border illegally.</p><p>The law, called Senate bill 4, is scheduled to go into effect on 5 March.
