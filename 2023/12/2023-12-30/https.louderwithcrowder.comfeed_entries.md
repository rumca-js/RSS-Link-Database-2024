Well, not shopping, as much as to creep on other people shopping. And to drop another video encouraging young people to cut off their families. Jeffrey is your family now. </p><p>Happy Holidays.</p><p>"If you have no family, you can be in my family. If you needed to go no contact or limited contact, I love you very much."</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
