<p>The Magpies manager needs results but his side face Liverpool, City and Villa in the league – and Sunderland in the FA Cup</p><p>When results go awry, football clubs tend to have only one response. Sometimes the act is undertaken with a sense of ruthlessness, sometimes relief, sometimes with the dutiful sombreness of somebody taking a faithful labrador to the vet for the final time, but always there is a feeling of necessity. “I’m sorry, Nigel/Antonio/Steve, but there’s no other way.” Inevitably, though, the result is the same: whatever is going wrong at the club, however good a job has been done before, the manager is the one who takes the blame.</p><p>That is just the nature of the modern game. Managers may just about be given time to work their way through a dip, but nobody ever sees the other side of a slough. Which should concern Eddie Howe.

<p>Just as it appeared Burnley had ended their record as the last team in the Premier League to have gained a point from a losing position, controversy reared its ugly head once more as the referee, Stuart Attwell, awarded the softest of late penalties for Douglas Luiz to convert and so enable Aston Villa to return to winning ways.</p><p>Four minutes of regulation time remained when Aaron Ramsey, the former Villa academy graduate, prepared to clear the ball from midway in his own penalty area. Unbeknown to the Burnley substitute, from over his shoulder appeared Jhon Duran who was only willing to go over the Burnley player’s leg to ground via the merest contact. Attwell pointed to the penalty spot and Douglas Luiz, adding to the drama by taking as long a time as possible to compose himself and test James Trafford’s nerve, eventually rattled the crossbar with a shot that only belatedly crossed the line.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/dec/30/aston-villa-burnley-p

<p>Everton started the month with four consecutive wins and finished it with three losses to remind them of the precarious position their 10-point deduction has left them in. They were outclassed by Wolves who made it eight unbeaten at home on an afternoon where the grieving Mario Lemina was honoured by his teammates.</p><p>Wolves have come a long way in the space of a year. When 2022 ended they found themselves in the relegation zone, 12 months on they are 13 points clear of trouble and playing impressive football under Gary O’Neil. Everton, however, are a solitary point above the drop zone with a difficult run ahead.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/dec/30/wolves-everton-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<ul><li>Northampton 21-17 Sale</li><li>Hosts fight back after disappointing first half</li></ul><p>It may be a cliche, but this really was a game of two halves. The first was a dire watch, one bereft of spark or inspiration. The second was a riot as two title-chasing teams shook off the fog of perhaps too much Christmas merriment and gave a sell-out crowd what was promised on the tin: five tries, one a decisive penalty try, and a famous home victory that takes Northampton top of the Premiership.</p><p>Both coaches would have had plenty of unpleasant words to share with their charges at the break but at least Sale’s boss, Alex Sanderson, had a seven-pointer to help the medicine go down. That came in the 38th minute – the game’s first score –thanks to some athletic work from Tom Roebuck, who plucked a high ball on the gallop to set Sale moving in Northampton’s 22. With a penalty advantage, George Ford tucked his shoulder and sucked in a defender, creating space for the onrushing Joe Ca

<p>“We are the champions … of the world” from the Queen standard heralded Manchester City before a victory achieved with the kind of purring confidence that has marked Pep Guardiola’s glittering seven-year tenure. They are up to third, two points behind the leaders, Liverpool, courtesy of goals in either half by Rodri and Julián Álvarez, Sheffield United pummelled all afternoon like so many visitors here are.</p><p>After the five trophies they currently hold were paraded on the pitch by five lucky fans, City’s players got down to the business of trying to win consecutive Premier League games for the first time since early November. The Blades were ideal opponents as they had not won the fixture since City’s home was Maine Road: in 1987 when Chris Wilder was in the XI for a 3-2 Division Two win. And Wilder’s side arrived bottom – five points from the last safe spot and coming off the demoralising 3-2 loss to Luton caused by two late own goals.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/

Britons are grazing on the go and missing meals, but it’s time for people to realise they deserve to eat properly<p>As 2024 looms into view, let’s do a mental exercise. What happened the last time you were hungry? In the mental picture you’re conjuring, are you sitting at a table, staring at a plate of tasty, nourishing food? Because you’re worth it. Or are you at a desk, ramming anything (biscuits, crisps, protein bar) into your mouth, just to stop you fainting?</p><p>Maybe you’re commuting, or speed-walking, grazing as you go, because somehow it’s become the norm that food doesn’t happen on its own, unless for very special occasions. Meals, plates, tables, cutlery – these are half-remembered dreams from the “before times”. Food has become a secondary, multitasking concern: something to be consumed as quickly as possible, while you’re doing something else, or on the way to somewhere else.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/dec/30/step-away-from-crisps-genera

<p><a href="https://doublekoek.com/">Daniel Gebhart de Koekkoek</a> isn’t sure how he ended up shooting a calendar. The Austrian photographer and director’s main work was campaigns for the likes of Apple and Adidas, so he was confused when a Viennese art publisher asked him to shoot one. “Half in fun I told them: ‘Sure, let’s do a cat calendar.’” Inspired by <em><a href="https://www.moma.org/collection/works/47919">Dalí Atomicus</a></em> (1948), a photograph by Salvador Dalí and Philippe Halsman, featuring the surrealist artist and three flying felines, the Jumping Cats series was born. De Koekkoek says his subjects’ amazing acrobatics are just what cats do when you’re not looking. “At first they were sceptical about me hanging out with them 24/7, but after a while they didn’t care. They started jumping and dancing around the house.”</p><ul><li><a href="http://doublekoek.com/jc">Jumping Cats is available as an everlasting calendar</a></li></ul> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/ar

Estelle is a dealer in decorative items, homewares and furniture from the 1970s, and has spent her adult life tracking down the gems of design from that decade. By 2015, when she moved in to live with Steve in his “slightly studenty” Edwardian end-of-terrace that had once been a corner shop, she had amassed enough chrome, smoked glass and teak to fill a house. Fortunately, Steve, a sound and lighting engineer who already owned a G-Plan sideboard, also liked vintage and was totally on board with her vision.</p><p>Today Estelle and Steve’s home, which they also rent out as a location house, is a colourful imagining of glamorous 1970s living.

<p>Russian director Kirill Serebrennikov’s hallucinogenic portrait is a punishing, but admirably ambitious revisionist period piece</p><p>The unhappy union between the composer Pyotr Tchaikovsky (Odin Biron) and his wife, Antonina Miliukova (Alyona Mikhailova), is the jumping-off point for the latest film from the Russian director Kirill Serebrennikov (<em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/13/petrovs-flu-review-a-febrile-deeply-russian-head-trip">Petrov’s Flu</a></em>). But like Ken Russell’s <em>The Music Lovers</em>, which explored the same story back in 1971, this film has only a passing acquaintance with the historical facts of Tchaikovsky’s turbulent life. While Russell’s film took the (admittedly entertaining) route of vulgar excess, Serebrennikov’s exploration of the story has a feverish, hallucinogenic quality. The marital disaster zone is populated with a chorus of naked Russian hunks; it features a talking corpse and a climactic dance sequence. It’s a punis

Did Chelsea switch off after Cole Palmer ran through to score his second of the afternoon? Did they think that Luton, who had already given Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester City a run for their money at Kenilworth Road, would lie down?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/dec/30/luton-chelsea-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

They left disconsolate; Philippe Clement finally sampling defeat in his 17th match in charge. The further bad news for Clement is Celtic are likely to strengthen considerably in January. Celtic were not altogether convincing here and were given a fright by James Tavernier’s late free-kick. In this fixture, though, result is everything.

<p>What to expect in Gaza, Ukraine, the US elections, China, Europe and the rest of the world</p><p>The year 2024 will be a critical one.

But there are some reasons for cautious optimism.</p><p>With so much happening, it can be hard to know where to look.

But when you have changed the world, what comes next?</p><p>You can tell a Nintendo game not just from its feel – the satisfying swish of Link’s sword in the Zelda games, the weight of Mario’s jump – but by its look. They are bright, energetic, characterful. In Splatoon, the game-maker’s most recent hit series, the shooter is reimagined as teams of transforming squids splattering arenas in glossy paint. Mario’s red cap and blue overalls, originally designed to create a recognisable character with just a few pixels for 1981’s arcade hit Donkey Kong, is now a stylistic signature – Nintendo’s logo is the same shade of red. When you look into the company’s department store outlets in Japan, a dozen colourful characters stare back at you from reams of merch: Animal Crossing cookware, Super Mario gloves, Zelda wallets and ties, Pikmin vases.</p><p>Next

One is to go all out – cue an entire baked cheese, not least because we know, come the stroke of midnight, we’re all granted a clean and shiny new slate, right? Second, stick to old-school classics, which in my book means chipolatas, full stop. And the third? The third is for those who by this stage of festive proceedings are craving something that’s deliciously, nutritiously green.

## The healthy guide to being selfish: ‘It’s OK to not meet other people’s needs’

<p>Putting yourself first is taboo, but do it right and it could make you (and your friends) happier</p><p>In day-to-day life, there are two kinds of selfishness. One is where you don’t give a damn about anyone else and what they need or want, and just go after what you want, whenever it feels good to do so. This is the kind of selfishness that gives the word a bad rep. The second is just about prioritising our own needs, and articulating them.</p><p>We’ve misunderstood the value of selfishness. That isn’t terribly surprising, given that most major religions have always framed it as a vice, with kindness almost always presented as an unequivocal good. But overemphasising the primacy of kindness can make us feel as if we can never put ourselves first, even when we really need to. Kindness is one of the oils that keeps society moving. But it’s not a cost-free behaviour to demand of other people, or of ourselves. You – we, I – get to be top of the pile every now and then.</p> <a href="h

The splendid capital rises from its Mediterranean bay in improbable layers, from the arches of the French colonial port to the warren of the Casbah, to the clear blue sky, all overlooked by the Martyrs’ Memorial, which represents the country’s fight for independence. “Never was town more nobly placed,” wrote <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/oct/23/classics.algeria">Edith Wharton</a>, who visited by yacht in 1888. In the cabin, my toddler son was still sleeping. I looked at him and thought, we’ve made it, baby: all the way from West Yorkshire to north Africa by rail and sea in 48 hours.</p><p>The journey would have been familiar to British travellers of the 19th century who arrived here by steamship, but these days

<p>Outcome of election scheduled for 13 January could lead to vastly different scenarios with Beijing next year</p><p>Taiwan’s election on 13 January is the first of more than 40 national elections to be held around the world in 2024. It will determine the presidency and legislature governing 23.5 million people on an island that is similar in size to Belgium. But it has major implications for the world.</p><p>There are a host of issues for Taiwan’s voters, including the cost of living, housing and labour rights, energy, education, and elderly care. Taiwan has an ageing population and there is a significant wealth gap, with low minimum wages. The domestic campaign so far has seen standard cross-party sniping over competing promises, accusations of misconduct and corruption, and endless scandals ranging from allegedly plagiarised theses to charges of secret second nationalities.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/30/taiwan-election-new-president-growing-threat-chi

<p>New year, new feast: take a cue from Mexico and spice things up by making excellent use surplus or stale tortillas or nachos</p><p>Brighten up New Year’s Day with this Mexican <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2021/oct/16/why-you-need-migas-recipe-in-your-life-to-use-stale-bread-loaf-zero-waste-cooking-recipe">migas</a> brunch. Upcycle leftover soft tortilla wraps (or stale nachos) in minutes by simply frying them up with some <em>huevos revueltos</em> (scrambled eggs) and a little tomato. Mexican migas are very similar to the classic Spanish and Portuguese dish of fried stale breadcrumbs, only using tortillas instead of old bread. They’re a bit like <em>chilaquiles</em>, which <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/dec/14/how-turn-christmas-party-leftovers-mexican-brunch">I wrote about a few years ago</a>, though with a few key differences: Mexican migas are made with torn strips of stale tortillas, and the eggs are scrambled together with the crisp fried tortilla
