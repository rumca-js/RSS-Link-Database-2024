<p>Vizio TVs’ “effective” refresh rates have been confusing customers for years, and the company may now owe payments to some buyers who were misled by the term. As spotted by <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/30/24019780/vizio-settlement-effective-refresh-rate-class-action-lawsuit"><em><ins>The Verge</ins></em></a>, Vizio recently <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.refreshrateclassaction.com/"><ins>agreed to settle</ins></a> a class action lawsuit in California over what plaintiffs claim is “false and misleading” advertising. While some Vizio TVs are marketed as having a “120Hz Effective Refresh Rate” or “240Hz Effective Refresh Rate,” that describes a result achieved using motion clarity technology. Their actual, native refresh rate in most cases is 60Hz.</p>
<p>Vizio has <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.refreshrateclassaction.com/docs/2023.11.09%20-%20Second%20Amended%20VIZIO%20Settlement%20Agreement%20(signed%20by%20Ps).

<p>NASA’s campaign to gather names for a sort of “message in a bottle” that will fly with its upcoming Europa Clipper mission closes after this weekend, so if you were hoping to participate but haven’t yet made your submission, you’d better hurry up and do so. The signatures will accompany a poem written for Europa by US Poet Laureate Ada Limón, which will be engraved in Limón’s handwriting on a metal plate attached to the spacecraft. Europa, one of Jupiter’s largest moons, is thought to have a deep saltwater ocean beneath its icy crust  — and there, the conditions could be suitable for microbial life.</p>
<p>To enter the Message in a Bottle campaign, you just need to go to <a href="https://europa.nasa.gov/message-in-a-bottle/sign-on/"><ins>NASA’s website</ins></a> and fill out a short signup form. The deadline is tomorrow, December 31. So far, more than 2.4 million people have added their names. According to NASA, the names of everyone who participated will be stenciled in tiny, tin

<p>What do you do when the tech world mostly grinds to a halt at the end of December? You reheat your hot takes, force a narrative thread on a company's ups and downs and edit it all up for consumption.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, it's a little quiet at the end of the year (barring <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-is-selling-its-contested-watch-models-again-after-import-ban-pause-193824245.html">Apple Watch bans</a>), but that won't stop TMA from finding something for me to talk to himself about. We’re looking at a few of the major stories from the last 12 months and .. some other things where I just has to say my piece. And if not on a short YouTube video that's clipped, cropped and pushed into socials, then where? <a href="https://www.engadget.com/how-twitter-died-in-2023-and-why-x-may-not-be-far-behind-143033036.html">On X</a>?

<p>A few days ago, Microsoft released a standalone Android app for Microsoft Copilot, giving you a quick way to access the AI assistant. Turns out the iOS and iPad versions weren't far behind, because they're now <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-copilot/id6472538445?platform=iphone">available from Apple's App Store</a>. Just like in Copilot on desktop and other AI chatbots, such as ChatGPT, you can type in your question and wait for responses generated by artificial intelligence. In Copilot's case, you'll get responses spun by OpenAI's GPT-4, the company's latest large language model. The free version of ChatGPT, in comparison, is powered by the older ChatGPT-3.5, and you'll need to pay for ChatGPT Plus to get access to the newer model.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, Copilot on iOS has the capability to turn your words into images. That particular feature is powered by <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-next-dall-e-will-be-able-to-generate-resu
