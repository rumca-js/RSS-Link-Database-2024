Sometimes I want to live like a fishy. A fishy man. Fishy man under the water. Club club, fish. Houses. House underwater fish. Sometimes I wish I were fish.

Man is like fish.

Air is like sea.

Above the sea.

Under the sea.

Me.


In the future I think people wonâ€™t live in underwater cities, but I figure I might as well cover the history of the predictions where people thought we might. 

Let us laugh at their misguided ideals of what would never be.

Haha he he.
