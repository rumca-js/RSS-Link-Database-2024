Why government is lying flat?", "description": "#Chinainsights#Gansuearthquake#chinanews \nA shallow 6.2 magnitude earthquake struck a county in Gansu Province. The quake rippled through neighboring Qinghai Province. Local officials said 131 people were killed, and nearly 15,000 houses collapsed. But within 15 hours, it was announced that the rescue was over and that rescue teams from out of town had been told to stand down. Generally, after an earthquake, there are at least 24 hours of golden rescue time.\nOn November 4, 2023, a 6.4-magnitude earthquake struck western Nepal, and the search and rescue work ended 36 hours after the quake. So, why did the earthquake in China end in such a hurry? Shouldn't more people be rescued, the more, the better? In this episode, we'll look at what the Beijing government is trying to cover up behind the scenes of this earthquake. \n\nHave questions? Do you have something to share with us about China?
