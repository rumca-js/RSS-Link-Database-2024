Leonardo DiCaprio is by far one of the biggest movie stars on the planet.  Though after his initial foray into the Hollywood machine, it seemed the young Leonardo DiCaprio was forever going to be typecast as the teenage heart throb. That is until he made his turn in Scorsese's Gangs of New York.  Gangs of New York showed the world that Leonardo DiCaprio was capable of so much more.  Leading to roles in The Departed, Django Unchained, The Wolf of Wall Street, The Revenant, and countless other classics.
