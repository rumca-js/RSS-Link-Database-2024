The idea isn’t too bad: it’s about a former US special forces soldier who gets caught up in a South American coup after being hired as bodyguard to a journalist. You can picture Armando Iannucci running with the satirical possibilities, or a more serious-minded film-maker wading knee-deep into moral murk, John le Carré style. Instead, Morel, working with a script by Jacob Lentz, squanders the basic concept – not to mention the gym time that wrestler-turned-actor John Cena put in to get the upper body of a Greek god.</p><p>Cena plays Mason Pettits, a military veteran struggling with post-army life and bored of his going-nowhere new career as a lawyer.

Their resulting debut, Aykathani Malakon (An Angel Woke Me), thoroughly embodies their originating influences, whipping up kosmische, post-punk, psych rock, free jazz and Levantine folklore into an alchemical tour de force delivered with a defiant, DIY disposition.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/dec/25/the-five-star-albums-we-missed-this-year">Continue reading...</a>

Lash extensions take <a href="https://theblinkbar.com/lash-fills/">two-three hours</a> to apply and last up to a month. Done well, they look natural, in particular the <a href="https://heymelashes.com/ellipse-lash-extensions/">Ellipse flat lashes</a>, which have forked ends to double the appearance of volume without adding weight.

Minnesota briefly took a 21-17 lead early in the third quarter before Detroit quarterback Jared Goff found Amon-Ra St Brown for a touchdown that put them up front.

Structured around this journey, Manuel Bauer’s documentary debut weaves a vivid tapestry of experiences that captures the complex sociopolitical fabric of contemporary Peru.</p><p>Dominating these intimate anecdotes, which are spread across regions, is the influence of the mining industry. Manuel, a middle-aged native of Cerro de Pasco, speaks of how his friends and relatives have either died of lead poisoning or chosen to migrate to other towns.

Our dogs, in particular, have been an acceptable outlet for emotions and impulses we otherwise keep strictly controlled – our latent desire to be demonstratively affectionate, to be silly and chat to strangers. If this seems like an exaggeration, consider the different reactions you’d get if you struck up a conversation with someone in a park with a dog, versus someone on the train.</p><p>Indeed, British society has been set up to accommodate these four-legged ambassadors.

<p>She finally said goodbye to her Calder Valley classic this year. But why did her star beg for the ending to be changed? And why is she so excited about menopausal punks? </p><p>Sally Wainwright is about to rock out on her new electric guitar. She has been learning to play as research for a new BBC drama she is writing. “It’s about a group of menopausal women who form a punk band and sing about their experiences,” she says, catching herself and, to my disappointment, popping the guitar back down in her home office (she keeps it by her desk). The renowned TV writer, who turned 60 this year, describes herself as a “bit of a recluse”. But she is clearly having a hoot with her punk era. “They realise they’ve got a lot to say as women of a certain age – they have a lot of anger.” She can’t stop grinning as she talks. “It’s very ‘feelgood’. I laugh just thinking about it.”</p><p>Guitar lesson aside, Wainwright is here to reflect on the final season of her hit drama Happy Valley, which br

I woke my sisters up early (they were 10 and 13 years older than me, so not quite as excited about Santa), then we made tea and took it into our parents’ bedroom.

Afterwards, we dressed in our festive finery and drove to Auntie Marion and Uncle Martin’s house in time for Christmas dinner, served at midday on the dot.</p><p>And what a dinner it was. We are a family of traditionalists, so it was always turkey and all the trimmings, followed by Christmas pudding. Everything was homemade, from the bread sauce to the brandy butter.
