EVs and plug-in hybrids are on display from every major automaker, with highlights including the Pacific Northwest debut of the&#160;BMW i5&#160;— the first 100%&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/hot-new-electric-vehicles-at-seattle-auto-show-highlight-an-industry-that-isnt-slowing-down/">Read More</a>
