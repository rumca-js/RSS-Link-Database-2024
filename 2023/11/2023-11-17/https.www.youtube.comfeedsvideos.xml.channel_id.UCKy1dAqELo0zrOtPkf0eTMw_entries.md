Loki proved himself as a standout character in Loki Season 2 with an adventure taking him above and beyond how the story started for Loki. Explained simply: he’s grown up and accepted a glorious purpose. In this “Loki” breakdown (which will contain Loki spoilers) we explore how Loki Season 2 (spoilers!) spells when we’ll see Loki again…if we do.

As every Loki episode climbed toward the finale, we thought one fate was at hand for Loki, Miss Minutes, Renslayer, and the rest, but fate laid out a different way for Loki. Easter egg evidence isn’t really there this time, and the Loki/ Victor Timely/Kang story also didn’t present itself as fans expected. If and when we see Kang again, this may actually be the opportunity for us to see the new He Who Remains of this Marvel dimension, Loki, God of Stories himself. 

While most of the Loki episode 5 “ending explained” content pointed one way, the epic journey in Loki Season 2, Episode 6 (finale) pointed elsewhere and just might be one of Marv

In today's Daily Fix:
Square Enix dropped a ton of new info on their upcoming Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth. The second part of the FF7 remake project is getting a few new gameplay mechanics, along with tweaks to existing ones. We also got a new recap video—in case you forgot what happened in the first part—along with images of the game's new characters. In other gaming news, the European ratings board may have leaked the release date of Dragon's Dogma 2. The game isn't too far off, apparently arriving on March 22, 2024. And finally, Microsoft is celebrating the release of Bluey: The Videogame with a one-of-a-kind Bluey-themed Xbox Series X and matching controller. If you just have to have this, check out Microsoft's X account for more details.

So it looks like we might know who actor Steven Yeun is playing in the #MCU. According to Robert Kirkman, who worked with the actor on The Walking Dead and currently on the Invincible animated series, kinda spilled the beans in an interview with comic book artist David Finch. Steven Yeun will make his MCU debut in the upcoming Thunderbolts movie, expected to hit theaters July 25th 2025. Back in 2022 at D23, we got our first look at the #Thunderbolts lineup, which will include Yelena Belova, Red Guardian, US Agent , Bucky Barnes, Ghost, and Taskmaster. And now with Robert Kirkman seemingly ruining the surprise, we now know that Steven Yeun will show up as The Sentry.

Set between the events of Saw I and II, this story finds a sick and desperate John traveling to Mexico for a risky and experimental medical procedure in hopes of obtaining a miracle cure for his cancer – only to discover the entire operation is a scam to defraud the most vulnerable.

Armed with a newfound purpose, John returns to his work, turning the tables on the con artists in his signature visceral way through a series of ingenious and terrifying traps.

IGN's Brian Altano and Cheez-It's very own Cheez play through Super Mario Wonder for the Nintendo Switch. Where exactly are they? Good question. We're not sure. If you have any idea, please let us know because Brian has to shoot at least 3 more videos today and we're running out of time.

Anyway, watch as Brian and Cheez play through the early parts of Super Mario Bros. Wonder. They'll attempt to save the Flower Kingdom alongside Luigi, Peach, Toad, Yoshi, and Daisy - and do their best to put an end to Bowser's reign of terror. But something strange is happening - It appears as though in-game actions can affect the space they seem to occupy. For example, collecting a fire flower in-game and using it seems to send the fireball to the real world. But is this actually the real world? Or a simulation falling apart at the seams? Who put them there and why? I have so many questions. Are they in the Backrooms? What should I have for lunch today? I'm craving cheesy baked snack crackers.

The Hunger Games are back as we return to Panem, this time 64 years before Katniss volunteered as a way to save her sister. The series has long resonated with the teens that read Suzanne Collins’ YA dystopia but how does it hold up today? Released shortly after the first ever iPhone hit the market, it’s a wonder that the original trilogy managed to capture the dangers of our cultural sensationalization of violence in the age of surveillance. 

With The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes hitting theaters, it’s fascinating to track the transformation of Panem from the 10th Games of Lucy Gray Baird (Rachel Zegler) to the 74th Games of Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence). Directed by the man behind the original films, Francis Lawrence, The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes dives into just how Panem’s favorite brutal television program became the glamorous monster it is today. As we live in an age of increasing digital surveillance, the prequel and its predecessors teach us is

Shows and movies featuring Godzilla have always had a little bit of a human problem. Can the new Apple TV+ series help break the monsterverse's human curse? We sat down with Chris Black and Hawkeye creator Matt Fraction to discuss the human element in their upcoming show.

Kurt Russell and Wyatt Russell star alongside Kiersey Clemmons, Anna Sawai, Ren Watabe, Joe Tippet, Anders Holm, Mari Yamamoto and more in this mysterious kaiji-filled adventure.  Not only does the series showcase the origins of Monarch, but gives us a glimpse at the start of the Randa family and how their story is intertwined with the secret organization.

Will Cate and Kentaro Randa be able to unravel the mystery behind their father's disappearance? And, more importantly, will Monarch: Legacy of Monsters be able to solve the monsterverse's human problem? We'll find out on November 17th when the series premieres on Apple TV+.

How does Avatar Frontiers of Pandora combat work? Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora features both Na'vi and human weapons, so we asked Ubisoft to explain why you'd use a bow over an assault rifle. 

By starting with a protagonist who belongs to both Na’vi and human cultures, Massive has been able to build a game with both multiple play styles and environmental texture. We’ll see if that blend works in harmony or if the RDA guns are OP when Frontiers of Pandora launches on December 7, but for now why not check out what we thought of the game so far with our Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora hands-on preview: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3abJDzC8yk
