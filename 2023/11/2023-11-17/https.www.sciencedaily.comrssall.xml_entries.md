In 1973, physicist Phil Anderson hypothesized that the quantum spin liquid, or QSL, state existed on some triangular lattices, but he lacked the tools to delve deeper. Fifty years later, a team has confirmed the presence of QSL behavior in a new material with this structure, KYbSe2.

## Heat tolerant coral may trade fast growth for resilience

Algae living within the soft tissue of coral supply much of the energy needed by their hosts, and some symbiotic algae help coral withstand warmer water better than others. Researchers have now found that there was a tradeoff for corals dominated by the thermally sensitive algae -- they have higher growth, but only in cooler water.

## Future of brain-inspired AI as Python code library passes major milestone

Nature photographers posting to social media are helping improve biodiversity conservation mapping in South Asia, and the method could go global.

## Rediscovery of rare marine amoeba Rhabdamoeba marina

Researchers have rediscovered and successfully cultivatingÂ Rhabdamoeba marina -- a rare marine amoeba that has only been reported in two cases in the past century. Using this culture strain, they performed a comprehensive analysis of its genetic sequence, revealing for the first time the phylogenetic position of this enigmatic amoeba, and proposed a novel taxonomic classification based on their research findings.

## Novel measurement technique for fluid mixing phenomena using selective color imaging method

A novel measurement technique has been developed to visualize the fluid flow and distribution within two droplets levitated and coalesced in space using fluorescence-emitting particles. This technique enabled the estimation of fluid motion within each droplet, thereby revealing the internal flow caused by surface vibration when the droplet merging promotes fluid mixing.

## Discovery of hemoglobin in the epidermis sheds new light on our skin's protective properties

Researchers have shown for the first time that hemoglobin, a protein found in red blood cells where it binds oxygen, is also present in the epidermis, our skin's outermost body tissue. The study provides important insights into the properties of our skin's protective external layer.

## Division of cells in cell cultures and cancer
 - [https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2023/11/231117102436.htm](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2023/11/231117102436.htm)

If cells in cell cultures grow while being treated with division-suppressing agents, their growth becomes excessive and they permanently lose their ability to divide. However, if the cells are treated with a combination of division inhibitors and growth inhibitors, they remain capable of dividing after these substances have been discontinued. The findings could be transferred to certain cancer therapies, but first need to be clinically tested and confirmed.
