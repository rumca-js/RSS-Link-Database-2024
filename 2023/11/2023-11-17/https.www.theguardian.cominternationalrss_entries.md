As the octogenarians gather to enjoy beer and wine during happy hour, they are joined by the youthful faces of New Zealand’s men’s curling team.

<p>More than a year after he became PM voters are still unsure about what kind of leader he is. Will the real Sunak stand up?</p><p>Rishi Sunak has been prime minister for slightly more than a year, but it is probably fair to say that many voters still don’t have much sense of what sort of leader he is. This is, in part, because of his fondness for sometimes contradictory policy resets. But it is also something more fundamental about Sunak, a political opaqueness on to which voters – and MPs – can project their own wishes. So who is the real Sunak?

<p>Social media ‘ghosts’ are increasingly common - and platforms have an incentive to keep those profiles up if they drive engagement</p><p>I burst into tears when my friend tagged me in another Facebook post this morning. My friend died in 2021.

<p>Read by Game of Thrones actor Indira Varma, this satisfying whodunnit is set in the playground of oligarchs, developers and royalty</p><p>Crime writer Ian Rankin’s novella opens with a body in the foyer of a gleaming new residential high rise. Overlooking London’s Hyde Park, the building’s flats are affordable only to the super-rich. The residents – who are now murder suspects – include an art dealer specialising in modern sculpture; the wife of a gangster who is wanted by police; a princess from an unnamed Gulf state, plus her phalanx of bodyguards; a Russian multimillionaire; and, in the penthouse, a property mogul who may or may not be up to his neck in debt. The body is that of the night concierge, Dwaine Hogarth, found by his girlfriend who had come to visit in the middle of his shift. No sooner have the police arrived and begun questioning residents when another corpse is found, this time in the car park in the boot of the Russian’s Bentley.</p><p>Though set in present-day L

Its slender stems, with dark-green pinnate leaves, can stretch up to a generous 6 metres in length and 3 metres across, transforming any space into a botanical sanctuary. Indoors, it gracefully entwines itself around climbing supports, staying beautifully contained. However, what makes this plant a showstopper is its super-fragrant flowers. Delicate, white and star-shaped blossoms emerge in late winter and early spring from an abundance of reddish-pink flower buds.</p><p><strong>Light or shade?<br /></strong>Jasmine thrives in full sunlight or partial shade.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/nov/17/houseplant-of-the-week-white-jasmine">Continue reading...</a>

King Kyrgios: the player who’s been criticized and psychoanalyzed more than anyone else on the ATP Tour today; who’s become almost the dictionary definition of the “divisive tennis star”; whose career has been defined as much by his battles with the media as the men’s Top 10. The villain, the bad boy, the ingrate, the brat. To imagine him putting aside a decade of beef to step behind the mic and assume the honeyed role of the tennis analyst seems faintly incongruous. Yet here he is, in half-profile from his spot on the Tennis Channel set, hands in pockets, relaxed, laughing and joking with Brett Haber and Jim Courier like an old media pro. He’s wearing a dark jacket and a lilac T-shirt. The match comments are delivered with fluent authority. The cadence of panel chat comes easily to him: like a good baseliner, he knows when

Vince Clarke’s debut solo release could well be the last of this short-lived typology to see the light of day: a collection of cooped-up, minimalist instrumentals produced at home – in this case on a modular synthesiser, with sparing touches of cello, soprano and folk balladry. Modular synths are a notorious time-sink for electronic tinkerers, so the empty days of lockdown were the perfect opportunity for Clarke – one of our great synthpop songwriters, via his work with to Depeche Mode, Yazoo and Erasure – to get stuck into the vast world of Eurorack YouTube tutorials.
