Epic Games has promised fixes to remedy early frustrations with Fortnite's newly introduced age ratings system, which has left players frustrated after many popular cosmetics have become unusable in certain parts of the game in order to meet ratings requirements.
</p><p>
Last month bought the news Epic would be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-mandating-individual-age-ratings-for-all-content-starting-in-november">introducing individual age ratings</a> for all playable first- and third-party content in Fortnite as part of what it called its evolution into a "multi-game ecosystem". Epic is, of course, currently trying to expand the reach of Fortnite by placing a greater focus on Roblox-style user-generated experiences build using its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unreal-editor-for-fortnite-launches-next-week

Seminal first-person shooter Half-Life turns 25 this weekend, and developer Valve is celebrating the occasion with a <a href="https://www.half-life.com/en/halflife25/">special anniversary update</a> adding new and restored content, alongside a bunch of other things. Oh, and it's made the game free to claim and keep starting today.
</p><p>
Half-Life, for those too young or too in denial to remember, introduced the world to crowbar-toting science nerd Gordon Freeman on 19th November 1998 (Freeman's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHxyZaZlaOs">full-life consequences</a> wouldn't materialise until sometime later), and anyone looking to relive their memories of those halcyon days now get to do so with some fancy extra bits thrown in.

Starting with the game itself, Half-Life has received a spot of gentle massagin

Developer Aspyr Media has claimed the free cut content DLC it planned to release for Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic 2 on Switch was cancelled after objections from a "third-party".
</p><p>
That's <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/11/16/star-wars-aspyr-kotor-2-lawsuit">according to Axios</a>, which reports Aspyr made the claim as part of an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fans-file-class-action-lawsuit-over-cancelled-kotor-2-dlc">ongoing lawsuit</a> relating to the DLC's failure to release, which was filed by a Malachi Mickelonis earlier this year. Mickelonis argues Aspyr and publisher Saber Interactive violated California consumer law by cancelling the DLC, and intentionally deceived purchasers "in order to artificially raise sales revenues...based on qualities and features that the game simply did not possess".

Square Enix has released a five minute recap video of Final Fantasy 7 Remake ahead of the release of Rebirth.
</p><p>
The video, narrated by flaming beast Red XIII, uses footage from the first game to detail the story so far. The video will also be viewable from the main menu of Rebirth, or you can watch it now in the embed below.
</p><p>
Last week <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-to-include-17-minute-cg-recap-of-remake-rumours-suggest">rumours suggested this sort of recap video would be included</a>. They were right, aside from it not being a 17 minute CG film.

Unity has announced the next version of its engine will launch in 2024 and expand on its "responsibly sourced" AI tools.
</p><p>
Unity 6, as announced at yesterday's Unite event, will feature performance improvements, accelerated multiplayer game development, and an expansion of the Muse suite of AI tools that's now in early access, reports <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/unitys-push-for-responsibly-sourced-ai-tools">GamesIndustry.biz</a>.

Marc Whitten, president and general manager of Unity Create (the team responsible for the engine), also stated the company is "doubling down on the areas that our creators care about the most, specifically the engine", following a fallout with developers over its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unity-announces-significant-changes-to-its-controversial-new-pricing-plan">controve

A PlayStation 5 version of The Last of Us Part 2 has reportedly been added to the console's database. 
</p><p>
As spotted by reputable social media account PlayStation Game Size, which is known for sourcing this type of information, a PS5 version of the PlayStation 4 exclusive has been added to the backend of the PlayStation Network. 
</p><p>
While The Last of Us Part 2 was enhanced for PlayStation 5 back in 2021, it was not a native port. Rumours continue to swirl that such an edition is - perhaps - on the cards.

Lords of the Fallen has received yet another major update, this time including a "complete overhaul to all bosses" as well as a new lock-on system.
</p><p>
The game's previous patch already made changes to increase the challenge of certain bosses. Now further tweaks have been made more broadly.
</p><p>
"It was clear (both from your feedback and our internal findings) that many bosses simply weren't posing enough of a challenge, so we have rebalanced some behaviours, as well as their hit points and damage output, to ensure they pose the correct level of difficulty at that point in your journey," read the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LordsoftheFallen/comments/17wymsr/update_v11326_build_notes/">patch notes on reddit</a> from Hexworks.

Not to brag, but last night I spent a fiver buying the film of A Month in the Country online. It's the film of J.L. Carr's miniature masterpiece of a novel about a veteran of the Great War who spends a month restoring a mural in an old church, and it stars cinema's most fragile hunk, Colin Firth. (Kenneth Branagh, singularly non-fragile as ever, is also in it, alongside Natasha Richardson.)
</p><p>
I'd wanted to see the film for a while, partly because I read the book last year, I think, and it absolutely floored me. It's tender and peaceful and exquisitely human, and it's a great way into the work of Carr himself, who seems wonderfully oddball in his work and interests. But I also wanted to see it because the film, which was made in 1987, was presumed to have been lost, until a copy of it turned up in a warehouse in the e

Embracer boss Lars Wingefors is staying tight-lipped on the current state of the Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic remake. 
</p><p>
During a recent earnings presentation for the Swedish conglomerate, Wingefors was asked how he was feeling about the Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic remake. As a reminder, this remake was first announced back in 2021.
</p><p>
However, rather than providing an update on its fate, the CEO simply stated: "I notice that anything I say to this becomes a headline, so that is my only comment."

How do you communicate what it's like to live in a body that's become hostile and cruel? It's a question that haunts the writing of a piece like this. In the imprecise language we possess to describe a spectrum of pain that is just as inexact, it's almost impossible to make people whose pain is only ever passing understand what it's like to live with a pain that is all-encompassing and never leaves.
</p><p>
"I think unless you've experienced it yourself," Kolo Jones, <a href="http://twitch.tv/helloitskolo">a content creator who works under the name helloitskolo</a>, says, "it's very hard to appreciate the isolation and exhaustion and boredom of being disabled."

As Kolo suggests, chronic pain is about more than pain. It exacts an existential toll as well as a physical one. It's from under this umbrella of chronic
