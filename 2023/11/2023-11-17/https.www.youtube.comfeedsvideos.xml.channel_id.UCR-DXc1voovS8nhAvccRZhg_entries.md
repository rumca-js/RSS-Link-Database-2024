The Pineberry Pi HatDrive! is a series of HATs that use the new PCIe connection on the Raspberry Pi 5.

How fast can we get our SSD to go? Can you overclock the Raspberry Pi's PCIe bus?

Special thanks to Pineberry Pi for sending these two evaluation boards (they did not pay any money nor had any say in the content of this video, but I still mark it 'sponsored' since they sent the equipment under test!). Find out more and pre-order one for your Pi at https://pineberrypi.com
