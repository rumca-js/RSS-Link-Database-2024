It was early in the fire season for the subarctic region and slabs of ice were still floating on its lakes. A water-bombing helicopter was immediately scrambled but it was already too late. Within two hours, flames had roared through 60 hectares (150 acres) of forest. By the end of the day, 90,000 people had been driven from their homes. Whole neighbourhoods had been reduced to ash.</p><p>A week later, recalls John Vaillant in Fire Weather, a gripping account that has just won the Baillie Gifford prize for nonfiction, the city looked as if it had suffered a nuclear blast.

Yet that match is the outlier. Because despite unrivalled success on the pitch in recent years in England, the club is still struggling to fill the main stadium when the women’s team play there. Chelsea built on the 24,564 that watched them play Spurs in 2019, but this year’s game against the same opponents attracted only 14,776. Why is this? Why are the winners of the past four league titles unable to regularly get closing to filling Stamford Bridge and what can they do to hit that target?</p><p>Let’s be clear, only one club, Arsenal, is getting this right at the moment and consistently attracting large crowds at its main stadium. Arsenal have also sold out only one game, their Champions League semi-final loss to Wolfsburg

<p>Titled Maman, the bronze, steel and marble arachnid will be the looming centrepiece of the Art Gallery of NSW’s major summer exhibition</p><p>Looming over the sandstone steps of the Art Gallery of New South Wales, a giant spider is redirecting foot traffic.</p><p>The giant spider, titled Maman, is one of the late French-American artist Louise Bourgeois’ most renowned – and most outsized – works, towering at almost 10m at its highest point and sprawling just as wide. When I visit on the final day of installation, it is cordoned off – though at regular intervals, visitors peer through the gaps to gawp at the spindly creation within. People take photos from various angles in an effort to bypass the fence; others, circumnavigating the sculpture, end up down back alleys trying to find their way back.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/nov/18/louise-bourgeois-giant-spider-maman-sydney-art-gallery-nsw-summer-exhibition">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Doctors have been warning of the health risks from sugar for almost 400 years. Here’s how we still ended up consuming so much of it</p><p>On my daily trundle down my local high street, I’ve been marking the changes as shopfitters swoop in with pink or white or glittery shop furniture. Almost every new shop in this corner of north London seems to be a teen- and family-friendly cafe selling bubble tea, sweet fluffy pancakes, ice-creams or desserts with names such as “choco coma”. Sugar is cheap, so the shopkeepers need to sell a lot of treats to make it pay. Fortunately for their business model, but unfortunately for the nation’s health, Britain consumes twice as much sugar as it should.</p><p>I tut inwardly at these signs of our sugar addiction as I enter Sainsbury’s to stock up on baking ingredients: icing sugar for coffee cake, muscovado and caster sugar for that amazing caramelised apple cake recipe I’ve found; golden syrup and treacle for winter-friendly gingerbread.</p> <a hre

<p>Mid-priced Australian shiraz can beat malbecs at around the same price for big, juicy flavours</p><p>If you’d asked me what my favourite red was back in the 1990s, when I first started writing about wine, it would probably have been an Australian shiraz. I just couldn’t get over how voluptuous these wines were – how ripe, how velvety, how silkily smooth. Tastes change, though, and as time went on I fell out of love with them – they seemed to become sweeter and jammier, or maybe I was just less tolerant of sweetness, plus they didn’t really fit in with much of the lighter, more plant-based food that I wanted to eat.</p><p>But the other week I found myself at a wine tasting, trying a run of mid-priced bottles, all around the £10 mark, and thinking what good quality and how reasonably priced the shirazes were. Not only that, but, quality-wise, they outstripped most malbecs at the same price point.</p><p>For more by Fiona Beckett, go to <a href="https://fionabeckett.substack.com/">fio

<p>The Saturday Night Live trio’s first feature comedy is a mediocre, misfiring sketch that’s 90 minutes too long</p><p>Like The Lonely Island and Pete Davidson before them, Please Don’t Destroy, the trio of NYU-bred comedians known for their Saturday Night Live digital shorts, are spinning off from the variety show into their own feature film. It’s a trend of diminishing returns. Please Don’t Destroy: The Treasure of Foggy Mountain, their feature comedy debut, was originally slated to premiere in theaters before it got dumped on Peacock, and for good reason. I imagine most people involved don’t want viewers to notice. As comedy writers and movie actors, the members of Please Don’t Destroy – Martin Herlihy, John Higgins and Ben Marshall – are out of their depth.</p><p>That’s not a knock on their brand of comedy, which works in small doses. I’ve been a fan of some of their sketches, particularly their pre-SNL videos posted on Twitter during the long, bizarre malaise that was being onl

The most eye-catching appointment in Rishi Sunak’s reshuffle was the improbable return of David Cameron.

In which case he allowed Suella Braverman to continue stoking division and hatred before last Saturday’s pro-Palestinian march. Not something I would want to boast about. But the resurrection of Big Dave was certainly a surprise. Not least because it rather implied that Sunak had searched through his database of 350 Conservative MPs and not found one capable of being foreign secretary. Cameron is having to be speedily elevated to the Lords to accommodate him in the cabinet.

But now restaurants were empty and people longed for foods they once relished. I missed drinking wine in a bar, watching others enjoying their evenings. I wondered how I could contribute during these trying times.

<p>The Chocolat author on the magic of Ray Bradbury, re-reading Gormenghast, and the poetry of Wuthering Heights</p><p><strong>My earliest reading memory</strong><br />I was about five, sitting in my grandfather’s study in Brittany, listening to him reading to me in French from his translated copy of Rudyard Kipling’s The Jungle Book. He read me those stories so often that when he tried to skip a section, or rephrase something he thought was clumsy, I would correct him word-for-word. His nickname for me was <em>Grenouille</em> (frog), which also happened to be what Mowgli, the young protagonist’s, name meant, and I was convinced the stories were about me.</p><p><strong>My favourite book growing up</strong><br />Ray Bradbury’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2012/dec/14/ray-bradbury-something-wicked-this-way-comes" title="">Something Wicked This Way Comes</a>.

Allow me to introduce the showstopper of the season, the sweetheart neckline. The cutesy name is misleading, because this is one fierce look. A dress that turns heads so fast it can cause whiplash. Strapless and curvy with a deep plunge, the sweetheart neckline made a red-carpet comeback this year – a floor-length Saint Laurent black velvet number made no fewer than three appearances in the space of a few days at the Venice film festival in August – and is primed to race into pole position when party season hots up.<br /><br />But … there’s a but. I wouldn’t quibble with this dress to its face, because a person who wears this dress would think nothing of emptying a drink over you should you step out of line. But, is the sweetheart neckline not a bit retro? A bit 1983 Fulham cocktail party? Are we getting hints of Poison by Dior and

Everyone is happy, it seems.</p><p>But my issue with beauty Advent calendars is similar to my rejection of most beauty subscription boxes: I don’t want

<p>The Bluey TV show has blossomed into a cultural phenomenon, not least because of its frank, empathic take on parenting. But how to replicate that in a children’s video game?</p><p>Following Peppa Pig’s capable reign as the most bearable option for overwhelmed parents looking for respite from the gaudy assault that is preschooler TV, a family of Australian dogs has set a new standard for what kids’ shows can offer grownups. That family are the Heelers, stars of the tremendously popular children’s animated sitcom Bluey – at one point Australia’s most watched television programme, and more popular than Succession in the US.<br /><br />Sharp, funny, beautiful and poignant, Bluey is focused on the misadventures inherent in life aged six and under; but also, it frankly reflects the parenting experience. For half its audience, its most touching moments are those where canine mum and dad, Chilli and Bandit, juggle the stress and pride of watching their offspring learn a life lesson, or jo

<p>A series of delicious case studies trace fault lines of class, cost and convenience that run through the story of British food</p><p>Pen Vogler explains that her new book “is about how society in the British Isles has arranged itself around … two versions of ‘stuffed’”. On the one hand, there is that post-dinner feeling of being pleasantly replete with delicious, wholesome food. But then there’s also “stuffed” in the sense of being trapped in an impossible situation with no safe way out. This is the experience of the millions of Britons currently living with chronic food insecurity, obliged to fill up on cheap meals to satisfy immediate hunger pangs while skimping on the nutrients that every body needs.</p><p>It is the lack of common ground between these two types of stuffedness, the privileged and the deprived, that troubles Vogler.

The left has struggled with that question for decades, but the conflict between Israel and Hamas renders it painfully acute. If Labour isn’t for a ceasefire, an end to the bloodshed, then what <em>is</em> it for? Is it in favour of premature babies dying because hospitals can’t keep their incubators running, of refugee camps being bombed, of once-teeming neighbourhoods being reduced to wastelands?</p><p>Put like that, the answer may seem obvious, and in emails to many of the 56 <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/nov/15/commons-gaza-vote-labour-defy-starmer-ceasefire-israel">Labour MPs who rebelled</a> against the whip on Wednesday night to call for a ceasefire, it will have been put in much more emotive terms.

<p>It was once a stately piece of landmark TV, but seven years on it’s a trashy, unwittingly comical melodrama that borders on the exploitative. How did things get so bad?</p><p>Prime ministers have called it “malicious nonsense” and “complete rubbish”. Theatrical dames have criticised it as “crude sensationalism”. And now the notices for the new season are in, they don’t make pretty reading, either.

Other critics have called it “clumsy and crass”, “ill-judged and outrageous”, “pointless and sad”, “a disappointing new low”, “a very pretty bore”.

<p>The Neretva, in Bosnia and Herzegovina, is one of the most biodiverse rivers on the continent – supporting bears, wolves, lynx and many rare species – but more than 50 planned dams could permanently transform the ecosystem</p><p>At the bottom of a ravine, near the mountain town of Ulog, in Bosnia and Herzegovina, lie the sparkling turquoise waters of the Ljuta, a tributary of the Neretva. In its upper stretches, the Neretva is one of Europe’s most unspoiled rivers, and it appears to be a scene of pristine wilderness.</p><p>But lethal landmines left behind from the country’s two-decades-old conflict litter its forested slopes, and wild dogs roam the trails.
