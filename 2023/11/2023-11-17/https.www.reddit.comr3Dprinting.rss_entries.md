<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I'm looking for a new 3D printer for the company I work for and have been doing a lot of printer comparisons. I'll find two printers with almost identical specs (same build volume, nozzle/bed temps, filament compatibilities, etc), but one is ~$10,000 and the other is ~$1000.</p> <p>What are the additional features you get for the price? Is it just higher reliability and repeatability along with tech support from the company? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Fallen_Goose_"> /u/Fallen_Goose_ </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/17x20cx/what_separates_an_industrial_3d_printer_from_a/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/17x20cx/what_separates_an_industrial_3d_printer_from_a/">[comments]</a></span>
