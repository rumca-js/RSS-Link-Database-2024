Many people believe that if Vanke goes bust, it\u2019ll be the end of real estate in China. For this reason, scandals about Vanke are shielded by the government.\nNow, in Xi'an, the capital city of Shaanxi Province, homeowners, out of their own safety, have posted videos and photos online to appeal to the public and beg for help. They are facing great difficulties in defending their rights because the building they bought from Vanke is horribly tilted, and they are fighting against Vanke. \n\nHave questions?
