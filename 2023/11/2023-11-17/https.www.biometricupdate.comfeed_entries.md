		Baltimore City Council has proposed legislation that would require businesses employing facial recognition software to register with a city and post a sign saying "facial recognition technology in use" to notify patrons, according to <a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/maryland/baltimore-city/bs-md-ci-facial-recognition-transparency-standards-baltimore-20231116-nl2alwfx3fhz7dvpfui26xn6dm-story.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Baltimore Sun</a>.

The sign would let patrons know that entering an establishment is the same as “consenting to your physical appearance being collected, generated or analyzed.” This follows as a <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202305/us-city-ends-facial-recognition-moratorium-considers-new-rules-for-police">moratorium on facial recognit

		Ordinary Australians still lack an understanding of the concept behind the country’s upcoming digital ID system, research commissioned by the government has shown.

The research, which was conducted by financial comparison site Canstar, also showed that Australians are in favor of having more control over personal data and how it is shared, trade publication InnovationAus <a href="https://www.innovationaus.com/digital-ids-biggest-challenge-may-be-explaining-how-it-works/">reports</a>.

There is interest in the digital ID because people have understood that it could help them secure their information, Finance Deputy Secretary Nathan Williamson said in October.

		Brexit has caused a drop in inbound travel, prompting segments of that industry to pressure UK officials to ease up. The best that London can offer right now, however, is a temporary patch and a confusing knot of new and old travel regulations.

Children visiting the UK from France as part of class trips can now legally enter using just <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202103/frances-new-biometric-id-cards-from-in-groupe-actually-fit-in-peoples-wallets-enable-eu-travel">national IDs</a> with biometric images.

		Biometrics, automation, and drones are a part of the United Kingdom's new plan to transform policing.

Gavin Stephens, chair of the National Police Chiefs’ Council (<a href="https://www.npcc.police.uk/">NPCC</a>) laid out a new direction for the police force on Wednesday citing several key areas for improvement. Aside from increasing effectiveness, training and financial resilience, the plan includes ramping up innovation, according to an announcement from the NPCC.

Stephens said there were four technological projects underway to improve policing. The first one is a new digital fingerprint-matching system that will speed up the process by three days on average and increase fingerprint hits by 50 percent by fiscal year 2025 and 2026.

The police also plan to take advanta

		A lobbying group widely considered a so-called Astroturf organization has posted its argument for ending the U.S. state of Illinois' Biometric Information Privacy Act's threat to businesses.

Lawsuits alleging BIPA violations by businesses are harming companies more than they are helping consumers, it says.

The group is called Citizens Against Lawsuit Abuse and it has offices across the nation challenging judicial review of a given issue. Despite the name, it is a business advocacy group that was first started to prevent suits against the tobacco industry.
