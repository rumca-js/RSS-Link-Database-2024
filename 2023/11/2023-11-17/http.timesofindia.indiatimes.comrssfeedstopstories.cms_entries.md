Hezbollah, the Lebanese militant group, is reluctant to be drawn into a full-blown war with Israel due to the potential losses it could incur. Iran, Hezbollah's patron, also shares this reluctance, as both groups are important for Iran's geopolitical goals. Hezbollah is stronger and has more firepower than Hamas, with an estimated 100,000 fighters and a missile stockpile of 130,000 to 150,000. The clashes between Hezbollah and the Israeli military have so far remained within their rules of engagement, but there is a risk that this restraint may not last.

The possibility of India winning the cricket World Cup has raised concerns over increased pollution in Delhi due to firecracker celebrations. This could lead to the extension of GRAP IV restrictions in the capital. A special task force has been formed to enforce GRAP rules, and fines have been imposed on vehicles and construction sites that violate pollution norms. Environmental experts predict that the air quality index will remain in the very poor category for the next few days.
