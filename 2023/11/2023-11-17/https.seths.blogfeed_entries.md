For years, I&#8217;ve been using this picture of Neil Armstrong when I tell the story of meeting him and hearing his talk at one of his last public appearances: I wasn&#8217;t there when this photo was taken, so I relied on a Google image search to find it: I compounded Google&#8217;s error. Sorry, Buzz. Neil [&#8230;]
