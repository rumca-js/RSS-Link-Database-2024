<p>Apple has joined Meta and TikTok owner ByteDance in contesting their platforms’ definitions as part of the EU’s Digital Markets Act (DMA). The legislation allows regulators to designate dominant companies’ services or platforms as “gatekeepers,” or big and powerful enough to act as a bottleneck between businesses and customers, which it can then fine for prohibited behavior. It currently targets 22 gatekeeper services run by six Big Tech companies (Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet’s Google, Meta, Amazon and ByteDance’s TikTok). The law <a href="https://www.engadget.com/european-union-digital-markets-services-acts-131818075.html">encourages consumer-friendly competition</a>, preventing businesses from imposing unfair conditions on customers.</p>

<p>Rivian is sweetening the pot just ahead of the Tesla Cybertruck launch by <a href="https://twitter.com/Rivian/status/1725284158459756792?s=20"><ins>offering a free wall charger</ins></a> and a $2,000 installation credit when you buy an electric pickup. This deal’s <a href="https://rivian.com/support/article/how-do-i-know-if-i-m-eligible-for-the-r1t-home-charging-bundle"><ins>only for the R1T truck</ins></a> and doesn’t apply to the company’s R1S SUV. The Home Charging Bundle, as it's called, will be in effect until the end of the year.</p>
<p>Here’s how it works. The wall charger ships a few days after ordering the truck, saving you around $800, and the purchase automatically provides a credit with Rivian’s installation partner Qmerit. Just contact Qmerit to set up an installation and it should be smooth sailing from there. According to the installation company, <a href="https://qmerit.com/ev-charging-faq/"><ins>these installation projects typically cost</ins></a> $800 to $2,000,

<p>Discord is pulling the plug on its AI chatbot, Clyde, less than a year after it was first introduced. Clyde’s <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/13066317497239-Clyde-Discord-s-AI-Chatbot"><ins>support page</ins></a> has been updated with a note alerting users that the bot will be deactivated at the end of this month.

It’s powered by OpenAI technology.</p>
<p>“By December 1, 2023, users will no longer be able to invoke Clyde in DMs, Group DMs or server chats,” according to the note. Clyde was intended to act as an AI helper that could be accessed right within the server. Users could also converse with it for fun, and ask it to play games or spit jokes. It didn’t seem to roll out universally,

## Engadget Podcast: Why the PlayStation Portal is truly baffling

<p>Sony’s next “PSP,” the PlayStation Portal, is one odd little device. It can only stream games from your PlayStation 5 – beyond that, it’s a $200 doorstop. In this episode, Cherlynn and Devindra chat with CNET’s Scott Stein about the Portal and the many ways it baffles us. While it does manage to stream games from the PS5 just fine, it’s also expensive, clunky and lacks basic features like Bluetooth audio support. It’s really only meant for the most diehard PS5 owners (and even they should probably wait for a sale).</p>

<p>Apple has announced it will <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-will-start-supporting-rcs-in-2024-182232923.html"><ins>begin supporting the RCS messaging standard at some point next year</ins></a>. RCS, or Rich Communication Services, was developed by the mobile industry as an upgrade on SMS and MMS. But Apple has been resistant to adopt it both because it prefers its home-grown iMessage platform, and because it’s not secure by default. It doesn’t help that Google has used RCS as a cudgel in its own text-message–bubble-color culture war with the iPhone maker.</p>
<p>In a statement, presumably typed through gritted teeth, Apple said RCS would offer better interoperability compared to SMS and MMS. But added that iMessage, which, unlike RCS, is end-to-end encrypted by default, remains the “best and most secure messaging experience.” It’s likely the change was, in part, motivated by the European Union, which has been turning its attention to the ways the technology industry makes

<p>In May 2022, just months before Elon Musk acquired Twitter (now X), the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) hit the platform with a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ftc-twitter-targeted-advertising-215320214.html">$150 million fine</a> and consent decree that imposed stipulations for safeguarding users' personal data. The ruling was imposed after the FTC found that Twitter had violated a <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2011/03/ftc-accepts-final-settlement-twitter-failure-safeguard-personal-information-0">previous consent decree</a> by inappropriately sharing user phone numbers and email addresses with advertisers.</p>
<p>After acquiring Twitter, Elon Musk went to court in an attempt to overturn that consent decree, arguing that the FTC had increased scrutiny on X and pressured a third-party assessor to find fault with its security practices. In a post on X at the time, Musk called the FTC's actions &quot;a shameful case of weaponization of a government age

<p>Qualcomm just unveiled the latest mobile chipset to join its armada, the Snapdragon 7 Gen 3.
