Image and Form Games' SteamWorld series is best known for its sci-fi settings with lovable robots and for branching out into different genres. Its latest title, SteamWorld Build, is developed by The Station and delves into city-building with a dash of Dungeon Keeper.

It's a unique yet robust strategy experiment, as players expand their towns, cater to the needs of its citizens and delve further into the mines to search for Old Tech. Despite switching between multiple screens, the experience is paced well, with charming characters and excellent presentation.

Some things could be better, like item pricing and the lack of hotkeys for quickly accessing certain functions. However, SteamWorld Build is still a compelling experience, mixing familiar genres for a fun gameplay loop while retaining the series' quirky atmosphere.
