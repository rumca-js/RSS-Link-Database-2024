The commission opened an investigation in July and plans to make a final decision in February. Amazon said it is working with EU regulators to address their concerns. &#8220;iRobot, which faces intense competition from other vacuum cleaner suppliers, offers practical and inventive products,&#8221; an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement. &#8220;We believe&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2023/eu-regulators-say-amazons-irobot-deal-could-restric", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2023/eu-regulators-say-amazons-irobot-deal-could-restrict-competiton", "date_published": "2023-11-27T20:23:46+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "GeekWire", "album": "GeekWire", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://www.geekwire.com/wp-content/themes/geekwire/dist/images/geekwire-logo-rss.png", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed/", "title": "Cyber Monday expected to be biggest U.S. online shopping day of all time at $12B in spend", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"667\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/amznboxes.jpeg\" width=\"1000\" /><br />U.S. consumers are expected to spend between $12-to-$12.4 billion on Cyber Monday, which would exceed forecasts and set a new record, according to Adobe Analytics.", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2023/cyber-monday-expected-to-be-biggest-u-s-online-shopping-day-of-all-time-at-12b-in-spend", "date_published": "2023-11-27T16:54:18+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "GeekWire", "album": "GeekWire", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://www.geekwire.com/wp-content/themes/geekwire/dist/images/geekwire-logo-rss.png", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed/", "title": "Inside the AI chip race: How a pivotal happy hour changed Amazon\u2019s strategy in the cloud", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"944\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/james-hamilton-nafea-new-1260x944.jpg\" width=\"1260\" /><br />Annapurna Labs co-founder Nafea Bshara knows semiconductors and appreciates a good red wine.

That&#8217;s how they ended up at the historic Virginia Inn restaurant and bar at Seattle&#8217;s Pike Place Market 10 years ago, in the fall of 2013, engaged in a conversation that would ultimately change the course of Amazon&#8217;s cloud business. Their meeting, and Amazon&#8217;s eventual acquisition of Annapurna, accelerated the tech giant&#8217;s then-fledgling initiative to create its own processors, laying the foundation for a key component of its current artificial&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2023/inside-the-ai-chip-race-how-a-pivotal-happy-hour-changed-am", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2023/inside-the-ai-chip-race-how-a-pivotal-happy-hour-changed-amazons-strategy-in-the-cloud", "date_published": "2023-11-27T14:22:21+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "GeekWire", "album": "GeekWire", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://www.geekwire.com/wp-content/themes/geekwire/dist/images/geekwire-logo-rss.png", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed/", "title": "Amazon puts Fire TV Cube to work: AWS repurposes streaming device for desktop computing", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"776\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Amazon-WorkSpaces-Thin-Client-Image-cropped-1260x776.jpg\" width=\"1260\" /><br />At a company famous for turning doors into desks, it only made sense for Amazon&#8217;s cloud division to find its first desktop productivity device in one of its consumer division&#8217;s existing streaming media products. Amazon WorkSpaces, the company&#8217;s virtual desktop service, just unveiled its first device for end users, a $195 product created by directly repurposing the hardware design for Amazon&#8217;s Fire TV Cube. Amazon Web Services says it decided to take the approach after hearing from its enterprise customers that they wanted a low-priced device. &#8220;We said, &#8216;Hey, we would love to not have to manufacture a new device,&#8217;&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2023/amazon-puts-fire-tv-cube-to-work-aws-repurposes-streaming-device-for-desktop-comput", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2023/amazon-puts-fire-tv-cube-to-work-aws-repurposes-streaming-device-for-desktop-computing", "date_published": "2023-11-27T01:00:00+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "GeekWire", "album": "GeekWire", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://www.geekwire.com/wp-content/themes/geekwire/dist/images/geekwire-logo-rss.png", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}]
