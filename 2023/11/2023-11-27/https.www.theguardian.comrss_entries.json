Everton are founder members of the Premier League. Everton broke Premier League rules. Everton admitted breaking Premier League rules. Everton were punished for breaking Premier League rules. So while Everton and their fans have every right to feel aggrieved by what they see as an excessively punitive sanction, it seems a bit odd that they have decided the body that handed it down is \u201ccorrupt\u201d. If anything, it could be argued that the decision to slap one of their most established members with a 10-point deduction is evidence that the Premier League is demonstrably even-handed and fair.
