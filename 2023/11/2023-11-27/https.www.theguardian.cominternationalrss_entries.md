<p>Activists including Cynthia Nixon say they are launching five-day fast ‘to showcase the actions of President Biden’ </p><p>Leftwing activists including the actor Cynthia Nixon, famous for her role in Sex and the City, have begun a hunger strike outside the White House aimed at pressing Joe Biden into demanding a permanent ceasefire in Gaza.</p><p>The five-day fast was launched to coincide with what had been the scheduled end of a four-day truce in Israel’s military offensive into the Palestinian coastal territory, during which the Palestinian group Hamas released dozens of hostages. Israel has also released several batches of Palestinian prisoners, most of them women and minors. The truce was later extended by a further two days following mediation from Egypt and Qatar.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/nov/27/white-house-hunger-strike-gaza-cynthia-nixon">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Eric Roy lost his most important player in the summer and had little money to sign a replacement, but Brest are flying high</p><p>By <a href="https://twitter.com/_adam_white_?lang=en">Adam White</a> for <a href="http://www.getfootballnewsfrance.com/">Get French Football News</a></p><p>Having spent the last few years dodging relegation, it looked as if Brest might finally go down this season. As a small club in a congested area of north-west France, they trail Rennes, Nantes and even Lorient, Angers and Guingamp at times in the fight for fans and attention. Restricted by a small catchment area and resources, drifting between Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 has become the norm.</p><p>So, when Ligue 1 was reduced to 18 clubs before this season, they looked in more danger than most. In their latest stint in the top flight, they have finished 14th, 17th, 11th and 14th. There have been some highlights since their promotion in 2019, but those finishes largely flatter the club.</p> <a href="https://w

It was the 1970s. “In those days historical fiction wasn’t respectable or respected,” she recalled. “It meant historical romance. If you read a brilliant novel like I, Claudius, you didn’t taint it with the genre label, you just thought of it as literature. So, I was shy about naming what I was doing. All the same, I began. I wanted to find a novel I liked, about the French Revolution. I couldn’t, so I started making one.”</p><p>She made A Place of Greater Safety, an exceptional ensemble portrayal of the revolutionaries Danton, Robespierre an

Readers share their best memories from 60 years of travelling in the Tardis</p><p>We were living in France when Doctor Who was resurrected with Christopher Eccleston, so we missed it. I wasn’t too bothered, since I was a huge Tom Baker fan and very defensive of my childhood programme. We moved back to the UK when our kids were six and three. My husband and I ended up watching it when they were in bed. A woman was roaming around a deserted house. She peeled back the wallpaper find a message – addressed to her. Then the statues in the garden started getting closer. It was the weeping angel episode. David Tennant played the Doctor then, but at this point we didn’t even realise it was a Doctor Who episode. We were shocked – that’s way too scary for kids! Of course, we forget just how scary it was back in the 70s and 80s, with huge spiders crawling over people and monsters walking out

His stall, Box No 50, occupies a great position in the sociable middle of the market, right next to the sunken excavations of an ancient road, and opposite the bar. Like all the stalls on the new market, it is a white box that is open on two sides: the longer, slanted counter is divided into sections for vegetables, and the shorter one is full of fruit. Much of the produce is <em>produzione proprio</em>, or their own produce. Either from Casaletto, a green belt of the city just a few kilometres away, or cultivated on land that Marco’s family rents in Maccarese on the coast. While he is often around on a Saturday (unloading or sitting on the bench trimming vegetables), Marco’s father Mattia has recently stepped back from the stall, leaving the day-to-day running to his son.

You find yourself searching for the psychological scars written in their tired, thinner faces. In some of the “after” shots, it’s as if war has completely rewired them. Their features look subtly but noticeably different, muscles in their faces clenched, hardening their expressions – or somehow making them softer.

<p>The quarterback’s only positive contribution to his team this season may be to provide a long-term successor</p><p>Mac Jones and the New England Patriots have had a classic relationship arc. When Bill Belichick broke his historic bond with Tom Brady after the 2019 season, he was adrift. He had unproductive flings with Cam Newton and Jarrett Stidham in 2020’s pandemic-disrupted season. But in 2021, Belichick decided to settle down again; he drafted Jones, who had just led Alabama to a national championship, with the 15th pick. Belichick and Jones’ first year together was a vision; Jones wasn’t a <em>star</em>, but he was the most productive rookie quarterback in a class that included Trevor Lawrence, Justin Fields, Trey Lance (yikes) and Zach Wilson (doubles yikes). The Patriots made it to the playoffs, and though Jones had some limitations, he looked like Belichick’s partner for the long haul.</p><p>The situation gradually disintegrated in 2022 as Jones failed to progress, and it

Beyond their 10-point penalty, Goodison Park rattled with the sound of further injustice, with just about every refereeing decision barracked. It is not uncommon for fans to believe referees are biased against their club, such complaints are heard at every ground in the world but John Brooks actually ruled – and wrongly, as shown by VAR – in Everton’s favour when booking Anthony Martial for a dive when Ashley Young had committed an injudicious foul. A siege mentality is fair enough considering circumstances and during the first half there were signs it was an effective motivation tool. But becoming distracted by the perceived injustice of Brooks’s decisions only served to drop heads.

The relative was Hannah Masury, wife of the ship’s captain, Edward Howe. Unusually for the time, Hannah joined Edward on his voyages, helping to transport locomotives and labourers to and from California. One day, while sailing around the Pacific coast, Edward died. Without a commander, the crew and passengers attempted a mutiny, but Hannah had other ideas.</p><p>“She took control of the ship with just a pistol and hung a flag up to signal their distress,” says Howe, speaking via Zoom from her home in M

<p>When his vision failed, Roger Cowell knew he needed to find a different way to live. So he put pen to paper, and the words poured out of him<br /></p><p>In 2019, Roger Cowell realised he was losing his vision. “When I was on holiday in Japan, one day I woke up and everyone’s faces had no features,” he says. “It was terrifying. As my sight deteriorated, it was like I was sitting in a dark room waiting for someone to turn the lights back on.”</p><p>He returned to the home he shares with his wife, Heather, in West Yorkshire and underwent tests to diagnose a genetic condition that was causing his central vision to disappear. By February 2020, he could only see through his peripheral vision and had to rely on help. “I was fiercely independent and I had to try to accept this new world,” he says. “I needed to find a different way to live.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/nov/27/a-new-start-after-60-i-lost-my-sight-fell-in-a-canal-and-became-the-writer-id-always

In recent weeks, heads of state from Germany and Great Britain have addressed the colonial crimes committed in Tanzania and Kenya respectively.

<p>The author’s account of his youth amid Kenya’s 1950s anti-colonial uprising is an unforgettable mix of history and memoir</p><p>“We only went to Kenya because a Nairobi businessman fumbled in his jacket pocket.” So begins Nicholas Rankin’s hybrid of history and memoir focused on the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/mau-mau">Mau Mau</a> uprising in the 1950s. The businessman’s car keys “snagged the trigger of his Beretta, and he shot himself in the stomach. My father got his job.”</p><p>Historians don’t write history, they curate it, and in <em>Trapped in History</em> Rankin challenges his own childhood absorption of propagandistic accounts of Britain’s imperial past. Nearly 70 years after his arrival in Kenya from Sheffield as an intensely curious boy, Rankin, a former BBC World Service producer, writer and consummate storyteller with a flair for drama, has composed an insightful tale of hubris in colonial east Africa, underpinned by rigorous research.</p> <a href="https
