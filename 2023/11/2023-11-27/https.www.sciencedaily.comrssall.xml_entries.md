Hair products often contain ingredients that easily evaporate, so users may inhale some of these chemicals, potentially posing health repercussions. Now, researchers have studied emissions of these volatile organic compounds (VOCs), including siloxanes, which shine and smooth hair. The scientists report that using these hair care products can change indoor air composition quickly, and common heat styling techniques -- straightening and curling -- increase VOC levels even more.

Wondering whether whether Dark Matter particles actually are produced inside a jet of standard model particles, led researchers to explore a new detector signature known as semi-visible jets, which scientists never looked at before.

## Scientists devise new technique that can pinpoint the causes and treatments of autoimmune diseases

An international team of researchers has developed a method that combines advanced high-throughput microfluidics and gene editing technology to source new treatments that could potentially help people with autoimmune conditions and cancer. In validating the new technique, they discovered a molecule they believe could inhibit interferon gamma production in the gut which -- if proven in clinical trials -- could represent an ideal means to control inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

Cell and gene therapies hold promise for treating various diseases, but technology to deliver targeted medicines to specific cells is lacking. Engineered cells produce multifunctional particles, designed to carry cargo and target specific cell types. In experiments, the particles successfully delivered gene editing cargo to T cells.

## Stem cell-based treatment controls blood sugar in people with Type 1 diabetes

An innovative stem cell-based treatment for Type 1 diabetes can meaningfully regulate blood glucose levels and reduce dependence on daily insulin injections, according to new clinical trial results. The therapy aims to replace the insulin-producing beta cells that people with Type 1 diabetes lack. Dubbed VC-02, the small medical implant contains millions of lab-grown pancreatic islet cells, including beta cells, that originate from a line of pluripotent stem cells.
