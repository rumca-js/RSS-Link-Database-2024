Yashasvi Jaiswal, a 21-year-old Indian cricketer, resembles Virender Sehwag's batting style, which includes a simple mantra of "see the ball, hit the ball."

In the second T20I against Australia, Jaiswal initially aimed to find boundaries but was forced to settle for singles due to the sluggish pitch.

CM Nitish Kumar plans to visit every home in Bihar to determine the stance on the liquor ban. He wants to ensure that the survey covers all areas and is not limited. Nitish attempted to make prohibition a poll issue in UP and Jharkhand but did not receive support from his allies. He stated that only the affluent who enjoy drinking are against him. Former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi criticized prohibition, particularly its impact on Dalits. BJP also wants a review of the liquor law, claiming it has failed. The government is prepared to fund another study to gauge public opinion on the ban.
