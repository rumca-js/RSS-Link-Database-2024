		Aussie banks are banding together to put fraud in a headlock with the Scam Safe Accord, a “new offensive in the war on scams” that will introduce obligatory biometric checks for the opening of new accounts, says a release from the Australian Banking Association (ABA) and the Customer Owned Banking Association (COBA), which strikes a decidedly triumphant tone.

“The initiatives we launch today are a significant step forward and demonstrate the banking industry’s commitment to fight scams,” says Mike Lawrence, CEO of the Customer Owned COBA. “Preventing scammers from taking the hard-earned money of <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202311/australians-do-not-understand-incoming-digital-id-system">everyday Australians</a> is a shared responsibility.

		Digital identity, cybersecurity and artificial intelligence are among the key areas covered by the new EU-Canada Digital Partnership, launched at the 19th <a href="https://www.eeas.europa.eu/canada/european-union-and-canada_en?s=220">EU-Canada</a> summit in St. John’s, Newfoundland last week.

A release from the European Commission says that the partnership is intended to strengthen the two regions’ ties as strategic and like-minded partners in the digital field. It supports a number of objectives, including cooperation on international connectivity and robust semiconductor supply chains, monitoring of the development and deployment of AI systems including <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202311/generative-ai-introduces-threats-potential-benefits-for-af

		A wrongful termination lawsuit against Idemia has been dismissed. A former executive had accused the U.S. subsidiary of the France-based ID services firm of discharging him when it learned of his cancer diagnosis.

Charles Carroll sued <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/idemia-identity-security-north-america">Idemia</a> Identity and Security in U.S. district court in 2021.

		The politics of police facial recognition systems are changing in favor of deployment in Ireland after last week's riot in Dublin.

Proposals to arm law enforcement with live, retrospective or both facial biometrics capabilities have been <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202306/us-state-ireland-curb-police-use-of-facial-recognition">controversial</a>. But biometrics in the hands of the police could be evolving into a law-and-order issue that's too politically popular to seriously question.

According to local reports, social media has been used to foment violence against immigrants to Ireland, resulting in street fighting that culminated in three children being stabbed and 34 arrests. Not incidentally, there are <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/ireland/20

		Colombia has launched the second version of its biometrically secured digital identity, adding new digital services for its citizens.

To complete the task, the National Civil Registry of Colombia (RNEC) hired 3,000 additional workers that digitized 74 million civil records, the agency <a href="https://twitter.com/Registraduria/status/1728189888980193326?s=20">says</a> in an announcement.

“Colombians, be proud,” writes Registrar General Alexander Vega Rocha. “The digital folder will host other documents. The new digital services transform our society and improve the quality of life of Colombians because it saves time and money.”

The updated digital ID, available as a mobile app, has four new tools. This includes identification, performing virtual transactions usin
