Galatasaray created an unwelcome hell that Cerberus would have been proud of and a night of sin ended with Alex Ferguson’s side being dumped out of Europe.</p><p>United, realistically, required a win to progress after drawing 3‑3 in the first leg of the second‑round tie at Old Trafford but the atmosphere in Turkey subdued the visitors and the second leg stuttered to a goalless draw. Eric Cantona was sent off late on for his frustrations with the referee and the home team’s addiction to timewasting. There was a post-match melee in the tunnel involving the United squad and riot police as the trip ended like it began – with intimidation. Many

## Willian’s pair of penalties help Fulham to dramatic late win against Wolves

<p>Fulham secured their first win in five matches after Willian scored his second penalty of the night deep into added time. It was awarded when the VAR, Stuart Attwell, told Michael Salisbury to look at the pitchside monitor after João Gomes caught Harry Wilson in the area. Contact seemed slight but it was enough and it was not long before Marco Silva was celebrating a win that moved his side away from the bottom three.</p><p>The hosts had made heavy weather of it. As their problems in front of goal faded, so did their ability to defend. Wolves showed character to respond to an early strike from Alex Iwobi and a penalty from Willian in the second half. There were goals from Matheus Cunha and the outstanding Hwang Hee-chan but Gary O’Neil’s side finished empty-handed.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/nov/27/fulham-wolves-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The plot of this trouble-in-suburbia thriller might be flimsy – but who cares when there’s so much sexual tension between our flirtatious foursome?</p><p>There are two extraordinary features to note about Channel 4’s new six-part drama series The Couple Next Door, which examines the combustible effects of a hot, swinging couple on a pair of conservative young things who move in next door. The first is that it succeeds in being sexy rather than cringemaking. This is vanishingly rare and comes courtesy of a clever, layered script that ties each of the narrative strands together perfectly and takes enough time to build every relationship within the foursome to allow what unfolds to feel plausible. Writer David Allison understands that even people destined to climb into bed with each other are capable of thinking and talking about other things while lust brews in the background, and cracking a few jokes along the way. I don’t know if this was present in the Dutch series New Neighbours

It has been a dramatic few years since he started writing the novel in 2018: his son had just been born; he had long Covid, which made writing an impossibility some days; he has had cancer and separated from his wife. And now he has landed the biggest prize in contemporary fiction. “There’s a general sense of unreality,” he says of winning. “I’ve stepped into my own ‘Sliding Doors’ counterfactual narrative.”</p><p>Before beginning the novel, Lynch had spent months writing “the wrong book”.

Sign up now!</a></p><p>While the preparation and energy Everton fans put into protesting against perceived Premier League corruption over the weekend was commendable, some folk are finding it difficult to understand what it is exactly they are so unhappy about. Everton are founder members of the Premier League. Everton broke Premier League rules. Everton admitted breaking Premier League rules. Everton were punished for breaking Premier League rules. So while Everton and their fans have every right to feel aggrieved by what they see as an excessively punitive sanction, it seems a bit odd that they have decided the body that handed it down is “corrupt”. If anything, it could be argued that the decision to slap one of their most established members with a 10-point deduction is evidence that the Premier League is demonstrably even-handed and fair.

<p>Congress returns from holiday break to hefty legislative agenda; expulsion vote for New York Republican representative George Santos expected this week</p><p>Good morning, US politics blog readers. Washington DC is shaking off the turkey-induced haze it lapsed into over the Thanksgiving holiday last week, and Congress has reconvened with a heaping plate of legislative matters to deal with. Many of these are dull, important, and familiar, such as the ongoing debate over funding the government, or <strong>Joe Biden</strong>’s request for $106b in aid to Ukraine, Israel and to fortify the southern border, but there’s one issue that is expected to be dealt with soon and will be truly noteworthy if it happens: expelling <strong>George Santos</strong>.</p><p>Two weeks ago, the House ethics committee issued <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/nov/17/george-santos-expel-congress-ethics-report">a damning report</a> that found the New York congressman and admitted fabulist’s c

<p>Rolling coverage of the latest economic and financial news</p><p><strong>The Bank of England governor has warned that the “next leg” of a mission to reduce inflation will be hard.</strong></p><p>On a Andrew Bailey has told Newcastle’s ChronicleLive that bringing inflation all the way down to the Bank’s 2% target will require restrictive monetary policy.</p><p>“I’ve very much used this analogy of a game of two halves. They’re not equal but a lot of what we’re seeing at the moment, including that inflation came down a bit over 2%, and that’s very good news, is the unwinding of these inflationary effects of these external shocks.</p><p>And the rest of it has to be done by policy and monetary policy. And policy is operating in what I call a restrictive way at the moment - it is restricting the economy. The second half, from there to two, is hard work and obviously we don’t want to see any more damage.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2023/nov/27/global-investment

<p><strong>Royal Lyceum, Edinburgh</strong><br />Young Gerda is sent on an epic quest across mythical Scotland by steam train, cross-country skis, fishing boat and unicorn in Morna Young’s version</p><p>When the curtain goes up on this Caledonian Snow Queen, the view is both familiar and strange. Familiar, because we recognise the austere silhouette of Edinburgh’s Castle Rock at the back of Emily James’s set, as well as the curve of the theatre’s balcony reflected back at us as if we were looking in a mirror. But strange, because the rococo flourishes of the balcony seem to be morphing into the sides of a sledge. Lizzie Powell’s lights turn them an icy turquoise. Imagination has taken a grip on this looking-glass landscape.</p><p>There is something familiar and strange too about Morna Young’s adaptation, staged by Cora Bissett in a bold, expansive and richly musical production. She follows Hans Christian Andersen’s tale in outline with the expected story of 12-year-old Gerda (Rosie G

Once more, viewing figures will be enormous.</p><p>Would it surprise you to learn that a recent YouGov survey found that Team GB are the most popular sports team in the UK – ahead of England’s women footballers in second?

Adapted from the bestselling novel by Elizabeth Macneal, this six-parter follows the fortunes and misfortunes of Iris Whittle, a young woman who works as a painter of porcelain dolls. It sends out its gothic bat signals from the start. Many of the dolls are painted as likenesses of children, and most are commissioned by grieving parents as memorials to their deceased offspring. Iris and her reclusive sister Rose recreate these faces from photographs, keeping themselves amused with a game of “dead or alive”. They need some relief from the drudgery: both are employed by a harsh and parsimonious shopkeeper, Mrs Salter, who ensures they remain under the debt of gratitude to her for taking them in.</p><p>But Iris
