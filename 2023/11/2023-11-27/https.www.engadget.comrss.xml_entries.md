<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-best-cyber-monday-deals-2023-save-on-tech-at-amazon-target-walmart-and-others-170006758.html">Cyber Monday</a> has brought a truckload of deals on gaming gear for PCs, PS5, Xbox and Nintendo Switch alike. As always, most of those offers aren't really deals at all — but if you want a hand in upgrading your setup, we've scoured the many sales happening around the web and compiled the best Cyber Monday gaming deals we could find. While much of the Cyber Monday 2023 selection is left over from Black Friday, we're still seeing lower-than-usual prices on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-gaming-console-140057674.html">consoles</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/best-games/">games</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-gaming-monitor-140008940.html">gaming monitors</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-gaming-mouse-140004638.html">mice</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-gaming-keyboard-140019954.html">keyboards</a>, <

Amazon seems to reserve its best deals for three events: its two Prime Day sales and Black Friday/Cyber Monday. Nearly all of the deals are open to anyone, whether you are a Prime member or not, and many represent the lowest prices we've seen yet. For example, the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2RwL0IwOUJTMjZCOEI_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tNTM0LTIwIiwiY2

This year looks to be no different. To help ensure you buy a set that's actually worth your money, we've sorted through the sales and rounded up the best Cyber Monday TV deals we could find for 2023. Though many of these deals have technically been available for a few weeks, most represent the lowest prices we've seen. And while we don't formally review TVs at Engadget, we've thoroughly researched price histories and reviews from other sites we trust to ensure you get the right TV for your needs — whether it's a premium OLED TV, a budget-friendly model or just any sort of mammoth 75-inch screen.

<p>Cyber Monday 2023 is more than halfway over, but you can still shop a number of great deals on gadgets and gear right now. It's been a trend over the past couple of years for Black Friday deals to carry over into Cyber Monday, and 2023 is no different. While we saw a few surprises pop up today, the majority of the best tech deals have stayed steady over the past week or so (provided items have remained in stock). We're seeing major discounts on devices from Apple, Sonos, Samsung, Google, Dyson and many others, at various retailers like Amazon, Target, Best Buy and the like. If you see something on your wishlist or holiday gift list, don't hesitate as we expect most of these deals will expire before tomorrow. Here are the best Cyber Monday deals you still can get for 2023.</p>

<p>Tesla sued Sweden’s transportation agency and postal service on Monday over a union strike blocking the company’s license plate deliveries in the country. The workers are striking to demand the non-unionized automaker sign a collective bargaining agreement, a standard practice that mechanics’ union IF Metall describes as “the backbone of the Swedish model.” However, the Swedish Transport Agency says it already received an interim decision from a district court ordering it to consent within seven days to Tesla’s request to collect license plates or face hefty fines. The agency says it’s too early to say what exactly that means for the standoff.</p>
