<p dir="ltr">In the world of professional wrestling, fans are taught that the industry lives and dies on the simple phrase of "never say never." No matter what has transpired over the years, and no matter how unhirable someone has made themselves to top professional wrestling companies, a comeback is always possible--especially when there is money to be made. With that in mind, it shouldn't be as surprising as it is that CM Punk has returned to WWE, nearly a decade after his publicly messy departure from the company.</p><p dir="ltr">To fully explain the parting of ways and how bitter it was, there are a number of things to note. Firstly, Punk went through all of his side of the story in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4DHxnfsJBk">two appearances on Colt Cabana's The Art of Wrestling podcast</a>. In it, he discussed a number of health issues and injuries he went through during his WWE career. As a result of that podcast, WWE's senior ringside physician, Dr. Christopher Amann

Speaking to <a href="https://youtu.be/nWzOidt3Bok?feature=shared">The View</a>, Evans said if this is a real possibility, no one has reached out to him about it yet.</p><p>"I always see those reports too--it's news to me.

<p>2023 is coming to a close, and it looks like it'll be the first time in many years that Walt Disney Studios will not have a single movie crack $1 billion at the global box office.</p><p>As <a href="https://variety.com/2023/film/box-office/disney-bleak-box-office-streak-wish-the-marvels-1235809251/">Variety</a> reminds us, 2023 will be the first time since 2014 that Disney did not have a movie that made $1 billion or more at the box office. (This does not count the pandemic years of 2020 and 2021). For comparison, in 2019, Disney had a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-sets-a-new-box-office-record-and-star-wars-/1100-6472013/">whopping seven movies that made at least $1 billion.</a></p><p>Disney's biggest success of 2023 was Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, which earned more than $845 million at the box office.

<p>Back in 2018, Netflix invested millions of dollars in a sci-fi project called Conquest, only to never receive a single episode of the project. Instead, co-creator and director Carl Erik Rinsch allegedly mistreated cast and crew, and spent millions on cryptocurrency, luxury cars, and designer clothes.</p><p>Before Conquest, Rinsch had directed only one film: 47 Ronin, a critical and commercial failure. He was a protege of Ridley Scott, who worked as part of Scott's production company on commercials. He and his wife, Gabriela Rosés Bentancor, began to work on a sci-fi project on the side. The show concerned a genius who creates a humanlike species called the Organic Intelligent. Rinsch filmed brief proof-of-concept episodes, which drew the attention of multiple streaming giants. Netflix won the contract by promising millions more than its competitors and granting final-cut privileges for Rinsch.</p><p>A report from the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/22/business/carl-rinsch
