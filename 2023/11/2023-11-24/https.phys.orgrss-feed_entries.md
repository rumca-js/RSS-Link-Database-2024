Rice, maize, and wheat provide more than half of the calories consumed by humans. The decrease in crop diversity poses a significant risk to global food security. Therefore, the utilization of orphan crops has become an effective approach to address food security crises. Nevertheless, in the face of rapid urban and rural modernization and the intensification of agricultural practices, the availability of wild and cultivated orphan crops is dwindling, with a noticeable disparity in their collection, preservation, and application of modern breeding techniques.

Caulerpa is a type of marine algae made up of one extended cell, though each plant can grow to be a meter across. While there are many individual nuclei within a Caulerpa plant, it contains no cell membranes that would normally divide the plant into many individual cells, resulting in a free-floating environment of cytoplasmic goo. As a result, Caulerpa poses interesting questions for developmental biologists—how does it carry out the normal functions of plants without being made up of separate cells?
