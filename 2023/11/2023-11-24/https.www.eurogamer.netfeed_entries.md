Back in August, as part of this year's TennoCon celebrations, Warframe developer Digital Extremes <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warframes-next-big-expansion-whispers-in-the-walls-gets-weird-with-necramechs-and-retro-earth-tech">unveiled Whispers in the Walls</a>, the next (and extremely weird) chapter in the free-to-play sci-fi shooter's ongoing saga. And as its new confirmed December launch window approaches, the studio has shared a heap of new information on what to expect come the expansion's release, including confirmation it'll arrive alongside cross-save support.

Whispers in the Walls introduces new mission types, NPCs, bosses, and factions, a new hub known as The Sanctum, and a new procedural tile set. It's an expansion primarily focused on the long-hidden laboratory of Albrecht En

Super Mario RPG's recently released Switch remake is a lovely thing, freshening up a much-loved classic for a new generation, while ensuring its core remains faithful enough that it can deliver a wonderful blast of nostalgia for long-time fans. And it turns out that faithfulness runs deep, with players having discovered it restores a fun little easter egg that was cut from the original version during the localisation process for release outside of Japan.
</p><p>
More specifically, the 1996 Japanese version of Super Mario RPG contained a cute - if ultimately fairly pointless - sequence that would trigger if players entered the cheat code 'Down, Up, Right, Left, L, R, L, R, B' on the pause screen.
</p><p>
Rather than showering players with treats to make the experience a little easier or give everyone a massive head, as

We still do, actually, but we used to too. Today it relaunches with a host of new bespoke designs in a swathe of new categories, meaning you can now pick up zipped hoodies, stickers, posters and beanies in addition to more familiar shirts and mugs. Best of all, <strong>everything is 10 percent off for Black Friday</strong>. </p><p>The main difference with the new store, apart from the new designs and new categories, is that we're no longer printing on demand. All of what's available on the store has been ordered in advance, allowing us to achieve better print quality and have more freedom when choosing materials and suppliers. This should make for shirts, hoodies, beanies and other items that wear better in the long term, a quality-over-quantity attitude we've also applied to our sele

## Ubisoft blames Assassin's Creed in-game Black Friday pop-up ads on technical error

Ubisoft has said that pop-up adverts seen last night within Assassin's Creed games have now been disabled, and were the result of a technical error. 
</p><p>
The adverts, which promoted other games in the Assassin's Creed series that are currently on sale for Black Friday, were spotted by some players yesterday evening, prompting complaints online.
</p><p>
Players reported seeing the adverts pop-up when they paused the action to load the in-game map. One example shared on X, formerly Twitter, shows an advert for 20 percent off Assassin's Creed Mirage fill the screen when a player accesses the map within Assassin's Creed Odyssey.

The first Life is Strange game has been played by over 20 million people. 
</p><p>
The developer shared this milestone as part of a Thanksgiving post, stating it was grateful to everyone who had visited Arcadia Bay with Max and Chloe and experienced Life is Strange's time maniplating and emotionally charged story.
</p><p>
"We want to thank each and every one of you for playing," the account wrote, with an accompanying reel showing moments from the game (which made me get a little choked up, I won't lie).

Ned Luke, the actor behind GTA 5 main character Michael De Santa, has been swatted while playing the game for fans in a Thanksgiving livestream.
</p><p>
Luke's stream ended abruptly last night as sirens were heard in the background, and as he received a call warning him that police were outside. 
</p><p>
"Oh nice," he said. "Alright I've gotta go, now these assholes have swatted my house."

## Bayonetta creator Hideki Kamiya says he may take his ideas for the series "to the grave" with him

Original Bayonetta director Hideki Kamiya suspects many of his ideas for the series will be going to the grave with him. 
</p><p>
Kamiya's comments come as part of his most recent YouTube video, where the PlatinumGames co-founder said he fully expects the Bayonetta franchise to continue without him. 
</p><p>
"I worked on Bayonetta 1, 2, 3 and Origins," he said. "I've talked about this in various interviews, that the Bayonetta series would consist of a total of nine episodes, and that I wanted to grow the franchise as the Bayonetta 'Saga', but it seems like I may have to take the full saga to the grave with me."

As we enter the grey early days of winter, and as I seem to more frequently start each day with a Lemsip wafting restorative lemony goodness next to me, a game that offers the simple pleasures of bright colours and pleasing shapes is worth more and more. Inevitably, then, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/snakebird-complete-is-a-dazzler-and-its-map-is-just-ingenious">our game of the week is Snakebird Complete</a>, a Switch compilation of brilliant puzzley brainteasers that see you moving your bright, charming snakebirds past a range of obstacles and towards each level's exit goal.
</p><p>
Snakebird would be our game of the week even if it wasn't grey and chill outside. It's sheer playfulness and elegance, a game in which each level is a chance to experiment with the rules and learn more about the possibilities they contain. Like Bloc
