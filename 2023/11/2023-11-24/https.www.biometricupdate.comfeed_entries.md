Incorporating AI technologies in criminal investigation can expedite the process, generate high-quality leads, and enhance law enforcement efforts. However, as with any technological advancement, it raises important questions about ethics and the potential for misuse.

The most crucial aspect of criminal investigation is time. The faster the police can obtain leads and information, the more efficiently they can solve crimes, prevent escapes, and protect potential victims. Homicide detectives and experts always tell us that if you can’t find a lead within the first 48 hours, the chance of solving the case decreases exponentially.

This is where AI comes into play. Let’s explore the possib

		India has launched a social impact fund with a $25 million commitment to support the development of digital public infrastructure in the Global South, along with a <a href="https://www.dpi.global/">Global DPI Repository</a> (GDPIR) to share resources.

The announcement credits the G20 Digital Economy Working Group (DEWG) with leading the global push to support DPIs. That push also includes the UNDP’s <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202311/11-countries-pledge-to-establish-inclusive-dpi-as-50-in-5-campaign-launches">50-in-5</a> campaign, and the UNDP and India jointly released a <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202308/undp-and-india-team-up-for-digital-public-infrastructure-guidance-to-spur-sdg-catch-up">pair of resources</a> in August to speed DPI dev

		After a private initiative to establish a digital identity was shot down by voters in 2021, Switzerland is opting for a new state-run digital identity which could be launched as early as 2026.

The news of the new self-sovereign digital ID was announced on Wednesday after the Swiss Federal Council adopted a new law governing the scheme, the Federal Act on Electronic Identity Credentials and Other Electronic Credentials (BGEID), also known as the E-ID Act.

The E-ID Act comes two-and-a-half years after Swiss residents <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202103/swiss-voters-reject-digital-id-law-due-to-data-privacy-concerns">voted against</a> a law governing a proposed electronic identity system that would be controlled by the state but provided mainly

		Electronic visas have been hailed across the world as a solution that increases efficiency and security. But according to new research, an overwhelming majority of e-visa systems do not take advantage of technologies like biometric matching, document scanning and validation, watchlist comparison, or even e-visa management. Instead, most e-visas systems are little more than an online visa application portal and do little to help the work of immigration authorities, an analysis from <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/travizory-border-security-sa">Travizory Border Security</a> has revealed.

The Swiss border technology company analyzed visa systems of 75 countries across Latin America, Africa, Asia-Pacific and the Middle East.

		The facial recognition market in India is currently hotter than a ghost pepper vindaloo. Expanding Dubai firm <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/recfaces">RecFaces</a> is set to be in the middle of it all with the opening of an office in Delhi, which will feature a live demo studio where customers can trial run products such as Id-Guard, a biometric video detection tool, and Id-Gate, an access control and gate management platform that leverages facial recognition (<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202310/recfaces-deploys-biometric-access-system-for-el-salvadoran-government-building">recently installed</a> in the Legislative Assembly of El Salvador).

		In Pakistan, biometric systems are in use at both ends of the family identity spectrum; to verify its identity, and to confirm its fracture.

The National Database &amp; Registration Authority (<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/nadra">NADRA</a>) has enabled processing of family registration certificates through the mobile app, Pak-ID. Aaj English TV <a href="https://www.aajenglish.tv/news/30339723/nadras-pak-id-app-streamlines-process-of-family-registration">reports</a> that heirs applying for the certificates will be required to post public notices on NADRA’s website and provide mandatory biometric verification, be it local or remote from a foreign nation.

		In recent years, both the private and public sectors in India have increasingly adopted facial recognition systems to transform video surveillance. The implementation of facial recognition can vary widely, but in many cases necessitates edge cameras or a cloud component. The specific approach chosen depends on the application requirements, available resources, and desired performance level.

However, integrating facial recognition systems into video surveillance with edge cameras offers several advantages and enhances system performance through real-time identification. Among the additional benefits are improved security, enhanced situational awareness, reduced false alarms, preservation of privacy, minimal latency, scalability, and the ability to operate offline.

		The UK government is planning to introduce changes to its data protection laws giving counter-terrorism police more power over biometric data.

According to the new amendments to the Data Protection and Digital Information Bill, counter-terrorism police will be able to hold on to the biometric data of individuals who pose a potential threat as long as an Interpol notice is in force. The change will put the UK’s regulation in line with Interpol’s own retention rules.

The amendments will also ensure that police can indefinitely retain biometric data of individuals who have a foreign conviction, in the same way as is already possible for individuals with UK convictions.

		The next generation of iPhones may not come with <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/apple">Apple</a>’s biometric fingerprint sensor TouchID, according to whispers from the Chinese social media network Weibo.

Most of the equipment used to manufacture the chips required for the iPhone’s version of Touch ID has reportedly been shut down, pointing towards the conclusion that Apple will no longer be unlocking phones with fingerprint identification, MacRumors <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/22/touch-id-will-not-return-on-iphone-16/">reported</a> citing an anonymous Weibo account.
