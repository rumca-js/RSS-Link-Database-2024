  <p id="ohsin2">The Shein pop-up store in New York this month resembled the e-commerce giant’s website, except picture-perfect. Neutral-toned clothing hung on neat racks, next to party dresses that cost less than the cocktail you might drink while wearing them. Bargain-priced wall art and other home decor created a fantasy of living somewhere chic and stylish, without spending thousands. Like the Shein haul videos that go viral online, the pop-up store sold not just physical items, but also a vision: shoppers could have everything they wanted, and Shein could deliver it for cheap.</p>

  <p id="bqHWit">Ubisoft is blaming an unspecified “technical error” for a fullscreen pop-up ad that appeared in <em>Assassin’s Creed Odyssey</em> this week. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/181fbvn/just_got_an_ingame_advertisement_when_i_tried_to/">Reddit users say they spotted</a> the pop-up on Xbox and PlayStation versions of the game, with an ad appearing just when you navigate to the map screen. “This is disgusting to experience while playing,” remarked one Reddit user, summarizing the general feeling against such pop-ups in the middle of gameplay.</p>
