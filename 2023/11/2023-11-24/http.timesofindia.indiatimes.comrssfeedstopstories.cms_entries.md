With no sign of abatement of the turf war between the Centre and the Delhi government and a new front opening over the selection of the chief secretary of the national capital territory, the Supreme Court on Friday devised a unique method to insulate those in the zone of consideration from social media discussion by asking the Centre to bring a panel of seasoned civil servants to the court on Tuesday. A ruling that seeks a balance between the Delhi government's claim that it had the sole prerogative to select the key bureaucrat and the Centre's insistence that, after the change of the law, the matter belonged squarely in its domain.

RBI deputy governor M Rajeshwar Rao has cautioned about 'dark patterns' in mis-selling of digital loans where customers are deceived into availing high-cost loans. The deputy governor has also said that RBI will relook at risk management framework for lenders on liquidity and market risk. According to Rao, mis-selling has taken on a digital form known as 'dark patterns'. These design interfaces and tactics are intended to deceive users into specific behaviours, such as obtaining high-cost, short-term consumer credit under the guise of an instant loan.
