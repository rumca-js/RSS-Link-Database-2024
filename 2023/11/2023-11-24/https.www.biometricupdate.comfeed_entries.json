However, as with any technological advancement, it raises important questions about ethics and the potential for misuse.\n\nThe most crucial aspect of criminal investigation is time. The faster the police can obtain leads and information, the more efficiently they can solve crimes, prevent escapes, and protect potential victims. Homicide detectives and experts always tell us that if you can\u2019t find a lead within the first 48 hours, the chance of solving the case decreases exponentially.\n\nThis is where AI comes into play.
