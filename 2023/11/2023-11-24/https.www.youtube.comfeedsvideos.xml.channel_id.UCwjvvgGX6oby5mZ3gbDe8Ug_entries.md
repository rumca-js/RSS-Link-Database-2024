The global business community used to predict that with epidemic restrictions being lifted in China, the global supply chain would return to normal, and countries like Vietnam, India, or Mexico would lose their appeal. At present, shipping prices have plummeted over the past year, restrictions have been removed, and Chinese manufacturers across all sectors are aggressively soliciting business through deep discounts. But the global supply chain isnâ€™t returning to what it was like before. There's no going back. More multinationals and investment groups are fleeing China.
