The rise of Tiger Woods, to not only the dominant figure in golf but one of the most recognisable individuals in the world, occurred because of what transpired with clubs in hand rather than in front of microphones.

<p>Young Briton has struggled with injuries all year but since his return before the US Open he has quickly found his level</p><p>As Jack Draper crumpled into a chair and covered his face after an afternoon of high-octane, quality tennis concluded in disappointment in the opening stanza of Great Britain’s 2-0 defeat to Serbia, his despair was clear for all to see. With Novak Djokovic looming in the second rubber of their Davis Cup quarter-final tie, practically every spectator in Málaga’s sold-out Palacio de los Deportes José María Martín Carpena was aware how essential the first was.</p><p>After two bitter tiebreaks, the match had escaped him. But Draper had not taken many wrong steps on the court. He had fought tooth and nail to remain in the opening set before his level dropped in the tiebreak, then he had performed strongly until the end of a second set that came down to a couple of points.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/nov/24/jack-draper-davis-cup-defeat-an

When it comes to wine, that tends to mean French classics such as chablis, Saint-Émilion and châteauneuf-du-pape, all of which are usually heavily promoted over the festive period. Arguably, they’re all good with traditional Christmas fare, but their prices generally reflect that: sancerre, for example, routinely costs between £18 and £25 these days.</p><p>I’m also betting that a significant number of readers will not be celebrating Christmas with turkey, and may well be having something from an entirely different culinary tradition. So why not branch out on the wine, too? This year, I’ve been drinking Greek, Georgian and even Brazilian wine. More about those in the new year, though I do quit

<p>Baby Dior isn’t the only brand marketing products to newborns – including a $210 box of ‘essentials’ and $70 moisturizer</p><p>The concept of “baby-soft skin” – a naturally plump, dewy, and glowing face – has been the beauty industry’s gold standard for decades. So why is the industry now trying to sell these bundles of joy bottles of moisturizer, cleanser and perfume?</p><p>This month, Baby Dior unveiled a so-called “complete skincare line for little ones”. Think babies, who enter this world with that delicious milky, soapy newborn smell, don’t need perfume? You could be wrong, as the one per cent can now mist their children with Dior’s Bonne Étoile, a $230 “scented water” that has whiffs of pear, wild rose, and white musk. Pear also features in Le Lait Très Tendre, an all-body moisturizer that goes for $115. For those who wish to “turn baby’s bath time ritual into a precious moment”, Dior offers a $95 bottle of face, body and hair foam. At the same price, one can buy a “cleaning

<p>The retired NFL great’s brutal assessment was harsh. But as GMs try to hack the cap by relying on rookie QBs before they’re ready, the results are no surprise</p><p>No sports entity markets itself quite like the NFL. The shots of rabid fans idolizing legends in the making, the countless hours of pregame buildup, the wild popularity of fantasy football, the alternate broadcasts, the push to grow internationally. For most of the last two decades, no league has fed its marketing department as much red meat as the NFL. But when it comes to the on-field product, this season has been pedestrian from an offensive standpoint and especially putrid when it comes to quarterback play.</p><p>Tom Brady, who was part of more than a few marquee matchups in his 23-year NFL career, blasted the state of football on ESPN uberpundit Stephen A Smith’s radio show earlier this week.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/nov/24/tom-brady-nfl-mediocrity-quarterback-salary-cap">Continue r

<p>A sweeping but gossipy behind-the-scenes look at the off-screen dramas that made prestige TV</p><p>Peter Biskind is a cinema man. Best known for 1998’s Easy Riders, Raging Bulls and other books about the meaty, macho movie business, he has turned his attentions to the growth of streaming services and what might be the end of the current golden age of TV. The swaggering Pandora’s Box attempts to wrangle a complex tale into some sort of order, from the early days of prestige TV, to the high-stakes and seemingly bottomless business of “content creation”. But in the acknowledgments that conclude the book, Biskind still offers a secular prayer for the return of his preferred medium. “Movies, I hope, will one day make a comeback,” he writes. For now, television will have to do.</p><p>Biskind begins with, and frequently returns to, HBO, which began in 1972 as a cable channel showing films and sporting events for a fee, before growing into a home for series so reputable that it could get

<p>Yes, the fallen foliage can be messy. But the trees know just what they’re doing – and they won’t thank you for interfering</p><p>It’s a 66m-year-old decision. Some trees got there much quicker; some took a little longer. But most of the broad-leaved trees that we know and love – the magnolias, plane trees, elms, beech, walnuts, limes, oaks, maples and horse chestnuts – made a calculated decision to drop their leaves come autumn. Large, soft leaves are hard to protect in the winter weather, so the trees evolved to lose them, but not their valuable resources.</p><p>Leaf fall is a precision art for a deciduous tree – it’s a salvage operation on the greatest scale as the tree works quickly to bank the resources hidden inside the pigments of the leaves. The greens of chlorophyll go first, then the yellows of the xanthonoids, and then the orange carotenoids, until all that is left is brown – at which point the tree lets its foliage go.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentis

<p>This week marked 60 years since President John F Kennedy was shot dead as he travelled in the back of a car through the streets of Dallas, Texas. From the moment the news broke, people had their theories about what happened.</p><p>So why did the assassination of JFK spawn dozens of conspiracy theories that have persisted for decades? Is there a reason why Americans are quick to believe their government is covering something up? And despite multiple examples of when conspiracies turn dangerous, are politicians today, including Kennedy’s own nephew, using conspiracy theories for political gain?</p><p>This week, Jonathan Freedland speaks to Prof Kathryn Olmsted, author of Real Enemies: Conspiracy Theories and American Democracy, World War I to 9/11</p><p><em>Archive: CBS, USA Today, CNN</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/audio/2023/nov/24/did-the-assassination-of-jfk-kickstart-the-conspiracy-theory-movement-podcast">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Forget Doctor Who, this Big Little Lies-esque Australian drama really lets the actor spread her wings. It’s a glossy female-centred look at buried secrets that’s full of important questions</p><p>Who owns a story? Can there ever be a single truth about anything? Or even one we can all agree to privilege above the others? These are resonant questions in a time of ever-shifting social, political and cultural certainties, of alternative realities being proffered by social media influencers, activists and random individuals keen to assert their hot take – however well/badly informed it is. We are living in a time of benign and malicious falsehoods whizzing round the earth a hundred times before basic facts have even begun searching for their boots, and with AI poised to vacuum up the last shreds of human integrity.</p><p>One Night, a six-part Australian mystery drama created and written by Emily Ballou (The Slap) and directed by Catherine Millar (The Secrets She Keeps) and Lisa Matthe

He becomes preoccupied by an abandoned baseball cap, my beer and the transmission risk of the packed dining room. “Do people still get Covid?” he asks. “Shall we go outside?” (It is freezing.) He frets about “ambient noise” affecting my recorder, looking at the couple next to us and the empty table a little further away. “Do you want to tell them to go over there? I couldn’t, but you could,” he says, laughing.</p><p>He is certainly jetlagged, but otherwise it’s hard to identify the s

Blake Montgomery explains</p><p>Sam Altman has been a reassuring figure to anyone worried about the future of artificial intelligence. As the head of OpenAI, which started out as a non-profit organisation that aimed to ensure AI was used for the good of humanity, he has toured the world, speaking to world leaders about this new frontier of technology.</p><p>But last Friday, Altman was summarily sacked – seemingly without warning. And the result was uproar in one of the world’s most influential AI companies. More than 95% of staff signed an open letter demanding his return – including, confusingly, the interim CEO who was brought in to replace him, and a board member instrumental in his firing.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2023/nov/24/sam-altman-chaos-heart-ai-industry-podcast">Continue reading...</

<p>A mouthwatering clash in Manchester, Forest making do without Awoniyi and Everton hosting in a real cauldron</p><p>Is Erling Haaland fit? He thinks so. Which of these gladiatorial contenders will adopt a higher line? Might there be touchline antics from Pep Guardiola and Jürgen Klopp? And which of the Premier League leaders and the second-placed side will emerge on top? For subplots, sideshows and headline narratives, Manchester City’s hosting of Liverpool on Saturday lunchtime is this weekend’s only game in town, such an enticing prospect that whatever occurs cannot – surely – be anything other than riveting. Haaland v Salah will be a duel of two supreme attacking forces so, if there is to be a victor, who defends best may be the defining factor in what is only match No 13 of each protagonist’s title challenge. <strong>Jamie Jackson</strong></p><p><em>Manchester City v Liverpool, Saturday 12.30pm (all times GMT)</em></p><p><em>Burnley v West Ham, Saturday 3pm</em></p><p><em>Luton
