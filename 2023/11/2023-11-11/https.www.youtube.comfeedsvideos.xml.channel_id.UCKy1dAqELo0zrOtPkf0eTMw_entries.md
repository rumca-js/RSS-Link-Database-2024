Monarch is the mysterious thread connecting the world of the Monsterverse. With Monarch: Legacy of Monsters on the way, there’s a lot coming to this multiverse! Monarch has roots spreading through the entire storyline, and Monarch: Legacy of Monsters should tell us more about the history of creatures like Godzilla.

In the Monarch: Legacy of Monsters trailer, Kurt Russell plays a character with a lot of secrets about Monarch. Apple TV will be home of the Monarch legacy series that will finally (hopefully) explain Monarch. Cast members are in place all over several decades spanning the story explaining the “legacy of monsters” with Wyatt Russell even playing a younger version of his father’s character, perhaps even before the time we first met King Kong in Kong: Skull Island. If you think Godzilla (2014) was the beginning, it actually goes much deeper!

We’re exploring the history even before that and through Godzilla: King of the Monsters, Godzilla vs King Kong, and even the lesser k

Spoilers for The Marvels! The mid-credits scene for The Marvels is far more than just an x-citing cameo.

## Deadpool 3 is 2024's Only MCU Movie - IGN The Fix: Entertainment

In today's Fix of entertainment news:
In light of the recent WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes (that have finally ended), Disney and Marvel have reshuffled their upcoming film slate, and it looks like Deadpool 3 is the only MCU movie set to be released in 2024. July 25th, to be exact. MCU movies being pushed to 2025 are: Captain America: New World Order, Blade, Fantastic Four, and The Thunderbolts. Maybe the slight lull in Marvel releases is a good thing: the market has been pretty saturated with superhero offerings over the past few years. In other news, Warner Bros. has shelved another nearly-complete film: Coyote vs. ACME. The film was a hybrid animation/live-action comedy (a la Who Framed Roger Rabbit?) that starred John Cena and was basically about the goofy Wile E. Coyote from the Looney Tunes suing the infamous ACME corporation. The film was produced by James Gunn, and was reportedly shelved as a cost-saving measure. It joins Batgirl and a Scooby-Doo movie on the unfortunate list of p

## Modern Warfare 3 Maps Pulled Because of Horrendously Bad Spawn Points - IGN Daily Fix

In today's Daily Fix:
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3's launch has not bee smooth sailing so far. The campaign is being hit with some of the franchise's worst reviews (we gave it a 4 out of 10), and now the multiplayer is facing harsh criticism because of some really bad spawn points. Some maps in some modes have players spawning literally next to enemy players, making spawn camping incredibly easy. As a result, certain maps are being pulled while the developers address the issue. In other news, Warner Bros. is under fire for its latest DLC for Mortal Kombat 1—specifically, charging $10 for a fatality. And when gamers complained, they released a $30 fatality bundle. Crazy world we live in where we have to pay for fatalities in a Mortal Kombat game. And finally, developers of the latest Like a Dragon game are getting their franchise games mixed up. Some references in The Man Who Erased His Name are to things that aren't even in the game, but are in other Yakuza/Like a Dragon titles. In
