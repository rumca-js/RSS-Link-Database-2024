According to a new paper by scientists from a dozen institutions, the world's average temperature will surpass 1.5°C above preindustrial times within the next several years—much faster than most existing forecasts. The study goes on to say that without extreme action by the international community, temperatures will reach 2°C above preindustrial levels before 2050—also faster than most predictions.

## A new theory linking evolution and physics has scientists baffled—but is it solving a problem that doesn't exist?

In October, a paper titled "Assembly theory explains and quantifies selection and evolution" appeared in the journal Nature. The authors—a team led by Lee Cronin at the University of Glasgow and Sara Walker at Arizona State University—claim their theory is an "interface between physics and biology" which explains how complex biological forms can evolve.

Two things are needed to understand how the universe came into being and how it has evolved to its present form. Cosmological computer models employ the laws of physics to depict the universe's expected appearance today, while observations made with telescopes check whether these models are correct.

## Farmers or foragers? Pre-colonial Aboriginal food production was hardly that simple

For almost 10 years, debate has raged over the book Dark Emu by Aboriginal historian Bruce Pascoe. In it, Pascoe argues many pre-colonial Aboriginal groups were farmers, pointing to examples like eel aquaculture in Victoria, and grain planting and threshing of native millet in the arid center.

## Recording the first daily measurements of Earth's rotation shifts

Researchers at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) have succeeded in measuring the Earth's rotation more exactly than ever before. The ring laser at the Geodetic Observatory Wettzell can now be used to capture data at a quality level unsurpassed anywhere in the world. The measurements will be used to determine the Earth's position in space, benefit climate research, and make climate models more reliable.

## Many physicists assume we must live in a multiverse—but their basic math may be wrong

One of the most startling scientific discoveries of recent decades is that physics appears to be fine-tuned for life. This means that for life to be possible, certain numbers in physics had to fall within a certain, very narrow range.

## Animals skin patterns are a matter of physics—research could improve medical diagnostics and synthetic materials

Patterns on animal skin, such as zebra stripes and poison frog color patches, serve various biological functions, including temperature regulation, camouflage and warning signals. The colors making up these patterns must be distinct and well separated to be effective. For instance, as a warning signal, distinct colors make them clearly visible to other animals. And as camouflage, well-separated colors allow animals to better blend into their surroundings.

Iceland declared a state of emergency on Friday after a series of powerful earthquakes rocked the country's southwestern Reykjanes peninsula, in what could be a precursor to a volcanic eruption.

## Want higher graduation rates? New study shows public spending on families is key

A new study, conducted in collaboration between researchers at Michigan State University and Central Michigan University, found that public spending on social safety net programs and on education spending each independently impact high school graduation rates, which are a key predictor of health and well-being later in life.
