Austin, Texas, band Briscoe formed around the nucleus of friends Philip Lupton and Truett Heintzelman. The pair graduated from the University of Texas in May 2023, and shortly before the release of their debut album, "West of It All," they opened for the Dave Matthews Band at the iconic Gorge Amphitheater in Washington State. 

It wasn’t the first opening slot for Briscoe. They had previously visited Minnesota in April 2023 while opening for Ruston Kelly in the First Avenue Mainroom. In October, they returned for their own headlining slot at the 7th Street Entry. The day after, Briscoe visited The Current studio to play three songs from "West of It All" and to chat with host Mac Wilson.

During their conversation, Lupton and Heintzelman talked about their achievements so far, what it was like recording their album with North Carolina (by way of Wisconsin) producer Brad Cook, and what they’re looking forward to when they get back to Austin.
