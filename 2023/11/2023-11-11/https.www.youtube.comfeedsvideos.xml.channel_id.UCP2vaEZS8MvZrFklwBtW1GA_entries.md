Custom shower niche waterproofing...I start with the inside KERDI-KERECK corners then overlap those by 2-inches with banding. The outside corners can be tricky, and one huge tip is to dip the corner of the corner in water - this makes it flexible and keeps it flat against the board. I didn't mention this in the video but should have because it works.
