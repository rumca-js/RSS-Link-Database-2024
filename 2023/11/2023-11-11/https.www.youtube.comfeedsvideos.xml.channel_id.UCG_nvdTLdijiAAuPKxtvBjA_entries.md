Five Nights at Freddy's is a film adaptation of the horror video game FNAF that was made popular by legends of that era like Pewdiepie and Markiplier and Game Theory. And it's very successful and liked by the fans. The only problem is that it's not a movie but rather a video game movie. In this video, let's see what that means. Why the FNAF movie fails to stand on its own as a film.
