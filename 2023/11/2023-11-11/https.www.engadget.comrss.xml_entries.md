<p>A <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/spacex-musk-safety/"><em>Reuters</em></a> investigation into unsafe working conditions at SpaceX has uncovered more than 600 injuries going back to 2014 that have not been publicly reported until now. Current and former employees cited in the report blame CEO Elon Musk’s aggressive deadlines and hatred of bureaucracy, alleging his goal of getting humans to Mars “as fast as possible” has led the company to cut corners and eschew proper protocols.</p>
<p>Injury rates at some SpaceX facilities are much higher than the industry average of .8 injuries or illnesses per 100 workers, <em>Reuters</em> found. At its Brownsville, Texas location, the 2022 injury rate was 4.8 per 100 workers. At the Hawthorne, California manufacturing facility, it was 1.8. In McGregor, Texas, where the company conducts rocket tests, the injury rate was 2.7.</p>

<p>The live-action adaptation of the classic shonen manga and anime <em>YuYu Hakusho</em> is hitting Netflix on December 14, and the streaming service has given fans some idea of what they can expect in a short teaser video. Live-action adaptations of anime shows are a hit or miss. Some, like Netflix's <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/death_note_2017"><em>Death Note</em></a>, were generally panned and poorly received, while others like the <em>Rurouni Kenshin</em> movies starring Takeru Satoh and Netflix's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-29-netflix-one-piece-live-action.html"><em>One Piece</em></a> had managed to win over existing fans and new audiences alike.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a long-time fan of Yoshihiro Togashi's<em> YuYu Hakusho</em>, I have witnessed fellow fans dread its arrival after the streaming service published the first posters for the series. Certain actors were a miscast, they said, and even the actors in <em>YuYu Hakusho's</em> stage production had bet

<p>NVIDIA really, really doesn't want to lose access to China's massive AI chip market. The company is developing three new AI chips especially for China that don't run afoul of the latest export restrictions in the US, according to <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/nvidia-develops-new-ai-chips-again-to-keep-selling-to-china-d6977a03?st=b9nqhs4y78r65k2&amp;mod=googlenewsfeed"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a> and <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/nvidia-plans-release-three-new-chips-china-local-media-2023-11-09/"><em>Reuters</em></a>.

<p>Netflix’s new prestige sci-fi show is delayed until March 22, 2024. <em>3 Body Problem</em> was originally scheduled to debut in 2023, before being pushed back to January 2024, and now March. Just as the initial delay was accompanied by <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflixs-3-body-problem-first-look-confirms-january-2024-premiere-213927002.html">a teaser trailer</a>, so too is this one:</p>

<p><em>3 Body Problem</em> is being adapted by David Benioff and D.B. Weiss (who created HBO's <em>Game of Thrones</em>) alongside screenwriter Alexander Woo. The new trailer gives us our first look at the series’ key “video game,” <em>Three-Body</em>, which involves a nebulous and extremely shiny VR headset. According to John Bradley’s character Jack Rooney, the headset has &quot;no screen... no headphone jack... not even a charging port.&quot; Donning the headset transport
