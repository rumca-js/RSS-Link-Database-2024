Listen, I don’t really understand how Wish still exists. Does anyone actually buy stuff from there? I feel like Alibaba and Temu are better deal usually, and both are equally likely to be rip-offs. I guess it might honestly be okay compared to the way Amazon is getting. I digress. We built a gaming setup using only products from Wish. How bad could it be?
