<p>The expensive appliances claim to eliminate kitchen food waste by turning it to instant compost. But experts are skeptical</p><p>Michelle Cehn, founder of the popular Instagram account @vegan, built her reputation around her love for the planet – but food waste was something that she struggled with. “I’ve been wanting to compost, but I’ve always been really overwhelmed by an outdoor compost pile,” she said in a voiceover of a recent <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CzeSI7pRDnj/">post</a> that showed her picking fresh vegetables from the vine. “And so this year I started composting indoors with the Lomi electric composter.” In the short video, Cehn went on to explain how she simply dropped food scraps into the small electric bin on her countertop, pressed the button, and was left with “nutrient-rich plant food” a few hours later that she could use in her garden.</p><p>Lomi, the device Cehn was hyping, is just one of a new cohort of gadgets claiming they can eliminate kitchen fo

But few of the customers touring their decks seemed to care that buying the former would help drown the latter. “I don’t think about this yet,” said Elena Papernaya, an artist who had set her eyes on a mid-sized yacht, when asked if she worried about the damage it would do to the climate.</p><p>Kasper Hojgaard, a regional manager for an industrial company who charters yachts for a few weeks each year, said he did not consider climate change “at all” when doing so.

<p>Over the course of a day, six astronauts reflect on their relationship with Earth in Harvey’s profound and lyrical fifth novel </p><p>Samantha Harvey’s four previous novels have roamed through vastly different settings, but their common subject is her characters’ inner landscape, and the ways in which perceptions are altered by time and memory. Her unconventional plots are shaped less by external incident than by philosophical inquiry into the nature of existence and how we make meaning from a life, often from the perspective of distance or in the shadow of death. <em>Orbital</em>, her fifth novel, takes this idea to its logical conclusion; six astronauts of different nationalities, four men and two women, observe the Earth over the course of a day from the International Space Station, 250 miles above its surface.</p><p>In orbit, the astronauts are as untethered from time as they are from gravity; in one 24-hour cycle they will see 16 sunrises and sunsets. “You’re bound to Coordin
