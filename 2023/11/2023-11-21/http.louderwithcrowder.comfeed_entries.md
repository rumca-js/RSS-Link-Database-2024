	Oldheads reading this won't be surprised to know that Susan Sarandon spoke at a pro-Hamas rally. Anyone younger will need to fire up the Google to find out who she is. Long story short, elderly actress who can always be counted on to side with socialists and others on the radical left. Her recent antisemitic rant caused a Muslim woman living in America to tell her where to stick it.
</p><p>
	Sarandon told a crowd of Hamas supporters, "There are a lot of people that are afraid, that are afraid of being Jewish at this time, and are getting a taste of what it feels like to be a Muslim in this country.”
</p><p>
	I was unable to find a video of her saying this. I DID, however, find a video of her standing there in the cruelty of her white privilege to provide the context in which the October 7th "assault" happened. Yes, explainin

	Wednesday is the busiest drinking day of the year. We here at the Louder with Crowder Dot Com website care deeply about your safety. Plus, you can't click links if you're in a hospital. Should you find yourself out with friends, we ask that you please listen to the following suggestions.
</p><ol>
<li>Don't drink and drive.</li>
<li>Don't drink too much ... drink just enough</li>
<li>If you see a group of Marines at the club, don't swing on them.</li>

	A dude in Austin didn't follow rule #3 over the weekend. He is now on the wrong end of a viral video.
</p><p>
	It is unclear what started the fight. The X-post accompanying this video claims an angry woman snagged a phone and threw it into the street. It is unclear if it was this woman that one of the Marines was attempting to calm down.

In no other part of the world was this more relevant than the UK and the Just Stop Oil nincompoops. You know, the people who block traffic and wonder why everyone hates them so much. Even vegans take a break from screaming at people eating meat in front of them to roll their eyes at the JSOs.</p><p>One bystanding Brit had enough. As these nutters were blocking traffic to save the planet while causing cars to idle and spew more emissions into the planet, he took the JSOs to school. Everything they own?
