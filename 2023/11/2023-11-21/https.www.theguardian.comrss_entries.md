<p>This bafflingly bland offering wastes the talents of Melissa McCarthy and Paapa Essiedu – it’s as if they removed the laughs in case they offend </p><p>Screenwriter Richard Curtis is a cinema colossus with nothing left to prove: he reinvented the romcom with transatlantic classics like Four Weddings, Notting Hill and The Tall Guy; he re-energised charitable giving with Comic Relief; and even those of us who never signed up to Love Actually concede the dark power of the Emma Thompson-crying scene. But we really do not need this new Christmas film from him (he writes, Sam Boyd directs), an unremittingly awful, bafflingly terrible and defanged bit of seasonal gibberish: a fantasy comedy which forgets to put in gags and which cheats its own narrative rules. Watching it is like trailing around a year-round Christmas market in March.</p><p>Paapa Essiedu plays a chap with the quirky name of Bernard Bottle, employed in New York (cue Christmassy shots of people skating in Rockefeller Plaza

<p><strong>Royal Academy, London<br /></strong>Sterile sketches by Monet, Degas and Renoir make you grateful they mostly stuck to painting – but Toulouse-Lautrec and Van Gogh’s empathy and emotion steal the show</p><p>Impressionists on Paper is a bitty ramble of a show, despite some drop dead masterpieces. Its title betrays its lack of purpose. Impressionists! On paper! For as the curators assume we all know, the French artists who shocked conservative taste in the 1870s are renowned as painter’s painters. They put their easels in the open air and caught the changing light. Yet here they draw. But that’s not a revelation at all. Renoir’s drawings of women are just as bland as his paintings.</p><p>Only one drawing in the first room grips me. A sketch by Manet of people fleeing the rain in a Paris street is full of the unexpectedness of actual life: it’s a dynamic “impression”, apparently drawn from a window, of hunched pedestrians in hats making for shelter.

<p>A new documentary examines the work of bestselling author Shere Hite and her absence from the feminist canon</p><p>Depending on your age, you likely either have some feelings about Shere Hite or know nothing about her. In 1976, Hite, an independent researcher of qualitative experience, sparked a “revolution in the bedroom”, as Ms Magazine put it, with her anonymous surveys on female sexuality.

She was a frank interviewer and thus a lightning rod for criticism, having committed the cardinal sin of promoting female pleasure, which many took as demoting men, and then, in subsequent books, describing how men really felt (lonely, isolated, emotionally stifled) and women’s feelings on love.

<p><strong>Coliseum, London<br /></strong>A colossal cast of singers, dancers, acrobats and contortionists take your breath away in this epic and moving story of betrayal and parental sacrifice</p><p>This show, about the glories of ancient nomadic empire, comes galloping from Mongolia like a magnificently over-the-top Cultural Olympiad. Set more than 2,000 years ago, before Genghis Khan’s almighty reign on the central Asian steppe, it begins with two exquisite dancing foxes and expands to a formidable 70-plus cast of singers, dancers, acrobats and contortionists who dazzle even if the story itself is ponderous.</p><p>Adapted from a three-act tragedy by Lkhagvasuren Bavuu, it follows the fictional story of Archug Khan (Erdenebileg Ganbold). King of the Hunnus, or Huns, he is caught in a succession dilemma when his wife (Uranchimeg Urtnasan) and his consort (Dulguun Odkhuu) each give birth to a future heir. This sets off a drama of betrayal, adultery and the switching of two babies in

<p>How the Streets of Rage and Etrian Odyssey composer was inspired by disco, city pop, and slyly recording music from arcade cabinets</p><p>From the urban warzones of Shinobi and Streets of Rage to the high fantasy realms of Ys and Etrian Odyssey, Japanese composer Yuzo Koshiro has seen (and heard) it all. His engineering wizardry helped establish video game music as a force to be reckoned with, alongside its cinematic and televisual siblings. His foresight allowed him to retain the rights to his own music, in an industry that’s often keen on prising the art from the artist. In so many ways, and across so many disciplines, Koshiro has always been ahead of his time.</p><p>And it all began with him secretly recording the music from his favourite games in arcades. “When I was a teenager, spending time at amusement arcades, game developers would only release a few video game titles in a year,” he explains. “However, each game had its own distinct electronic sound that set them apart, cr

Thomas’s main gig is bodybuilding, but like many semi-professionals in the world of sports entertainment and performance, she engages in various side-hustles to make ends meet. One of the strengths of Philipp Fussenegger’s documentary portrait of her is that it is not wholly a feelgood story of uplifting empowerment, nor is it a relentlessly grim look at a life lived on the margins. Instead, it shows how for Thomas (as for most people), the highs and lows blend and overlap, and tend not to obey the neat narrative arcs of fiction.</p><p>In other respects though, this is a documentary that does feel rather like fiction.

<p>No decent person could disagree with the radio host’s account of political failure in Britain. But what does he think needs to be done about it?</p><p>Some books are peculiarly review-proof. I don’t mean that whatever one says will have no effect on their success, though in the case of James O’Brien’s <em>How They Broke Britain</em>, which comprises an extended “charge sheet” of the nine men and one woman its author believes set the UK on a course of unnecessary decline, this is indubitably the case. The book is already a bestseller; a recent event promoting it required a venue change, so great was the demand for tickets.</p><p>No, what I mean is that some books, at least in the current landscape, are hard to criticise; to argue with them is to incorporate yourself, however unwittingly, into the framework they purport to stand against. A critic from the right who picks a fight with <em>How They Broke Britain</em> may be dismissed by O’Brien as just another hateful ideologue or cli

He boasted that Israel had never known a more peaceful and prosperous time than the roughly 16 years he has been in power. It was under his successive administrations that Israel installed the Iron Dome system to intercept rockets from the Gaza Strip, and constructed, along the Gaza border, a 40-mile, $1.1bn fence, equipped with underground sensors, remote-controlled weapons and an expansive camera system.

<p>It’s been called the Pulling for Gen Z, an extreme comedy about debt, death, sex and slippers. The sisters who star in the deliciously dark new show reveal how they mined their chaotic lives for belly laughs</p><p>In the spring of 2020, as the country entered lockdown for the first time, sisters Kat Sadler and Lizzie Davidson had a long-overdue catchup on the phone. They both had terrible news to share: Davidson had accrued £20,000 worth of debt while Sadler had experienced a “complete mental health crash” and been sectioned after attempting to end her life twice.</p><p>Did the pair respond to each other with solemn compassion? Not exactly. In fact they instantly decided it was “terrifying but also hilarious that we’d ended up in these positions in our lives,” says Sadler. “We’re not serious people, so even the attempt to be serious on the phone telling each other what had gone on, we just couldn’t do it.” Davidson agrees: “We always find the absurdity in everything – that’s our c

The worst moment, he says, was when Julian began to lose consciousness</p><p>A week or so before Maike Hohnen took the fishing trip that would change his life, he drove past a building site and spotted a sign that read “Free”. Nearby, on a patch of grass, were a hundred or so plastic buckets. Instinctively, Hohnen pulled over, grabbed eight or nine of them, and threw them in the back of his pick-up truck. “When I got home I put a couple in my boat,” he says. “I thought to myself, these will come in handy one day.”</p><p>Hohnen is a keen fisherman. Well, that’s rather understating it. He started fishing commercially when he was just 14, helping out in school holidays, before turning it into a 20-year career.
