Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead Redemption might be the only franchises that Rockstar thinks about at this point in time, but as those who have played the 2011 open world masterpiece L.A. Noire will tell you, that is another Rockstar property that needs to re-enter the zeitgeist sooner rather than later. 

L.A. Noire was a stellar game, and with its revolutionary use of facial capture technology, its authentic, detailed, and incredibly atmospheric setting, its gripping narrative and accomplished storytelling, and its unique and satisfying gameplay loop, it delivered a game that stands out in the memory.

2023 has revived something no one was asking for- the grand tradition of absolutely irredeemably bad licensed games. In a year where we’ve already had a few of those, The Walking Dead: Destinies probably stands as the worst one yet- which, when you consider just how bad some of the earlier ones this year got, is really saying something. Is there anything nice to say about The Walking Dead: Destinies? 

I suppose conceptually, making a third-person shooter that follows the show and gives the player the chance to diverge from its events is an intriguing proposition, but after a point, you really need to ask yourself: is it really worth it putting up with all the cruft just for a horrifically poorly executed take on that idea? You can decide for yourself. For my money? Absolutely not.
