Due to a chain of events in the Middle East, the US military has deployed 4 carriers at the same time, slightly exceeding the original carrier deployment plan, but still within the normal state of affairs. For a long time, the U.S. military has been preparing for two and a half wars, one in Europe leading NATO to face Russia; one in the Pacific uniting allies to face the Chinese Communist Party or CCP; and a half in perhaps other hotspots.
