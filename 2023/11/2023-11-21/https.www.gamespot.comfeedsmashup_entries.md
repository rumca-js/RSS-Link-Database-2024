<p dir="ltr">Pokemon Scarlet and Violet introduced some of the most radical changes to the mainline Pokemon formula in years, most notably with a wide-open world to explore and free-roaming Pokemon to capture. For the first of its two-part expansion, The Teal Mask, you ventured away from the massive landmass of Paldea and into a new, self-contained biome--a sort of miniaturized version of the open world. Based on a brief hands-on, the second part, called The Indigo Disk, seems to echo this approach, albeit with more challenge for experienced Pokemon masters.</p><p dir="ltr">The Teal Mask introduced us to the land of Kitakami during its Festival of Masks, where we uncovered a long-buried secret about its culture while befriending two of the locals, Carmine and Kieran. Though it wrapped up its own Kitakami story, it also ended on a cliffhanger for the second half of the expansion to pick up. In Indigo Disk, you're a visiting student at Blueberry Academy, where Carmine attends school.</
