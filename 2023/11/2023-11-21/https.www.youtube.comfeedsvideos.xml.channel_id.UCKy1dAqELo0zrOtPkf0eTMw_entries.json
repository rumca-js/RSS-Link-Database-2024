Martin Provides Update on His Next Game of Thrones Book - IGN The Fix: Entertainment", "description": "The acclaimed creator of the Game of Thrones universe, George R.R. Martin, can\u2019t seem to figure out how that epic saga should end on paper, either - This could explain why The Winds of Winter, the sixth entry in his epic A Song of Ice and Fire series is now 9 - 12 years late. Martin told us back in 2012 when and where this upcoming book would take place, but now we know just how many pages he\u2019s cranked out in the first draft. But while we all wait to read what he\u2019s cooking up, Martin is still working with HBO on various adaptations. He mentions it, saying, \"In television we have the new show, House of the Dragon, which has just finished filming its second season, and we're going to be planning for the third season soon. But I also have like eight other spin-off shows that we're developing. The Dunk and Egg show has been greenlit.\u201d", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8qKQnmZCV8", "date_published": "2023-11-21T00:08:58+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "Ign - YouTube", "album": "Ign - YouTube", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/Q8qKQnmZCV8/hqdefault.jpg", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "title": "Super Mario RPG - How to Find and Fight the Secret Boss", "description": "There are secrets galore in Super Mario RPG, including the return of a very cool boss fight.
