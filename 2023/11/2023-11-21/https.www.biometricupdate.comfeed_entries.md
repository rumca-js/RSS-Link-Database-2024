		<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/zerobiometrics">ZeroBiometrics</a> has patented a method of generating reproducible cryptographic keys from biometric entropy and performing biometric authentication, both using zero-knowledge proofs.

The company emphasizes the security and privacy advantages of not storing either biometric templates or end-user’s cryptographic keys in the announcement.

The patent from the United States Patent and Trademark Organization (USPTO) protects a method that provides these benefits while meeting or exceeding the accuracy and usability level of traditional biometrics, the company says.

CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alfred-chan-18243882/">Alfred Chan</a> say ZeroBiometrics has solved multiple puzzles that have stu

		The EU's Prüm rules for exchanging data among police agencies have taken a large step toward being updated to include facial and DNA-profile biometrics.

The European Parliament and the European Council resolved their differences on the rules and now must adopt them.

As part of the update, officials will at least review confirmed biometric matches made by the new exchange system within 48 hours.

The revised regulation framework, known as Prüm II, covers automated data exchanges among police agencies in the Union, including Europol.

At the same time, officials have centralized data flows through the updated framework.

They also created EPRIS, or the European Police Records System, which will automatically exchange police records.
