If your life has been upsetting devoid of underwater terror since polishing off Subnautica: Below Zero, a glimmer of nautical promise is on the (distant) horizon, with publisher Krafton confirming the next instalment in the ocean survival series is anticipateed to arrive in the first half of 2025.
</p><p>
Official word that a new Subnautica game was on the way first surfaced in April last year, when developer Unknown Worlds - the studio behind the series' original 2018 entry and its 2021 follow-up Subnautica: Below Zero - announced it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-new-subnautica-game-is-in-early-development">was seeking a senior narrative designer</a> to "help shape the next game in the Subnautica universe".
</p><p>
And now, a little over 18 months later, the new Subnautica has made an appearance in publisher Krafton's slate

Back in September, Dave the Diver studio Mintrocket <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dave-the-diver-studios-next-game-is-a-pvpve-zombie-stealth-survival-adventure">unveiled Nakwon: Last Paradise</a>, a 16-player stealth-survival extraction game set on the streets of Seoul amid an undead apocalypse, and now - with a public pre-alpha playtest looming - it's shared 22 minutes of gameplay.
</p><p>
Nakwon is a game of two parts; the primary focus is Scouting, requiring players (either solo or in a team of two) to leave the titular safe zone in order to scavenge for resources out in the city. Being a PvPvE experience, the threats outside are twofold: there're the zombies - which can't be killed, meaning stealth is key to survival - alongside other human scavengers, who'll either need to be avoided or set upon with makeshift weaponr

## Steam now lets you know if games support PlayStation DualSense or DualShock controllers

Valve has released a fresh Steam update that makes it even simpler to discover games supported by different controllers.
</p><p>
While it has been easy to find Steam games that support Xbox controllers, Valve has now built upon this function to make finding games that support both the DualSense and its predecessor the DualShock a doddle.
</p><p>
As part of an upgraded controller-friendly hub, Steam users can explore games by controller type when browsing the vast library. It will "default" to the controller any given user played with most recently, but there is also the option to adjust the filters.

Fortnite has put a date on its next big live event - its first for a full year - now formally named as The Big Bang. 
</p><p>
This is the moment Fortnite will transition out of its current OG guise, which has seen all-time record engagement as the game's original map returned, and into something brand new.
</p><p>
The Big Bang will take place live within Fortnite on Saturday 2nd December at 7pm UK time (that's 2pm Eastern, or 11am Pacific), with online leaks suggesting a huge music star will be making a surprise in-game appearance.

Looking for something different, original and distinctive? After years available on PC, Teardown has finally appeared on the current generation consoles - and by and large, it's terrific. As an extra bonus, it's currently one of the free games on the PlayStation Plus subscription package - and I encourage you to check it out. 
</p><p>
Teardown is a fascinating game from the Digital Foundry perspective as its rendering and simulation systems are quite different from the vast majority of titles out there. Like many of the most iconic games of the last 30 years, the core tech behind Teardown is the main enabler of its gameplay systems. At the core of the game are the voxels which make up the game world. It gives the game its low-fi/hi-fi aesthetic, where each and every object in the game you see

That's according to the scrapped project's executive producer John Melchior, who revealed developer Radical Entertainment even had plans to include planes in a Hit &amp; Run sequel.

Speaking with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNt4M9VBkdo">MinnMax</a>, the producer, along with other members of the Hit &amp; Run team, discussed the tabled sequel and the various ideas the studio had for it.

And while 1970s America isn't as eye-catching as the tropical island of Call of the

Along with the much requested DLSS support for those Starfield players with compatible graphics cards, this update also covers a variety of other fixes and features across the board.

I thought I would give Snakebird Complete five minutes or so when I downloaded it. Of course, it ended up eating my entire weekend. Brilliant brain-teasy puzzles, each the size of a single thought, and those lovely flat, bright colours and that beautiful children's book world!
</p><p>
Hmm. I bet I'm about to find out that Snakebird is annoying to describe. It's sort of a puzzley, spatial-logic take on Blockade, or Snake. You play as a long, thin animal that grows every time you eat a piece of fruit. Your job is to get from the starting point on each compact, 2D level, to the exit. If there's fruit, you have to make sure you eat all of it in order to open up the exit. If there are spikes you need to avoid them. If there are drops you need to navigate them without falling. 
</p><p>
A lot of the fun comes from the rules. Snakebirds can f
