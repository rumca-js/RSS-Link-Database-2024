We&#8217;ve documented in detail how the whole AT&#38;T&#8211;>Time Warner&#8211;>Warner Brothers Discovery merger process has been a pointless mess, resulting in no limits of layoffs and damage to the underlying brands. What was supposed to be a gambit by these companies to dominate streaming TV, wound up being a very expensive act of seppuku by over-compensated [&#8230;]

If you &#8212; like Florida governor Ron DeSantis and his hateful little legislative buddies &#8212; want to oppress certain people, you&#8217;re going to have to do it on your own time. The state isn&#8217;t allowed to help you be shitty. Florida passed an anti-drag show law earlier this year. Legislators were careful to ensure the [&#8230;]

A few weeks back we wrote about a report that the EU Commission, in its push for dangerous client-side scanning mandates, had started buying highly targeted ads to try to influence people to support the policy. The ads, first revealed by Wired, were incredibly misleading. But, also, as we noted, appeared to violate EU’s privacy [&#8230;]

After years of continuous, unrepentant abuse of surveillance powers, the FBI is facing the real possibility of seeing Section 702 curtailed, if not scuttled entirely. Section 702 allows the NSA to gather foreign communications in bulk. The FBI benefits from this collection by being allowed to perform &#8220;backdoor&#8221; searches of NSA collections to obtain communications [&#8230;]

So, yesterday we covered Elon Musk’s ridiculous censorial threat to sue Media Matters “the split second the court opens on Monday.” Of course, as we noted, you can file lawsuits 24/7. And yet, as the courts opened on Monday, there was nothing. As mentioned in the original post, I was away from internet access for [&#8230;]

Case in point: [&#8230;]

The NYPD has plenty of problems with accountability and transparency. The main problem is this: the public wants some of this and the NYPD wants none of this. So, it does stupid things repeatedly that do little more than remind the public it&#8217;s not to be trusted. Like any cop shop, it&#8217;s manned by cops [&#8230;]
