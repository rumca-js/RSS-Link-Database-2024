In today's Daily Fix:
The Mortal Kombat 1 microtransaction saga continues with players finding a way to get some of the skins for free. It involves time travelling and may or may not violate WB Games' terms of service, but hey, the trick is out there if you're curious. In other news, Cyberpunk 2077 is getting an ultimate edition and if you're a fan of physical media, the Xbox Series X version will ship on a whopping 3 discs. This and Baldur's Gate 3 are the latest titles to need 3 discs' worth of space. And Square Enix thought 2 discs for Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth was a lot. And finally, an update to Lords of the Fallen addresses a lot of players' issues, specifcally when it comes to ambushes and enemy density. The update also includes a new questline, new armor, a new weapon, and some new spells.

Super Mario RPG contains many different weapons and equipment you can collect for your party, and while you’ll receive most of them from merchants in shops, there are a few extremely good weapons found in chests that can easily be missed!

The Lazy Shell is considered Mario's best weapon by far and comes in both a weapon and armor variant. They’re both hidden away in a secret location that requires you to complete a side quest. To do so, you'll need to find a seed and fertilizer, and then deliver both to the Rose Town Gardener. In this video, we’ll show you exactly how to do all of that!

With his latest bit of IMAX spectacle, Oppenheimer, hitting the streets as Blu-Ray and 4k Ultra HD discs, Christopher Nolan wants us all to know that no streaming company is going to steal them from you. As the industry continues to find its way through the age of streaming, we got to talk to Nolan about the economics of the home video market, how Best Buy is phasing out their sale of physical media, and whether or not he thinks Memento would be harder to make in the film financing landscape of today. Beyond anything else, though, he admits times are “scary for filmmakers,” when their movies can disappear from a streaming service.

Watch our Napoleon review. Napoleon, reviewed by A.A. Dowd. Narrated by Ronny Barrier.

Ridley Scott returns to the old-world battlefields and feudal intrigue of his Oscar-winning Gladiator with a decades-spanning biopic of the French tactician who conquered half of Europe. As a historical epic, Napoleon is handsome but a little impersonal – you can really feel the absence of texture lost in getting it down under three hours. But between the textbook bullet points, a very funny anti-Great Man biopic peeks through, thanks largely to Joaquin Phoenix’s performance as a Bonaparte who’s more boy than man.

## Flashback 2 Review

Flashback 2 reviewed by Tristan Ogilvie on PlayStation 5. Also available on PC and Xbox Series X|S.

"While the original Flashback is an Amiga classic, Flashback 2 can only be described as a meagre sequel. Rehashed story elements, dull and clunky combat, a shockingly modest presentation, peculiar design decisions, and wholly unacceptable technical deficiencies (the bulk of which persist even after two post-release patches) make for an adventure that left me underwhelmed at best and utterly infuriated at worst. While I’ll always feel nostalgic for Conrad Hart’s original adventure, Flashback 2 is unfortunately not the blast from the past I had hoped for – instead, it’s a total misfire."

Naruto x Boruto Ultimate Ninja Storm Connections reviewed by Charlie Wacholz on PlayStation 5 and PC, also available on Xbox Series X and Nintendo Switch.

"Naruto x Boruto Ultimate Ninja Storm Connections may have the biggest roster and flashiest graphics in the series, but its unenthusiastic re-telling of the source material in what should be a celebration of Naruto, Shippuden, and Boruto falls flat. Even when it’s fun and nostalgic, there’s almost nothing here to seek out over past entries with basically the same fighting system and better single-player stories. If all you want is the newest, biggest, and shiniest way to watch your favorite shinobi battle it out, Ninja Storm Connections at least delivers that. But just because it understands the assignment doesn’t mean its execution gets high marks."

In today's Daily Fix:
A reported leak of a database file for Grand Theft Auto 5 may contain evidence of scrapped story DLC for the game. The leak also points to a sequel to the cult hit, Bully, which never saw the light of day. This comes just weeks before the first look at the highly-anticipated Grand Theft Auto 6. In other news, a bunch of unannounced Gearbox Software titles popped up in a now-deleted LinkedIn post. The list includes Borderlands 4, Tiny Tina's Wonderlands 2, and a new Brothers in Arms game. And finally, that awful King Kong game might not be the most-roasted videogame of the year. The Walking Dead: Destinies is apparently as bad (if not worse), and, get this: it's from the same publisher. Sensing a pattern yet?

The acclaimed creator of the Game of Thrones universe, George R.R. Martin, can’t seem to figure out how that epic saga should end on paper, either - This could explain why The Winds of Winter, the sixth entry in his epic A Song of Ice and Fire series is now 9 - 12 years late. Martin told us back in 2012 when and where this upcoming book would take place, but now we know just how many pages he’s cranked out in the first draft. But while we all wait to read what he’s cooking up, Martin is still working with HBO on various adaptations. He mentions it, saying, "In television we have the new show, House of the Dragon, which has just finished filming its second season, and we're going to be planning for the third season soon. But I also have like eight other spin-off shows that we're developing. The Dunk and Egg show has been greenlit.”
