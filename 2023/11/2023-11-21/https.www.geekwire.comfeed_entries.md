Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, appearing inside the courthouse at 7th Avenue and Stewart Street, pleaded guilty to a range of securities law violations that prosecutors said enabled money laundering, terrorist financing, and other illegal activities on the cryptocurrency exchange, allegedly evading federal law for nearly four years. Zhao avoided reporters and photographers as he left the courthouse, walking down a side stairway to a waiting vehicle.&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/binance-ceo-pleads-guilty-in-seattle-as-federal-prosecutors-secure-landmark-4-3b-crypto-p

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella made it clear in interviews Monday that the company wouldn&#8217;t be opposed to Altman returning to OpenAI, with changes to the board, including provisions to keep Microsoft from being surprised in the manner it was on Friday, learning of Altman&#8217;s ouster minutes before the rest of the world. &#8220;One thing, I&#8217;ll be very, very clear, is we&#8217;re&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/satya-nadella-microsoft-will-never-again-get-blindsided-by-openai-board-if-sam-altman-returns/">Read More</a>
