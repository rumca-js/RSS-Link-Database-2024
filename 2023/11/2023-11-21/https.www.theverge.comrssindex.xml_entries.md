  <p id="P3MKyQ">Insta360’s new action cameras borrow the blocky design of GoPro’s popular Hero series but add the ability to flip up that large 2.4-inch rear touchscreen for easy vlogging. The company’s new “Ace” camera starts at $379.99 for the regular model, and there’s a flagship “Pro” version for $449.99. The higher-end one is equipped with a Leica Summarit lens and a large 1/1.3-inch image sensor for excellent low-light performance and up to 8K at 24 frames per second recording. Both versions are available now.</p>
