</p><p>
As with last year, Pok&eacute;mon Go Tour will also have an in-person option, this time held in Los Angeles over 17th and 18th February. 
</p><p>
Tour events typically feature all Pok&eacute;mon found in a specific region from the main series Pok&eacute;mon games, and in this case it's Diamond and Pearl's Sinnoh.

The PlayStation Plus Monthly Games lineup has been revealed for December, ending the year on a high.
</p><p>
Squirt 'em up PowerWash Simulator leads the charge, after launching on Game Pass last year. It lets players powerwash vehicles, houses, parks and more, alone and in co-op. It's a particularly chilled experience, though hopefully the free Tomb Raider and Final Fantasy 7 DLC packs will be included. The SpongeBob Squarepants and most recent Back to the Future DLCs are paid extras.
</p><p>
Also included is Sable, a sparse adventure game with a unique, line-drawn art style and music from Japanese Breakfast. Donlan described it as a "mesmerising game of exploration" in our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sable-review-sparseness-and-beauty">Eurogamer Sable review</a>.

The early results have been mixed, with some titles exhibiting UE5's merits convincingly while others have been bogged down by image quality or performance problems. Yet there's one question that hasn't been answered quite as well: how well do these technologies scale to console systems? Today we're looking at the current state of Unreal Engine 5 on PS5, Series X and Series S to evaluate how the technology fares in early game efforts. </p><p>The key takeaway from my experiences with Unreal Engine 5 so far is that the core feature set works. Lumen global illumination (GI) solves indirect lighting in real time to a high degree of fidelity, producing great-looking shading in most circums

Sega has admitted releasing Sonic Superstars at the same time as Super Mario Bros. Wonder and Marvel's Spider-Man 2 may have hindered sales.
</p><p>
In a presentation of the company's recent financial quarterly report, sales of its mascot platformer were described as having a "slightly weaker start than we had anticipated".
</p><p>
Then, in a newly released Q&amp;A following its recent financial report, president and group CEO Haruki Satomi and senior executive vice president and CFO Koichi Fukazawa were asked for the reason for the lower-than-expected sales so far.

Ubisoft is still to officially confirm the Beyond Good &amp; Evil 20th Anniversary Edition, but people are now playing the game after an apparent slip-up saw it briefly available via subscription service Ubisoft+.
</p><p>
Screenshots and gameplay footage have now hit the internet, and show a scrubbed up version of the classic adventure game that players say is now playable in 4K.
</p><p>
Eurogamer was able to view 30 minutes of gameplay footage this morning via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVtxy7SQ1GU">YouTube</a>, though this has now been taken down by Ubisoft through a copyright claim.

The suit worn by a certain Robert Pattinson - or Battinson, if you will allow me - in Warner Bros' The Batman film will be available as part of the Arkham Trilogy on Nintendo Switch. 
</p><p>
We briefly got a look at this particular batsuit last month, when players noticed it cropping up prematurely in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/robert-pattinsons-batsuit-briefly-appears-in-the-8-year-old-batman-arkham-knight">2015's Batman: Arkham Knight</a>. 
</p><p>
Now, however, the suit is officially set to be part of the games. It will be a timed-exclusive suit launching with the Batman: Arkham Trilogy on Switch.
