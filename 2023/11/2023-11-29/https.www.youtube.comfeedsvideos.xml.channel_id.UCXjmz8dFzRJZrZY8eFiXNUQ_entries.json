Though Oppenheimer and the Wind Rises were released almost 10 years apart, the themes of war, obsession, and consequence run through both films.  Christopher Nolans Oppenheimer is a story about a man driven to create an instrument of war that forever reshapes the globe, while Miyazaki's The Wind Rises is also about a man driven to create an instrument of war that forever reshapes the globe.  Though both films look at different perspectives, one thing remains true to both....the theme of obsession.\n\n#christophernolan #oppenheimer #miyazaki #nerdstalgic \n\nSources: \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wind_Rises \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oppenheimer_(film)", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zL34JpZGH9o", "date_published": "2023-11-29T18:00:38+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "Nerdstalgic", "album": "Nerdstalgic", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/zL34JpZGH9o/hqdefault.jpg", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}]
