Our good old friend Keith from the small tech shop we bought out told us this Panasonic Toughbook laptop was indestructible. We don’t think so much. But just how much damage can it take? What ARE the standards for deeming a computer as “rugged”? Was Keith overselling it or does this PC have an adamantium chassis and the ability to regenerate?
