Researchers are increasingly realizing, however, that the 'little brain' or cerebellum also expanded during evolution and probably contributes to the capacities unique to humans. A research team has now generated comprehensive genetic maps of the development of cells in the cerebella of human, mouse and opossum. Comparisons of these maps reveal both ancestral and species-specific cellular and molecular characteristics of cerebellum development.", "link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2023/11/231129112348.htm", "date_published": "2023-11-29T11:23:48+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "Latest Science News -- ScienceDaily", "album": "Latest Science News -- ScienceDaily", "user": null, "language": "en-us", "thumbnail": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/scidaily-logo-rss.png", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/rss/all.xml", "title": "Eye-safe laser technology to diagnose traumatic brain injury", "description": "Researchers have designed and developed a novel diagnostic device to detect traumatic brain injury (TBI) by shining a safe laser into the eye.", "link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2023/11/231129112303.htm", "date_published": "2023-11-29T11:23:03+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "Latest Science News -- ScienceDaily", "album": "Latest Science News -- ScienceDaily", "user": null, "language": "en-us", "thumbnail": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/scidaily-logo-rss.png", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/rss/all.xml", "title": "To build better tuberculosis vaccines, researchers develop new model by leveraging an old vaccine", "description": "Scientists\u00a0report a promising new approach to speed vaccine testing for TB.", "link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2023/11/231129111954.htm", "date_published": "2023-11-29T11:19:54+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "Latest Science News -- ScienceDaily", "album": "Latest Science News -- ScienceDaily", "user": null, "language": "en-us", "thumbnail": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/scidaily-logo-rss.png", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/rss/all.xml", "title": "Newborn babies at risk from bacteria commonly carried by mothers", "description": "One in 200 newborns is admitted to a neonatal unit with sepsis caused by a bacteria commonly carried by their mothers -- much greater than the previous estimate, say researchers.
