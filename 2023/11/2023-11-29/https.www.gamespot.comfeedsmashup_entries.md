These raid-like three-player activities are among the toughest and most intricate in the game, but they don't require the six-player squads of Destiny 2's raids. The new dungeon is called Warlord's Ruin, and it's set to release on December 1, the first Friday of the new season.</p><p dir="ltr">Details are sparse on Warlord's Ruin, but we do know a few things, including when it'll be available and some of what you can earn from it.

<p dir="ltr">If you want a powerful, easy-to-use gun to bring into <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/">Destiny 2</a>'s PvP arena, the Crucible, it's hard to go wrong with Thorn. The hand cannon is great because it hits hard and poisons opponents, dealing damage over time. It's even better this season, thanks to a new Exotic catalyst you can earn for the gun that boosts its stats and capabilities. However, you'll have to find the catalyst in order to unlock it and make the most of Thorn.</p><p dir="ltr">Here's everything you need to know about Thorn's Exotic catalyst, how to get it, and what benefits it rewards once you do.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How to get the Thorn Exotic catalyst</h2><p dir="ltr">Like many other Exotic catalysts, Thorn's catalyst isn't one you can earn through a quest or mission--instead, it comes as a random drop from playing the game. <strong>You can earn it from Ritual activities: Strikes, Gambit matches, or Crucible matches</strong>.</p><a href="https

<p>In 2015, Microsoft stopped announcing Xbox sales numbers, and now the company has shed more light on that decision. Xbox CFO Tim Stuart said at the <a href="https://event.webcasts.com/viewer/event.jsp?ei=1643204&amp;tp_key=6a9bad458f">Wells Fargo 2023 TMT Summit</a> this week that Microsoft doesn't publicly discloses these figures because, as Microsoft sees it, a unit-sales number alone doesn't provide the clearest picture of how the Xbox brand is performing overall.</p><p>For what it's worth, both Sony and Nintendo announce new hardware sales numbers every quarter. Xbox is understood to be in last place when it comes to console sales compared to PlayStation and Switch, and that might be another reason for Microsoft's lack of console sales disclosure.</p><p>Stuart said at the summit, "At first it was like, 'What are you doing?' 'You're the Xbox business and you're not giving us console [sales numbers], that makes no sense.' But it was really the first point of us saying, no, no, i

That makes sense; it is, after all, a nearly 20-year-old game.</p><p dir="ltr">Though the original version of WoW that launched in 2004 was in many ways overwritten with subsequent updates, mostly notably 2010's Cataclysm expansion, players never stopped playing the "vanilla" version of Blizzard's MMORPG thanks to unofficial private servers that were available prior to Blizzard's official re-release of the original WoW in 2019. In that time, everything there was to learn about the original era of WoW had been exhaustively detailed.

After all, Cobra Kai is about teenagers learning karate, adults coming to terms with the misdeeds of their youth, and plenty of '80s nostalgia. Obliterated, on the other hand, is filled with sex, drugs, alcohol, explosions, psychedelic trips, and the threat of a nuclear apocalypse.
