Christopher Nolan and Hayao Miyazaki are two filmmakers that work under the unifying theme of obsession.  Though Oppenheimer and the Wind Rises were released almost 10 years apart, the themes of war, obsession, and consequence run through both films.  Christopher Nolans Oppenheimer is a story about a man driven to create an instrument of war that forever reshapes the globe, while Miyazaki's The Wind Rises is also about a man driven to create an instrument of war that forever reshapes the globe.  Though both films look at different perspectives, one thing remains true to both....the theme of obsession.
