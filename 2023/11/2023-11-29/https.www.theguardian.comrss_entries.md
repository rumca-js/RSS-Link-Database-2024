<p>Mikel Arteta could hardly have dreamed of a smoother return to Champions League football. Arsenal are through to the last 16 and, although the spring will surely offer stiffer tests than a weak Group B that they have won with a game to spare, a run to the latter stages will be distinctly possible should they remain this clinical.</p><p>Lens were dispatched brutally with five first-half goals, Kai Havertz starting the rout before Gabriel Jesus, Bukayo Saka, Gabriel Martinelli and Martin Ødegaard all joined in. Almost everything they hit went in, allowing the well-deserved luxury of a somnolent second half enlivened by Jorginho’s late VAR-awarded penalty.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/nov/29/arsenal-lens-champions-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Loyalty schemes are listing more and more products at cheaper prices for cardholders, but many shoppers are missing out</p><p>One of the occasional oddities of modern supermarket shopping is being asked by a fellow customer – not a checkout assistant – whether one has a Clubcard, Nectar card or whatever. The cardless shopper understandably wants the lower prices that usually come with tapping the relevant piece of plastic. Since the card-equipped shopper can gain a few loyalty points for free, a mutually beneficial arrangement is easily agreed. But the process feels silly. Why are supermarkets creating these hassles?</p><p>Welcome, of course, to the age of retail-data collection. The punishment for not having a loyalty card that will record your shopping habits can be a meaningfully higher price at the till. Loyalty schemes aren’t new, but substantially stiffer prices are.

<p>‘These bouts had cash prizes and offered a way for insecure young people to feel good about themselves using the only thing they had: their bodies’</p><p>I was born near Paris but grew up on Nosy Be, a small island off the northwest coast of Madagascar. My mother is Malagasy and British, my father is Italian, and I had a relatively privileged middle-class childhood. Partly because of that, and partly because I don’t look like a Malagasy person, I always felt a sense of disconnection. Madagascar is of course a former French colony, and I went to a French-speaking school. By age 10, I’d lost the Malagasy language, despite having spoken it fluently when I was younger.</p><p>My sense of not belonging only deepened when I moved to France to study in 2009. But in photography I found a way to start exploring my feelings about Madagascar and a way to reconnect. When I want back to visit my family one summer, all my friends were talking about this martial art, <a href="https://en.wikipedia

<p>To escape this bloody impasse, Israel must declare it seeks a settlement with a willing Palestinian leadership and take steps to end occupation</p><p>Like many other people in Israel and across the world, my first reaction to the attack on 7 October was of shock and horror. But that initial reaction was accompanied by rage, not only at the appalling massacre perpetrated by Hamas on women and children, the elderly and the handicapped, even babies, but also at those who could have prevented this act of violence, many that preceded it and the brutal retaliation that would come in its wake.</p><p>Without clearly defined political goals, war tends to devolve into endless destruction and annihilation. The only way out of this conundrum is for Israel to declare that it seeks a peaceful resolution of the conflict with an appropriate and willing Palestinian leadership.

<p>In his book Among the Bros, Max Marshall shines a light on a case in Charleston and what it says about Greek life in America</p><p>In June of 2016, the police chief in Charleston, South Carolina, held a press conference. Eight men between the ages of 19 and 25 had been arrested in one of the largest drug busts in the city’s history. The arrests came as a result of an investigation into the murder of Patrick Moffly, a 23-year-old former student and son of a luxury real estate developer who had been shot in the chest a few months prior. Authorities had confiscated not only drugs but seven firearms, a grenade launcher and over $200,000 in cash from a small stash house the young men rented.</p><p>Watching this on television was Max Marshall, an investigative journalist. He was intrigued. The suspects looked familiar – not because he knew them personally, but because of their swoopy haircuts.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/nov/29/among-the-bros-fraternity-max-marsh

<p>An account of the teenage Mozart’s operatic awakening is packed with humanising detail</p><p>Of all the stories that are told about Wolfgang Mozart’s visits to Italy, one exceeds all others in fame. It concerns the day in Rome in April 1770 when the 14-year-old Mozart first heard Gregorio Allegri’s Miserere, an unaccompanied nine-part polyphonic setting of a psalm that normally lasts about 13 minutes. The Miserere rises repeatedly to an ethereal top C, a haunting moment that had already given the work Europe-wide mystique in Mozart’s time and ensures that it is still widely performed and recorded today.</p><p>The Miserere had been written in the 1630s for the exclusive use of the Sistine Chapel choir and for performance only during Holy Week. The score was a ferociously guarded Vatican secret. No written versions were supposed to exist. Yet, in the chapel that day, young Mozart listened to the Miserere once, then went home to his lodgings and wrote the entire thing down from memor

A week after I moved in, in December 2021, I reported moisture gathering on the kitchen ceiling.

It was a plumber, hired by me, who discovered a nail in a bathroom pipe, which had flooded the subflooring.

But when it’s bad it’s … well, the original poem by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow says “horrid,” but Bad Behaviour is more very awkward and self-indulgent. But the good largely outweighs the “oof” and this is a first feature for writer-director-co-star Alice Englert who should be applauded for taking interesting if not always successful risks.</p><p>At least Englert made a safe bet by casting Jennifer Connelly in the lead, for one of her best roles for many years.
