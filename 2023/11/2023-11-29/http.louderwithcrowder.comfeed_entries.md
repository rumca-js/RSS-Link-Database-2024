The good news is that you saved $3 this <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/thanksgiving-meal-prices" target="_blank">Thanksgiving </a>compared to last year. The bad news is that you are still short about $11,401 from last year. </p><p>Biden’s economy is so bad that the White House has to analyze and cherry-pick millions of data sets just to claim that your Thanksgiving dinner cost several dollars less this year. But because math is racist, the left does not know how to do basic equations. </p><p>This is Biden's math for you: Increase prices by 200 percent and lower them by 3 percent. This is what they consider “cheaper”. </p><p><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/inflation-households-need-extra-11400-these-states-its-even-higher/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CBS </a>ran

Governor Gretchen Whitmer was one of those people who was exposed as she was part of the bandwagon of several governors who grossly overstepped their authority by issuing draconian lockdown orders upon their constituents. Whitmer followed the "science" then, and she is following the "science" now. And by "science," they mean political science. </p><p>Whitmer signed three proposed energy bills Tuesday, making Michigan a “national leader” on the most strict energy mandates in the nation. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

I would have too much self-respect for myself and the intelligence of my constituents to say these things. Johnson doesn't have that problem.</p><p>At issue is the migrant crisis.
