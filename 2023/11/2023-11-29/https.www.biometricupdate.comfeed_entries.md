		The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), the nation’s digital identity competition regulator, is issuing  a limited tender to build the platform that will house its national <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202311/modest-transparency-on-australias-digital-id-plans-and-even-less-from-nsw">digital ID system</a>. It has invited just 5 to 10 vendors to submit a request for quote on the platform, and refuses to share if any local suppliers are among them or how much the project will cost, according to <a href="https://www.innovationaus.com/competition-regulator-limits-competition-on-digital-id-tender/">InnovationAus</a>.

		Clearly appreciating that it was selling digital authentication to data-security officials in the inertia-guided U.S. federal bureaucracy, a <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/fido-alliance">FIDO Alliance</a> panel speaking in a webinar spent a lot of time telling them not to panic.

New anti-phishing procedures are on the way, the panel said, but they come with practical levels of flexibility and don't require replacing time-honored personal ID verification (PIV) credentials and common access cards.

The alliance members, in an accompanying <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/white-paper-fido-alliance-guidance-for-u-s-government-agency-deployment-of-fido-authentication/">white paper</a>, stipulated that implementing single sign-on, life-cycle management

		Passwordless authentication methods such as biometric and PIN-based logins are gaining ground, according to research and the latest moves from companies such as Accenture.

The consulting firm has spent the last three years transitioning more than 600,000 employees to passwordless methods, <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/11/28/how-accenture-got-rid-of-passwords">according</a> to Axios. The move was prompted by the friction that comes with  traditional passwords. Accenture used to require that employees reset their passwords every 75 days.  The result was so many employees forgetting them that the company had to dedicate n some of its IT team just to resetting passwords.

With the help of Microsoft, the company rolled out passwordless login th

		Amid rising global interest in online age verification, Australia’s politicians are indulging in a bit of gamesmanship, with the coalition Opposition pushing the Albanese government to test age assurance technology, including biometric identification, face verification and digital ID tokens – or daring it to vote against a measure that protects minors.

A report from <a href="https://www.innovationaus.com/opposition-targets-social-media-alcohol-with-age-assurance-tech/">InnovationAus.com</a> says that the <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202103/australias-online-safety-act-could-bring-in-biometric-age-checks-for-online-pornography">Online Safety Amendment</a> (Protecting Australian Children from Online Harm) Bill 2023 introduced by the Opposition

		The Spanish Data Protection Agency (AEPD) has published a guide outlining how biometric data should be used for access control, according to an announcement translated from Spanish using Google Translate.

The document outlines criteria for the use of biometrics both inside and outside of the workplace. The document's criteria complies with the <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202305/gdpr-5-years-on-spain-ireland-lead-in-issuing-fines-meta-hit-hardest">GDPR</a> and other regulatory frameworks.

The agency describes the processing of biometric data as high-risk and finds it necessary to establish a guide for its use as it grows progressively easier to gather larger volumes of biometric data, sometimes without their knowledge.

		Keyless is spinning out from Sift, two years after being acquired by the fraud management provider, and has also raised $6 million in venture capital funding.

The separation from Sift is described as a strategic decision, based on the recognition that the two companies’ technologies are best suited to serve different markets, according to the announcement. Keyless’ passwordless biometric multi-factor authentication was integrated into Sift’s <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202204/sift-folds-in-keyless-biometric-mfa-to-its-platform-following-acquisition">Connect App Gallery</a> last year.

		Europe has a plan to prevent terrorist attacks on public transportation with video analytics algorithms, possibly but not necessarily including facial recognition. The project named PREVENT PCP is soon entering its final stage.

The European Union-funded plan is tasked with increasing security in train and subway stations as well as surrounding public areas. It includes identification and tracking of perpetrators and unattended items and an advanced crisis management system. A total of 34 bidders participated in the PREVENT PCP <a href="https://prevent-pcp.eu/wp-content/uploads/TD-1-PREVENT-PCP-CALL-FOR-TENDERS.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">tender competition</a> with eight advancing to phase one and only four participating in phase two.

		A UK yearling startup says it has put a fused voice and face biometric algorithm in the field, in banks.

FARx's code has been embedded in banking systems to authenticate the identity of people purporting to be employees. It also markets its software to retail, health care, education, gaming and government buyers.

Using machine learning and AI, the software, called 1, is trained to differentiate faces and voices.

The <a href="https://www.farx.co.uk/">voice and face recognition company</a> was founded by Clive Summerfield, once the chief technology officer and founder of <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/auraya-systems-pty-ltd">Auraya</a> and a managing director at <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/lumenvox">LumenVox</a>

		An ongoing process which started on November 12 to deactivate SIM cards not biometrically registered in Uganda has seen over 1.4 million lines affected as the country’s Communication Commission (UCC) has vowed a clean sweep.

Per <a href="https://www.newvision.co.ug/category/news/uganda-telecom-regulator-disconnects-14-milli-NV_175599">a report</a> by New Vision, the move is in line with the Interception of Communications Act which requires that all SIM cards be linked to their owners’ national identification number (NIN). The legislation also mandates telecoms service providers to collect and keep personal identity and business information of all their SIM card subscribers.

		China is cracking down on the illegal trade in children’s birth certificates, which according to the country’s top health regulator are being bought, sold and forged at hospitals across the country. Caixin Global <a href="https://www.caixinglobal.com/2023-11-24/china-vows-crackdown-as-child-trafficking-helps-drive-birth-certificate-sales-102139255.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">reports</a> that the National health Commission (NHC) has deployed teams to Hubei, Guangdong, Guangxi and other provinces to “urge and guide local governments to thoroughly investigate” illegal birth certificate networks, according to a statement published on November 17.
