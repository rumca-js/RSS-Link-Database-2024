## Lethal Company Early Access Review

Lethal Company reviewed in Early Access by Gabriel Moss on PC.

There’s nothing quite like a multiplayer survival-horror game that’s as unceasingly spooky as it is hilariously chaotic – and there are few that manage to balance horror and comedy as well as Lethal Company. Even in its early access phase, this co-op loot hunt manages to transcend its limited content and missing systems, making it a good time for those willing to brave its haunted halls – especially with the volume turned up. Still, there’s no real story to speak of, and its tension is deflated a bit by an unappealing and jankily animated art style, overused dungeon templates, and an unrealized progression system that feels as cold and lifeless as the void. We can expect to see a lot of that get improved on during early access, of course.

In today's Daily Fix:
Bethesda has taken a proactive stance with regards to engaging with gamers over Starfield. Representatives of the developer have been responding to negative Steam user reviews—an unusual step for a Triple-A developer. So far, the game is Bethesda's lowest-rated offering on Steam, with a 'mixed' user review score. In other big RPG news, CD Projekt Red has reportedly committed nearly half of their staff to The Witcher 4, codenamed 'Polaris.' No release date yet, and the last official news from CDPR was from May of 2022, so this game is still years away. And finally, nostalgic gamers are retiring their Skyrim characters. On Reddit, gamers have been sharing screenshots and stories of the characters they used in their original Skyrim saves, with many giving them proper farewells as they finally put away the 12-year-old game.
