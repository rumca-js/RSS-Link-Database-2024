Microsoft&rsquo;s updated Xbox app acknowledges this, with a new compact mode that&rsquo;s suited to smaller screens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Portable consoles like the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/617378/everything-you-ever-wanted-to-know-about-the-steam-deck.html\">Valve Steam Deck</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/2045815/lenovos-take-on-the-steam-deck-has-switch-controllers-that-are-also-a-gaming-mouse.html\">Lenovo Legion GO</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1951380/asus-rog-ally-review-2.html\">ROG Ally</a> allow PC games to be taken on the go, but the smaller screens can play havoc with traditional UI elements, often forcing  gamers to navigate through tiny menus and squint-to-read text. </p>\n\n", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/2158005/microsofts-xbox-app-update-tips-its-cap-to-portable-gaming-with-new-mode.html", "date_published": "2023-11-29T17:56:16+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "PC world", "album": "PC world", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null, "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "The immortal Windows XP wallpaper is now an \u2018ugly\u2019 sweater", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. And, according to my peepers, Windows has never had a better aesthetic combination than the blue taskbar, green Start button, and gentle rolling hills of the Windows XP default wallpaper. Granted, that might just be nostalgia for a time when I didn&rsquo;t have a mortgage and sciatica.
