It doesn't completely overhaul the base game, with some issues - like odd dinosaur pathfinding AI and average combat - still present. That's before discussing the remake's technical state on PC.

Nevertheless, Ark: Survival Ascended builds upon the original in several ways while presenting a fun, somewhat grindy, but altogether massive experience.
