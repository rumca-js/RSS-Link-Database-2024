Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, is facing lawsuits from parents accusing it of not doing enough to protect teens on social media.

It proposes that parents should approve their teen's app downloads and supports legislation requiring app stores to obtain parental approval for downloads by teens under 16. Meta also wants Apple and Google to verify a teen's age on their app stores, reducing the need for age verification across multiple apps. This shifts some responsibility to other parties, including parents.

## Does applying for a loan with multiple banks hurt your credit score?

When applying for loans with multiple banks, it does affect your credit score. Banks run credit inquiries to check your credit score and report, and each inquiry lowers your score. There are two types of inquiries: hard and soft. Hard inquiries, which involve obtaining your credit report, can stay on your report for over two years. Soft inquiries, on the other hand, don't affect your score. Applying for loans can initially lower your score, but making timely payments can help build a good credit report. Applying to multiple banks within a short period can temporarily improve your score, but doing so outside of this window may raise concerns for lenders.

A blue whale calf was found beached at Ganpatipule in Ratnagiri on Monday morning. A rescue operation involving the Navy and the Coast Guard was mounted, and the calf was successfully put back into the sea. However, the calf was found dead on Wednesday evening. Marine experts say whales usually die within a few hours if they are out of water. The reasons for a whale to drift could vary, including tidal dynamics, illness, or sonar interference from submarines. The carcass is expected to wash ashore during the next high tide.
