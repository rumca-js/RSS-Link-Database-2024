The news sent shares of other car dealers down amid questions about Amazon&#8217;s strategy and ambition as it enters a huge and competitive market. Tom Voelk, an automotive writer and host of the YouTube channel Driven, said the move &#8220;just makes sense.&#8221; &#8220;It&#8217;s what the consumer wants, right?&#8221; he said, speaking to GeekWire from the Seattle International Auto Show floor on Thursday. &#8220;They want an easy experience.

During venture capital boom times in the midst of the pandemic, Seattle birthed a number of &#8220;unicorns,&#8221; a term defined a decade ago to describe tech startups valued at $1 billion or more. In 2021 alone, nine new unicorns were minted in the Seattle region. But with venture capitalists tightening their belts and an overall funding slowdown, not a single Seattle startup this year earned a unicorn moniker, according to GeekWire&#8217;s reporting and PitchBook data. There were 16 unicorns in the Seattle area as of January 2022.

Allen Family Foundation is giving another $10 million to support arts and culture in Washington state, building on a gift of the same amount last year that ultimately benefitted 671 organizations. In partnership with ArtsFund, a Seattle-based nonprofit that supports the arts through leadership, advocacy, and grant making, the 2024 Community Accelerator Grant program will again seek applicants across Washington that can use unrestricted funding for a variety of needs. Grants in the first round ranged from $2,500 to $25,000, with an average grant size of $14,909 and impacted organizations in 35 of Washington’s 39 counties.

Gage, a nearly 35-year-old nonprofit, currently occupies space in the St. Nicholas Building next to St. Mark&#8217;s Cathedral. The school will move to a 14,000-square-foot custom-built space in Amazon&#8217;s 37-story re:Invent building next summer. Amazon will provide Gage with more than $7.5 million in rent assistance over the next 10 years, and offset a significant portion of the&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/amazon-is-helping-a-longtime-seattle-art-school-move-into-modern-space-at-base-of-hq-building/">Read More</a>

But there are also plenty of health- and disease-related issues that no one has been enticed to solve with an artificial intelligence algorithm. Or there&#8217;s a bunch of models tackling the same problem and it&#8217;s unclear which one works best. Biomedical challenges can help.
