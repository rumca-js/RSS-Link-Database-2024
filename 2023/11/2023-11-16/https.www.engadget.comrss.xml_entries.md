<p>Epic has introduced a new tool for documenting toxic behavior in <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/introducing-voice-reporting-in-fortnite"><em>Fortnite</em></a>. Players will now have access to voice reporting, which will continuously record voice chats in 5-minute segments for players to submit as evidence to moderators when reporting bullying and other forms of harassment. For anyone under the age of 18, this feature will automatically be turned on.</p>
<p><em>Fortnite</em> players who are over 18 will have a bit more say over how voice reporting is applied. In the game’s main settings, they’ll have the option to set it as “Always On,” which would apply to every channel they’re in, or “Off When Possible,” which would disable it in Party Channels with friends as long as everyone’s preferences match.</p>

<p>"Black Friday" has really become a misnomer in recent years. What was once one day with truly limited-time offers has expanded into a month-long sales marathon that can feel more exhausting than exciting.

<p>The living room is where most people spend a good chunk of their time when they want to relax, but most people’s home theater setup could use a little TLC.

Here are some of the best home theater gifts for this year, and no, not all of them cost a fortune.</p>

<p>The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is keeping a close eye on internet providers to make sure they provide Americans with equal access to broadband services regardless of customers' "income level, race, ethnicity, color, religion or national origin." Two years after the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/internet-for-all-program-launch-us-broadband-digital-divide-174215299.html">Bipartisan Infrastructure Law</a> became official, the FCC has <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-398477A1.pdf">adopted</a> (PDF) a final set of relevant rules to enforce.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Commission will have the power to investigate possible instances of "digital discrimination" under the new rules and could penalize providers for violating them. It could, for instance, look into a company's pricing, network upgrades and maintenance procedures to decide whether a provider is keeping an affluent area well-maintained while failing to provide the same level of service to a low-incom

<p>Tags are a key way to seek out content on social media, but so far they've been missing on Meta's fledgling <a href="https://www.engadget.com/metas-threads-app-is-here-to-challenge-twitter-230039730.html">Threads</a> platform. That's changing soon, however, as the feature is now in testing on Threads in Australia &quot;with more countries coming soon,&quot; Mark Zuckerberg wrote in a <a href="https://www.threads.net/@zuck/post/Czrr520PZfh">new thread</a>.</p>
<p>You create a tag in the usual way by placing a hash before a word, which then displays in blue text without the hash — much as mentions work in Facebook. To seek out topics, type a hash plus a keyword into the search field to see a list of relevant posts, as one does on Instagram. So far, it's limited to a single tag per post, likely to discourage hashtag spamming — though that may change, as Meta said the feature is still a work in progress.</p>

<p>Workers at Sega of America are accusing the video game company of &quot;bad faith bargaining with workers&quot; for its plan to lay off dozens of temporary workers. The publisher known for franchises that include Sonic the Hedgehog and Yakuza is now facing an unfair labor practice complaint filed by the Communications Workers of America (CWA). In April, 200 people in various departments across the company overwhelmingly <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sega-of-america-workers-overwhelmingly-vote-to-unionize-192839100.html">voted in favor</a> of unionization and formed the Allied Employees Guild Improving Sega (AEGIS-CWA) under the CWA. Now, Sega allegedly intends to lay off 80 of those unionized workers.</p>
<p>In its complaint, the CWA explained that it's been in bargaining with Sega since September. On November 6, Sega apparently presented the organization with a proposal to phase out of all its temporary employees by taking their work offshore to the company's offices in Europ
