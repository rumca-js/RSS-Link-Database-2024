I am not even going to pretend to know the first thing about 3D printing, other than it’s pretty cool.</p> <p>My girlfriend is finishing up her undergrad in Aerospace Engineering, and from what I understand, is pretty good with 3D modeling, CAD, and all that other stuff. She has used the school’s 3D printers in the past, and I KNOW she would be thrilled to have her own. I’d like to get her one for our office as a graduation gift, and am looking for recommendations.</p> <p>Note: She is a car girl. She has done custom fiberglass work and has mentioned having an interest in designing small car parts and components.</p> <p>I appreciate anyone’s input. Again, I don’t know much about 3D printing, but wanted better advice than a simple Google search might provide.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ErikBorg1"> /u/ErikBorg1 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comme
