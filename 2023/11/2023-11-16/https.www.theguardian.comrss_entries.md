So why does the actor get so self-conscious?</p><p>Rosamund Pike is jolly when she appears on my laptop screen in a cream-coloured blouse, with a cream jacket draped around her shoulders.

<p>Dakota Johnson’s clairvoyant recites meme-worthy lines in the first look at a film that must be playing one big joke on all of us</p><p>It might be time to reassess Sony’s Spider-Man Universe. The universe, as you will be aware, exists thanks to the deal that Sony made with Marvel to get Spider-Man back into the MCU. Basically, the deal means that Marvel can make Spider-Man movies for Sony, and Sony can make Spider-Man movies for Sony, but none of Sony’s Spider-Man films can have Spider-Man in them. Makes sense, right?</p><p>When it was first announced, it may have seemed like Sony had caught the raw end of the bargain. Constructing an entire cinematic universe around bit parts and cameos, while being contractually forbidden from using the gravitational force that helped keep them interesting, sounded like a fool’s errand. Watching something like Venom (in which a key Spider-Man villain just sort of wandered around wondering what to do without Spider-Man) felt like the logical end

Is there a catch?</p><p>The idea of a guaranteed income for all has been floating around for centuries, its popularity ebbing and flowing with the passing tide of current events. While it is still considered by many to be a radical concept, proponents of a universal basic income (UBI) no longer see it only as a solution to poverty but as the answer to some of the biggest threats faced by modern workers: wage inequality, job insecurity – and the looming possibility of AI-induced job losses.</p><p>Elon Musk, at the recent Bletchley Park summit, said he believed “no job is needed” due to the development of AI, and that a job can be for “personal satisfaction”.

As I study their culture, via social media and podcasts by gay people, I find that I generally have more in common with gorillas than I do with famous people. However, I’ve noticed there is an area that levels the playing field somewhat. There’s one thing that all humans kind of suck at: Apologising.

Either way, the ball evades the fielder’s grasp and then waits nearby like an obedient dog or scuttles off into the distance.</p><p>Once any physical pain begins to subside, there are other matters to deal with – the cross looks from the bowler, the smirks from teammates, the worry that the ball will mockingly come your way again and prove similarly elusive.

<p>As the crisis in Gaza and Israel unfolds, we hunger for grand statements and moral clarity.  But all I really feel is despair</p><p>About 35 years ago I came up with a line which encouraged me to think I might be able to hack it as a writer. The line was: “I am a Jew by food; I worship at my mother’s fridge.” It wasn’t exactly Shakespeare, but it was tight and funny and most of all, it was true. As an atheist with no time for ritual or observance, who nevertheless was committed to his cultural Jewish identity, it did the job. Or at least it did the job until hate sprung eternal, for there is nothing better calculated to make you feel Jewish than overt antisemitism.</p><p>It came at me courtesy of a section of Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour party. Of course, it was countered with claims that antisemitism allegations were merely a smear by wealthy Jews to stop a leftwing leader gaining power, itself an antisemitic conspiracy theory. Which should be funny, but isn’t. And now we have the horr

Tea may not be a common bartending staple (perhaps the best known tea cocktail, the Long Island iced tea, doesn’t actually count, because it has no tea in it) but it brings with it a smoky, aromatic complexity you won’t easily find elsewhere.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/nov/16/cant-decide-between-a-cuppa-and-a-cocktail-why-not-have-both-tea">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A new biography suggests everything we know about Dickens is wrong</p><p>Two years after Charles Dickens’s death in 1870, his closest friend, John Forster, published the first volume of his Life of Charles Dickens. Based on letters Dickens had written to him and stories he had told him, it was, in effect, an authorised biography. For Dickens buffs, it has always been both a matchless source and an untrustworthy narrative. By Helena Kelly’s account, it is more misleading than the most sceptical biographer has supposed. Far from Forster being Dickens’s hagiographer, he was his dupe. We have always known that Dickens aimed to manage his reputation; as Kelly sees it, this led him to deeper deceit than anyone has previously imagined.</p><p>So, for instance, Forster was the first to make public what Dickens said was the most crushing experience of his life: being sent, aged 12, to work in a blacking warehouse. It was an experience that he handed on to the young protagonist of David Copp

<p>Six people make an ecstatic voyage around Earth in this finely crafted meditation on hope, beauty, the ordinary and the spectacular</p><p>Six astronauts are bobbing about in a spacecraft, looking out at their planet as they circle it. From up here, 250 miles above the surface, Japan is a wisp. The Philippines appear “scarily frail”. Though the views are on a planetary scale, the object of their mesmerised observation is as intricate as a Fabergé egg. All of Europe is “outlined with fine precision”, ringed by a golden thread of night-lit roads. Autumn blooms in the Jiuzhaigou valley, Tunisian salt flats glow in <em>cloisonné</em> pink. The astronauts who turn and turn through Samantha Harvey’s finely crafted meditation on the Earth, beauty and human aspiration are in the process of understanding themselves in new ways, too.</p><p>Harvey has long been a fearless explorer in wild places.

<p>So much guilt, so much admin … Life is far easier when you’re a kid and don’t have to worry about where you’ll be pulling crackers</p><p>Who is going to be where and with whom over Christmas? At either end of our lives, things become simpler because the decision tends to be made for us. It’s in midlife when the arrangements are at peak complexity. In your early days, if – and it’s a big if – you’re not split between two parents, then you have Christmas at home or, in a foretaste of tricky stuff to come, at one or other set of grandparents. Then you grow up and, should you partner up with someone, there will have to be a discussion as to whose family you go to. Throw children into the mix and the pressure ratchets up a notch or two. Because Christmas is all about the children, as we established when we were children ourselves, therefore everyone’s preferred option is to be with the bairns, and they can’t be everywhere.</p><p>Come midlife, you have adult children – and possibly thei

<p>From Santa Specials for excited children to a luxury Yuletide Evening Express for the grownups, these colourful trips will get you into the festive spirit</p><p>There’s an affinity between trains and Christmas, but what precisely is the connection? Ghostliness comes into it – the mystique of a train in the wintry night. I think of the misty, hypnotic adaptation of Dickens’s story The Signalman, in 1976, part of the BBC’s A Ghost Story for Christmas strand; or the ghost story in the Christmas number of the Railway magazine (that publication’s only excursion into whimsicality is always worth reading).</p><p>Prof Paul Salveson, founder of the Community Rail movement, has written some excellent railway ghost stories, but he thinks the more profound connection is that “trains bring us home to our loved ones, and they have a sense of warmth and comfort that cars don’t have”. He recalls, from the 1960s, “lots of “Christmas extras” taking hundreds of people home, to and from Leeds, Manche

<p>Documentary about the woman with whom John Lennon had an affair during his marriage to Yoko Ono reveals that Ono was pulling the strings</p><p>As Yoko Ono enters her 90s, it is perhaps a tactless time to release a documentary about the woman with whom John Lennon had a love affair during a rough patch in his marriage from about 1973 to 1975, what he ungallantly called his “lost weekend”. This is the couple’s then assistant, the extremely smart Chinese-American May Pang, in her early 20s at the time, who emerges with grace and dignity from this engrossing film.
