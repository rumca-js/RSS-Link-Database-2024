A big case has shocked the financial industry in China. It’s a story that has brought tears to ordinary Chinese as well. 
On November 4, 2023, Shanghai’s state-owned development group Lujiazui issued an announcement, exposing the seven-year “toxic land case” to the public. Why is it so shocking? 
Shanghai Lujiazui Co., Ltd. is well-known in China's financial circle. A state-owned enterprise, it’s mainly responsible for developing land in the Lujiazui Finance and Trade Zone, the country's only national development zone with "Finance and Trade" in its name. It ranked first among the "Top Ten Listed Real Estate Companies in China in 2003" by the Development Research Center of the State Council of China.
