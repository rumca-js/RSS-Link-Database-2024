		A paper that has just been accepted to the Association for Computing Machinery’s (ACM) Transactions on Privacy and Security journal outlines a proposed universal face obfuscation method for a family of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) facial recognition algorithms.

The <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3632292">research paper</a>, authored by Chinese students at Xidian University and the University of South Florida, is titled like a proverb: “Eyes See Hazy while Algorithms Recognize Who You Are.” It argues that evolving privacy laws such as the <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/gdpr">GDPR</a> have made the need for obfuscation in facial recognition systems more pressing, which can result

		Uganda’s Bureau of Statistics (Ubos) says it is in the process of procuring biometric devices to be used for a delayed national population and housing census scheduled to begin on May 10, 2024.

The exercise, which had earlier been programmed for August 24 and 25 this year, was put off after Ubos failed to secure the necessary funding for the project, The Observer <a href="https://observer.ug/news/headlines/79763-all-set-for-national-census-next-year-statistics-bureau">reports</a>.

The statistics agency had reportedly requested for 132 billion Ugandan shillings (US$34.8 million) to procure 120,000 devices.

This will be the first population and housing census in Uganda in ten years and also the first to be conducted digitally, the outlet quotes Ubos

		<em>By Vito Fabbrizio Managing Director, Biometrics Business Unit, <a href="https://www.hidglobal.com">HID</a></em>

Retailers are looking for ways to upgrade their security, control costs and improve customer experiences in order to compete in a challenging landscape. Fortunately, fingerprint biometrics have matured to the point that they can deliver each of these benefits without burdening stores or staff with major costs or a complicated system overhaul.

As retailers have digitized, they have networked back-of-house and point-of-sale systems, introducing the potential to improve efficiency with as-yet underutilized tools like peripheral fingerprint scanners. These systems can yield significantly more value by integrating fingerprint biometrics, often with a simp
