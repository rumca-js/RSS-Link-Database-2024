Also available on PlayStation and Xbox.\n\nI enjoy Modern Warfare 3\u2019s multiplayer in the same way I\u2019ve enjoyed nearly every one of Call of Duty\u2019s competitive kill-fests. When you get down to it, there are few games out there that can match how this series looks and feels in the heat of a firefight. To its credit, this year\u2019s game has brought back some great maps and made some meaningful tweaks to movement and recoil mechanics. But\u2026 that\u2019s kind of it for what you get with Modern Warfare 3\u2019s contributions \u2013 there aren\u2019t any big new ideas to change up the same gunbattles we\u2019ve had for years, with the most thrilling one being that cosmetic purchases carry over from Modern Warfare 2, which is only possible because so little has changed. Especially when you put those improvements next to a cumbersome and frustrating new progression system, it\u2019s not enough to get excited about.\n\n#IGN #Gaming #CallOfDuty", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZirpW25nIYI", "date_published": "2023-11-16T00:07:17+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "Ign - YouTube", "album": "Ign - YouTube", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/ZirpW25nIYI/hqdefault.jpg", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "title": "Mortal Kombat 1: How to Perform Hidden Brutalities for Omni-Man and Li-Mei", "description": "In addition to the six brutalities per character, it's been discovered that there are also hidden alternate brutalities as well!
