In today's Daily Fix:
A recent job posting very strongly hints that the upcoming Wonder Woman game is a live-service project. So, expect micro-transactions and a strong online component. Maybe. Publisher Warner Bros. Games hasn't shown anything from the game itself, aside from a cinematic teaser back in 2021. In other live-service games news, Fortnite is adding a new voice reporting feature. If you think people on your voice chat are violating community rules, it'll be a little easier to report them to Epic's moderators. And finally, Assassin's Creed Mirage is getting a New Game+ mode, and permadeath if you want extreme assassinating realism.

Assassin's Creed Nexus VR reviewed on Meta Quest 3 by Travis Northup. Also available on Meta Quest 2/Pro.

Assassin’s Creed Nexus VR isn’t just another fragmented tech demo, but a fully realized Assassin’s Creed game that benefits greatly from its new medium and breathes life into the familiar Ubisoft formula. Running across rooftops in Renaissance-era Italy and sneaking through the streets of ancient Athens is a blast, and the fact that none of that made me want to hurl is a testament to just how much Nexus takes advantage of the Meta Quest 3’s shiny new hardware. It’s unfortunate that combat seems like an afterthought compared to the rest of Nexus’s polished systems, and occasional technical issues and immersion-breaking bugs definitely pulled me out of the experience from time to time. Even so, Nexus has reignited my interest in virtual reality, as only dancing through the streets of Venice as Ezio could do – and it feels good to be back.

Check out the trailer for Imaginary, an upcoming horror movie starring DeWanda Wise, Tom Payne, Taegan Burns, Pyper Braun, with Veronica Falcon, and Betty Buckley.

From Blumhouse, the minds that brought you Five Nights at Freddy's and M3GAN, comes an original horror that taps into the innocence of imaginary friends – and begs the question: Are they really figments of childhood imagination or is something more terrifying lying just beneath?

When Jessica (DeWanda Wise) moves back into her childhood home with her family, her youngest stepdaughter Alice (Pyper Braun) develops an eerie attachment to a stuffed bear named Chauncey she finds in the basement. Alice starts playing games with Chauncey that begin playful and become increasingly sinister.

As Alice’s behavior becomes more and more concerning, Jessica intervenes only to realize Chauncey is much more than the stuffed toy bear she believed him to be.

Lionsgate and Blumhouse present, a Tower of Babble production.

The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, reviewed by Emma Stefansky. Narrated by Max Scoville.

The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes sees director Francis Lawrence return to the YA dystopia in which kids are forced to hunt and kill each other for the entertainment of a privileged ruling class. It works as a faithful adaptation of Suzanne Collins’ prequel novel, yet falls flat when it comes to depicting the maze of interpersonal manipulation and emotions that make up its main characters’ ultimately doomed relationship. Actors Tom Blyth and Rachel Zegler are brilliant additions to the franchise with equally magnetic takes on their very different characters, but aren’t given enough time to fully flesh them out.

Forced to confront revelations about her past, she forges a relationship with three young women destined for powerful futures... if they can all survive a deadly present.’ The #Spiderman cinematic universe is apparently growing.

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 Multiplayer reviewed by Stella Chung on PC. Also available on PlayStation and Xbox.

I enjoy Modern Warfare 3’s multiplayer in the same way I’ve enjoyed nearly every one of Call of Duty’s competitive kill-fests. When you get down to it, there are few games out there that can match how this series looks and feels in the heat of a firefight. To its credit, this year’s game has brought back some great maps and made some meaningful tweaks to movement and recoil mechanics. But… that’s kind of it for what you get with Modern Warfare 3’s contributions – there aren’t any big new ideas to change up the same gunbattles we’ve had for years, with the most thrilling one being that cosmetic purchases carry over from Modern Warfare 2, which is only possible because so little has changed. Especially when you put those improvements next to a cumbersome and frustrating new progression system, it’s not enough to get excited about.

This video will show how to perform them by holding down both the Stance Switch and Block buttons while performing the brutality, like normal.
