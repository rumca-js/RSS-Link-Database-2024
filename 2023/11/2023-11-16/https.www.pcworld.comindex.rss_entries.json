Not only do monitor arms provide you with a lot more options to move and position your display/s around your desk, but they also free up space on your desk surface, leaving it open for other use. Plus, they help your setup look sharp, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is only one catch: the price. Most monitor arms worth buying are close to $200, and heavy-duty arms are even pricier. It&rsquo;s important to buy the right monitor arm the first time so you&rsquo;re left feeling like you got your money&rsquo;s worth. To that end I put several popular monitor arms through their paces.
