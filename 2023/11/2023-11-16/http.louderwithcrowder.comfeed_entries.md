</p><p>Bud Light suffered a lot from its marketing choices in April. Even Mulvaney threw the company under the bus. </p><p>Anheuser-Busch CEO Brendan Whitworth previously claimed that the Mulvaney beer can was essentially a “gift” to the trans influencer and that it was just printed on one can. Basically, claiming that it was never intended to be for sale to the general public. </p><p>A document obtained by Mug Club Undercover shows that Mulvaney was paid $185,000 by Bud Light.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

To be clear, it goes in one direction. Republicans can be friends with Democrats. Democrats are the ones raised to believe the only reason Republicans hold any opposing viewpoints is because of racist, sexist, trans/islamo/homophobia. It's been that way since the 2000s when there was literally no conversation a liberal couldn't turn into how much they hated George W. Bush.</p><p>Republicans are NOT the ones
