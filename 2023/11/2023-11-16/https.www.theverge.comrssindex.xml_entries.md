The first, Dream Track, already seeded to a few creators on the platform, is designed to auto-generate short 30-second music tracks in the style of famous artists. The feature can imitate <a href="https://blog.youtube/creator-and-artist-stories/youtube-dream-track-ai-artists/">nine different artists</a>, who’ve chosen to collaborate with YouTube on its development.

<p id="WqeZAD">Bard will be available for teens in “most countries around the world” as long as they meet Google’s minimum age requirement to be in charge of their own account, Doshi says. (For many countries, that age is 13; Google lists the exceptions <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1350409?hl=en#zippy=">in a support document</a>.)
