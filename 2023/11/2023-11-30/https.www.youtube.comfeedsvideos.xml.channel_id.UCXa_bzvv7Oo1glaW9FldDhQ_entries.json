It was good news for a fanbase waiting for anything regarding the franchise and getting vague reassurances that it's not dead. \n\nThe fact that the development team wanted to make it possible to complete the entire game in a non-lethal fashion while retaining the feel of the original was also great news.\n\nHowever, the last major development update was earlier this year and thus far, the remake is still considered in the \"early production\" stage. It's always tough to wait for a video game's release, especially when it's a remake of one of the most beloved stealth titles. So where the heck is it, and what could be the hold-up?
