It doesn't mean the game has suddenly gone first-person, but it does mean optional - and fluidly interchangeable - WASD movement is coming to the series for the first time. And that you can now move slightly while attacking. </p><p>The Mercenary revolves around the crossbow weapon they carry, which behaves - depending on the type of crossbow - like either a shotgun, an assault rifle, or a sniper rifle. You can carry two kinds of crossbow at the same time. </p><p>What your crossbow does also depends heavily on the kind of ammo you're using. If you're using incendiary ammo, for instance, your assault rifle crossbow will spin-up like a mini-gun and be devastating - and fiery - once revved up. Meanwhile,

Xbox chief financial officer Tim Stuart has said Microsoft wants to get Game Pass and its first-party titles on "every screen that can play games" - including Switch and PlayStation - in what he calls "a bit of a change of strategy".
</p><p>
This isn't the first time Microsoft has talked about getting Xbox Game Pass on all platforms, of course; Xbox boss Phil Spencer has referenced the strategy on multiple occasions, calling it a "long term goal" for the company back in 2019.
</p><p>
One year on from that comment, however, it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-game-pass-now-sounds-unlikely-to-launch-on-switch-playstation">seemed as if Spencer had admitted defeat</a> in getting Game Pass on competing consoles, saying, "The other competitive platforms really aren't interested in having a full Xbox experience on their hardwa

Sons of the Forest is leaving early access. It will be getting its beefier version 1.0 release next year, on 22nd February. 
</p><p>
In addition, developer Endnight Games has announced that Shawn Ashmore - whom you will likely recognise from Remedy's Quantum Break and, more recently, Alan Wake 2 - has joined the cast. He will be voicing Timmy.
</p><p>
Timmy, for those unaware, is the son of Eric LeBlanc, protagonist of the first game (which was simply known as The Forest). Endnight Games has said his role in the story will be expanded when version 1.0 goes live next year.

Capcom will sell Dragon's Dogma 2 for $70 on PC (via Steam), PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S when the long-awaited sequel arrives next March.
</p><p>
It marks the first time Capcom will sell the base version of a new game for that higher price point. This year's Resident Evil 4 Remake was sold for $10 less (and while a remake, it was substantially different). Street Fighter 6 was also sold at for less, as was dino hunter Exoprimal.
</p><p>
Capcom had been one of the few publishers not to embrace the $70 price point up until now, but the move comes as no surprise.

Absurd Ventures, the studio established by Rockstar co-founder Dan Houser earlier this year, has revealed its first two projects: a graphic novel and audio drama, both launching in 2024.
</p><p>
When Absurd Ventures was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-co-founder-dan-houser-returns-with-new-media-company-absurd-ventures">unveiled back in June</a>, its promotional material made it clear Houser and company were aiming to do more than just make games - with the studio saying it was focused on "building narrative worlds, creating characters, and writing stories for a diverse variety of genres" spanning the likes of live-action, animation, games and other interactive content, books, graphic novels, scripted podcasts, and more.
</p><p>
And true to its word, Absurd Ventures has now unveiled its first two "universes": Ame

Netflix has <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-the-definitive-edition-arrives-on-netflix">announced</a> it'll be adding Rockstar's Grand Theft Auto 3, Vice City, and San Andreas - in their Definite Edition guises - to its gaming catalogue on 14th December.
</p><p>
The news follows reports earlier this year that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-reportedly-looking-to-license-gta-title-as-it-moves-into-higher-end-gaming">Netflix had been in talks with Rockstar</a> to license a GTA game as part of an attempt to introduce "higher-end" titles to its mobile-focused gaming catalogue - which primarily offers a mix of casual games and acclaimed indies at present, including the likes of Dead Cells, Kentucky Route Zero, and Shovel Knight: Pocket Dungeon.

A winter update will land in Monster Hunter Now next week, on Thursday 7th December.
</p><p>
Monster Hunter Snow, as I'm now calling it, will see its in-game world blanketed in a wintry landscape as it launches a new season - Filminations in the Frost - and unleashes a menagerie of new monsters.
</p><p>
Zinogre, Banbaro, Barioth and Radobaan will all be introduced, alongside the smaller Cortos and Wulg. The Monster Hunter Now team has also taken player feedback on board to bring in a couple of much-requested weapons, too: the lance and dual blades.
