The Seattle Building Emissions Performance Standard would apply to existing structures including skyscrapers, low- to high-rise buildings, multifamily residences, retail spaces, restaurants, churches, schools and universities, and community centers. Buildings account for 37% of Seattle&#8217;s carbon emissions, behind transportation&#8217;s 61% contribution, according to data from the city. The greenhouse gas sources are primarily oil and natural gas, including fossil fuel-powered furnaces and water heaters, gas stoves, and fuel leaks&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2023/seattle-preps-for-new-rules-requirin", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2023/seattle-preps-for-new-rules-requiring-more-than-4000-buildings-to-cut-fossil-fuel-use-by-2050", "date_published": "2023-11-30T17:54:13+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "GeekWire", "album": "GeekWire", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://www.geekwire.com/wp-content/themes/geekwire/dist/images/geekwire-logo-rss.png", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed/", "title": "Manufacturing software startup Retrocausal raises $5.3M to help workers assemble products", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"945\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Retrocausal-Founding-Team-1260x945.png\" width=\"1260\" /><br />Retrocausal, a Seattle-area software startup using AI technology to help manufacturers and their employees, announced a $5.3 million investment round. Founded in 2019, the Redmond, Wash.-based startup provides real-time instructions and feedback to front-line manufacturing employees on the factory floor. The software, which works with cameras and other tools such as barcode scanners, also compiles statistics and reports into an analytics dashboard. Part of the company&#8217;s pitch is to use technology to address the labor shortage in manufacturing, helping untrained workers become more productive.

Don&#8217;t get your hopes up that Sam Altman will actually wire the money. That&#8217;s what Blake Resnick&#8217;s dad told him after the call.

And that&#8217;s not in relation to new products or services. It&#8217;s about how the people who make those things will actually work and interact with one another in a space that&#8217;s a testing ground of sorts. Despite a pause in construction that&#8217;s impacting Amazon&#8217;s ambitious growth plans in Bellevue, the 42-story skyscraper rises to be the tallest building in the city.
