The Seattle Building Emissions Performance Standard would apply to existing structures including skyscrapers, low- to high-rise buildings, multifamily residences, retail spaces, restaurants, churches, schools and universities, and community centers. Buildings account for 37% of Seattle&#8217;s carbon emissions, behind transportation&#8217;s 61% contribution, according to data from the city. The greenhouse gas sources are primarily oil and natural gas, including fossil fuel-powered furnaces and water heaters, gas stoves, and fuel leaks&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/seattle-preps-for-new-rules-requirin

Don&#8217;t get your hopes up that Sam Altman will actually wire the money. That&#8217;s what Blake Resnick&#8217;s dad told him after the call. This was long before the OpenAI CEO became known beyond Silicon Valley. Dr. Michael Resnick didn&#8217;t know exactly who Altman was.

And that&#8217;s not in relation to new products or services. It&#8217;s about how the people who make those things will actually work and interact with one another in a space that&#8217;s a testing ground of sorts. Despite a pause in construction that&#8217;s impacting Amazon&#8217;s ambitious growth plans in Bellevue, the 42-story skyscraper rises to be the tallest building in the city.

XPRIZE Healthspan was unveiled today at a conference in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. It&#8217;s the richest incentive-based technology competition ever created by the XPRIZE foundation, beating out a $100 million XPRIZE Carbon Removal contest that&#8217;s being funded by Elon Musk, the world&#8217;s richest (and most controversial) billionaire.

The change may help prevent Microsoft, a major OpenAI investor, from being left out of the company&#8217;s consequential decision-making — such as the ouster of Sam Altman earlier this month. Less than a week after Altman&#8217;s dismissal, and following pressure from OpenAI employees threatening to leave, OpenAI announced on Nov. 21 that Altman would return as CEO, under a newly formulated board. The new board consists of former Salesforce CEO Bret Taylor — who is now chairman — along with&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/microsoft-gets-openai-board-seat-as-non-voting-observer/">Read More</a>
