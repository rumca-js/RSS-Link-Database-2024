<p>Every Texas A&amp;M donor helping to fund Jimbo Fisher’s buyout could have put that check toward tablets or school lunches in a poor district</p><p>Texas A&amp;M University fired football coach Jimbo Fisher on Sunday, amid his latest disappointing season. The axing is richly deserved. The money Fisher will get <em>not</em> to work is not. In late 2017, A&amp;M poached Fisher – who had won a national championship at Florida State in 2013 – from FSU with a 10-year, $75m, fully guaranteed contract that broke the collegiate record with its total value. The school extended that deal and tacked on dollars in 2021, but Fisher’s performance never got close to matching his paycheck, and the “fully guaranteed” part of the contract would come back to haunt the Aggies. He lost at least four games every year but 2020, when pandemic interruptions created a zany season whose chaos included a 9-1 record and No 4 finish in the rankings for A&amp;M. But even that team fell short of loftier goals li
