I'm continuing the build out of the data flow, which is flowing data from the database (Supabase), through the backend via APIs, and displayed on the frontend so I can use real data as I build out more of the UI/UX with React, NextJS, and TailwindCSS.

I'm building a platform for programmers and folks interested in computer science to discuss current tech & programming news, how we can utilize it as programmers, and what it means for us and the software development industry. It's under the same umbrella as the Dev Notes newsletter, which is a newsletter for programmers and folks interested in computer science - but the platform is to foster community and encourage discussion about these topics.
