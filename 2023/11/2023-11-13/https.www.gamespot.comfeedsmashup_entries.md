<p>Few video game controllers are as iconic (infamous?) as the Duke, the controller that originally came with the first Xbox console. Roughly the size of a dinner plate with the thickness of a bowl, it was eventually replaced with a controller that was more ergonomically pleasing. But for those true believers looking to get their hands around a Duke-shaped peripheral again, there is some good news. Over at Amazon, you can pick up an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09FYFT4NN?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20">officially licensed Duke replica</a> that is not only shaped like the real deal, but also celebrates the 20th anniversary of Xbox with its striking design. Normally $65, you can save 34% with this early <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/black-friday/">Black Friday deal</a>, dropping the price to only $42.69. </p><figure style="width: 1280px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4219683-duke.png"><img alt="Hyperkin's 20th-anniversary replica of the Duke." src

<p>In September, comments from The Office co-creator Greg Daniels sparked speculation about a potential series reboot. In an interview with <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/the-office-reboot-update-greg-daniels-mandalorian/">The Wrap</a>, Daniels clarified, expressing a preference for a new direction in the same universe rather than a complete overhaul. He firmly stated that any revisit of The Office would not be a reboot.</p><p dir="ltr">"I don't like to think of anything as a reboot, you know what I mean? Because I feel like we ended that story beautifully. The characters had closure," Daniels said. "I would never want to redo that same show with a different cast, because I think we got the luckiest cast, the best cast ever, in TV, to do that show. So the notion of a reboot is not of interest."</p><p dir="ltr">Rather than a reboot, Daniels expressed a desire to explore the universe further, drawing a parallel with Star Wars spinoff shows.

<p>Blizzard senior art director Samwise Didier, who joined the company in 1991 while it was still called Silicon and Synapse and would define the studio's art style, has retired after 32 years.</p><p dir="ltr">Didier's contributions to Blizzard were numerous. For starters, he came up with the name Warcraft, which came from his Dungeons and Dragons character at the time and was a riff on the word witchcraft. He served as an art director on Blizzard's major franchises from the very beginning, helping to create the developer's signature art style, a style that would look right at home on the cover of a heavy metal album. He created Warcraft's Pandaren race, served as a producer on numerous Blizzard titles, and has lent his voice, music, and storytelling skills to numerous Blizzard games over the years.</p><div><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">What lies beyond the storm? <a href="https://t.co/iQh9B2DLBZ">pic.twitter.com/iQh9B2DLBZ</a></p>  — Sam Are I (@Samwi
