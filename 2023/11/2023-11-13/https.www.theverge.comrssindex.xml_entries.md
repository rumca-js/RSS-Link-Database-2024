  <p id="CllNkA">When I ask Frank Cifaldi, the founder and director of the Video Game History Foundation, to explain the importance of preserving and maintaining old video games, he answers with a movie analogy. Imagine, he said, “if movies were only released on, like, VHS, ever. You want to watch <em>Back to the Future? </em>All right, you have to go on eBay, and you have to find an antique VHS copy that’s degraded a bit from use.

  <p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="6UB64u">Sony’s new PlayStation Portal that launches November 15th is a $199.99 device that does just one thing: it streams games via Wi-Fi off of your home PlayStation 5, requiring that you already own Sony’s pricey console.</p>
<p id="0iXMkB">It doesn’t do any kind of cloud streaming like Nvidia’s Geforce Now or Sony’s own PlayStation Plus Premium subscription, and it can’t run anything locally (not even YouTube or Netflix). The Portal is purpose-built to use a singular feature Sony first debuted with t

  <p id="OTeGTQ">Google is suing scammers who are trying to use the hype around generative AI to trick people into downloading malware, the company has announced.
