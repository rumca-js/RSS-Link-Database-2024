The company is shutting down two gaming initiatives, Crown Channel and Game Growth, according to an internal memo from Christoph Hartmann, vice president of Amazon Games. The shift will result in &#8220;just over&#8221; 180 employees losing their job. &#8220;We are proud of the work the teams have been doing, pushing into new areas with weekly content on Crown Channel, and finding more ways to help publishers reach new audiences with Game Growth,&#8221; Hartmann wrote in the memo, which Amazon shared with GeekWire. &#8220;But after further evaluation of our&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/amazon-lays-off-more-employees-from-gaming-division-as-part-of-strategy-shift/">Read More</a>

But what some are hungry for is a slice of his $160 billion fortune, which could have a meaningful impact on the massive challenges of homelessness, drug addiction, income inequality and struggling schools that are eroding communities in the Pacific Northwest. News of Bezos&#8217; departure has people wondering whether one of the world&#8217;s richest people will direct some of his charitable giving to the drizzly Seattle area once he&#8217;s ensconced in sunny Miami &#8212; and&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/jeff-bezos-may-leave-seattle-a-piece-of-my-heart-but-some-hope-for-a-slice-of-his-future-philanthropy/">Read More</a>

The fiancée of Jeff Bezos also offers up an inside look at her relationship with the Amazon founder. Sanchez and Bezos, who have been together since at least 2019, got engaged earlier this year when he presented her with a gigantic pink diamond while aboard his $500 million mega-yacht. &#8220;When he opened the box, I think I blacked out a bit,&#8221; Sanchez told Vogue, in a profile&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/im-looking-forward-to-being-mrs-bezos-vogue-profiles-lauren-sanchezs-life-with-amazon-founder/">Read More</a>

The company said it can provide carbon storage for less than $100 per ton &#8212; a price point that the Biden administration set as the &#8220;earthshot&#8221; goal of its climate funding efforts. Memphis, Tenn.-based Graphyte takes advantage of the ability of trees and plants to naturally capture carbon through photosynthesis. The startup takes unwanted biomass including waste from logging and farming and&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/bill-gates-backed-startup-can-store-carbon-underground-for-1000-years-in-plant-based-bricks/">Read More</a>

The bill, CB 120706, would use revenue generated by the fee to help pay for the implementation and enforcement of recently passed &#8220;PayUp&#8221; gig worker protection laws in Seattle: one that sets minimum wage policies, and another related to regulations for the worker deactivation process. The bill, referred to the City Council last week, would require &#8220;network companies&#8221; operating in Seattle to pay the fees to obtain an annual license.
