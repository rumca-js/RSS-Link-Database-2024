It takes a lot for a person to legally come here with nothing but the clothes on their back. People typically do this in hopes of living out the “American Dream.” </p><p>Usually, that dream does not happen in the span of several months. It typically takes some time for hard-working individuals to become successful and make that a reality. </p><p>The same goes for both immigrants and native-born citizens. Some people think it comes easy for Americans, but we also have to work hard for the dream. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

We live in families, work in teams, engage in religious fellowship, and much more. In fact, we need cooperation to survive and thrive. It has also been understood for most of human history that social isolation, especially when it is perpetual, causes calamity for one's physical and mental health. </p><p>Knowing all this, “public health experts" and New York State and local officials forced residents to stay home against their will in an effort to not pass on sniffles that they may or may not have. Subsequently, for the first time in history, many people went months, some even years, without real-life socialization.</p><p>At the same time, <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/School_responses_in_New_York_to_the_coronavirus_(COVID-19)_pandemic

It was a stunning example of why the "however much you hate journalists, it's not enough" meme was created. The next time there is a poll labeling journalism the least trusted institution in America, Harwood will break the fourth wall and say, "Who, me?"</p><p>As it turns out, the interview was a blueprint for how Harwood expects his other hack journalismer colleagues to act. They aren't doing a good enough job campaigning for Joe Biden. And someone has to, since Biden himself stinks at it.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

She is very good and lecturing people about the planet and being insufferable. The problem is since she graduated from the high school she dropped out of (or, was "on strike") she is attempting to rally around whatever progressives are angry about that week. And at least one person is upset at her getting too political. He told her as much at a recent climate rally.</p><p>You see, he was there to listen to people complain about the climate. He was not there to listen to people complain about Jews. That's getting political as opposed to ranting about the planet being on fire and... just watch.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
