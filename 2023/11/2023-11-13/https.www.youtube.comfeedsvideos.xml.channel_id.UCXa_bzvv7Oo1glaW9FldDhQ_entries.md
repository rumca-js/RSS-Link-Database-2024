With 2023 coming to a close and The Game Awards nearing in December, it's worth looking back on all the great games. The new year starts with even more stellar titles, but one is seemingly missing since its last delay - Rocksteady's Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League.

Following its disastrous gameplay reveal, the co-op looter shooter was delayed from May 2023 to February 2nd, 2024. Neither the developer nor publisher Warner Bros. Games have offered any updates, though there has been the odd rumor or three. So, one has to ask: Where is it?

Could there be a new trailer at The Game Awards? Will it be delayed again? Is there a chance that it's undergone some changes since the last reveal? Join us as we ponder the title's future.

Call of Duty isn't the most well-respected of franchises in terms of quality and with this year's Modern Warfare 3, the series' reputation gone out the window in terms of quality, mission design and competent story telling.

The multiplayer falters with its matchmaking, latency and spawns. Overall, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 falls far below the genre's standards and struggles to justify its $70 price.
