As reported in a recent episode, the Chinese Communist Party launched a new propaganda campaign to " sing the praises of China's economy" and warned that "short-sellers" would be punished. Party leader Xi Jinping appeared at the Central Bank of China and the Bureau of Foreign Reserves. These are clear signals of the severity of China's financial risks.
Concerns are mounting about the financial stability and future growth momentum of the world's second-largest economy. Confidence in the CCP is slipping fast, and capital flight is accelerating. Like a chain reaction, this is reflected at the ordinary people and companies' end, that is, their deposits in the bank have become insecure.
