Today we'll explore this Unity-powered platformer from both gameplay and visual perspectives while weighing in on different versions of the game across multiple platforms, including PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC and Switch. </p><p>At its core, Sonic Superstars is a return to the classic side-scrolling Sonic formula, but constructed entirely in 3D. We've seen this before with varying levels of success, such as the classic Sonic stages built for Sonic Generations, but Superstars is the first title since the 16-bit era to crack the control physics conundrum t

Remedy plans to reboot its free-to-play co-op multiplayer game, codenamed Vanguard, as a premium release.
</p><p>
The game will be published by Tencent, but "due to uncertainties in creating a successful game to the rapidly changing free-to-play market and associated risks", both companies have "discussed a new direction" for the project.
</p><p>
It's got a new codename too: Kestrel.

A Baldur's Gate 3 player has laid down the Bear% gauntlet with a sex speedrun of under an hour.
</p><p>
The speedrunner, Weedmoder, currently holds the world record time of 50 minutes and 30 seconds and shared a video of the run online (thanks <a href="https://www.vg247.com/baldurs-gate-3-bear-sex-speedruns-are-finally-here-and-already-under-an-hour">VG247</a>).

</p><p>
Of course, the speedrun involves banging the bear, aka druid Halsin. That means completing his romance questline, which cannot be done until Act 3.

</p><p>Titled Content Streaming With Gameplay Launch, the patent was filed on 11th July 2023 and publically published on 2nd November via <a href="https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=US412494279&amp;_fid=US412494279">WIPO</a> (spotted by <a href="https://exputer.com/news/industry/sony-patent-game-any-part-replay/">Exputer</a>).

Bandai Namco has rounded off Tekken 8's launch roster with the introduction of its third brand-new character: Reina, the Purple Lightning.
</p><p>
Reina is the 32nd and final fighter to join the upcoming release's roster, but, as is always the case, last is certainly not the least. Her character promises lightning fast moves, and a mysterious interest in Jin. Why does she want to fight him so badly? We will have to wait to find out.

The newly-launched <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/modern-warfare-3-best-guns-meta-mw3-warzone-9328">Modern Warfare 3</a> still lacks a number of multiplayer maps this week, after developer Activision was forced to pull them from rotation soon after the game launched. 
</p><p>
Quarry, Rundown and Scrapyard were removed from the game's Hardpoint playlists last Thursday, 9th November, after players complained. In a <a href="https://twitter.com/CODUpdates/status/1722733280905331105">post</a> on its bug-tracking social media account, Activision acknowledged "an issue causing unfavourable spawns". 
</p><p>
Karachi was next to go last Friday, 10th November - binned from Modern Warfare 3's Cutthroat playlist while Activision, it said, worked to "resolve an issue causing a player to spawn alongside enemies".

Elden Ring player Let Me Solo Them has now helped 5000 people defeat the game's final boss.
</p><p>
Not to be confused with Let Me Solo Her, who assisted players with the iconic Malenia battle, Let Me Solo Them wears a similar jar helm attire but their focus is the game's pair of final bosses - hence the name.
</p><p>
"It has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my life and I'm sincerely grateful," said the player on reddit. "This marks the end of a chapter but I just wanted to say, thank you from the bottom of my heart to all the players that summoned me."

PlayStation 5 accounted for 51 percent of all console sales in the UK over the past six months.
</p><p>
Sony's latest console held a 43 percent share on all console sales between November 2022 and October 2023, according to UK chart firm GfK (via Eurogamer's sister site <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/are-video-game-consoles-set-for-a-bumper-black-friday">GamesIndustry.biz</a>).  But hone in on the last six months and the PS5's sales account for just over 50 percent of all console purchases since May.
</p><p>
GfK games boss Dorian Bloch said these figures are a result of various price promotions held over the summer months, the console's recent EA Sports FC bundle and, of course, "unrestricted sales" on the standard PlayStation 5 model. Unlike previous years, there are currently no supply and stock shorta

UK boxed sales for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/modern-warfare-3-best-guns-meta-mw3-warzone-9328">Modern Warfare 3</a> fell 25 percent short on last year's Modern Warfare 2 launch.

</p><p>
The new Modern Warfare 3 marks the first time Activision Blizzard has double dipped on the same Call of Duty sub-brand two years running to immediately release a direct sequel to the previous year's game. But controversy has swirled around the game's development and release.

If you log onto Sony Pictures Core today &ndash; an entertainment app for PlayStation I hadn't even heard of until yesterday &ndash; an advertisement for Genvid's new Silent Hill project, Silent Hill: Ascension, confidently straddles the page. Its blurb is brief but intriguing: "An occult ritual gone wrong. A monster on a farm, two deaths in two towns on the opposite sides of the world cause horrific monsters to manifest."
</p><p>
I've now watched over an hour of Silent Hill: Ascension and spent many more hours playing (and re-playing; even a week after launch, most progress I make from engaging in its activities habitually disappears) its mini-games and mooching around its various sub-menus, but that two-line description has told me more about what's happening in Silent Hill: Ascension than anything I've watched so f
