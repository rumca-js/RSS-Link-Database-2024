		Most people know the panic of heading to an event and suddenly feeling unsure you have your tickets with you – a problem that biometrics could relegate to the past, as venues explore how <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202308/philadelphia-phillies-lead-off-facial-recognition-access-pilot-for-big-league-baseball">facial verification</a> and other biometric tools can be used to expedite and enhance fan experience. A recent webinar hosted by <em>Biometric Update</em> brought together representatives from the biometric verification firm <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/veridas">Veridas</a>, along with industry expert Doug OGorden, to discuss how biometrics stands to change the fan journey as uptake increases across the sector.

		Making biometric liveness detection reliable and explainable requires recognizing that it is more than an algorithm, <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/neurotechnology">Neurotechnology</a> Research and Development Engineer Mantas Kundrotas said during a presentation at last week’s <a href="https://eab.org/events/program/325?ts=1692711723027">Face Image Quality Workshop</a>, hosted by The European Association for Biometrics. Quality metrics, Kundrotas argues, play a pivotal role in a complete liveness detection system.

The EAB event explored the current state of the art in face image quality metrics, and featured a series of presentations on new developments and panel discussions on ongoing issues in the field.

“Quality metrics are like a trusted vir

		The Indian state of Telangana is looking for up to 6,000 face biometrics and fingerprint scanners for to authenticate those testing for jobs.

Five hundred to 6,000 handheld scanners with integrated bar or QR readers is <a href="https://www.medianama.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/TSTS-exam-monitoring.pdf">needed</a> by the state's Government Examinations Conducting Agencies. Officials plan to operate one scanner for every 150 exam takers under a one-year contract that is renewable.

Bid submission deadline is November 18.

People wishing to take tests will submit two index fingers and a face image, which will be matched against a closed database of registered test takers. Bidders are required to include a de-duplication algorithm.

		A move by Kenya to increase fees for obtaining some personal identification documents has been momentarily blocked by a High Court in Nairobi as the government braces for a legal battle on the matter.

According to multiple Kenyan media reports, the conservatory order suspending the step was issued at the close of last week by a high court judge, Justice Lawrence Mugambi, following a lawsuit filed by a concerned citizen and surgeon, Dr. Magare Gikenyi. The case is set to be called up on November 26, The Standard <a href="https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/national/article/2001485045/reprieve-for-kenyans-as-court-halts-new-passports-id-charges">reports</a>.

		Researchers say they have devised lightweight software that can perform real-time fingerprint biometric liveness detection.

A team of scientists working in China, Portugal and Canada say their method requires shorter training and fewer parameters than previous approaches.

The researchers reportedly apply a broad learning system (BLS) to fingerprint liveness detection, something they say has not been done before, and something that does not required GPU training.

Other nonprofits are pointing to algorithm activity that might undercut biometrics reform goals.

The net result likely will be less clarity on UK policies.

Officials with Privacy International say they hired internet research firm YouGov to learn what 114 members of Parliament know about police use of face biometrics. There are 650 MPs.

According to PI, 70 percent of MPs didn't know if their constituency was subjected to facial recognition systems. Eighteen percent said it wasn't being used in their distric

		Sri Lanka is planning to launch a tender for the issuance of 5 million chip-embedded biometric passports, <a href="https://www.sundaytimes.lk/231112/news/bids-called-for-five-million-e-passports-with-embedded-chips-538402.html">The Sunday Times</a> reports.

The Ministry of Public Security’s Cabinet-Appointed Procurement Committee (CAPC) says the process will meet international standards for competitive bidding. Bidders should have an annual average turnover of US$17 million or higher, and cash flow of at least $1 million, according to the report. The bidder should also not be blacklisted.

The country is about to re-run a tender process for its national digital ID, after the company winning the first contract bid, Madras Security Printers (MSP), was <a href=

		Energy Web, a non-profit that develops open-source tech for clean energy transition, has teamed up with EU energy firm Elia Group to develop a digital identity app to facilitate energy and data exchange between the electrical grid and so-called “flexible assets” such as electric vehicles and heat pumps.

The app is based on self-sovereign identity (SSI) systems and can securely transfer digital ID data between different parties, according to a release. It is designed to be easily integrated into <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202311/final-agreement-on-eu-digital-identity-wallets-expands-scope-of-regulations">digital wallets</a>, leading to its adoption as an official project of the <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/openwallet-foundation-owf">OpenWa
