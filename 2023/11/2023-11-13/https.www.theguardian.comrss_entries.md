It’s as box-fresh as a new pair of Reeboks</p><p>A television show about a group of black teenagers coming of age in an urban sprawl evokes a particular image. Of gritty tragedy and gang warfare in a long-suffering, over-policed community.

<p>Anna Scher, who has died aged 78, gave acting classes to countless young people at her north London theatre school. Gary Kemp, Jake Wood, Winsome Pinnock, Trevor Laird and Ricardo P Lloyd recall a remarkable teacher</p><p>I first went to Anna’s school in Islington in 1969. I had some money from my paper round and used that to get in – I didn’t even tell my parents. A friend of mine had said it was good fun. The work we did was really improvisational. It was amazing for the kids who basically acted out problems from their daily lives. We were exorcising our issues through the drama but also learning how to be quick on our feet creatively. There were kids who had probably never been praised for anything, and on the cusp of getting in trouble, but she gave us praise. She’d find a kernel of brilliance in anybody and bring it out. No one was ever criticised as inadequate in any of the situations she put us in.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/nov/13/were-so-lucky-to-

And so opera isn’t just perceived (mistakenly) as elitist and expensive but also as uncool and irrelevant, especially by the young.</p><p>Scaled-down versions of classic favourites don’t come anywhere near an authentic experience, and touring them has limited effectiveness in growing audiences. Those of us further down the ladder, atte

<p>Bradley Cooper has audiences in raptures as electrifying conductor Leonard Bernstein in a new authorised biopic. Musicians from the London Symphony Orchestra remember playing for the great man – and rate the man who now plays him</p><p>The camera, like its subject, is hyperactive in Maestro. It swoops and pirouettes. It drops into the middle of frantic conversations, with barely a pause for breath as Bradley Cooper charms and dazzles as Leonard Bernstein. This is Lenny in his 1950s and 60s heyday, building a life with Felicia, played by Carey Mulligan. He is prodigious in both talent and appetite, a man of restless contradictions.</p><p>What there is very little of is music. We barely see him conduct, we hear only snatches of his own compositions, and there are frustratingly few glimpses of his passion for communicating – through performance and education – the wonders and riches of classical music.

<p>Johnson’s proposal unveiled at weekend would stretch funding until 19 January but doesn’t include cuts Republican colleagues are asking for</p><p>Good morning US politics blog readers. As the race against the clock to keep the government open continues, Speaker <strong>Mike Johnson</strong> found himself in a situation all too similar to that of his predecessor <strong>Kevin McCarthy</strong>: He won’t be able to secure the Democratic votes needed to reach an agreement.</p><p>On Saturday, Johnson unveiled an obfuscating, two-pronged funding plan that would stretch government funding to 19 January and include a spending bill to cover the budget until 2 February. The government is slated to shutdown on Friday if no agreement is reached and, given Johnson’s new proposal does not include any of the cuts that his Republican brethren are looking for, it’s not looking good. Though, it remains unclear how many, if any, Democrats the new bill may appeal to.</p><p>Senator <strong>Tim Scott<

<p>History isn’t just battles and monuments, everyday objects can tell us so much about previous eras and their changing moods</p><p>When my French grandmother died a few years ago, I holed myself up in her bathroom. I took one of her many lipsticks from the makeup cabinet, studied its half-used red nub, and found myself instantly transported back in time. Back to all the mornings on which I stood next to her, wide-eyed and wondering, as she applied the colour to her narrow lips. I thought of her, but also of her friends, her neighbours, the French women of her generation. Of a particular idea of womanhood. At that time, few women left the house without lipstick; for them, it was a question of attitude and respect. A way of inserting themselves into the ranks of “decent women”, who considered it one of their primary tasks to look beautiful and neat. Those little tubes of metal, black plastic and mother-of-pearl didn’t just say something about one woman – my grandmother – but testifie

<p>Spaniard’s relentless side look ever more like the real deal after brushing off Europa League fatigue to thrash Union Berlin</p><p>How to turn a football team around 180 degrees, parts one and two. Even after Bayer Leverkusen made the 4,000km journey back from Thursday night Europa League duty in Baku, and even after Union Berlin stopped their losing streak by picking up a point in Diego Maradona’s back garden, this could not have run more faithfully to current script.</p><p>At this time last year, Leverkusen and Union were polar opposites. Or almost. To be more precise at this exact point 12 months ago, the former were in 13th and the latter sitting up in second. The weeks immediately preceding that, even, had been the first evidence of the Xabi Alonso effect. When he had taken over as head coach of Leverkusen on 5 October, <em>Die Werkself</em> were second-bottom, a squad built to challenge for the Champions League glued in the relegation quagmire.</p> <a href="https://www.thegu

<p>Manchester City’s title challenge takes a hit, Arsenal find their shooting boots, and Marc Skinner laments complacency</p><p>There has been plenty of commentary around Arsenal’s lack of clinical finishing. Despite finding wins, they have looked unconvincing at times and before Sunday’s game, they had a shot to goal conversion rate of just 14%. In the second half against Leicester, however, they finally put those conversations to bed with a display of ruthless attacking football. Four goals in 12 minutes saw them turn around a two-goal deficit as they sliced through the defence with precision. Stina Blackstenius and Lina Hurtig netted two more to add to the Foxes’ woes. In an extra confidence boost, they had six different scorers, spreading the goals throughout the team. “When you see the players coming on and how involved they are in creating goalscoring opportunities, I really think that’s something that we can use during the season,” the Arsenal manager, Jonas Eidevall, said. “W

He is the tough drill officer who humiliates and bullies new recruits, bellowing at them to hit the floor and give him 25 press-ups. But it turns out that this Austrian drama directed by David Wagner (himself an army veteran) is inspired by true events. The real-life Eismayer was a gay man who lived a double life for many years, and then fell in love with a younger colleague.

For this question to make sense, a bit of context would probably be useful.

His reasons are two. Potatoes are wonderful! And they collapse as they cook, adding a starchy softness that thickens the soup Now, I agree with him wholeheartedly. However, I sometimes forget this important addition when making pasta and lentils or chickpea soup, meaning we now have a running (not very funny) joke that, when I do forget, we taste and invariably agree that it would have been better with<em> </em>the damned potato<em>.

<p>Eckhart can’t match his canine co-star (with titanium teeth) in this shonky and forgettable police thriller</p><p>No offence to Aaron Eckhart, but “Sad Aaron” doesn’t quite have the same emotional thwack to the soft parts as “Sad Keanu”. Like John Wick, Muzzle begins with a dead doggie, and Eckhart plays LAPD officer Jake Rosser, an army veteran with PTSD; his only meaningful relationship is with his K9 partner, a German shepherd called Ace. There’s an excruciating scene setting up their deep bond, Rosser musing on the misuse of the word “literally” as he drives to work, Ace listening dutifully in the passenger seat next to him.</p><p>When Ace is killed in a shootout, Rosser finds himself embroiled in a police scandal. Footage emerges from the crime scene of him head-butting a paramedic who insists – quite reasonably, you might think – on treating human casualties first. After a few sessions with the police therapist, Rosser is back on the job and out for revenge. His new partner

<p>The poet pays homage to Chekhov in her second collection, in which boredom is both feared and acknowledged<em> </em>and desperation tussles with wit</p><p>Laura Scott’s poetry is clear, illuminating yet not uncomplicated: there is a mystery at its edges, a recognition of how life slips away, unbiddable, non-compliant. In Email – involving two rooms with a view – the challenge in responding to the email that makes up the first half of the poem encompasses, one guesses, a greater and unexplored difficulty beyond how the leaves or branches or sky are behaving. The poem’s question “So how do I reply?” underpins much of her writing, a chastening self-doubt that contributes to her attractive power as a poet.</p><p>Scott’s wonderful debut, <em><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/so-many-rooms-9781784108496">So Many Rooms</a></em>, established her as a devotee of Russian literature – especially Tolstoy. And here, again, she honours literature as a living presence and shows how what we r

<p>Chelsea are becoming great entertainers, Zinchenko provides solutions for Arsenal and Fulham need goals</p><p>If in doubt, watch Chelsea. For <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/nov/06/tottenham-chelsea-premier-league-match-report">the second time</a> in six days, Mauricio Pochettino’s blend of youth and experience staged a fabulous show and scored four times against a fellow member of the old Big Six. Their 4-4 against Manchester City was not so much a soap opera, more a box-set thriller squeezed into 105 minutes. When City took the lead through the two most boring words in the football lexicon – “Haaland pen” – it wasn’t hard to see Chelsea crumbling. But then they had gone a goal down at Spurs too. They showed tremendous mettle, and soon they were 2-1 up. City regained the lead, then lost it, then grabbed it again – only for Cole Palmer to save a point and join Raheem Sterling on the scoresheet. Pep Guardiola is happy to sell players to other big clubs, and they

<p>Olympic medallist’s questioning of whether the pursuit for glory is worth it has exposed the pitfalls of an athlete’s career</p><p>“I almost question, is it really worth it? If I’ve damaged myself for the rest of my life?” It sounds like a lament from a punch-drunk fighter with holes in their memory and bank balance. Or an old rugby prop, slurry and soaked with regrets. But these words were uttered last week by a British Tokyo 2020 medallist, Holly Bradshaw, as she asked whether the relentless pursuit of sporting glory had harmed her body and mind.</p><p>It was a brave area to explore, given that most Britons reflexively believe the drive for Olympic success is overwhelmingly a force for good – and that those who receive lottery money to chase their dreams should count themselves lucky. But Bradshaw’s unflinchingly raw yet vital testimony exposed the pitfalls lurking amid the garlands.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/nov/13/bradshaw-deserves-credit-for-bri

<p>Performing naked except for a well-positioned accordion, sprig of parsley or mirror, Eliona Haines tackles labia-shaming by chopping up slices of beef and grilling them. She explains all to our writer</p><p>Eloina Haines always knew she wanted to be on stage as herself, rather than perform in a play that “some old white dude wrote a million years ago”. A queer performance artist known solely by her first name, Eloina has made shows about menstruation, body hair and female ejaculation since graduating in 2018 and is quite often undressed on stage. The nakedness is always for a reason, she stresses. “It is about decensoring the body for myself,” she says. “At the same time, it’s to liberate others in their own bodies.”</p><p>She began by performing in underground spaces – the kind of weird and wonderful cabaret nights that switch from burlesque to drag “to a video piece about birthing – and then someone emerges wearing a pig’s head,” she says playfully.</p> <a href="https://www.theg
