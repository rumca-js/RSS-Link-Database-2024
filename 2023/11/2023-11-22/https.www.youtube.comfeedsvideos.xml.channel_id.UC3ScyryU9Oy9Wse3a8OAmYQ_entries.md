The award-winning documentary “20 Days in Mariupol” follows Chernov as he and his Ukrainian AP colleagues become trapped in the besieged city of Mariupol, struggling to continue their work documenting atrocities of the Russian invasion. The last international journalists remaining in the city as Russian forces close in, Chernov, photographer Evgeniy Maloletka and field producer Vasilisa Stepanenko captured what become some of the most defining images of the war: dying children, mass graves — and the maternity hospital bombing.
