If we can offload these kinds of tasks to AI, I think humans can then work on more complex things that they are more suited to, which involves critical thinking, and creativity. What this will allow humans to do is to solve problems that they&#8217;ve never been able to solve before.” That’s one of the thoughts from Dr. Vasi Philomin, vice president of generative AI at Amazon Web Services (AWS), on this episode of Shift AI, a show that explores what it takes to thrive&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/shift-ai-podcast-laying-the-bedrock-for-generative-ai-at-amazon-with-aws-vp-vasi-philomin/">Read More</a>

Although the details are still being worked out, according to OpenAI, it&#8217;s not yet clear if Microsoft will emerge with more oversight, or at least better insight, into the governance of a company in which it has invested billions of dollars. &#8220;We are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,&#8221; Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/sam-altmans-return-to-openai-is-a-first-essential-step-to-stability-microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-says/">Read More<
