It doesn\u2019t really offer much in the way of unit choices that could potentially make up your armies. \n\nYou\u2019re incentivized to keep your armies smaller, while also making use of several abilities that each unit has. While the game may not offer many different unique tactical and strategic options, it\u2019s a good entry point for newcomers to the genre.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ajnpx6RRP0", "date_published": "2023-11-22T17:30:00+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "GamingBolt", "album": "GamingBolt", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/-ajnpx6RRP0/hqdefault.jpg", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "Why \"Dark Souls 4.5\" Is ONE OF THE SUPRISE HITS OF THE YEAR (Lords of the Fallen 2023)", "description": "In what is undoubtably a saturated sub-genre, it\u2019s remarkable two games can release in quick succession which imitate the Soulslike formula but embellish on it in unique ways. Lies of P has been well received, but Lords of the Fallen (or Dark Souls 4.5 as the developer refers it in an interview) has reached the one million sales landmark in a rapid ten days, indicating a surprise hit. \n\nPrincipal behind its success is clever, interweaving world design, precise, exhilarating combat, and immersive exploration through two distinct realms. Performance issues at launch might have hampered sales too, but the developer have been diligent in their reparation of any technical issues, and the result is a Soulslike game that\u2019ll please veterans of the genre and newcomers alike.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qKlc940XxM", "date_published": "2023-11-22T15:00:10+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "GamingBolt", "album": "GamingBolt", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/7qKlc940XxM/hqdefault.jpg", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "IS STARFIELD IN TROUBLE?", "description": "When it launched, Starfield saw millions of players and strong reviews from critics. Even the impressions from players were strong, despite the game's shortcomings, and it seemed like Microsoft finally had its flagship exclusive for Xbox Series X/S.\n\nHowever, recent weeks have shown a turnabout in Starfield's fortunes. Its concurrent player count has drastically fallen in less than three months, with The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim Special Edition currently played more. The once-positive user reviews on Steam have now dropped to Mixed, and more players are expressing frustration at the game.\n\nWhat happened? How did one of the biggest games of 2023 end up like this? Could this spell trouble for its future, especially when it's barely getting started?
