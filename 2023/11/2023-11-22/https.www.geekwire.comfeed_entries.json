If we can offload these kinds of tasks to AI, I think humans can then work on more complex things that they are more suited to, which involves critical thinking, and creativity. What this will allow humans to do is to solve problems that they&#8217;ve never been able to solve before.\u201d That\u2019s one of the thoughts from Dr. Vasi Philomin, vice president of generative AI at Amazon Web Services (AWS), on this episode of Shift AI, a show that explores what it takes to thrive&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2023/shift-ai-podcast-laying-the-bedrock-for-generative-ai-at-amazon-with-aws-vp-vasi-philomin/\">Read More</a>", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2023/shift-ai-podcast-laying-the-bedrock-for-generative-ai-at-amazon-with-aws-vp-vasi-philomin", "date_published": "2023-11-22T19:14:16+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "GeekWire", "album": "GeekWire", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://www.geekwire.com/wp-content/themes/geekwire/dist/images/geekwire-logo-rss.png", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed/", "title": "Sam Altman\u2019s return to OpenAI is \u2018a first essential step\u2019 to stability, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella says", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"841\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/altman-dev-day-4-1260x841.jpg\" width=\"1260\" /><br />OpenAI&#8217;s announcement last night that Sam Altman will return as CEO, under a newly formulated board, brings an apparent end to a wild ride that spotlighted OpenAI&#8217;s unusual corporate structure, and demonstrated Microsoft&#8217;s tenuous control over the situation despite its giant stake in the company.
