It’s somewhat incredible when you look at the full story, but once again, the DOJ has failed in its attempt to claim that Backpage founder/editor Michael Lacey was facilitating sex trafficking with the site.

In Italy, an age-verification coalition against porn is getting traction. On September 4th, the Minister of Family Eugenia Roccella, representing the right-wing majority,&#160;initiated&#160;consultations for introducing a law to prevent minors from accessing pornographic content. On November 13th, the Democratic Party (currently the main opposition party)&#160;presented&#160;the Digital Innovation Act, whose&#160;Article 17&#160;aims to prevent minors from accessing [&#8230;]

There are few moves that make reporting more credible than suing the reporter for defamation and losing. It not only revives the negative reporting that might have faded into the white noise of constant internet churn, but also exposes the plaintiff as someone unable to handle being the subject of factual reporting. The Streisand Effect, [&#8230;]

In a recent post we highlighted just a [&#8230;]

We&#8217;ve noted many times how the GOP&#8217;s obsession with TikTok is stupid, performative, and utterly hollow. For example, the party desperately wants to ban TikTok for &#8220;privacy reasons,&#8221; yet consistently opposes passing privacy laws, or regulating data brokers that traffic in far more data &#8212; at a far greater international scale &#8212; than TikTok executives [&#8230;]

The thin blue line between cops and cop-friendly tech continues to be erased, mostly by cops.
