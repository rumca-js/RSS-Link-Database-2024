But there's only one William Prince. The singer-songwriter from the Peguis First Nation has a disarming presence at the Tiny Desk \u2014 his voice warm, eyes smiling.\n\nPrince had flown into Washington, D.C., on a red-eye flight. Jetlagged, he took a long nap on one of our couches, roused himself, then quietly commanded the room. These songs, two of which are from his 2023 album Stand in the Joy, swoon at the wonders of love, but more importantly give partners space to grow and bloom over time. Prince had performed a Tiny Desk (home) concert in 2021, so here he improvises a little song of gratitude with a wink: \"I'd thought the Desk would be tinier.\"\n\nSET LIST\n\"Tanqueray\"\n\"Goldie Hawn\"\n\"The Spark\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nWilliam Prince: guitar, vocals\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducers: Suraya Mohamed, Bob Boilen\nDirector/Editor: Maia Stern\nAudio Engineer: Josephine Nyounai\nVideogra", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fj3tpPKUFaA", "date_published": "2023-11-22T10:00:29+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "NPR Music", "album": "NPR Music", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/fj3tpPKUFaA/hqdefault.jpg", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}]
