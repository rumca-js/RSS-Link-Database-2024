		Massachusetts lawmakers have proposed to restrict the use of facial recognition technology by law enforcement, according to <a href="https://www.wbur.org/news/2023/11/21/massachusetts-police-facial-recognition-rules">WBUR.</a>

On Tuesday, the Joint Committee on the Judiciary heard arguments on the proposals. “Facial recognition technology is dangerous, both in its ability to facilitate government surveillance, and its track record of misidentifying people in criminal investigations,” State Senator Cynthia Creem said to the panel.

Creem is sponsoring a bill that would require the police to get a warrant to use face biometrics to identify a suspect and inform defendants they were identified through the software. “I think that’s called protecting one’s civil rights,” she said.

		Fake identities are driving a boom in financial fraud. A new study has shown that fraud involving AI-generated identities has risen 17 percent over the past two years, while more than two-thirds (76 percent) of financial professionals believe that their companies have approved customers using synthetic identities.

The research also reveals that 87 percent of experts anticipate the problem worsening before an effective solution is found. The survey interviewed 500 fraud and risk professionals with a minimum seniority of manager at financial services and fintech companies. The research was conducted by Wakefield and commissioned by U.S. synthetic identity fraud prevention company <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/deduce">Deduce</a>.

		AI-generated faces are becoming so realistic that people often can’t detect whether or not they are human.

A new study has revealed that AI-made faces of white people may appear especially realistic, with humans choosing them more often as real faces than actual human faces. And while humans seem unable to tell apart real faces from fake ones, a machine learning system developed by the researchers proved it can complete the task with 94 percent accuracy.

During the experiment, 124 participants tried to determine which of the faces they were shown were machine-made. Participants judged 66 percent of <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202202/despite-facial-recognition-misgivings-we-seem-ready-to-trust-synthetic-faces">AI-generated faces<

The period between Black Friday and Christmas is a bonanza for U.S. retailers as it contributes over <a href="https://www.zippia.com/advice/black-friday-statistics/">13 percent</a> of all retail sales. Shoppers spent $9 billion online during Black Friday in 2022. However, this growth in online retailing hides two challenges; high volume of returns and growing fraud.
