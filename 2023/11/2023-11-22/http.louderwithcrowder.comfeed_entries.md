	Every year for Thanksgiving, we're bombarded with think pieces and other clickbait about fighting with your family members over politics at Thanksgiving. The Obama Campaign started it by sending your obnoxious leftist cousin home with talking points about Obamacare. It snowballed from there. The worst was <a href="https://apnews.com/deb5250314a44feea5aaa36150b479fe" target="_blank">this "etiquette" "expert" from a few years ago</a>.</p><blockquote><em>“I do think it's healthy for people to express themselves and to have those conversations," said Swann, who will host her family's Thanksgiving. “My advice is to take a route to allow some sort of platform, but with guidelines."One tactic: sequester the debates. She'll have a room away from the dining table stocked with snacks for people who want to talk politics. She also sugg

One involves a bottle of Pappy I partake in once a year. I sit on the porch with bourbon and a cigar and reflect on the things for which I am most thankful. Mostly bourbon. And <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/protestor-tackled-by-nun" target="_blank">content</a>. Sweet, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/just-stop-oil-stag-party" target="_blank">sweet content</a>. I drink my way through whatever lame football matchups are on and wonder what kind of a God would force his children to sit through Joe Buck talking. At some point, I eat. This year I'll be skipping the Thanksgiving Turkey and instead be making the Thanksgiving Waygu Tri-Tip, smoked over mesquite wood.  Try not to be jealous while pretending Aunt Bertha's turkey isn't dry AF.</p><p>But the day is always star

These are a few of my favorite things.</p><p>White was a guest on Bussin' with the Boys. His broader point about successful people not listening to critics is important. I believe it was Kierkegaard, or maybe it was Nick Hexum, who said, "f*ck the naysayers 'cuz they don't mean a thing."</p><p>And the style the media brings is that of people who earn every poll that names them the least trusted institution in America.</p><p>"If the media tells you you have something that's going to fail, it's definitely gonna f*cking win," c
