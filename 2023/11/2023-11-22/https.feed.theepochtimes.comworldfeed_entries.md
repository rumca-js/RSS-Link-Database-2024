TO GO WITH ADVANCER STORY BY ROBIN MILLARD
(FILES) A file picture take March 19, 2007 shows a Union Flag flyinf over Stanley, in the Falkland Islands. The Falkland Islands will vote in a referendum on March 10 and 11, 2013 which residents hope will send a crystal-clear message to Argentina and the world about their strong desire to stay British. In a move instigated by residents of the barren archipelago themselves, the 1,672 eligible voters are being asked specifically whether they want the Falklands to retain their status as an internally self-governing British overseas territory.  They hope the outcome will provide a slap in the face to an increasingly bellicose Argentinian President Cristina Kirchner, who has been ramping up the diplomatic tension with London over Buenos Aires' long-held sovereignty claims.
