  <p id="8xwbWs">Apple started using OLED screens in the iPhone X back in 2017, and before that, in the first Apple Watch. And the Touch Bar, of course (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/31/23938841/apple-macbook-pro-touch-bar-discontinued-proof-of-concept">RIP</a>).

  <p id="WtYWZf">Many Threads users are now saying they have the ability to opt out of having their posts shown on Instagram and Facebook. To keep Threads posts from showing up Meta’s <em>other</em> platforms, tap the two lines in the top right of the Threads app &gt; Privacy &gt; Suggesting posts on other apps — two switches let users turn off suggestions on Instagram or Facebook.
