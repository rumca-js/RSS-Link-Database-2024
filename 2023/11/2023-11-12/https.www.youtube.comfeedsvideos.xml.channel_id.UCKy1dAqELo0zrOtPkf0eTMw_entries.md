Rick and Morty is already halfway through Season 7 but Co-Creator Dan Harmon and Executive Producer Scott Marder tell us the show is about to return to the big story thatâ€™s been cooking in the background all this time. Will Rick catch up with Rick Prime? Will their ensuing conflict destroy the multiverse? Harmon and Marder dive into the messed-up psyche of Rick C-137 plus how they balance writing the fun Rick and Morty one-off episodes with the episodes dealing with that larger story.
