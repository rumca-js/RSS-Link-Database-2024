But it seems like some people in Washington are a bit confused as the purpose of elected officials is to protect our freedoms. I don't remember reading anywhere in our founding documents that the government is supposed to promote gender ideology. </p><p>Do you think promoting one radical ideology over the other actually trumps our natural right to religious freedom? </p><p>Sens. Marco Rubio and JD Vance sent a <a href="https://www.rubio.senate.gov/rubio-vance-criticize-u-s-census-bureau-for-pushing-gender-identity-question/" target="_blank">letter </a>to U.S. Census

It's where Matt Damon went in a janitor and came out a really smart masshole. Sadly, as we see with <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/harbard-israel-hamas-protest" target="_blank">other once-respected schools</a>, it's nothing more than another woke antisemitism factory. And the viral video of a math class being interrupted isn't the worst of it.</p><p>$250,000 so your math class can be interrupted by a pro-Hamas advocate screaming nonsense comes with the territory of going to an "elite" university. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/mit-woke-mentality" target="_blank">MIT alumni tried to warn about the woke mind virus</a>. No one listened. This is what you get:</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twi

As it turns out, something CAN be done about it. The problem is the government chooses NOT to do something unless there's a good reason to. Like, not wanting to embarrass themselves in front of Chinese President Xi as Joe Biden is summoned to meet with him.</p><p>To set the stage, a video had gone viral on (ironically enough) TikTok illustrating what a sh*thole San Fran is. This is what the city looked like on November 6th.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
