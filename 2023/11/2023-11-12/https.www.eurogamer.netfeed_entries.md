</p><p>The issue &ndash; which has been around for some time now &ndash; chiefly affects players on the Colosseo map, and sees players get trapped. Without the help of characters like Lifeweaver of Mei's movement abilities to bump them out of position, they'll stay trapped, too.
</p><p>Despite many players reporting they've also been stuck in this exact spot as a myriad of different players, it doesn't look like Blizzard's yet been able to address the problem.

## You'll need nerves (and a stomach) of steel to play this Flat2VR mod for Amnesia: The Dark Descent!

Traditional flat horror games can be scary, sure, but there's always a safety blanket there. Because you're watching the action play out on a screen in front of you a slight turn of your head will break the illusion. Suddenly you're back in your room, safe from whatever is lurking inside your monitor.</p><p>The same cannot be said for VR however. Turn your head in a VR horror game and there'll be no blanket for you, only the possibility of more nightmares come to life, charging at you from out of the shadows...</p><p>Which leads me to this week's epsiode of Ian's VR Corner, in which I play a flatscreen to VR mod for perhaps one of the scariest games ever made, Amnesia: The Dark Descent.

I've always been fascinated by Devil World, a game that Shigeru Miyamoto made for the Famicom back in the early 1980s. It was, I gather, his first game made exclusively for a console. Devil World's a spin on Pac-Man, but one that never made it to the West because it used a lot of religious imagery. Devils, sure, but also bibles and crosses. It's always sounded weird and intriguing.
</p><p>
Now, Devil World has finally landed on the Nintendo Switch, and I've been playing it on and off for the last few days. It's certainly a little strange to see a Nintendo game in which you collect bibles and get powered-up by crosses, and looking back at a screenshot I took which has a huge crucifix for the player to navigate I did feel the vaguest frisson of something or other. But the iconography is far from the most interesting thing about t
