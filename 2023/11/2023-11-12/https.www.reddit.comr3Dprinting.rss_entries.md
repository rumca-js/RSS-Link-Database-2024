The weird part is that a 2 walled test tower (4 vertical sides) I printed to check for layer lines is way better and is smoother, despite being much less stable (smaller footprint) and not being much less complex.</p> <p>Could this be the extra layers and infill of the large object compared to the thin tower?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; subm

Due to inferior print settings, the hub index that attaches to the shaft failed long before the blades did. The whole prop assembly is still in tact aside from a few chips on the tip of the blades.
