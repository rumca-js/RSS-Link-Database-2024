In the last episode, we have shown that at the depths of Xi Jinping's mind, he believes in the Divine and Buddha, fate, dragon chakra, prophecy, etc. On the other hand, the guiding ideology of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is Marxism-Leninism. As the party leader, can Xi Jinping be free from such influence? Xi is a second-generation Red or the offspring of the first-generation CCP revolutionaries. The "Red" kingdom was built by Xi's father's generation. Now that Xi has taken it over, the "Red" kingdom cannot change color in his hands. Therefore, he has a very strong conviction to preserve the CCP.
