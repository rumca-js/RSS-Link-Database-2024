Matchdays at Stamford Bridge these days dawn with a curious mixture of fascination and foreboding: roughly akin to the sensation of sitting down in a restaurant that has a 3.3 rating on Google Maps.

A sense of stylistic progress? An unchanged starting XI?</p><p>In this respect, it was tempting to suggest that these 104 minutes of football changed little: for all the thrills and plot twists, the deflections and the chaotic counter-attacks and the 20-yard slide tackles in the teeming rain.

<p>How hot should a hot drink be? And is it time to dilute your herbal tea with some cold water?</p><p>To be clear about something: hot drinks are great. They break the working day into manageable chunks, give friends something to bond over that isn’t booze, and provide a tiny form of kindness that almost anyone can offer to anyone else. When James “The Scrounger” Garner suggests having a cup of tea to Donald “The Forger” Pleasance in The Great Escape, he isn’t just hankering for some super-heated tannins – he is offering a hand across the transatlantic cultural divide, and telling him that everything is going to be OK. Putting the kettle on is probably good for you in a lot of little ways.

No compromise”. On social media, Zapp wrote: “All excited and ready for the next chapter! Live life unplugged.”</p><p>Six months on, the stock has hit the skids, and now has a market cap of $12.5m, according to the Nasdaq, and Zapp looks increasingly like it will join a host of British vehicle companies which have seen their US listing turn into an investors’ short stay car park.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.c

<p>(Warner)<br />The Londoner’s highly anticipated debut album is strongest when playing to millennial nostalgia while giving Gen Z something new</p><p>In 2021, a handful of musical clips uploaded by the user <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@pinkpantheress?lang=en">PinkPantheress</a> went viral on TikTok. They gained millions of views thanks to the anonymous producer’s infectious blend of throwback UK garage beats and speak-sung vocals. It gradually emerged that a 20-year-old London student was behind those tracks. After a major label signing, PinkPantheress (who has kept her name private) has since produced a Billboard Top 10 hit earlier this year with single <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oftolPu9qp4">Boy’s a Liar Pt 2</a>.</p><p>Her debut album is thus one of the most hotly anticipated of 2023 – and it delivers, in parts.

Her hit memoir <em>Everything I Know About Love</em> distilled lessons learned the messy way in her 20s about romance in all its guises, and when she later published <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/oct/21/ghosts-by-dolly-alderton-review-a-sharp-eyed-debut">her debut novel, </a><em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/oct/21/ghosts-by-dolly-alderton-review-a-sharp-eyed-debut">Ghosts</a></em>, its plot felt tantalisingly autobiographical, centring on a successful young writer’s app-enhanced attempts at finding a lasting relationship. <em>Good Material</em> is her second novel and it allows Alderton to reflect on heartbreak-as-muse while simultaneously propelling her into a more definitively fictional realm, narrated as it

The stories people tell me about their lives can be funny, surprising, tragic or shocking – and some stay with me for years<p>I can distinctly remember being in the back seat of the family car on a long journey (to Devon probably – that drive felt interminable), looking at all the other cars full of people and thinking, “Where on earth are they all going and why?” As my eyes went funny trying to keep up with the traffic flicking past, it blew my mind to imagine everyone as the main character in the dramas of their own lives, with a busy morning behind them and a plan for the afternoon ahead. It’s a thought which has never really left me. As a middle-aged woman, one of my ideas of top entertainment is to people-watch. You’ll find me at it in cafés, bars, on trains. I’m completely contented when I’m losing myself in the passing tide of main characters, imagining the scenes of their lives unfurling around them. The only thing that can beat it is to take the extra step and strike up a co

Writer-director Amanda Kramer’s kitsch exploration of fame lust will categorically not be for everyone.</p><p>It stars Sophie von Haselberg (daughter of Bette Midler) as showbiz trouper Sissy St Claire, a variety performer who has been given her very own TV special. She fills it with what she does best: song, dance, skits and self-celebration. To canned applause, Sissy compares herself to Jesus – they share, she claims, an iconic look and an unshakable commitment to “making it”. But the peppy sparkle of her stage persona starts to lose its shine as the show unravels.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/nov/12/give-me-pity-review-a-psychedelic-drama-of-80s-fame-lust-amanda-k

<p>Chilean journalist Augusto Góngora and actor-politician Paulina Urrutia navigate his memory loss with warmth and tenderness in this wrenchingly sad documentary</p><p>The framework of a marriage – the shared past, the certainties, even the love itself – is put under unimaginable strain when one half of it, former journalist and broadcaster Augusto Góngora, is diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease. This tender, profoundly moving Chilean documentary is an intimate study of the strategies that Góngora and his wife, the actor and politician Paulina Urrutia, put in place to cope with the attrition of his memories. With warmth and patience, Paulina painstakingly walks her husband through the increasingly tangled mental maze of his past, signposting key moments and facts for him to cling to: his achievements as a reporter; his wide circle of friends and family (“They love me very much,” he repeats like a mantra, in an attempt to stave off the clouds of confusion).</p><p>The latest film from

<p>Western nations are caught in a low-growth trap, with tricky political choices to make – but there is a way out </p><p>The past 15 years have been the most difficult for western economies since the 1920s and 1930s. Public anger has risen as living standards have been squeezed by a prolonged period of weak growth. American politics is as ugly as it has ever been, while <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/30/far-right-on-the-march-europe-growing-taste-for-control-and-order">parties of the far right </a>have emerged as powerful political forces in Germany, Italy, Austria, Finland, France and Sweden.</p><p>The new age of anger is a far cry from the six decades between 1948 and 2008.

As temperatures begin to fall, comfort and spice warm up the kitchen<p>I am not yet ready for the slow blip-blip of a simmering casserole or the puttering of a steamed sponge pudding on the hob. Full-on winter cooking can just back off for a few weeks. Yet there is no denying the season is marching on a pace and I find myself needing spicy, smoky notes in my main dishes and a level of comfort-cooking in my desserts that no seasonal fruit alone can offer.</p><p>This wet autumn – will it ever stop raining? – has given me a fancy for oily fish, its skin toasted and smoky from time spent under a hot grill. I can rarely resist a shining mackerel on the fishmonger’s ice, but a more sustainable choice, and just as delicious, is herring. The best of this week’s fish dinners (there have been a couple) were those where our catch had been grilled with a mustard and harissa paste, the fish taking on a glossy golden sheen from the dressing in the heat.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/foo

Scientists believe that within five to 10 years, “in silico” trials – in which hundreds of virtual organs are used to assess the safety and efficacy of drugs – could become routine, while patient-specific organ models could be used to personalise treatment and avoid medical complications.</p><p>Digital twins are computational models of physical objects or processes, updated using data from their real-world counterparts. Within medicine, this means combining vast amounts of data about the workings of genes, proteins, cells and whole-body systems with patients’ personal data to create virtual models of their organs – and eventually, potentially their entire body.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian

The idea was to stay for a short period during the construction work, but de Just was won over by the landscape, climate, spontaneity and luminosity of Rio. Today, a confirmed resident of the city, he shares a 1950s apartment in Ipanema with his boyfriend, also an architect, Laurent Croissandeau.</p><p>The couple chose to move to an older building in Ipanema – and to retain as many of its original characteristics as possible, particularly the solid wood parquet flooring, high ceilings and retro kitchen.

He doesn’t want to break my £20, so gives me another scarf – one of those 50/50 jobs reviled by snobby fans like myself – to make up the extra £5. This should feel like a bargain, but since it actually suggests a more appropriate valuation of his wares, it does not.</p><p>My son is unconcerned and I tell myself that this impartial monstrosity will at least serve as a fittingly comprehensive memento of his first ever Premier League game.

Cookie chips can be nothing short of amazing<p>A few weeks ago, I spoke about baked goods in chocolate. <strong><a href="https://pumpstreetchocolate.com/#" title="">Pump Street</a></strong> were, if not the first, certainly one of the first to do this with their sourdough ‘waste’ mixed into chocolate. Now there’s a new bar from them which is very much nothing short of amazing. The <a href="https://pumpstreetchocolate.com/products/cookie-chip-60" title="">Cookie Chip</a> (£6.75, 70g) is part of its Bakery Series. It’s chocolate chip cookie ‘baked to a caramelised crisp’ and enrobed in 60% Ecuadorian cocoa chocolate. It also heralds Pump Street’s new packaging, which is based on the ‘Suffolk pink’ of the bakery. A worthy entry into any Christmas stocking.</p><p><strong>Lumi</strong>’s caramelised nut milk chocolate bar is its worthy bestseller and now has a dark (ergo vegan) counterpart in the form of the <a href="https://lumichocolate.co.uk/product/the-vegan-nuts/" title="">Vegan Nuts

As we remember the armistice, let’s celebrate contributions from the Commonwealth<p>A welcome and solemn silence will again fall on Whitehall and Westminster and across the airwaves of the nation at 11 o’clock this morning. Yesterday, two minutes of calm stilled, briefly, the sharp arguments about war and peace, protest and prejudice that dominated the political week – which had created a largely false impression that clashes over Remembrance can tear us apart.</p><p>The 11 November 1918 armistice was officially only a ceasefire. So formal celebrations of peace had to <a href="https://www.nam.ac.uk/explore/peace-and-commemoration" title="">await the 1919 treaty of Versailles</a>, marked by Peace Day that summer, with a temporary wood and plaster cenotaph as a centrepiece.

Tony Adams, Alex Ferguson and Kenny Dalglish are all here, and so is Howard Wilkinson, the chairman of the League Managers Association, who showed Cooper around the FA’s national football centre in Staffordshire, and introduced her to the England manager, Gareth Southgate. Alas, she doesn’t say what she and Southgate discussed on that great day; having read <em>Tackle!</em>, I detect that she has strong views on the quality of the catering in football boardrooms, so perhaps they talked avidly of flaky pastry. But she does note that “many years later”, Southgate was kind enough to send her a signed England shirt, together with a note congratulating her on having finally finished writing her book.</p><p>Was this novel – her

Edel Rodriguez does, and that’s one more reason why he, a Cuban American political cartoonist, was so disturbed by what happened in his adopted homeland on January 6.</p><p>Rodriguez grew up in the shadow of a different sort of insurgency, the revolution that swept Fidel Castro to power in January 1959. He knew what it was like for a people to lose their freedoms under a dictatorship, and he knew the resulting desire to seek liberty, which he and his family did in the Mariel boatlift in 1980. So after 2016, when Donald Trump won the White House, uncomfortable memories from the not-so-distant past began to surface, never more so than on 6 January 2021.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/nov/12/edel-rodriguez-worm-trump-cartoonist-memoir-book">Continue r

A fun way to discover new products or revisit favourites, a beauty advent calendar can save you money, too<p>I understand the allure of discovering a potentially gamechanging beauty product. Especially when it happens daily. Hence, beauty advent calendars are so fun. The gift that keeps on giving and all that. But they can be super expensive and, right now, splurging does feel overindulgent. Thankfully, I’m noticing a wider breadth of options and price points. And if you do the maths, you’ll find that buying an advent calendar is much more economically efficient than buying the products individually (for instance, Cult Beauty’s retails at £225 but is actually worth more than £1,000). So the calendars here have been chosen with all the above in mind. They offer great products and brands (the Body Shop doesn’t get enough of a shout-out – I am yet to find a body butter that beats theirs), they are all cleverly curated, and this is a once-in-a-year opportunity to get beauty products at a

Indeed, when you speak to some winemakers, you get the impression they feel it’s almost a failure if their wines taste too obviously of barrels, and many will talk up their use of alternative, more discreet vessels: concrete, clay, stainless steel, or what’s known as ‘neutral oak’, which refers to barrels that have been used for so many vintages they no longer impart the flavours or tannins they did when they were new. I can understand why: ham-fistedly oak-aged whites are among the least attractive of mouthfuls, with any fruit smothered by a sensation of liquid sawdust
