Every year, thousands of high school graduates enroll in military academies and colleges, committing to four years of an intense military lifestyle filled with physical challenges and mental discipline. It's a completely different experience than that of most of their peers who choose traditional colleges. And in the case of military service academies like West Point and the U.S. Naval Academy, attending those schools comes with a contract to serve in the armed forces for years after graduation.

Some young people choose to attend military colleges like The Citadel and The Virginia Military Institute that don't require a commitment to serve. For the last five years, Business Insider has gone inside these institutions to see what it's like on the first day when these high school graduates take the first step of their military college experiences.
