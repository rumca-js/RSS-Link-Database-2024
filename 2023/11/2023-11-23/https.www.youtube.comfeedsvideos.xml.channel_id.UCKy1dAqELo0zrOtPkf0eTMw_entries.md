## Sonic Superstars is Good, But Itâ€™s Not Classic Sonic

With Sonic Dream Team on its way, letâ€™s take a look back at Sonicâ€™s latest adventure in Sonic Superstars. Sonic Superstars is the latest Sonic game unleashed into the wild, with claims of being a thrilling new take on the Classic Sonic experience. After having spent an extensive amount of time with the game, Sonic Superstars is missing quite a few elements that truly encapsulates Classic Sonic in the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise. #SonicSuperstars is good, but the way it handles boss battles, special stages, and the chaos emeralds feels like a misrepresentation of Classic Sonic, especially when you compare it to how Sonic Maniaâ€”the BEST modern representation of Classic Sonicâ€”handled those same gameplay elements. This is Akeemâ€™s detailed opinion on Sonic Superstars, how it holds up to the other classic Sonic games, and maybe if itâ€™s better than Sonic Mania.

Want to know how to fix the Metal Gear Solid Master Collection with mods? We've got you covered with our selection of the best MGS Master Collection mods for PC!

It's safe to say that the Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Volume 1 was disappointing, lacking further enhancements compared to the Metal Gear Solid HD Collection released by Bluepoint Games in 2011. This brand new compilation of remastered ports is missing custom resolutions, ultra-widescreen support, FOV fixes, features lower quality audio, and much more.

So, how do we go about fixing that? Well, with mods, of course! MGS PC mods such as the MGSM2Fix, MGSHDFix, and other projects, allow us to breathe some new life into the MGS trilogy, while also introducing new features such as the MGS 3 Snake Eater crouch walking, something that was exclusive to the Nintendo 3DS Remake!
