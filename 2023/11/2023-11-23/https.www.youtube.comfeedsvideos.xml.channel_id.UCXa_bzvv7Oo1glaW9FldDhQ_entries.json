While it starts interestingly enough, everything falls apart in short order.\n\nChoppy performance, lack of quality-of-life features (even something as simple as navigating menus with the D-pad), terrible aiming, numerous bugs and opportunities to get soft-locked all abound. That's not including the characters and dialogue, which are at odds with the story's overall tone at best and embarrassing at worst, or the rote level design.\n\nMicroids could fix all its bugs and glitches, but Flashback 2's problems are more ingrained. It fails to live up to the original's legacy but isn't even a passable side-scroller/shoot 'em up in its own right.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6cjnbtbaog", "date_published": "2023-11-23T17:30:03+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "GamingBolt", "album": "GamingBolt", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/Z6cjnbtbaog/hqdefault.jpg", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "Mortal Kombat 1's MICROTRANSACTIONS Are Getting Out of Hand...", "description": "Time and time again, WB Games has incurred the ire of the gaming masses thanks to monetization practices that are frequently viewed as aggressive and predatory, with plenty of the publisher\u2019s major titles having been let down by such models in the last several years.
