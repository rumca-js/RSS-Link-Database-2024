The Second World War has left its mark on Japan, everything lies in ruins. After the proud nation has lost the war and is still mourning the dead after the atomic bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the next horror is already waiting for them. The primeval lizard Godzilla emerges unexpectedly from the depths of the sea and sets course for the destroyed country. If Japan had to start from scratch after the war, Godzilla throws the nation even further back - into the negative zone. Is there a way for the nameless survivors to fight back and survive?
