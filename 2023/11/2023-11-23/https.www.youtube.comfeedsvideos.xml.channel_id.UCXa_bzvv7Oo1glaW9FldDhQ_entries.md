Billed as a follow-up to the classic 1992 cinematic platformer, Flashback 2 offers a new story, 2.5D movement and combat, and some eye-catching 3D visuals. While it starts interestingly enough, everything falls apart in short order.

Choppy performance, lack of quality-of-life features (even something as simple as navigating menus with the D-pad), terrible aiming, numerous bugs and opportunities to get soft-locked all abound. That's not including the characters and dialogue, which are at odds with the story's overall tone at best and embarrassing at worst, or the rote level design.

Microids could fix all its bugs and glitches, but Flashback 2's problems are more ingrained. It fails to live up to the original's legacy but isn't even a passable side-scroller/shoot 'em up in its own right.
