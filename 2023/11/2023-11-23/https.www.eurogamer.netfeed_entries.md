American Truck Simulator rumbles ever-onward, and developer SCS Software has announced it'll be making its next stop, this time in the state of Kansas - the destination of its newest paid expansion - next Thursday, 30th November. Plus, its substantial 1.49 update - which adds a dynamic night sky, the moon, HDR skyboxes, and more - is out now.
</p><p>
Kansas was confirmed to be the focus of American Truck Simulator 's next, post-Oklahoma expansion back in February, bringing the tally of explorable states in the game up to 13th, joining California, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Oregon, Washington, Utah, Idaho, Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, Texas, and Oklahoma.

As families come together to gorge on turkey/give thanks for Doctor Who being 60, what better way to mark the occasion than with a bit of a (spacey) freebie from the Epic Games Store, specifically in the form of Deliver Us Mars?

Deliver Us Mars, if you're unfamiliar, is this year's sequel to developer KeokeN Interactive's 2018 sci-fi puzzle-adventure Deliver Us the Moon. For this secound outing, players step into the massive space clogs of an astronaut, Kathy, as she travels to the red planet in search of her missing father and technology that might just help save Earth from ecological disaster.

</p><p>
The report, conducted by Atomik Research for SuperScale's Good Games Don't Die and shared by Eurogamer's sister site <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/report-83-of-mobile-games-fail-in-the-three-years-after-launch">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, was based on interviews with 500 game developers, from both here in the UK and across the pond in the US. 
</p><p>
The report stated the majority of mobile games reached peak revenue within the first 12 months of their release. While 76 percent reach their peak revenue in the first year, only four percent peak in the second year of release.

Call of Duty: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/modern-warfare-3-best-guns-meta-mw3-warzone-9328">Modern Warfare 3</a> developer Sledgehammer Games has said it is "investigating" an exploit that allows players to wriggle around on the floor while prone at fast speeds.
</p><p>
It leaves you looking like some kind of human Call of Duty snake, but it also leaves you able to zoom around while lying prone - a very handy tactic for winning gunfights.
</p><p>
Now, Sledgehammer has taken notice and dubbed Call of Duty snaking as a PC exploit to be looked at further. "We're investigating an exploit that allows players to sprint while appearing in the prone animation," the developer <a href="https://twitter.com/CODUpdates/status/1727153876519018951">wrote</a> on the official CODUPdates account on X, formerly Twitter.

## The Witcher author Andrzej Sapkowski says Netflix "never listened" to his feedback

Andrzej Sapkowski may have penned The Witcher novels, which in turn inspired both CD Projekt Red's video game series and Netflix's TV adaptation, but that doesn't mean that the streaming service ever listened to his feedback.
</p><p>
While attending Vienna Comic Con, Sapkowski was asked about the various adaptations that have stemmed from his original works. Speaking with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHQtTiP068E">Cerealkillers</a>, the author said that every visual adaptation of his The Witcher series was "strange" for him to see, because as a writer he only uses his words.

"My raw material when I work, it's only letters. I do not describe pictures. I don't see any pictures. I use the letters only because I know that my reader will see in the book the letters only, not the pictures. So I have to do with my le

There's always the feeling that you're looking through a pair of binoculars, your view limited by the screens placed directly in front of your eyes. This is the problem the Pimax Crystal was designed to solve, with a huge field of view and more raw pixels than any other VR headset, but its $1599 asking price (<a href="https://pimax.com/product/pimax-crystal/?ref=digitalfoundry" rel="sponsored">currently reduced to $1440</a>) and steep system requirements raise questions about its viability. </p><p>After testing the Crystal for a few weeks, I have some answers. Though there are a lot of hoops to jump through - and some puzzling design choices - when the Crystal shines, it delivers perhaps the most stunning V

I swear that London used to have a palace situated on a bridge. I've been googling around this morning and I think I might have been thinking of Nonsuch House, which was on the old London Bridge. Four storeys and built in 1579, I've also just learned that Nonsuch House was the first recorded pre-fab building in history, having been built and then dismantled in the Netherlands and then shipped over to London where they put it back together again.
</p><p>
The reason I've been thinking about all this comes down to an old picture I once saw of London Bridge with this palace on it, and all these other buildings stacked around it too, fairly crowding off the bridge itself in every direction and hanging out over the water. It's exactly the kind of look that Pile Up! traffics in, and I'm getting quietly hooked on Pile Up! at the moment. (That sa
