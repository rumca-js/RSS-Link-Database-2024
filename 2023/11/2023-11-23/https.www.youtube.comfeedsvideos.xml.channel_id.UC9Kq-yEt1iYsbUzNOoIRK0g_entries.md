Nearly a decade after the release of The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 2 and the end of Katniss’s’s’ story, The Hunger Games are BACK, with an a kind-of-all-new tale about everyone’s least favorite tyrannical President, Corialanus Snow.

The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes definitely raises some questions. Like did they set out to make the longest title possible? How many times do they say Lucy Gray’s name and how many times does she sing? Are we rooting for the guy that runs the kids-killing-each-other competition? Why does this movie feel like two movies?

To answer all these questions, check out the pitch meeting that led to The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes!
