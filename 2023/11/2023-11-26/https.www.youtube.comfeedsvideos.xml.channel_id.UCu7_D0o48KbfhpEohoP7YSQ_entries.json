He built a simulator for all kinds of MCUs and electronic parts. This project is so cutting-edge that I cannot believe only one young guy was able to create it. And because it is useful and fun, I invite you to follow me.\n\nMy second channel: https://www.youtube.com/HB9BLAWireless\n\nLinks:\nWokwi: https://wokwi.com/\nThe Amp Hour #599: https://theamphour.com/599-an-interview-with-uri-shaked-wokwi-com/\nArduino Uno: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DmhyEeT\nESP32: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DF1tGcR\nESP32-S3: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_Dk2vq5Z\nATtiny85: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DcyoJYb\nPi  Pico: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DmDKiGn\n\nPatreon supporter companies:\nhttps://passiv-energie.gmbh/\nhttps://www.welectron.com/\nhttps://yosmart.com/\nYouTuber Patreon: https://www.youtube.com/@MakersMashup/\n\nThe links above are usually affiliate links that support the channel (a", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l9DWqb77KI", "date_published": "2023-11-26T08:00:07+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "Andreas Spiess", "album": "Andreas Spiess", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/6l9DWqb77KI/hqdefault.jpg", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}]
