</p><p>The <a href="https://jobs.careers.microsoft.com/global/en/job/1662143/multiplayer-playlist-designer">recruitment advertisement</a>, which went live earlier this week, makes a clear connection between the success of the sci-fi shooter's multiplayer game and the ability to "work directly" with the Halo community and players who make their own maps and assets in its map-making mode, Forge.
</p><p>"In this role you'll design, implement, and manage playlists that align with the needs of Halo Infinite. You'll work with partner teams to ensure content (maps and modes) is properly represented in our playlists and aligns with scheduled game events," the ad explains.

</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/353/G035315/20231119003/">4Gamer.net</a> (日本語) and shared by Genki, Saito said that while another Nier game would be coming, the duo was currently working on a "separate" project, and teased that we can expect to hear more about that unannounced game next year.
</p><p>The news came via "a meeting to talk incessantly about the production of Nier Automata" presentation at the Korean video game show G-STAR 2023 &ndash; yes, I love the title, too &ndash; in which Saito talked about the development of the original game and hinted at what lay ahead for the fan-favourite series.

</p><p>The free-to-play third-person action-shooter spin-off was announced in May 2021 and was initially set to release in 2021-22. Ubisoft has since been taciturn about the game's release window, but the rating &ndash; which was published earlier this month &ndash; intimates that we could be getting a firm release date soon.
</p><p>Because of "violence, inappropriate language", and "anti-society" leanings &ndash; make of that what you will &ndash; the shooter has been awarded a PG-15 rating on PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X, and Xbox One.

## PlayStation Portal review: impressive hardware but is Remote Play itself good enough?

PlayStation Portal is an interesting gadget, an official, Sony-designed streaming device designed for Remote Play with PS5. It's not a console or a gaming handheld in the traditional sense, which makes reviewing it a little challenging as the quality of the experience is entirely dependent on the quality of your home network. Take on board some simple advice and it's relatively easy to get the best out of Remote Play and therefore the best out of PlayStation Portal - but there's still the sense that Remote Play itself isn't as good as it should be. 
</p><p>
My recommendations for optimal conditions for PlayStation Portal starts with setting up a hard link between your PS5 and your router via a LAN cable. You see, there are two steps to data transfer between Portal and console: firstly, the console communicates with your router

</p><p>As first reported by our friends at <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/gabe-newell-ordered-to-make-in-person-deposition-for-valve-v-wolfire-games-lawsuit">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, Wolfire Games &ndash; which <a href="https://cases.justia.com/federal/district-courts/washington/wawdce/2:2021cv00563/298754/170/0.pdf">filed the order</a> earlier this month &ndash; brought an antitrust lawsuit against the megacorp back in 2021. Whilst Newell requested a remote deposition due to health concerns, admitting he has "structured his life to minimise exposure to possible COVID-19 transmission", Wolfire insists that there is "insubstantial evidence to suggest that he is at particularised risk of serious illness" and wants hi

Years ago, one of my university lecturers told me that he didn't really read much that he enjoyed anymore - I suspect he'd been marking one of my essays - but there was a line of poetry he had read the other day that he thought was phenomenal. He then said it out loud, and what I remember him saying was just part of a sentence, just this:
</p><p>
"In winter, when the wolves have nothing to eat but wind..."
</p><p>
I have not been able to track this line down since, so I've almost certainly gotten it wrong. What I will never forget, though, was the way he stressed those three main W words that give the thought its shape and force. Winter, wolves, wind. Each of these was pained, almost: bleached and pummeled tight by the ferocity of the cold as they left his mouth. I was transported by the impromptu performance. I still am. Thank you,
