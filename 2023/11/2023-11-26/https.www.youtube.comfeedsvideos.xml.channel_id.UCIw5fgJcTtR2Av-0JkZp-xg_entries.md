Remixed on the Sonicware SmplTrek with Korg Nanokey Studio

John Connor: No, no, no, no. You gotta listen to the way people talk. You don't say "affirmative" or some shit like that. You say "no problemo". And if someone comes up to you with an attitude, you say "eat me". And if you want to shine them on, it's "hasta la vista, baby".
T-800: Hasta la vista, baby.
