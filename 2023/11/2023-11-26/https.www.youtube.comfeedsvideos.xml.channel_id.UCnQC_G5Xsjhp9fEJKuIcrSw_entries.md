In the wake of the devastating Hamas attacks on October 7th, we were joined by a figure central to Israeli politics and international diplomacy, Naftali Bennett. Bennett has been a dynamic figure in Israeli politics. His journey is marked by a transition from a high-achieving soldier in the Israel Defense Forces' elite Sayeret Matkal and Maglan units, to a successful tech entrepreneur. As the 13th Prime Minister of Israel, and later the Alternate Prime Minister, Bennett navigated through tumultuous times, marking his tenure with significant decisions on domestic and international fronts. 

In this episode, we discussed the events of October 7th and the ongoing war in an attempt to understand their implications on the future of Israel and the Middle East.
