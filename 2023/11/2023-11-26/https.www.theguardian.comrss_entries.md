<p>The brilliant man-manager built great collectives and his vision of the game was fuelled by entrepreneurial spirit and self-belief</p><p>There was the club singing career. The series of detective novels. The clothes shop in Chelsea. The board game. The range of women’s wigs. The chain of pubs. The ticket agency. And then there was the football, in all its guises: player, coach, manager, chief executive, owner, adviser, pundit. Terry Venables wanted to do it all, and it was the making of him, and it was the breaking of him.</p><p>He was an only child with a short attention span and a ruthless personal ambition, and yet he was a people person at heart, a valued companion and a brilliant man‑manager who built great footballing collectives. He was a businessman and a romantic, a man steeped in football tradition who nonetheless saw the sport as a branch of the entertainment industry. He wanted to be famous and he wanted to be wealthy and he wanted to be loved and he wanted to win.</p>

<p>He allowed England players to flourish but his legacy was tarnished by his sometimes dubious business dealings</p><p>Terry Venables was so popular with the Euro 96 generation that senior England players consistently argued for his return to the nation’s radioactive tracksuit. Glenn Hoddle sacked? “Bring Terry back”. Kevin Keegan quits in the Wembley toilets? “Get Venners in again”.</p><p>There are only echoes of it now, but for decades after 1966 English football was racked by ideological struggle over how the national game should be played. The Route One-ists favoured howitzer football: native aggression and directness with minimal elaboration. Idealists fought for the global mainstream of sophistication. In the middle of this battle stood Terence Frederick Venables, a myth to his enemies, a prophet without honour in his own land to his disciples.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/nov/26/terry-venables-the-coach-who-saved-english-football-from-insularity">Con

<p>Everton burned with a sense of injustice over the record 10-point deduction that has revived relegation fears just when it seemed Sean Dyche’s side had left them behind. Manchester United performed with cool heads and cold intent instead, and savoured their biggest victory of the season as a result.</p><p>Erik ten Hag’s team’s previous seven league wins this season had been by a single goal margin but here they ran out comfortable victors, eventually, over an Everton team reeling from the heaviest sporting sanction in Premier League history. A stupendous overhead kick from Alejandro Garnacho set United on their way to an impressive win, in which the 18-year-old Kobbie Mainoo excelled on his full debut, before a second-half penalty from Marcus Rashford took the contest away from the hosts. Anthony Martial added the gloss with his first goal of the season late on.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/nov/26/everton-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report">Con

The end of the world is averted when the computer, known as Joshua, learns, after playing tic-tac-toe with the teenager, that nuclear war cannot have a winner. The insight causes him to rescind missile launch orders with the comment: “A strange game. The only winning move is not to play.”</p><p>Joshua embodied the idea that a superintelligent AI would have an anthropomorphic mindset.

## Ollie Watkins delivers clinical edge in Villa win and third straight loss for Spurs

<p>Sometimes it is easy to be led by the scoreboard. This was a pulsating battle between two clubs energised by smart managerial appointments and there is a temptation to argue that the turning point came when Unai Emery was able to regroup from a position of relative comfort at half-time. Far too astute to be fooled by Pau Torres equalising after a spell of blistering football from Tottenham, Emery was proactive during the break and there is no doubt that Aston Villa were far more effective after introducing Youri Tielemans and Leon Bailey at the start of the second half.</p><p>The decisiveness was telling, not least because it was Tielemans who played the pass that enabled Ollie Watkins to put a disappointing display for England behind him and score the goal that lifted Villa two points off the top of the table. Yet while Watkins’s winner meant Emery’s side set a new club record of 22 Premier League wins in a calendar year, this was a game that could easily have gone either way. Ta

Emma Hayes’s side got off to a rapid start with an early goal from Lauren James and an own goal from Courtney Nevin.

James and Aggie Beever-Jones added two further goals in the second half to make sure of the three points.</p><p>The Blues returned to Kingsmeadow for the first time in almost a month, backed by a strong contingent of spectators.

<p>Music, theatre and art have been crushed by years of Tory cuts. They need to be nurtured again, with purpose and with pride</p><p>As the Conservatives clutch at political straws, the Labour party is readying itself for government. Some predict a general election as early as next spring. In Thangam Debbonaire – who started out as a professional cellist – there is the unusual prospect of a culture secretary who understands the arts from deep personal experience. Two months into her job shadowing the unimpressive incumbent, Lucy Frazer, she is in listening mode. The next step is to get herself a serious, ambitious plan for power.</p><p>As Labour culture secretary, she would almost certainly score easy points by just not being Tory.

<p><strong>Bridgewater Hall, Manchester</strong><br />From James Lee III’s vivid exploration of Martin Luther King to an electrifying performance of Nielsen’s fourth, this was an evening to lift even the most downtrodden spirits</p><p>Amid the daily reports of man’s inhumanity to man, it was a welcome relief to spend two hours in Manchester’s Bridgewater Hall with this life-affirming programme from the BBC Philharmonic under chief conductor John Storgårds. The UK premieres of two BBC commissions, flanked by Copland’s rousing Fanfare for the Common Man and Nielsen’s titanic intrepid Fourth Symphony – “The Inextinguishable” – offered plenty of intellectual red meat and enough adrenalin-charged jollies to lift the most downtrodden spirits.</p><p>James Lee III likes to contemplate contemporary issues through the prism of history.

I stood out as different in Llandudno but by learning about its past and mine, it became the home I love<p>Looking back, a good deal of my younger years seemed to be perched somewhere between if only and my fate. If only my hair was straight, if only my bum was flatter, if only our house was ordinary, if only mum didn’t speak Welsh, if only dad could settle in Wales, if only I lived somewhere else, anywhere, anywhere but here. I often felt just too big for my world, out of place. Suspended on a faultline of creative adaptation, I invented Tessa. Tessa was blonde and white and lovely, and she lived somewhere in my dreamscape. She provided me with a lot of comfort in my small girl days, an escape from an odd reality. This may be a known story by now, the story of rural assimilation, mixed-race psychic angst and adaptation, but in fact the story was never about me, or my escape from being me. It is really a story about Wales.</p><p>I grew up in the 1960s in Llandudno in North Wales, a s

<p><strong>Queen Elizabeth Hall, London<br /></strong>Armatrading’s first symphony, premiered by Chineke! conducted by Andrew Grams, was underdeveloped and dull. Neither composer nor ensemble come out well from this</p><p></p><p>Even pop geniuses have a patchy record when it comes to writing for an orchestra. For every success (a Jonny Greenwood or a Randy Newman, for instance) there is at least one dud (a Paul McCartney, a Sufjan Stevens, a Deep Purple). Sadly, on the evidence of the world premiere of her first symphony, Joan Armatrading is very much in the latter category: a brilliant pop melodist who somehow turns cloth-eared when trying to write for an orchestra.</p><p>It’s difficult to see what Armatrading was trying to achieve with her half-hour composition, written in four movements. It features a handful of aimless, glib melodies, played almost entirely in unison. There is little harmony, no counterpoint, no tension and no sense of development. It’s difficult to believe that

<p>The activist and writer of the Vagina Monologues has no intention of stopping her quest to end violence against women</p><p>The new book by V – the playwright formerly known as Eve Ensler – is called <em>Reckoning</em>. She says the word slowly, as if it’s falling downstairs, or perhaps, was pushed. During Covid, “I started to really think about what it means to reckon with things. To really face them.” Before the pandemic she’d never had the time – reckoning, she realised, requires a certain stillness. Across the world, she saw people doing the same, as inequities, cruelties, memories, were rising to the surface and forcing uncomfortable confrontations. “And then I thought, what are the things I’ve reckoned with? What are the things I’ve been doing over this lifetime? How do they connect?”</p><p>For years, Ensler was an obscure New York poet and playwright, battling addiction and working in a homeless shelter. Her life shifted in 1996, aged 35, when her play <em>The Vagina Monolo

<p>Hearty herby butter beans and a frangipane tart add fragrance to an autumn day</p><p>A quiet autumn afternoon with fig leaves falling outside the kitchen window and, far away, the scent of a neighbour’s bonfire. A golden autumn day lacking only the smell of a baking cake or tart. I immediately put the omission to rights with an almond frangipane.</p><p>A deliberately plain shortcrust, buttery but unsweetened, was rolled out and ushered into a tart tin, then filled with a mixture of almonds, dark chocolate and glossy prunes. It was just as toothsome the following day. A thick slice of tart shared its plate with a mound of ice-cream; vanilla would have been my first choice, but stracciatella was to hand, its gravelly nuggets of chocolate and creamy vanilla producing a marriage with the almonds and prunes that was so, so good.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/nov/26/nigel-slater-recipes-fo-butter-beans-cannellini-and-cavolo-nero-and-chocolate-and-orange-frangipane">

<p>The popular press of 18th-century France is revealed as having sown the seeds of revolution in a convincing reframing of history</p><p>Revolutions, like bankruptcy, happen in two ways: gradually, then all at once. The French Revolution, according to Robert Darnton’s <em>The Revolutionary Temper: Paris, 1748-1789, </em>was no different. Histories of the period conventionally begin with the storming of the Bastille prison, hated symbol of royal tyranny, by Parisian commoners on 14 July 1789. Darnton, who built his reputation as an inventive, often iconoclastic historian in works such as <em>The Great Cat Massacre</em>, turns the conventional narrative upside down. Where other historians ask what made the revolution, looking to economics, ideology and outstanding personalities, <em>The Revolutionary Temper </em>asks<em> </em>what made the revolutionaries – and looks to the streets. Going back 50 years before 1789, Darnton tracks the transformation in values that led ordinary Parisian

A Tory chancellor telling the country it has “turned a corner”, while scattering around a few tax cuts when a general election is looming was not the only reason Jeremy Hunt’s bag of tricks felt so familiar. The sense of having been here before was heightened because of another aspect of his financial statement, a budget in all but name. The chancellor also flourished a “<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/autumn-statement-2023-speech" title="">plan for growth</a>”.</p><p>He spoke as if getting more out of the economy was a novel idea that had never occurred to anyone before, but his is the 12th growth plan the Tories have fanfared since 2010, which makes it one for almost every year they have been in power.

<p>Brian Graham’s shot of his friends in a Woodstock cabin in 1988 encapsulates romantic notions of the ​creative life</p><p>Brian Graham took this picture of two artists – Raoul Hague and Robert Frank – at Hague’s cabin on Old Maverick Road in Woodstock, New York, in 1988. Hague, an abstract sculptor working mainly in wood, was a friend and mentor to Frank, whose 1958 coast to coast journey, <em>The Americans</em>, had been a landmark in documentary photography. The picture is included in Graham’s new book, <em>Goin’ Down the Road </em><em>With Robert Frank</em>, about the photographer. Frank <a href="">died in 2019 aged 94</a>.</p><p>Graham’s memoir is a personal homage to Frank’s influence and an intimate pictorial history of his later years. Graham met the older photographer in the late 1970s when he had spent a couple of years working on oil rigs and was looking for a change of life. Frank bought him a camera and some film and subsequently worked with him for a decade “in and ou

With photographer Marta Syrko, he is sharing his story to battle stigma around disability</p><p>We have all met a young man like Daniil Melnyk, this open-faced, sunny 21-year-old with a disarming grin. As soon as he walks into the studio, in a former factory in Lviv in western Ukraine, the chat and jokes begin. Melnyk is used to being here. He has been photographed several times by the artist Marta Syrko. But he’s less used to having an audience in the room. As soon as everyone has introduced themselves, he and Syrko get to work. First, he pulls off his sweatshirt and trousers, revealing the heavily tattooed body of a young soldier. Then he removes his prosthetic legs: he has had two below-the-knee amputations. He lacks three of the fingers of his right hand.</p><p>Syrko has asked him to position himself on a sheet of reflective metal. She surveys him from different angles, suggesting

It may be trending now, but there’s nothing new about body care and the benefits it brings<p>The recent trend/obsession for body care – the act and the products – still remains bewildering to me. Not because I consider it a fad, quite the contrary; the three-step ritual of cleansing, exfoliating and moisturising your body is something I have practised from childhood and believe in. That it is now being marketed back at me as something new and innovative is what I find slightly ridiculous. Still, if this push encourages people to take care of their bodies, like their faces, then it’s not such a bad thing. While body exfoliating can feel like a faff (if you don’t want to use a scrub, just get a mesh sponge), the benefits are clear – it improves circulation and the texture of your skin is smoother and brighter. Moisturising is a no-brainer. But for a lot of people, it isn’t. While your body isn’t out much at this time of the year, I’d argue that it’s equally as important to care for the

There’s a habit, exacerbated by press and influencers, of always looking for the next big (or, for the fashion-conscious, small) thing, which in wine generally translates into talking up bottles made from lesser-known grape varieties or from smaller, or less-established wine regions. I do plenty of that myself, not least when it comes to the UK’s biggest source of wine, Australia, where it’s easy to be dazzled by the emergence and increased mastery of what the Australians themselves call “alternative” varieties, from the Greek assyrtiko and southern Italian fiano to Iberians such as tourgia nacional and tempranillo.
