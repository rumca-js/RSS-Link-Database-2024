The Lord of the Rings conjures different images in the video game space, whether leading armies into battle across Middle-earth or assassinating Orcs in Mordor. A game doesn't often delve into the Dwarves or tell a story set in the Fourth Age.

That is, until now. The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria sees players venturing to the iconic region, led by Lord Gimli Lockbearer. The goal is to reclaim it, which is easier said than done since a malevolent presence occupies its halls. Whether alone or with three others, players venture through the reaches of Moria, mining and crafting armor and weapons to survive.
