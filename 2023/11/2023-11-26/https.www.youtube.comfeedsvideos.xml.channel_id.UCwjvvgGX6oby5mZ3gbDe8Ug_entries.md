Argentina's 2023 election has rattled the Beijing government. As Argentina's second-largest trading partner, China fears a change in the country's political landscape. But it happened anyway. On November 19, 2023, Argentine economist Javier Milei won the presidential election, heralding a radical change in the country's political landscape, economy, and foreign policy. He has also indicated that he seeks to strengthen ties with the US. 
So far, the official CCP media has blocked Mileiâ€™s specific comments about the Communist Party and the news that Argentina desires to break off its relations with the CCP.
