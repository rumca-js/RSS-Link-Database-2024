Oppenheimer is one of the biggest movies of the year, grossing almost a billion dollars at the box office. And what's crazy about that is that it's a 3-hour drama. There is no Marvel action or DC chases or any usual blockbuster high-speed motion. There's people sitting in rooms talking. And still, it moves faster than most MCU entries. How is that possible? Because Oppenheimer is the ultimate "movie" movie. That's my theory, at least. So, in today's Film Perfection, let's dive into that theory to find more. Why is Oppenheimer such a success and also one of the best movies in a long time.
