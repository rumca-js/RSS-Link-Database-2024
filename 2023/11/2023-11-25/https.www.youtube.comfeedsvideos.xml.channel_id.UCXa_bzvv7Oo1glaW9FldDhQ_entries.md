With Far Cry 7 rumored to be in the works and seemingly offering a non-linear story, it seems like the perfect time for the developer to affect some changes. We'd love to see new mechanics, more involving side quests, less bloat, extensive weapon customization. Allowing certain activities like hunting also wouldn't be too shabby.

Here are 15 changes we'd like to see in Far Cry 7, whenever it releases in the coming years.

Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 1 launched in October as a comprehensive package that brings many of the series’ older and most beloved entries together in a single collection (on top of its fair share of bonuses) though that doesn’t mean that it had everything people were hoping to see. In particular, it left a few things to be desired in terms of its technical features and enhancements. 

Thankfully, the PC modding community has been working on the collection’s games on its own time (as it so often does), and already, we’ve seen quite a few mods that improve and polish the experience in several ways. As such, here, we’re taking a look at some of the best PC mods available for the MGS Master Collection.
