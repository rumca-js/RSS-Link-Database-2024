<p>The new PS5 Slim Digital Edition is now available at major retailers, including <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CL5KNB9M?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/1804712/614286/10014?subId1=subid_value&amp;u=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/sony-playstation-5-slim-console-digital-edition-white/6566040.p?skuId=6566040">Best Buy</a>. Retailing for $450--an increase of $50 versus the original PS5 Slim--the console is a sleeker version of the same hardware. It's not included in any <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/black-friday/">Black Friday</a> sales, but we imagine it will still be a popular holiday item in the coming weeks. If you so choose, you can <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Disc-Drive-Digital-Consoles-PlayStation-5/dp/B0CL5HJNLM?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20">add a disc drive to the PS5 Slim Digital</a> at a later date.
