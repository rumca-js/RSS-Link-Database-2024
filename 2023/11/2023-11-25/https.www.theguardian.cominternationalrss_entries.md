<p>The Tottenham defender on dealing with pressure after a bright start to the season, working with Ange Postecoglou and losing the 2019 Champions League final</p><p>It is not just the self-awareness. What truly hits home with Ben Davies is the willingness to articulate how it feels to have all of those eyeballs trained on him; in the stadium and far beyond – to be at the centre of the madness.</p><p>“This game comes with insane amounts of pressure,” the Tottenham defender says. “And you’ve seen some players find it incredibly difficult. Let’s be honest, we are in a pressure cooker as Premier League players, of tough times being around the corner. Every action you do is judged by millions of people around the world. It’s pretty intense.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/nov/25/ben-davies-when-youre-doing-well-people-get-excited-by-any-wobbles">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Benjamin O Davis Sr and Jr suffered from heinous racism. Doug Melville, a descendant, is determined to do them justice</p><p>This book tells the important story of Benjamin O Davis Sr and Jr, America’s first Black father and son generals. Triumphing over the harsh racism of the first half of the 20th century, their accomplishments were as important to the integration of the US armed forces as the achievements of men like Martin Luther King Jr and Bayard Rustin were in the civilian world. Their comparative anonymity is the reason the author Doug Melville called his book Invisible Generals.</p><p>After Davis Jr was named commander of the first all-Black air unit, the 99th Pursuit Squadron, and later of the 332nd Fighter Group, a larger all-Black unit, he led the celebrated Tuskegee Airmen, one of the most successful fighting units of the second world war.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/nov/25/invisible-generals-review-black-us-military-heroes">Continue reading..

<p>A wondrously wintry, sticky panful of Spanish-style pork belly strips with chickpeas, chestnuts and spinach</p><p>For me, this time of year evokes memories of childhood adventures and roasting chestnuts on the fire with my friend Elsa, so this dish has a special place in my heart. Pork belly strips are a great cut, because they can either be cooked quickly or slowly, and they’re relatively inexpensive, too. You don’t have to use spinach here – try it with red cabbage or cavolo nero instead; some steamed sprouts tossed with crisp bacon bits would also work. But definitely use the manzanilla sherry, because its salty tang works really well with the meat.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/nov/25/sherry-braised-pork-belly-recipe-spinach-chestnuts-jose-pizarro">Continue reading...</a>
