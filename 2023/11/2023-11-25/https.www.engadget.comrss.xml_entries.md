<p>An unsealed complaint in a lawsuit filed against Meta by 33 states alleges the company is not only aware that children under the age of 13 use its platforms, but has also “coveted and pursued” this demographic for years on Instagram. The document, which was first spotted by <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/25/technology/instagram-meta-children-privacy.html"><em>The New York Times</em></a><em>,</em> claims that Meta has long been dishonest about how it handles underage users’ accounts when they’re discovered, often failing to disable them when reported and continuing to harvest their data.</p>

The 1963 - 1989 run was made on a shoestring, leading to lazy gags about wobbly sets and bad visual effects. The 2005 revival was well-budgeted compared to its British TV peers, but still had to work hard to not &quot;embarrass&quot; itself. Now, the show is back, armed with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/doctor-who-disney-plus-2023-150040129.html">bags of cash from Disney in exchange for its international broadcast rights</a>.

## Steam Deck LCD review (2023): Still one of the best handheld PCs

<p>I legitimately feel bad for anyone who bought a Steam Deck right before Valve’s surprise reveal of the new and improved OLED model. The announcement came out of nowhere and the Steam Deck OLED is a better version of the LCD original, at roughly the same price point. So, I understand why the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/">r/SteamDeck</a> forum was immediately flooded with new owners lamenting their life choices. To these people, and to anyone with the debut hardware, I want to make it perfectly clear: The Steam Deck LCD is one of the best handheld PCs on the market.</p>
<p>Valve still thinks it’s pretty good, too. The company is continuing to sell the 256GB LCD version of the Steam Deck at a reduced price of $399, with two OLED models above it. This is the review for people eyeing Valve’s entry-level handheld, and for any original Steam Deck owners who could use a little reassurance these days. (It’s OK, buddy.)</p>

<p>X, the social network formerly known as Twitter, typically earns the most money in the last months of the year, as brands ramp up their advertising campaigns for the holiday shopping season. According to <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/24/business/x-elon-musk-advertisers.html"><em>The New York Times</em></a>, though, the company's earnings report for this quarter might look different than usual. Based on internal documents <em>The Times</em> has seen, over 100 brands and even other types of advertisers, such as political candidates, have fully paused their ads on the website, while dozens more are considering pulling their campaigns. If advertisers don't come back, X could lose up to $75 million in ad revenue earnings this year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The documents reportedly track how X would be affected by brands leaving the website, including the first ones that paused their ads shortly after Elon Musk's controversial tweet, wherein he agreed with an an
