<p>Crucial games in the Premier and Champions League await but injuries and a lack of bite going forward are cause for concern</p><p>Manchester United face three crucial away games in a little more than six days that could define their season: by 10pm next Saturday they could be out of the Champions League and eight points off fourth place in the Premier League, should Spurs beat Aston Villa on Sunday. But despite being a long way from their best form, they can still produce when it matters.</p><p>Erik ten Hag’s side will face hostile atmospheres at Everton, Galatasaray and Newcastle as he aims to keep everything on a fragile track. United have won four of their past five league games, although have rarely looked convincing, but victories breed confidence and they have found a way to grind out results in a top-flight campaign where they have scored 13 goals in 12 matches.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/nov/25/manchester-united-face-crunch-week-on-road-that-cou

<p>This documentary on the 80s air disaster is a multi-layered, compelling watch. It’s a gripping detective story and a beautifully-made, sensitive portrait of grief</p><p>The four-part series Lockerbie is a masterly example of a true-crime documentary put together with great care and compassion, which offers compelling insights into a familiar story. The first episode sensitively recalls the disaster that took place over, in and around the Scottish town on 21 December 1988, when Pan Am 103, on its way from Frankfurt and then London to Detroit, via New York City, exploded mid-air, killing all 243 passengers and 16 crew on board, as well as 11 people on the ground. At first, it was called Britain’s worst ever air crash. Soon, it would also become known as the deadliest terror attack in US history, at that point.</p><p>There are plenty of ways to tell the story, and many have been attempted before, but this series takes a multilayered approach, through an extensive, substantial and wid

In his second season in the series he trails Théo Pourchaire by 16 points with 39 still on the table after a strong season during which he has won six races, including a superb victory in the sprint race on Saturday . Vesti was signed to the Mercedes junior programme in 2021 and concluded a full young driver test for them in Abu Dhabi in 2022. He made his debut on a full grand prix weekend at Mexico this season when he completed the low-speed run over 26 laps and finished 19th, which the team principal, Toto Wolff, admitted was not the ideal chance to assess the youngster’s talents. On Friday, he had a better shot, took over Lewis Hamilton’s car and stayed within seven-tenths of George Russell.</p> <a href="https://w

But after a testing start to his career in north London, Havertz ensured his place in Arsenal folklore when he ghosted in at the far post to steer home Bukayo Saka’s cross. The victory means Arteta’s side go top of the table for the first time this season, with the manager pumping his fist at the final whistle after a testing evening that had frayed the nerves of his goalkeeper in particular.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/nov/25/brentford-arsenal-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

The days of their superstar line-ups seem passed for now, with Charles Piutau and Semi Radradra now moved on, but they boast two England props who proved the foundation of their best bits, most based around the set piece. Calum Sheedy did not miss from the tee, five from five, and his conversions were the difference at half-time, which saw Bristol 21-15 ahead.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/nov/25/saracens-bristol-premiership-rugby-

The visual artist’s interest in fashion, partly inspired by his mother’s secondhand clothes shop, deepened after he undertook a tailoring apprenticeship. “Fashion has been an intrinsic part of my journey since childhood.

<p>(Night Dreamer)<br />Recorded in single-take live performances, the Chicago multi-instrumentalist deftly throws funk, gospel, soul and his own fine voice into the mix</p><p>Isaiah Collier is keen on “the ancestors”. Opening this, his fourth album, the young Chicagoan pays fulsome vocal tribute to bygone jazz giants and soul stars, while his previous record, 2021’s <em>Cosmic Transitions</em>, was a handsome homage to John Coltrane’s masterpiece <em>A Love Supreme</em>. It consolidated Collier’s reputation as a shamanic saxophone prodigy (he’s also an adept multi-instrumentalist with a fine voice), and showed that his admiration for the spiritual jazz of Coltrane, Sun Ra and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/sep/27/pharoah-sanders-obituary">Pharoah Sanders</a> is about inspiration rather than imitation.</p><p><em><a href="https://isaiahcollier.bandcamp.com/album/parallel-universe">Parallel Universe</a></em> is a different creature, the latest direct-to-disc recording

<p>Storing online data in perpetuity is not just about photos and texts but thoughts and ideas. Platforms such as WordPress are starting to act, but it must be at a realistic price</p><p>Way back in 2004 the two founders of Google, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, thought that it would be a cool idea to scan all the printed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Books">books in the world</a> and make them available online. This was at the time when their company’s motto (apart from the guff about not being evil) was to “organise all the world’s information”. Given that the obvious places to look for large collections of books are university libraries, they decided to start there, so they set out to persuade university librarians to let them scan their holdings.</p><p>One of the first institutions they approached was a very large American university: they went to visit its librarian and found him very supportive of their ambitious project. Accordingly, the deal was easily sealed. Af

They did not have a problem with Thomas, but she was part of a cohort that were not considered the world-class talent needed to boost their bid for Champions League football, unlike the exiting Tobin Heath and Christen Press.</p><p>It was somewhat inevitable that the now Tottenham striker would underwhelm in Manchester – not because it was expected, how she would fit in was unknown, but because she was not really given a chance to flourish.

There are many dishes called “treasure” dishes, from four-treasure duck to eight-treasures soup, and I’m often struck by how everyday some of the ingredients in them are, though they may perhaps have been more celebrated centuries ago. This soup is my own attempt to celebrate the three main ingredients in the dish, all of them simple, but all much treasured in my kitchen: tofu, cabbage and spring onions.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/nov/25/chinese-three-treasures-soup-recipe-meera-sodha">Continue reading...</a>

As the number of dogs in the UK has exploded, so has the number of unruly pooches</p><p>Hendrix is absolutely not a bad dog. A sweet-faced black cockapoo, he is a beloved family pet and devoted to his owners. But in a sense, that’s the problem.

<p>Before My Year of Rest and Relaxation, the author published Eileen, a dark noir about another disaffected woman. As it comes to the screen, she looks back on the extreme reaction to her complex heroine</p><p>When my 2015 debut novel Eileen made it on to the shortlist for the Man Booker prize, I knew I was in trouble. Up until that point, I had skirted by the mainstream as a writer of experimental literary short fiction. Writing a full-length novel that resembled something I thought a “normal” person might read felt like an outlandish endeavour at the time, but one I undertook with the seriousness of a young writer desperate to make a living doing what she loves.</p><p>I have since published three other novels and a collection of short stories, and at 42 I have been mostly disabused of my innocence. But a decade earlier, writing a novel that followed the conventions of the traditional form was an act of underhanded rebellion. I felt that I was feeding the beast of a capitalist book
