<p>Video games have a well-established marketing cycle; a key part is releasing a teaser. The process for this can often be quite involved, with some publishers creating a breadcrumb trail of clues and mysteries to solve before eventually giving up the goods. And while this is undoubtedly a great way to build anticipation and hype, what happens when the goods aren't that great?</p><p>On this episode of Spot On, Tam is joined by guest host Jeff Grubb to talk about the frustrations that can arise from teasers, particularly when they provide very few meaningful updates on high-profile games and still far from ready. They also talk about the impact that a lack of satisfying information on games can have on people outside the developer and publishing teams, particularly as big events such as The Game Awards approach.</p><p>Spot On is a weekly news show airing Fridays in which GameSpot's managing editor Tamoor Hussain and senior producer Lucy James talk about the latest news in games.

<p>Ultraman is back on Netflix with a brand-new movie, Ultraman: Rising! We have the first look at the new Ultraman, whose alter ego is professional baseball player Ken Sato, voiced by Christopher Sean (Netflix's You, Hawaii Five-0). This film isn't tied to Netflix's previous Ultraman series, which ran for three seasons and 31 episodes.</p><p>Ultraman: Rising is helmed by animation veteran Shannon Tindle, whose credits include Coraline, Kubo and The Two Strings, and Cartoon Network favorite Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends. Check out the first trailer below.</p><div>          </div><p>Ultraman: Rising looks to lean more into humourous tokusatsu story explorations, with Ultraman trying to save Earth but also protect a child of one of his greatest enemies. Tindle began developing Ultraman: Rising back in 2001. It wasn't initially pitched to be an Ultraman movie, but an original film simply inspired by the Ultraman lore. Ultraman: Rising was officially announced in May 2021.</p><a hr

<p>On May 16, 2023, Blizzard delivered a shocking announcement. After years of fans eagerly awaiting a story-driven PvE Hero mode for Overwatch 2--a mode the studio showcased repeatedly in its promotional material and marketed as a major new pillar for the beloved game--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2s-pve-mode-is-being-scrapped-blizzard-explains-what-happened-and-why/1100-6514242/">Blizzard announced it was scrapping the idea</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">It's no exaggeration to say that fans reacted swiftly and negatively to the news, myself included. Following the announcement, there was one question that I kept coming back to: Without the inclusion of Hero mode, what set Overwatch 2 apart from its predecessor? It didn't make sense to me to create a new game with a "2" in the title that merely felt like a patched version of what came before--not to mention one so similar yet so removed from the spectacle and heart that made the first game one of my all-time favorites

<p dir="ltr">I wasn't really worried about whether director Francis Lawrence, who shepherded three of the four previous Hunger Games movies, would deliver a very well made and watchable flick with The Hunger Games: A Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes. But I <em>was</em> worried that there wouldn't be much point to this thing, since villain-focused prequels aren't usually that worthwhile. What I found instead was the best and most interesting film in this series.</p><p dir="ltr">There's a moment in the middle that summed the whole thing up for me. Coriolanus Snow, who will grow up to become the evil President Snow from the previous movies, is tasked with helping popularize District 12's tribute in the 10th annual Hunger Games in order to win a large amount of money from the father of one of his wealthy classmates. The noble Snow family has fallen on hard times in the years since the death of its patriarch, Coriolanus's father, and this prize could return them to some measure of prominenc

<p>God of War Ragnarok on PS5 is one of those games that you'll boot up when you want to show off your console and new OLED TV, but it wasn't always an incredibly polished action game. Developed by Sony Santa Monica, the sequel to 2018's God of War game had its fair share of bugs and glitches that resulted in some hilarious content prior to its launch. And now, you can see how unintentionally hilarious video game development can be, as Sony Santa Monica is celebrating the first anniversary of God of War Ragnarok with a highlight reel of pure silliness and nightmare fuel.</p><p>The Midgard Mishaps chronicles some truly bizarre body horror, as during the development of the game, characters would contort their bodies as if they had over-lubricated joints, faces would implode, and other scenes would play out <em>very</em> strangely.
