	Democrats will never admit it, but they are the party of the elites. No matter how hard they try to gaslight the public, it does not change the fact that the left fights for the establishment as well as for policies that crush working-class Americans. Republicans are now the anti-establishment populist party and salivate at the thought of sticking it to the elites on behalf of the little guy.
</p><p>
	Subsequently, Democrats not only have nothing to offer Middle America, but they also cannot relate to the average voter.
</p><p>
	No matter what the left says to try and convince Americans that conservatives are in the pockets of special interests, the truth of the matter is that rich Democrats have caused the party to completely abandon the working class.

	The worst thing you can do when <em>South Park</em> comes at you is react negatively to <em>South Park</em> coming at you. Complaining only makes it worse. That's why on behalf of all Americans, allow me to say I NEED this report from <em>Bounding Into Comics</em> to be accurate. Reportedly, Disney is suffering a "mix of shock, embarrassment, feelings of betrayal, and overall butthurt" after watching <em>South Park: Joining the Panderverse.</em>
