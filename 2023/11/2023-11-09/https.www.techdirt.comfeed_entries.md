As the completely normal parents of two completely normal teen boys, I was sincerely hoping I would never have to write about Fortnite again.

This is what I get for praising a move by the FTC earlier this week. It repays me by pushing out a batshit crazy statement regarding AI and copyright. As we&#8217;ve been discussing over the past week, the Copyright Office&#8217;s request for comments regarding AI and copyright has been leading to some odd comments, including [&#8230;]
