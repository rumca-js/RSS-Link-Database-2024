Ofcom is also responsible for enforcing the Online Safety Act (known prior to passage as the Online Safety Bill), which incudes age verification and other protections for young people.

Ofcom is publishing Codes of Practice for social media, gaming, pornography, search and video-sharing websites to use to ensure they are adhering to their obligations. The regulator has also published the results o

		A joint bid by <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/sopra-steria">Sopra Steria</a> and <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/idemia">Idemia</a> to redesign and install a fingerprint biometrics management system for law enforcement was been chosen by France’s Ministries of Justice and the Interior.

The French government’s “FAED” database of fingerprints was established in 1990, and police forensic investigators urgently need it to be upgraded, according to the announcement.

The new “FAED V3” is intended to provide reliability, flexibility and accuracy in criminal identification, and because identifications are used as evidence to secure convictions in court, consistent performance to ensure matches are definitive is a priority. T
