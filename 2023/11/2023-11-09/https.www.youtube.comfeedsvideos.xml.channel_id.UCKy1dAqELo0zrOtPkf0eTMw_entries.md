In today's Daily Fix:

The latest updated to Mario Kart 8 Deluxe removes a controversial "bagging" strategy (or cheat, depending on how you want to think about bagging), which should even the playing field for multiplayer games. The update also brings with it the final batch of booster pack courses, which is impressive for a game that's technically almost 10 years old. Speaking of patches, Marvel's Spider-Man 2 just got one that removes a glitch allowing players to free-roam as Venom. Bummer, but maybe Insomniac should just give us a standalone Venom game. And finally, Game Pass is getting a very helpful update that will tell you when a game you're playing is about to leave the service.

## My Time at Sandrock Review

My Time at Sandrock reviewed by Miranda Sanchez on PC, also available on PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch.

Whether collecting resources, building items, or passing the day away playing minigames with townies, this sequel to My Time at Portia is a joy. It's clear the team behind Sandrock took lessons from Portia to build significant quality-of-life improvements to boost almost every main feature, though dungeon design is still a little too basic to be consistently fun. Even though it doesn't nail everything it attempts and it's got a few odd visual bugs, it's hard to linger on those when the townspeople's golden personalities and Sandrock's general unrelenting dedication to goofiness outshine any minor stumbles. The new multiplayer mode is also another fun way to take on building up this desert town, with different challenges that make playing both it and the campaign a great time.

Here's what GTA 6 gameplay could look like using GTA 5 mods. Rockstar Games has announced it will finally debut its highly anticipated Grand Theft Auto 6 reveal trailer in December 2023, but in the meantime we thought it'd be a good idea to install a bunch of graphical GTA 5 mods to give us an idea of what GTA 6 might look like!

Here are the GTA V mods we used for this video: 

NaturalVision Evolved (Razed Mods)
QuantV 3.0.0 (Quant Mods)

Welcome back to Next-Gen Console Watch, our show following all the news and rumors on the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series. This week Daemon Hatfield is joined by Max Scoville, host of IGN's PlayStation Podcast, Podcast Beyond!, and Bo Moore, IGN's executive tech editor. This week Valve has officially revealed the Steam Deck OLED, and Bo got to spend some time with it. Howeever, it's only been a year and a half after the original Steam Deck was launched. The Steam Deck was hard to come by in the first months of release, even if you had a pre-order. Does a new OLED version so soon mean Valve is confident in their new line of hardware? And what does this mean for Steam Deck competitors like the Ayaneo, ROG Ally, and PlayStation's own Portal streaming handheld?

The follow up to Valve's early 2022 handheld gaming PC, the Steam Deck, has been announced. Dubbed Steam Deck OLED, this new iteration to the Steam Deck family is more than what the name implies. In addition to the larger HDR OLED screen that's capable of a refresh rate of 90hz, the Steam Deck OLED comes with quite a bit of under-the-hood changes that may just make this new entry the definite version of Valve's handheld PC gaming lineup.

The Marvels, reviewed by Amelia Emberwing

The Marvels is a triumph. Its depth can be seen not just through its characters, but through its story as it explores war's complicated fallout; the difficulty of being a human when you are perceived as a monolith; and the hilarious and complicated virtues of family. Both funny and heartfelt, Nia DaCosta’s MCU debut will have you asking when she and her leading ladies are coming back immediately after the credits roll. It’s a pity that the villain isn’t given much to do, though.

News leaked last night that Rockstar is planning some big GTA 6 news, and the publisher confirmed it. While they didn't give a specific date, they teased a first look trailer for sometime in December, and conveniently The Game Awards falls into that timeframe. In other news, Super Mario Bros. Wonder is selling well—so well that it's Nintendo's fastest-selling Super Mario Bros. title since the Wii and DS days. Nintendo has sold more than 4 million copies since October 20th, and will likely sell a few million more by the end of the year. And finally, one of the smallest serial killers to grace the silver screen is coming to Dead by Daylight. Yes, that's right, Chucky the murderous possessed doll will be coming to the game on November 28th.

With this piece of information, Netflix dropped this poster, giving us a glimpse at some of the recognizable characters from the Nickelodeon animated series vividly brought to life for this new adaptation. The series is set to premiere on the streaming service in 2024. And its premiere might be WITHOUT the blessings of the show’s creators. For those that might not remember, the original creators of #avatarthelastairbender  left the project back in 2020. According to co-creator Michael Dante DiMartino, Netflix was initially committed to bringing the original vision he and his co-creator had in mind, but somewhere down the line things apparently changed. In other news, The Boys season 4 is another series we can expect in 2024. And Kevin Fiege updates us on his Star Wars movie.
