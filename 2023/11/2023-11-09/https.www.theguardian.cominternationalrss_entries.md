I love scanning thrift shop shelves for wobbly-stemmed green martini glasses and cups with little strawberries painted on them.

But I definitely would not love to get lead poisoning from them, and unfortunately, some of these homewares might carry that risk.</p><p>Before US regulatory measures introduced in the mid-1970s, manufacturers often added lead, and to a lesser extent, the carcinogens cadmium and arsenic, to ceramic glazes, painted barware and crystal glassware, to improve their appearance or durability.

His ragged, adolescent voice has been frequently and correctly compared to the mournful cry of Post Malone, the single defining sound of zillennial heartbreak for the better part of a decade. Unlike Post Malone, who sings through a glazed, pilled-out fugue, Howard – who records as the Kid Laroi, a nod to his Kamilaroi heritage – sounds as though he’s always pushing himself to the furthest possible limits: his voice strains, the volume peaks and the spectrum of emotions he’s trying to convey melts into toxic agony.</p><p>I love this aspect of the Kid Laroi’s music: it’s what separates him from the dozens of other Post Malone acolytes currently populating popular music and what makes his hits so successful on a musical level.

It is unlikely the public will ever know the full story behind either of these breaks or indeed Lanning’s retirement. She is an intensely private person – an increasing rarity in the social media age – and these reasons are likely to be kept close to her chest, shared only with her nearest and dearest.</p> <a href="https://www.theguard
