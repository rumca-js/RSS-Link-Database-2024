Dungeons 4 promises a better-looking experience with improved visuals and more threats, like the Dwarves, but it's for those who want more of this gameplay loop.\n\nInterested in defending your dungeon from interlopers while smacking minions to speed up their tasks? How about placing traps and building an army of Undead, Demons and the Horde to assail do-gooders, twisting the landscape? That's all here, backed by horrific humor and odd performance issues.\n\nNevertheless, even if it doesn't demand too much strategy, Dungeons 4 is fun and somewhat addictive. Just ignore the story as best as possible and try not to be too put off by the poor jokes.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwRfEHAaOZQ", "date_published": "2023-11-09T19:30:02+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "GamingBolt", "album": "GamingBolt", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/LwRfEHAaOZQ/hqdefault.jpg", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 1, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "Avatar Frontiers of Pandora - 15 Things To Know Before You Buy", "description": "Sure, its reminiscent of Far Cry, with hunter-gathering, harvesting, outpost raiding, crafting, all set within a wide-ranging wilderness set to provide an air of familiarity to anyone who\u2019s played an open world game before.

But though Rockstar has surely taken its sweet time to get to this point, we are, at long last, finally getting to the stage where the series\u2019 next mainline instalment is, at the very least, on the horizon. \n\nGrand Theft Auto 6 is set to be unveiled next month, and with excitement surrounding its official unveiling mounting by the second, here, we\u2019re tackling the all too important question of when it will actually launch. Will it be out on shelves before April 2025 as reports have suggested, or will we have to wait longer than that to get our hands on the long-anticipated title?", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDc7Km68-6A", "date_published": "2023-11-09T10:45:01+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "GamingBolt", "album": "GamingBolt", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/VDc7Km68-6A/hqdefault.jpg", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}]
