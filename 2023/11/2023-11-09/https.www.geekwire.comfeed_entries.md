He declined to comment further on specific merger and acquisition discussions.  Robins said that its more mature MRD technology — which is designed to detect minimal residual disease in bone marrow from leukemia and other cancer patients — differs&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/adaptive-biotech-hires-goldman-sachs-to-explore-strategic-alternatives-for-key-business-lines/

That&#8217;s the premise behind Wokelo, a Seattle-area startup co-founded by two former management consultants, Siddhant Masson and Saswat Nanda. Wokelo uses AI to produce detailed, multi-page due-diligence reports in a matter of minutes — including an overview of the subject company, insights from news coverage, a funding summary, list of recent product launches, and industry landscape, backed up by extensive citations.

In addition, Valve claims the new editions of the Deck are 5% lighter, with better thermal circulation. The new OLED models effectively replace the old Steam Deck’s 64 GB and 512 GB SKUs,&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/valve-surprises-with-new-model-of-the-steam-deck-portable-gaming-pc/">Read More</a>

The UW team has developed deep-learning algorithms that let users decide which sounds to filter out from an environment and which sounds to let in. Examples include sitting in a park enjoying the sound of birds chirping, while blocking the sound of people talking. Or blocking the buzz of a vacuum being run at home while allowing a knock at the door to be heard. The system, called &#8220;semantic hearing,&#8221; works with headphones that stream&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/univ-of-washington-researchers-use-ai-to-help-noise-canceling-headphones-filter-certain-sounds/">Read More</a>

The verdict and judgment Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Delaware were the culmination of a July 2019 lawsuit. GeekWire has contacted Amazon for comment on the outcome and the possibility of appeal.

The suit alleges that Amazon &#8220;has engaged in a repeated and systematic scheme&#8221; related to products purchased on its online marketplace and returned by customers who say they never received a refund for products that were &#8220;timely and properly&#8221; returned to the company. Customers have been &#8220;deceived by Amazon’s unfair trade practices,&#8221; according to the lawsuit. Amazon declined to comment when contacted by GeekWire.

The company in August announced the new option to select cities, but now it&#8217;s available in all locations where Amazon Fresh delivers to Prime members. Amazon said on Thursday it will soon also do the same for delivery and pickup from Whole Foods — allowing non-Prime members access to those services. The moves aim to boost growth for Amazon&#8217;s grocery business. Amazon first rolled out Amazon Fresh delivery in 2007.
