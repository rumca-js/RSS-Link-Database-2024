<p>Prequel to the hit teen dystopia recruits Rachel Zegler and Jason Schwartzman to labour over IP that is now starved of inspiration</p><p>It’s easy to lose the will to live halfway through the title, never mind the actual film – in all its exhausting, convoluted silliness. This is a pointless new iteration of IP content from the Hunger Games franchise, based on Suzanne Collins’s original YA bestsellers, which over four movies from 2012 to 2015 confirmed the superstar status of Jennifer Lawrence, playing defiant heroine Katniss Everdeen, one of the starving people in a dystopian future state forced to take part in a bizarre televised survival contest. That initially fierce film series was subject to the law of diminishing returns, but they never quite diminished to zero.</p><p>For this prequel, however – taken from Collins’s 2020 novel of the same title – the interest, dramatic momentum and energy have frankly expired, and all we have are the ridiculous outfits, the hallucinatory ha

For starters, he flips the pictures upside down – his habitual way of inverting reality. But that’s just the beginning. Baselitz unleashes a joyous arsenal of artistic ingenuity on these crude images of a couple making love, bringing both immense technical skill and witty conceptual brilliance to pictures that, through his eyes, become oddly moving.</p><p>This year Baselitz turned 85 and his birthday is being celebrated with exhibitions all over the world, from a show of his rough-hewn wooden sculptures at London’s Serpentine to new paintings of shamanistic h

When Vic Akers left Arsenal Women after 10 trophy-laden years in 1997, his successor lasted a season and Akers was brought back. He managed the club for a further decade with lots of success.

<p>In a profoundly intimate film, director Maite Alberdi follows an influential Chilean journalist and his partner as they navigate life after an Alzheimer’s diagnosis</p><p>At the start of the Chilean documentary The Eternal Memory, a woman asks her husband, who has Alzheimer’s, if he likes his life. He beams back at her. “I love life.” The couple will be instantly recognisable to audiences in Chile. He is Augusto Góngora, a journalist who was part of an underground television news service during the Pinochet dictatorship. Out on the streets he filmed the reality of life under military rule – at huge personal risk. The group’s bulletins, recorded on VHS tapes, were passed from house to house across the country. When Chile returned to democracy, Góngora became an influential figure on public television. His partner of 25 years, Paulina Urrutia, is a famous stage and screen actor. In 2014, aged 62, Góngora was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s. The Eternal Memory documents the pair’s final y

<p>Tracking right and backing a divisive war, Keir Starmer’s party resembles the Labour of 2005 – the beginning of the end of its last government</p><p>When an opposition party hasn’t won a general election for 18 years, you might expect its last success to be cited as a model for how that party could win again. Societies and suitable electoral strategies change over time, of course, but parties that don’t win very often have a limited choice of inspirational examples.</p><p>Labour is such a party. And in some ways <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2005/may/06/politics.ukgeneralelection2005">its 2005 victory</a> still looks an impressive achievement. Labour’s third consecutive win – the only time it has managed that – was also the last time any party took a majority of seats in England, Scotland and Wales alike. Unlike all the Tory regimes since, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown’s administrations between 2005 and 2010 could claim to be nationally representative governments.</p>

She is a savvy, fearless political operator and becomes the master of her own narrative.

Anything about erections sells, and as an elevator pitch, it works brilliantly: a herbal equivalent of Viagra is discovered and pressed into lucrative service by a Mormon called Kelly Harvey and an elusive vegan called Erb Avore who are soon employing 200 people to pack capsules with “extract of golden speargrass” and taking home suitcases of cash as the product works and sales take off.

For those who had thought of Hollywood as the very epitome of free-marketeerism, the spectacle of an actual strike, which remained reasonably popular and un-demonised in the press, and which produced a result, is quite startling.

The 27-year-old then made up for not finding the net in a 2-0 win over his former club Köln by registering a 15-minute hat-trick against Wolfsburg – the fastest in the Bundesliga for more than 50 years – at the start of October.

<p><strong>Royal Shakespeare theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon<br /></strong>This is a well-crafted, brilliantly acted version of John Masefield’s novel about an orphan who travels through time</p><p>Going small and swift are the magical transformations available to orphan Kay Harker from the mysterious box in John Masefield’s 1935 novel. The RSC’s new production goes big: bold video designs, aerial sequences, abundant puppetry, a sprawling and handsomely dressed cast, plus an eight-piece band. It’s swift, too, gliding through Kay’s travels to ancient times and his encounters with the 30s criminal underworld.</p><p>If the play loses some of the richly bewildering quality of Masefield’s storytelling, whose folklore envelops the reader like smoke, this is a well-crafted show that recognises Masefield’s place in the pantheon of fantasy novelists. It brings us, if not a lion, then wolves, a witch and a wardrobe, through which characters emerge in Tom Piper’s elegantly versatile set design.</p

<p>Annette Bening plays the swimmer in a new Netflix biopic; but as her coach, Jodie Foster also achieves something remarkable</p><p>There is something mythic about the story of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jul/10/endurance-swimmer-diana-nyad-its-about-steel-trap-mind">Diana Nyad</a>, the first (and, to date, only) person to swim the 110 miles from Cuba to the US without the use of a shark cage. Nyad was 64 and on her fifth attempt when she succeeded in 2013, a feat that should not have been humanly possible. As well as the sharks, there were deadly box jellyfish, and the Gulf stream itself, threatening to sweep her away from the support boat and out into the ocean. Her success was inspiring and continues to inspire, although, as we see in Nyad, the new <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/oct/22/nyad-netflix-review-annette-bening-jodi-foster-marathon-swimming-biopic-diana-nyad">Netflix biopic</a>, not always in the obvious ways.</p><p>You would ha

<p>Speaking out for the first time since the cancellation of her award ceremony at the Frankfurt book fair, the Palestinian author sheds light on her work and the power of linguistics and erasure</p><p>When she was a child, Adania Shibli encountered her first storyteller on her family’s almond and olive farm in Palestine. It was her mother. “When we didn’t have electricity, my mom would gather us around, because we were afraid and we couldn’t read. She would tell us stories until the light came back.”</p><p>Shibli’s mother didn’t read or write, so the stories she told live now only in Shibli’s brothers and sisters. On a recent morning, back in Zurich where the novelist is in residency, one of these tales chimneys up through memory. Retelling it over Zoom, Shibli’s face breaks into the wide smile that spreads across her face any time she speaks of her family. In the swirl of her telling, the plot floats away but one thing becomes clear: in the tale, as a result of a man’s carelessness

<p>The author of Under the Skin’s eccentric take on music fails to reverberate </p><p>Listen! These days everyone is telling you to listen, how to listen, why it’s important to listen. Active listening, deep listening, the art of listening: for a fee – sometimes a large fee – life-body-spirit magi will teach you how to refine your ears. Listen to your gut, they say. Your breathing. To others, too, the excluded. Listening is not just self-care; it’s ethics, social engagement, imaginative reparation. Often listening is more cant than action: it’s what every other politician promises to their constituents, what CEOs vow to do when their employees get uppity.</p><p>Listening is a passion of novelist and short-story writer Michel Faber. In his house, he reveals, there’s a whole room devoted to cassettes, vinyl, archived MP3s; when he goes round to other people’s homes he often squats down to peer at his hosts’ CD collections.

<p>Doc following the Libertines star, made by his wife, is unsparing in showing his struggles with drug addiction but shies away from other personal stories</p><p>As Spinal Tap’s David St Hubbins once argued, it is possible to have too much perspective; but perhaps there isn’t quite enough perspective in this documentary about the iconic rock star and songwriter Pete Doherty (who in the title goes by the more mature “Peter”), former frontman of the Libertines and Babyshambles. The film is directed by Doherty’s wife Katia DeVidas, although the actual story of their relationship or any of Doherty’s previous relationships does not feature here; of course, it could be that Doherty and DeVidas understandably reject the tabloid prurience associated with that whole subject.

The obvious explanation was close at hand: the daughter of the family made no secret of being a talented ventriloquist.</p><p>Despite this, it amused the press to maintain a deadpan attitude to the possibility of “Gef” being real, and there was no shortage of credulous and excitable spiritualists who were excited by the idea.

<p>Andrew Wylie is agent to an extraordinary number of the planet’s biggest authors. His knack for making highbrow writers very rich helped to define a literary era – but is his reign now coming to an end?</p><p>Andrew Wylie, the world’s most renowned – and for a long time its most reviled – literary agent, is 76 years old. Over the past four decades, he has reshaped the business of publishing in profound and, some say, insalubrious ways. He has been a champion of highbrow books and unabashed commerce, making many great writers famous and many famous writers rich. In the process, he has helped to define the global literary canon. His critics argue that he has also hastened the demise of the literary culture he claims to defend. Wylie is largely untroubled by such criticisms. What preoccupies him, instead, are the deals to be made in China.</p><p>Wylie’s fervour for China began in 2008, when a bidding war broke out among Chinese publishers for the collected works of Jorge Luis Borges.
