Warframe developer Digital Extremes has confirmed a "number of" layoffs at the studio resulting from the closure of its publishing division. It's also announced it'll no longer be publishing free-to-play online action-RPG Wayfinder following the closure, and that full control of the property will return to developer Airship Syndicate.
</p><p>
In a statement provided to Eurogamer after news of layoffs at the studio was broken <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/warframe-developer-axes-publishing-division-will-transition-full-control-of-online-action-rpg-wayfinder-to-its-developer/">via PC Gamer</a>, Digital Extremes wrote, "We can confirm we have made the difficult decision to cease operations of our external projects division."

Remnant 2's first expansion, The Awakened King, is right around the corner, and ahead of its release next Tuesday, 14th November, developer Gunfire Games has revealed a second copy of the DLC won't be required to play it with a friend.
</p><p>
The Awakened King, to provide a bit of context, introduces a new storyline focusing on the Root-corrupted (and decidedly peeved) One True King. It'll see players attempting to uncover his secrets by exploring the seaside town of the Forlorn Coast, a new area of Losomn containing dungeons and "unexpected allies". It also adds news weapons and equipment, new enemies and bosses, plus the new Ritualist archetype.
</p><p>
It sounds like a good solid chunk of <em>stuff</em> for Remnant 2 fans to get stuck into, then, and Gunfire Games has now <a href="https://x.com/Remn

It's been over three years since developer Jonathan Blow announced his critically acclaimed, time-manipulating platform-puzzler Braid was getting an Anniversary Edition, but, finally, a release is in sight; it's coming to Xbox, PlayStation, PC, and Netflix mobile on April 30th, 2024.
</p><p>
Given that Braid initially launched for Xbox 360 all the way back in August 2008, its Anniversary Edition will be arriving squarely within its 15th birthday year, and a significant amount of work has been done on the original release to celebrate that milestone.
</p><p>
For starters, Braid's gorgeous visuals have been "hand-repainted" by original artist David Hellman. Today's press release doesn't elaborate on that much, but when the Anniversary Edition was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/braid-is-getting-an-anniversary-edition-with-red

## Valve launches Steam Deck OLED this month

Valve has announced Steam Deck OLED, a revamped version of its popular handheld PC which boasts - as you might guess - a shiny new OLED screen as its star feature.
</p><p>
Steam Deck OLED retains the existing size and main technical specs of the current Steam Deck (so all current Steam Deck verified games will run the same on OLED models), but includes an improved display that's bigger and uses HDR.
</p><p>
The new OLED models go on sale next week, on 16th November at 6pm UK time priced at $549 for a 512GB model or $649 for a 1TB model. (There's also a lower $399 price right now for the 256GB current LCD model, which is sticking around as an entry-price alternative.)

## Valve says "technology doesn't exist" yet for full Steam Deck 2.0

Don't expect Steam Deck 2.0 anytime soon, Valve has said, as the technology to launch a handheld with an adequately beefy jump in power just doesn't yet exist.
</p><p>
Speaking to Eurogamer ahead of today's Steam Deck OLED announcement, Valve engineers discussed the features it is adding to its shinier new handheld model that were not possible to provide back when the original Steam Deck debuted. 
</p><p>
The company also said it was working on game projects - plural - right now which were still targeting current Steam Deck hardware performance levels (which remain unchanged in the OLED).

## Steam Deck OLED review: a beautiful display upgrade - and so much more

Let's be clear, the brand new Steam Deck OLED isn't just the original machine with a brand new display. Excluding the outer shell, it's essentially a top to bottom revamp of the entire machine and perhaps the most extensive mid-generation 'console refresh' I've seen. But let's give that beautiful new display its due: it's bigger, brighter, runs at 90Hz and in combination with enhancements to SteamOS, you get full HDR support too. Boot up Ori and the Will of the Wisps for some class-leading HDR and you quickly realise that Valve has delivered home cinema display fidelity to a handheld games machine. It's simply stunning. 
</p><p>
Side-by-side with the original Deck, the handheld itself looks much the same as the first generation offering but as soon as you power up the unit, you'll see an extraordinary, night and day

As we stroll gamely into month two of Sea of Thieves' <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sea-of-thieves-season-10-release-delayed-into-october">extremely long-delayed Season 10</a>, Rare has announced that the second of its three big tentpole features - the new PvP-focused Skull of the Siren Song voyage - will arrive next Thursday, 16th November.
</p><p>
The Skull of the Siren Song provides a more action-orientated addition to Rare's piratical multiplayer adventure following the introduction of Guilds last month, essentially unfolding as an opt-in server-wide race to find the titular jewel-encrusted treasure.
</p><p>
Crews can opt-in to the new voyage whenever a ghostly note randomly appears on their ship's mast during play. Once a sufficient number of teams are signed up, Captain Briggsy appears to hand them al

Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth may include a 17 minute CG film to recap the events of Final Fantasy 7 Remake.
</p><p>
That's according to a Korean forum for the forthcoming game, which claims producer Yoshinori Kitase mentioned in an interview a certain segment of the Rebirth trailer was actually taken from this CG sequence, which will be available to view at any time.
</p><p>
Final Fantasy streamer Aitai Kimochi shared the news on X, formerly Twitter, but noted the Korean forum doesn't list an exact source for the interview.

Strauss Zelnick, boss of GTA publisher Take-Two, has credited the company's "three-part strategy" as the reason it has managed to avoid mass layoffs this year.
</p><p>
As we have reported numerous times over the past several months, the video game industry has seen layoffs after layoffs this year. This has resulted in studios being closed, such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saints-row-studio-volition-has-been-closed-down-effective-immediately">Saints Row developer Volition</a>. Others, such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-games-is-reportedly-laying-off-900-employees">Epic</a>, have seen their numbers significantly reduced. 
</p><p>
According to Zelnick, Take-Two has managed to avoid such consequences thanks to moderate investments and a focus on efficiency over recent years.

Broken Roads, the upcoming narrative-driven cRPG from developer Drop Bear Bytes, has been delayed.
</p><p>
The game was set to release in just a few days time, on 14th November. However, the developer has now announced it has delayed the game at the last minute to "allow for additional polish time". More work is needed to make sure Broken Roads isn't broken on release, essentially, with the help of more QA testing.
</p><p>
In a post on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1403440/Broken_Roads/">Steam</a>, the Broken Roads team stated the game was "content complete" but "coming in longer" than originally expected. The developer said its roughly 30 hours of gameplay and vast dialogue had made it "extremely time-consuming to properly test" all of the game's content.

Sony has now sold 46.5m PlayStation 5 units.
</p><p>
That's according to its latest financial earnings report, where hardware sales for the last quarter were 4.9m - a Q2 record for a PlayStation console. As <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-5-sales-reach-417m">previously reported in August</a>, Sony had then sold 41.7m units.
</p><p>
Sony stated these sales were in-line with expectations and a 25 percent increase on PS4 units sold in the equivalent period (Q2 FY17). Further, the 4.9m PS5 consoles sold in Q2 is a 48 percent increase compared to last year, likely owing to increased stock.

## Like A Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name review - Kiryu makes an entertaining but superfluous return

There's a joke among Yakuza fans that Kazuma Kiryu will never truly be gone. At 90 years old he'll be hauling himself out of the retirement home to beat some poor sod's face in, before heading to the nearest pocket circuit club to race miniature cars against children. Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name feels like it's aware of the joke - in part because it's the force pulling Kiryu out of retirement for yet another bout. 
</p><p>
Kiryu, or rather special agent Joryu, now puts the beatdown on foes at the behest of the secretive Daidoji faction - the same group he thwarted in Yakuza 6: The Song of Life. Having faked his death at the end of Yakuza 6, Like a Dragon Gaiden largely revolves around Kiryu trying to maintain his covert status so as to protect the children of Morning Glory O

<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-guides-tips-tricks-9352">Starfield</a>'s protagonist is silent, but that wasn't always the case. Sam Coe's voice actor Elias Toufexis has revealed he recorded lines as the voice of the male lead, while Cissy Jones did so as the game's female protagonist.
</p><p>
In a recent post on X, formerly Twitter, Toufexis said both he and Jones "worked for months" providing dialogue for the main player character. 
</p><p>
But, as we all know to be the case, Bethesda ultimately decided Starfield's protagonist should remain silent.

Video games are not strangers to museums and galleries. Over the last few years games have landed in places like the V&amp;A and the MoMA. But it's still relatively rare to have games sharing the same space as other artworks, let alone for a gallery to ensure they're playable for the audience, just like they are in their living rooms.

Merging the art world with the video game world comes instinctively for contemporary artist <a href="https://www.larryachiampong.co.uk/">Larry Achiampong</a>, however, whose works span multiple disciplines from sculpture to film to collages and more. While postcolonialism and pan-Africanism are key themes in the British Ghanaian artist's works, so are video games, having been a part of his life

A long time ago, in a press release that now seems far, far away, mobile game maker Zynga announced arena squad shooter Star Wars: Hunters for Nintendo Switch and smartphones. 
</p><p>
But in the years since, Star Wars: Hunters has been repeatedly delayed, with an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zynga-shows-off-star-wars-hunters-for-switch-and-mobile">original 2021 launch window turning into 2022</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zynga-delays-arena-shooter-star-wars-hunters-worldwide-launch-into-next-year">then 2023</a>, and now - as of last night - 2024.
</p><p>
In a <a href="https://twitter.com/ZyngaStarWars/status/1722362138168025411">statement</a> issued to X, formerly Twitter, last night, Zynga said it had made the "difficult decision to delay the worldwide laun

<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spider-man-2-walkthrough-9356">Marvel's Spider-Man 2</a> has now sold over 5m copies.
</p><p>
Sony announced the sales milestone today as part of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-confirms-delay-to-half-its-planned-live-service-games">its most recent financial results</a>, prompting developer Insomniac to share the news more widely on X (formerly Twitter), alongside a rather pleased-looking Kraven the Hunter gif. 
</p><p>
"Thank you to our incredible community for supporting us and helping us reach this milestone!" the developer wrote, as Kraven 'Whooped' below.

Sony has halved the number of live service games it plans to release by March 2026 from 12 to six.
</p><p>
Back in February 2022, Sony stated it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plans-to-launch-more-than-10-live-service-games-before-march-2026">aimed to launch over 10 new live service games</a>. The news came days after it acquired Destiny developer Bungie

</p><p>
Now, however, it seems plans are being scaled back to ensure each live service game's quality, as Sony president, COO and CFO Hiroki Totoki explained on a call discussing the company's latest financial results (thanks <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sony-confirms-its-delayed-half-of-its-12-planned-live-service-games/">VGC</a>).

Unannounced football game Lego 2K Goooal! has leaked yet again, this time with official artwork via a listing on the PlayStation Store. 
</p><p>
It's the first time we've got an impression of how the game will look, with fantasy Lego characters such as a knight and a pirate with a peg-leg, and what looks like a dragon flying through the sky.
</p><p>
The artwork was spotted on the PlayStation Store and shared on social media by industry analyst <a href="https://twitter.com/MauroNL3/status/1722189948638363722">MauroNL</a>, who noted that the product's page had since been deleted.
