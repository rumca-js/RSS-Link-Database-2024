The series is set to premiere on the streaming service in 2024. And its premiere might be WITHOUT the blessings of the show\u2019s creators. For those that might not remember, the original creators of #avatarthelastairbender  left the project back in 2020. According to co-creator Michael Dante DiMartino, Netflix was initially committed to bringing the original vision he and his co-creator had in mind, but somewhere down the line things apparently changed. In other news, The Boys season 4 is another series we can expect in 2024.
