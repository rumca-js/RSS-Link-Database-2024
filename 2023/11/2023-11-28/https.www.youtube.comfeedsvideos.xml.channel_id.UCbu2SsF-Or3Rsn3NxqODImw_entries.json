In this documentary, GameSpot follows developer CD PROJEKT RED as they launch Cyberpunk\u2019s latest expansion, Phantom Liberty.\n\nWe interview roughly a dozen developers on the difficult launch of Cyberpunk 2077, the changes the studio underwent afterward, and how all that has led to Phantom Liberty. We were embedded in the studio during launch so we were able to capture the raw emotions of what it\u2019s like to launch a AAA video game. As fans of CD PROJEKT RED and their work, we wanted to get an inside perspective on one of the biggest studios, and one of the most controversial releases of all time.\n\n00:00 - Intro\n02:05 - The Story of CDPR\n03:28 - Office Tour\n06:02 - The Launch of 2077\n09:30 - Fixing the Problem\n12:43 - Open Communication\n16:02 - Lessons Learned\n20:13 - The Launch of Phantom Liberty\n26:05 - Redemption\n30:30 - Credits", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBnPNwv6C0E", "date_published": "2023-11-28T15:00:39+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "GameSpot - YouTube", "album": "GameSpot - YouTube", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/kBnPNwv6C0E/hqdefault.jpg", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}]
