It is not for nothing that the Chinese are optimistic about bad credit as the number of people with bad credit will only accelerate in the future. 
The emergence of crowds with bad credit will also worsen China's economic performance. For example, most people who have been restricted in banking activities due to bad credit are business people in need of frequent financial transactions. As they arenâ€™t eligible for bank loans anymore, they are likely to become delinquent debtors again, which will ultimately hinder economic operations, creating a vicious cycle.
