A sugar-based molecule naturally produced by the body can help cells grow, differentiate into different types, self-destruct if need be and much more. It helps protect the cell's genome, repair DNA, and regulate how genes are passed down. The molecule, called poly(adenosine diphosphate ribose) or poly(ADP-ribose), can potentially inform disease prevention and treatments—if scientists can figure out exactly how it works.

I'm sure many readers of Universe Today are, like me, fans of the science fiction genre. From the light sabers of "Star Wars" to the neuralyzer of "Men in Black," science fiction has crazy inventions aplenty and once science fiction writers dream it, scientists and engineers try and create it. Perhaps the holy grail of science fiction creations is the warp drive from "Star Trek" and it is fair to say that many have tried to work out if it is even possible to travel faster than the speed of light. To date, alas, to no avail but if the warp drive eludes us, what about faster-than-light communication.

When spacecraft return to Earth, they don't need to shed all their velocity by firing retro-rockets. Instead, they use the atmosphere as a brake to slow down for a soft landing. Every planet in the solar system except Mercury has enough of an atmosphere to allow aerobraking maneuvers, and could allow high-speed exploration missions. A new paper looks at the different worlds and how a spacecraft must fly to take advantage of this "free lunch" to slow down at the destination.

The El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO)—the climate phenomenon comprising the warm El Niño, cool La Niña, and neutral climate phases—occurs on a cycle that lasts 2–7 years. When it forms, ENSO drives irregular weather that can spark wildfires, cause drought or flooding, and disrupt agricultural production. Because of its global impacts, accurately forecasting ENSO's extremes is vital for human health and economies.
