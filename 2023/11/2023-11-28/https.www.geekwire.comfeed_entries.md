A woman from Latin American countries will more often be sexualized than European and Asian women. People of nonbinary gender and Indigenous people will hardly exist.

That’s the debate after Google Cloud bought advertising space on the Las Vegas Sphere to send a message to attendees this week at the Amazon Web Services re:Invent conference, taking place on the next block over. Google Cloud tipped reporters off to the ad on Monday, with a long list of bullet points describing its prowess in generative AI infrastructure, services, and applications. I happened to be in the area when I saw the email, so I walked over and waited until it appeared.

Since 2005, nearly 2,900 U.S. newspapers have closed. Washington state lawmakers grew so concerned about the trend that in 2009, they enacted a law providing newspapers a significant financial discount on their business and occupation, or B&#38;O, taxes. News outlets continued vanishing and surviving newsrooms shrank. So earlier this year, state lawmakers went a step further and eliminated the B&#38;O tax for newspapers and expanded the deal to include a handful of digital-only news sites. Last week, the Seattle City Council passed its own&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/why-digital-news-sites-were-omitted-from-a-washington-tax-exemption-trying-to-aid-local-media/">Read More</a>
