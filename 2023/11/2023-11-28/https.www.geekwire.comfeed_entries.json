Since 2005, nearly 2,900 U.S. newspapers have closed. Washington state lawmakers grew so concerned about the trend that in 2009, they enacted a law providing newspapers a significant financial discount on their business and occupation, or B&#38;O, taxes. News outlets continued vanishing and surviving newsrooms shrank. So earlier this year, state lawmakers went a step further and eliminated the B&#38;O tax for newspapers and expanded the deal to include a handful of digital-only news sites.
