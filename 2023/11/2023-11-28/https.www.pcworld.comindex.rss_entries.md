<p>One of the best things about backing up your files to an online service is that they&rsquo;re, well, backed up. So it&rsquo;s understandable that a lot of Google Drive users are upset after finding out that this may not be the case. An error with a recent version of the desktop client for Google Drive has resulted in missing files for some users &mdash; a <em>lot </em>of missing files going back several months in a few cases. </p>

<p>Boy, Nvidia and Microsoft are sure getting chummy, huh? Just a couple of weeks after Microsoft added Xbox account syncing and Game Pass titles to the GeForce Now streaming service, Nvidia is throwing in three months of the PC version of Game Pass with new RTX card purchases. That&rsquo;s on top of the expected GeForce Now freebies. Not bad, especially if you picked up one of the cards on a Black Friday or Cyber Monday discount. </p>



<p>According to <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/campaigns/pc-game-pass-pc-game-bundle/&amp;xcust=2-1-2156578-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Nvidia&rsquo;s promotional page</a>, buyers of just about any RTX 40-series card will qualify for three free months of Microsoft&rsquo;s PC Game Pass subscription. That includes the RTX 4060, 406

<p>On multiple occasions after publishing a review, I&rsquo;ve had companies reach out to me to try and tell me why my opinions were wrong. I politely listen to their rebuttals, and then I don&rsquo;t change the review, because hearing <em>why </em>a mouse button was put in a specific place doesn&rsquo;t make me like it any better. Bethesda has decided to take the same tactic, except instead of rebutting professional reviewers, they&rsquo;re arguing with PC gamers &mdash; their own, <em>direct customers</em> &mdash; in the Steam reviews for <em>Starfield</em>. </p>

<p>Last autumn, Microsoft Word integrated a text prediction feature that suggests the next word it thinks you will type. Pressing the Tab key or right arrow accepts the suggestion</p>



<p>The feature is supposed to help you save time, but the words predicted by Word rarely make sense and fit into the text. It&rsquo;s often therefore a distraction that hinders writing rather than helping you. </p>



<p>But you can turn off Microsoft Word&rsquo;s text prediction: Click on &ldquo;File -&lsquo; Options&rdquo; and in the following window, click &ldquo;Advanced.&rdquo; Uncheck the box next to &ldquo;Show text predictions as you type&rdquo; and confirm your decision by clicking &ldquo;OK.&rdquo; </p>



<p>Alternatively, you can click on &ldquo;Text predictions: on&rdquo; at the bottom of your Microsoft Word window to go directly to the menu specified above.</p>

<p>Antivirus has become these days a catch-all term. It doesn&rsquo;t just mean blocking literal computer viruses, trojans, and other bits of malicious code meant to attack your PC. When you opt to go beyond Microsoft&rsquo;s built-in protections, an antivirus software subscription can provide a light step up from Windows Defender or a set of intensely comprehensive safeguards that extend to your financial accounts.</p>



<p>So what level of defense do you need, especially when you&rsquo;re concerned about all angles of online security? Here are the general levels of protection you can choose from, as well as what you should consider when considering each.</p>
