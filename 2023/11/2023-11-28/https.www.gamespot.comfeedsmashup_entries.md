Fans of the James Cameron sci-fi series might find clues about Avatar 3 inside Frontiers of Pandora, according to Avatar studio Lightstorm's Joshua Izzo.</p><p>He told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/future-avatar-movies-could-feature-elements-created-for-ubisofts-frontiers-of-pandora-game">IGN</a>, "I can say that there are going to be some future sequel elements in Frontiers of Pandora that will pay off when the movie comes out, when Avatar 3 comes out in 2025," Izzo said. He added, "Careful Avatar fans who have played the game will want to go back and maybe revisit certain things because it will be revealed to them in '25."</p><p>Frontiers of Pandora features three new Na'vi clans never before seen in the movies, and producer Jon Landau said these gro

<p dir="ltr">When you think of the Texas Chain Saw Massacre, your mind probably pictures Leatherface. But the mask-wearing cannibal won't be a requirement in matches going forward for the multiplayer horror game.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.txchainsawgame.com/hub/patch-notes-nov-28">The Texas Chain Saw Massacre patch notes</a> for today, November 28, specifically state that "we have removed the requirement for Leatherface in every match." Gun Interactive adds that nothing else has changed with this alteration--maps or family spawns, for instance. Instead, this seems like a way to not force players into the Leatherface role.</p><p dir="ltr">Another important change for the asymmetrical multiplayer game revolves around addressing valve gameplay on the Slaughterhouse map.

<p>Three years after a rough launch, Cyberpunk 2077 is in its best shape thanks to a steady stream of updates, patches, and the launch of the Phantom Liberty expansion that brought sweeping changes to the game. Compared to the version that first launched, Cyberpunk 2077 is almost unrecognizable thanks to all of its upgrades, a lean and mean open-world sci-fi experience that succeeds in making you feel like an Edgerunner with nothing to lose and everything to gain.</p><p>But getting to this point required serious introspection from developer CD Projekt Red as it faced negative reviews, player backlash, and a tarnished reputation. No studio wants to let their fans down, and for the developers in the trenches who poured their hearts and souls into the game, they knew that they had a long road ahead of them as they began focusing on improving Cyberpunk 2077.</p><div>          </div><p>"I think after the release, we did everything we could. Literally, everything we could," global art dire

<p>GameSpot's newest video series, Insider, launches today with a mini-documentary about CD Projekt Red and the development of Cyberpunk 2077. GameSpot traveled to CD Projekt Red's offices in Poland and spoke with members of the development team to hear directly from the people making the game about the RPG's struggles and eventual redemption.</p><p>In the video, the developers speak frankly about Cyberpunk 2077's numerous issues at launch in December 2020. These were major issues, and the game was even pulled from sale entirely on PlayStation for a period of time. The team discussed this how they responded to the issues and implemented a plan to help turn things around.

<p>Hard to believe that the Fallout franchise is about to turn 30 in a couple of years and it's finally being adapted into a live-action series for Prime Video <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazons-fallout-series-gets-spring-release-date/1100-6518561/">premiering in April</a>. In the upcoming series, it follows the story told in the games pretty well with nuclear war breaking out across Earth in the year 2077. In this world though, everything from clothes to the preferred types of entertainment, to even the style of vehicles adhere to a 1940s aesthetic.</p><p>Fans have been unsure of when the show takes place within the franchises' lore, but that has been clarified: this will be set 219 years after the war, taking place in the year 2296. That's nine years after the events of Fallout 4.
