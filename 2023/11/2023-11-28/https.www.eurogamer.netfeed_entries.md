Embracer Group CEO Lars Wingefors has reportedly confirmed to employees that TimeSplitters studio Free Radical is facing closure next month, as part of a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saints-row-owner-embracer-announces-comprehensive-restructuring-program-to-close-studios-cut-jobs">sweeping restructuring programme</a> that has already resulted in more than 900 job cuts at the company.

In news that'll surprise nobody who's been following the various leaks leading up to today's official announcement, Capcom has confirmed Dragon's Dogma 2 will launch for Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, and PC on 22nd March next year.
</p><p>
That date <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragons-dogma-2-release-date-seemingly-leaks-ahead-of-dedicated-showcase">first emerged earlier this month</a>, when it was spotted as part of a (quickly removed) listing on the PEGI ratings website. It then prematurely resurfaced on Steam today, getting a little ahead of Capcom's latest Dragon's Dogma 2 showcase where it was finally made official.
</p><p>
And official it now is, with Dragon's Dogma 2 director Hideaki Itsuno and producer Yoshiaki Hirabayashi confirming the news during a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T-C6OsUKvI">

CD Projekt has announced that Phantom Liberty, the first and only expansion for its sci-fi RPG Cyberpunk 2077, has sold 4.3m copies since launching this September - and that over 330 developers at the company are now working on the next Witcher game.
</p><p>
When last we heard from Phantom Liberty, CD Projekt revealed it had sold 3m copies in the first week of its release - news that was accompanied by updated sales figures for Cyberpunk 2077, which has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-sales-top-25m-cd-projekt-red-announces">now surpassed 25m copies sold</a> since its rocky launch back in December 2020.

Ubisoft's beleaguered pirate adventure Skull and Bones is - following yet another delay back in October - reportedly now targeting a 16th February release next year.
</p><p>
Skull and Bones has, of course, been a very long time in the making, with development starting over a decade a go on in 2013. Since then it's suffered repeated delays (it was originally expected to arrive in 2018), most recently seeing its release <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-pirate-adventure-skull-and-bones-delayed-again-now-due-early-2024">shift to Q4 of Ubisoft's current financial year</a>, meaning to a launch within the January-March 2024 period.
</p><p>
And that previous launch window looks to have been narrowed down to 16th February 2024 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/skull-and-bones-release-date-february/">according to Insider

## DF Weekly: Do we actually need The Last of Us Part 2 and Horizon Zero Dawn remasters?

DF Direct Weekly typically focuses on the week's gaming and technology news, but the latest episode actually kicks off with a story we missed from seven days prior: the announcement of The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered. Rumours have circled this project for months now and we've often wondered why Sony and Naughty Dog would embark on a remaster for a game that doesn't need remastering - and already has 60 frames per second support for PlayStation 5. Now, everything has come into focus but is it a worthwhile endeavour?
</p><p>
Well, with the details we now have in terms of features and pricing, I don't think there are any significant concerns remaining - just that perhaps that the term 'remastered' in the title is a little misplaced. Essentially, what we're dealing with here is broadly equivalent to a release along the lines of De

Some of the material which will feature in The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered's Lost Levels is also planned to appear in the second season of HBO's show, Naughty Dog's Neil Druckmann has teased. 
</p><p>
Earlier this month, Naughty Dog announced a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-part-2-is-getting-a-playstation-5-remaster-in-january">remastered and native PlayStation 5 version of The Last of Us Part 2</a>. Along with souped up visuals for the base game, this upcoming release will also have a few other bells and whistles including cut content in the form of 'Lost Levels' for players to experience. These Lost Levels will be Sewers, Jackson Party and Boar Hunt.

Meanwhile, almost in tandem with The Last of Us Part 2's remastered release, production on the seco

In the 1990s, the puckish, prolific Scottish author - who cheerfully hopscotched between publishing mainstream literary best-sellers as Iain Banks and science fiction novels as Iain M Banks - became so addicted to<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/25-years-of-civilization-we-talk-with-sid-meier" type="int"> Sid Meier's Civilization </a>that it threatened to short-circuit his writing career. Ultimately, he deleted the game from his hard drive in order to resist temptation. But the spirit of Civ - and other games - clearly bled into his work. </p><p>In Banks' bleak 1993 whodunnit Complicity, a speed-dabbing journalist juggles deadlines and sleuthing to maximise the hours he can pour into empire-building PC sim Despot, a "stunningly Machiavellian tu

Bethesda's customer support team has been responding to negative <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-guides-tips-tricks-9352">Starfield</a> reviews on Steam.

Starfield had a strong start, becoming the "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-hits-6m-players-to-become-biggest-bethesda-game-launch-ever">biggest Bethesda game launch</a>" of all time. Those numbers rose over the first few days of release, with Starfield's concurrent player count previously <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-overtakes-skyrim-with-concurrent-steam-players">beating Skyrim's concurrent player record on Steam</a>.

But despite these initial player numbers, Starfield currently sits with a 'Mixed' review status on Steam. At the time of writing, 69 percent of the game's 80,365 reviews on the platform are positive. The r
