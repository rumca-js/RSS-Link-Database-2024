<p>A new exhibition collates more 800 objects to give insight into the zine scene, a way to democratize art and journalism</p><p>A medium that basks in the unruliness and unpredictability of the creative process, zines are gloriously chaotic and difficult to pin down.

With over 800 objects on display, Copy Machine Manifestos is a crucial step toward documenting the zine scene, even if, in zine terms this show is a proverbial drop in the bucket.

It may sound momentary, but somehow it’s the gift that has been giving all year, from the box office nosedive of Marvel’s Ant-Man sequel to lower-than-expected international numbers for an expensive Little Mermaid remake to series-low grosses on Lucasfilm’s Indiana Jones sequel. This continued all the way to November, when The Marvels outright flopped and Disney’s 100th-birthday cartoon Wish opened to an underwhelming number. It marks the first year since 2014, pandemic era not included, that the company failed to produce one billion-dollar hit.</p><p>Financially speaking, the only bright spots were Elemental and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3, both of which held up following surprisingly soft opening weekends.

<p>Michael Schuls died after getting trapped in dangerous machinery at a mill in Wisconsin. But across the US conservative groups are pushing to loosen laws that protect children in the workplace</p><p>dIn late June, Jim Schuls and his 16-year-old son, Michael, woke up at 4am for their usual drive from their apartment in Florence, Wisconsin to begin work at 5am at a sawmill. Father and son made this journey together five times a week in the summer, when Michael worked longer hours than he did in term time. His two older brothers had also worked at the same mill when they were about his age.</p><p>Their day at Florence Hardwoods – one of the largest employers in the town with a population of about 2,000 – began as normal.

His new album, Accentuate the Positive, finds him going back to songs that he first played in Belfast bar bands as a teenager a full 60 years ago. Morrison has said that he had been intending to re-engage with these rock’n’roll and R&amp;B originals for more than 20 years. It was the Covid lockdown that gave him the headspace to tackle the project – somewhat ironic given that last year he put out an aggrieved album of conspiracy theory-fuelled Covid scepticism, What’s It Gonna Take?</p><p>Launching the album tonight, Morrison stands stage centre of his seven-piece band, wrapped in his trademark Panama hat and sunglasses. The striking first impression is how strong his voice remains at 78. C

<p>Family trip to Norway that falls prey to a killer gremlin isn’t silly or scary enough to provide much entertainment </p><p>You’re in Norway now. Nothing bad ever happens.” That’s an American dad reassuring his two kids, not long after they move to the Norwegian countryside to a farm he’s inherited. The plan is to convert the barn out back into a snug Airbnb rental. Trouble is, there’s a foul tempered <em>nisse</em> – or elf – living in the barn (a little fella, the size of a seven-year-old, with a pointy hat and scraggy long beard). So, yes, essentially this is a movie about killer garden gnomes. It’s a silly horror that’s not as good, or as bad, as you’d hoped: neither funny enough nor ever properly scary. That said, there are some cheerfully gory bits and a smattering of decent culture clash gags.</p><p>Actually, for the first few minutes I thought it was a kids’ film, which gives you an inkling as to the general approach – right up until a teenager dropped the f-word.

Gates has had a lifelong stammer, and speaking in a stressful situation was about as hard as it gets. “When I was stretched in every way, physically drained and exhausted, to then have to talk, which is my hardest thing in life, was tough,” he says. “And I was unearthing trauma and exposing scars I hadn’t spoken about before.”</p><p>In the show, which puts contestants through SAS training, Gates broke down, berating himself as he did (“I said I wouldn’t do this”).

<p>Even as some Tories are getting real about the issue, Labour is doubling down. It could try just being honest with the public</p><p>For months now, Keir Starmer has been at pains to tell the country that there are no easy answers to our problems. There is no magic money tree. We can’t spend what we haven’t got. We have to be realistic about the scorched earth a Labour government would inherit. This deliberate damping down of expectations doesn’t exactly make the heart sing, but it beats promising the earth to get elected and then trying awkwardly to wriggle out of it afterwards. What’s puzzling, however, is that this policy of brutally bursting voters’ bubbles never seems to be applied to immigration.</p><p>Last week’s Office for National Statistics figures, revising the net number of people coming to Britain in 2022 up to 745,000, were always going to induce apoplexy in the Conservative party, followed by the usual rhetoric about cutting the numbers in some draconian manner.

<p>Science Weekly brings you episode one of a new mini-series from Full Story.</p><p>Pioneering Australian scientists Graeme Pearman, Lesley Hughes and Ove Hoegh-Guldberg saw the climate crisis coming. Pearman predicted the increase of carbon dioxide levels, Hughes foresaw the alarming number of species extinctions and Hoegh-Guldberg forecast the mass coral bleaching events we’re seeing today. All three went on to become some of the country’s most respected experts in their fields, travelling the globe, briefing leaders, and assuming the world would take action having heard their alarming findings.</p><p>In part one of this three-part series, these climate scientists reveal the moment they realised the planet was heading for catastrophe. What did they do when they found out? How did they think the world would respond? And how do they feel today, looking back on that moment of cognisance?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/audio/2023/nov/28/episode-one-new-podcast-weight
