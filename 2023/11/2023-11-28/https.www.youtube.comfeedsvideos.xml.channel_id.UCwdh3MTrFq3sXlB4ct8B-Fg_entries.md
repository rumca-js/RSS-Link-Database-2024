In the worlds of Warhammer 40,000 and Warhammer Age of Sigmar, countless battles take place across snowy landscapes, which are often left covered in debris, blood and gore. Savage armies like the Flesh-Eater Courts and the Night Lords, in particular, are infamous for leaving truly gruesome scenes in their wake.

In this video, weâ€™ll create a blood-soaked snowy base for our Abhorrant Gorewarden. But remember, all the techniques we will show you can be used on any base for any model in your collection!
