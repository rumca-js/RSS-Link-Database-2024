Life’s shit, right?” David Holmes is in hospital, where he has been admitted countless times since being paralysed in an accident 14 years ago. The spinal injury that took away the use of his legs subsequently caused him to lose feeling in his right arm, and he is profoundly worried that the same is happening to the left arm, which a nurse is massaging. But he is more worried about the nurse: he knows she recently lost a friend to Covid, because he took the time to ask.</p><p>Holmes, now 40, was Daniel Radcliffe’s stunt double on the Harry Potter movies until he broke his neck during the filming of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1.

Beneath was an article devoted entirely to his hair transplant, which the <em>Times</em> pointed out, “conveys a meaningful message on mental health and motivation”, further proof that “struggles such as hair loss should not impede the path to success”. And who could disagree? Here we have Shami out there representing for the bald community, which he has also now abandoned by having a magnificent bristly new mane implanted.

His idea, set out in <em>The Principles of Scientific Management</em> (1911), was that every worker should be trained into new working habits “until he continually and habitually works in accordance with scientific laws, which have been developed by some one else”, such as managers or time-and-motion experts.</p><p>The f

<p>Charles ‘Chaz’ Nuttycombe, 24, is impressing analysts with his accurate forecasts of consequential state legislature elections</p><p>In the days after Democrats won control of Virginia’s state legislature, Charles “Chaz” Nuttycombe was focused on the results in house of delegates districts 41 and 82, both of which you’ve probably never heard of.</p><p>Neither of the competitive races would determine which party controlled the Virginia legislature, but it was one of a handful where votes were still being counted and the results too close to call. In the lead-up to election day, Nuttycombe, a 24-year-old senior at Virginia Tech, had predicted that the Republican candidates would win both. But his final forecast in Virginia gave Democrats a 61% chance of winning control of the house of delegates and a 71% chance of holding control in the state senate.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/nov/18/virginia-election-poll-college-student">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Six Group, which operates the Swiss and Spanish bourses, is a target for cyberwarfare and must be on guard, its boss says</p><p>Six Group counts its profit in millions, but the financial pipework it controls moves billions. Its operations, which include the Spanish and Swiss stock exchanges, count as critical national infrastructure and this gives it a close relationship with governments and regulators in Madrid and Zurich.</p><p>Those relationships are critical in an age where digital warfare makes financial infrastructure a prime target for hackers linked to hostile states. Jos Dijsselhof, the Dutch chief executive of the Swiss-based stock exchange group, is open about the scale of the challenge. “I employ a lot of hackers,” he says, tapping the table sharply. “Sometimes it takes one to know one.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/nov/18/i-employ-a-lot-of-hackers-how-a-stock-exchange-chief-deters-cyber-attacks">Continue reading...</a>

The difference lies in the fence that protects them. When there’s an owner, there’s economical use, and this protects the fauna.”</p><p>Lynch is a prominent supporter of Argentina’s far-right presidential candidate Javier Milei, a staunch advocate of privatisation of environmental assets. If the self-proclaimed “libertarian” candidate Milei wins the second round of the presidential election in Argentina on Sunday, Lynch will be among many with such views in his government.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/nov/18/argentina-e

<p>The new Nobel laureate’s latest novella is a shimmering fable about a man lost in a dark forest</p><p>One day in late autumn, a man goes for a drive so far into the countryside that he begins to pass no more dwellings of the living, only abandoned farmhouses and cabins. At last, he pulls into a forest and goes down a road so deeply rutted that the car finally becomes stuck. Night is falling. It has begun to snow. The man decides to leave his car and walk alone into the dark woods to try to find someone to help him.</p><p>This could be the beginning of a horror story; it is, instead, the opening of A Shining, a slim new novella by the Norwegian writer Jon Fosse, our <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/oct/05/jon-fosse-wins-the-2023-nobel-prize-in-literature" title="">2023 Nobel laureate in literature</a>, whose fiction rather astonishingly dissolves the border between the material and the spiritual worlds.

What happens when you release thousands of novel chemicals, most of which have not been tested for their impacts on human health or ecosystems, into a living planet?
