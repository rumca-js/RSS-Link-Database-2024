Tamoor is joined by Jeff Grubb to talk about how video game awards approach categorization and why it may need rethinking.

It's awards season, which means video game media outlets will be handing out accolades for their favourite experiences of the year. However, one award show stands tall as a major event that brings together the entire industry: The Game Awards.

Nominations for the show have been revealed, and it's sure to be an exciting ceremony. However, there has also been some discussion about how games are categorized and whether genre labels are as applicable now as they once were. A particular focus is the indie category, which features a game that looks indie in every way but has been created under the umbrella of a major publisher. 

Given how important The Game Awards is to the industry and the broader awareness around games, there is definitely a case to be made for taking a closer look at all this. So, Tamoor and Jeff Grubb do just that in this episode of Spot On.
