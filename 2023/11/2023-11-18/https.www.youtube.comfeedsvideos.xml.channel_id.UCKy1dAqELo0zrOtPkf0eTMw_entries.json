When you start hitting on the right combinations of difficulty, planning, and random chance, it leads to fun, intense moments that leverage some of the best ideas from both. But what's fun here is frequently undercut by way too much time spent grinding for gear needed to survive the intense enemies in the center of the map, busywork story objectives, and crashes that can kill any desire to play. Operation Deadbolt has great moments of tough battles full of panic and dread against gross monsters, but only if you're willing to put in a lot of time and effort to make them happen.\n\n#CallOfDutyModernWarfare3 #Zombies #CallOfDutyModernWarfare3Zombies", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjU5UNDHYic", "date_published": "2023-11-18T22:45:02+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "Ign - YouTube", "album": "Ign - YouTube", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/TjU5UNDHYic/hqdefault.jpg", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "title": "Atari 2600+ - Official Launch Trailer", "description": "The Atari 2600+ is a recreation of one of gaming\u2019s first home consoles created by Atari and PLAION.
