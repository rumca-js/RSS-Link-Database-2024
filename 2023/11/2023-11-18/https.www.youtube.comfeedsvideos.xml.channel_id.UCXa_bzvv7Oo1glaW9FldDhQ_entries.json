Nothing is amusing about a concussion or its long-term effects on health, and a broken arm is far from enjoyable. While video games don't do much to change that outlook, they can offer all the intricacies of injuries within a virtual space.\n\nIt may seem counterintuitive to have reduced movement speed or decreased accuracy when your legs and arms are hurt. However, for immersive sims, survival titles and massive sandboxes that painstakingly recreate everything (emphasis on \"pain\"), injuries can be indispensable to the experience.\n\nOf course, there's nothing wrong with cosmetic damage if it adds to the immersion. Check out 15 games with some of the most realistic injury systems and what makes them so.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D47qJl-bM1I", "date_published": "2023-11-18T15:30:04+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "GamingBolt", "album": "GamingBolt", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/D47qJl-bM1I/hqdefault.jpg", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "Ark Survival Ascended PS5 And Xbox Series X | S - 15 Things To Know BEFORE YOU BUY", "description": "Ark: Survival Ascended is available now for PC via Steam Early Access, and after a series of delays, it's coming to Xbox Series X/S soon and PS5 by the end of November.\n\nWhile initially seen as an upgraded version, this Unreal Engine 5.2 remaster boasts several features and quality-of-life improvements. Crossplay and cross-platform modding were previously announced and pretty big in their own right, but the UI, building, map system, mount tracking and much more have seen significant changes. Even the graphical improvements offer some new gameplay opportunities.\n\nHere's what you should know about Ark: Survival Ascended before picking it up on current-gen consoles and why you can't stick to Ark: Survival Evolved for the future (at least when playing online).", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qJfRgfMJoA", "date_published": "2023-11-18T13:30:04+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "GamingBolt", "album": "GamingBolt", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/8qJfRgfMJoA/hqdefault.jpg", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "15 Unreal Engine 5 Games That Look RIDICULOUSLY GOOD", "description": "The future of video game graphics is happening right now, with more and more games crafted inside Unreal Engine 5 seeing the light of day.
