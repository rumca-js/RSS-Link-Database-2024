Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 Zombies reviewed by Phil Hornshaw on PC, also available on Xbox and PlayStation.

Operation Deadbolt's attempt to reanimate Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3’s Zombies mode by merging it with the machinery of DMZ isn't always successful, but it's not an inherently bad idea. When you start hitting on the right combinations of difficulty, planning, and random chance, it leads to fun, intense moments that leverage some of the best ideas from both. But what's fun here is frequently undercut by way too much time spent grinding for gear needed to survive the intense enemies in the center of the map, busywork story objectives, and crashes that can kill any desire to play. Operation Deadbolt has great moments of tough battles full of panic and dread against gross monsters, but only if you're willing to put in a lot of time and effort to make them happen.

A Disturbance in the Force is a documentary unlike any other tailor-made for every and any Star Wars fan. Dealing with the infamous Star Wars Holiday Special, in 1977, "Star Wars" became a cultural phenomenon that single-handedly revitalized a stagnant film industry, and forever changed how films were sold, made, and marketed. In 1978, filmmaker George Lucas was talked into cashing in on the Star Wars craze by producing a holiday variety TV special. What could possibly go wrong? ANSWER: Everything… 

A Disturbance in the Force stars Seth Green, Weird Al Yankovic, Paul Scheer, Taran Killam, Patton Oswalt, Donny Osmond, Gilbert Gottfried, Bonnie Burton, Bruce Vilanch, and Steve Binder. The documentary is directed by Jeremy Coon and Steve Kozak with Kyle Newman serving as producers alongside Jeremy Coon and Steve Kozak as producers as well. Adam F. Goldberg is the executive producer of A Disturbance in the Force. 

A Disturbance in the Force is releasing on December 5 for Apple TV, Amaz

Scott Pilgrim Takes Off, reviewed by Erik Adams.

The sooner you watch Scott Pilgrim Takes Off, the less time you’ll spend worrying about spoilers, and the sooner you’ll get to enjoy a breathtaking reimagining of Bryan Lee O’Malley’s graphic novels. Even with the core cast of Scott Pilgrim vs. the World along for the ride, it’s no mere exercise in nostalgia, but a fresh coat of paint on a versatile coming-of-age story, whose vibrant animation and expanded scope bring new dimensions to the garage rockers, video-store clerks, ninja-couriers, and evil exes who inhabit “Toronto, Canada – Not Too Long Ago.”

Rick and Morty dropped a major episode for fans who watch Rick and morty week to week, season to season. (SPOILERS) Rick & Morty unexpectedly saw the return of Evil Morty and a storyline cultivated for years by Dan Harmon and Justin Roiland.

The real storyline in Rick and Morty, funny enough, may be just beginning. Rick and Morty S7 has touched on the multiverse several times and has now reintroduced both Rick Prime and Morty Smith, er, “Evil Morty” that is as the central finite curve concept comes back into play. It’s been a while since we’d visited the Rick and Morty central finite curve concept, what with Evil Morty stepping outside it all (check out our previous videos for both Rick and Morty explained and the Central Finite Curve explained). What’s the deal with Evil Morty? And will we ever have Evil Morty explained?? We’ve got you covered here on I
