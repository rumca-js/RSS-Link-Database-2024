  <p id="Mhnl91">Meta has reportedly broken up its Responsible AI (RAI) team as it puts more of its resources into generative artificial intelligence. <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/meta-breaks-up-its-responsible-ai-team"><em>The Information</em> broke the news</a> today, citing an internal post it had seen. </p>
<p id="XPNweV">According to the report, most RAI members will move to the company’s generative AI product team, while others will work on Meta’s AI infrastructure. The company regularly says it wants to develop AI responsibly and even <a href="https://ai.meta.com/responsible-ai/">has a page</a> devoted to the pr

  <p id="br4iX4">Google is racing headlong into the AI future, and that means different parts of the company are destined to collide with one another — Search is now generating AI-powered summary results, but flooding the web with AI-generated text is going to make search that much harder, for example. It’s going to be messy and complicated and fascinating all at the same time. In general, the parts of Google that are charged with <em>moderating platforms</em> (like YouTube and Search) are going to end up colliding with the parts of Google that help people <em>create content</em> (like Gmail and Bard.)

  <p id="c88eH5">SpaceX’s massive Starship rocket just took off shortly after 8AM ET from the company’s Starbase launch facility in Boca Chica, Texas. </p>
<p id="OIZYOm">A few minutes after the launch and a planned “hot stage” separation, the Super Heavy booster exploded instead of continuing its planned descent and water landing, but Starship itself continued into space. Minutes later, the SpaceX team said it had not received any signal from the booster and that they may have lost the ship. </p>
