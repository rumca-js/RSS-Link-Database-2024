China's central financial work conference just ended. The anti-espionage agency, the Ministry of State Security in China, immediately targeted the A-shares market and sternly warned the "four major shorters'' in the stock market, including those who “hold shorting views,” “speak shorting voices” and “conduct shorting activities.” It unprecedentedly elevated the security of the stock market to the height of national security. The official WeChat public account of the Ministry of State Security published a post on November 2 titled "State security agency serves as a firm guardian of financial security!" The article was widely shared by major Chinese media outlets.
