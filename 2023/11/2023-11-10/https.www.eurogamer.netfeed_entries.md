Netflix has revealed Doug Cockle - the gravelly voice of Geralt of Rivia in CD Projekt's The Witcher series - will be reprising his role as the silver-haired monster-bopper in a new animated movie coming to the streaming service "late" next year.
</p><p>
The Witcher: Sirens of the Deep, as the film is officially titled, begins with Geralt investigating a series of attacks in a seaside village. However, as answers are slowly revealed, Geralt finds himself drawn into a centuries-old conflict between humans and merpeople.
</p><p>
"He must count on friends &mdash; old and new," Netflix teases in its announcement, "to solve the mystery before the hostilities between the two kingdoms escalate into all-out war."

If you've been eagerly awaiting Nightdive Studios' Turok 3: Shadow of Oblivion remaster, you'll need to hang in there just a bit longer; the developer is delaying its release by a few weeks, with the dino FPS now coming to PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch on 30th November.
</p><p>
Nightdive's remastering of the original Turok trilogy - which was developed by the now-defunct Iguana Entertainment - has been quite the undertaking; the studio released its Turok 1 remaster eight years ago, back in 2015, and its sequel got the spruce-up treatment two years later. 
</p><p>
Nightdive's Turok 3 remaster - which will mark the first time the game has been available since its N64 debut in 2000 - promises to be similarly thorough, introducing enhanced environment art and character models, updated weapon models, plu

## Warner Bros. responds to Mortal Kombat 1 $10 Fatality outcry with two 'free' Fatalities

Warner Bros. has attempted to placate angry Mortal Kombat 1 players with two 'free' Fatalities following an outcry caused by the decision to introduce a $10 USD Fatality to the game's already heavily criticised premium store.
</p><p>
Despite being sold as a full-price &pound;59.99/$69.99 USD title, developer the latest entry in NetherRealm's long-running fighting series includes a rotational in-game shop selling store-exclusive cosmetics - including costumes and gear - only available to purchase with real-world money (Mortal Kombat 11 also enabled players to buy cosmetics, but these could largely also be earned in-game).
</p><p>
While the premium store has already drawn plenty of ire from Mortal Kombat players, things came to a head last month when Warner Bros. and developer NetherRealm began selling store-exclus

## Call of Duty will soon be disabling cheaters' parachute and causing deadly 10,000ft bunny hops

Whatever you might think of Call of Duty, you can't accuse its anti-cheat team of lacking imagination; having previously caused chaos for multiplayer cheaters by whisking away their weapons and turning opponents invisible, it'll soon be cutting their parachute chords and causing their bunny hops to launch them 10,000ft into the air before a very messy end.
</p><p>
This latest bit of mischief is the work of the team behind Call of Duty's server-side and kernel-level anti-cheat solution, officially known as Ricochet, which outlined its latest steps in the war against online ne'er-do-wells - particularly the role Machine Learning plays in improving its anti-cheat systems - in a <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2023/11/call-of-duty-ricochet-anti-cheat-modern-warfare-III-progress-report">timely blog

Mass Effect fans have been debating a recent claim that the next game in the series may not launch until 2029.
</p><p>
This week, Giant Bomb's Jeff Grubb suggested Mass Effect 5 would not arrive until near the end of the decade, based on insider knowledge and some back of the envelope maths based on the ongoing and protracted development of Dragon Age Dreadwolf.
</p><p>
Grubb's comments were predictably pounced upon by fans following a somewhat mixed response to this year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioware-teases-mass-effect-5-title-plus-answers-to-trilogy-ending-questions">annual Mass Effect franchise celebrations on 7th November</a> - N7 Day.

## Lords of the Fallen is a stunning UE5 Soulslike with ongoing tech issues

After all, this 2023 series reboot is a rare breed of next-gen project designed just for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, S and PC. Added to that, the game is built on Unreal Engine 5 with a heavy use of its Nanite and Lumen technologies. Developer Hexworks goes all-out here in its world-building and the UE5 features allow for intricately detailed gothic environments, lit by a hybrid ray-traced global illumination technique. Add in a realm-switching mechanic - in the tradition of Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver - and it makes sense that the game's ambition is perhaps beyond the scope of a last-gen console release.</p><p> In fact based o

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 released today, and it is pulling in some serious numbers for many internet service providers.

According to EE, BT and Virgin Media O2, the game's launch and pre-load period has seen record traffic across each of the networks.
</p><p>
In a new press release, Virgin Media O2 stated on Wednesday 8th November, when the game was available to pre-load, its broadband network "hit 25.1Tbps at peak (8-10pm)".

The Legend of Zelda creator Shigeru Miyamoto has admitted Nintendo faces "an extremely high hurdle" not to disappoint fans across the world with the forthcoming film.

Following the company's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-sales-pass-132m-as-nintendo-stays-silent-on-successor">latest earnings report</a>, Miyamoto and CEO Shuntaro Furukawa were asked about the risks of expanding IPs beyond video games, to which Miyamoto responded directly on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-is-working-on-a-live-action-the-legend-of-zelda-movie">Zelda live-action film that was announced during the report</a>.

Activision has claimed its Call of Duty HQ launcher provides easier file management and seamless switching between games, despite criticism from players.
</p><p>
Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3, the latest in the series, now launches from Call of Duty HQ alongside last year's Modern Warfare 2. Activision describes the launcher as "the front door for Call of Duty" and states "players have control over the footprint of their Call of Duty experience on their platform of choice, and it's all contained within one unified location".
</p><p>
In practice, however, it's confusing plenty of players and has resulted in huge file sizes - as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/activision-addresses-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3s-up-to-200gb-file-sizes">previously reported</a>, the install size of the complete package is

World of Warcraft director Ion Hazzikostas has confirmed there's "no long-term advantage" for players willing to pay for early access to the next expansion.

This week, a lot of people around the world have been rediscovering an old love. I've never really left Fortnite behind, but the game's original island has been out of reach for a couple of seasons now. Suddenly it's back and it's been fascinating to return to it - and fascinating to watch everyone else flood back in too.
</p><p>
Tom wrote a beautiful piece about what this all means for the game, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnites-huge-popularity-spike-is-both-brilliant-and-devastating">which you can read here</a>. I'm less analytical though, and also perhaps slightly more nostalgic for the era of Fortnite which I played the most regularly. So. When the OG game dropped I knew exactly where I was headed. I was going back to Loot Lake!

Loot Lake was the spot on the map I fell in love with after

Cor, there's a new GTA on the way! And while we're going to learn a bit more about it in December when the trailer drops for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> drops, we still wanted to get together and share a few thoughts about things we hope the new game includes.

This isn't a piece about the big stuff - we'll have a piece up next week on things like theme, satire, and stuff like that. This is more about the little stuff that, in a series like GTA, is often incredibly important. What's on the radio? What's happening on the other side of the car window? See what you think.

I'm increasingly convinced that the single thing that separates a great open world from a good one is space. Space in between a world's various bits and pieces. Space that tells
