Deep within every piece of magnetic material, electrons dance to the invisible tune of quantum mechanics. Their spins, akin to tiny atomic tops, dictate the magnetic behavior of the material they inhabit. This microscopic ballet is the cornerstone of magnetic phenomena, and it's these spins that a team of JILA researchers—headed by JILA Fellows and University of Colorado Boulder professors Margaret Murnane and Henry Kapteyn—has learned to control with remarkable precision, potentially redefining the future of electronics and data storage.

NASA will hold off sending commands to its Mars fleet for two weeks, from Nov. 11 to 25, while Earth and the Red Planet are on opposite sides of the sun. Called Mars solar conjunction, this phenomenon happens every two years. The missions pause because hot, ionized gas expelled from the sun's corona could potentially corrupt radio signals sent from Earth to NASA's Mars spacecraft, leading to unexpected behaviors.

## Divergent mechanisms of reduced growth performance in Betula ermanii saplings from high-altitude and low-latitude range

Plant species are distributed in their preferred climatic zones, and plants growing at the edge of their natural distribution range often exhibit poor growth when relocated to a different environment. This phenomenon has been attributed to two factors: 1) the environment at the edge of the distribution is extreme for the species, causing them to lose their adaptive ability in a different environment, and 2) the small size and isolation of the population make them susceptible to inbreeding and genetic drift. However, the specific mechanisms by which these two factors cause reduced growth have not been well understood.

## Preparation of F-passivated ZnO for quantum dot photovoltaics

For photovoltaic power generation, pn junction is the core unit. The electric field in the junction can separate and transport the electron and the hole to negative and positive electrodes, respectively. Once the pn junction is connected with a load and exposed to a light ray, it can convert photon power into electrical power and deliver this power to the load. This photovoltaic application has long been used as the power supply for satellites and space vehicles, and also as the power supply for renewable green energy.

The theory of relativity is at once simple and elegant but also maddeningly nonintuitive. There's no need to get into the full guts and glory of that theory here, but there is one feature of Einstein's work that takes center stage, and would eventually lead him into a complete reshaping of Newton's gravity, altering our very conceptions of the fabric of the universe.

For decades, marketers of consumer goods designed highly adorned packages, deploying bold colors, snazzy text, cartoons and illustrations to seize the attention of shoppers.

When the notion of "ecotourism" was introduced in the late 1970s, it was intended to be ecologically responsible, promote conservation, benefit local populations and help travelers foster a "reconnection with biocultural diversity." It's now more of a marketing term, used to give mass adventure-tourism packages a more "responsible" sheen. Visitors might get a nature walk, but interactions with local residents are limited to souvenir sellers at best, and international consortiums arrange everything and keep the profits for themselves.

Physical properties (stability, solubility, etc.), critical to the performance of pharmaceutical and functional materials, are known to strongly depend on the solid-state form and environmental factors, such as temperature and relative humidity. Recognizing that late appearing, more stable forms can lead to disappearing polymorphs and potentially market withdrawal of a life-saving medicine, the pharmaceutical industry has heavily invested in solid form screening platforms.

Lakes around the world emit methane to the atmosphere, accounting for up to 19% of total global emissions of this potent greenhouse gas. Most of the methane in lakes comes from microbes in the lake bed that consume dissolved organic matter for sustenance and release methane as a waste product. This process typically occurs in low-oxygen conditions; in environments with more oxygen, microbial metabolic processes that do not produce methane tend to dominate.
