For example, a bully might be projecting his own struggle with self-esteem onto the person they are bullying.</p><p>Typically, an unconscious discomfort can lead someone to attribute their feelings to someone else in an effort to avoid confronting them. </p><p>A perfect example of this is the new racist exhibit at the Vancouver Art Gallery called “Conceptions of White” and it’s worse than you may think. </p><p>Upon entering the gallery, guests are first met with a large phrase on the wall that reads, “When you’re the problem, we’re the solution.” The text is accompanied by a white man.</p><p>Yo

The responses to the biggest questions in life are often answered with mostly shallow, wrong, and weak beliefs.

In fact, one of the main components of progressivism is that those who disagree with them do not simply have a different perspective or opinion but anyone with a dissenting view is inherently evil. </p><p>One of the major problems with progressive morality is that you can never be woke enough. And the tide for what is acceptable just keeps moving further and further to the left. Basically, it's a slippery slope. </p><p>One of the leaders in the leftist

## Game respects game: It's hard not to admire John Fetterman's latest attempt to trigger pro-Hamas leftists

	Electorally, there is nothing we can do about John Fetterman until 2028. Until then, I'm content to sit back and revel in the content. It's not just that he supports Israel over Hamas, to the dismay of the pro-Hamas Democrat base. It's that he actively tries to troll the base in doing so.
</p><p>
	And HE, John Fetterman, is doing it. Not someone who can construct sentences posting messages on X for him. It's getting to the point where I give it until next month before CNN or the AP has an article quoting "experts" who claim Fetterman's signs of brain damage after the stroke have other "experts" concerned if he can effectively do his job. Or if he even understands what he's doing when he supports Israel.
</p><p>
	Side note: I thought his "I had a stroke" bars were pretty damn funny.

Something that is so transparent and illustrates how little self-respect journalismers have for themselves, you can't be mad at it. NBC News dropped a deuce this week. The first was fact-checking Ron DeSantis for rescuing Americans from Israel <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/nbc-desantis-israel" target="_blank">because he didn't fly the plane himself</a>. The second is this bit using Nikki Haley's daughter.</p><p>At the debate this week, Vivek Ramaswamy brought up Haley's 25-year-old daughter in a political attack. It was smug, tacky, weak. One thing I don't bend on is that politician's kids that haven't entered the arena are off limits. Don't care about the political party. Ron DeSantis was asked about that debate moment and a
