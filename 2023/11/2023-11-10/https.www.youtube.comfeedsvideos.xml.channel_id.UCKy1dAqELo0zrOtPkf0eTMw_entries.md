Between massive leaks, rumors, and even FBI investigations, the story of how GTA 6 has been going on long before there was any official announcement. Now that we have confirmation that a Grand Theft Auto 6 trailer is coming in early December, let‚Äôs take a look at everything we know so far.

It‚Äôs been nearly a decade since the first launch of Grand Theft Auto 5, and we already know a lot about the sequel before we‚Äôve ever seen official footage. According to now pretty well-substantiated rumors, there seems to be two playable bank robber protagonists (one male and one female) in the style of Bonnie and Clyde. The rumored location also seems to be Miami, just like Vice City, with more locations to be added at a later date.

Check out the first 11 minutes of gameplay of Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name in 4K on Xbox Series X!

This newest entry in the Like a Dragon series (formerly known as Yakuza in the U.S.) is a sidestory featuring series protagonist Kazuma Kiryu, a few years after Yakuza 6: The Song of Life. It brings back the brawler gameplay from the original series instead of the turn-based RPG battle system of Yakuza: Like a Dragon. This time, Kiryu has access to the Spider Gadget, a special thread that comes out of his watch that you can use to grab weapons and enemies.

Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare is still the best Call of Duty campaign. Let‚Äôs remember Call of Duty‚Äôs finest hour and the game that laid the foundations for the shooter‚Äôs contemporary image: the original Call of Duty Modern Warfare. 16 years later, it remains Call of Duty's single-player highpoint and the series‚Äô most accomplished campaign.

What do you think is the best CoD campaign? Let us know in the comments!

Why is Avatar Frontiers of Pandora first person? We spoke to the developers of the upcoming action-adventure game to find out why they chose first-person instead of third-person perspective. 

While many players were hoping for a third-person Avatar game, hopefully this video explains why Massive Entertainment opted for a different route. And, having played two hours of it for our recent preview, I genuinely think the perspective works to properly anchor you into the strange, beautiful world of Pandora.

Masters of the Air is an Apple TV+ nine-episode limited series based on Donald L. Miller‚Äôs book of the same name, and scripted by John Orloff. The series follows the men of the 100th Bomb Group (the ‚ÄúBloody Hundredth‚Äù) as they conduct perilous bombing raids over Nazi Germany and grapple with the frigid conditions, lack of oxygen, and sheer terror of combat conducted at 25,000 feet in the air. Portraying the psychological and emotional price paid by these young men as they helped destroy the horror of Hitler‚Äôs Third Reich, is at the heart of ‚ÄúMasters of the Air.‚Äù Some were shot down and captured; some were wounded or killed. And some were lucky enough to make it home. Regardless of individual fate, a toll was exacted on them all.

Masters of the Air stars Austin Butler, Callum Turner, Anthony Boyle, Nate Mann, Rafferty Law, Barry Keoghan, Josiah Cross, Branden Cook, and Ncuti Gatwa. The executive producers are Steven Spielberg, Tom Hanks, and Gary Goetzman with John Orloff as the writ
