I've never really left Fortnite behind, but the game's original island has been out of reach for a couple of seasons now. Suddenly it's back and it's been fascinating to return to it - and fascinating to watch everyone else flood back in too.\n</p><p>\nTom wrote a beautiful piece about what this all means for the game, <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnites-huge-popularity-spike-is-both-brilliant-and-devastating\">which you can read here</a>. I'm less analytical though, and also perhaps slightly more nostalgic for the era of Fortnite which I played the most regularly. So. When the OG game dropped I knew exactly where I was headed.

And while we're going to learn a bit more about it in December when the trailer drops for <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357\">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> drops, we still wanted to get together and share a few thoughts about things we hope the new game includes. \n</p><p>\nThis isn't a piece about the big stuff - we'll have a piece up next week on things like theme, satire, and stuff like that. This is more about the little stuff that, in a series like GTA, is often incredibly important. What's on the radio? What's happening on the other side of the car window? See what you think.\n</p><p>\nI'm increasingly convinced that the single thing that separates a great open world from a good one is space. Space in between a world's various bits and pieces.
