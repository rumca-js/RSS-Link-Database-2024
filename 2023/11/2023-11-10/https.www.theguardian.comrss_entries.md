And people said Ten Hag couldn’t turn Manchester United into Ajax.</p><p>In one sense, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/nov/08/copenhagen-manchester-united-champions-league-match-report" title="">the 4-3 defeat against Copenhagen</a> was of a piece with United’s season to date: calamity snatched from the jaws of promise, an inability to defend simple crosses, an unswerving determination to step on whatever rakes were strewn in their path.

<p>A turbo-charged whiskey and ginger sort of Irish mule with pomegranate – craic on</p><p>I perfected this recipe at my favourite Irish festival, <a href="https://bodyandsoul.ie/">Body &amp; Soul</a>. I had spent the previous day lashing back the whiskey and ginger ale, and wanted a slight variation for my boozy diet the day after. Seeing some pomegranate juice, white wine and lime juice, I got stuck in and mixed up a couple of litres to carry back to the festival grounds for a second round of turbo-craic. Essentially, the recipe is one part whiskey, one part dry white wine, one part pomegranate juice and two parts ginger beer, plus the juice of half a lime for each serve. Ginger beer has more spice and heat than ginger ale, so do try to seek it out, but if you can’t get it, by all means use ginger ale instead.</p><p>This is an edited extract from Irish Kitchen Cocktails: 60 Recipes You Can Make at Home with Everyday Equipment, by Oisín Davis, published by Nine Bean Rows Books at £1

<p>Does older always mean better? As ever, it all depends … Our wine expert guides you through the potholed landscape of vintages</p><p>Unless you’re amassing a wine collection (no, me, neither), you probably don’t pay a whole lot of attention to vintages, but, while their importance can be overstated, it can be useful to know what to expect. You’re no doubt aware that the southern hemisphere harvests six months ahead of Europe, so their 2023 vintages are already on the shelves. Is it too soon to buy them, though? Depends what you’re shopping for: it suits sauvignon blanc and bright breezy reds, but is less good for more complex wines.</p><p>And what about those older vintages that you often find on sale at this time of year? Does older always mean better? Not necessarily, because they may already be dried out. A lot has to do with price. More recent releases are by and large better for cheaper whites and reds, but once you’re spending more than £12, say, an earlier vintage may offer

<p>Adivasis in Banteji say they also face arrests, violence and harassment by police and company officials</p><p>For months, they have been living in fear. The people of Banteji, a small tribal village amid the rolling green mountains deep in India’s Odisha state, have lived here for generations. Yet now most only return home for essentials and spend the night sleeping in the jungle. The police raids and violence, they say, could come again at any time.</p><p>Like so many of India’s tribal communities, known as Adivasis, the people here in the district of Rayagada live in extreme poverty, with little access to education and healthcare. The jungle and hills that surround them also sustain them, as they have done for hundreds of years, providing food, livelihoods, medicines, materials to build their homes and places to graze their animals. These mountains are also their gods.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/nov/10/indian-villagers-fear-torture-fight-bauxite-mi

<p><strong>Royal Court theatre, London<br /></strong>A trust-fund kid losing his family castle to an oligarch provides enough satire for some strong performances, but the concept is overstretched</p><p>Rory Mullarkey’s eat-the-rich comedy attempts to illuminate the ridiculousness of Britain and the unfailing bias towards the unaccountable upper classes. But it does so with a style that rarely wavers from a grating hamminess, leaving you hoping the rich will get eaten much faster than the run time promises.</p><p>Sending up the cares and customs of the super wealthy, the play focuses on a demanding posh kid in his “lad pad” in Chelsea. Laurie Kynaston is the rotten, spoilt viscount Theodore “Tug” Bungay, told by his mother Lady Agrippina (a sniffy, dispassionate Fenella Woolgar) that he’s being cut off and his beloved countryside castle is being sold to an on-the-run Russian oligarch.

<p>Garlic from the garden has a punchier smell, juicier texture and a taste that hits the tongue</p><p>After tasting homegrown garlic for the first time, I came up with a theory. I think famous chefs have access to really great garlic, which is why the rest of us have to use double, triple or quadruple the number of supermarket-bought cloves to get the flavour we’re after. With a punchier smell, juicier texture and a taste that hits the tongue with a kick, homegrown garlic is many orders of magnitude more delicious than the bulbs most of us can get hold of.</p><p>Garlic is an easy crop to grow, though it takes a while to transform from a clove (you grow next year’s garlic bulbs from this year’s cloves) into a bulb, and now is a great time to get them planted. There are two main types of garlic: soft neck produces small cloves, will keep for many months and, as the name suggests, is the kind of garlic that can be plaited together; hardneck is hardier, so good for cold areas. They prod

<p>A ceramic pot or two. A few sprigs of eucalyptus. White books as a plinth. And absolutely no kids’ paintings. When did shelves become more about status than storage?</p><p>My induction into the world of “stealth wealth shelves” began while I was house-hunting last winter. It was the 43rd place we’d viewed, and over-budget – but I was grabbed by the photos on Zoopla: the pink pendant light, terracotta-tiled kitchen and, most intriguingly, a shelf of carefully spaced out artful ceramics and strangely shaped vases. Up close, this shelf resembled an installation. Yet I had the strange feeling I’d seen it all before.</p><p>This past year, fashion has been dominated by a look known as “stealth wealth”. These clothes don’t use branding in the traditional way – flashy logos, say, or monograms. Instead, they rely on insider knowledge, an “if you know, you know” fabric or colour, to hint at their value. See the navy <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2021/dec/03/baseball-caps-are-

<p>Anyone can watch birds – from iridescent starlings to the gulls that steal chips – and it always brightens up a grey day</p><p>When I was a little boy growing up on the banks of the Nile in Sudan, my favourite bird was the weaver bird. The locals called them birds of paradise because they’re beautiful colours, and they weave their little nests up in the trees. Sometimes a nest will fall down and the kids will play football with it. But eight-year-old me had so many questions: where do they go for six months of the year? How do they take their food with them? A lot of farmers in Africa would time the sowing of their seeds by the arrival of particular birds, knowing that when they leave, that’s harvest time. We all used to be much more connected to nature at one point, and I think it’s sad how little most people these days get outdoors.</p><p>People are sometimes surprised when I say my favourite bird in Britain is the starling.

<p>It’s comfortable, affordable, looks great – and you’ve probably seen it everywhere already</p><p>The It bag of the season doesn’t have a designer label or a logo. (You can invest in a swanky version if you really want to, but the most popular version can be picked up for less than £15.) The bag of the season doesn’t even have a name; it has a shape – the half moon. I’ve heard people talk about the lemon-slice bag (which sounds pleasingly cocktail-hour-ish) or the croissant bag (the spirit of the Fendi Baguette lives on) but half moon makes the most sense, because that is all there is to this bag, really – just a graphic outline, like the moon seen from Earth.<br /><br />You have already seen this bag everywhere, by the way.

<p>A young playwright borrows inspiration from the breakdown of her sister’s marriage in a novel filled with hard decisions </p><p>Playing Games, Huma Qureshi’s fourth book and first novel, could have shared a title with her 2021 short story collection, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/nov/17/things-we-do-not-tell-the-people-we-love-by-huma-qureshi-review-a-fine-debut" title="">Things We Do Not Tell the People We Love</a>. Told through the lives of two sisters, Hana and Mira, born two years apart, this poignant and impressionistic book about the often blurred boundaries between life and literature asks what – and why – we hold back from those who know us best.</p><p>Hana wants to be a mother but is stuck in a failing marriage. Mira wants to be a writer but is stuck with writer’s block, living in a shitty flatshare.

<p>The teenage Chelsea defender, on loan at Bristol City, opens up on the moment that changed her life and her aim to captain England</p><p>“Both my legs kind of went numb, and I just couldn’t really walk on them,” says Brooke Aspin, one of England’s most promising young footballers. She is recalling just one of many harrowing moments she experienced last year when what initially appeared to be a muscle pull in her groin drastically worsened.</p><p>In August 2022, Aspin had gone to support her team, Bristol City, for their first game of the Championship season against Coventry. It was, she says, “one of the worst decisions”. She was sick during the bus journey. At Coventry’s ground, she had to use crutches to climb the steps. “It took me about 20 minutes to get up there,” she says. “But, yeah – and then that was a bit of a traumatic time.” After she got home, Aspin’s mum took her to hospital. What happened next was beyond what Aspin, or anyone else around her, had imagined.</p> <a hr

<p>The actor plays a dull academic whose image somehow arrives in millions of sleeping minds in a combination of Freddy Krueger and Leonard Zelig</p><p>Nicolas Cage has perhaps never been Nicolas Cagier in what could be his Nicolas Cagiest performance ever. This is a surreal fantasy-satire about the unsafe space of social media and the nature of viral fame, something to be aspired to – or dreamed of – by everyone: the democratised and accessible stardom that can happen to anyone, despite or in some way because of their lack of achievement. This kind of fame can be alchemised from ordinariness, a fame produced and consumed on smartphones and capable of getting inside people’s heads because they can imagine, in fact want to imagine, the same thing happening to them.</p><p>Cage plays Professor Paul Matthews, an academic with a decent but unexciting career lecturing on biology and how animals evolve to avoid the mortal danger of standing out from the herd. Cage shows us a dull guy, baldi

<p>As Las Vegas prepares to host its first Formula One race in more than 40 years, photographer Andy Hall celebrates the city’s original street of dreams</p><p>Las Vegas, especially to outsiders, is a city that embodies the get-rich-quick ideals of the American dream, and this year this most American of cities will host a Formula One race for the first time since 1982. But over the last 40 years since the last race was held there, Las Vegas has become two separate entities – at opposite ends of the famed Las Vegas Boulevard.</p><p>From its infancy until the mid-20th century, the only Vegas was downtown Vegas. Downtown Vegas at the northern end of Las Vegas Boulevard was where gambling began and the Las Vegas myths were made. In fact downtown <em>is</em> Las Vegas. The Strip, where the Formula One cars will be racing, is actually outside the city limits.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/nov/10/downtown-las-vegas-a-photo-essay-photographer-andy-hall">Continue

<p>In one well-to-do London street, eagerness to make the shift from boilers is dampened by worries about disruption and hidden costs</p><p>As a snapshot of bourgeois Britain, Park House Gardens would be hard to beat. A quiet cul-de-sac of 1930s art deco semis in the south-west London borough of Twickenham leads down to the River Thames. The street’s residents include architects and artists, local authority safeguarding administrators and NHS chief operating officers.</p><p>On paper, it should be the simplest of tasks for Colin Thomas, head of service delivery at Octopus energy, to sell the idea of switching from gas boilers to air source heat pumps here. The people who live in Park House Gardens know all about climate change and want to do their bit in the battle to achieve carbon net zero. And with homes changing hands for about £1.5m, they generally do not have to count every penny.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/nov/10/heat-pumps-installation-twickenham

<p>Turbines can ‘steal’ energy from those downwind and neighbouring projects could lead to conflicts of interest </p><p>Europe could theoretically produce all of its electricity needs from offshore wind power. With that objective, the continent’s coastal nations are leasing out large parts of their waters. But too dense a forest of turbines could become an economic problem. As the blades of each individual turbine go round, they take <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308597X2300430X">strength out of the wind</a>, researchers have found. The blades harvest energy that is then converted into electricity. The net result is that downwind blades will not be turning as fast; the energy otherwise available from the wind can be cut 20% as far as 50km away.</p><p>This drop will be enough to make some windfarms uneconomical, especially with construction costs rising and profit margins being squeezed.
