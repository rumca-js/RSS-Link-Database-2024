Straight ahead are six doorways \u2014 six different ways to explore the museum. Music. Art. Technology. History. Science. Sports. No matter what doorway you choose, there\u2019s math on the other side. Tracy Drinkwater, a long-time math educator with roots in the Seattle area, is working to make that museum a reality with the Seattle Universal Math Museum. The 4-year-old nonprofit is built around the core notion that every person is a math person \u2014 but we all experience math in different ways.

Oh right, Microsoft Skinput! As shown in the video below, from 2010, Skinput was a research project that projected light onto a user&#8217;s skin, using sensors to distinguish among the waves that run through the arm or hand to detect different inputs.
