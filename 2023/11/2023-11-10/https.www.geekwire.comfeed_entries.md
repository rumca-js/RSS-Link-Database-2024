Straight ahead are six doorways — six different ways to explore the museum. Music. Art. Technology. History. Science. Sports. No matter what doorway you choose, there’s math on the other side. Tracy Drinkwater, a long-time math educator with roots in the Seattle area, is working to make that museum a reality with the Seattle Universal Math Museum. The 4-year-old nonprofit is built around the core notion that every person is a math person — but we all experience math in different ways. That’s where music, art, technology, history, science&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/seattle-nonprofit-wants-to-help-all-students-love-math-using-school-programs-and-in-person-exhibits/">Read More</a>

That was my first thought upon reading this week&#8217;s coverage of the new Ai Pin from the startup Humane, with features including the ability to project an interface onto the palm of the user&#8217;s hand. Oh right, Microsoft Skinput! As shown in the video below, from 2010, Skinput was a research project that projected light onto a user&#8217;s skin, using sensors to distinguish among the waves that run through the arm or hand to detect different inputs. Developed in partnership with Chris Harrison of Carnegie Mellon University, the Skinput project proved once again the&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/flashback-microsofts-skinput-research-project-in-2010-foreshadowed-an-ai-gadget-of-2023/">Read More</a>

Starfish had to abandon its plan to regroup and attempt a rendezvous when the Otter Pup satellite&#8217;s electric propulsion thruster suffered an anomaly and could no longer function. &#8220;We determined that we just pushed it a little bit too far,&#8221; Starfish co-founder Austin Link told GeekWire. The months-long drama began shortly after Otter Pup&#8217;s launch aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket in June, when&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/starfish-space-scrubs-otter-pup-satellite-rendezvous/">Read More</a>

Microsoft cited &#8220;security and data concerns&#8221; in an update on an internal website as it cut off AI tools such as ChatGPT for employee use, CNBC reported. But the lockout was brief and apparently not intended, and was related to a large language model test being conducted by Microsoft. &#8220;We were testing endpoint control systems for LLMs and inadvertently turned them on for all employees,&#8221; a Microsoft spokesperson&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/chatgpt-or-not-chatgpt-that-was-the-question-briefly-as-microsoft-cut-employee-access-to-ai-tool/">Read More</a>

Today&#8217;s report suggest that Amazon&#8217;s Project Kuiper team &#8212; which is headquartered in Redmond, Wash. &#8212; is on track in its multibillion-dollar effort to create a 3,236-satellite constellation that would eventually provide broadband internet access for&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/202
