<p>Crowds of people marched through the centre of Jenin on Friday for the funerals of Palestinians killed during a raid by the Israel Defence Forces (IDF). As the Israeli offensive in Gaza continues, after the Hamas attack that killed 1,400 Israelis, violence in the occupied West Bank is escalating. Nineteen Palestinians were killed across the territory on Thursday as clashes took place with the IDF. According to Israeli media quoting IDF statements, the IDF launched a counter-terrorism operation during which forces exchanged fire with armed terrorists. Jenin has long been a flashpoint between Hamas and Israeli security forces, outside the practical control of the Palestinian Authority in Ramallah and a stronghold of Hamas and Islamic Jihad.</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/10/funerals-for-west-bank-dead-jenin-israel-hamas-war">‘Our wish is to be martyred’: defiant Hamas fighters count their losses in West Bank</a></p></li></ul><ul><li><p><a href="htt

<p>In-form strikers meet in clash of national stars after Wolves got a taste this week of how Hwang is feted in his homeland</p><p>It is a surreal Monday morning at Wolves’ training ground. The sight of the South Korea icon Park Ji-sung and Patrice Evra – best friends since their days at Manchester United – serving drinks and Korean delicacies from a coffee truck plastered with prints of Hwang Hee-chan is enough to trigger a few double takes. “If the coffee is not good, he is the person you blame … I’m just mixing the water,” Evra says, pointing at Park and breaking into that booming, infectious laugh.</p><p>Throughout the day first-team players and club staff queue to order food – choco pies and rice cookies from Taegeukdang, the oldest bakery in Seoul, prove a big hit – and drink coffee from cups decorated with a sticker of Hwang celebrating scoring for Wolves, something that has become commonplace this season.

Masterminded by Mao Zedong in 1966, its goal was to rid the country of dissenters, silence his political rivals and distract from his own often disastrous policies. The Maoist ideology led students to denounce their teachers, children to report their parents and neighbours to turn on neighbours. Millions were tortured or banished to rural farms and “re-education” camps, and up to 2 million people were killed.</p><p>In Red Memory, which has won the 2023 Cundill History pri

<p>The Tamil version of David Cronenberg’s A History of Violence is wildly enjoyable, packed full of hyenas, car chases, fight scenes and, of course, song and dance</p><p>In 1997, John Wagner and Vince Locke published their superb graphic novel A History of Violence: it was the story of an apparently regular guy, a small town Michigan cafe owner, whose unexpectedly accomplished defence of his family during an attempted robbery hints at a dark past which eventually turns out to involve mob entanglements. In 2005, David Cronenberg adapted the novel into the splendid Viggo Mortensen vehicle of the same name, which – Aragorn aside – may represent Mortensen’s finest hour. Now, this new Tamil version has broken several box office records and, at two hours 40 minutes runtime, has plenty of scope to expand on its source material – especially in the 18-certificate “uncut” version which has just entered cinemas.</p><p>The film opens with the small town of Theog in the snowbound western Himalay
