		Digital identities have been hailed as a means for authentication that could solve difficult issues and usher in a new era of digitalization across the world. But technology alone cannot solve digital identity. In order to achieve the hoped-for benefits, digital IDs will need standards and regulations.

After day one of the <a href="https://thefutureidentity.com/events/future-identity-festival/">Future Identity Festival 2023</a> saw <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202311/business-models-fraud-and-decentralized-digital-ids-future-identity-festival-day-1">discussions </a>on business models, fraud, and decentralized solutions, speakers gathered in London for day two to discuss policy issues and attempts to integrate digital IDs into payments and financial services.

		<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/onfido">Onfido</a> announced the launch of its Fraud Lab along with the publication of the <a href="https://onfido.com/landing/identity-fraud-report/">2024 Identity Fraud Report</a>.

The report argues that the 3,000 percent increase in deepfake attempts and a fivefold increase in digitally forged identities in 2023 is due to the increasing availability of user-friendly generative AI tools. But businesses are using <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202305/onfido-selfie-biometrics-integrated-by-salesforce-as-kyc-signup-pace-sustains">biometric verification</a> powered by deep learning to deter deepfakes, combating AI-powered attacks with AI.

		The sausage-making behind the EU's proposed AI Act is nearing its end and yet the legislation appears to have reached a point of ultimate precariousness.

In fact, according to one report, any single policy – including the use of remote public systems for <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202309/biometric-surveillance-will-be-debated-until-the-final-stages-of-ai-act">biometrics identification</a> – <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202310/ai-act-exemptions-cut-outs-and-broad-mandates-top-issues-late-in-bills-negotiations">could threaten</a> the proposed risk-based AI Act's survival.

		Never mind that enhanced border security plan between the EU and U.S. to share the biometric and other personally identifying data of European residents.

Instead, it seems that United States officials will have to negotiate shared identity databases with each EU member state. That sharing has been going on, but the new plan would mean continuous and systematic transfers of biometrics to the U.S.

And the numbers involved in the joint international border program – the Enhanced Border Security Partnership – are startling, <a href="https://www.statewatch.org/news/2023/november/usa-seeks-bilateral-deals-for-access-to-european-criminal-terrorist-and-identity-records/">according to</a> an analysis by civil liberties advocate Statewatch.

		New Zealand’s government has selected <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/daon-inc">Daon</a> to provide face biometrics checks for identity verification to access financial support through the Ministry of Social Development (MSD).

The Identity Check is provided by the Department of Internal Affairs, and compares selfie biometrics to a reference image used for the applicant’s driver’s license or passport.

Daon handles the data, so MSD does not collect people’s photos or biometrics, and the agency says the checks meet its Security, Privacy, Human Rights and Ethics Framework (SPHRaE).

People who do not want to use the facial authentication-based Identity Check service can bring an ID into a service center for in-person identity verificat

		Integration is the name of the game for <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/secureauth">SecureAuth</a>’s new access management and digital ID authentication platform, Arculix, announced today in a release. Featuring an enhanced orchestration engine and expanded integrations with Citrix and Microsoft Entra ID, it streamlines and harmonizes interactions between disparate security tools like a conductor turning individual parts into a symphony.

SecureAuth’s <a href="https://www.secureauth.com/resource/state-of-authentication-report/">research</a> shows that 84 percent of IT and security professionals name authentication and access management as a top five security priority. However, Paul Trulove, CEO of SecureAuth, says that the complex needs o

		<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/nec-corporation-of-america-irving-tx">NEC America</a> has announced an agreement with Ideal Innovations Inc. to facilitate training for the responsible use of facial recognition in forensics. It also released a post on use cases for its ID verification in social media.

The partnership with biometric forensics services provider <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/ideal-innovations-inc">Ideal Innovations Inc.</a> (I3) is intended to provide training and operational support to promote the responsible use of facial recognition systems in criminal investigations.

		An investigation by Disclose has turned up emails showing that French national police have been using facial recognition for eight years, despite a national prohibition on use of the biometric systems by law enforcement.

“In 2015, law enforcement authorities secretly acquired surveillance video image analysis software from the Israeli company BriefCam. For eight years, the Ministry of the Interior has concealed the use of this tool, which enables facial recognition,” says the <a href="https://disclose.ngo/en/article/the-french-national-police-is-unlawfully-using-an-israeli-facial-recognition-software">Disclose report</a>.

		3D virtual world game Avakin Life is now using <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/yoti">Yoti</a>'s age assurance to have adult players verify their age before accessing 18+ game features. Players who are suspected to be prompted to verify their age.

Lockwood Publishing, the developer behind the game, is implementing age assurance software to enhance privacy and safety on the platform, choosing Yoti's tool because it is user-friendly and highly accurate, according to the announcement.

Players can verify their age either by using Yoti's <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202307/friction-grows-over-age-estimating-software-and-policies-for-gaming">facial age estimation</a> software for biometric analysis or by uploading an identity document. The age estimatio

		The way some biometric systems are being used to determine the age of African migrants and refugees is being criticized in Spain.

A representative of the Spanish Network for Immigration and Refugee Assistance <a href="https://www-laprovincia-es.translate.goog/canarias/2023/11/10/ayuda-refugiado-cuestiona-fiabilidad-pruebas-94476713.html?_x_tr_sl=es&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp">told</a> local news outlet La Provincia that the government should not be using Western standards when estimating a minor's age using biometrics.

Using radiological means to analyze the hand and wrist bones apparently is acceptable, and, in fact, not all people are tested by their bones. But different criteria are needed when examining Western and African subjects, advocates hav

		Homelessness is not a single problem, but a confluence of many social issues and challenges – not the least of which is safe and reliable identification. Most of us take ID for granted, but thousands of people across Canada live for years without government ID, which puts limits on how, where and when they can receive support or access critical services like banking and job opportunities. Replacement IDs cost money and often come with complicated requirements. Several shelters and organizations have dabbled in biometrics as a possible solution. But larger initiatives have not yet taken hold.

There are reasons for this, says Myra Hewson, who works as a nurse providing low-barrier care at Toronto’s <a href="https://streethealth.ca/about-us/">Street Health</a>. She says thos
