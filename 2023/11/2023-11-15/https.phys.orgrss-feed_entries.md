A new study of house finches led by Marissa Langager, a Ph.D. student in the Department of Biological Sciences in the College of Science, has uncovered a surprising result. Unlike other social animals who passively or actively isolate themselves when sick, this gregarious backyard bird species gravitates toward healthy flock mates when they are sick, even more so than healthy birds do.

Even though they're the largest animals on earth, whales remain difficult to track. So experts often turn to historical whaling data to inform current research. A dataset maintained by the International Whaling Commission (IWC) contains detailed information on commercial whale catches—more than 2.1 million records, predominantly from 1880 until the IWC banned whaling in 1986. Yet for researchers, distilling that data can prove its own challenge.

Every tree species has its story. Unraveling all 73,000 of them is a significant undertaking for science, in no small part because a considerable proportion of tree biodiversity is tropical, rare, remote and subject to the ravages of deforestation. And an estimated 9,200 tree species have yet to be discovered.

Bile salts play a crucial role in the digestion and absorption of dietary fats in the small intestine, particularly in the duodenum. The human bile salt export pump (BSEP), also known as ABCB11, mediates a variety of bile salts transport into canaliculi against a steep concentration gradient in the enterohepatic circulation. BSEP dysfunction, caused by mutations or induced by drugs, is frequently associated with severe cholestatic liver disease.

Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest types of cancers in humans. It is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the western world. The early stages of the disease often progress without symptoms, so diagnosis is usually very late. Another problem is advanced tumors—and their metastases—can no longer be completely removed. Chemotherapies, in turn, attack not only the tumor cells but also healthy cells throughout the body.

A little like humans, the nuclei of atoms tend to shrink as they lose weight. But atomic nuclei are complex quantum systems formed from neutrons and protons that are themselves composite particles made of quarks. As such, their usually spherical or nearly spherical shapes do not always simply shrink as particles are removed from their interior. In fact, exotic, neutron-deficient mercury and bismuth nuclei have been seen to alternate dramatically from football (soccer) shapes to rugby ball shapes as single neutrons are removed from the nucleus.
