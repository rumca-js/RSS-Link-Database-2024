The movie begins streaming on Disney+ from November 17, 2023.\n\nEddie Garrick (Chris \u201cLudacris\u201d Bridges) is a good-hearted man who has turned his back on Christmas due to a traumatic childhood experience. At the request of his wife Allison Garrick (Teyonah Parris), from whom he is separated, Eddie takes his 8-year-old daughter Charlotte (Madison Skye Validum) out with him on Christmas Eve, where they meet a mysterious man in a red suit named Nick (Lil Rel Howery). Eddie, who is a social worker, thinks the man is delusional and needs professional help, but when he evokes the wrath of a local politician (Oscar Nu\u00f1ez), he and his daughter are taken on a magical adventure that just might restore his faith in Christmas. \n\nDashing through the Snow, which is directed by Tim Story and written by Scott Rosenb", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SaWJfa5qJw", "date_published": "2023-11-15T11:51:36+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "Ign - YouTube", "album": "Ign - YouTube", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/7SaWJfa5qJw/hqdefault.jpg", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "title": "The Game Awards Controversy: What even IS an indie game anymore? #indie #indiegame #gaming", "description": "", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtwALeZKaQw", "date_published": "2023-11-15T02:14:55+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "Ign - YouTube", "album": "Ign - YouTube", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/VtwALeZKaQw/hqdefault.jpg", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "title": "Baldur's Gate 3 Devs Tease Their Next Big Game - IGN Daily Fix", "description": "In today's Daily Fix:\nHot off the heels of their Game Awards nominations (including Best Game), Larian teases its next big game after Baldur\u2019s Gate 3.
