In fact, with echoes of Bob Boilen and Stephen Thompson's experience with Laura Gibson that gave birth to the Tiny Desk concert, I also wanted to hear Pereira da Costa's melodic fingerpicking prowess without the noisy crowd.\n\nAccompanied by second guitarist Jo\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 Pita Junior and percussionist Pedro Segundo, the trio bridges centuries of history with immaculate playing and plenty of smiles. As Pereira da Costa states in between songs, the entire performance is a musical journey through her homeland, from land to sea and everything in between.\n\nFado ", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzlZ68ts-IU", "date_published": "2023-11-15T13:31:55+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "NPR Music", "album": "NPR Music", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/wzlZ68ts-IU/hqdefault.jpg", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}]
