Here, we talk about how likely (or unlikely) that is, and why a lot of it will likely hinge on how the company handles GTA Online.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGBqT-4aUq4", "date_published": "2023-11-15T15:30:11+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "GamingBolt", "album": "GamingBolt", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/hGBqT-4aUq4/hqdefault.jpg", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "15 PS5 Single Player Games We NEED IN OUR LIVES", "description": "The games industry is in a really good place right now. There are plenty of heavy hitters releasing left, right, and center - and plenty of similarly highly anticipated games will be coming to your favorite platform in the near future. \n\nBut we can\u2019t just keep our minds from wondering about the many games that haven\u2019t been announced and maybe don\u2019t even have much of a chance of ever coming out - but we would love to see them make it to the PS5 sometime in the near future. \n\nSony has a vast breadth of abandoned first party third party franchises which we would love to see making a comeback in some shape or form.
