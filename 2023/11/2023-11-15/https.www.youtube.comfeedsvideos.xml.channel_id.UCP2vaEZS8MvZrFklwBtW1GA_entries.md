Mitered subway tile shower niche part 2
Using a grinder is the most cost-effective method for beveling tiles - in addition, the correct blade and polishing pad are invaluable. I hold the blade at a 45-degree angle and cut the back of the tile to within 1/16" of the finished edge. Then use an electroplated polishing pad to refine the bevel edge. Finally, when the tile is set, I remove any mortar from the bevel so that the miter can be tight (this frankly is one of the most important tips for anyone new to mitering tiles)
