  <p id="3lfBIm">Snapchat just launched a new AR makeup filter that links to products that users can buy to recreate their looks in the real world. It’s a partnership with cosmetics brand NYX Professional Makeup that they’re calling Beauty Bestie. </p>
<p id="DXH40J">AR beauty filters are nothing new, but Snapchat and NYX have turned this filter into a marketing tool for products consumers would typically find in a local pharmacy. With struggling pharmacy chains <a href="https:/

  <p id="0Gfy3R">Google announced a slew of updates to Maps, including improved transit directions, emoji reactions, and collaborative lists. </p>
<p id="Rm2Hed">With transit directions, Google Maps will now recommend different routes depending on what you want, with options such as “best route,” “fewer transfers,” “less walking,” “wheelchair accessible,” or “lowest cost.” The app will also clearly display station entrances and exits so you don’t accidentally get on the wrong train. </p>

  <p class="p--has-dropcap" id="ETVDyN">Nintendo may have <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21347074/nintendo-gigaleak-controversy-history-preservation-archives">a conflicted relationship with its history</a>, but if there’s one thing the company loves, it’s selling you classic games over and over again. I’ve honestly lost count of the number of platforms on which I own games like <em>Super Metroid</em> and <em>Super Mario Bros. 3</em>. That lack of attention from Nintendo is part of what makes <em>Super Mario RPG </em>such a curiosity — and its new remake on the Switch such a welcome sight.</p>

  <p id="TKnLQR">Today, Sharp is announcing the first Roku TV that features an OLED display. Until this point, the program — launched back in 2014 — has exclusively produced sets with LCD panels from a slew of different TV manufacturers. But with its new Aquos OLEDs, Sharp is finally bucking that trend. </p>
<p id="jnnNlK">Available in 55-inch and 65-inch sizes, these TVs support Dolby Vision IQ, HDR10, and feature four HDMI ports that all support variable refresh rate (VRR) for smooth 4K 120Hz gameplay. The Aquos OLED sets also include a 30-watt speaker system and full Dolby Atmos compatibility. </p>

<p id="OxPPv3">The heat pump replaced a radiator — those rattling, hissing things that are hallmarks of most old buildings in New York City. And if the heat pump proves itself this winter, it could one day make its way into virtually every room in every home in the city’s public housing system. And that could just be the start for

  <p id="9MBsYn">Microsoft is investigating Windows activation issues that appear to be linked to the company’s recent move to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/11/23913107/microsoft-windows-11-block-windows-7-8-keys-upgrade-activation">block Windows 7 and Windows 8 keys</a> from activating copies of Windows 10 and Windows 11. If you have an installation of Windows 10 / 11 that has been activated using the free upgrade from Windows 7 or 8, then there’s a chance it might become deactivated if you swap some hardware components or even upgrade your BIOS version.</p>
