<p>This twisty time-loop thriller gets even more dramatic in its second outing. Paapa Essiedu’s George is a jittery joy in a smart, sharply scripted show that’s lots of fun to watch</p><p>A lot can happen in 17 months. Keeping track of who is in the cabinet is difficult enough, let alone remembering the finer details of a TV series you watched in June 2022. When that show is the complex time-loop thriller The Lazarus Project, that’s even harder.</p><p>So, to recap: season one established that the Lazarus Project is an organisation capable of going back in time to a set point – the first day of July – to undo cataclysmic events. Our protagonist, George (Paapa Essiedu) joined the Project thanks to his innate ability to remember multiple timelines, only to find himself in an ethical quandary when his girlfriend Sarah was killed in a road accident. Not content to focus on the task at hand, namely preventing apocalyptic events, he instead engineered the detonation of a nuclear warhead to

Medevedev usually wins but Zverev loves playing in altitude. Could be close I think. They’ll both do their usual thing. Medvedev will stand miles back and not miss any balls, Zverev will serve big and try and take the court. He’s a crap volleyer though so he’s limited there. And also, Medvedev hates him – earlier this year, Zverev said they’d been friends since juniors, then Medvedev said I don’t know why he keeps saying that, we’ve known each other since then but never been friends. I’d still make Medvedev slight favourite but it’s very tight just because of the altitude.”</p><p><strong>Also for your delectation

Seated between Jacob Rees-Mogg and Scottish secretary Alister Jack, she would joke that all three came from estates but only hers was a council one. Yet privately, the girl who left school at 16 felt intimidated. “I was scared stiff to speak, so I did it in jokes,” she says, over tea at a Kensington hotel. “I did it with scouse humour and that was like my coat of armour.” In her new book The Plot, which claims to identify shadowy forces behind Boris Johnson’s downfall, Dorries writes that when a contact asks to meet at fancy London restaurant the Wolseley, she worries she won’t understand the menu. Seriously? “I’ve never been to many posh restaurants!” she cries. ‘I don’t socialise in London

But Anna Scher, who has died aged 78, had little patience with talk of fame. “We do not tolerate hubristic behaviour here,” she told her class in 1997. “Being an actor is just a job. Compared to being a midwife, it is really nothing and you should all remember that.”</p><p>Her students were asked to keep in mind five P words: punctuality, preparation, presentation, practice and positive.

Our limited and precious freshwater resources have become triggers, weapons and casualties of war and conflict.</p><p>Water is vital for everything we want to do: it allows us to grow food, run industries and businesses, cook and clean our homes, and manage our wastes. Although there is plenty of water on Earth, it is unevenly distributed in space and time, with humid and arid regions as well as wet and dry seasons.

<p>How one supporter revolutionised fan culture in women’s football in Sweden. Can it now spread to other countries?</p><p>Around 4pm on Saturday afternoon, the whistle blew on a dramatic final day of the 2023 Damallsvenskan season. At Nya Parken in Norrköping, thousands of exhilarated Hammarby fans surged on to the pitch. It was a moment of triumph, a scene of pure unbridled joy on the faces of the Stockholm club’s supporters as their team’s achievements sunk in. The 38-year wait for a second league title was finally over.</p><p>It was a victory that had never been guaranteed. Locked on points with fellow challengers BK Häcken, the destination of the trophy was, in the end, decided by a mere goal. Madelen Janogy’s brace on the day ensured that they kept their noses just in front, while holders Rosengård were left to settle for a spot in mid-table. It was a result that ensured that Pablo Piñones-Arce’s side completed the domestic double, having picked up the Swedish Cup back in June.

<p>The UK-based Vietnamese dancer and choreographer stages a piece inspired by the horror and dislocation of war with experimental vocals from Elaine Mitchener</p><p>Choreographer Dam Van Huynh was a child refugee from Vietnam and his latest work, Re:birth, draws directly on the experience of finding himself displaced in the aftermath of war. As is often the way in dance, a very specific inspiration can become a much more amorphous piece of choreography, leaving only traces and impressions, in this case an atmosphere of dislocation, oppression and anxiety, all under a headache of thick red light and rumbling soundtrack.</p><p>There are any number of ways that Van Huynh could generate these moods on stage, so the question becomes, why choose to do it this way? And also, why are they all in their pants?

<p>If Disney made Christian movies, they would look like this, with Mary in the mould of Beauty and the Beast’s Belle, Joseph giving Aladdin vibes and Banderas stealing every scene</p><p>If you feel the need to watch a faith film, you could do far, far worse than this one, a decently staged musical treatment of the nativity that feels like a Christian version of a live action Disney movie. Mary (Fiona Palomo) is a heroine in the mould of Belle from Beauty and the Beast or Jasmine from Aladdin: bookish and dreaming of a world in which she gets to make her own life decisions, instead of being married off to some guy called Joseph (Milo Manheim) whom she’s never met. Luckily, he turns out to be quite puckish and hunky (also in the Aladdin vein), while your comic relief type characters take the form of the Three Wise Men.</p><p>As in Disney, however, it’s the villain who is really memorable. Antonio Banderas can’t decide between stealing his scenes and chewing the scenery, so opts for bo

<p>A woman is mothered by an evolved smart home, in this lively speculative novel about consciousness and revolution</p><p>Lena, a human girl, has grown up alone in the jungle with her AI companion, Mother, also known as Jungle House. Mother is an evolved smart home, a surveillance system with a consciousness and an assertive, fretful voice. She has raised Lena alone and she can’t let Lena forget it. Lena is indigenous to the jungle, though it isn’t clear how and why she arrived at Jungle House as an infant. Now 20, she works as a caretaker for the Morel family, who use it as a holiday home. The Morels belong to the ruling elite. Mr Morel works in national security and his wife, a rubber-plantation heiress, is the model colonial lady – she paints watercolours, takes a gin and tonic at sunset, and is occasionally thoughtlessly brutal to her employees.</p><p>Jungle House is a speculative dystopian novel, set in a loose analogue to modern-day Colombia, where author Julianne Pachico grew

<p>Giant relics from previous centuries, a restoration effort and our writer’s childhood memories loom large on this hike along Britain’s first modern canal</p><p>I hadn’t planned my walk along the Sankey Canal to coincide with the axing of HS2 but it happened like that. It was a sunny day. I had been promising myself a hike along the towpath for ages. I grew up in the area and it holds a special place in my affections. As I wandered it struck me that this under-explored waterway was arguably the UK’s first significant development in infrastructure since the Romans built roads. It was built in two years.</p><p>The Sankey Canal connects St Helens with the River Mersey. It was opened in 1757 and subsequently extended to Widnes.

I rubbed my eyes as I scribbled equations on a notepad. It was long past midnight and the darkness beyond the small circle of light cast by my single lamp seemed immense.

<p>Discontent stirs in a village that has rejected modern life to follow a faith healer said to be the representative of the title’s water spirit</p><p>This visually beautiful and charismatically acted film is a fierce expressionist reverie or parable of power, shot in a lustrous, high-contrast black-and-white by cinematographer Lílis Soares. It is the work of Nigerian director CJ “Fiery” Obasi, whose nickname makes an interesting elemental contrast to his movie’s watery theme. His storytelling urgency and stripped-down minimalism reminded me at various stages of George Orwell and Julie Dash.</p><p>We are in a west African village called Iyi, which has ignored the modern world of science and technology in favour of worshipping the traditional water spirit Mami Wata, through her intermediary and representative on Earth, faith-healer Mama Efe (Rita Edochie), to whom tributes of food and money must be paid.
