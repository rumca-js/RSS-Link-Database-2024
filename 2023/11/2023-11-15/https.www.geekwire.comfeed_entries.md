On the floor below, an assistive dexterous arm picked up pieces of fruit as part of a robot-assisted feeding system. Others demoed their research on the implications of facial recognition technology and security of government websites. The annual Research Showcase and Open House at the UW&#8217;s Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science &#38; Engineering offered a glimpse at the current state and potential direction of computing — demonstrating the growing impact&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/uw-computer-science-research-event-offers-a-glimpse-of-the-future-at-the-dawn-of-ai/">Read More</a>

Mayor Bruce Harrell, who has sought to get the city to test gunshot detection tech for years, allocated $1.8 million in his 2024 budget proposal for a &#8220;crime prevention pilot&#8221; that would include use of acoustic gunshot locator systems. Seattle councilmembers voted 5-4 Tuesday to deny an amendment that would have allocated the funding to homelessness services instead of the gunshot detection system. The technology works via the installation of acoustic sensors&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/seattle-mayor-may-finally-get-city-to-test-gunshot-detection-tech/">Read More</a>

The company says the chips represent &#8220;a last puzzle piece&#8221; in its Azure infrastructure, giving it a direct role in designing every layer of the cloud platform responsible for an increasingly significant portion of its business. One of the Microsoft-designed chips, the Azure Maia AI Accelerator, is optimized for AI tasks, including generative artificial intelligence. The other, Azure Cobalt CPU, is an Arm-based processor intended for general-purpose cloud workloads.&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/microsoft-unveils-custom-ai-chip-with-help-from-openai-playing-catch-up-with-ama

The launch of Astro for Business, announced Wednesday, makes the Amazon robot widely available for the first time. It can work autonomously, via preprogrammed routes and routines, or manually via the Amazon Astro app. The business version starts at $2,349.99, with different subscription options that total as much as $179/month. Astro was launched for home users on an invite-only basis in 2021, currently selling for $1,599.99 under the Amazon&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/amazons-astro-robot-gets-its-first-job-going-to-work-as-a-security-guard/">Read More</a>

The approach has two climate benefits, said CEO and co-founder Todd Brix. First, it uses CO2 that&#8217;s captured as an industrial waste from facilities such as biogas and bioenthanol producers or it&#8217;s pulled from the atmosphere using a direct air capture device. Second, it generates formic acid and other formate chemicals that can replace fossil fuels as a feedstock for fuels and other products.

And although it&#8217;ll be a while before those programs begin in earnest, Orbite CEO Jason Andrews says the first 500 people to make a refundable deposit will be in for some astronaut-worthy experiences between now and then. &#8220;What we are announcing today is just the beginning,&#8221; he said. Orbite plans to invite early-stage customers in its Founders Club to attend a series of space-adjacent events, starting with&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/orbite-countdown-astronaut-training-programs/">Read More</a>

Seattle-based Canopy revealed a $4 million seed round and its gameplan to help companies get a better grip on their data integrations. Founded last year, Canopy describes itself as a &#8220;data composability platform&#8221; that aims to give developers an easier and more efficient way to integrate and manage data with front-end applications, replacing clunky custom code with its software. Canopy is initially focused on e-commerce companies but says its technology can be used in various verticals.&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/seattle-data-infrastructure-startup-led-by-fabric-co-founder-emerges-from-stealth-wit

Online video games produce astonishing amounts of information, even if those games are relatively simple, i.e. a World of Warcraft. Games-as-a-service, especially titles like Rec Room that involve large amounts of user-generated content, can create so much data that it’s becoming increasingly important for studios to be able to efficiently store, search, and process that data.
