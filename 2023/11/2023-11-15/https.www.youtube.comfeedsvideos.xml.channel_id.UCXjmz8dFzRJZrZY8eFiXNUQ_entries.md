It's no secret that the Anti-Hero is not a new character type.  Though for a brief period it seemed most major networks were attempting to create stories around Anti-Heroes specifically.  From The Wire, The Sopranos, and Deadwood, to Breaking Bad and Mad Men, these Anti-Hero characters dominated the small screen for almost a decade.  But in today's television landscape, it seems the Ani-Hero has been almost forgotten about.
