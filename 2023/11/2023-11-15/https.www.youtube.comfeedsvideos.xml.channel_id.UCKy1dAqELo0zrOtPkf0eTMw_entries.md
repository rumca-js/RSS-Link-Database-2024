The Last Faith reviewed on PC by Jarrett Green. Also available on Xbox and PlayStation.

If you’ve already played genre leaders like Blasphemous 2 or Bloodstained, then I see no problem spending some time in the dark and largely derivative world of The Last Faith. I don’t think you’ll leave its samey dungeons or lackluster boss fights with a new favorite action game on your list, but navigating the maze of different areas and busting their big ugly masters is challenging and satisfying. The smattering of spells look fun and the collection weapons are genuinely cool with special abilities that are a blast to let loose, I just wish this game gave you more space to experiment without having to trade combat effectiveness. All that said, The Last Faith is not the pinnacle of what this sort of game has to offer by any stretch, and there are plenty of amazing ones I’d recommend that you play before crossing this one off of your list.

Loki: Season 2 ended with a true bang, as Tom Hiddleston’s god of mischief made the ultimate sacrifice and proved himself every bit the hero his big brother Thor is. Before this episode, Loki already rivaled Josh Brolin’s Thanos as the best villain in the MCU. Now, he may just be the best character in the MCU, full stop. No other MCU character has come so far or been so fundamentally transformed over the course of so many movies and TV episodes.

As the dust of that epic finale settles, let’s take a look at how Loki: Season 2 brought the character full circle and delivered a fitting end to Loki Laufeyson’s story. And while we’re at it, is there still room for a Season 3?

Loki stars Tom Hiddleston, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Wunmi Mosaku, Eugene Cordero, Tara Strong, Owen Wilson, Sophia Di Martino, Jonathan Majors and Neil Ellice. Season 2 is now streaming on Disney+.

Super Mario RPG reviewed by Tom Marks on Nintendo Switch.

This wonderfully faithful remake makes it easy for anyone who missed it in the SNES era to see why it's considered a classic. It’s unabashedly odd, and it’s also ultra-satisfying to time your attacks just right. Super Mario RPG already held up pretty well if you didn’t mind a bit of dust on its different systems, but now there’s no excuse not to see why Mario’s most unexpected adventure is still so beloved.
