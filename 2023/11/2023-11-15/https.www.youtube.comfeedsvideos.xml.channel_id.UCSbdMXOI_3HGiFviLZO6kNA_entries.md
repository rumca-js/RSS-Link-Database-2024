Hello and welcome to TUESDAY NEWSDAY! Your number one resource for the entire weeks worth of VR news! A brand new super high end VR headset has just been teased, butt haptics with rats in the matrix? And Meta and the Quest are about to make, probably the biggest move it’s made yet in the VR space and it’s actually a pretty big deal.
I'll also talk about a really huge project I’ve been working on and what I’ve been doing these past few weeks.

Thank you to SideQuest for sponsoring this video! They're doing a Quest 3 giveaway EVERY week on Banter until Xmas, here's the link!
