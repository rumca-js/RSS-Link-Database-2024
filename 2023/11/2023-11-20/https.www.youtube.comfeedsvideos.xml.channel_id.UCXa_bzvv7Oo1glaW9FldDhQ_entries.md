Free Range Games' The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria offers an intriguing premise focused on one of the series' most iconic locations, wrapping it in a survival sandbox hack-and-slash structure akin to titles like Valheim. The set-up is strong, and the atmosphere, especially as your Dwarf ventures deep into Moria's caverns, feels epic.

However, that aura of fantasy mystery is interrupted by shallow combat, iffy mechanics, restrictions on where you can mine, and some awkward building mechanics. The action just can't live up to the lore, and trying to build within the game's stingy rules can be annoying.

The distinct lack of polish and limited animations also don't help matters. It's a shame because, with better gameplay, Return to Moria could have been something special. For now, it has to settle for being comfortably mediocre.

The release of Grand Theft Auto VI’s reveal trailer is sure to be a global cultural event. Rockstar are held to a higher ideal than most developers, and for good reason given the astronomical budget at their disposal. 

Fans expect a vibrant, lifelike game world, culturally influencing story and themes, all whilst harnessing the cutting-edge technology the soon-to-be twenty-five-year strong developer is known for. 

It’s fair to say their games change the world, in some shape or form. So, prior to the release of Grand Theft Auto VI’s trailer, anticipation is at fever pitch. Hype is burgeoning. There’s a lot of pressure on Rockstar to deliver a trailer that’ll appease its legions of fans, but given their shifted workplace culture in recent years are they up to the task?

The rumors, sparse as they are, were true: The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered is real. Launching on January 19th, 2024, for PS5, it features two graphics modes – Fidelity Mode for native 4K and Performance Mode with upscaled 1440p to 4K. It will include DualSense support, improved visual details, and the Lost Levels, early development slices that didn't make it in the final game.

If that wasn't enough, developer commentary is also included, along with new outfits, Speedrun Mode, additional accessibility features and more. You can even enter a guitar free play mode to spend some time mastering the craft (in-game, of course).
