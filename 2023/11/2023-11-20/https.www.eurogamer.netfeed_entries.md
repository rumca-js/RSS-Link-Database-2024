If you have been on the lookout for a new seasonal knitting project but are yet to be inspired, well, Remedy may just have exactly what you need. 
</p><p>
The Alan Wake 2 developer has just shared the knitting pattern for Saga Anderson's rather fetching Nordic-inspired jumper (which was made by her mother, you know).
</p><p>
The cosy jumper features a festive pattern, which includes a deer and tree motif. It is ideal for this time of year, when the nights are longer and - where I live, at least - quite a lot colder.

Two ex-Niantic employees are taking the Pok&eacute;mon Go maker to court over claims of sexual bias in the workplace.
</p><p>
The lawsuit is set to be contested in Los Angeles tomorrow by Niantic, which is seeking to dismiss the case and move the matter into arbitration - something the company claims its former employees previously agreed to.
</p><p>
The legal dispute originally <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/7/23787809/niantic-lawsuit-systemic-sexual-bias-pay-disparity">began in July</a>, when a Niantic staff member left jobless by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-developer-niantic-laying-off-hundreds-of-staff">this summer's job cull at the company</a> alleged that it had been a "boys club" and that she had been paid less than a male colleague despite being in a more senior job role.

Harry Krueger, the director of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/returnal-review-magnificent-and-monstrous">2021's PlayStation 5 exclusive Returnal</a>, is leaving Housemarque after almost 15 years at the studio.
</p><p>
Krueger said the decision to move on was a "very difficult" one, but he was confident Housemarque's "brightest chapter" is still ahead. 
</p><p>
"During my 14 years at Housemarque, I've been incredibly fortunate to work on one dream project after another, and had the privilege of working alongside some truly talented and wonderful people along the way," Kruger wrote in a statement announcing his depature on the <a href="https://housemarque.com/news/2023/11/16/harry-krueger-to-depart-from-housemarque-after-almost-15-remarkable-years">company's website</a>.

## DF Weekly: PlayStation Portal's quality is reliant on your home network set-up

Since then, the device has already sold out and in my experience, it's already commanding anything up to a &pound;150 price premium. Well, it's a bit of a stretch to justify its &pound;199 sticker price and I wouldn't recommend paying a penny more. When it works, it's fine, but I can't help but think that a first-party device from a console manufacturer should not ship in a state where the core quality of the device is entirely reliant on third-party equipment it has no oversight over.</p><p>That's the key thing about console gaming, in my opinion. Every device is the same, so by extension, the gameplay experience should be quantifiably and qualitatively ident

If you are on the Premium tier of Sony's PlayStation Plus subscription service, you can now have a go at both The Lord of the Rings: Gollum and Baldur's Gate 3, as part of the subscription's trial offerings.
</p><p>
Users will be able to play up to an hour of The Lord of the Rings: Gollum. 
</p><p>
Baldur's Gate 3's trial, meanwhile, offers a more generous two hours of play time (although, given how vast the game actually is, this is really just a smidgen of the full release).

## Insomniac's Wolverine reportedly due 2025, darker than Spider-Man

Insomniac Games' take on Wolverine is reportedly set to release in 2025 as a PlayStation 5 exclusive. 
</p><p>
That's according to internet tipster <a href="https://twitter.com/DanielRPK/status/1726265405847597321">DanielRPK</a> , who is perhaps best known for their scoops on Marvel TV shows and movies.
</p><p>
DanielRPK said the upcoming Wolverine game will be, perhaps unsurprisingly, a much darker and more violent game than the studio's Spider-Man titles. Additionally, the tipster has said it will feature Madripoor, Marvel's fictional island often associated with X-Men stories (which popped up in the MCU relatively recently in the Falcon and the Winter Soldier TV series).
