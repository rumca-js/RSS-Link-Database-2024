It is well documented by now that capitalism has brought more people out of poverty and into freedom than any other system in <a href="https://nationalpost.com/news/world/the-capitalist-manifesto-hate-capitalism-too-bad-it-keeps-lifting-millions-out-of-poverty" target="_blank">history</a>.</p><p>In fact, economic freedom is essential for economic growth. This is why more regulations from the government typically lead to stagnation, to say the least. </p><p>This is why it is no surprise that New York has once again been <a href="https://nypost.com/2023/11/19/metro/ny-ranked-least-free-state-with-high-taxes-debt-regulation-study/?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=nypost" target="_blank">lab

Only it predated that match with Charna Lee Diamond and Ronnie Dunster. The big gag was that even though Charna was plucky and wouldn't back down, the massive size and strength difference between (someone who was born) male and (someone who was born) female was too much to overcome.</p><p>So much so, the man hit the ball THROUGH the woman.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
