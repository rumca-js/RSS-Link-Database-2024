<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Guys, i upgraded my printer and have no need for a 2nd one. I would like to find someone that needs a first printer. I’m offering an Ender3 v2 Neo in working conditions with some upgrades. It requires a bit of love - i think the either the extruder or the printer hotend needs some cleaning and/or tuning (the hotend is new and has 3 hours on it - it should be fine). I have some extra parts/nozzles/tools that will go with it.</p> <p>I’m not looking for money, but would appreciate it if you only ask for it if you don’t already have a printer and/or your printer died and you can’t afford a new one right now. Please don’t take it just to have one more printer. <strong>Must pick up in Miami Beach today or tomorrow AM.</strong></p> <p>In general it’s well tuned - proper offsets, bltouch, etc. It’s running a custom MRsicoc firmware that has input shaping enabled, but i never configured/set it up.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="htt
