The obsession with "barely legal" content might seem new, but historically, the media and entertainment spheres have put a lot of emphasis on celebrities and their ascension to "adulthood". While today's young people can more or less do this themselves with the advent of adult content websites, in the past, teenage actresses in particular were subjected to gross behaviour from those who should have known better.

I wanted to explore this topic because, in a world there "barely legal" content is more or less normalized, it raises a tonne of questions about those around us, and whether or not our social standards need to be examined and FIXED.
