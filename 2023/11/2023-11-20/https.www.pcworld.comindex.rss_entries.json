Not in 2023. Fresh new gear flew fast and furious this year, causing an avalanche of releases seemingly every time you blinked. PCWorld&rsquo;s staff reviewed more PC hardware and software in 2023 than we have anytime in recent memory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With such a gluttony of choice, it became harder than ever for PC hardware and software to impress us. Few products earned our rare Editors&rsquo; Choice award. And only the very best of the best grace this list.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Without further ado, this is the Best PC Hardware and Software of 2023, as chosen by PCWorld&rsquo;s editors.
