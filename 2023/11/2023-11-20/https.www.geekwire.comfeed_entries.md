A jury in Delaware reached a unanimous verdict on Friday awarding more than $31 million in damages for 10x Genomics, a Pleasanton, Calif. company that accused NanoString of infringing on seven patents related to NanoString&#8217;s GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiler that analyzes RNA and protein. NanoString said it plans to overturn or amend the verdict, and file an appeal. It plans to continue selling its GeoMX products. &#8220;We remain resolute in our&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/nanostring-stock-sinks-nearly-50-after-losing-patent-lawsuit-case-against-10x-genomics/">Read More</a>

With Satya Nadella&#8217;s announcement late Sunday that ousted OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Chairman Greg Brockman will be joining Microsoft, the Redmond company has seemingly squeezed a sweet outcome from what initially appeared to be some exceedingly sour circumstances for its ambitions in artificial intelligence. The company is &#8220;extremely excited to share the news that Sam Altman and Greg Brockman, together with colleagues, will be joining Microsoft to lead a new advanced AI&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/microsoft-emerges-victorious-from-openai-meltdown-with-sam-altman-leading-its-new-ai-research-lab/">Read More</a>

The Information and Bloomberg both reported late Sunday that the OpenAI board tapped Shear as CEO. OpenAI shocked the tech industry Friday when its board announced that Altman was out as CEO of the company he helped start in 2015. The decision blindsided even Microsoft, a key OpenAI partner that has invested billions into the company. Reports over the weekend indicated that Altman and&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/openai-reportedly-taps-twitch-co-founder-emmett-shear-as-interim-ceo/">Read More</a>
