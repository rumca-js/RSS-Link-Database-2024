Environmental scientists Juliane Klaura, Laura Scherer, and Gerard Breeman were the first to calculate this number on a global scale. "Reducing these numbers would not only prevent unnecessary animal suffering but also contribute to the fight against climate change."

Incidences of cyberstalking have risen, with the U.S. Department of Justice estimating that more than 1.3 million people experience this type of victimization annually. A new study has explored research to identify the factors associated with perpetration and victimization in cyberstalking. The study's findings can inform the development of efforts to prevent and address cyberstalking.

The commercial importance of lithium is ever-growing, and its production is globally dominated by lithium-cesium-tantalum (LCT) pegmatites. These are spectacular rocks featuring impressive ultra-coarse textures, but they are very elusive due to a combination of factors: they are small, and until a decade ago, they were often regarded as nothing more than a geological curiosity. As a result, our knowledge of LCT pegmatites from an exploration standpoint is limited, which makes them hard to find.

Our view of the cosmos is always limited by the fact we are located within a galaxy filled with interstellar gas and dust. This is most dramatically seen in the central region of the Milky Way, which is filled with so much dust that it is sometimes referred to as the Zone of Avoidance. Within this zone, our observations of extragalactic objects are limited, but that is starting to change.

As well as demonstrators looking to join the protest, around 2,000 far-right activists and football hooligans descended on London, too. Their goal, as members of the UK far right put it, was to "defend"" the Cenotaph from the pro-Palestine marchers.

Signals from the environment set off a cascade of changes that affect different genes in different ways. Therefore, traditionally, it has been difficult to study how such signals influence an organism. In a new study, researchers have developed a machine-learning approach called FUN-PROSE to predict how genes react to different environmental conditions.
