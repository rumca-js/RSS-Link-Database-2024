In the era of rapidly developing e-commerce, China's online platforms have designed and created the largest online shopping festival: November 11, known as Double11. It’s a once-a-year opportunity to stimulate consumption and the desire to spend. It’s also known as Singles Day because its numerical form looks like four bare branches (11.11), a Chinese expression for single and unattached. E-commerce giants, including Alibaba Group and Jingdong, expect this day to be a "carnival" for consumers as merchants cut prices. At its peak, Alibaba Group offered 24-hour discounts and free nationwide shipping. 
This strategy has succeeded over the last 14 years. But this year, it didn't work.
