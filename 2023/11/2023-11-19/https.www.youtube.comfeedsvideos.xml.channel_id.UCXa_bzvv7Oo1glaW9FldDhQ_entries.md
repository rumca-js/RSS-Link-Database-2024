The Xbox Series X has proven itself as a more than capable machine when it comes to handling computationally taxing video games. The console features a 12 TFLOP GPU that’s marginally higher than its direct competition. Between this and support for hardware-accelerated ray tracing, the Xbox Series X can render some incredibly demanding scenes without compromising on the resolution or framerate. 

There are plenty of incredible games (both of the first-party and third-party ilk) that make good use of this power and bring to life some amazing vistas that are not too different from real life. With this feature, we will be looking at 15 of the best games that serve as a great showcase for the power of Xbox Series X.

With its Spider-Man series, Insomniac Games has proven that it’s more than capable of handling a major license in the best way possible, so it’s not surprising that there’s as much excitement surrounding the upcoming Marvel’s Wolverine as there is. 

But though expectations are high that the developer will be able to capture the essence of Wolverine as well as it did with Spider-Man, the two are obviously very, very different properties in more ways than one. 

So, if we can’t expect Marvel’s Wolverine to be too similar in its gameplay and design to the Spider-Man series, where else could it look for inspiration? Funnily enough, fellow PlayStation franchise might actually serve as the perfect template- here, we look at why.
