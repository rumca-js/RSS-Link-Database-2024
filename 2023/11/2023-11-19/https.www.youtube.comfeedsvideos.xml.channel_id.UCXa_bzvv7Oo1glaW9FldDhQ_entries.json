The console features a 12 TFLOP GPU that\u2019s marginally higher than its direct competition. Between this and support for hardware-accelerated ray tracing, the Xbox Series X can render some incredibly demanding scenes without compromising on the resolution or framerate. \n\nThere are plenty of incredible games (both of the first-party and third-party ilk) that make good use of this power and bring to life some amazing vistas that are not too different from real life. With this feature, we will be looking at 15 of the best games that serve as a great showcase for the power of Xbox Series X.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fRaHTqMHhw", "date_published": "2023-11-19T15:30:00+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "GamingBolt", "album": "GamingBolt", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/1fRaHTqMHhw/hqdefault.jpg", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "MARVEL'S WOLVERINE PS5 NEEDS TO DO THIS...", "description": "With its Spider-Man series, Insomniac Games has proven that it\u2019s more than capable of handling a major license in the best way possible, so it\u2019s not surprising that there\u2019s as much excitement surrounding the upcoming Marvel\u2019s Wolverine as there is. \n\nBut though expectations are high that the developer will be able to capture the essence of Wolverine as well as it did with Spider-Man, the two are obviously very, very different properties in more ways than one. \n\nSo, if we can\u2019t expect Marvel\u2019s Wolverine to be too similar in its gameplay and design to the Spider-Man series, where else could it look for inspiration? Funnily enough, fellow PlayStation franchise might actually serve as the perfect template- here, we look at why.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8wwI3av6I0", "date_published": "2023-11-19T13:30:07+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "GamingBolt", "album": "GamingBolt", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/P8wwI3av6I0/hqdefault.jpg", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}]
