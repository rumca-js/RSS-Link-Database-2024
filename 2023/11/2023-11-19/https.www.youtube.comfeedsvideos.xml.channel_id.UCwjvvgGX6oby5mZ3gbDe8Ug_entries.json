It\u2019s a once-a-year opportunity to stimulate consumption and the desire to spend. It\u2019s also known as Singles Day because its numerical form looks like four bare branches (11.11), a Chinese expression for single and unattached. E-commerce giants, including Alibaba Group and Jingdong, expect this day to be a \"carnival\" for consumers as merchants cut prices. At its peak, Alibaba Group offered 24-hour discounts and free nationwide shipping. \nThis strategy has succeeded over the last 14 years. But this year, it didn't work.\n\nHave questions?
