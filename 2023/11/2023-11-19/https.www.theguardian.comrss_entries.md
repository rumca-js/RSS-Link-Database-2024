<p>Many will remember Ackland best on the big screen as plummy defenders of the realm, but this supremely polished star could also handle action, comedy – and a lot of cold war Soviets</p><p>Joss Ackland’s elegant bearing, natural aplomb and English theatrical training meant that he never lacked for work on stage or screen, largely playing authority and establishment figures — although these movie roles were a bit ironised and sent up in the parts he got offered in the 90s and 00s (to his reported chagrin).</p><p>But growing up, I was aware of him only via that rich, mellifluous voice of his, like melted butterscotch, in an inordinate number of TV ads: his tones were received pronunciation with a dash of naughtiness and insinuation, that of a TV newsreader or bishop who loved to savour a fine wine, or a decent cigar.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/nov/19/from-white-mischief-to-bill-ted-joss-ackland-was-an-actor-of-rare-class-range-and-pathos">Continue reading...</

<p>Recent displays against Australia and Malta show Gareth Southgate’s side are vulnerable without the Arsenal midfielder</p><p>It comes back to balance.

<p>Scotland seemed a bit unsure how to handle this uncharted territory. Decades of international failure took a toll. A place at Euro 2024 was sealed with two qualifying matches to spare, meaning this visit of Norway always promised to be notable mainly for celebration of the achievements of Steve Clarke and his team. Yet against this backdrop, Scotland were without a win in four games. Clarke would always demand the stopping of the rot, regardless of broader success.</p><p>Scotland’s players and staff took to their post-match lap of honour having failed to end their semi-troubling run. The sharing of six goals on a highly entertaining evening at Hampden Park tells the story of teams who were playing without shackles. Norway were perfectly value for at least a point. Clarke and Scotland can shrug that the important work was carried out much earlier.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/nov/19/mohamed-elyounoussi-rescues-draw-for-norway-in-thriller-against-scotland">

With more than 130 film and TV roles to his credit, he was constantly in work. And even if he was rarely the star – a notable exception was his performance as CS Lewis in the original 1985 TV version of Shadowlands – he was always a reassuring presence. Ackland had a gift for quiet understatement, and for exuding power and authority; those seemingly contradictory talents were visible in a quartet of superb stage performances for which I shall always remember him.</p><p>One of the hardest things for an actor to convey is a modest goodness, and Ackland did it consu

Off the pitch, though, not all is sweetness and light with the Chiefs confirming their squad were paid late last month and annual losses of around £4m for the last tax year expected to be announced within the next 10 days.</p><p>Exeter officials remain adamant that a slight delay in paying their players’ wages was a “simple clerical error” and strenuously refute the idea the club is in danger of going out of business. The Guardian has been told that a staff member processing the wages unwittingly tried to pay them via the wrong bank account, leading to the players being paid 10 hours late on the 31<sup>st</sup> October.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/nov/19/henry-slade-exete

Once an occasional irritation, it recently spent a couple of years as a key symptom of a disease that everyone was worried about, and it has never entirely recovered.

But, Covid aside, what else might be causing that cough? And is there anything, realistically, you can do about it?</p><p>“Coughs are a commonly presenting complaint, but in the vast majority of cases they’re nothing to worry about,” says Dr Timothy Gatheral, a consultant respiratory physician at the University of Lancaster. “As a consultant, I have a different perspective, as most cases I see have advanced to someth

<p>A 12-year-old girl is obliged to care for her younger siblings in a powerful novel about rural destitution on the edge of Europe</p><p>Liliana Corobca’s <em>Kinderland</em> is the story of three children in contemporary Moldova whose parents have gone abroad to work. The novel opens with the middle child, Dan, crying because there’s a tick on his stomach. His sister, Cristina, who narrates the book, doesn’t know how to remove it and so she goes out into the street, asking for help. We at once get a sense of the precariousness of their existence, the dangers that surround them. Cristina is 12 when <em>Kinderland</em> begins, Dan is six and Marcel a toddler. Cristina looks after not just her brothers, but also the pig, dog, cat and chickens that the family depend upon.</p><p>The book is structured without chapters, nor with any strong sense of narrative progression; rather, it works by accretion, taking us into the small moments of sublimity and loss that make up Cristina’s life.

Cauliflowers and aubergines get top billing for delicious nourishing meals this autumn<p>Given the time, I am happy to cook my aubergines over an open flame, holding the purple-black beauties one by one over the gas flame with kitchen tongs, turning them slowly until their skin has charred. It is the sort of kitchen task over which you can daydream as the aubergine flesh softens. If I haven’t set the fire alarms off, I will end up with an aubergine whose soul has taken on the deep, smoky notes that give the characteristic flavour to moutabal, the luscious cream that consists of nothing but charred aubergine and olive oil, though many will season it further with a little lemon and garlic.</p><p>On most occasions I forgo the grilling and bake my aubergines instead. A compromise, but one that works. I set the oven to high and ensure the skins are blackened before splitting and scooping out the silky flesh with a spoon. A deeply pleasing task. I then mash it with a fork, slowly introduci

Investment, investment, investment must be the chancellor’s mantra.

A focus on growth in their eyes can have only one meaning: buying back popularity with tax cuts.</p><p>It is breathtakingly wrong. Tax cuts, especially the widely mooted deep cuts to inheritance tax that Hunt is said to be considering, will do little for growth – instead choking off a much-needed source of revenue and inflating inequality.

The former prime minister’s return to government will be a constant reminder to voters of how long the Tories have been in power<p>It can’t have been for the peerage, because former prime ministers can usually get a berth on the claret-coloured benches of the Lords for the asking. It can’t have been for the salary, because his piggy bank is well-stuffed after spending his post-Downing Street life truffling for gold.

<p>A new book on the club’s glory years illustrates how football has become poorer as it has become vastly wealthy</p><p>I finished <em>Watford Forever,</em> John Preston’s excellent new book about the friendship between Elton John and Graham Taylor and the effect it had on the town of Watford and the football club at its heart, feeling an unexpectedly profound sense of loss. The loss of a man I hardly knew, the joyful, fragile biosphere he created and a game I hardly recognise.</p><p>Two days after Taylor died in 2017, I took my son, who was seven at the time, to see Watford play Middlesbrough at Vicarage Road. I remember little of the game itself, which was overshadowed by the minute’s applause held in tribute to Taylor. As the crowd stood I looked around me and saw many hundreds of people of approximately my age, who would have been small children during Taylor’s first spell at the club, many of them with children of their own.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/202

<p>The ​impressive c​ombat sequences pull you right in, but ​both the director and Joaquin Phoenix​ as Bonaparte struggle to show us what drove ​the military mastermind</p><p>“Napoleonic battles are so beautiful. Like vast, lethal ballets… they all have an aesthetic brilliance that doesn’t require a military mind to appreciate.” So said Stanley Kubrick, who had long cherished the ambition of directing a film exploring the life of the Corsican-born artillery officer who rose to become the emperor of France. And Kubrick came close to doing so in the late 1960s, before being forced to abandon the project. This appreciation of the savage artistry of the great general’s battle strategies is a sentiment that you suspect was shared by Ridley Scott in his approach to <em>Napoleon</em>, a sturdy but uneven historical epic that traces the rise and fall of Bonaparte (Joaquin Phoenix), starting with the French Revolution and a not quite historically accurate depiction of the execution of Marie A

Over the following years she spent extended periods in remote Romanian villages, taking pictures. A translator she was working with had mentioned to her a particular local folktale called Youth Without Age and Life Without Death; the story, about a prince who goes in search of a land where time stands still, gave her the idea for a book of photographs.</p><p>In that book, published this month, Pannack has created strange and haunting pictures with some of the villagers she met and lived among to illustrate ideas from that story.

<p>Barbra Streisand’s eloquent and commanding memoir reveals her insecurities along with a hunger for fame and complete control</p><p>A voice like Barbra Streisand’s is a mystery, even to its owner: two bits of gristle in the throat resonantly swell in her head and chest to produce a storm of sound that Streisand first heard when vocalising in the stairwell of a Brooklyn tenement. Taken to a recording studio by her mother at the age of 14, she gratuitously riffed on a melody and, as she recalls, “something came out of my mouth that completely surprised me”. A decade later in <em>Funny Girl</em>, that finely tuned and amped-up “something” stunned the world. At the prow of a tug boat in New York harbour, triumphantly brandishing a bouquet to upstage the Statue of Liberty’s torch, Streisand turns the sky into an echo chamber as she orders the overcast weather not to rain on her parade.</p><p>Her autobiography matches the commanding noise she makes.

This northern temple to everything fishy hits all the right notes<p><strong><a href="https://colmansseafoodtemple.co.uk/">Colmans Seafood Temple</a>, Sea Road, South Shields NE33 2LD (0191 511 1349</strong><strong>). Starters £9.50-£15.95, mains £13.95-£46, desserts £4.95-£6.95, wines from £21.95</strong></p><p>Calling your restaurant a temple to anything is a bold move, but the Colman family in South Shields has an excuse, and it’s not the menu. The menu is great. It’s all the things you want from a restaurant like this looking out over the foaming waves, plus a few things you didn’t know you needed. The excuse is the building. Colmans Seafood Temple, which opened in 2017, is built out of a colonnaded bandstand first constructed in 1931. It quickly became known as Gandhi’s Temple although, according to local history, no one is quite sure why. There is no evidence of Mahatma Gandhi either worshipping or being worshipped here. There were, and still are, public lavatories in its base.

Less is definitely more when it comes to a little colour to lift your cheeks<p>A few weeks back, I spotted a woman on the train with flaming cheeks. My heart went out to her as I thought she was battling rosacea, which is frustratingly tricky to control. On closer inspection, I realised she was simply wearing far too much powder blusher. So here’s an easier in: get a cream blush. Place a few teeny dots around your cheeks, smile, lightly rub in a circular motion and, voilà, a blush that doesn’t make you look as if you are dealing with a skin condition.</p><p><strong>1.

Rich, robust and sometimes even a little edgy, the red wines of Italy always make a statement – but they’re are best enjoyed alongside a great dinner, too<p><strong>Asda Extra Special Rosso di Montalcino, Italy 2018 (£18, <a href="https://www.asda.com/">Asda</a>) </strong>Italian red wines can be a bit of an acquired taste. They’re not always smooth, soft, or evidently fruity (although they can be). They tend, rather, to be a little edgy, with many of the country’s remarkable palette of indigenous grape varieties naturally providing a mix of elevated, mouth-watering (and sometimes eyewatering) acidity and – when compared to the frictionless texture of, say, a supermarket Chilean merlot or Argentine malbec – a perceptible feeling of dry chewiness from plentiful tannin. That means that, with one or two exceptions, they’re not the kind of thing you would crack open to sip on their own on the sofa of an evening. These are wines that are intended for food, and it’s amazing how a mouthful
