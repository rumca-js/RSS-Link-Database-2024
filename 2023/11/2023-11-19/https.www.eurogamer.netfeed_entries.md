</p><p>By spamming weapon attacks, ItsJinosaur has been able to fully customise the bathhouse/spa, arguably one of Stardew's most overlooked, and under-used, landmarks.
</p><p>"The Bathhouse looked a little decrepit, so I decided to touch things up and made everything look better," ItsJinosuar explained on the game's subreddit page.

</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wonder-woman-job-listing-suggests-itll-be-a-live-service-game">A recent job listing for Warner Bros. and developer Monolith Productions' upcoming Wonder Woman game</a> sought a 'Lead Software Engineer, Gameplay', with "live software product or game" experience listed as a "nice to have". 
</p><p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, then, this led some to speculate that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wonder-woman-job-listing-suggests-itll-be-a-live-service-game">Warner Bros. might have been looking to incorporate live service elements</a> in the upcoming title.

## Steam Deck OLED doesn't just look better than LCD, it plays better too

With its remarkable OLED HDR display, dramatically improved battery life and numerous quality of life fixes, the new Steam Deck OLED is an exceptional PC handheld - but there was something else I noticed during testing that I wanted to check out. The system felt snappier and more responsive - and it is. Backers of the DF Supporter Program were also expecting response time improvements from the new screen which further motivated my testing and yes, it turns out that Steam Deck OLED doesn't just last longer and look better, depending on your sensitivity to input lag, it <em>plays better</em> too.</p><p>
At a basic level you can define input lag as the time taken between user input - like pressing a button - then the resulting action happening on-screen. There's always going to be processing time within the game engine itself, which is the

## 25 years on, Space Station Silicon Valley remains an innovative gem

It may come as a surprise, given how accustomed we are to games weighing in at hundreds of gigabytes, that the entire Nintendo 64 library comes to less than 25GB. Including Japanese exclusives, that's 388 games - 7530 fewer than released on the PlayStation. It's odd, then, in such a relatively small selection, how much room there is for games to fall through the cracks and slip out of our collective consciousness.
</p><p>
One can justifiably blame this on the titanic status of many Nintendo 64 titles. Super Mario 64 revolutionised platforming as the genre moved to three dimensions, The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time remains one of the most beloved games in our history, and one can make the case that few first-person shooters have lived up to Goldeneye's legacy. The list goes on, longer than one would think from the minisc
