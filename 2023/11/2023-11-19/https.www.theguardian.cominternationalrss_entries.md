<p>The Aquaman star returns to host a subpar Thanksgiving episode that lampoons George Santos once again and Biden’s comments about Xi Jinping</p><p>Saturday Night Live opens with President Joe Biden’s (Mikey Day) press conference following his meeting with Chinese president Xi Jinping. Biden brags about the “total win” of a meeting, in which he secured “more pandas” for America, only to immediately undo his accomplishment by calling resident Xi a dictator.</p><p>After dodging a question about the border, he brings out one of those aforementioned pandas (Bowen Yang) to distract the fickle press. The panda is frightened about a potential second Trump term that could lead to a civil war, but not enough to endorse Biden in the election.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/nov/19/saturday-night-live-jason-momoa-host">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Wearing it has long been an act of defiance, seduction – and even a way into the afterlife. The remarkable story of eyeliner, makeup’s sharpest weapon</p><p>One of my closest friends while I was growing up in the UK was May, an Egyptian who wore bell-bottoms and scrunchies and who lived in the same building complex as us. I was 12, she was 14; her parents were less strict than mine and so she had started to wear makeup. While hanging out after school one afternoon, she decided to “make me over”. With Ace of Base blasting from her stereo, she carefully drew eyeliner on to my lids and kohl along my waterlines before curling my lashes with mascara. When I looked in the mirror, I was shocked; it was as if I could finally see myself, as if I had somehow come into focus.</p><p>This was the first of many bonding experiences with the women of my life and with eyeliner: I’d later find myself reapplying it with girlfriends in the darkly lit bathrooms of Beirut’s seedy nightclubs; making pan

## We’re constantly being told to feel good…

But feeling bad brings its own kind of power<p>Do you know what I’ve come to believe? I’ve come to believe that it’s good to feel bad. Not all the time, of course, not continuously. I mean, it’s not good to lie still, in chronic pain, with horrific memories or insults or bitter thoughts smashing relentlessly against the roof of your mouth. But sometimes, regularly, it is good to feel bad. To feel despair. A little dread. To feel sadness. To give up the idea (one that the wellness industry has long insisted upon) that we should be striving, always, for permanent and unblemished contentment.</p><p>Wellness, in fact, goes further: not only should we be free of stress, have optimised our orgasms and our work days, not only should our skin be radiant and our bowel movements exquisite, not only should we give ‘zero fucks’, striding across the street confident as an idiot, not only should creativity flow through us like tea, not only should we indefinitely hold off death by means of meditat

They talk about how, as their audience has grown, their outfits have shrunk</p><p>No written description quite captures the joy-inducing positivity of their online videos: bopping along to Taylor Swift in slinky striped swimwear; countless dance trends and TikTok challenges, completed in various seductive states of undress. Twirling and whirling in only feather boas and Speedos to Kylie. Clips neatly edited to cut from outfit to outfit, often climaxing in the skimpiest of one-piece swimwear. Over the last six years, the foursome have become certified social media superstars, but not like any other. “We’re The Old Gays,” they say, collectively, “a TikTok sensation with 11 million followers and counting. And if you’re not on TikTok, honey, you’re living in the past.”</p><p>Today, the four are sitting squarely together in front of a laptop camera: two on low chairs upfront, the others
