Digital Bros, the parent company of 505 Games and a number of other gaming subsidiaries, has announced an "organisational review" that'll see it lay off approximately 30% of its workforce.
</p><p>
As per its own recent figures, Digital Bros currently 442 people across the company, meaning its newly announced layoffs will likely impact around 130 employees.
</p><p>
The company says it's making the cuts after reviewing projects across its development studios and publishing units - which include 505, Assetto Corsa developer Kunos Simulazioni, Puzzle Quest studio Infinity Plus Two, and Terraria mobile developer DR Studios - in order to "align with the evolving competitive environment [and] ensure maximum operational efficiency."

Netflix has confirmed its new stop-motion Pok&eacute;mon series, Pok&eacute;mon Concierge, will release on 28th December this year - and there's a fresh two-minute trailer to accompanying the news.
</p><p>
Pok&eacute;mon Concierge, which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stop-motion-pokemon-concierge-anime-coming-to-netflix">announced at the Pok&eacute;mon Presents showcase</a> back in February, follows the adventures of Haru, a new concierge at a southern island hotel resort for Pok&eacute;mon. According to Netflix's brief blurb for the show, Haru "gradually discovers herself as she and her fellow staff members scramble to attend to the various Pok&eacute;mon guests."

If it's indies you want, you're in luck (as long as you're specifically wanting them on Switch); Nintendo has aired another instalment of its Indie World showcase, this time bringing news of a canceled Shantae revival, plague-themed turn-based tactics, a launch date for developer Inkle's gorgeous hiking adventure A Highland Song, news of Outer Wilds' long-awaited Switch release, and more. If you're looking to catch up on the excitement, or simply need a reminder, you'll find a full breakdown of everything featured during the show below.

A Highland Song, the beautiful "open platforming" adventure from Heaven's Vault and 80 Days developer Inkle, is almost here and will be launching for Switch and PC on 5th December.
</p><p>
A Highland Song tells the story of teenager Moira McKinnon who one day decides to run away from her life of relative seclusion in a small house on the edge of the Scottish Highlands, after recieving a letter from her Uncle Hamish, inviting her to his lighthouse on the coast.
</p><p>
What follows is yet another genre shift for the ever-ambitious Inkle. This time, the acclaimed studio - which has previously dabbled in the likes of visual novels, turn-based strategy, exploratory adventuring, and murder mystery - is combining its acclaimed narrative expertise with 2.5D platforming, as Moira sets off on a journey across the Highlands, whe

A strategy RPG entry feels like a natural continuation for the Phantom Thieves, trading away social mechanics for a more contained adventure with cartoony visuals. The new characters steer this story well and despite some minor issues, Tactica delivers a fine follow-up.</p><p>Returning to the Metaverse, Tactica ditches the Palaces and Jails for The Kingdoms, each led by authoritarian rulers and their Shadow-like Legionnaires. Finding treasure and infiltration routes is no longer required, though it's an otherwise familiar structure of toppling these tyrants as the Phantom Thieves fight for freedom. The team's joined by Erina, a likeable and spirited Rebel Corp l

</p><p>
The upgrade to Unreal Engine 5 allows for a more stable foundation for future features, Coffee Stain has said, as well as a new lighting system, vehicle and sound overhauls, and additional granular keybind options.

Nintendo has announced a new Nintendo Switch OLED and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe bundle, which also includes three months of Nintendo Switch Online. 
</p><p>
It's set to launch next Monday 20th November - just in time for Black Friday - priced &euro;349 at select retailers or direct from Nintendo via the My Nintendo Store. 
</p><p>
A Nintendo Switch bundle featuring Mario Kart 8 has become something of a Black Friday staple - though previous years have featured a regular launch model Switch rather than the improved OLED upgrade.

Developer Starbreeze is bringing two of its 'classic' Payday 2 heists to Payday 3 as part of a free update. 
</p><p>
The update, which is scheduled for later this month, will include two 'Legacy Heists' from Payday 2.
</p><p>
The heists in question are Cook off and Turbid Station. Starbreeze says their arrival will allow players to "relive the thrill and excitement" of the previous game's heists, but with a slight reimagining and improved gameplay.

First unveiled about three and a half years ago, the best UE5 efforts - The Matrix Awakens and Fortnite - have come from Epic Games itself, with early third-party releases largely falling short of expectations. There's a palpable sense that the engine hasn't gotten a proper third-party workout, or at least one that doesn't come with certain caveats and reservations. </p><p>Enter RoboCop: Rogue City. This first-person shooter from Polish developer Teyon packs the full suite of UE5 features - including Lumen GI and reflections, virtual shadow maps, and Nanite geometry - while targeting 60fps on console platforms as well. Initial impressions are positive, but how do the various techniques come together to produce high-quality final imagery - and do these features scale gracefully

Something surprising happened when we sat down last week to write about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/things-we-want-to-see-in-gta-6">what we wanted to see more of</a> in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>. Two of us, independently, wanted to write about radio stations. If you've read the piece you'll know that Ed wrote a lovely section on his need for an 80s radio station to bring him the perfect Miami vibes. I was going to write about Non-Stop-Pop and its host DJ Cara. (Ed's piece was so good in the end I found some other bobbins to write about.)

Maybe it's not surprising that more than one of us wanted to write about the radio. Radio has been a part of GTA since the very beginning, after all. I can remember very clearly sitting in my rented room in th
