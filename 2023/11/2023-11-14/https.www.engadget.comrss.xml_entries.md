In fact, many Americans won’t switch for fear of the perceived social stigma that comes with the green chat bubbles iMessage assigns to messages from Android phones. Google has tried a few different things to convince Apple to open the platform, including turning to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-and-eu-mobile-carriers-push-european-commission-to-force-apple-to-open-imessage-110558675.html">European Commission for regulatory relief</a>.

<p>Venmo says it's easy for anyone in the group to add expenses and it will automatically figure out the amounts due. The feature is designed to be ongoing, so if you often go to dinner with the same bunch of friends or travel with your family every year, you'll be able to manage expenses within the same group for the long haul.</p>

<p>As computer accessories go, the humble webcam doesn’t get a ton of attention. Two or three brands tend to dominate the market and almost everything looks, well, webcamy? Opal entered the scene in 2021 with its <a href="https://opalcamera.com/opal-c1">C1 model</a>. The idea was simple, to sexy-up the humble old webcam with a high quality sensor, a slick design and (for mac users at least) companion software that didn’t feel like a grind to use. Today, the company unveils its second camera, <a href="https://opalcamera.com/opal-tadpole">the Tadpole</a>, and it’s something quite different.</p>
<p>Just one glance at the Tadpole and obviously it's a big change from the C1 or really almost any other webcam out there. For starters it’s designed for laptops, which is evidenced in the tiny form-factor. This idea, the company claims, was inspired by the discovery that over 40 percent of people buying the C1, were using it with a laptop. Macbooks and most PC laptops come with a webcam built-i

<p><a href="https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/our-approach-to-responsible-ai-innovation/">YouTube has announced new steps to combat AI misuse</a> and misinformation that will roll out over the coming months. The new policies address transparency in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-tests-ai-generated-video-summaries-140259921.html">videos made using AI</a> and the rampant issue of deepfakes. YouTube is making it &quot;possible to request the removal of AI-generated or other synthetic or altered content that simulates an identifiable individual, including their face or voice.&quot;</p>
<p>Individuals can submit calls for removal through YouTube's <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/142443?sjid=5224581099112901529-NA">privacy request process</a>, but the company will weigh the decision based on whether it's satire or if the person can be uniquely recognized — such as a public figure. Similarly, musicians or their representatives can also request the removal of

<p>There are dozens of smartwatches out now to consider, when just a few years ago, the market was much less crowded. Today, the wearable world is filled with various high-quality options, and a few key players, like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-series-9-review-freedom-from-touching-your-screen-130009764.html">Apple Watch</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsungs-galaxy-watch-6-review-evolution-not-revolution-120006375.html">Samsung Galaxy Watch</a> and Fitbit Versa, have muscled their way to the front of the pack with their smart features. Maybe you've been eyeing a couple of smartwatches and haven't been able to decipher which will be best for you, or maybe you've been wearing a smart timepiece for quite some time and think it's about time for an upgrade. Regardless of which camp you fall into, the list of specs you’ll want to consider before deciding which is the best smartwatch for you to buy is a long one, and we'll help you make sense of it.

## The Morning After: Sony whiffs another gaming handheld

<p>In the history of modern gaming handhelds, Sony was there in the fairly early days with the PSP and Vita. Both were well regarded, if flawed, living and dying long before the age of the Switch and the Steam Deck. So it would be reasonable to expect the new<a href="https://www.engadget.com/playstation-portal-review-a-baffling-handheld-for-no-one-but-sony-diehards-201558485.html"> <ins>PlayStation Portal, which marks Sony’s return to handhelds</ins></a>, would be a triumph. <em>Yeah. About that.</em></p>
<p>Portal is a $200 handheld that can only stream from your own PlayStation 5, either at home or when you’re on the go. There are no local titles, or any bells and whistles for that matter, it’s just a way to play on your own PS5 when the TV isn’t available. Devindra Hardawar<a href="https://www.engadget.com/playstation-portal-review-a-baffling-handheld-for-no-one-but-sony-diehards-201558485.html"> <ins>has been testing one for a while and the obvious flaws remain obvious</ins></a>.

## Ableton Live 12 can create MIDI riffs and has a new synth to play them

<p>It was almost exactly three years ago that we were celebrating the relatively quick arrival of Ableton Live 11. Today, the company is unveiling Live 12, the next version of its popular digital audio workstation (DAW). In terms of release cycles, this is the shortest time between versions in recent memory, and it brings with it some exciting new features. The less fun news is that you won’t actually be able to get your hands on Live 12 until early next year, but there’s plenty to get excited about in the meantime.</p>
<p>Usually, the first thing people want to know is if there are any new instruments, and the answer is yes. Live 12 Suite comes with “Meld” which the company describes as a macro oscillator synth, and there’s also a new distortion effect called Roar. Other updates include a feature where Live 12 will create MIDI arrangements or transform existing ones via new tools in Live’s Clip view. There’s also an option to track the scale and key of what you’re working on so that

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-09-08-zelle-launches-september-12th.html?_fsig=AOo4gd_4f1.jooTlfEJKUg--%7EA">Zelle</a> recently made a huge change to its policy that would give victims of certain scams the chance to get their money back. The payment processor has confirmed to Engadget that it started reimbursing customers for impostor scams, such as those perpetrated by bad actors pretending to be banks, businesses and government agencies, as of June 30 this year. Its parent company Early Warning Services, LLC, said this "goes beyond legal requirements."&nbsp;</p>
<p>As <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/cybersecurity/payments-app-zelle-begins-refunds-imposter-scams-after-washington-pressure-2023-11-13/"><em>Reuters</em></a> noted when it reported Zelle's policy change, federal laws can only compel banks to reimburse customers if payments were made without their authorization, but not when they made the transfer themselves.

<p>If you've ever wondered what would make <em>Neon Genesis Evangelion</em> fans go berserk, look no further than ASUS. The PC maker brought its $700 <a href="https://rog.asus.com/motherboards/rog-maximus/rog-maximus-z790-hero-eva-02-edition/">ROG Maximus Z790 Hero EVA-02 Edition</a> motherboard to the US in September, and over time, eagle-eyed users finally started noticing a small typo in the anime brand: you get "EVANGENLION" instead of "EVANGELION." In other words, someone at ASUS was probably watching dubs while accidentally adding the extra "n" here.</p>
<p>This mistake can be spotted alongside the "Polymo lighting" I/O cover panel, which has a display that switches between the iconic red mecha and its stubborn pilot, Asuka. As pointed out by <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/asus-rog-eva-typo/"><em>Digital Trends</em></a>, the official product shots also contained said typo at the time of publishing this article. Interestingly though, this wasn't the case with t
