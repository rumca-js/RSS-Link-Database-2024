Horsham were vastly improved in the second half but Barnsley held firm and will travel to League Two’s bottom side Sutton in the second round.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/nov/14/fa-cup-roundup-barnsley-horsham-crewe-derby">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In her film on the schoolgirl turned wife of Elvis Presley, the director keeps her heroine at a maddening remove</p><p>Priscilla, Sofia Coppola’s new film on the former wife of Elvis Presley, introduces its heroine as she is for most of the movie: surrounded by people yet psychologically alone, her interiority – thoughts, warmth, motivations, contradictions – kept at a remove. She is 14 years old, and sitting at a cafe at an army base in West Germany with her schoolwork, without friends and seemingly without much guile.</p><p>Coppola’s pacing is brisk; her Priscilla, played mesmerizingly by Cailee Spaeny, is summarily whisked into a teenage fan-girl fantasy that seems too good to be true and will provoke many viewers to check the Wikipedia to confirm the extraordinary facts. One of Elvis’s friends invites her to a party at his place; the 24-year-old matinee music idol eyes her, dolled up in the finery of a high school freshman; he asks for time with her alone.</p> <a href="https:/

<p>My grandma has sewn every costume and baked every birthday cake. Now, I can give her my time</p><p>It’s Monday morning, and I should be at work. Instead I’m in a draper’s shop on the high street in Hythe, Kent, helping my 86-year-old grandma buy elastic. “Elastic <em>bands</em>?” the assistant asks. “No, knicker elastic,” Grandma says firmly. She tuts. “Mine’s getting all worn out.”</p><p>Ten minutes later we leave with the elastic in a paper bag, along with some shoulder pads, which Grandma intends to sew into a jacket. She will do this with the same ease she exhibits when replacing her knicker elastic. There’s no question of her buying new ones, as I would. “Nearly lunchtime,” Grandma says (it’s 10.30am). “I’ve made a lovely quiche.”</p><p>Ellie Keel is a writer and theatre producer, and the founder director of the <a href="https://womensprizeforplaywriting.co.uk/">Women’s Prize for Playwriting</a></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/nov/14/visiting-grand

<p>In the Ozempic era, the craze for thinness is everywhere. But if you concentrate specifically on what your body can do, it is sometimes possible to rearrange your brain</p><p>I have grown two hard lumps on my arms. They are deltoids, apparently. I have never been remotely aware of having deltoids before – I always assumed my shoulders simply elongated into a formless mass of flesh that eventually gave way to the rest of my limbs. But now I have deltoids. They are small, hard and perfect, and yes, even though they only occasionally emerge when I rest my elbows on hard surfaces, they’re a reminder that your body can still surprise you.</p><p>Right now, the ideal body has never looked more different.

<p>Killing critically endangered sturgeon to extract their eggs is not only unethical but unnecessary, say advocates of a more sustainable method</p><p>The turning point for polar and marine scientist Angela Köhler came in 2005, when she attended a demonstration on caviar production in the Caspian Sea. Bringing out a two-metre female sturgeon in front of 150 conference guests, the caviar master beat the fish on the head to death before cutting its belly open. “The masters suddenly became extremely nervous,” she recalls. “They went on to say that the eggs were too close to spawning and so they couldn’t use them as caviar. They discarded the entire fish and began the process again with a new one.”</p><p>The brutality of the moment is something Köhler still remembers. As an expert in environmental toxicology, she was at the conference to study the damage to sturgeon populations and the Caspian Sea caused by chemical pollution. But the experience set her on a new mission: to find a way t

<p>In the toxic manosphere, fasting is seen as a mark of strength and self-reliance. I can think of another word for it</p><p>‘Food’s awful and eating sucks.” Thus spake Andrew Tate, on X (formerly Twitter). “I hate eating. I hate feeling full,” he elaborated, before broadening, in his trademark fashion, the personal to the universal: “Imagine how stupid you have to be to find food entertaining. Literally embarrassing.”</p><p>It is not at all unusual, in the toxic manosphere, to see hunger as a human frailty to which you, as the ultimate man, are immune. Jordan Peterson has a not dissimilar relationship with food, having once gone on a months-long diet of nothing but beef, salt and water. He ended up in a coma in 2019, yet insists that wasn’t due to the steak but rather, his dependence on clonazepam, a type of tranquilliser. You have to wonder whether, whatever the immediate causes of his nine solid days unconscious, the odd vegetable might have helped. He once also claimed to have g

I remember my mounting alarm as the jokes fell away, and the audience was confronted with a near-messianic oration about the ways Izzard now intended, through politics, to heal the world. It’s a dream that may inch closer to reality this winter, as Izzard runs for the Labour candidacy in the seat of Brighton Pavilion. At the same time, she gets back on stage for a global standup tour, Remix, revisiting routines from the span of her 35 years in comedy.</p><p>Coincidence? Or a cunnin

Why she is chosen to come to this particular podunk municipality isn’t clear at first, but by and by we learn that Maben has a connection to the place. However, her return is far from joyful considering once she’s checked herself and Annalee into a seedy motel and put the little one to bed, she makes a half-hearted attempt to turn a trick in the car park which goes horrifically wrong when a local sheriff (Shiloh Fernandez), arrests her, rapes her, and then calls his buddies to come over and have a turn. From there, things just get worse, if that’s conceivable.</p><p>Meanwhile, in another part of town around the same time, newly released convict Russell (G

<p>Everyone knows what the West Ham midfielder can do from a dead ball but virtually nobody seems to know how he does it</p><p>The ritual is almost religious in its precision. He bounces the ball twice on the spot. Spins it around in his hands so the Nike swoosh faces upwards. Places it lightly on the ground. Four steps back at a 45-degree angle. A little shuffle to set his feet. A little wipe of the nose on his sleeve. One last look at the target. And then the tiniest pause, the pause that all great art requires. The fractional instant when the picture is already painted, but James Ward-Prowse is the only one who can see it.</p><p>The first movement is actually backwards: a little quarter-step, the recoil that will give him the momentum for what follows. And then the explosion: four lightning-fast strides, the last of which ends with the left foot planted tight and the right leg sprung so far back that the calf is touching the hamstring.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/foot

The pinnacle of European football remains the only piece of silverware that has eluded Hayes in her trophy-laden 11-year tenure at the club.</p><p>Hayes points to the fact that she has a winners’ medal from 2007 when she was assistant coach at Vic Akers’s all-conquering Arsenal. “I have already won the Champions League, and that meant the world to me,” she said recently. “I’ve already won it and I know what my role was in that team, and I know the impact we all had on each other. So, it isn’t missing out of my cabinet. It’s very firmly there. I’ve got a gold one and I’ve got silver one. Would I like to do it as the manager of Chelsea? Of course, I’d love to.

<p>Hypnotic odd-couple story of a teenager struggling with her mental health and a carer exploring their gender</p><p>At times it feels like Canadian director Ashley McKenzie is setting a challenge with this: are you arthouse enough? Have you got the cinematic endurance? Her film is the story of a friendship between a neurodivergent teenager called Star struggling with her mental health, and a hospital volunteer newly immigrated from China. You could imagine it being turned into a quirky-cute odd-couple indie comedy with a superficial take on neurodivergence. Instead, McKenzie pulls us into Star’s reality, how she experiences the world. It’s a disorientating, unrelaxing two-hour experience, but rewarding.</p><p>It is set in the middle of winter in Nova Scotia, with snow up to the height of car roofs. Star (brilliantly played by Sarah Walker) has been admitted to hospital after drinking poison – not her first suicide attempt. A doctor recognises her from the last time, but Star doesn’

<p>Ugly, divisive rhetoric has been embedded in the Conservative party since the days of ‘moderates’ like Cameron and May</p><p>That Suella Braverman ever graced one of the great offices of state should forever dispel any illusions about our political establishment. She owed her grip on the Home Office to the tawdry cynicism of Rishi Sunak, whose thin technocratic veneer poorly disguises a man who burns with political ambition but doesn’t have the talent to match. Braverman’s endorsement of his leadership candidacy was important because, knowing that the average Tory member would probably view Genghis Khan as a milquetoast liberal, a chastened Sunak needed to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2022/oct/26/starmer-attacks-sunak-suella-braverman-reappointment-video">bolster his right flank</a> to prevent Boris Johnson from returning.

Why?</p><p>On the 11th floor of a suburban Hong Kong tower, an 86-year-old woman lived alone in a tiny, decrepit apartment. Her family rarely visited.

This is framed to the audience by former group member Josef Cycowski (Chip Zien), who goes by the nickname “Rabbi”. Now an elderly man, Rabbi introduces himself, then introduces an audition scene where the younger group members are first introduced to each other. It’s a lot of introductions for the opening 10 minutes of a musical, and it won’t be the last time that Harmony mistakes throat-clearing for ceremony. Perhaps the confusion is understandable; the musical has been on its way to Broadway for a quarter-century at this point, with Manilow and Sussman running versions of the show in San Diego, A
