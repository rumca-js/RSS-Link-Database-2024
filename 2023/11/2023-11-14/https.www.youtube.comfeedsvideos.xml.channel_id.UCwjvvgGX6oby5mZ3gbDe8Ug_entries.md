China's entire market is now weak, and the economy is in a downturn. Chinese people simply have no confidence in spending, and they don't have the money to spend on luxury goods as they used to. That's to say that some in the Australian business community haven't got a clear picture of what's going on. 
In the long run, Australia relies more on the US in terms of national security. In the event of a conflict between Australia and the CCP, Australia will have to side with the US. Therefore, it is unrealistic to expect a friendly and cozy relationship with the CCP. 
Perhaps in the future, more Australians will echo the words of Xi Jinping: not all pandas are cute.
