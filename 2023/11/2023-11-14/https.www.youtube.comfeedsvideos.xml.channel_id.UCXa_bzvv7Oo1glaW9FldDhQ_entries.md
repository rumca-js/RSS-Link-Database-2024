After a successful run on PC a year ago, Tuxedo Labs has finally released Teardown on current gen consoles PS5 and Xbox Series X. The transition isn't without a few minor flaws, but the game largely retains the core gameplay that makes it so fun in the first place along with its simple yet gorgeous visuals and rock solid performance.

In spite of the success the series has enjoyed, however, with Payday 3, it has very much taken several steps back, with significant issues holding back its design in a number of ways. Here, we take a look back at the history of Payday so far, how it has let itself down with its latest release, and whether it can still make a recovery in the months and years to come.
