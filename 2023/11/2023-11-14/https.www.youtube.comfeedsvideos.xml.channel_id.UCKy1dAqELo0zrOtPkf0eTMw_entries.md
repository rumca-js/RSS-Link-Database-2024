Persona 5 Tactica reviewed by Lean Hafer on PC. Also available on PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.

"When all is said and done, I had a really good time with Persona 5 Tactica. It's a smaller, easier, less epic experience than its JRPG big brother, but none of that spoils the adventure too much. The combat is quick, clever, and exciting, even if – along with the writing and art style – it seems geared toward younger players or an overall more casual experience. Getting to spend another 40-some hours with my beloved Shujin classmates and bob my head along to some of the best music in video games is well worth my time. Long live the revolution!"

## Marvel Studios’ Real Problem Is It Can’t Replicate Avengers: Endgame Fast Enough

Remember way back in 2019 when Avengers: Endgame blew us all away when Cap grabbed Mjonir and finally said the words, “Avengers, Assemble!” It was an epic moment and we’ve all been reliving it social media ever since. So how did Marvel Studios go from delivering that triumphant moment in filmmaking to being allegedly “in shambles” so soon after. What if that “Avengers, Assemble!” moment in Endgame is the whole problem. 
It seems like movie fans have alternating takes on what the future holds for the Marvel Cinematic Universe. After projects like Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, some fans said the mcu is in shambles, but is that even true? And what will it take for Kevin Fiege and Marvel Studios to change course?

Netflix is taking on the Terminator with a new anime series based on the James Cameron sci-fi franchise. Titled ‘Terminator’, the anime will take place two days from August 30th, 1997, a date that the teaser states everything changes. In Terminator 2: Judgement Day, August 29th 1997 is the date Sarah Connor exclaims Judgement Day will occur, where Skynet gains sentience and nukes civilization. So right now, it’s not yet clear if the anime will overlap with any of the events of the movies at all but the actual date of “Judgment Day” has moved around a bit since T2, and Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, The Sarah Connor Chronicles, Terminator Salvation, and Terminator Genisys have played a little fast and loose with the timeline - Meanwhile, the most recent sequel, Terminator: Dark Fate basically acts like the other movies never happened, creates a time paradox that prevents the future of T2 from happening, while also introducing ANOTHER evil AI besides Skynet, called Legion - but ei
