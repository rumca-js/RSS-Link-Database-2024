There&#8217;s generally been two reasons the U.S. government hasn&#8217;t tried to regulate data brokers or pass even a baseline privacy law, and it&#8217;s not, contrary to conventional wisdom, because it&#8217;s too hard.

I’ve noted my skepticism regarding the antitrust attacks on the current Google antitrust trial regarding how it pays to have its search placed as the default on Safari and other browsers/phones. Again, that does not mean I’m skeptical of all antitrust suits against Google, as some of the others (around advertising) appear to have significantly [&#8230;]

The UK government thinks the 2016 Investigatory Powers Act is due for an overhaul. But it has plenty of opposition. Some of the proposed amendments actually appear to be illegal. And at least one major tech company has threatened to exit the market if the proposed amendments become law. The so-called &#8220;Snooper&#8217;s Charter&#8221; has always [&#8230;]

As some folks know, back in 2005, right here on Techdirt, I coined “The Streisand Effect,” as a throwaway line at the end of a post. It was in reference to a story from two years earlier regarding Streisand suing photographer Ken Adelman after he had started the California Coastal Records Project, in which he [&#8230;]

At the same time, Carr routinely turns a blind eye to the endless sleazy behavior in the sector he actually regulates: telecom. He doesn&#8217;t much care about predatory pricing, privacy violations, or the way companies like AT&#38;T [&#8230;]
