Both have long been valued for their fragrance, flavor, and medicinal properties. India is the lead consumer of nutmeg as well as one of the top global suppliers.\n\nOne Indian town, Pollachi, has found ways to create some of the best-quality mace and nutmeg while effectively cutting out middlemen and selling directly to buyers. A kilogram of its mace sells for around $50 \u2014 more costly than mace from India's lead producer, Kerala, which sells for $35 per kilogram, and the US, at $9 per kilogram. So what makes Pollachi's nutmeg and mace so special?
