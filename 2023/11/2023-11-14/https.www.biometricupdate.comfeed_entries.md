		The sum total of human knowledge may be moving from pocket to lapel, with the release of Humane’s Ai Pin, a connected wearable looking to replace the smartphone as humanity’s go-to communication device and/or technological crutch. Reports in <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/humane-ai-pin-700-dollar-smartphone-alternative-wearable/">Wired</a>, the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/humane-ai-pin-3311391e">Wall Street Journal</a> and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/wearable-ai-pin-launched-by-humane-backed-by-ex-apple-execs-microsoft-2023-11-09/">Reuters</a> say the smart-badge is intended to be worn like a brooch, corsage, or <a href="https://www.startrek.com/en-ca/news/starfleet-insignia-explained">Starfleet insignia</a>, and comes equipped with a camera, text messagi

		Enterprise identity authentication software maker Badge has been awarded a U.S. patent (<a href="https://ppubs.uspto.gov/pubwebapp/external.html?q=(11799642).pn.&amp;amp;db=USPAT&amp;amp;type=ids">11799642</a>) for a biometric public key system that enables <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202305/openid-recommends-steps-for-governments-to-protect-the-privacy-of-digital-ids">revocable</a> credentials.

A biometric public key is created that is partly dependent on an individual's biometric data, but without storing that data on devices. Authentication takes place using only the biometric, and by not relying on a hardware root of trust, can work on any device. The biometric template is created with “Sparse Representation” and additive noise, which the de

		Digital identity is having its moment. Close to 60 percent of consumers in the UK and the U.S. use some form of digital wallet, while more than a third of organizations are planning to include digital IDs in their organization, according to a <a href="https://curity.io/resources/documents/report-plotting-the-roadmap-for-digital-identity/?utm_source=pr&amp;utm_medium=press-release&amp;utm_campaign=digital-identity-report">survey</a> from software maker Curity.

		A UK judge has ruled that former Uber Eats delivery driver Edrissa Manjang can amend and pursue claims that he was kicked off the ride-sharing app as a result of a racially-biased algorithm in its face biometric system, according to <a href="https://www.law360.com/articles/1764691/uber-eats-must-face-ai-racial-bias-claim">Law360</a>.

The judge had first accepted the amended claims in July 2022 after Uber Eats gave information that contradicted his original claims. She also, however, ruled Manjang can not use emails the company sent him about the system as evidence of harassment. The judge decided the emails were protected by judicial proceedings immunity because the company sent them during litigation and can therefore not be held liable for them. Manjang's harassment, indi

		Elections held on November 11 to pick governors in three Nigerian states of Bayelsa, Imo and Kogi were marred by reports of major irregularities including over-voting, according to multiple local media reports.

These claims come despite the availability of the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) deployed for the polls by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).

The BVAS is a two-factor biometric authentication system to verify the identity of registered voters before they cast their ballots at the polling station.

The allegations of over-voting were most pronounced in the state of Kogi, with two losing candidates in the governorship race alleging that results in some Local Government Areas (LGAs) showed the number of votes cast surpassed the number

		The Council of the European Union on November 13 adopted two regulations which pave the way for the implementation of a digital visa application system for people entering the Schengen area.

In a press release, the Council said the adoption of the rules means the putting in place of an EU visa application platform through which all Schengen visa requests will be made, with a few exceptions.

The EU says <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202306/eu-unveils-plan-for-digital-schengen-visas-in-push-to-ease-travel-document-applications">the digital visa plan is to make it easie</a>r for people to apply for and collect their travel documents.
