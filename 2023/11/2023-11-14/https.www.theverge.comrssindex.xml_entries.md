It features the quickest acceleration yet from a Polestar vehicle, a completely new Google-based infotainment system, lots of fresh designs, and the lowest carbon impact of any Polestar. But by far the most controversial feature is the Polestar 4’s lack of a rear window.</p>
<p id="J20G2M">Instead, the 4 uses a roof-mounted camera system that projects its view to the digital rearview mirror, which is positioned in the normal place in the cabin. This has been decried by many as being dangerous and

  <p id="q2nNZa">Instagram’s latest feature lets you limit your posts to just close friends. You could already share Stories and Notes with only the users on your close friends list, but including posts and Reels could drastically change how Instagram works.</p>
<p id="nHnW9A">Since you no longer have to share posts with your entire follower list, and other users can do the same, your Instagram feed could start to feel like it’s filled with posts from a more close-knit community. You see a green star next to the accounts of close friends, and expanding that “green list” to Reels could go a long way toward making the app feel more private.</p>
