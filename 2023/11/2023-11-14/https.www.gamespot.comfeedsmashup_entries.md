<p dir="ltr">Ana Nogueira (The Vampire Diaries, The Michael J. Fox Show) is set to write Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow, a standalone feature in development at DC Studios. The project, part of James Gunn and Peter Safran's revamped DC movie lineup, centers on the Kryptonian cousin of Superman. <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/supergirl-movie-woman-of-tomorrow-writer-1235646953/">The Hollywood Reporter</a> was first to report.</p><p dir="ltr">Nogueira's involvement with the Supergirl project began in 2022 when Warner Bros. initially enlisted her to write a Supergirl movie tied to The Flash. However, the oversight of the DC arm by Gunn and Safran prompted a restructuring, leaving Nogueira's initial project uncertain. The Supergirl film is now integrated into a new slate, diverging from former studio president Walter Hamada's earlier vision for DC Films.</p><p dir="ltr">The plot takes inspiration from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/james-gunn-announ

<p>Oscar-nominated director Ridley Scott has revealed that he was offered a superhero movie, but he passed on the opportunity. Speaking to <a href="https://deadline.com/2023/11/ridley-scott-napoleon-gladiator-2-joaquin-phoenix-interview-1235600742/">Deadline</a>, Scott said he remembers responding with, "'No thank you. Not for me.'" He didn't say if these were Marvel or DC films, however.</p><p>Scott--who is known for movies like Gladiator, Alien, Blade Runner, and Black Hawk Down--went on to say that he's already made a few superhero movies, at least according to his own definition.</p><p>"I think Sigourney Weaverâ€™s a superhero in Aliens. I think Russell Crowe's a superhero in Gladiator. And Harrison Ford is the super anti-hero in Blade Runner.

<p>Over the years, Atlus--the studio behind the Persona series, Catherine, and Shin Megami Tensei--has developed a reputation for the way it approaches adult themes and dark topics unabashedly. While this generally makes for an M rating and the mild discomfort that accompanies the clumsy handling of delicate situations, it also makes complete sense. Many of the studio's titles explore humanity and the human condition, both of which contain their fair share of darkness and messy situations. They're ambitious topics to explore, and for that, I've always had tremendous admiration for Atlus and its Persona series in particular. But even more important than simply starting the conversation is the way the studio frames it--how it juxtaposes the darkness against powerful messages about courage, morality, hope, and idealism to make everything more meaningful. These things combined are what make Persona so beautiful--what shapes its identity.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/

<p>Ubisoft has revealed some of the features that PS5 players can expect when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora/">Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</a> launches in December. One of the more impressive figures thrown out is related to haptic feedback, as Ubisoft is touting "well over 400 unique haptic effects" that'll be felt through the PS5's DualSense controller.</p><p>According to Ubisoft, you'll receive feedback from the reactive flora around you as the Helicoradian plants will fold in on themselves whenever you are close to them. The presence of heavy animals like the Sturmbeest and Soundblast Colossus will be felt as they draw closer, and the roar of a Thanathor as it stalks you will send a few jolts down your hands. Then there are more environmental effects, like waterfalls, lightning strikes, heavy wind, rain hitting your weapons, and the sensation of focusing on the world of Pandora around you when you engage your Na'vi senses.</p><p>The DualSense

<p dir="ltr">2012's Arrow started a flood of superhero shows on network television and streaming alike that brought us hits like Daredevil, long-running stories like The Flash, and ambitious experiments like Crisis on Infinite Earths. One of the weirdest and best shows from that time, though, was DC's Doom Patrol. With the show having just wrapped its fourth and final season, we now say goodbye to Cliff, Larry, Rita, Jane, and the other weirdos they met along the way.</p><p dir="ltr">The premise of Doom Patrol bears a striking resemblance to that of the X-Men at the surface level: A wise old man in a wheelchair lives in a mansion with a bunch of frustrated but superpowered individuals who have to come together as a team--despite their trauma and drama--to rise to the call of heroism in a world that hates them. But the similarities end there. Where X-Men claims to be a story about people living with their differences in the real world, though, it's ultimately about extremely hot peopl
