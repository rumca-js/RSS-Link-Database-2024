This seems to be the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/695445891770760">performance
bonus program</a>. I think they offered it to me because my Facebook

mode</a> and I post a lot?  It's all very unclear, including what

me?  Would this affect how the algorithm prioritizes my writing?
Would they attempt to exert editorial control?  One way to find out!
