<p>Setback for challengers who say Trump should be barred from presidential run under ‘insurrection’ clause of 14th amendment</p><p>Donald Trump can appear on the ballot for the Republican primary in Michigan, a state judge ruled on Tuesday, a setback to challengers who argue he is constitutionally disqualified from being president because of his actions on 6 January 2021.</p><p>The lawsuit is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/aug/20/trump-disqualified-constitution-section-3-14th-amendment">one of several</a> that left-leaning groups have filed across the country arguing that section 3 of the 14th amendment bars Trump from holding office. The provision says anyone who takes an oath to the United States and then engages in “insurrection” or “rebellion” against the nation cannot hold office unless Congress votes by two-thirds majority to allow them. The measure was adopted after the civil war and has not been tested.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023
