This innovation promises to drive the 1.6T optical transmission era by late 2025. Broadcom and NVIDIA are anticipated as early adopters, signaling a transformative leap in high-performance computing (HPC) and AI applications.</p> <p>Key to this breakthrough is the trial production of the micro ring modulator (MRM) using TSMC\u2019s cutting-edge 3nm process. This paves the way for replacing traditional copper interconnects with faster, more efficient optical transmission, overcoming signal interference and heat issues in HPC systems.</p> <p>However, challenges remain in the complex production and packaging of CPO modules. TSMC may collaborate with external providers to ensure scalability. Despite this, NVIDIA plans to incorporate CPO technology in its GB300 chips by 20",
