<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Let’s be for real. It’s just my opinion tho of course lol. Are there many live performances out there which really do top Layne’s performance specifically? Felt like he was singing at his own funeral. Visibly dark. You can tell he is going through hell. I can think of Eddie’s Black performance in MTV close when it comes to vocals but yeah. Gone too soon but Grunge always has been hit with unfortunate tragedies. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/AverageZeek62"> /u/AverageZeek62 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1hrccqy/alice_in_chains_mtv_performance_1996/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1hrccqy/alice_in_chains_mtv_performance_1996/">[comments]</a></span>

It&#39;s catered to music lovers and is essentially a social media app where you follow your friends and see what they have recently been listening to. The aim is to use your friends&#39; listening histories to discover new music! You have a feed that shows you the songs that your friends have recently listened to and in the feed you can listen to short previews of the songs, like them, comment on them and add them directly to your Spotify playlists. It would mean so much if some of you could download and sign up to Solance and get a few friends on board to test the app with!</p> <p>App link is <
