<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><em>The Story of an African Farm</em> by Olive Schreiner. I was looking forward to this novel set in 19th-century South Africa. Alas, I couldn&#39;t get more than a quarter through it. The nonstop religious/spiritual discussion, the flowery prose, and aspects of the plot--naive rubes taken advantage of by a con man, which is a type of story I hate--but wait, there&#39;s more--love unrequited, everybody is unhappy and half of them die (but very spiritually). It&#39;s a minor classic and I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a lot to be found in it, but not by me.<br/> Oh well. One more off the TBR pile.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ImportantAlbatross"> /u/ImportantAlbatross </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hrb8xh/first_book_of_2025_is_dnf/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hrb8xh/first_book_of_2025_is_dnf/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>The books are in the order I read them.</p> <p>1) <strong>Sula</strong> by Toni Morrison: Bleak and beautiful, the sentences flow and connect so seamlessly, it feels like gliding in the wind when reading her work. Highly recommended for anyone interested in American Literature.</p> <p>2) <strong>Failure is not an Option</strong> by Gene Kranz: An in depth account of what it was like to get the first man on moon. When you read about the magnitude of efforts involved, required, both on an organizational scale and the personal scale, it puts into perspective what a huge feat it was. Recommended for anyone who enjoys reading about how impressive humans are.</p> <p>3) <strong>Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less</strong> by Greg McKeown: An average self help book. Might be useful for upper management and leadership.</p> <p>4) <strong>The Checklist Manifesto: How to Get Things Right</strong> by Atul Gawande: An insightful book about the crucial ro

I especially enjoyed the restaurant and baking aspect</p> <p>The dos and donuts of love - Adiba Jaigirdar: super fun light-hearted ya romance with some great Bengali rep and the baking show aspect was very entertaining</p> <p>The handmaid&#39;s tale - Magaret Attwood: probably one of the most important reads in the feminist canon but her habit to never use quotation marks still drives me up the wall. Still thought it was worth having read it</p> <p>Anna and the French kiss - Stephanie Perkins: I did not expect to have this much fun with a book this summer. This was the perfect read for being on vacation in Italy. The French boarding school was right up my alley as well.</p> <p>The first move - Jenny Ireland: amazing juvenile arthritis rep so reading it was super worth it for that aspect. The romance itself feels a bit underdeveloped but all in all fine</p> <p>Der zerbrochene Krug - Heinrich v. Kleist:

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>To clarify, this is not about books released in 2024, but about the ones you personally read (although they can be both).</p> <p>I&#39;ve chosen some categories, but please add your own!</p> <p>Science fiction/fantasy: Red Side Story by Jasper Fforde. We waited a decade for this sequel and, while it wasn&#39;t perfect, it was worth the wait. I love Eddie and Jane as much as ever and am on tenterhooks for the final part of the trilogy (Fforde has promised it won&#39;t be another decade).</p> <p>Crime/thriller: The Hunting Party by Lucy Foley. Fantastic, edge of your seat page-turner, with a genuinely clever and surprising denouement (admittedly I&#39;m terrible at guessing whodunnit). My only complaint is that I stayed awake until the early hours to finish it and was knackered the next day.</p> <p>General fiction: Mother Naked by Glen James Brown. The most original book I&#39;ve read in years. The whole thing is a bard&#39;s monologue in &#39;medieval

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><strong>Should I review this? I&#39;d prefer not to.</strong></p> <p>Have I figured out the meaning of Herman Melville&#39;s <em>Bartleby, the Scrivener: A Story of Wall Street</em>? No. But then again, few people have. And that makes it perfect for a literature class, reading group, or discussion, because there are so many things to discuss about it.</p> <p>On the level of story, this novella is easy enough to read and understand, despite being a bit wordy at times. Melville also takes his time to paint the scene in the opening, by going into detail about the minor characters that populate his story. Turkey, Nippers, and Ginger Nut are the nicknames of three underlings who work in the office of the narrator, an elderly lawyer. But the interesting part comes when we meet Bartleby, a new recruit whose job as a scrivener is to copy and check documents by hand. At first Bartleby works very well, but after a while he politely declines his boss&#39;s requ

But after reading samples on the app (the Kindle app often has a full chapter or two to sample) and getting into more and more books, I&#39;ve started reading again. It is actually wonderful that Kindle allows for you to read more than just a few pages free of charge, and without even needing to own a kindle. For longer books, I began pairing the audiobook at night with my reading and this also got me back into reading more books. It made it easier to get through longer books with small print and I eventually was reading the small print at the same pace as I used to.
