MJ Lenderman is a musician from Asheville, North Carolina, who got obsessed with music and music-making after discovering My Morning Jacket in his parents’ music collection when he was fifth grader. After founding and playing in bands including Wednesday, Lenderman released "Manning Fireworks" in September 2024 under his own name (or at least under his initials; friends call him Jake). 

After playing a show in the First Avenue Mainroom the night before, MJ Lenderman brought his band The Wind into The Current studio to play songs from "Manning Fireworks." Watch them perform "You Don't Know The Shape I'm In" above.
