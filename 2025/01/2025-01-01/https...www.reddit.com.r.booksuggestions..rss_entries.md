I came upon Dark Matter by Blake Crouch and City of Thieves by David Benioff. I read those and turned page after page and finished both books in about four sittings.

I usually don&#39;t like too much drama happening in a story and i genuinely cannot stand romance at all. The only book series which I have completed in my life is Percy Jackson and I have read half of the harry Potter books. I am mainly into books relating to genres such as history, science , geography, mythology, space, nature etc. And please i don&#39;t want suggestions like encyclopaedias, autobiographys of historical leaders etc. Like I want good suggestions wherein I don&#39;t get bored reading the books itself. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/StatisticianOk682"> /u/StatisticianOk682 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1hr21cm/suggestions_for_books_to_read/">[link]</a></sp

Although the author name looked strange (Dead King) (not making fun) but the title piqued my interest. When I found it on Amazon the book cover looked good. </p> <p>I started reading the book and it was well written by the author. The unique way of narrating the story in two timelines with a very easy language was good. One another strange thing (in a good way) was the use of quotes in the book in between the scene switches. </p> <p>The story as the name suggest is a love story. I found it quite relatable. The main lead being an introvert is caught between tough real life situation where he doesn&#39;t know how to react and this happens with all of us. The story kept me hooked till the end. </p> <p>Wonderful book for a weekend read.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.c
