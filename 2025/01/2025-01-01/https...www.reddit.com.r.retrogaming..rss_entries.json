The game was a shooter of sorts. You had to move your character(s). Across the map of bad guys. You collected characters as you played who would all have significant/different shooting types. Like a spread shot or an exploding shot. They were usually captured and you had to pick them up and lead them to the goal to obtain these new characters. you could potentially&quot;lose&quot; then if they were struck and you couldn&#39;t recover them. there were tons of different characters you could pick up. the only thing was that you had take each character one by one across the level. there might have been a timer as well? if anyone has the slightest idea what I&#39;m talking about i would love some help finding this masterpiece. it was so fun and ate up so much of my gaming as a kid but i can not for the life of me remember the name or what ",

The resolution was 480p, it had wired controllers, and used a GD-ROM as its media (essentially a CD with tighter packed sectors of data). In fact; during the Zophar\u2019s Domain emulator era, the system existed and I remember using it to play emulators via the Utopia Boot Disc (who remembers that?)</p> <p>So tell me, moderators\u2026how is this not retro? ;) </p> <p>Comments welcome! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Zop",

I wanted to beat as many NES Hard games as I could (just using the Nintendo Hard wiki initially) initially, but I eventually just started beating whatever I felt like rather than only the hard ones. I\u2019ve still beaten a decent amount but nowhere near even the whole wiki list. Though, I\u2019ve been able to beat so many games I never got to play or finish as a kid which has been really fun. Posting pics of each end-screen has been another fun way of keeping track and remembering how it felt to beat them.

I&#39;ve been wanting to get the PCE + PCECD, but I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s the right one to get. I feel like I should get the Super Famicom. Got any suggestions?
