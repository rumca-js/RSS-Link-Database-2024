On Linux is not as snappy, it takes at least a second to fully show up. This is very consistent accross distros and different machines. Why ? I mean I can live with it if I understand why, but at the moment the concern that linux is generally less fast triggers me.</p> <p>Is it the because it&#39;s flatpak? or it has something to do with Waylan",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>As a person in the field of information technology, who also loves tinkering in their freetime, Ive had a bit of experience with linux. I was not looking forward to the switching process, since I was used to Windows. But I took it slowly for a year. I have not liked the direction Windows was going to, and seeing other proprietary companies following a similar path I decided open source is the only way to go. Ive been slowly switching my applications on the Windows machine to Linux compatible FOSS applications. As I got used to it and improved other privacy and security aspects in my life, I have decided to finish by the new year.</p> <p>I will be honest, it was quite a learning curve. Most of my experiences with Software was point and click. Ive never utilised the terminal/powershell in Windows besides executing a few Python scripts or changing settings and I honestly dont think Windows is worth my time to learn various commands (for now at least).
