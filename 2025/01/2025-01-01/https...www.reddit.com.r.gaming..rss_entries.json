If you go up a notch in difficulty, you now have to neutralize some alarms before jumping. If you pick the hardest difficulty, you have to do all of the above and also install a covert gadget and intercept some data flow.</p> <p>Are there any games that tried to do something similar? I know about Timesplitters, I believe it was made by some of the team that worked on the Rare FPS titles. I&#39;m really wondering if this is just something that was lost with time or if it&#39;s still something you see in modern games.</p> <p>Happy new year and thanks for reading.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https:/",

The worst has to be Space Engineers. Great game for building stuff, but the survival is just &#39;&#39;at intervals, run to the Medical Machine and press F for few seconds, also remember to throw in ice once per year&#39;&#39;. </p> <p>Most exploration games just have &#39;&#39;eat, drink, breathe&#39;&#39; as the survival mechanics, and easy-to-gather resources for it. To me they (survival elements, not the games) feel like an extra chore in a game not really built for them. Mechanics like &#39;&#39;food needs correct environment and nutrients to grow&#39;&#39; and hygiene, and making it complicated to build instead of just plopping down one machine make the game feel more in-d",
