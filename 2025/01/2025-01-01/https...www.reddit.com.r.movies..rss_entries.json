Better - in that it is funnier, and Bill Murray&#39;s performance is better than Chevy Chase&#39;s. Mad respect to Christmas Vacation - it is definitely a top shelf classic, and a must watch every December. I love them both. But if I can only take 1 to a deserted island, I&#39;m taking Scrooged. It&#39;s dark, and hilarious. Bill brings a vulnerable transformation as Scrooge, and it&#39;s my personal favourite adaptation of A Christmas Carol. Also Carol Kane for the win.

Short answer: Twitch streamer Northernlion and Cine2Nerdle Battles, the former a movie trivia machine, and the latter a movie-trivia PVP game. Hoping some folks are familiar with both or either as explaining makes this giant post even bigger. Anyway, those got me to finally make a Letterboxd, and set me on a movie frenzy which peaked in early January. So I figured I&#39;d try and get through a year&#39;s worth. One a day was already kind of out the window as I started late, but 365 seemed surprisingly doable given the appetite I suddenly had for it (and sure enough I went over). There were so many classics I hadn&#39;t seen, recent beloved movies I didn&#39;t get to see in theatre, etc. Hilariously, I actually thought I&#39;d &quot;run out&quot; of the best stuff before the year was out, but of course that&#39;s patently absurd, especially with some of the choices I made. I suppose I should apologize up front for the ani",

I am still trying to sort out in my mind what was real and what was a hallucination. Any thoughts? This movie is like \u201cInherent Vice\u201d. Both have Joaquin Phoenix tripping out and both juxtapose reality and hallucination. I found it easier to separate the two in \u201cInherent Vice\u201d. The noise complaint notes left in Beau\u2019s apartment were probably a hallucination. As far as plot goes, did Grace and Roger\u2019s daughter really commit suicide by drinking paint? The theater group commune was probably real but his placement in the plot was false. Did Beau kill his mom or did she die from a falling chandelier? I think the latter. Was the end a hallucination or judgment in the afterlife? Ari Aster sure makes some dark disturbing stuff. I thought \u201cMidsommar\u201d took the cake until I watched this one. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/thebradman70\"> /u/thebradman70 </a> <br",

Now that time has passed I\u2019ve watched it a handful of times since and noticed, during the Niagara Falls scene where he goes live for the first time, he gets frustrated at the news of Evan being the new news anchor, during, at the end, he ends his segment with, \u201cback to you f****ers\u201d in which I KNOW he held a middle finger up as response. However, everywhere I have watched it (the past few years) he is only holding a fist. Does ANYBODY recall this? I\u2019ve googled for screenshots or anything of the scene to verify and cannot anywhere find it.

The use of the infrared to portray an almost colorless world, Butler as Feyd Rautha, the brief glimpse you get into the culture, the fight scenes, the Fenring/Feyd scene. It just is so perfect. I&#39;m rewatching it tonight and even though I&#39;ve seen this movie five or six times this year - this part of the movie still makes me so hype. Everytime the creepy little arena guards dressed in black come on screen I get so excited because they are just sci fi perfection.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/terrordactyl200\"> /u/terrordactyl200 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hquf2d/the_giedi_prime_sequence_in_dune_part_two_is_one/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hquf2d/the_gi",

Been doing this since the pandemic in 2020 when you couldn\u2019t really go out; now it\u2019s just become a tradition whether alone or with friends. One my favorite disaster movies of all time with great cast and so many memorable moments- the ship turning upside down, stunt man Ernie Orsatti falling into the skylight in the dining room, climbing the Christmas tree, climbing up the shaft, the arguments between Gene Hackman and Ernest Borgnine, Shelley Winters saving Hackman from drowning, Hackman yelling at God while hanging on the steam valve. I saw it when it originally came out in 1972 and must have seen it at least once a year since then. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/srfnyc\"> /u/srfnyc </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hqu1wr/anyone_else_watchi",
