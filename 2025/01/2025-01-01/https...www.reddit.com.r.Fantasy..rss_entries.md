Liked the heirachry and power dynamics. Really liked the realistic consequences and gruesome events that unfolded.</p> <p>I&#39;ve started Sword of Kaigen but I am having trouble getting into it. With all the extra words it uses it can be a bit jarring to read imo. </p> <p>Mostly looking for more fantasy books that have magic/gods of some kind, with drastic and gruesome events. Not only violence, just real consequences.</p> <p>A personal favorite sequence was from The Burning God, when they were walking back south. The description of the starving people and how they reacted to small bits of food felt so real. Looking for fantasy books that

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I like books with morally grey characters. And I like books with very powerful characters. But somehow I can’t find a book that features both. </p> <p>I am basically looking for a book with a OP protagonist who is not a “goody” and is not holding back the whole time so as not to injure anybody. If somebody threatens him I expect him to react swiftly and mercilessly and remove the “problem” instead of contemplating about morals. And he should not just run around and save everybody but maybe have his own agenda. </p> <p>About OP part: I would prefer him to be OP from the beginning but he can also get there in the course of 2-3 books (but not 10+ books; I am not really looking for LitRPG or slow Progression). Bonus if it’s urban fantasy. And I am only looking for series with 3+ books. </p> <p>I’ve also heard a lot about Dresden Files…Would it fit my criteria?</p> <p>Thanks!!!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.

Yes, audiobooks count as reading, and if you disagree, feel free to fight me. </p> <p><strong>Disclaimer 2.0 Electric Boogaloo:</strong> This turned out to be much longer than I ever expected it to be, so buckle in.</p> <p>Initially, I didn’t have a set goal for how much I wanted to read in 2024. However, after reflecting on 2023, when I read 62 books (up from just 13 the previous year), I decided to aim higher. My goal for the year was 100 books. By early November, it was clear I wasn’t going to hit that target, mainly due to some hefty books I had to finish re-reading before a new release in December. So, I adjusted my goal to something more realistic, considering the size of the books I was reading. Most of my books were over 500 pages, so I set a new goal: 50,000 pages. </p> <p>In the end, I read 90 books, totaling a grand total of 51,169

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>If one measured the popularity of comic book characters by the number of comic books produced featuring them over the years, I think it&#39;s safe to say that at least the top four most popular sword-and-sorcery comic book characters are adaptations of a sort: Conan, Red Sonja, Elric, and Kull. While the sword-and-sorcery Red Sonja was really created by Roy Thomas for comic books based on the character Red Sonya that Robert E. Howard created for a historical fiction yarn, her existence in the Hyborian Age setting still makes her various comics series ineligible to be considered as having been created for comics as opposed to an adaptation in my opinion.</p> <p>In comparison to the hundreds upon hundreds of comic books featuring these characters, sword-and-sorcery comic books featuring characters and settings created originally for comic books have been relatively few and far between.

If any of you are looking for help or some enlightenment on this I actually watched a set of videos from a channel I&#39;ve grown to love on YouTube called Daryl Talks Games, while his content is strictly centered on video games, I think the lessons he learned while making these videos was extremely helpful for me. I often found myself struggling at times with what to read next and sometimes got paralyzed. Sometimes the chore of having to sift through what was in that pile. That changed this year in large part thanks to these videos. </p> <p>I am going to link them here: <a href="https://youtu.be/s3Ey6BH8jGM?si=h-C6yrTDIpuOJzNu">I Spent A Year Finishing My BackLog</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/BuszSU

## Voyage of the Damned by Frances White

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Frances White&#39;s debut is a dramatic fantasy murder cruise where the magical heirs of the 12 districts of the empire of Concordia start dropping dead one after the other! </p> <p>Ganymede (or Dee) feels like a pretender, a sheep in wolf&#39;s clothes, and never wanted to be there in the first place. Dee is a narrator with a really strong voice: sarcastic, sassy, both self-confident and insecure, fighting demons of the past, superior magical powers and his own darker thoughts. </p> <p>He has to navigate imperial politics, personal grievances and overcome his own guilt and grief to uncover the killer before it&#39;s too late - and he excels in this improv detective role accompanied by the oddest team possible. </p> <p>The backstory and the romance are intertwined in a fateful way, with multiple twists catching the reader by surprise again and again!</p> <p>White manages to create a story structured around the arcehtypie of the underdog hero structur

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Furies of Calderon (THAT scene)</p> <p><em>spoilers</em></p> <p>I’ve really enjoyed this book so far; I’d say it is very underrated in fact. But the weird gang-r*pe scene halfway through was just… wow. I’m doing my best to move past it, but it really has soured the book at the moment for me.</p> <p>I REALLY hate how much r*pe is in fantasy books in general, and was severely disappointed that this scene was here. Not only is it because I hate scenes like this, but in THIS book in particular, it felt extra wrong.</p> <p>The tone/feel of this book feels so far detached from that kind of stuff. The best way I can describe it is if you were reading Wheel of Time, and came across a random r*pe chapter. It just doesn’t fit in that series at all….</p> <p>And using r*pe to make evil characters more “evil”, or as a character growth for female characters is just really annoying.</p> <p>Anyway, I’m sure I’ll get over it and enjoy the rest of the series eventuall

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am talking like speculative fiction, something like John Marrs books. I fell in love with fantasy during the dystopian phase (not sure if it even counts) but I have never quite gotten over it. Anyone else feel that way? she world moved on but I certainly did not. </p> <p>I have read the majority of the popular and well known dystopian books so would really appreciate some niche recommendations! </p> <p>Some books I have enjoyed but not limited to: The Hunger Games, Red Rising, Tender is the Flesh, Never Let Me Go, anything by John Marrs, Octavia Butler, or Margaret Atwood! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/thaisweetheart"> /u/thaisweetheart </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1hqt67s/dystopian_recommendations/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1hqt67s/dystopian_recommendations/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Just curious on recommendations? </p> <p>I’ve typically been a diehard physical book guy but have listened to a few books. </p> <p>I was looking into Robin Hobb but sounds like the narrator is bad. My pops has the physical books so I may take those for a spin since I haven’t read them. </p> <p>For my tastes I enjoyed the drenai saga as a second/third read through done as a listen through. Enjoyed a couple of the Drizzt books (homeland and exile, and have sojourn primed). </p> <p>For physical reading I’m a WoT fan, Gemmel fan, Glenn Cook fan, Tad Williams fan (have yet to read the newer Osten Ard books), Erickson, Kay. When I was younger, and still think fondly of due to nostalgia, were Eddings, Salvatore, Donaldson, Rawn, McCaffrey. I never got into Sanderson aside from his finishing WoT</p> <p>Any further recommendations? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/JDVwrites"> /u/JDVwrites </a> <br/> <span
