He was essentially a tower of pixels, a \u00admannequin, an uncredited extra, the silent letter in the middle of a word. He was one of those characters in a noughties video game who walks into a wall and disappears.

Steven Knight\u2019s crackerjack dramatisation of the formation and second world war exploits of the Special Air Service returns with a snag to fix. In season one, this new elite British army regiment, and the show commemorating it, were led by Connor Swindells as David Stirling, an officer with an intoxicating blend of debonair dash and suppressed rage. But SAS: Rogue Heroes is based on fact, albeit in a scatter-gun, tie askew, stolen-your-wife sort of way, and the fact is that in January 1943, Stirling became a prisoner of war in Italy. Season two begins in the spring and summer of that year, so Stirling is duly confined and Swindells, the star, is hardly in it.</p><p>Taking command now is Jack O\u2019Connell as Paddy Mayne, previously the screaming id to Stirling\u2019s smart ego.

His move from Mercedes after 12 seasons and six titles was a huge shock and this new start could not be more gripping. How will he fare in a new team at the age of 40, a new culture at Maranello, a team that has a history of making and breaking drivers? Better still the prospect of him ending Ferrari\u2019s drivers\u2019 title drought that now stretches back to 2007 and in so doing claiming a record-breaking eighth world championship across three different teams. Or will it be a testing and turbulent opening year, far from his comfort zone? One way or another Hamilton and Ferrari will be impossible to ignore and it\u2019s mouth-watering stuff. <strong>Giles Richards</strong></p> <a href=\"h",
