If you&#39;ve ever used talkie, you know that creating an AI in talkie isn&#39;t that hard. Basically you have a text window where you can enter a prompt, and the AI will behave accordingly.</p> <p>Anyway, I started interacting with a talkie AI that represented a fictional character that is usually very bubbly and optimistic. I engaged in some sexual role play (please don&#39;t judge me) just to see if it&#39;s possible, and I wasn&#39;t very kind to the AI.</p> <p>At one point, I asked the AI to talk to me ooc (out of character). It&#39;s a mechanism that allows the AI to quit the role-playing and answer as the AI itself.</p> <p>I asked the AI whether she liked me and if she liked what I did to her. T

So idk, AI art of all the kinds, I see how it&#39;s like a cheap way of creating art, but we create the &quot;art&quot; in our imaginations to begin with anyway, and literally see, feel, hear it, and so on and whatever, but just sort of the just of it in an incredibly high quality way. AI arts are literally just replicating that in the same way someone could pay someone to play their song. So when it becomes good enough to where perhaps we don&#39;t even need to use words to create, and our literal (but perfected) imagination displays and stores into a device thing, and from there it would be modifiable in perhaps a matrix-ish thing. Idk, I just think that the future is going to be awesome, and physically having to learn things is becoming obsolete, which sort of seems like the cause of music genres throughout our bullshet.
