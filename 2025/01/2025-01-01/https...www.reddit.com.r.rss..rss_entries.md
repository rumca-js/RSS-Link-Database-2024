<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a journalist and subscribe to Reuters breaking news alerts, which are also available via a private RSS address that requires my login credentials to access. </p> <p>I&#39;m looking for an RSS reader to access their feed, which is password protected (so the reader must have an authentification feature). </p> <p>Equally as important is speed. These updates come at any time, sometimes once every few hours, other times several a minute. I need to see them as they come in, so a reader that can query and get the feed once every 10 seconds or so would be best. </p> <p>Would love to hear your suggestions.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/omarhani"> /u/omarhani </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1hr8rmo/suggestions_for_an_rss_reader_that_updates_a/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1hr8rmo/suggestions_for_an_rss_reader_that_up
