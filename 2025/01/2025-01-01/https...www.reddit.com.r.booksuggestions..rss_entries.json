When I found it on Amazon the book cover looked good. </p> <p>I started reading the book and it was well written by the author. The unique way of narrating the story in two timelines with a very easy language was good. One another strange thing (in a good way) was the use of quotes in the book in between the scene switches. </p> <p>The story as the name suggest is a love story. I found it quite relatable. The main lead being an introvert is caught between tough real life situation where he doesn&#39;t know how to react and this happens with all of us.
