Permission has to be granted by an Exchange admin on the Exchange server where it lists the homepage and reply urls of the sites in question.The 3rd party requested permissions range from the ability to read the Outlook calendar to write access to the individuals calendar as well as all calendars that have access to. I understand these apps would need read/write in order to update both the 3rd party app and Outlook calendar. I\u2019m a little concerned with granting that level of access especially is there is a security issue with the 3rd party app. What are your experiences with allowing 3rd party apps access to calendars? What potential risks are generated if there\u2019s a security event at the 3rd",
