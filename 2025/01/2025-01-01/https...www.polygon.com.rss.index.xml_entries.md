<p class="has-drop-cap has-text-align-none">The board game industry has a tough challenge on its hands.

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s impossible to predict how the year will shape up before it’s even begun, but that won’t stop me from laying out several titles that are hotly anticipated. These nine games caught my eye, promising a variety of compelling experiences. With any luck, a portion of my expectations will b
