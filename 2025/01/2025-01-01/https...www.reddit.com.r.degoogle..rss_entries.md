<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not a fan of paying monthly for everything from heated chairs (hey BMW fans) to mouse üñ±Ô∏è plans (yo Logi). I love apps where I can purchase licence, get good software without adds and don&#39;t think about life where I lose my job and everything stops working. So what apps are you using that are good and you paid once? My example would be Smart AudioBook Player, paid once, zero ads, fantastic dev support, reacts to every feedback with help or updates, constantly adds useful stuff. Poweramp is another one, paid once, using it for many years.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Nyoka_ya_Mpembe"> /u/Nyoka_ya_Mpembe </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/degoogle/comments/1hr61ep/apps_with_one_time_licence_purchase_instead_of/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/degoogle/comments/1hr61ep/apps_with_one_time_licence_purchase_instead_of/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Google just banned my account for no obvious logical reasons. I guess, I had made some Pro-russian statements in my blogger and YouTube, maybe that&#39;s the reason.

In a country (IN) with laws allowing free speech is getting really manipulated by some multinational corporations. Everyone should ditch Google. I have started de-googling my devices.

This has been a personal journey for me which kinda changed my life as it made me realize how much data is being collected on a stock android device!</p> <p>I have rooted my phone and installed microg. I nuked all google apps and services and I only installed gmail and maps cuz they are a necessary evil for me. </p> <p>But I am very much satisfied and have a peace of mind that now I don&#39;t have google play services (also known as google&#39;s rootkit) constantly running in the background and spying on me!</p> <p>I know some people hate the idea of using microg as they might prefer using a custom ROM without any goolag. But I have to use gmail cuz my gmail account is linked to my bank and university and I can&#39;t change them. Maps are important for me because open street maps covera
