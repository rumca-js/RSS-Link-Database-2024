## PCVR and Standalone Meta Quest 3

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I have a kind of random question. I am going to get a Quest 3 soon, and was wanting to get some games. If I want to get a game, for example Beat Saber, do I have to choose PCVR or standalone? What I mean is, if I am at home, can I play Beat Saber running on my PC for better graphics, but then when I am not at home, I have the Quest run it but I only buy the game once? Is there a way to do that? Or if I want to do that, do I have to get the game on both the Meta Quest store and on SteamVR?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Illustrious-Ebb5144"> /u/Illustrious-Ebb5144 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1hrf9kj/pcvr_and_standalone_meta_quest_3/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1hrf9kj/pcvr_and_standalone_meta_quest_3/">[comments]</a></span>

It gets a bit better when I turn down the resolution, but I don&#39;t think I should have to do that with a 4070. Has anybody else experienced this? Is there a solution? I haven&#39;t found any posts about it. I&#39;m on Q3 via link cable, running the game through SteamVR with OpenXR.

The DFR really doesn’t do much for me in MSFS.

However i find that im not the type of person to play many of the non AAA games on it, and the fact that PSVR has AAA titles is a huge plus for me. Im looking for feedback form this sub given current price points and because i find many of the videos on youtube to be sponsored or price point biased given that PSVR2 was very expensive at release.

I have no concerns with the ethical ramifications of what I&#39;m doing, my only concern is with what the hardware of the average player&#39;s VR setup is capable of. I want to damage the eyesight of my players on purpose and just need to know what the usual headsets are able to output in terms of that is. The kind of responses I&#39;m looking for follow the form of &quot;I have XYZ headset and, in my experience of staring directly into many a virtual sun, have only been able to apply subtly annoying glare to my eyes&quot; but information in any form is appreciated.</p> <p>I have not done enough VRing to have much of a reference point for how bright these can be and I refuse to test this on myself due to mentioned eye damage.</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Lemon_Lord1"> /u/Lemon_Lord1 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.co
