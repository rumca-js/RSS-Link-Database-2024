Researchers have come up with a new way to identify more infectious variants of viruses or bacteria that start spreading in humans -- including those causing flu, COVID, whooping cough and tuberculosis.

## Key players in brain aging: New research identifies age-related damage on a cellular level

Scientists have identified the molecular changes that occur in the brains of aging mice and located a hot spot where much of that damage is centralized. The cells in the area are also connected with metabolism, suggesting a connection between diet and brain health.

## A tour de force: Engineers discover new 'all-optical' nanoscale sensors of force
 - [https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/01/250101132015.htm](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/01/250101132015.htm)

Researchers report that they have invented new nanoscale sensors of force. They are luminescent nanocrystals that can change intensity and/or color when you push or pull on them. These 'all-optical' nanosensors are probed with light only and therefore allow for fully remote read-outs -- no wires or connections are needed.

## Ancient DNA unlocks new understanding of migrations in the first millennium AD

Waves of human migration across Europe during the first millennium AD have been revealed using a more precise method of analysing ancestry with ancient DNA, in research led by the Francis Crick Institute.

## Scientists pin down the origins of a fast radio burst

Astronomers pinned down the origins of at least one fast radio burst, a brief and brilliant explosion of radio waves emitted by an extremely compact object. The team's novel technique might also reveal the sources of other FRBs.
