A 12,000-year-old wolf leg bone discovered at the Swan Point archaeological site in Alaska has provided new insights into early human-wolf interactions. DNA analysis confirmed the animal was related to wolves, while chemical isotope testing showed it had a diet rich in salmon, suggesting possible human involvement. Researchers debate whether this animal was intentionally fed by humans or simply scavenged their food. These findings contribute to the ongoing discussion about the domestication of dogs, with experts divided on the implications. Some see it as evidence of early domestication, while others propose the "trash heap hypothesis," where wolves adapted to human food waste. This discovery adds a new layer to understanding the human-animal bond in prehistoric times

A recent biodiversity survey in Peru’s Alto Mayo region led to the discovery of 27 new species, including a unique blob-headed bristlemouth armored catfish. The survey, conducted by Conservation International, uncovered new mammals, amphibians, fish, butterflies, and plants, emphasizing the area’s ecological importance. Researchers used innovative techniques like environmental DNA and camera traps to document species, some of which are potentially new to science. The findings highlight the need for sustainable conservation efforts in the region to protect its rich biodiversity, especially in areas influenced by human activity

Princeton University researchers have developed a new 3D printed plastic material that is stretchable, flexible, and recyclable. Using thermoplastic elastomers and thermal annealing, the material can be tailored to different mechanical properties, making it suitable for applications in soft robotics, medical devices, prosthetics, and more. The cost-effective and scalable technique also allows for self-healing, offering a sustainable solution for industries in need of adaptable materials

## Could We Ever Retrieve Memories from a Dead Person's Brain? Neuroscientists Weigh In

Neuroscientists are exploring whether memories can be retrieved from a deceased person’s brain, but current research indicates significant challenges. Memories are thought to be stored in the brain as engrams, which are formed by groups of neurons in the hippocampus and other regions. While some studies have identified these engrams in animals, replicating this in humans is complex due to the dispersed nature of memory storage and the reconstructive nature of human memory. Experts suggest that even if memories could be theoretically mapped, recreating them accurately would be extremely difficult. For now, the retrieval of memories from a dead person remains beyond our technological capabilities, and memories likely fade with the individual who experienced them
