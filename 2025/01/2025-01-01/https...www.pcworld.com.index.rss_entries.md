<p>Virtual private networks, or VPNs, are one of the most effective ways to keep your data private and secure while online. They encrypt and hide our confidential web activity and are a key component in helping us to navigate safely while connected to the internet.</p>

<p>I’ve been reviewing monitors for almost 20 years, so believe me when I say this: 2025 will be the best year to buy a new monitor, ever.</p>



<p>Today’s most attractive and feature-rich monitors command high prices compared to what was typical a decade ago, which has moved some monitor shoppers up-market. In turn, this has given monitor makers an incentive to pursue new trends in panel technology, video inputs, and image processing, among other features.</p>



<p>Also, the growing proliferation of OLED is a huge boon for monitors, and not just because OLED looks great and delivers smooth motion. While pricing on high-end, cutting-edge monitors is still up, pricing on monitors with OLED panels is edging towards a freefall.</p>

Now, it’s becoming par for the home security course. </p>



<p>Just as it has in the general technology space, generative AI has begun to permeate the smart home and home security markets, from smart cams that can augment their video histories with self-generated captions to smart lights capable of creating lighting scenes using natural-language prompts. </p>



<p>The trend of AI in the smart home will be everywhere at this year’s edition of CES, where many–if not most–smart home and home security announcements will come with a generous sprinkling of LLM-powered
