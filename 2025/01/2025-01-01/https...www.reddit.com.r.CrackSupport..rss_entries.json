Do I need to use both steam and Xbox account for forza motorsport or only a fake steam account? And how to even create this fake account, log in and avoid bans? Can I run the game from the default setup exe or I have to run it from online fix setup everytime? And whenever a new update rolls, I won&#39;t be able to play until elamigos upload new update contents and just install it on game files?
