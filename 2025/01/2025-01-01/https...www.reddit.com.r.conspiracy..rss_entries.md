As the title says, everyone I know has gotten sick in the past two weeks, including myself. What I think is the weirdest part about it all is that everyone I&#39;ve talked, local and nationwide, has had the EXACT same symptoms as I did. My illness started out with a sore throat and fatigue in the afternoon. The next morning, I woke up feeling lethargic and had symptoms of an upper respiratory illness (runny nose, swollen sinuses, and slight body aches). Those symptoms persisted for a few days with a variable intensity. On day 3, I felt fine, and day 4 felt like day 2 again. Even with swollen sinuses, I could breathe through both nostrils the whole time, which is unusual, especially with the (large) amount of mucus I was expelling. So what do you guys think? Did anyone else who was exposed to the fog have these sym
