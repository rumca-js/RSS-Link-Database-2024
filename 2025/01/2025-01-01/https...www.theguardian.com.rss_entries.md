<ul><li>Littler’s 5-2 win sets up semi-final with Stephen Bunting</li><li>‘The crowd wanted a comeback, I just wanted to finish it’</li></ul><p>Nathan Aspinall probably thinks he just took part in a game of darts. And look, his name was definitely on the scoreboard, and you may have glimpsed him on your television grinning away in the background, and in a few days’ time there will be a hefty bank transfer from the Professional Darts Corporation confirming he did, indeed, participate.</p><p>But while Aspinall may have been here corporeally, in a very real sense he wasn’t actually here at all. He was essentially a tower of pixels, a ­mannequin, an uncredited extra, the silent letter in the middle of a word. He was one of those characters in a noughties video game who walks into a wall and disappears. He was the latest player to stand between Luke Littler and world domination, and <em>that</em> turned out exactly the way you might expect.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2

## Sunderland close in on leaders after Isidor strike sees off Sheffield United

<p>Wilson Isidor, Jobe Bellingham and the rest of Régis Le Bris’s vibrant young side are not about to give up on automatic promotion quite yet. This statement victory, secured thanks to Isidor’s fine winning goal, not merely preserved Sunderland’s unbeaten home record in the Championship this season but kept them fourth, only two points and one place behind a suddenly mortal-looking Sheffield United.</p><p>Three games without a win has left Chris Wilder’s team three points in arrears of the leaders, Leeds and trailing second-place Burnley on goal difference. Given that the round trip from Bramall Lane to the Stadium of Light is 260 miles by road, an 8pm kick-off on a public holiday coinciding with a wholesale public transport shutdown in the north-east was probably not the brightest of ideas.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jan/01/sunderland-sheffield-united-championship-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Steven Knight’s cool-as-hell second world war drama is back – and it’s still an utterly thrilling romp of a watch. Charge on!</p><p>Man down! Steven Knight’s crackerjack dramatisation of the formation and second world war exploits of the Special Air Service returns with a snag to fix. In season one, this new elite British army regiment, and the show commemorating it, were led by Connor Swindells as David Stirling, an officer with an intoxicating blend of debonair dash and suppressed rage. But SAS: Rogue Heroes is based on fact, albeit in a scatter-gun, tie askew, stolen-your-wife sort of way, and the fact is that in January 1943, Stirling became a prisoner of war in Italy. Season two begins in the spring and summer of that year, so Stirling is duly confined and Swindells, the star, is hardly in it.</p><p>Taking command now is Jack O’Connell as Paddy Mayne, previously the screaming id to Stirling’s smart ego. Can he hack it on his own? The success of the operation depends on him …

<p>The ludicrously camp Claudia Winkleman hit returns with a gutting twist in the opening moments – and some wild new rules. Prepare for emotional disembowelment all the way! </p><p>Series three of The Traitors begins with an utterly gutting twist. Well, technically it begins with Claudia Winkleman opening a drawer of identical pairs of red fingerless leather gloves while conversing with an owl (yes, the show’s ludicrously camp Highland gothic vibe is still in full swing), but after that it’s emotional disembowelment all the way.</p><p>As per tradition, a new cohort of players meet on a steam train, where they merrily bond. Unlike previous series, however, this journey is a test: there are 25 passengers on board, announces Winkleman over the public address system as the train slows to a standstill, but only room for 22 contestants on the show itself: each of the three carriages must eject one person or lose up to £10,000 from the prize fund.

<p>Mikel Arteta wanted to send a warning to Liverpool that Arsenal can push them all the way for the Premier League title and this was evidence that they mean business. Facing a Brentford side boasting the division’s best home record and trailing to an early Bryan Mbeumo strike, Arsenal hit back with goals from Gabriel Jesus – his sixth in his past four games – Mikel Merino and Gabriel Martinelli to ensure that they moved to within six points of Arne Slot’s side, albeit from one game more.</p><p>It was far from a perfect performance from Arsenal that once again needed a goal from a corner – their 10th of the season – to settle their nerves. But having now gone 11 matches in all competitions without defeat and with the 17-year-old Ethan Nwaneri making another big impression on his first Premier League start, Arteta will sense that their momentum is slowly building.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jan/01/brentford-arsenal-premier-league-match-report">Continue rea

I approach each new adaptation of a Harlan Coben thriller under his 14-book deal with Netflix as a weary traveller on a very long journey – committed to reaching the final destination and grateful every time that we are closer to the end.</p><p>It has been a funny old business, this deal. The adaptations have been churned out in a manner reminiscent of the old studio system – fast, efficiently and apparently with any actors free at the moment of casting and with little time to spare for making them stand up to great scrutiny. Or perhaps they are more like the Catherine Cookson dramas that flooded the 90s television schedules and whose formulaic pleasures can still be found when you are off sick, or otherwise in need of comfort (along with the chance to spot now-star actors in embryonic form).

<p>How do you reset your wardrobe for the new year? Our fashion guru reveals her hardworking heroes for January</p><p>The bar for shopping recommendations is high at this point of the year. No one has the appetite – or the funds – for shopping for the sake of it in January. Don’t know about you but, frankly, I never want to see another nick-nack. And having overindulged throughout the festive season, I have the sparkle equivalent of a hangover.

Investments in keeping your new year fitness resolutions are worth making because those are promises to yourself. Small treats are sometimes necessary to get you through the darkest days of winter. And, it’s never too early to look for the pieces that will shift your wardrobe into a 2025 vibe: the sooner you start wearing them, the more wear you get out of them. Here are my ver

<p>The Liberal Democrat leader’s summer of stunts ended in the party’s biggest electoral success ever – and managed to push social care up the agenda. His next project? Mastering TikTok</p><p>There he was, falling off a paddleboard, then zooming down a waterslide in a yellow rubber ring. He bungee-jumped, tried surfing, spent a day at a theme park, splashed around to Taylor Swift songs at aqua-aerobics and had a makeover on the TV show This Morning. Hooting with joy, usually with centrist dad bod wrestled into tight wetsuit, Ed Davey, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, became the politician wringing the most fun out of last summer’s general election. It shouldn’t have worked. At the previous election, the Lib Dems won just 11 seats, which put them on the critically endangered list (they added another four in byelections). Now, Davey is one of 72 Lib Dem MPs, the party’s biggest success in modern history, and a number that surprised even him.</p><p>Davey became famous as the man who

His move from Mercedes after 12 seasons and six titles was a huge shock and this new start could not be more gripping. How will he fare in a new team at the age of 40, a new culture at Maranello, a team that has a history of making and breaking drivers? Better still the prospect of him ending Ferrari’s drivers’ title drought that now stretches back to 2007 and in so doing claiming a record-breaking eighth world championship across three different teams. Or will it be a testing and turbulent opening year, far from his comfort zone?

<p>From weightlifting to woodland walks, Guardian readers and health experts share their tried-and-tested ways to keep burnout at bay</p><p>Overwhelm can come from multiple worries going round and round in our heads like a washing machine, which can deplete our energy. A helpful strategy is to set aside 10 to 15 minutes each day for “constructive worrying”, where you write down your concerns. You&nbsp;can then apply cognitive strategies such as “if, then” planning (“if X happens, I will do Y”) or assess worst-best-probable case scenarios. This process can help reduce the emotional intensity of worries and lessens overwhelm. Sometimes, you may just need to remind yourself to tackle <em>one</em> problem and <em>one</em> task at a time. <strong>Nick Hatter</strong><strong>, psychotherapeutic coach</strong><strong>, life coach and author of <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Questions-Ultimate-Self-Esteem-Potential-Transform/dp/0349428816">The&nbsp;7 Questions</a></strong></p> <a href="ht

<p>Today’s rumours are driving you to the door</p><p>Paracetamol. Check. Water. Check. Rumour Mill? Check! Welcome to 2025, eerily similar to the end of 2024, save for a new calendar on the kitchen wall and the opening of the January transfer window. Not only does that mean that ailing Manchester-based clubs will be able to sign new shiny players for extortionate prices, but also that players out of contract at the end of this season will also be able to arrange free transfers on the cheap (but with extortionate wages).</p><p>Among the latter is <strong>Cristiano Ronaldo</strong>, who is nearing the end of the record contract – total reported salary of €200m (£177m) per year once commercial agreements are included – that tempted him to Saudi Arabia two years ago. The Portuguese has previously stated that he wanted to win the Saudi title with Al-Nassr, something he has not yet achieved, but when pushed on his future last week he stated: “You never know what can happen in the future.”

<p>The actor stars in the much-celebrated sleeper hit. Now, she’s changing gears to tackle the compulsively twisty Harlan Coben adaptation Missing You</p><p>When Rosalind Eleazar got married last year on a Greek island, she asked her agents not to contact her about work. But the day after the wedding (which took place in a mini amphitheatre – “we are so extra”) she was “exceptionally hungover” when she got a call about a job: the lead in Netflix’s new Harlan Coben adaptation, Missing You. Eleazar immediately bought the book and, to the mild annoyance of her new husband, the Italian producer and director Gabriele Lo Giudice (“he wasn’t best pleased”), spent her honeymoon reading it. “Those final five pages – are you kidding me?” She shakes her head, wide-eyed. “I did not in my wildest dreams imagine that was where it was going.”</p><p>It is a fairly typical reaction to a Coben story.

<p>Based on a real mass killing, this 16th-century tale of backstabbing and beheadings is a clunker with a laddish edge</p><p>‘A great deal of this actually happened,” reads the title card at the start of this action-packed historical epic. Possibly. But it’s unlikely that anyone actually said these words. Like an episode of Game of Thrones scripted by Guy Ritchie, there is a laddish finesse to the dialogue in this 16th-century tale of backstabbing and beheadings. “That sounds like a load of bollocks,” splutters the Danish king Christian II to an adviser in one scene. The actors are mostly Danes and Swedes speaking lines in English, plus a few Brits with a slight Scandi tinge to their accents.</p><p>The film is based on real events: the mass killing of Swedish nobles in 1520, ordered by Danish king Christian II (Claes Bang). The script gives history a revisionist twist or two: namely by adding a pair of aristocratic Swedish sisters, beautiful Anne (Sophie Cookson) and skilled hunter
