I&#39;m using <a href="https://steamgriddb.github.io/steam-rom-manager/">Steam Rom Manager</a> to add the Cemu Roms to Steam, and that part works a treat, correctly scraping the games and everything. However, when I&#39;m trying to run those added games from Steam, nothing happens. I&#39;ve set the permissions for Steam to access the drive the Roms are on through Flatseal as well. How do I get Cemu and Steam to play nicely with each other? (It&#39;s probably an issue with both apps being Flatpaks, isn&#39;t it?)</p> <p>If anyone could help me with this I&#39;d be super grateful.

Linux is not only my go-to operating system for personal use but also a passion of mine in my IT career. I do a lot of web development, video editing, and various other tasks, and Linux handles those beautifully.</p> <p>However, Linux isn’t perfect for everything, which is why I’ve been using QEMU and Virt-Manager to run macOS and Windows virtual machines for tasks that require those operating systems. For the most part, this setup works wonderfully and keeps me from needing to dual boot... except when it comes to gaming.</p> <p>Initially, I passed through my single GPU to a Windows VM for gaming. While this setup <em>kind of</em> worked, I recently decided to go back to dual-booting Windows for gaming.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>As a Teacher, I know that most of my students don&#39;t have computers that can upgrade to Windows 11, so I thought I&#39;d take the plunge into Linux so I can give an informed idea for an alternative.</p> <p>In doing my research, and I have realized that: Steam Deck is based on Arch, and it seems Proton may be optimised for this (is this even true??). Bazzite is based on Fedora, but is a SteamOS clone and is racing up the charts; Mint is based on Ubuntu, and is suggested as one of the best Distros for new users, but it doesn&#39;t even rank on the &quot;Best Distro for Gaming&quot;.</p> <p>On all the posts I&#39;m reading, it seems to be a lot of people saying, &quot;I&#39;ve run mine for months without a problem and am enjoying it&quot;... I know that most people would enjoy their different distros, but I&#39;m hoping somone can give me a deeper understanding of why I would choose the different distro bases.. (ie, Ubuntu vs Arch vs Fedora vs ... )

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi there, I’ve been considering making a switch from windows to linux, just tired of updates and constant gloom surrounding it. One last thing i need to consider is how the state of Nvidia gpu support is on linux now. Everywhere i search i see people saying that Nvidia’s performance on linux is noticeably worse than on windows, though the news is either a few months or a year old. With no plans on buying a new gpu until this thing literally dies one day, I’d just like to get some insight about how the state of nvidia on linux is these days.</p> <p>Side note: my distro will most likely be mint or kubuntu. Ive distro hopped for a bit now and mint was the only one i ever got off the ground for a while, until the file system decided to break one day. Fedora kept having random hangs and freezes even with the rpm nvidia drivers installed..</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/stinkgum"> /u/stinkgum </a> <br

The launcher opens and I get the opening cut scene but when It said make fatshark account it just crashed and now just crashes once you get to the loading screen after the opening cutscene. I read online that this glitch gets fixed by deleting the dark tide folder in %appdata% but when I went to the steam simulated appdata folder and deleted it the bug still happened and then when I checked again the folder is back. I also disabled steam cloud to avoid it reloading a corrupted file like I saw on a post.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/EeriePoppet"> /u/EeriePoppet </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1hqrwal/warhammer_darktide_crash_on_start_up/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1hqrwal/warhammer_da

The lag is noticeable sometimes and the stream compression can be noticeable. </p> <p>Since I’ve been doing 80% of my PC gaming on the couch, I have been considering rebuilding my PC into a smaller form factor HTPC build. Why not get all of the power where I’m mostly playing?</p> <p>I’ve recently found bazzite and am seriously considering making an HTPC my powerful gaming PC, then getting a low powered mini PC to do game streaming. Mostly for when I’m playing games like Factorio or when I do prefer to sit at a desk.</p> <p>Does anyone run this configuration? I’m trying to weigh pros and cons before I make the jump. Another thing I’m trying to figure out is if I can turn on the gaming PC from sleep with an 8BitDo controller
