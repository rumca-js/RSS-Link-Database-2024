Beginning with C++11, there were new features introduced in both the language and Standard Library that proved to be highly beneficial for simulating stochastic processes and analyzing the results. In addition, the linear algebra library Eigen, comprised of template code, makes it simple to perform matrix and vector operations in C++. Using an application in colorectal cancer research, the presentation will feature three topics in C++, namely random number generation, parallel computing, and leveraging the Eigen library.\n\nOne of the main attractions of Eigen is that it simplifies the code implementation for people who think mathematically, as the + and * operators are clearly defined in the mathematical sense of matrix addition and row-by-column matrix multiplication.
