If I want to get a game, for example Beat Saber, do I have to choose PCVR or standalone? What I mean is, if I am at home, can I play Beat Saber running on my PC for better graphics, but then when I am not at home, I have the Quest run it but I only buy the game once? Is there a way to do that? Or if I want to do that, do I have to get the game on both the Meta Quest store and on SteamVR?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Illustrious-Ebb5144\"> /u/Illustrious-Ebb5144 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1hrf9kj/pcvr_and_standalone_meta_quest_3/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1hrf9kj/pcvr_and_standalone_meta_quest_3/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Im currently debating whether to get PSVR2 ($350) or Meta Quest 3 ($500). I am a PS5 owner. The fact that Meta Quest 3 is wireless is a huge plus for me. However i find that im not the type of person to play many of the non AAA games on it, and the fact that PSVR has AAA titles is a huge plus for me. Im looking for feedback form this sub given current price points and because i find many of the videos on youtube to be sponsored or price point biased given that PSVR2 was very expensive at release.

I&#39;m planning on buying another battery pack soon so I would have the luxury of playing for long period of time without stopping to charge. Now if I were to play with the battery pack connected until it gets low then swap with the other one and continue while the 1st battery is charging, rinse and repeat. Through it all the strap is plugged into the headset which means the headset battery is constantly charging while putting the headset to heavy use with gameplay wouldn&#39;t that damage the headset battery?
