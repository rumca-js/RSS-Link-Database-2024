The human thought that he was not allowed to drink with them because they looked down onto he fact that he was human, but it turns out it was because he became really strong and destructive when he was drunk. </p> <p>A few things I can remember about the anime from some of the clips I&#39;ve watched:</p> <ol> <li>It seems to have a comedic theme.</li> <li>The human protagonist is a male.</li> <li>The Demon Lord is also a male.</li> <li>The protagonist tried to resign from his position but did not succeed. </li> <li>Everyone seemed to know he was human (it was not a hidden thing)</li> </ol> <

## Who was your favorite VA performance of 2024?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Favorite performance doesn&#39;t have to mean best performance. It&#39;s about what personally impressed you or appealed to you for one reason or another. </p> <p>My favorite was Nina from Girls Band Cry. The VA was only around 14-15 years old at the time of recording with no prior experience(she was scouted as a singer). They gave her an overly emotional and complex character that needed a wide range and she was phenomenal, especially as a newbie. I loved the voice cracks during emotional scenes that reflected her age. </p> <p>I also enjoyed Kenshin in the series remake. I&#39;ve seen the original 90&#39;s series in both dub and sub, and the new VA fits the character better than ever IMO.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/marshmallow_sunshine"> /u/marshmallow_sunshine </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1hqvz9f/who_was_your_favorite_va_performance_of_2024/">[link]</a>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This anime was called something along the lines of &quot;Earth Defense Agency&quot; or &quot;Earth Defense Force&quot; but searching those wields nothing, there were robot people and an agency which fought against them, the robots had CGI(pretty bad cgi imo) and so did the suits of armor the agency used, the agency also adopted a boy which was an outcast, this boy found a white dog on a school trip which he shared a telepathic link with or something similar, there was a scene where the dog predicts a bridge collapsing and saves a car of a student from the boy&#39;s class, in the car there was a green cap(not sure about the color) and there was some focus on it, thank you alot for your help!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Leading-Tour-5212"> /u/Leading-Tour-5212 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1hqtj12/help_i_know_this_anime_i_watched_a_while_back_but/">[link]</a>
