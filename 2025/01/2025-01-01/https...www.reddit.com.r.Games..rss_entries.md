## Black Myth Wukong's game director blames the Xbox Series S 10GB of memory for the Xbox version being delayed

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Rough Translation</p> <p>&quot;Although there were no big surprises, I was still a little bit emotional after taking them all. Your combat capabilities are so terrifying, and the only thing missing is the XBOX robe... It seems a bit inappropriate (but the 10G shared memory, without several years of optimization experience, it is really difficult to use it) Can’t come down [tears]&quot;</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Hot-Cause-481"> /u/Hot-Cause-481 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://weibo.com/6603744955/P7ANY0vxd">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1hraser/black_myth_wukongs_game_director_blames_the_xbox/">[comments]</a></span>

## Epic Games' newest program "Launch Everywhere With Epic" is now live!
