## Looking for games with a difficulty setting that adds complexity rather than just tougher encounters.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s an example to clarify what I&#39;m looking for: Goldeneye 64 and its spiritual successor, Perfect Dark, had different difficulty levels that had you complete more and more objectives as you crank up the challenge. </p> <p>In the first mission of Goldeneye, Dam, you must reach the end by bungee jumping off a platform. If you go up a notch in difficulty, you now have to neutralize some alarms before jumping. If you pick the hardest difficulty, you have to do all of the above and also install a covert gadget and intercept some data flow.</p> <p>Are there any games that tried to do something similar? I know about Timesplitters, I believe it was made by some of the team that worked on the Rare FPS titles. I&#39;m really wondering if this is just something that was lost with time or if it&#39;s still something you see in modern games.</p> <p>Happy new year and thanks for reading.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https:/

And everything in between.</p> <p>My personal favourites are ONI and Stationeers. Complicated, in-depth survival with multiple levels that are never quite &#39;complete&#39;. The worst has to be Space Engineers. Great game for building stuff, but the survival is just &#39;&#39;at intervals, run to the Medical Machine and press F for few seconds, also remember to throw in ice once per year&#39;&#39;. </p> <p>Most exploration games just have &#39;&#39;eat, drink, breathe&#39;&#39; as the survival mechanics, and easy-to-gather resources for it. To me they (survival elements, not the games) feel like an extra chore in a game not really built for them. Mechanics like &#39;&#39;food needs correct environment and nutrients to grow&#39;&#39; and hygiene, and making it complicated to build instead of just plopping down one machine make the game feel more in-d

The city Razalia is based off of Seattle, one of my hometowns. And every year Seattle does a neat drone and firework show at the space needle. Which I wanted to emulate in Minecraft using shaders/rtx etc. I have done this multiple times in this city each year! </p> <p>Anyways! Happy New Years 2025.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’m trying to find a good game that mainly revolves around building a home/ settlement/ base. It can have survival mechanics but doesn’t require it. I prefer the building to not be annoying or difficult for no reason. Valheim for example, I really could not stand building in that game. Everything else about it was kindve what I’m looking for. I also prefer 3rd or first person, not top down. </p> <p>It’s hard to describe the kind of game I want but i like building up a place from nothing and progressing. </p> <p>Games I liked that did well in this aspect: </p> <p>Satisfactory</p> <p>Sons of the forest (really enjoyed how you build in this game) </p> <p>Minecraft</p> <p>Fallout 4</p> <p>Pal world </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/trashaccount1400"> /u/trashaccount1400 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1hqta3s/good_farming_survival_base_building_games/">[link]</a></sp
