<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I know you can&#39;t advertise on this Reddit but I wanted to talk about the situation @theemilygwen on Twitter is in. It breaks my heart that the creator of the lesbian flag is suffering. I feel like corporations are financially benefiting from her design while she has to beg online. Even if you do not like her lesbian flag, I personally adore it and am very thankful it got popular. </p> <p>I hope that people at least remember to credit her even if they cannot help her.</p> <p>Happy new year to the community. To those who are suffering, you are not alone and you are beautiful.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/sadappearance666"> /u/sadappearance666 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/1hrdl3r/the_creator_of_the_lesbian_flag_is_struggling/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/1hrdl3r/the_creator_of_the_lesbian_flag_is_struggling/
