We got it to the table once, at a player count of 4, and found it to be nice but not special enough to play it again soon. Today we were six and looking for a game that wouldn&#39;t take too long to setup, teach (to the new players) and play, so we chose to give Dune Betrayal another go.</p> <p>It was a success. There&#39;s a common point of criticism about this game stating it was all guessing and not enough information to make real deduction possible. This wasn&#39;t the case at all at 6 players (more so at 4). You have to pay attention to the cards people choose, and of course, there will have to be some table talk, but that&#39;s the case with any social deduction game. The unique scoring mechanism, the card actions and the combination of cards counting for score and action management make this unique enough to justify having it in addition to more common sd games (Res

I think it’s been a good year for games, with my own highlights being attending the UKGE at Birmingham and Aircon at Harrogate where I managed to demo a lot of good games . The ones that stick out are, TableTop Inc (formerly Meeple Inc because you can apparently trademark a Meeple…enough about that), this is one of my most anticipated games of 2025 from a great bunch of people at Cotswold games, I really hope it does well. We played World Order at UKGE and it was amazing, instantly recognisable as being part of the Hegenomy world but a distinctly different game and another one I’m looking forward to arriving in 2025. I also, as always accumulated more games for my shelf of opportunity, stand out titles being Salton Sea, Callisto 2200, Sand and Age of Comics.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been thinking about getting a 3D printer, mostly for inserts and other board game accessories. I&#39;m mostly thinking about the Bambu Labs A1 and A1 Mini. I&#39;ve checked a couple inserts in Bambu Studio and for the most part, everything fits even on the Mini&#39;s smaller build plate. What I&#39;m wondering is how much time and hassle the bigger build area of the A1 would save. Obviously the actual print times would be pretty much the same, but I could print more parts in one go, and I wouldn&#39;t have to cut up and glue together parts in case they don&#39;t fit the Mini. Right now I could get the Mini for 215€ and the A1 for 350€. The price difference is quite big but I don&#39;t want to run into a situation where I buy the Mini and then regret it and end up getting the A1 later anyway.

For context, the official board game rules of Stratego (and the ones I grew up with), state that when two pieces attack each other, they both reveal themselves. My friend grew up with rules where only the defending side reveals itself, and the attacker is honest about what they have and decides whether they win or lose (so they don&#39;t have to reveal their pieces).</p> <p>We are down to try both variants, but are trying to figure out which rule set should be the first to be played (a minute, but important point).</p> <p>My argument is that there&#39;s no way to tiebreak between the two of us which one should go first since we both like the rules we grew up with, and therefore the &quot;3rd vote&quot; tiebreaker here is the official rules of the game (and that I think its more fun).
