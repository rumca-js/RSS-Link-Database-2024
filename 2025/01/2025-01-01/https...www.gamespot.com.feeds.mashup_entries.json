        "description": "<p>One of the best feelings in a roguelike is when the pieces all come together to create a perfect run. In Hades it's a powerful combination of powers, in Dead Cells it's a perfect set of weapons, and in Balatro it's all about getting the right combination of Jokers. With the right set of Jokers, a run in Balatro can feel almost easy at times. You have so many Joker effects happening that the game starts to speed up the animations and your score catches on fire because you aren't about to just win the round--you are about to blow past it, making the score you need to reach seem trivial in the process.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">These runs are amazing in Balatro and in other roguelikes, but that's because it's not how every run goes. In fact, that's how very few runs usually go. Most runs in Balatro, including many of my winning runs, have me barely beating out each round with my final hand. Every shop or bonus for skipping a blind becomes deeply important, because I need another boost in chips",
