<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a complete noob at this. I&#39;m configuring a news server on NZBGet for altHUB. I&#39;m getting this error when testing the connection:</p> <pre><code>Connection to althub.co.za failed: Error 10060 - A connection attempt failed because the connected party did not properly respond after a period of time, or established connection failed because connected host has failed to respond. </code></pre> <p>Host = <a href="http://althub.co.za">althub.co.za</a></p> <p>My user credentials are correct and the port is at the default (119). The error tells me that the server does not respond in time. So the hostname could be incorrect?</p> <p>I checked the RSS information in the cart on althub but I&#39;m not getting any further and can&#39;t seem to find the info that I need to complete the config.</p> <p>What am I missing?</p> <p>Thank you.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/MartiniMini"> /u/MartiniMini

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have been using Fastusenet for 7 months now for 8gb files or smaller it just fine, When your downloading 20gb to 50gb files it is way to slow I am on a 1Gbit connection with FU I get 45mbps max. FU will download the file for like 10 seconds than pause for like 15 to 20 seconds then start again so downloading files really takes like 2 to 2.5 longer than it should take. IMO with FU I am getting more like 16mbs to 20mbs download speed. I am looking to switch to a much faster provider with unlimited downloads 5000+ days retention for like $6 to $9 a month which provider do you recommend.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Beavisguy"> /u/Beavisguy </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1hr1946/fastusenet_is_way_to_slow_any_other_providers/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1hr1946/fastusenet_is_way_to_slow_any_other_providers/">

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey guys,</p> <p>i signed up for Newshosting during their BF Deal by accident multiple times.

Just reply to this email, and we’ll gladly refund any additional charges on your account.</p> </blockquote> <p>i noticed my mistake 1 week ago when checking my credit card bill.</p> <p>wrote the Newshosting Support 5 days ago. still haven&#39;t heard back. </p> <p>having no problem waiting longer (its the holidays) just wanted to ask if that&#39;s normal or if there is a more efficient way to get in contact with newshosting? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/fn23452"> /u/fn23452 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1hqzgnh/newshosting_how_long_does_it_take_t
