I am doing everything with requests and want to avoid using a headless browser if possible. The captcha solving must be automatic (my app is a Discord bot and I don&#39;t want my users to have to solve captchas). I found an open source image recognition model on GitHub to solve Datadome captchas, but it means I have to use a headless browser... I don&#39;t think I can avoid captchas with better proxies or by simulating human behavior because there are a few routes on the website I scrape that always trigger a captcha, even if you already have a valid Datadome cookie (these r",

I was looking for a way to use my free X API to download a limited amount of tweets that contain a certain word with a Python code. I have installed tweepy and got the free API as I said, but it looks like my code always tells me I am doing too many researches (even though I try to set a minimum amount of keywords etc...). So, is there anyone to tell me how I can get tweets with my APIs and Python? :&#39;)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ksrio64\"> /u/ksrio64 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1hr63nq/scraping_tweets_by_keyword/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1hr63nq/scraping_tweets_by_keyword/\">[comments]</a></span>",
