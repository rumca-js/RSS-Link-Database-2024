The film was terrible as usual, but I’ve grown to enjoy his work in an ironically comedic way, so I do look forward to any future releases.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Just my opinion but I think that Scrooged 1988 is a better Christmas movie than Christmas Vacation 1989. Better - in that it is funnier, and Bill Murray&#39;s performance is better than Chevy Chase&#39;s. Mad respect to Christmas Vacation - it is definitely a top shelf classic, and a must watch every December. I love them both. But if I can only take 1 to a deserted island, I&#39;m taking Scrooged. It&#39;s dark, and hilarious. Bill brings a vulnerable transformation as Scrooge, and it&#39;s my personal favourite adaptation of A Christmas Carol. Also Carol Kane for the win.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So, why did I decide do this? Short answer: Twitch streamer Northernlion and Cine2Nerdle Battles, the former a movie trivia machine, and the latter a movie-trivia PVP game. Hoping some folks are familiar with both or either as explaining makes this giant post even bigger. Anyway, those got me to finally make a Letterboxd, and set me on a movie frenzy which peaked in early January. So I figured I&#39;d try and get through a year&#39;s worth. One a day was already kind of out the window as I started late, but 365 seemed surprisingly doable given the appetite I suddenly had for it (and sure enough I went over). There were so many classics I hadn&#39;t seen, recent beloved movies I didn&#39;t get to see in theatre, etc. Hilariously, I actually thought I&#39;d &quot;run out&quot; of the best stuff before the year was out, but of course that&#39;s patently absurd, especially with some of the choices I made.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>My New Year’s Eve movie was “Beau Is Afraid”. I am still trying to sort out in my mind what was real and what was a hallucination. Any thoughts? This movie is like “Inherent Vice”. Both have Joaquin Phoenix tripping out and both juxtapose reality and hallucination. I found it easier to separate the two in “Inherent Vice”. The noise complaint notes left in Beau’s apartment were probably a hallucination. As far as plot goes, did Grace and Roger’s daughter really commit suicide by drinking paint? The theater group commune was probably real but his placement in the plot was false. Did Beau kill his mom or did she die from a falling chandelier? I think the latter. Was the end a hallucination or judgment in the afterlife? Ari Aster sure makes some dark disturbing stuff. I thought “Midsommar” took the cake until I watched this one. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/thebradman70"> /u/thebradman70 </a> <br

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I’ve watched Bruce Almighty countless amount of times, especially when it first came out, I had it on DVD. Now that time has passed I’ve watched it a handful of times since and noticed, during the Niagara Falls scene where he goes live for the first time, he gets frustrated at the news of Evan being the new news anchor, during, at the end, he ends his segment with, “back to you f****ers” in which I KNOW he held a middle finger up as response. However, everywhere I have watched it (the past few years) he is only holding a fist. Does ANYBODY recall this? I’ve googled for screenshots or anything of the scene to verify and cannot anywhere find it. Did I stumble across another Mandela effect in the world from where we switched our reality’s/timelines?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/itzBenjaminz"> /u/itzBenjaminz </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hr3enh/bruce_almig

I&#39;m rewatching it tonight and even though I&#39;ve seen this movie five or six times this year - this part of the movie still makes me so hype.
