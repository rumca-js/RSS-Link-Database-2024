        "description": "The Sniper Elite franchise is a shining example of how an AA IP can carve out a strong audience for itself through sheer quality and consistency, and it\u2019s soon set to return with another outing in the form of Sniper Elite: Resistance. \n\nBilled as a standalone spinoff building off of 2022\u2019s excellent Sniper Elite 5, Resistance is being touted by developer Rebellion as yet another packed, full-fledged stealth sandbox offering, and based on everything that we have seen of it so far (which is quite a lot), it certainly looks well positioned to live up to that promise, even if it doesn\u2019t seem too willing to shake up the series\u2019 tried and tested formula. \n\nHere, we talk about why Sniper Elite: Resistance is a game we\u2019re keenly keeping an eye on.",
