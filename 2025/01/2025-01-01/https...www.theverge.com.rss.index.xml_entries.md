  <p id="sOLL2F">A Tesla Cybertruck appeared to explode outside of the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada on Wednesday morning. A <a href="https://x.com/kaaaassuu/status/1874506594425381133">video shared on X</a> shows the truck engulfed in flames just outside the hotel’s lobby, with the person who captured it saying the Cybertruck “blew up.”</p>

  <p id="co9eHm">The US has issued sanctions on organizations in Russia and Iran for attempting to interfere with the 2024 presidential election.
