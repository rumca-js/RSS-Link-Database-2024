<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello Community!</p> <p>I&#39;ve been working on a travel organization application for the past few months. I had tried a few subscription based services for personal travel but found their approach rather pushy and sometimes rather hostile. So I decided to make one myself. It&#39;s designed/intended to be self-hosted and at a point where I&#39;m happy using it myself. </p> <p>Alright, so the spiel:</p> <p>Surmai is a personal/family travel organizer. The app is built to solve 3 particular challenges while planning a trip:</p> <ol> <li>Allow collaborative planning between multiple people.</li> <li>Allow easy access to all the necessary artifacts during the course of the trip.</li> <li>Keep the data private.</li> </ol> <p>NOTE: This is a very very alpha stage project and under active development. Please report any issues using Github Issues.</p> <p>Github: <a href="https://github.com/rohitkumbhar/surmai">https://github.com/rohitkumbhar/surmai</a></p>

For some time I wanted to check what requests various devices on my network are making. I looked into possible options, but tbh my networking knowledge is lacking.</p> <p>Initial plan was to accept DNS requests on the rpi (as already is), route them to the monitoring container, collect data and then reroute to pihole for filtering. First I tried Zabbix, but struggled enormously with the set up. Out of frustration I put that on hold and switched to ntopng. While I did start it up successfully, it didn&#39;t seem to accept the incoming traffic nor to collect data.</p> <p>So my question is: is it even a viable plan to have two containers on the same host machine with one accepting traffic, collecting some data (currently I&#39;m only interested in what requests a device is making, size of traffic would be a &#39;nice to have&#39;) and then rerouting it

My first Reddit post ever is here to ask for advice for my project. For 1-2 month I&#39;ve been scrolling around the concept of self-hosted server (homelab no vps). This world is vertiginous for me.

However, I am thinking of building a self-hosting Plex stack and running a couple of containers on it. I tried to start those containers on the Pi, but at some point, the Pi started to be very slow to respond, and I am afraid that I am pushing its limits.</p> <p>I found this ThinkCentre SFF second-hand relatively cheap. I thought it would be a good and more powerful replacement for the Pi, and I should be able to use it for HEVC HW transcoding on the Plex as well. I guess I won&#39;t have any problems running all the containers I want on it as well, and I would be able to attach a couple of HDDs. My main concerns are:</p> <ul> <li>power consumption. Since this would run mostly idle, naturally I would like to lower the power consumption to the bare minimum.</li> <li>The CPU doesn&#39;t support ECC
