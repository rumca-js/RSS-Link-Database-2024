<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello!</p> <p>Recently got into self hosting after being introduced by a friend. Currently running some services via docker on a Beelink S12 Mini Pro (N100 CPU) - mainly an arr-stack with gluetun vpn + qbittorrent, jellyfin for media streaming etc. Looking to add some more containers in the future like a pi-hole, the whole reverse proxy, domain stuff (not really sure atm). </p> <p>Currently I have an external 2TB HDD plugged into the pc serving all my media and seeding/downloading from it 24/7. Thus my question if I should just upgrade this HDD to a larger storage one or invest in a NAS? Not mainly a storage problem but more of a question of longetivity and and realiabilty as I am not sure if having an external HDD plugged in/working all the time is a good idea (?). </p> <p>I&#39;d be happy to invest in a 2 bay NAS perhaps instead or something like an Aoostar R1 (N100) and replace my mini pc with that instead as it is still within its return period,

It’s a Rust based podcast management system that manages podcasts with multi-user support and relies on a central database with clients to connect to it.

There’s installable clients on just about every platform - now including a beta build of an Android client! (Also a flatpak, aur, Mac, windows, deb, appimage, and rpm client as well)</p> <p>Over time this project has really grown into something great, and many quality of life features have been baked in. The experience of using Pinepods at this point is getting close to some of the larger self-hosted projects such as Immich, and as feature complete as a client such as AntenaPods.

In order to get remote access I configured vpn with Tailscale. My question is: how do you face with the fact that Tailscale introduces different ip for the server. I mean, I could configure app with ip from Tailscale and remote access is guaranteed but it would not connect to local network (different ip).

All of my services are setup, SSL&#39;d, reachable by a domain name via Ngnix Proxy Manager (internal only), I have pihole setup as the local DNS server, and I have Tailscale working to access services from outside the network. </p> <p>Right now, only accessible by IP address. I&#39;m trying to enable the proxy hosts / subdomains from NPM while connected to tailscale. I&#39;ve read guides and as far as I can tell have everything setup correctly, but the domain won&#39;t resolve. These are the settings I&#39;m using on the Tailscale side: </p> <p>All devices have a tailscale client installed. NPM and the DNS server are on different hosts, and I wonder if that is the source of my problem, but not sure. </p> <ul> <li>The DNS server is an exit node, has routing enabled, and the accept-dns=false flag. </li> <li>The advertised routes are 192.168.1.0/24 (all of my services are wit

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone,</p> <p>I’ve seen Apache Airflow mentioned a few times here and decided to check it out, but I’m struggling to understand what it’s actually for.</p> <p>From what I can see, it’s a tool to schedule and manage workflows, but isn’t that something we can already handle with Linux tools like cron jobs and scripts? For example, I can write a script, schedule it with cron, and even use tools like Healthchecks to monitor whether it’s working correctly.</p> <p>So, what’s the benefit of using Airflow over this simpler setup? Are there specific scenarios where Airflow is the better tool, or am I missing something?</p> <p>Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/CalligrapherSad3189"> /u/CalligrapherSad3189 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1hkfr9c/apache_airflow_whats_the_point/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https:/
