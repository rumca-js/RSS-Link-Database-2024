<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Have always liked the Games Workshop stuff and put about 150 hours into Talisman (after putting enough hours into the tabletop version about 30 years ago; but this was before Mac abandoned 32 bit support and Nomad have no reason to change that as Devs) and also played through Dawn of War 2 and the Chaos Rising update of it. In short if I&#39;m going to pick up something off of Steam or wherever in the near future - are there any recommendations of fun plays? I have a preference towards 40K but unless a Space Marine 2 port comes around (which is frustrating as apparently it runs fine with workarounds even though it wasn&#39;t ported to Mac) the choice looks like Total Warhammer 3? Rogue Trader looks a bit slow for more liking which would have been my other choice. I&#39;m grateful for any suggestions or ideas here.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/iamezekiel1_14"> /u/iamezekiel1_14 </a> <br/> <span
