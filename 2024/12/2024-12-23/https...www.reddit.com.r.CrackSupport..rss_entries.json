Someone wrote that the solution is to move mods and check which one causes the conflict. The person who posted this said that the mod was the problem. Unfortunately, I didn&#39;t get an answer what mod it is and I have over 4k of them in the game...

I saw that I could try checking the direct 9 box in the game so I did and reloading but it didn\u2019t work. I then assumed I had the wrong version of reshade so I went and updated it to the latest version. Installed it with DX9 and loaded the game but it still didn\u2019t show up. I unchecked the Direct 9 box in game and installed reshade but with DX11 this time but still the menu didn\u2019t show up. I\u2019ve been playing around now for a while but each of my attempts to solve this have failed. The reshade menu won\u2019t show up anymore.

Not everyone was affected so it was hard to pinpoint the culprit.
