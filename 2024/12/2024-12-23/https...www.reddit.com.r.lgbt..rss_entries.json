I have been too cowardly to confront him and definitely won\u2019t be able to say it out loud.</p> <p>So I thought of a plan: instead of confronting him directly I reply\u201cthat\u2019s gay\u201d next time he posts good news, since the other meaning of the word is (at least was) happy. Then if he asks why I would call good news gay I can say because gay means happy and shouldn\u2019t be used to mean bad things.</p> <p>I know I should just stand up, but I can\u2019t. So is it okay for me to say this?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/PandaStudio1413\"> /u/PandaStudio1413 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/1hkf12j/is_it_okay_to_say_this/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/1hkf12j/is_it_okay_to_say_this/\">[comments]</a></span>",

My uncle is what I would call flamboyant in his actions and mannerisms, his voice is much like a stereotypical gay man\u2019s inflection. He\u2019s also very awkward with affection and touch.
