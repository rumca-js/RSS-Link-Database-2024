<p>USB Type-C is the most flexible connection for notebooks and smartphones. The most important of its many capabilities is as a charging socket for battery-powered devices. USB-C <em>should</em> finally make everything simple: One socket, one cable, one power supply for all devices – from computers to smartphones and tablets to headphones and other peripherals.</p>



<p>So much for the theory, which always sounds simple with USB. The reality is more confusing.</p>



<p>Not every USB-C power supply is suitable for every device. Not all Type-C ports can be used to charge devices quickly or at all. And not every Type-C cable ensures reliable power transmission. </p>



<p>This guide will give you an overview of the technical possibilities of Type-C charging and recommends suitable power supply units for all devices. If you’d like to avoid all the background a

<p>I’ve been writing these roundups for seven years running and in that time integrated graphics have gotten a lot more powerful. Just look at the Steam Deck and its many imitators: it’s the most popular gaming PC on the market by far, and it’s running off a laptop chip from several years ago. The upshot is you’ve got more choices than ever for games on a low-power PC.</p>



<p>Even so, I’ve picked ten fantastic new PC games that’ll run on a toaster, so long as you can find a toaster that’ll run Windows (or SteamOS). And it sure doesn’t hurt that they’re a lot cheaper than AAA games, too — the better to make the most out of any Steam gift cards you have laying around. </p>



<p>Here are my picks, in no particular order. If you’re looking for even more low-power games that’ll run on laptops, mini PCs, or older desktops, check out <a href="https://www.pcworld

<p>The days of walling off the outside world to protect your network are quickly going the way of the Dodo. Thanks to the extraordinary growth of remote workforces, the adoption of cloud-based networking, and new cyber threats, the old network security model just no longer works.</p>



<p>In this time of ultimate shareability and interconnectedness, threats can come from any angle—including inside your network. Enter the Zero Trust security framework. By trusting none and verifying all, Zero Trust can make any network, home of business, become Fort Knox.</p>



<p>With the old “castle and moat” style of protecting networks going by the wayside, many speculate that VPNs will follow suit. So what does this all mean for the security of your data and will you still be using a VPN in a few years time? Let’s dig in to find out more and see what the future holds fo
