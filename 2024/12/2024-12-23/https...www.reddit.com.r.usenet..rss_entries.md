<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey there, I just wanted to drop by to say I totally get people touting Usenet now. </p> <p>Gave it a shot (Arr-stack+newsdemon+nzbgeek). It&#39;s FAST. I can saturate my network bandwidth, which is just mind-blowing coming from the torrenting croud where sometimes things are crawling at &lt;1MB speed. </p> <p>The only issue I have responded so far is that it wasn&#39;t able to get some older content. So what&#39;s the best strategy here for someone with limited dollars. Multiple low cost providers and/or indexers? Or shell out for fancier services?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ShinyAnkleBalls"> /u/ShinyAnkleBalls </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1hkno7h/coming_over_from_torrenting/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1hkno7h/coming_over_from_torrenting/">[comments]</a></span>

I run a variety of services on it and it runs a great for everything I want it to do…with the exception of my SABNZB container. I often download large (60GB+ 4K remuxes and unfortunately when they need to be uncompressed, verified or repaired this spikes my CPU temperature to 85C + causing the fans to spin up and frankly be way too loud for an extended period of time. I have tried many things such as adjusting fan curves, installing a new Noctua cooler, pinning the sabnzb container to only use 2 cores but nothing seems to work. </p> <p>I don’t care how long the verify/repair process takes - I wish there was some way to set this task to be Lowe priority so that it doesn’t heat up my CPU as much. </p> <p>Other things I am considering are to use a secondary system such as a M4 Mac Mini running the SABNZB container through docker but I’d rather try to explore other options first in case there is a softw
