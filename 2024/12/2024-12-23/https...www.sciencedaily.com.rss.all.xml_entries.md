Researchers have created a platform, called SIMPL2, that revolutionizes the study of protein-protein interactions by simplifying detection while improving measurement accuracy. While protein-protein interactions have previously been considered 'undruggable' using small molecules, the platform addresses this challenge by facilitating the measurement of these interactions -- improving our understanding of the types of molecules needed to control them.

## New research identifies key cellular mechanism driving Alzheimer's disease

Researchers have unveiled a critical mechanism that links cellular stress in the brain to the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The study highlights microglia, the brain's primary immune cells, as central players in both the protective and harmful responses associated with the disease.

## Adoption of 'hospital-at-home' programs remains concentrated among larger, urban, not-for-profit and academic hospitals

A choice was made to include each word in this sentence. Every message, even the most mundane, is crafted with a specific frame in mind that impacts how the message is perceived. The study of framing effects is a multidisciplinary line of research that investigates when, how, and why language influences those who receive a message and how it impacts their response.
