Learn how to create a Christmas calendar with JavaScript and HTML canvas. You will create 25 different "Christmasy" icons. You will learn about coordinates, basic math, and programming techniques. This course is a great way to dive into modularity, reusability, and writing consistent code.

You can even submit your own versions for Radu to showcase at the end of this year.
