<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>A few months ago, I came across this amazing streaming site—it had no ads and a sleek purple-themed UI. You could stream everything in 4K with absolutely no lag, unlike most other sites that lag even with good internet because they all use the same servers. I didn’t lose track of it, but I forgot the link.</p> <p>Recently, I found something similar—not the same, but close. It doesn’t have 4K, and it does have some ads, but the key thing is it has zero lag, which is honestly a game-changer. The site is called sflix2.to</p> <p>Also, if anyone knows the site I’m referring to—the purple-themed one without ads—please send me a private message with the name. I’m pretty sure it had a basic name, something like movies.com or something easy to remember.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/fadeee16"> /u/fadeee16 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1hkr6gp/i_found_the_best_movie_s

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>been using links for almost 10 years and had an extremely positive experience until now. but nothing loads anymore and i’m about to give up on watching stuff because it’s more trouble than it’s worth</p> <p>every streaming site i use primarily uses upcloud and vidcloud for servers. when i try to watch something, it takes a few minutes to initially load and then it will buffer very frequently before it inevitably fails and automatically switches to vidcloud. vidcloud will run for probably less than a minute before giving me the error message “This video file cannot be played. (Error Code: 233001)”</p> <p>scenarios are identical on firefox and chrome. i use ublock origin as my adblocker if that makes a difference. </p> <p>is there something i’m missing? literally everything was perfect until a few weeks ago</p> <p>edit: forgot to mention that games run flawlessly on my wifi. i have download speeds of 380 Mbps</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by
