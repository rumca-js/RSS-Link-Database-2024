<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have around 8 years mostly as a cloud security engineer, most of my jobs have been cloud governance, IAM stuff, preventative/detective/etc. controls. But I realized that I really don&#39;t have a full grasp on how a lot of attackers work, which is a big chunk of CyberSec in general. </p> <p>For my own personal and career growth I want to understand these things more from a pen-testing perspective, even though I won&#39;t be a pen tester. For example I still have to lookup how XSS works, CSRF, SSRF, etc. I just never really interact with it.</p> <p>Can anyone recommend me a good course that might fit my bill? I&#39;m not a novice, I don&#39;t need a course that talks about what subnet is. I also don&#39;t care about certs at all, and think the OSCP might be too involved. I primarily deal with on a day-to-day web apps, cloud infrastructure running on Linux, not much AD or Windows stuff at all.</p> <p>Suggestions? Currently I&#39;m just reading the OW

## Could our search history from google or FB ever leak? Or our Messenger or IG messages?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I wonder if it could the same ways other leaks do. We had leaks of passwords multiple multiple times but the only leak of search history was by AOL and it was the company who did it. If I am wrong correct me and the post will be edited. That&#39;s what I read online.</p> <p>Why do we see passwords leaks, phone number leaks, but never search history leaks or messages leaks? Can it ever happen? Do you think it will and can we protect ourselves from it? In other ways than using safe browsers and apps to message, I didn&#39;t always and became worried because obviously I would not want my information be avaible for everyone.</p> <p>Google, FB, sell our data to other places. Could those companies leak it too? I would guess google and fb have good security measures but smaller companies may not.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Delicious_Fig_8400"> /u/Delicious_Fig_8400 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https:/
