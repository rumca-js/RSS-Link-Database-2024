But these kind of posts appear to be banned (I can see why that is needed) and relegated to a weakly thread where most requests go unanswered. So therefore I&#39;m asking a broader question. How would you advice someone with relatively little knowledge of AI, and limited time to learn more, to research what kind of services could be of use to them? I&#39;ve tried ChatGPT but not much else. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Holmbone\"> /u/Holmbone </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1hklcnw/how_to_choose_ai_tl/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1hklcnw/how_to_choose_ai_tl/\">[comments]</a></span>",
