<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Lost in a sea of great albums like UNKLE, Portishead,...</p> <p>Skinny first effort( out of two, I think) is a themed album about going out. It’s a very simple little vignette of life of a young man that goes out to have an escape from his failures (see failure, kind of an english answer to Beck&#39;s Loser) and maybe find love. The bus ride to the club, the plug( Mr.GoodStuff). The mix of Electro and more pop/folk songs. It&#39;s pretty much view into what was clubbing in the late 90&#39;s to early 2000&#39;s. It&#39;s been one of those records, I will enjoy putting on. I remember making tapes for friends and in general it was pretty well received by all of them.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/External-Bank-6859"> /u/External-Bank-6859 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1hkr54a/often_read_about_deep_cuts_what_about_skinnysthe/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a hre
