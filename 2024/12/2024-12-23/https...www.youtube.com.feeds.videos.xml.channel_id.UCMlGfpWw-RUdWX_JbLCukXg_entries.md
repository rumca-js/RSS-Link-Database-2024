Techniques to Optimise Multithreaded Data Building During C++ Game Development - Dominik Grabiec - CppCon 2024
---

In game development the building and optimisation of data for the game is an important but resource intensive and time consuming process. In this talk I will describe techniques used to improve the performance and efficiency of a data build system that was developed as part of a AAA game project.

I will briefly describe the differences between how the game code and data building code operate, how those differences impact processing performance, how a profiler can be used to identify trouble spots, and describe techniques I used to parallel data processing system performance.

While this is coming from a game development perspective the techniques can be applied to any task based parallel data processing system.
