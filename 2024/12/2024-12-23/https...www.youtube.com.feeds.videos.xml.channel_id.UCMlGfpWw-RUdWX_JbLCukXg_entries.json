In this talk I will describe techniques used to improve the performance and efficiency of a data build system that was developed as part of a AAA game project.\n\nI will briefly describe the differences between how the game code and data building code operate, how those differences impact processing performance, how a profiler can be used to identify trouble spots, and describe techniques I used to parallel data processing system performance.\n\nWhile this is coming from a game development perspective the techniques can be applied to any task based parallel data processing system.\n---\n\nSlides: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2024/blob/main/Presentations/Techniques_to_Optimise_Multithreaded_Data_Building_During_Gam",
