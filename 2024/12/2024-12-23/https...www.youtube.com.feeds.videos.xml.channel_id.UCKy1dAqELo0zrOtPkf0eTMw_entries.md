JAWS pinball is chock full of chummy, gooey goodness, with a blood-in-the water simulation on its playfield, a bunch of interactive nautical toys and boats, and a shark fin that pops up for you to shoot. It takes full advantage of the classic Spielberg flick about a fish with the munchies, too, with tons of original movie scenes and sounds. This MANEATER is a QUARTER MUNCHER! (Sorry!).
