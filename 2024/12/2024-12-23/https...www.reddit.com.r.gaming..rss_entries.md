<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Multiple times now I&#39;m playing something that&#39;s free to play with cosmetic microtransactions, and I&#39;m enjoying the game, I haven&#39;t paid anything for it, and I think to myself: &quot;Sure, that costume is really cool! I&#39;ll pick it up.&quot;</p> <p>But then when I see how much it costs, sometimes as much as $30 or $40, I completely rule it out as I&#39;m not paying half the cost of an entire game for a single piece of cosmetics. </p> <p>Now if those cosmetics were $3 or $4, I&#39;d drop the money down without even thinking about it. I&#39;d buy upwards of 10 different things, spend the same amount of money as I would for what they are charging for the single costume now, but I&#39;d actually feel like I got my money&#39;s worth. </p> <p>So what I don&#39;t understand is this: I feel like if the microtransactions were a 10th of the cost, they would get hundreds more sales and overall make more money. Why do they not do this? There ha

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I wanted for Persona series to get more recognition it deserves since Persona 3 vanilla 18 years ago. It feels good to have more people appreciate what Atlus does with their games. I hope that the Trails series from Falcom will get more love as well now that they will release a remake of the first Trails game next year. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/nyx_celestia"> /u/nyx_celestia </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1hkfgw5/favorite_niche_games_that_surprisingly_gained/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1hkfgw5/favorite_niche_games_that_surprisingly_gained/">[comments]</a></span>
