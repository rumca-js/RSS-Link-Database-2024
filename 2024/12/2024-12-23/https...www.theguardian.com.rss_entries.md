<p><strong>Omnibus theatre, London<br></strong>Nick Danan is captivating as a power-hungry, parasitic theatre critic drawn into a supernatural world </p><p>This lesser revived monologue by Conor McPherson begins with male mid-life crisis but heads into a direction that is altogether more unfamiliar and alluring. A man sits before us, telling his story with the intimacy of a confession. He is a Dublin-based theatre critic, played by Nick Danan, jaded and power hungry, though not quite as flatly villainous as Ian McKellen’s drama reviewer in Patrick Marber’s The Critic. He speaks of his drinking, his distance from his family and his search for a story that will elevate him into the ranks of the artists he so envies.</p><p>For a while, it seems as if this is little more than an acid-tipped screed against journalists. But McPherson’s monologue warms up when it enters into supernatural territory. The atmosphere is that of a ghost story but with a cast of enigmatic vampires who do not kill

<p>The Hayat Tahrir al-Sham regime, which has friendly relations with Turkey, is unlikely to tolerate Kurdish autonomy</p><p>The fall of Bashar al-Assad after the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) takeover in Syria is bad news for the country’s Kurds. It is worth charting how things got here from the start of the war in Syria in 2012. During the conflict, the Democratic Union party (PYD) emerged as the biggest and most influential Kurdish political actor in Syria, taking territorial control in the north and maintaining an autonomous administration, albeit a fragile one.</p><p>The PYD’s position is even more precarious after the HTS takeover. Turkey, emerging as the most influential foreign actor in Syria, is laser-focused on limiting any Kurdish push for autonomy domestically and regionally. Another challenge the PYD faces is that the HTS-led regime is very unlikely to tolerate existing Kurdish autonomy in Syria.</p><p>Dr Zeynep Kaya is a lecturer in international relations at the Universit

The reason for this, according to the more plausible origin myths and etymology accepted by linguistic science, is the introduction to a Livornese tavern (possibly by a Turkish sea merchant) of a Turkish fish soup called <em>balık çorbası</em>. The resourceful and quickly adopted recipe called for <em>küçük</em> <em>balık</em> (small fish), and <em>küçük</em> was borrowed and became cacciucco.</p><p>However the soup came into being, a recipe made from an amalgam of fish had the most favourable environment in a thriving Tuscan seaport with its amalgam of communities, as well as in the arrival of tomatoes in everyday cooking, in the late 1700

<p>The latest in our series of writers revealing their favourite mood-lifting films is an ode to the 1991 comedy in which Steve Martin is a farcically over-protective father</p><p>I should hate this film. A possessive father loses the plot at the notion that his 22-year-old daughter – a sophisticated architecture student just back from a semester in Rome – is engaged to a man he hasn’t met. After she tells him the news at dinner, we see her saying it a second time through his eyes, as a seven-year-old. When the groom arrives, dad almost has an aneurysm at him daring to put his hand on her leg, and starts watching America’s Most Wanted every night looking for his face. He goes so cuckoo bananas over the prospect of their wedding that he loses it at the supermarket and briefly ends up in jail. “I was no longer the man in my little girl’s life,” he rues. It is paternalistic nonsense, and it is perfect.</p><p>I first watched the 1991 remake of Father of the Bride (FOTB) as a kid because

After all, it was a remake of a 1980 NBC miniseries which at the time garnered the second highest viewing figures in TV history. That, in turn, was based on a book by James Clavell that had shifted millions of copies. The popularity of Shōgun was never been in doubt.</p><p>But as a thing to remake? In 2024? Yeesh.

Now warning systems are in place, but some feel more could be done</p><p>It was just before 8am on Sunday 26 December 2004 when the earthquake struck. Abdul Rahem, 47, a fisher, was strolling along the beach, enjoying the morning breeze near to his home in Lam Awe, a sleepy fishing village on the coast of Aceh in Indonesia. He retreated to paddy fields when the violent shaking and swinging stopped. But it wasn’t until he heard the cries of neighbours that he realised something was seriously wrong. People were shouting: “The water is coming.”</p><p>Rahem raced home to get his elderly father, and supported him as they tried to flee along the broken road, which had been twisted and torn by the quake. His father urged him to go ahead and leave him, but Rahem refused. “I said, ‘No, no, no, if we die, we die together.’”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/dec/23/20-years-after-boxing-day-tsunami-aceh-indo

There were pockets of interest in the fighters’ Ukrainian and English homelands. But beyond that, the response was muted. Indeed, the promotion all but wrote off the United States market by scheduling the fight opposite the first round of the College Football Playoff tournament.

<p>Cornish intrigues in an implausible thriller about a woman who wakes up in a police station with no memory of how she got there</p><p>When Rebecca (Abbie Cornish) wakes up handcuffed in a police interview room with no memory of how she got there, something feels off. The officers grilling her about a hit and run seem legit at first: a detective (Moon Bloodgood) with a hard, mean stare is classic bad cop, assisted by a genial sidekick (Laz Alonso) who walks in with doughnuts. But the precinct is grotty even by police standards. What’s wrong with the place? You don’t have to wait long to find out. Just 12 minutes in, this overheated psychological thriller noir delivers an almighty plot twist. Like the movie, it’s more ridiculous than interesting.</p><p>Despite its B or even C-movie approach, Detained is given a bit of weight by an intriguing performance by Cornish. It unfolds almost entirely in the police precinct, where Rebecca is told she was found passed out behind the wheel at 2

Nine games into his tenure, the Portuguese’s coach record is poor – four wins, four losses and a draw – and the next four matches look tough: Wolves (away), Newcastle (home), Liverpool (away) and a trip to Arsenal in the FA Cup.

<p>From the sisters in Nobody Wants to Ashley Jensen’s detective in Shetland, one hairstyle dominated ambient TV this year</p><p>The 2024 Netflix series Nobody Wants This was widely adored for many reasons – not least the concept of the Hot Rabbi, the renaissance of its star, former The OC geek-hearthrob Adam Brody, and the soothing LA lifestyle porn. But, for many of us, through Brody’s co-stars Kristen Bell and Justine Lupe, it was simply another 2024 example of what has become known in some quarters as “TV hair”.</p><p>Throughout the series, Bell and Lupe, playing two very LA sisters who co-host a podcast about sex and relationships, sport a very specific brand of subtly waved hair. Neither ringlets nor straight, it’s glossy and well-styled, done but not too “done”. And it’s in any TV series where white women are the main characters – see Meghann Fahey in The Perfect Couple; Rose Byrne in Platonic; or even, back in 2021, Anna Kendrick in Love Life. It’s arrived in the UK too – Ash

<p>The jockey had remarkable career triumphs but he’s still infamous for punching a horse and a rival rider </p><p>Davy Russell’s wife, Edelle, sometimes brings out a skeleton that resembles his battered body during her anatomy classes at school. The skeleton looks as if it has contracted measles because it is covered in red dots, with each dot marking a bone that Russell broke during his 21 years as a professional jump jockey. He had a remarkable career where he became Ireland’s champion jockey three times, won the Grand National twice, as well as the Gold Cup, while also being infamous for punching a horse and a rival rider before he finally stopped racing in 2023.</p><p>“It doesn’t bother me,” Russell says as he confirms that the skeleton is still wheeled out at Edelle’s school down the road from&nbsp;where he and I have lunch in his kitchen in Youghal, a small town&nbsp;less than an hour from Cork. “When there’s a quiz on the telly and they ask where is the ulna bone, your fibula

<p>He became a household name after ITV turned Britain’s biggest miscarriage of justice into a drama. He reflects on his fight for compensation, turning down an OBE – and getting married on Richard Branson’s island </p><p>Sir Alan Bates is at home in Llandudno with his wife Suzanne.

But gradually his campaign built up steam, thanks largely to his tireless work. In January, ITV turned it into a gripping docudram
