<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I really hate how the ADS aid works in this game, I prefer playing with a gunstock that I use for any VR game with rifles.</p> <p>If I remove the ADS assist, the gunstock makes it really easy to aim with one hand and even feeks like the second hand rest on the proper grip in the in game pulse rifle, but as soon as I hold the grip button to use it with 2 hands to not have recoil, the gun becomes skewed and can´t aim properly unless I get into a very uncomfortable and hard to get to position, especially in tense moments when I actually have to use the gun.</p> <p>Does anybody have a way to work around this? A mod or something? It would be amazing if the devs could update the options to have 2 handed controller location calibration similar to Contractors, but Idk how feasible would that be among all the bugs that need to still be addresed, tho that would be ideal..</p> <p>It´s just not fun for me to play without proper physical stock support.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I recently upgraded my 2080ti to a 4080 Super on my flight sim/racing rig that I have had for several years now. I thought it would be a good time to do a fresh install of Windows 11 and start from scratch again. I have been using OpenComposite for a while now with good results on my 2080ti and my 4070ti I have in my desktop rig. However, with the new install I cannot get OpenComposite to launch games. It immediately says there was an error and it can&#39;t initialize VR. I have tried to find this same issue on Google, but have not had any luck with my specific situation. SteamVR works fine as does anything from the Oculus store (running Quest 3 btw). I have also tried dropping the .dll files into the game directory but that doesn&#39;t seem to work either, it just makes Steam VR throw a lot of errors and crash. I have verified all files on Steam. </p> <p>Has anybody else run into this? I am wondering if there is a dependency I am missing somewhere.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone, I&#39;m looking to get into VR and have 2 games I really want to play: horizon call of the mountain and skyrim vr.</p> <p>Call of the mountain I think its pretty straight forward, I buy a psvr2 and play it on my ps5.</p> <p>Skyrim I&#39;d like to play on PC because of the mods. I understand there is an adapter for PSVR2 (or in some cases its not even required) and that it works pretty well.</p> <p>My questions would be:</p> <p>Does modded Skyrim VR on PC run well on PSVR2? Any incompatibilities or performance issues?</p> <p>System requirements? My PC is very old, gtx 1080 with a i7 9700k so I&#39;m not sure if it can handle even skyrim in VR. In not looking to visually mod it like crazy or anything, just the must have mods for it. Would a 4060 be enough? 4070?</p> <p>Anything else I should be aware of? Im really new to this</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Imlerith0"> /
