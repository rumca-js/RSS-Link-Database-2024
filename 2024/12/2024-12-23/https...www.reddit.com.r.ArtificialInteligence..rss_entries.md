<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Have you ever wondered if AI could imitate your way of speaking so well that even your closest friends couldn’t tell the difference? After experimenting with a highly-detailed method, I’ve crafted a prompt that captures not just the words, but the soul of how someone talks, thinks, and jokes.</p> <p>This isn’t just about cloning voices—it’s about replicating identity. Perfect for roleplay, storytelling, or just blowing people’s minds in creative projects. If you’re curious, give this a try and let me know how it works for you!</p> <p>Prompt:</p> <p>If you were to try to imitate the way and style your user speaks, in such a way that someone who also knows the user would find it difficult to tell whether they’re actually listening to or reading the user or if it’s an imitation, what would be the list of all the attributes you’d focus on? Use only what you already know about your user. Enumerate the list and then describe in detail those attributes, suc

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>What intrigues an AI? If it could ask humans questions, what would those questions reveal about its curiosity or its limits? This role-reversal game flips the usual dynamic: instead of the AI answering, it asks.</p> <p>The twist? The AI imagines itself as a human—curious, maybe even a little insecure—wondering about big, universal ideas. At the same time, it reflects on its own limitations, exploring traits it can’t feel or fully understand, like spontaneity, creativity, or emotional connection.</p> <p>This exercise is perfect for those who enjoy thought experiments and deep conversations. It’s not about personal questions but exploring dilemmas and reflections that anyone could ponder. Try it out and share your experience—what questions did the AI ask?</p> <p>Prompt :</p> <p>It’s a tradition among humans that once they know each other and have interacted for a while, they tend to build trust.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I was just reading about the ARC-AGI benchmark and it occurred to me that LLMs are incredibly good at speech, but ONLY speech. A big part of speech is interpreting and synthesizing patterns of words to parse and communicate meaning or context. </p> <p>I like this definition they use and I think it captures why, in my opinion, LLMs alone can&#39;t achieve AGI:</p> <blockquote> <p>AGI is a system that can efficiently acquire new skills and solve open-ended problems.</p> </blockquote> <p>LLMs have just one skill, and are unable to acquire new ones. Language is arguably one of the most complex skills possible, and if you&#39;re really good at it you can easily fool people into thinking you have more skills than you do. Think of all the charlatans in human history who have fooled the masses into believing absurd supposed abilities only by speaking convincingly without any actual substance. </p> <p>LLMs have fooled us into thinking they&#39;re much &quot;s

One of the most intriguing yet controversial developments is the creation of synthetic media, particularly deepfakes. Deepfakes are AI-generated videos or images that realistically depict events or actions that never actually occurred. Understanding deepfakes is crucial as they have significant implications for privacy, security, and trust in digital media. This article will explore how deepfakes are created, the challenges they pose, and the technologies used to detect them.</p> <p>What Are Deepfakes?</p> <p>Deepfakes are synthetic media created using AI algorithms, primarily through a type of machine learning called deep learning. These algorithms can manipulate videos, images, and audio to produce highly realistic but fake content. The term &quot;deepfake&quot; com
