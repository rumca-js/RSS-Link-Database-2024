<p class="has-drop-cap has-text-align-none">While <em>Dune: Prophecy</em> is a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tv/479937/dune-prophecy-houses-emperor-corrino-atreides-harkonnen-hart">(very loose) literary adaptation</a>, the HBO series ultimately defines itself by its ties to Denis Villeneuve’s Dune movies. In and of itself, that’s no big deal. 2024 has seen a now-standard flurry of shows released under the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars">Star Wars</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/dc">DC</a>, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/marvel">Marvel</a> labels (to name just a few) — all of the

<p class="has-text-align-none">One of my favorite <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23950861/steam-deck-oled-review-valve-handheld-gaming">Steam Deck</a> upgrades costs more than a Steam Deck. I’ve been testing out Xreal’s new $499 One AR glasses, which can serve as an external display for the console by connecting a USB-C cable between the two. The One glasses work with other devices capable of pushing video from a USB-C port, too, such as some phones, tablets, and computers, but sadly, not the Nintendo Switch (fingers crossed that it’s supported on the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/nintendo/23899504/nintendo-switch-2-release-date-power-name-games">Switch 2</a>).&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Life is stressful. Sometimes it’s difficult to unwind. For me, a surefire method to improve my mood when I’m feeling down has been watching Australian radio station Triple J’s Like A Version series, which includes a regular segment where established and up-and-coming artists alike cover classic or new hits.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Sometimes the covers are close to the original; sometimes they’re completely different. Most of the time, they bring me a direct dose of joy, either introducing me to new artists and songs or recontextualizing my appreciation for older hits – whether I liked the original version
