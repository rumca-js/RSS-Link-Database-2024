 The halt follows a severe respiratory disease safety signal observed in a July 2024 phase 1 trial of Moderna's mRNA-1345 and mRNA-1365 vaccine candidates.

A phase I trial

The effects of the medication on about 20 to 80 healthy volunteers

To evaluating safety and ideal dosage

70% move on to phase II

This study, safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity

Who were the subjects
