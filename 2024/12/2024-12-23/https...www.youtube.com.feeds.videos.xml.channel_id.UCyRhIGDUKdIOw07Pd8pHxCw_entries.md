How to Play: https://youtu.be/aIDl5suP_QE

In Wilmot’s Warehouse, your team will work cooperatively to organize the warehouse, using memory, imagination, and silly stories you make up.

DRAW product tiles off the stack, DISCUSS what they look like, and PLACE them somewhere youʼll remember!

After you place each tile, you flip it over and canʼt look at it again until the end of the game.
So your team has to remember where youʼve placed previous tiles as you decide where to place new ones.
