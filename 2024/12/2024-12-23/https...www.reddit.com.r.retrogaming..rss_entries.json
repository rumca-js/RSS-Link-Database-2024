They were very well-off, so they lived in a nice suburban area in a house with two floors. In particular, they had a huge basement area with a living room, two bedrooms, a bathroom, and the furnace room. This basement area is where where all of the kids would flock to when the adults wanted them to have fun and be out of the way, so they had a TV, a closet with tons of toys, and a computer with games on it. They also had a hand-me-down NES in the furnace room as a secondary source of entertainment if kids were extra bored.</p> <p>Nobody was ever in that room, but that&#39;s where I spent most of my downtime.
