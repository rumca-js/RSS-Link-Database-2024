That&#39;s what I read online.</p> <p>Why do we see passwords leaks, phone number leaks, but never search history leaks or messages leaks? Can it ever happen? Do you think it will and can we protect ourselves from it? In other ways than using safe browsers and apps to message, I didn&#39;t always and became worried because obviously I would not want my information be avaible for everyone.</p> <p>Google, FB, sell our data to other places.
