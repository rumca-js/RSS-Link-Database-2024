The most important of its many capabilities is as a charging socket for battery-powered devices. USB-C <em>should</em> finally make everything simple: One socket, one cable, one power supply for all devices \u2013 from computers to smartphones and tablets to headphones and other peripherals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So much for the theory, which always sounds simple with USB. The reality is more confusing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not every USB-C power supply is suitable for every device. Not all Type-C ports can be used to charge devices quickly or at all. And not every Type-C cable ensures reliable power transmission. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This guide will give you an overview of the technical possibilities of Type-C charging and recommends suitable power supply units for all devices.

Just look at the Steam Deck and its many imitators: it\u2019s the most popular gaming PC on the market by far, and it\u2019s running off a laptop chip from several years ago. The upshot is you\u2019ve got more choices than ever for games on a low-power PC.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even so, I\u2019ve picked ten fantastic new PC games that\u2019ll run on a toaster, so long as you can find a toaster that\u2019ll run Windows (or SteamOS). And it sure doesn\u2019t hurt that they\u2019re a lot cheaper than AAA games, too \u2014 the better to make the most out of any Steam gift cards you have laying around. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are my picks, in no particular order.

Thanks to the extraordinary growth of remote workforces, the adoption of cloud-based networking, and new cyber threats, the old network security model just no longer works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this time of ultimate shareability and interconnectedness, threats can come from any angle\u2014including inside your network. Enter the Zero Trust security framework. By trusting none and verifying all, Zero Trust can make any network, home of business, become Fort Knox.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the old \u201ccastle and moat\u201d style of protecting networks going by the wayside, many speculate that VPNs will follow suit. So what does this all mean for the security of your data and will you still be using a VPN in a few years time? Let\u2019s dig in to find out more and see what the future holds fo",
