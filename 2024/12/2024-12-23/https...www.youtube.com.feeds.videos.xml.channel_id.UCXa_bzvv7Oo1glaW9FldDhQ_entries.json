        "description": "Pine Harbor is a survival horror game where the player is tasked with surviving in the eponymous town. A mysterious accident at a factory eventually leads to the entire town being abandoned, and the player finds themselves there in an attempt to reconnect with their father after getting a letter. \n\nThe player quickly finds out, however, that something is deeply wrong with the town. The general gameplay in Pine Harbor revolves around hunting for supplies during the day, and surviving against aggressive enemies at night. The game borrows heavily from seminal horror titles like Silent Hill in terms of general atmosphere.\n\nUnfortunately, the fact that it is an Early Access release means that there are quite a few problems with the title, ranging from bad quest design and terrible voice acting to generally boring gameplay owing to a lack of combat options.",
