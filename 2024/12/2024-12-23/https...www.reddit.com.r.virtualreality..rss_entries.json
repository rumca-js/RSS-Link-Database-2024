I thought it would be a good time to do a fresh install of Windows 11 and start from scratch again. I have been using OpenComposite for a while now with good results on my 2080ti and my 4070ti I have in my desktop rig. However, with the new install I cannot get OpenComposite to launch games. It immediately says there was an error and it can&#39;t initialize VR. I have tried to find this same issue on Google, but have not had any luck with my specific situation. SteamVR works fine as does anything from the Oculus store (running Quest 3 btw). I have also tried dropping the .dll files into the game directory but that doesn&#39;t seem to work either, it just makes Steam VR throw a lot of errors and crash. I have verified all files on Steam. </p> <p>Has anybody else run into this? I am wondering if there is a dependency I am missing somewhere. ",

The only thing I see of vr gloves though tend to be tech demos, they seem to be in a little bit of an odd spot with no real progress because of how unproven they are, still the testing phase so to speak, so I was wondering what&#39;s the latest news with them? Still a niche within a niche or is there actual progress being made? of course on a more &quot;consumer&quot; level (in quotes because let&#39;s be real they&#39;ll likely still be very expensive).</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/jackatron1\"> /u/jackatron1 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1hkcouo/whats_happening_with_vr_gloves_still_too_niche/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https",

Takes 3 seconds to put on or take off.</p> <p>Software/Support: Props to bHaptics on making some pretty good and comprehensive software. I did not expect this. There is a Steam/PC app, mobile app, and Meta app. Each can control the suit. Moreso, you can completely customize how the vest works in here, and even create and share custom profiles. One of my first concerns was that not a lot of newer games have native support. And this is true. The ",
