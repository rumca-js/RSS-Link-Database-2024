Schluter shower pan tips…I cut this pan to a custom size. But, before I did that, I cut off the 3/4 inch perimeters. These perimeters are flat and help with the wall tile installation. The 7 inch KERDI-BAND extends beyond the reinstalled perimeters by 3 to 4 inches. And this keeps the shower system waterproof. I also use this banding for custom shower curbs 👍🏽🔥#schlutersystems #bathroomrenovation #tileshower #brandpartner
