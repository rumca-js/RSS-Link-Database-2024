If you know any similar films that would work, but mostly I am looking for books. Please, nothing with magic, paranormal, or heavy sci-fi elements. It would be great if the titles were more historical or took place in a world we would recognize as the past. My manuscript centers around court drama and the death of a king, if that helps.

His eyesight has deteriorated with age and he can only read large print editions. but, like, selection is pretty bogusly limited. titles I know he would love like Small Things Like These and Slow Horses I can&#39;t find in large print for love or money. it&#39;s frustrating. I&#39;m at the point of considering if I should reformat a digital edition myself and get it printed at kinkos or something. I&#39;m sure that&#39;s illegal, but I don&#39;t know what else to do. is there a legal way to get a custom large print book? He loves reading, hates eReaders (bc he&#39;s 78 &amp; a total luddite), and misses books. any suggestions?</p> <p>again, apologies if this kind of post doesn&#39;t belong here. thank you for your help. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/LoudResoundingNoise\"> /u/LoudResoundingNoise </a> <br/>",
