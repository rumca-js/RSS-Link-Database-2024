The mod is recreating the Quake 2 experience in a whole new light through it&#39;s Single Player and Multiplayer components. Our aim is to give players a whole new Quake 2 experience and not just a remake of the original. While you may experience some gameplay from the original, most of the experiences are completely new. We have done away with linear gameplay and have given the player multiple ways to deal with situations. This is Quake 2 the way we want to see Quake 2 done within the DOOM 3
