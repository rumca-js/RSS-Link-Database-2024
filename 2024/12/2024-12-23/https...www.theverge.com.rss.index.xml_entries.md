  <p id="vK7I3E">The PayPal Honey browser extension is, in theory, a handy way to find better deals on products while you’re shopping online. But in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc4yL3YTwWk">video published this weekend</a>, YouTuber MegaLag claims the extension is a “scam” and that Honey has been “stealing money from influencers, including the very ones they paid to promote their product.”</p>
<p id="dERDBD">Honey works by popping up an offer to find coupon codes for you while you’re checking out in an online shop. But as MegaLag notes, it frequently fails to find a code, or offers a Honey-branded one, even if a simple internet search will cover something better.

They weren’t the first tales about undead ghouls rising from the grave to suck the blood out of the living. But by presenting their monsters in such wildly innovative ways, they became a blueprint from which countless subsequent tales took inspiration. Writer / director Robert Eggers knows
