## DEAD DANCE/ TUFF E NUFF is a 1993 beatem'up that jumped on the craze of street fighter in the 90s. Often overlooked and underappreciated, this rather stylish and unique game is plagued with a very bad usa cover. The game has also an rpg element in the story mode. A fun game that i highly recommend.

Obviously good gameplay is important, but no matter how fun it is, we sometimes lose steam after a bit if there isn&#39;t a story driving us forward. Almost every game we&#39;ve played to the end has had a solid story. It&#39;s such a satisfying experience for us to get to the end when the story is really good.</p> <p>We&#39;ve played both Baldur&#39;s Gate Dark Alliance games. Neither story may have been an earth-shattering kaboom, but they were interesting enough that we had a lot of fun finishing both games. On the other hand, we&#39;ve tried to complete Champions of Norrath twice (essentially the same gameplay as Dark Alliance), but fizzled out around the same place both times because the story just felt kind of basic.</p> <p>I&#39;ve heard good things about the stories of Secret o

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Been pretty stressed lately, so here&#39;s a fun little nostalgic piece about my first memories playing the NES.</p> <p>We have a huge family in northern Iowa, and every summer and winter we would take a 15 hour drive to go stay at our Grandma&#39;s house. They were very well-off, so they lived in a nice suburban area in a house with two floors. In particular, they had a huge basement area with a living room, two bedrooms, a bathroom, and the furnace room. This basement area is where where all of the kids would flock to when the adults wanted them to have fun and be out of the way, so they had a TV, a closet with tons of toys, and a computer with games on it. They also had a hand-me-down NES in the furnace room as a secondary source of entertainment if kids were extra bored.</p> <p>Nobody was ever in that room, but that&#39;s where I spent most of my downtime. We would go to the park or something for the day and have fun, then after supper I would ju

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m playing through DeusEx for the thousandth time or so, and I&#39;m wondering what moments in games we&#39;re truly surprising. Not necessarily a twist in a story, but more like surprising options or details.</p> <p>For instance (spoiler alerts), the first time I had the idea to try taking out Anna Navarre on the plane, I expected it to be a bug if it actually worked. I set a few LAMs outside the door, and holy crap it worked! And there was a whole new set of dialogue that came with it. I genuinely thought I had a fresh idea, but they saw me coming. Same for rescuing Paul. Never would have imagined it was possible, but with enough gas grenades and planning, it worked! And again, a whole new set of dialogue came with it.</p> <p>It&#39;s those kinds of things that really make you wonder what else is possible.</p> <p>Curious what other moments y&#39;all might have.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/u

I grew up in the 80&#39;s and my first computer was an Acorn Electron followed by a BBC Micro a Spectrum, Amstrad, Amiga, Megadrive, SNES, PlayStation and lastly an Xbox ( Most of which I still own and cherish greatly ) A pretty familiar tale to 80&#39;s / 90&#39;s kids. My favourite era was the mid&#39; 90&#39;s where Sega and Nintendo were joined by PlayStation, it just felt awesome and the games were amazing. To relive those moments now feels extremely expressive unless you kept alot of your games and I&#39;ve seen prices for truly awful games reach stratospheric levels. I only collect games that I enjoyed playing or that I wanted to own ie, I paid £40 for Moonwalker, boxed with the manual. I never owned it but enjoyed playing it at a friend&#39;s and I think this is actually cheaper than when it was new... So how m
