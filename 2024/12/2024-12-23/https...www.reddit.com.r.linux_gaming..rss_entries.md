My initial post: &quot;So I cannot run this game without it crashing, most of the time those crashes freezing up my entire pc and I end up needing to hard power off my whole computer. It works for a couple games at least in debug mode, but I can&#39;t run it on steam normally without it crashing and I have to reboot. I can&#39;t even run PROTON_LOG=1 in launch options, the game won&#39;t start up. What commands do I need to run to get help troubleshooting? I&#39;m still quite new to this, so I apologize for providing so little information up front. Just tell me what you need and I&#39;ll provide it.

I ran into some issues, including the app not starting after successfully installing it. After I used the installation provided by Bottles, I was able to run the app, but the app seemed to have no internet connection despite the Bottle having internet connection. So I decided to use the install script by Lutris to install Far Cry 5 in Lutris. I was able to install it, but the game had extremely long to start up. Also after making it ingame, the performance was horrendous. I played it on Windows before on the same machine, so it should have been way better. I was using Hyprland, so I thought maybe it is because i am running Wayland, so I tried running it on plasma (X11), but this time it didn’t even start up. Also after retrying it in Hyprland, it also didn’t start. </p> <p>Important information: OS: Arch Linux on the Linux Kernel (non-lts) Runner on Bottles: soda (newes

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am on the latest driver, kernel and KDE Plasma versions. My external monitor says &quot;no signal detected&quot; but it will flash but remain on black screen and not rcieve signal. Ive been having this issue for a few months now, and I cant reboot my computer but its broken completely now, previously i could fix it by turning off my monitor, unplugging and replugging back in and turning on monitor. This no longer works.</p> <p>I tried running fedora gnome, and garuda hyprland off a usb stick and the external monitor works great so this is certainly a kde/arch/kernel issue.</p> <p>How to fix, pls help. Im at the end of my rope for this.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/conan--aquilonian"> /u/conan--aquilonian </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1hkfbrf/archlinux_nvidia_latest_external_monitor_no/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Super new to using pop os. Started down the rabbit hole of online footprint management and realized how invasive kernel level anti cheats are and wanted to switch to Linux. Got everything all set up but there are a few games I still enjoy playing. </p> <p>Plan is to have Linux as main os for gaming/productivity and then have a win11 os on a separate nvme for playing games that just don’t run well on Linux. </p> <p>Direct me to FAQ if needed but I couldn’t find a better way to word it in the search bar. </p> <p>My question is, will it be dangerous to have games that have EAC or ACE on the win11 drive and use that drive ONLY for gaming. Just need a sanity check if this is common. In my head it makes sense that since there’s little to no sensitive data on that os then it should be fine right?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Milllidelphia"> /u/Milllidelphia </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddi
