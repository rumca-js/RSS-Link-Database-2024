<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I want to start a new fantasy read or continue one but I&#39;m not sure which to pick. I have read the first 2 stormlight, Elantris and warbreaker, the first 2 wot, king killer Chronicles, and LOTR and the Hobbit. That is the extent, but I do know I love fantasy and don&#39;t mind very big commitments or very long books. </p> <p>I was thinking Malazan, but I wasn&#39;t sure how graphic it is. I do not think I would like GOT due to how graphic it is, mainly sexually, and was wondering if Malazan is similar. It&#39;s not a deal breaker, I would just rather not read very explicit scenes every couple of chapters. (I don&#39;t even know if got is like that, I&#39;ve just heard it was)</p> <p>Also I do not even know much about Malazan, maybe it isn&#39;t the right place to continue my fantasy journey, should I keep reading wot? Or is there another series that would be better.</p> <p>Note: I like high fantasy, complex world building and scope, cool magic sy

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>As a child I remember watching a children’s fantasy movie or miniseries on TV and I’ve been curious to find out what it was ever since. This was probably in 1989. I believe it was a made-for-TV movie or a miniseries and I feel like it was made around the same time that I watched it. It definitely wouldn’t have been made after 1990.</p> <p>It was similar to The Chronicles of Narnia in terms of it being about a kid (or group of kids) who travels to a magical fantasy land and goes on a quest. It might’ve started out in modern times and then the kid travels back to medieval times, but I’m not positive. There is only one scene that I remember. The kid is walking outside near a forest and a magical court jester appears in front of him. The court jester says something about being a fool, snaps his fingers, and then disappears.</p> <p>If anyone has any idea what this might be, I’d be very grateful. I’ve been wondering what this movie/show was ever since and

This whole arc can happen right from the beginning or in a later book. The story can be also narrated from the perspective of somebody already on earth as they meet this &quot;newcomer&quot; but I would prefer the other way round. Also preferably a multi-book series.</p> <p>Thank you very much!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Green_Philosophy_301"> /u/Green_Philosophy_301 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1hkc9ap/reversed_portal_fantasy_reversed_isekai_mc_from/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/commen

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’m curious how fanbases of popular fantasy series have impacted your enjoyment of a series?</p> <p>Obviously the correct answer is that other people shouldn’t influence how much one enjoys something… but I feel like even if we don’t realize it, even if we don’t want it to, fanbases can do just that.</p> <p>Some fanbases can be antagonistic/toxic and make you like a series less… while others can be really opening/kind and make you want to read a series even more…</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Oddyseus144"> /u/Oddyseus144 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1hkbv10/fanbases/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1hkbv10/fanbases/">[comments]</a></span>
