I want a place where I can stay informed from the sources I consider most reliable (X, Reddit, Telegram, newspapers) without having to spend my car insurance money annually... Nowadays you can get a library of 120,000 books for free, have Youtube or Spotify Premium for free but not centralize your favorite sources of information.

Then I decided to create an app to meet my requirements and to learn Rust (Something I want to do for years) so I finished creating <a href=\"https://chaski.a-chacon.com\">Chaski</a>, a simple feed reader that have a modern interface and permit to me read the news on the app.</p> <p>This does nothing different from other RSS readers, but I put attention to the UX (It don&#39;t look like an email client hehe) and I try to give a focus on the quality of read and not the quantity of read (not count unread entries). Have another basic features like import/export OPML, light/dark mode, configurable fonts, off-line mode and another things.</p> <p>Compiled for Linux (Tested), Windows (Tested), MacOs (Untested).</p> <p>This is open source, free and open to contributions/feedback. It helps me every day to read news ",
