Unfortunately, we only recently had the time to sit down, learn and play it, but we&#39;ve loved it with my SO very much. I&#39;m thinking of buying expansions, except, I do not see any deluxe versions sold anywhere. However, the stock photos where the expansions are sold show the minis. </p> <p>So my question is, do the expansion not have a separate standard and deluxe edition, and just contain the minis?

But I want to have something that satisfies their Euro hunger and makes us all happy, but not bores me to death.</p> <p>So my question would be: What are the best Boardgames that are Euros but don&#39;t realy feel like Euros and don&#39;t play for multiple hours?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/newZorro50\"> /u/newZorro50 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1hkl5hd/eurogames_that_dont_feel_like_eurogames/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https:",

The corner of the box where it is glued together was split open, and the top flaps had two pieces of tape over it, with one of the flaps partially covering the shipping label. This leads me to believe that at some point the box split open, and someone taped it shot. When I opened it up, there was a small pack of cards that had almost fallen out of the box but got caught on the tape. The main game box is fine, no crunched edges or anything, but the white &quot;extras&quot; box was rather mangled. The items listed for my shipment are:</p> <p>-Clank!

We felt as if the board game is lacking for various reasons such as how it felt like a race to take initiative, and it felt as if there was no room to think for long-term strategy. We also felt limited from making combos because most of the time when we don\u2019t have initiative we are limited to one move plus our prelude. we did not use the lore cards could that be the reason why it felt so lackluster? It felt difficult to expand and and felt safer till I just stay in the planets that we already control.
