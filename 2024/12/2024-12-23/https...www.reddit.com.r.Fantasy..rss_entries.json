It definitely wouldn\u2019t have been made after 1990.</p> <p>It was similar to The Chronicles of Narnia in terms of it being about a kid (or group of kids) who travels to a magical fantasy land and goes on a quest. It might\u2019ve started out in modern times and then the kid travels back to medieval times, but I\u2019m not positive. There is only one scene that I remember. The kid is walking outside near a forest and a magical court jester appears in front of him. The court jester says something about being a fool, snaps his fingers, and then disappears.</p> <p>If anyone has any idea what this might be, I\u2019d be very grateful.

Even though Babel by RF Kuang is a low fantasy book, I enjoyed analyzing the themes and the MC enough to make up for it. </p> <p>I have read some of the standard recommendations I see for Sanderson enjoyers: Kingkiller Chronicles by Rothfuss and Night Angel Trilogy by Brent Weeks but I couldn&#39;t ever actually enjoy either because of either how poorly women were written (that it distracted me from the story; I normally find myself leaning towards male MCs I just can&#39;t stand when authors write women that breast boobily through life or can only be empowered in their society via sex) or in the case of Kin",
