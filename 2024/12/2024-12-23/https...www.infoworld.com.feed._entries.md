<p>Enterprises often encounter friction using <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3268073/what-is-kubernetes-your-next-application-platform.html">Kubernetes</a> (K8s for short) at scale to orchestrate large swaths of <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3310941/why-you-should-use-docker-and-containers.html">containers</a>, not to mention an escalating number of clusters. And due to its complexity, diagnosing issues within Kubernetes isn’t all that easy. At the same time, IT is looking at AI to automate aspects of configuring, managing, and debugging complex back-end technologies.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3607980/what-is-observability-software-monitoring-on-steroids.html">Observability</a>, at its core, is about collecting and analyzing data generated from applications, cloud computing resources, and edge devices to ensure software and services are run smoothly, user experiences are optimized, and resources are managed cost-effectively. According to a <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/articles/monetizing-observable-data-will-separate-the-winners-and-losers#:~:text=Gartner%20expects%20that%20by%202026%2C%2070%%20of,advantage%20for%20target%20business%20or%20IT%20processes.&text=%E2%80%9CObservable%20data%20is%20valuable%20because%20it's%20not,truly%20a

<p>If you’re a developer who wants the most feature-rich, high-performance version of Redis, your choice is clear: Redis and not a fork. If you have time and inclination to dabble in ideological debates about open source licensing, well, you might make another choice. But if you’re just trying to get your job done and want a great database that historically was primarily a cache but today offers much more, you’re going to opt for Redis and not its fork, Valkey.</p>



<p>So argues Redis CEO Rowan Trollope in an interview. “It is unquestionable that Redis, since we launched Redis 8.0 with all the capabilities from Redis Stack, is just a far more capable platform,” he says. He substantiates the clai
