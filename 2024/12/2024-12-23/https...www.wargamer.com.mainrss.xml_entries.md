								<p>For all the grimdark severity of <strong>Warhammer 40k</strong>, there’s no denying that Space Marines look a bit - just a <em>bit</em> - like Buzz Lightyear, the overconfident space adventurer from the Toy Story movies. Nebraska based Dan Sullivan was so taken by the similarity that he decided to make a whole army of Buzz Lightyear marines, complete with fixed grins and a lurid Star Command paint scheme.</p>

								<p>The <strong>Magic: The Gathering</strong> card Indomitable Creativity has undergone a sizable price spike in the wake of last week’s Modern bans. Previously valued at $1.40 (according to the MTG Goldfish price tracker), it’s since risen quickly, all the way up to $11.20. That’s an increase of 700% and the most the card has cost all year. It’s still far below its value in early 2023, however, when it briefly hit $40.</p>
