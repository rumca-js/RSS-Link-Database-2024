## hi everyone, I just recently watched 'The Queen of My Dreams', a gorgeously shot and color graded film about intergenerational trauma + coming of age, starring Amrit Kaur (Bela from TSLOCGs) as a lesbian, Azra, who also plays the young version of her mother, Miriam! I recommend to watch if you can!

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>What&#39;s your favorite adaptation of the Stephen King novel? I saw the Rob Lowe one years ago which I thought was okay despite not being a fan of him as an actor. I saw the tv movie a year ago and really vibed with it. Probably my favorite horror movie/tv movie from the 1970s. You can really tell how damn good it was. Very impressive network tv allowed it to be as good as it was. Now, when I heard of a remake that was due out this year, I was heavily excited and even got my fiance curious about the project. We were hyped for its release back in October, and I was just so let down by what we got. It&#39;s as if Warner Bros intentionally crapped on the film.</p> <p>Currently reading Salem&#39;s Lot so I&#39;m curious what others think about the depictions of the source material.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/RebelWithOddCauses"> /u/RebelWithOddCauses </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit

I’m interested in movies that aren’t afraid to push boundaries and bring something dark and gruesome to the holiday season.</p> <p>While I’ve seen some of the more popular Christmas horror films like Krampus and Black Christmas, I’m hoping to find something a little more hardcore or twisted. Gore, blood, and shocking brutality would definitely be a plus. I’m open to all kinds of horror subgenres—whether it’s a slasher, a supernatural thriller, or a killer Santa film.

## Stranded on an Island, you can take only a few movies with you. The only catch? They must combine for a Rotten Tomatoes score of 100% or lower.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Using the Tomatometer score, and you can pick any number of movies you like. As a bonus, can also take one film with 0%, if you so please. Here’s my lineup as an example.</p> <p>The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou (57%) The Wicker Man (15%) Freddy Got Fingered (12%) Joe Dirt (9%) Miss March (5%) Epic Movie (2%)</p> <p>Life Aquatic is one of my favorite films and is definitely doing the heavy lifting. I wanted a wider range of films, but with only 43% to go around, I had to rely on 2000s comedic flops who’s stupidity seems to bother the film critic community a lot more than it bothers me. I’m a bit of a sucker for 2000s unnecessarily raunchy and/or cringe, intentional or not (looking at you, wicker man). For fun, I’ll make Fred: The Movie (0%) my bonus pick, as the guiltiest pleasure in a whole host of guilty pleasures.</p> <p>Definitely harder than I thought, but was a fun exercise.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>You guys I beg if you have a Stan subscription to watch on Christmas Eve. The film gives you so much Christmas vibes. The film is kid friendly while not being kiddish. Arthur Christmas is a 2011 animated Christmas film produced by Aardman Animations. It focuses on Arthur, the clumsy but well-meaning son of Santa Claus, who works in the high-tech North Pole operation that delivers presents worldwide. In the film, Santa’s modern, gadget-filled sleigh and sophisticated delivery system make the process of gift-giving appear efficient and flawless.</p> <p>However, a mix-up occurs when one child is accidentally missed on Christmas Eve. While Santa and his older son Steve (who runs the operation) don’t see it as a big deal, Arthur is determined to make sure every child receives their gift. With the help of his Grandsanta (Santa’s father, who is old-fashioned) and a team of elves, Arthur embarks on an adventurous mission to deliver the last present in time.<

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey all,</p> <p>It&#39;s our 5th wedding anniversary next week and my husband and I want to watch a solid romantic movie or romcom. We&#39;re looking for something with a positive message or ending, preferably one we haven&#39;t seen before.</p> <p>Our tastes: I&#39;ll watch basically any genre, he will occasionally watch romcoms/musicals with me. Some that he has liked: LaLa Land, 500 Days of Summer, To All the Boys I&#39;ve Loved Before, The Proposal. He did not like 10 Things I Hate About You or You&#39;ve Got Mail. 😂 I haven&#39;t seen many romantic movies beyond those other than the ones &quot;everyone&quot; has seen like The Notebook and Titanic.</p> <p>I&#39;m thinking of maybe trying Love Actually, or something older like Roman Holiday? We&#39;ve been watching a lot of classics this past year (Apocalypse Now, Casablanca, Hot Fuzz, Bill &amp; Ted, Close Encounters, Citizen Kane etc) and have really enjoyed all of them.</p> <p>Any other suggest
