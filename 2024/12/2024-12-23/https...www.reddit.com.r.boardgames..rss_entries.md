However... there was a rocky start.</p> <p>For starters, most of his themes and premises just don&#39;t seem that exciting to me. So that cuts out a significant chunk of his games.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>My copy of the game showed up yesterday, however the brown shipping box was a bit messed up, and it looks like it was retaped (poorly) at some point. The corner of the box where it is glued together was split open, and the top flaps had two pieces of tape over it, with one of the flaps partially covering the shipping label. This leads me to believe that at some point the box split open, and someone taped it shot. When I opened it up, there was a small pack of cards that had almost fallen out of the box but got caught on the tape. The main game box is fine, no crunched edges or anything, but the white &quot;extras&quot; box was rather mangled. The items listed for my shipment are:</p> <p>-Clank!

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone. Me and two people finished a three player session of arcs. We felt as if the board game is lacking for various reasons such as how it felt like a race to take initiative, and it felt as if there was no room to think for long-term strategy. We also felt limited from making combos because most of the time when we don’t have initiative we are limited to one move plus our prelude. we did not use the lore cards could that be the reason why it felt so lackluster? It felt difficult to expand and and felt safer till I just stay in the planets that we already control. What could we be missing or is the game just not for us?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Unalina"> /u/Unalina </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1hke4n6/am_i_missing_something_about_arcs/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1hke4n6/am_i_missing
