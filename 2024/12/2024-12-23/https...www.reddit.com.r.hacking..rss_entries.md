<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>When I open a few websites (example - WSJ.com), I get a message that &quot;There is a robot on the same network (IP XX.XXX.XXX.XXX) as you&quot;. But I can open the same websites in my mobile. I am on wifi on mobile using the same router as my PC. I also cleared cache/history using Ccleaner. What could be an issue. Thanks</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/nvgroups"> /u/nvgroups </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1hkypy7/getting_a_message_of_a_robot_on_the_nw_when_i/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1hkypy7/getting_a_message_of_a_robot_on_the_nw_when_i/">[comments]</a></span>
