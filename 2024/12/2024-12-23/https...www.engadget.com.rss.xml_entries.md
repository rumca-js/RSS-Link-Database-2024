Even better? It’s technically legal. Harbour Masters, the team behind the project, used a tool that converts the original game ROM into PC executable code, so it doesn’t actually use any proprietary Nintendo code.</p>
<p>This is the same method used to <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time-pc-port-201035826.html">create the native PC port</a> of <em>Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</em>, <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://github.com/HarbourMasters/Shipwright"><ins>and that one’s still available for download</ins></a>.

<p>It looks like Meta is preparing to add displays to its popular line of Ray-Ban smart glasses, <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.ft.com/content/77bd9117-0a2d-4bd7-9248-4dd288f695a4"><ins>according to a report by </ins><em><ins>Financial Times</ins></em></a>. These screens could show up in a future iteration of the device as early as next year. The likely release window is the second half of 2025.</p>
<p>According to folks familiar with Meta’s plans, the screens will be on the smaller side and will likely be used to display notifications or responses from Meta’s AI virtual assistant. It’s highly unlikely that the company is planning on making this a full mixed-reality device just yet.</p>

<p>Honda and Nissan have officially confirmed <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/honda-and-nissan-reportedly-open-merger-talks-205454769.html">rumors</a> that they&#39;re pursuing a merger, the companies wrote in a <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://global.honda/en/newsroom/news/2024/c241223beng.html">joint press release</a>. Each would continue to operate under its own brand, but with a new joint holding company as parent. If Nissan-controlled Mitsubishi also came on board, the combined group would become the world&#39;s third largest automaker by sales volume and have a net worth of up to $50 billion.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Infinity Nikki</em> is my favorite new release of 2024. It&#39;s a cotton candy confection of an open-world game that offers a lot more depth and variety than I expected to find. I enjoy the fabulous wardrobe, the low-key puzzles and the charming side quests. But the most surprising thing about <em>Infinity Nikki</em> was something that I&#39;ve been ignoring in games for years: the photo mode.</p>
<p>I didn&#39;t expect this to become a highlight of the <em>Infinity Nikki</em> experience. In fact, when it came up in the long sequence of tutorials during my first session, my initial reaction was, &quot;Oh good, something I can forget about.&quot;</p>

<p>Elon Musk&#39;s X has hiked prices for its ad-free Premium+ subscription service to $22 a month, up from $16 before ($168 to $229 annually), <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/22/x-jacks-up-premium-prices-37-5-hits-some-markets-harder/"><em>TechCrunch</em></a> reported. That represents a 37.5 percent increase, the largest since Elon Musk purchased the platform previously known as Twitter back in 2022.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One stated reason for the hike is that Premium+ is now &quot;completely ads-free,&quot; with X claiming that it&#39;s a &quot;significant enhancement&quot; to the previous ad-free experience. It also promised a few other features. &quot;Premium+ subscribers will enjoy higher priority support from @Premium, access to new features such as [X&#39;s advanced search tool] Radar, and higher limits on our most cutting-edge Grok AI models,&quot; the company wrote in a <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://help.x.com/en/premium-plus-price-update"

<p>Around the world, government organizations are calling out Google for monopolistic practices. The Japan Fair Trade Commission (JFTC) will reportedly announce Google is in violation of the country&#39;s antitrust laws in regards to its search engine, Chrome, and issue a cease and desist letter, <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/Japan-antitrust-watchdog-to-find-Google-violated-law-in-search-case"><em>Nikkei Asia</em> reported</a>. The watchdog started an investigation into Google&#39;s practices last October.</p>
<p>The JFTC reportedly accuses Google of requiring smartphone manufacturers to sign a contract stating Chrome will be not only pre-downloaded on all devices, but that it will be placed in a certain spot on the screen. The manufacturers are allegedly forced to do this in order to have the Google Play available on their devices.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The company has reportedly started testing features like temperature sensing and heart rate monitoring for the earbuds. Apple has found that the Apple Watch still does the latter better, but the AirPods “aren’t terribly far off” in their readings.</p>
<p>The company may have also revived its idea of putting cameras into AirPods, a rumor we’ve heard a few times over the last year. But it’ll still probably be years before any camera-equipped AirPods appear.</p>

## The best E Ink tablets for 2025

<p>I’m a longtime lover of pen and paper, so E Ink tablets have been intriguing to me ever since they started becoming more widely available. After having hundreds of half-filled notebooks over the years, I, at some point, turned to digital tools instead because it was just easier to store everything on my phone or laptop so I always had my most important information at my fingertips.<br><br>E-Ink tablets seem to provide the best of both worlds: the tactile satisfaction of regular notebooks with many of the conveniences found in digital tools, plus easy-on-the-eyes E-Ink screens. These devices have come a long way in recent years — now you can find them in multiple sizes, some have color E Ink screens and others double as full-blow ereaders with access to ebook stores and your local library’s offerings. I’ve tested out close to a dozen E Ink tablets over the past year or two to see how well they work, how convenient they really are and which are the best tablets using E Ink screens a
