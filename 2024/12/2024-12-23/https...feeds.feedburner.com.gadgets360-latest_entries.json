This marks the 22nd close encounter of the spacecraft\u2019s mission, which aims to provide unprecedented insights into the sun\u2019s corona and other solar phenomena. Despite extreme temperatures, the probe is protected by a specialised heat shield, ensuring it can withstand conditions up to 2,500\u00b0F. Updates on its status will follow after the flyby, with detailed science data expected in January 2025",

By analysing the chemical compositions of 16 US and Scottish whiskies, the AI achieved over 90% accuracy in distinguishing between the two, surpassing human expert panels. The technology pinpointed key compounds linked to caramel and smoky notes. This study, published in Communications Chemistry, opens doors for applications in ensuring product consistency, detecting counterfeit whiskies, and even managing odours in other industries like recycled plastics. Further research is needed to address flavour changes during aging",

The survey was conducted by an international team led by J\u00f6rg Fassbinder, a geophysicist at Ludwig-Maximilians-University in Munich. The new data suggests Khorsabad was a far more developed and expansive city than once believed, far beyond the palace complex that was uncovered in previous excavations",

These polymer-based beads break down into molecules resembling sugars and amino acids, making them environmentally safe. When tested on pig skin, the beads demonstrated superior performance in removing permanent marker and eyeliner compared to soap alone. The beads dissolved quickly in boiling water, with over 94 percent breaking down within two hours. This innovation could encourage the skincare industry to adopt more sustainable materials, helping reduce the environmental impact of plastic microbeads in personal care products",

Researchers analysed sediment cores and fossil records from the Dmitry Laptev Strait to reconstruct past environments. The study found significant vegetation shifts, with grasslands replaced by birch and larch forests as temperatures peaked. Arctic warming was amplified due to ice-albedo feedback mechanisms, where melting ice reduced solar reflection, driving further warming",
