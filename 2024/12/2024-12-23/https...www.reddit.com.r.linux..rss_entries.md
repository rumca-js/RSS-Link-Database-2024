But Linux stores everything timestamped in UTC/GMT time. It then uses an timezone offset to say, &quot;Oh, you live near &lt;some place&gt;, that&#39;s UTC-7&quot; and adjusts accordingly so the time/date makes sense to the local user.</p> <p>In the past, Linux was smart enough to know the difference between locally timestam

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, I do like the pros of Flatpak. Sandboxing, dependencies included, cross distro compability sounds just about right to face the problems of common installation methods, but in my personal experience the way those apps run are much more troublesome than even a build from source as the problems are runtime errors.</p> <p>Currently I use Garuda Linux. This distro avoids Flatpaks, but I recently tried out Bazzite and in the matter of the first(!) installation I stumbled upon a problem that is related to Flatpak. (Blender, Optix denoise not working.) The first helpful answer to the problem found online: Don&#39;t use flatpak. -&gt; Issue solved.</p> <p>There are more problems I had in the past like heroic launcher not launching unity games because the needed DLL was not found. Heroic somehow can start the app but is not allowed to load the DLL right beside the exe. Sometimes this error could be resolved using flatseal but sometimes

Where should I start?</p> <p>Firstly, a bit about myself. I switched to Linux in 2020 with Mint 20 Cinnamon, jumped to Arch a few months later, used various distros from Arch to Garuda to Fedora to Nobara until now. I even installed Gentoo with Sway and hastily left it when I realized compiling a browser, or the whole OS, wasn&#39;t for me :) During the years I faced issues that were seemingly random such that either I was the only one with the problems or there were others but the symptoms were ambiguious, which left me on my own because few people shared my problems. I managed to solve some, and lived with the others. By troubleshooting on my own, I gained experience and was able to help people on Linux forums and here on Reddit. Additionally I know a bit of C and Py
