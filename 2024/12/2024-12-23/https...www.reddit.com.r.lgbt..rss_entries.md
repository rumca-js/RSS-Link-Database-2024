I study in an online school, and I was just wondering if placing my pronouns (they/theirs) at the end of emails to my teachers and classmates would be fine? I&#39;ve checked my school&#39;s policy and apparently they aim to support inclusivity in all forms, including gender. </p> <p>The issue is that I haven&#39;t come out to anyone in my school community yet, and was thinking of doing so indirectly by placing pronouns in my emails. Would this be a sensible idea, or should I try another way? </p> <p>Opinions please, thank you!!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SchoolSeparate3994"> /u/SchoolSeparate3994 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/1hknc2f/pronouns_in_email_signature/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/1hknc2f/pronouns_in_email_signature/">[comments]</a></span>

It genuinely baffles me when someone tells me that they’re straight. I mean it in the nicest way but wdym you don’t get attracted to just everyone and only limit it to one gender. Is this crazy of me to think? Well I guess you can’t choose to be straight, just how you can’t choose to be gay.
