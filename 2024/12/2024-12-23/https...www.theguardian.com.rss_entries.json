It is worth charting how things got here from the start of the war in Syria in 2012. During the conflict, the Democratic Union party (PYD) emerged as the biggest and most influential Kurdish political actor in Syria, taking territorial control in the north and maintaining an autonomous administration, albeit a fragile one.</p><p>The PYD\u2019s position is even more precarious after the HTS takeover. Turkey, emerging as the most influential foreign actor in Syria, is laser-focused on limiting any Kurdish push for autonomy domestically and regionally. Another challenge the PYD faces is that the HTS-led regime is very unlikely to tolerate existing Kurdish autonomy in Syria.</p><p>Dr Zeynep Kaya is a lecturer in international relations at the Universit",

The reason for this, according to the more plausible origin myths and etymology accepted by linguistic science, is the introduction to a Livornese tavern (possibly by a Turkish sea merchant) of a Turkish fish soup called <em>bal\u0131k \u00e7orbas\u0131</em>. The resourceful and quickly adopted recipe called for <em>k\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck</em> <em>bal\u0131k</em> (small fish), and <em>k\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck</em> was borrowed and became cacciucco.</p><p>However the soup came into being, a recipe made from an amalgam of fish had the most favourable environment in a thriving Tuscan seaport with its amalgam of communities, as well as in the arrival of tomatoes in everyday cooking, in the late 1700",
