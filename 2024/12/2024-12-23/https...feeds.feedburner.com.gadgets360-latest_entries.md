Researchers at the Fraunhofer Institute for Process Engineering and Packaging have successfully demonstrated how AI can identify the aromas and origins of whiskies with remarkable accuracy. By analysing the chemical compositions of 16 US and Scottish whiskies, the AI achieved over 90% accuracy in distinguishing between the two, surpassing human expert panels. The technology pinpointed key compounds linked to caramel and smoky notes. This study, published in Communications Chemistry, opens doors for applications in ensuring product consistency, detecting counterfeit whiskies, and even managing odours in other industries like recycled plastics. Further research is needed to address flavour changes during aging

A new biodegradable microbead has been developed as a potential replacement for plastic exfoliants in skincare products. These polymer-based beads break down into molecules resembling sugars and amino acids, making them environmentally safe. When tested on pig skin, the beads demonstrated superior performance in removing permanent marker and eyeliner compared to soap alone.
