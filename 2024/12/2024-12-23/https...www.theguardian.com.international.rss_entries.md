<p>Studying medicine is not an identity – and self-care should be considered a matter of medical ethics rather than an indulgence</p><p>After four long years of study, I wrapped up a medical degree this year. It’s been an adventure, and the downturn in activity post-exams has made me pensive. Way back in orientation week, an enthusiastic clinician noted that they still consider their time at medical school to be some of the best years of their life.</p><p>Reflecting on my own experience, I’ve begun to wonder whether that person needs to get out more.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/dec/24/heres-what-i-learned-in-medical-school-beyond-the-curriculum">Continue reading...</a>

<p>At a time when support for immigration is waning, the people of Stone Ridge, New York, adopted Afghan refugees – and helped them build a new life</p><p>Every third Thursday evening, an episcopal church in upstate New York transforms into an Afghan takeaway restaurant. It’s a “very foodie congregation”, says the Rev Marcella Gillis. The church does not charge the fledgling catering company overseen by Saida Faqirzada, a refugee from Kabul, for use of its gleaming commercial kitchen.</p><p>That decision, unsurprisingly, reminds Gillis of a familiar biblical parable. Several bystanders pass by a distressed person who has been mugged, who beaten up, robbed and left for dead. They say, “I’m not allowed to help them. I shouldn’t help them. Someone else will help them.” So they walk past.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/23/afghan-refugees-stone-ridge-community-support">Continue reading...</a>
