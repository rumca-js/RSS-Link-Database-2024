Pine Harbor is a survival horror game where the player is tasked with surviving in the eponymous town. A mysterious accident at a factory eventually leads to the entire town being abandoned, and the player finds themselves there in an attempt to reconnect with their father after getting a letter. 

The player quickly finds out, however, that something is deeply wrong with the town. The general gameplay in Pine Harbor revolves around hunting for supplies during the day, and surviving against aggressive enemies at night. The game borrows heavily from seminal horror titles like Silent Hill in terms of general atmosphere.

Unfortunately, the fact that it is an Early Access release means that there are quite a few problems with the title, ranging from bad quest design and terrible voice acting to generally boring gameplay owing to a lack of combat options.

Bloober Team’s Silent Hill 2 Remake is GamingBolt’s game of the year, beating stiff competition in the shape of Astro Bot, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, and Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree – and who would have thought it’d be such a success when Bloober were first announced as handling the remake?

The Polish studio have excelled by preserving the original’s persistently oppressive atmosphere, its stellar music and sound design, and its complex characters and emotional story arcs all whilst carefully adding their own personality beyond simply re-recording sound effects and enhancing graphics. 

This feature video the reasons why we believe Silent Hill 2 Remake is not only one of the best remakes of all time, but a worthy game of the year winner.
