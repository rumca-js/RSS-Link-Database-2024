<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>As the title suggests, I need feedback on the projects in my GitHub repo. I started to learn how to code a year ago and decided to go to school for computer science because I realized there is a very small chance of landing a tech job without an education. Any feedback from any of the projects on there would be greatly appreciated, thanks in advance! </p> <p>Here is my repo: <a href="https://GitHub.com/nexustech101/">https://GitHub.com/nexustech101/</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Icy_Presentation9229"> /u/Icy_Presentation9229 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1hjeutd/feedback_on_my_repo/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1hjeutd/feedback_on_my_repo/">[comments]</a></span>

## Seeking Guidance!üôè Hi, I'm a mid-level product designer, as a sidequest, trying to build this chrome extension. How complicated this would be to code, and is it possible to learn code & build this in a short time or help me assist in finding a roadmap to build this alone or with a coder! TQIA‚ù§Ô∏è
