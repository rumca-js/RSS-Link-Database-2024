As far as I remember he has stated he is gay, so i more-so understand the confusion, however i noticed this is a common things in relationships with bi men. If a straight relationship exists between a bi man who tends to be more feminine and a girl, many claim it to be a lavender relationship or that the man is a \u201cdl guy\u201d. </p> <p>Why is this? I myself have dated more feminine bi men and this was always the case with most people, there were always weird comments and looks from people thinking I was confused or that we were both faking our relationship.
