<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I just watched when harry met sally for the first time today, 35 years later and it is incredible, it’s so timeless and i know that is something special since I just watched the breakfast club last night and i thought it was a little outdated considering they’re both in the eighties , it has been a long time since I enjoyed a movie so thoroughly without feeling uncomfortable or bored for even a second, the acting was incredible, the chemistry between meg rayan and billy crystal was amazing, the script is so well done that i found myself engaging in their conversation even if I’m just a spectator, over all such a fantastic movie .</p> <p>Something I really want to talk about is sally’s character, you can not believe how much I love the way this character is portrayed, she is such a breath of fresh air, she holds herself with such dignity and femininity that is so powerful and beautiful, I resonate with her so much it’s so bizarre considering this movi

There could be an entire trilogy of material just set in WWII, and we could see Felix as a brand new OSS agent.</p> <p>The story has a defined enemy: Nazis. And a megalomaniac: Hitler. But to avoid counterfactualism, 007 should do a realistic intelligence gathering mission in Lisbon and occupied Paris. (Maybe he is tasked with something small but thinks he has a chance at assassinating Hitler and tries but misses and has to escape.)</p> <p>Then, there’s the whole second half of the 1940s to mine for good stories.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve seen plenty of people talk about how much they prefer the &quot;Mike survives&quot; ending, and having seen this movie in full over a dozen times, I could not disagree more strongly. </p> <p>For the purpose of simplicity, I will refer to the ending where Mike Enslin dies as the &quot;death ending&quot;. </p> <p>Here are two of the most common reasons to prefer the survival ending, with which I disagree on a fundamental level: </p> <pre><code> After decades of killing people, Mike Enslin deserves to be the one person who finally beats the Room. </code></pre> <p>Mike Enslin <em>did</em> beat the Room.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>It’s probably been about 10 years or so since I’ve seen this movie. They added it to Hulu and I was looking for something to watch while I work on some projects. </p> <p>DANG I totally forgot how many amazing actors they got for this film. Mark Wahlberg, Zoey Deschanel, John Leguizamo, and I was surprised to see Alan Ruck and Jeremy Strong too. </p> <p>The actors are soooo good but the dialogue is SO bad that it makes them all look like it’s their first time performing. And the story line is like… idk definitely interesting enough to keep you watching. It’s really my favorite combo. </p> <p>I find it hilarious that they keep some things out of view of the audience (people shooting themselves in the head) then 10 minutes later show a man voluntarily feeding his own arm to a lion. The direction is absolutely insane. </p> <p>Well worth a rewatch imo if you haven’t seen it in a while and are looking for something entertaining. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>One for me was a teen comedy/drama period piece set in the 60s about an all-boys high school called Heaven Help Us. A very sweet, underrated movie. Stars Andrew McCarthy. One of the major sub plots involves a brother/teacher in this religious school and he&#39;s abusive in a realistic way. It&#39;s disturbing. He enjoys the corporal punishment he inflicts on the students. </p> <p>As the movie nears the end... something happens where McCarthy finally fights back from the abuse and it&#39;s such a moment, such a rush for me I&#39;ve never forgotten that feeling.

## The most epic sci-fi movie ever partially-made is not for everyone, but you should watch it. Thoughts "On The Silver Globe" (1988)

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Story time. Back when I was a wee 18-year-old lad in 2008 I got my first job working in film and met a bunch of industry veterans who recommended a lot of unique movies and it just happened to be when Netflix was like 5 dollars a month to have 2 DVDs mailed a month and they had a broad selection of obscure movies. During this time I saw Fantastic Planet, El Topo, The Holy Mountain, Stalker, Come and See, 120 days of Sodom, Enter the Void, City of God, Kangaroo Jack, just incredible films (except that last one, lol) that were so unique and corrupted my innocent mind with devilishly brilliant new ideas about what a movie could be. But one in particular has haunted and fascinated me ever since. Let me warn you, On The Silver Globe from 1988 is a difficult watch on par with Come and See in just how horrifying and strange it is, but it&#39;s also worth watching because there will likely never be anything like it ever again. This is because it&#39;s an unf

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve recently watched The Manhattan Project (1986) for the first time. It was a movie I&#39;ve been meaning to watch for the longest time and finally got around to it.

It had the same vibe, wiz kid discovers something, builds or plays with it, and then eventually gets into trouble with the US Government/Military.</p> <p>Does anyone have any recommendations similar to WarGames and The Manhattan Project? Doesn&#39;t necessarily have to be made in the 80s but I think that&#39;s part of the charm. The whole Cold War-paranoia / nuclear war tension.</p> <p>P.S. WarGames still has an impressive movie set even to this day. The whole NORAD Commend Center set with WOPR is just amazing.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#
