## How come COSMIC has a fully functional Wayland compositor in such a short period?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>The road to Wayland has been slow and painful for GNOME and KDE and I&#39;ve been there all along the way for the past 8 years, but in a matter of a couple years and in its current alpha state, the COSMIC compositor is pretty much on parity with these, screenshare works, VRR is implemented, fractional scaling also, copy and paste works 100% of the time and to this day I still have drag and drop issues on Plasma pretty much breaking at random, but on COSMIC, it&#39;s working fine. It took several years for the other two leading desktops to tackle these features. Isn&#39;t this an actual amazing feat worth more recognition?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/neblustar"> /u/neblustar </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1hjizh9/how_come_cosmic_has_a_fully_functional_wayland/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1hjizh9/how_come_cos

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have tried installing Ubuntu ( then tried Arch) on my external HDD drive, making sure the ESP saved on a partition on this drive too. It boots fine with the laptop I used to install the OS to the drive, but not my work laptop.</p> <p>When I select to boot on the work laptop, it flicks a black screen for a tick and the select menu appears again, nothing changes. This happens on both Ubuntu and Arch. So I just wonder what could possibly be the reason. </p> <p>For context, both laptops use UEFI, one has Nvidia graphic, the other has Ryzen. I’m new to Linux so maybe h there are something I’m missing?
