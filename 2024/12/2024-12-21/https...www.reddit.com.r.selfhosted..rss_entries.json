The two most popular workarounds seem to be:</p> <ul> <li>Setting the proxy pass address to a variable</li> <li>Somehow faking the DNS record (via the hosts file or a custom DNS resolver [I did not look into these])</li> </ul> <p>I got it to work in my case using the variable workaround, but I\u2019m not particularly fond of it.

I connected it and got NUT to recognize it (something I had failed miserably at) and to top it off i was able to set up a script to shut down my server safely if the battery gets too low and even cooler (to me) I set it up so that my server would email me any time it goes into battery mode, connected or shut down.
