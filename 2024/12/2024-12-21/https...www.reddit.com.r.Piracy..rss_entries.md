## What pirated movie/cartoon website frequently updates their website by adding a new movie when it release and adds a new season of a cartoon once it releases?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’m looking for a reliable website that consistently updates its catalog with the latest releases. Specifically, I want a site that uploads new movies as soon as they release and adds full seasons of cartoons as soon as they drop. It’s hard to keep up with so many sites going down or changing domains, so I’m hoping someone here knows of a trusted source that stays on top of these updates.

I checked those on VT again and they gave me no positives. i proceded to directly download the file. i accidentally executed a &quot;adobe exe firewall block.bat&quot; file, and then executed the set up, <strong>which asked for windows permissions</strong>. Should i give permision to a cracked download? i don&#39;t think i would have permission to continue the download if i didn&#39;t. After the setup ended, the installation manual told me to close the app completely, shutting down the task in tsk manager as well</p> <p>
