Essentially all im trying to do is set up a door sensor with an alarm via bluetooth speaker. None of the code i try and enter works. I have followed tutorials for set up and semm to hit a wall with the gpio set up. When i try to install the python-rpi.gpio it says its not available and has no installation candidate. Have tried looking for answers but is kinda all gibberish to me. Can anyone help?
