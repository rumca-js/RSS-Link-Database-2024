<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>My subscription to the newsbin search engine has recently expired and before I renew, I wanted to ask if there are better alternatives. I have been using Usenet for years, but typically have been using the search service provided by either the Usenet provider or the one built into my client. I have a feeling there is something better our there than what I have been using. I would appreciate any feedback and reviews on the ones that work best.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/johje05"> /u/johje05 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1hj0mco/best_search_for_usenet/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1hj0mco/best_search_for_usenet/">[comments]</a></span>
