<p>On Sunday, aged 39, Sevilla’s Jesús Navas brings down the curtain on Spanish football’s most glittering career</p><p>A little after 9am in Montequinto, Seville, and Jesús Navas walks past the Jesús Navas Stadium and up the little slope in the sunshine, gym to the left, training pitch to the right. The first to arrive and he’s moving OK this morning, which isn’t something he can say every day, but still he comes. Soon, too soon, he won’t. “It’s my life,” he says, “what I’ve always done, who I am.” The stand bearing his name wasn’t here when he first turned up, a quarter of a century ago. Most of this wasn’t; the trophies at the Estadio Ramón Sánchez Pizjuán, three miles north, certainly weren’t. Everything changes, except him. “I’m the same as the first day,” he says.</p><p>That day, Navas was 15, a small, skinny, shy boy from Los Palacios, 15 minutes south. It was 2000 and he has been coming almost every morning since, apart from four seasons in Manchester which he enjoyed more ev

<p>This was almost the perfect way for Mikel Arteta to celebrate five years as Arsenal manager. Another two goals for Gabriel Jesus – his first in the Premier League since January – followed up his match-winning performance against the same opponents a few days ago as Kai Havertz, Gabriel Martinelli and the substitute Declan Rice with his first league goal of the season rounded off another victory over Crystal Palace.</p><p>Only the sight of Bukayo Saka limping off during the first half with a suspected hamstring injury could dampen the enthusiasm of the travelling supporters, whose side are now only three points behind the leaders, Liverpool – albeit having played two games more. But with Manchester City six points behind Arsenal and almost a speck of dust in their rearview mirror, Arteta will know they have never had a better opportunity to go all the way after clinically ­dispatching Oliver Glasner’s side.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/dec/21/crystal-palac

<p><strong>Royal Opera House; Hackney Church, London</strong><br>Ukrainian soprano Olga Kulchynska is an unforgettable Mimì in Richard Jones’s ever sumptuous Puccini production. And mischief rules at this year’s LCMF</p><p>Oranges! Dates! Hot chestnuts! Nougat!

Hawkers hawk, crowds shove, infants demand, in massed chorus. Together or alone, they greet the season against a backdrop of Paris, city of light, chimneys, smoke, wealth, poverty. The second act of this 1896 opera is a miracle of moving parts, dramatically and musically. Children and marching band bump heads with lovers at war and lovers – Rodolfo and Mimì – newly in love.</p><p>Few productions match Richard Jones’s for the Royal Opera, designed by Stewart Laing, with lighting by Mimi Jordan Sherin,

<p>As a foreign correspondent, home was never a fixed location. I’ve finally learned it’s about who you share it with</p><ul><li>In our end of year series, writers and public figures remember the place or time when they felt most at home</li></ul><p>The first time it happened I wrote it off as inexperience. By “it” I mean lying on a concrete floor covered in cow shit and wondering how many bones had been broken by the cow I’d been trying to milk. Great skill is needed for the apparently simple task of attaching suction cups to a cow’s teats – especially if she has painful warts.</p><p>The cows hated me (rightly so) and I hated them. Maybe I mean feared rather than hated, but it amounts to the same thing. And the more experienced I became, the more I was forced to admit that my idea of a farm in Wales becoming the home I had always longed for was ill advised if not utterly stupid.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/dec/21/farm-bought-sold-home-new-york">Contin

<p>Fried rice in a moreish garlic and spring onion sauce, and an excellent way to use up cheeseboard scraps, crackers and all</p><p>With the Christmas menu largely planned, we can now all admit that the thing we <em>really</em> love about the festivities is the time after the day itself. Expectations return to planet normal and most of us revert to cooking much as we do for the rest of the year: a fridge raid here, a stir-fry there, home-cooked meals served up to friends and family who are more than happy just to be fed. So this is a time when cooking with food that has already been cooked feels like the biggest win of all. With most of the work pretty much done, it’s often just a case of assembly, stirring and reheating. Entertaining the easy way.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/dec/21/yotam-ottolenghi-recipes-for-christmas-leftovers-cheesy-gratin-and-garlicky-fried-rice">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Few Premier League players divide opinion like the Chelsea striker but his scoring record stands up to scrutiny</p><p><strong>By Matt Furniss for <a href="https://theanalyst.com/">Opta Analyst</a></strong></p><p>Football is a game of opinions, but Tim Sherwood could maybe do with analysing the data before stating his. Speaking as a pundit on an international broadcast following Chelsea’s win over Brentford on Sunday, Sherwood declared that “at times [Nicolas Jackson] looks like someone playing in Soccer Aid who’s not a footballer.”</p><p>It’s fair to say that Jackson has divided opinion more than most players since arriving in the Premier League in the summer of 2023. The Senegal striker displayed raw talent in his 18 months in the first team at Spanish top-flight club Villarreal.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/dec/21/nicolas-jackson-chelsea-goals-analysis">Continue reading...</a>

<p>More than 80 countries – more than half the world’s population – voted this year in elections that could be pivotal for democracy</p><p><a href="https://anchorchange.substack.com/p/different-approaches-to-counting">More than 80 countries headed to the polls in 2024</a>, including some of the wealthiest and most powerful, the most populous, the most authoritarian and the most fragile. Many votes tested the limits of democracy, while others were exercises in rubber-stamping. Some were boycotted by the opposition or undermined by government crackdowns on press and dissenters. We kept track of all the results with our election tracker:</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/23/2024-global-elections-tracker-voting-dates-us-india-indonesia-belarus-haiti-pakistan-full-list">Continue reading...</a>
