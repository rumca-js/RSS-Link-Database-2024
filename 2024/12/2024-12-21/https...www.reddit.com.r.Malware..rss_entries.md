<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I hope it&#39;s the right forum for this. My grandfather&#39;s Galaxy S20 keeps making &#39;snap&#39; sounds that sound like screenshots (but are not quite). It&#39;s also not any notification, there are none when it happens. I can&#39;t figure out a pattern or a way to reproduce it, seems to be random, every 5 minutes or so, sometimes one after another.</p> <p>ChatGPT said to check camera permissions for anything suspicious but nothing came up. Neither in Accessiblity permissions. He&#39;s a very careful and naturally suspicious person, he rarely downloads weird things and always wants me to delete as many unnecessary Apps as possible.</p> <p>I&#39;m a developer, so i can get a bit technical if you suggest some things to check out. Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/-Pinkaso"> /u/-Pinkaso </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Malware/comments/1hjbe0r/phone_keeps_making_snap_sou
