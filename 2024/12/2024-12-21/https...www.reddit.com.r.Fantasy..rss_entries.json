It greatly expanded and fleshed out the world he presented in The Blacktongue Thief and I really appreciate his ability to adopt completely different tones in his books to best fit the characters POV. </p> <p>Apart from that I really enjoyed The Will of The Many from James Islington, served as a great starting point for a new Series and I\u2019m excited to see where he goes with it. I can\u2019t explain why but I got the same feeling reading it as Codex Alera gave me when I first read it many years ago!</p> <p>Happy holidays to you all!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.re",

She says it gets better but even the world building is slow, boring, and uninteresting. Can anyone give me hope that it gets better? And even if it does.... that many freaking books pumped out so quickly? Just not feeling there&#39;s a lot of substance here. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/LLawliet95\"> /u/LLawliet95 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1hiz9kw/throne_of_glass/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1hiz9kw/throne_of_glass/\">[comments]</a></span>",

It\u2019s a market that I managed to get in on the ground floor before the MCU managed to make it explode. There\u2019s a benefit to superhero novels that aren\u2019t often brought up and it\u2019s the fact that the stories can have a beginning, middle, and end in a way that larger named franchised ones don\u2019t. The rules of each supervillain world can also be dictated by the author as well, emphasizing or changing the rules so it may be a magical or technology-based world.</p> <p>Here are my favorite superhero novels that I\u2019ve enjoyed and things that have served as inspirations to my own work. I\u2019ve tried to keep a balance of traditional and indie published works.</p> <p><strong>10] The Case of the Claw by Keith R.A. DeCandido</strong></p> <p>Review",

Everything I read has to either connect to something I\u2019m already invested in or be heavily hyped through word of mouth from people I trust. I dont know how to just give a piece of media a chance. How do you all find stuff, especially new stuff that doesnt already have a large fandom attached? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Zoe_the_redditor\"> /u/Zoe_the_redditor </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1hixi6e/how_do_you_know_what_to_read/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1hixi6e/how_do_you_know_what_to_read/\">[comments]</a></span>",
