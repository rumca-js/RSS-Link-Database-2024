<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Recently with the Brad Mondo “drama(?)” going on, I’ve noticed a lot of comments stating how it has to be a publicity stunt. As far as I remember he has stated he is gay, so i more-so understand the confusion, however i noticed this is a common things in relationships with bi men. If a straight relationship exists between a bi man who tends to be more feminine and a girl, many claim it to be a lavender relationship or that the man is a “dl guy”. </p> <p>Why is this? I myself have dated more feminine bi men and this was always the case with most people, there were always weird comments and looks from people thinking I was confused or that we were both faking our relationship.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>A few days ago, my family and I had a random conversation about things like dating, crushes, and similar stuff. My younger brother (13 M) told my parents he have a crush, but it&#39;s not who they think his crush is (this is how it started).</p> <p>Then my (I&#39;m a 16-year-old NB AFAB) mother asked if I had a bf or liked anyone from my uni.</p> <p>Here&#39;s the thing, I&#39;m Bi and even though I am usually into boys, I&#39;m utterly <strong><em>disgusted</em></strong> by the majority of the boys in my country (Sri Lanka) I meet in my day-to-day life. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I don&#39;t have men or anything- it&#39;s just that these boys or men ik are full of shit...

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Speaking as a bisexual man, it’s frankly baffling to watch from the sidelines.</p> <p>Seriously, that old homophobic trope of the “aggressive wife-beating lesbian” and that misleading statistic about domestic abuse amongst lesbian couples keeps getting thrown around like it’s a fact, and it’s… genuinely very uncomfortable to watch so-called “leftists” unironically cite that to excuse their lesbophobia. </p> <p>Like, anyone citing AIDS or something of that nature to discriminate against gay men would be, nine times out of ten, recognised as homophobic. So why isn’t this statistic recognised as that too ?</p> <p>Another thing - there’s this really weird fake Reddit story I’ve seen recently, where a lesbian woman with cancer falls in love with her male best friend (who is portrayed as… pretty stalkerish, ngl). </p> <p>Thing is, first of all, it’s obviously fake- it’s written like a shitty romance novel and it’s clear that the author hasn’t so much as se

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>There are men who are strongly attracted to twinks, and it&#39;s not uncommon for older men, sometimes over 30, to exclusively seek sexual relationships with them.</p> <p>From my own experience, I view this behavior critically. When I was 18, I had sex with men who were much older than me.</p> <p>Looking back now, at 26, I realize how little I knew about relationships, sexuality, or self-protection at the time. I was naïve and immature, and these older men took advantage of that - whether consciously or not.</p> <p>Even if both sides consent - an 18-year-old who is into older men and an older man who is into twinks - I still find these encounters problematic. The power dynamics are unbalanced: the older man has more life experience, often knows better how to assert himself in such situations, while the younger one is still in a phase of self-discovery.</p> <p>Sometimes I wonder if this fixation on 18-year-old twinks reflects a form of pedophilic tend

I can lean on my friends at school who are also in the closet, but I cant be with them 24/7. I have a &quot;friend&quot; at school also (she&#39;s really my girlfriend we just pretend to be friends because her parents are homophobes too). I&#39;m also a furry and my dad kinda hates me for it. I just feel like the people who are closest to me will never accept me the way I am. While I am a Christian, I think if Jesus met an LGBT, he would love them equally and respect their sexuality and pronouns.

But she had been moody, cranky etc. I was waiting for her to tell me and I thought I was being supportive and open. Something happened and we had a disagreement and it came out. She admitted that she was waiting for me to ask, that she feels scared and lonely and like she’s hiding. I apologized for not being what she needed but said I do support her because I love her. Now what? Do I tell my husband? Do I ask her if she wants me to tell him? I’m not freaked out at all but just don’t quite know how to navigate this. She brought up family, religion, society everything. It was like a bomb went off but I’m glad it finally did!
