<p>Craig Calcaterra, writing at Cup of Coffee:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To say this is a massive loss is about as big an understatement as
is possible. Henderson was the biggest and brightest star of his
generation. There may not have been any player in history who was
better at more things than Rickey Henderson was.</p>

<p>Henderson was, without question, the greatest leadoff hitter of
all time and the greatest base-stealer of all time. He, arguably,
possessed the greatest combination of power and speed of any
player in the history of the game as well. Perhaps the best
characterization of Henderson’s career came from Bill James who
once wrote that, “if you could split Rickey Henderson in two,
you’d have two Hall of Famers.” [...]</p>

<p>In 1980, his first full major league season, Henderson broke Ty
Cobb’s 65-year-old American League record for stolen bases by
swiping 100 bags to Cobb’s 96. In 1982 he stole 130 bases,
breaking Hall of Famer Lou Brock’s all-time single-season record
