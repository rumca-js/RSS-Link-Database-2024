<p class="has-text-align-none">A great thriller lives and dies by its complexity. Movies like <em>All the President’s Men</em> or <em>Blow Out</em> create intricate, detailed worlds of mystery that pull you in before leaving you at the center of the labyrinth to unwind yourself in the days that follow. A solid B-tier thriller, however, is all about simplicity. These are movies like <em>Taken</em> and <em>Phone Booth</em> that you might not necessarily choose to put on, but never say no to if you find them on cable. What makes these movies so fun, and so endlessly rewatchable, is how effectively they wring every last drop of mystery and tension out of a deceptively simple premise. And <em>Carry-On</em>

<p class="has-drop-cap has-text-align-none">Years ago, comedy writer Mike McMahan got the opportunity of a lifetime — an interview to join the writing staff of a new Star Trek<em> </em>series, the first in over a decade. McMahan was a massive Trekkie and had recently made a splash with a parody Twitter account called “<a href="https://x.com/TNG_S8">TNG Season 8</a>,” in which he summarized goofy, imaginary episodes of <em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/22924014/star-trek-discovery-character-emotions">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a></em>. He’d even sold the idea t

<p class="has-text-align-none">One of the standout moments of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/review/498909/sonic-3-movie-review"><em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</em></a> sees Jim Carrey pulling double duty as two Doctors Robotnik —&nbsp;Ivo and his grandfather Gerald —&nbsp;merrily dancing their way through a classic Hollywood trope: the laser security grid. That sequence was not only technically challenging to pull off, <em>Sonic 3</em> director Jeff Fowler tells Polygon, it was a scene proposed by Carrey himself — which sure sounds like a thing Jim Carrey would do.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We’re more than halfway through December, which means 2025 is right around the corner with a whole new slate of new movies to look forward to. Before that, though, there are still plenty of decent sci-fi films to watch on Netflix this month to tide you over until the new year!</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This month, we’ve got a Michael Bay action thriller about transforming robots that sparked an entire cinematic franchise, a rough and rowdy cyberpunk thriller starring Logan Marshall-Green, and a cult-classic pulp adventure set in an alternate 1930s universe filled with giant flying robots!</p>
