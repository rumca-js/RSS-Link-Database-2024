Ben interviews Bishop Robert Barron, bishop of the Diocese of Winona-Rochester, about the Christmas season. Christmas has become a secularized and commercialized holiday as well as a cultural phenomenon instead of a religious one. There’s been a loss of the importance of Christmas day, and Bishop Barron wants to recover the real religious heart of Christmas. This year, Hanukkah and Christmas fall at the same time. Ben and Bishop Barron talk about the ties that Hanukkah has to Christmas in biblical terms. Lastly, Bishop Barron leaves us with the big message of Christmas this year: The light conquers the darkness.
