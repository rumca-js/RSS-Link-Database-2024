<p>They were 95 minutes into the battle that been built as the clash that would decide the title, the final seconds slipping away, when a man who looks for all the world like a norse warrior delivered the decisive blow. Atlético Madrid had suffered, they had resisted and, in truth, they had probably longed for that final whistle to go, and then suddenly Alexander Sørloth thumped in another late winner. In doing so he sent Atlético Madrid top the table at Christmas and their coach, staff and subs sprinting onto the pitch.</p><p>Barcelona’s fans meanwhile turned and headed straight for the exit, unable to believe what had just happened. What had happened was this: on a night when they had hit the bar and had more than enough chances to win it, including deep into added time, in which Jan Oblak, the goalkeeper had been the best player on the pitch, with Pedri, they had somehow been beaten. It is the third time in a row that they have lost here in La Liga and first time they have ever fa

<p></p><p>On the shortest day of the year, a game that burst only briefly into life. In the space of seven second-half minutes, from nothing and nowhere, things started to happen. Brighton took the lead. West Ham equalised. And then things stopped happening again.</p><p>There were, to be fair, some rousing moments in the closing stages. Crysencio Summerville, a second-half substitute, robbed the ball off Jan Paul van Hecke and sprinted towards the area, but his shot was blocked; Yankuba Minteh, another, was played through on the right and eventually slid the ball across goal where Vladimir Coufal, a third, running back to defend his goal, deflected it into the foot of the far post. And finally, in the fourth minute of stoppage time and with Brighton finishing strongly, Evan Ferguson, a fourth, set up Yasin Ayari, a fifth, for a shot that was well saved. But the primary impression will be of two teams that started a hectic rush of festive fixtures as if their primary motivation was to

<p>Sir Bobby Robson adored both of these clubs but, in their first Premier League meeting since his passing, it was Newcastle whose display would have made the old master’s eyes twinkle. This was, put bluntly, men against boys and the away side would not have been flattered by a heavier win.

<p>For the past decade, the Barcelona-based visual artist <a href="https://xavibou.com/">Xavi Bou</a> has devoted his work to revealing “the hidden beauty of natural movement”. His initial focus was birds; now he’s moved on to insects. In collaboration with US entomologist Adrian Smith he’s created an eye-popping series that captures – by merging multiple frames into a single image – the rhythmic flutterings of butterflies and chaotic leaps of spittlebugs and treehoppers. As well as their beauty, Bou was struck by the crucial role that insects play in ecosystems, even as their numbers plummet – it’s estimated that the biomass of flying insect species has decreased by 75% over the past 27 years. “We need to move beyond seeing insects as mere nuisances,” says Bou. “They are fascinating, essential creatures, and we owe them a great deal.” </p><ul><li><a href="https://xavibou.com/">See more of Xavi Bou’s images here</a></li></ul> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/

<p>It is often a neglected space but the hallway is the backbone of any property and can set the mood for the whole home</p><p>Of all the rooms in the home, the hallway is arguably the most neglected. There are several reasons for this, but top of the list is that many people scoff at the very idea that a hallway is a room in its own right. Often it is seen as little more than a necessary linking corridor, one that invariably doubles as a dumping ground for coats, shoes, unopened post and the other detritus of everyday life. But any design expert will insist that a room it most certainly is and it deserves as much thought as any other – particularly since it gives the first impression of your home. ​​</p><p>“Hallways are the backbone of any property and can really set the mood for the whole home,” explains interior designer Pandora Taylor. “People struggle to understand the identity of their hallway, because it doesn’t have an obvious purpose, like a dining room, where you might crea

<p>Almost 20 years since their last outing, the cheese-loving inventor and his ever-dependable dog resume battle with a feathered fiend in this precision-tooled caper</p><p>After last year’s slightly lacklustre <em>Chicken Run</em> sequel, <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/dec/10/chicken-run-dawn-of-the-nugget-review-sequel-aardman-animations">Dawn of the Nugget</a></em>, it seemed as though Aardman’s hitherto peerless standards might be slipping a tad. But those fears, I am happy to report, were unfounded. The latest feature from the Bristol-based animation studio is an absolute delight. Directed by Nick Park and Merlin Crossingham, <em>Vengeance Most Fowl</em> – featuring crackpot inventor Wallace (Ben Whitehead) and his long-suffering canine chum, Gromit – revisits the tried-and-tested Aardman formula: affable absurdity combined with precision-tooled comic timing and a selection of deliciously silly jokes about cheese.</p><p>It’s just shy of 20 years since Wallace

<p>Happy Christmas, Pep. For Manchester City and Guardiola, this was another painful destruction, an unthinkable ninth defeat in 12 matches for a team who have flipped from formidable to fragile and flat. City have now lost six of their past eight Premier League matches, as many as they gave up en route to the title in 2020-21, the worst of their championship-winning seasons. They could end the weekend as low as ninth.</p><p>Guardiola, in a long black cloak and boots, wandered over to the increasingly bewildered away fans. Then came a deep puff of the cheeks. These are hard times. For Unai Emery and Villa, this was another triumph, Jhon Durán and Morgan Rogers scoring fine goals to overpower the visitors.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/dec/21/aston-villa-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Researchers in North Carolina used underwater sonar to map a system created by enslaved people centuries ago</p><p>As a former deputy state underwater archaeologist, Mark Wilde-Ramsing can’t help but look down. While rowing around North Carolina’s Eagles Island, at the tip of the Gullah Geechee corridor, he noticed signs of human-made structures, visible at low tide. Though he’d retired, he was still active in the field and knew his former agency hadn’t recorded the structures – which meant he had come across something previously undocumented. The next step was figuring out exactly what he’d found.</p><p>Wilde-Ramsing knew the area had once been full of rice fields. His neighbor, Joni “Osku” Backstrom, was an assistant professor in the department of environmental sciences at the University of North Carolina-Wilmington whose specialty was shallow-water sonar, and he had the skills and technology to explore the area. Using a sonar device, the duo detected 45 wooden structures in the

<p>Frozen or tinned spinach is the key to a rich, silky store-cupboard dish that’s best enjoyed with rice or flatbreads</p><p>I’ll let you into a secret that every Indian home cook already knows: frozen or tinned spinach makes for the best <em>saag</em>. For a start, there’s not as much water to cook out as there is with fresh spinach, and it breaks down into that gorgeous, oozy-delicious emerald mass more easily than fresh spinach does. Also, there is a general lightening of the human spirit that comes from making something nearly entirely from the freezer or store cupboard (well, it does for me, anyway).

Suppose the roughly four-fifths of Ukrainian territory still controlled by Kyiv gets military commitments from the west strong enough to deter any further Russian advances, secure large-scale investment in economic reconstruction, encourage Ukrainians to return from abroad to rebuild their country, and allow for stable, pro-European politics and reform. In five years, the country joins the EU, and then, under a new US administration, starts the process of entering Nato. Most of Ukraine becomes a sovereign, independent, free country, firmly

<p>Growing numbers of former top-flight footballers are prolonging their playing days down the pyramid. Two of them explain why</p><p>Once the floodlights fade, most professional footballers are lost to the game, a small percentage moving into coaching, a profession as ruthless as playing.

A considerable amount never kick a ball again, unable to repeat or unwilling to relive their playing days.</p><p>It is also far less common to see older players drop down the leagues than it was a generation ago.

<p>December gardening jobs can be thin on the ground, so all the more reason to relax and reflect</p><p>Depending on when you’re reading this, the year may just have turned: the winter solstice in the UK takes place at 9.19am on Saturday 21 December. We are shifting out of the darkness. There’s actually something of a pause before daylight starts gradually stretching out again – as Katherine May points out in her perennial bestseller Wintering, sunrise and sunset remain the same for a few days. “The original meaning is revealed in the Latin etymology of the word solstice: <em>sol stit</em>. The sun has stopped,” May wrote.</p><p>Traditionally, I’ve clung on to the winter solstice with equal, if not more fervour than Christmas. January may be bleak and riddled with bossy instructions to self-improve but at least the days are getting longer. More daylight means more time in the garden and more light for the plants. The early harbingers of spring – snowdrops, witch hazel blossom, the he

With a sailor for a husband, you kind of have to be if you want to see them more than once every two months. Antigua with a baby hurling all the way? No problem. Dubai with three under-fives? Bring it. It usually required pre-Maria Captain Von Trapp levels of whistling, but was generally worth it. Until I overreached.</p><p>Christmas 2016: I had three small kids, a parent in hospital in Scotland and a husband working in France.
