And mischief rules at this year\u2019s LCMF</p><p>Oranges! Dates! Hot chestnuts! Nougat! Whipped cream! \u2013 to name only the most enticing treats on offer in the Latin Quarter on Christmas Eve, as depicted by Puccini in <strong><a href=\"https://www.rbo.org.uk/tickets-and-events/la-boheme-details\">La boh\u00e8me</a></strong>. Hawkers hawk, crowds shove, infants demand, in massed chorus. Together or alone, they greet the season against a backdrop of Paris, city of light, chimneys, smoke, wealth, poverty. The second act of this 1896 opera is a miracle of moving parts, dramatically and musically. Children and marching band bump heads with lovers at war and lovers \u2013 Rodolfo and Mim\u00ec \u2013 newly in love.</p><p>Few productions match Richard Jones\u2019s for the Royal Opera, designed by Stewart Laing, with lighting by Mimi Jordan Sherin,",

Expectations return to planet normal and most of us revert to cooking much as we do for the rest of the year: a fridge raid here, a stir-fry there, home-cooked meals served up to friends and family who are more than happy just to be fed. So this is a time when cooking with food that has already been cooked feels like the biggest win of all.
