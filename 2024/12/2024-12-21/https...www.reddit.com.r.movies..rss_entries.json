Back when I was a wee 18-year-old lad in 2008 I got my first job working in film and met a bunch of industry veterans who recommended a lot of unique movies and it just happened to be when Netflix was like 5 dollars a month to have 2 DVDs mailed a month and they had a broad selection of obscure movies. During this time I saw Fantastic Planet, El Topo, The Holy Mountain, Stalker, Come and See, 120 days of Sodom, Enter the Void, City of God, Kangaroo Jack, just incredible films (except that last one, lol) that were so unique and corrupted my innocent mind with devilishly brilliant new ideas about what a movie could be. But one in particular has haunted and fascinated me ever since. Let me warn you, On The Silver Globe from 1988 is a difficult watch on par with Come and See in just how horrifying and strange it is, but it&#39;s also worth watching because there will likely never be anything like it ever again.
