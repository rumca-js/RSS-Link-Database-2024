<p>A federal judge in California has agreed with WhatsApp that the NSO Group, the Israeli cybersurveillance firm behind the Pegasus spyware, had hacked into its systems by sending malware through its servers to thousands of its users&#39; phones. WhatsApp and its parent company, Meta, <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-30-facebook-sues-nso-group.html">sued the NSO Group</a> back in 2019 and accused it of spreading malware to 1,400 mobile devices across 20 countries with surveillance as its purpose. They revealed back then some of the targeted phones were owned by journalists, human rights activists, prominent female leaders and political dissidents. <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/12/20/whatsapp-meta-nso-pegasus-hacking-spyware/?pwapi_token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJyZWFzb24iOiJnaWZ0IiwibmJmIjoxNzM0NjcwODAwLCJpc3MiOiJzdWJzY3JpcHRpb25zIiwiZXhwIjoxNzM2MDUzMTk5LCJpYXQiOjE3MzQ2NzA4MDAsImp0aSI6I
