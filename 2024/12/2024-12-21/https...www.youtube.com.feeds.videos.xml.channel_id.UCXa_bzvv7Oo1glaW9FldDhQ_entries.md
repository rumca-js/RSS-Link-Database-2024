Supernatural is a survival horror game that revolves around a detective looking into the mystery of a missing housemaid in a seemingly haunted house. 

The game’s core feature revolves around making use of the player’s microphone to not only adjust how scary the game gets, but to also interact with the antagonistic supernatural entity that seems to be roaming the house’s hallways.

In practice, while getting the microphone to work can be a finicky experience for some, Supernatural offers up a fun couple of hours for fans of the horror genre. While the game won’t have players going guns blazing against hordes of zombies, it will definitely have players on the edge of their seats thanks to gorgeous visuals and some excellent sound design - aspects that often tend to be make-or-break for horror games.

Open-world games are an interesting genre. With the right gameplay loop and design, they can offer some of the most expansive experiences in gaming. If things go wrong, you're looking at a slog that annoys people and ultimately makes the world feel like work rather than something organic and worthy of exploration.

Though this year hasn't had the most top-tier releases - to say nothing of the titles that fizzled out - it's offered some pretty top-tier open-world games like Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree, Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, Dragon's Dogma 2, and Satisfactory. There have also been some great efforts in semi-open world space like Black Myth: Wukong's larger areas.

Which are the best ones from 2024 that are worth playing? Find out as we run through our 20 picks for the best open-world and semi-open-world games.
