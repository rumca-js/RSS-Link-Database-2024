He was never great at it, but he has a PS5, and he&#39;s stumbled his way through most of the big titles like God of War, Wolfenstein, TLOU, ect. Then, a year and a half ago, he was diagnosed with Parkinson&#39;s. It affects his hands pretty badly, to the point where he&#39;s starting to struggle to button shirts and stuff. His memory also isn&#39;t great, though he won&#39;t admit to having signs of dementia. Are there any games I can get him that either have really good accessibility features or really simple gameplay mechanics so that he can still get the joy and sense of accomplishment that you can get from beating a game? These days, he spends a lot of time staring blankly at the TV. He&#39;s lost a lot of the physical activities that he used to enjoy, and I don&#39;t want him to lose gaming too if we can avoid it.</p> <p>Thanks, and Happy Holidays!</p> ",

The sale that ends in 6 hrs or so to find what ever in that sale is only available now in \u201cAll deals\u201d page and the Holiday sale is the Big one advertised now! I started using the wishlist button for things I may purchase before each sale ends if there is any at the time. But why do they just toss it aside for the new sales?? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/doorbell19\"> /u/doorbell19 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1hizdy1/playstation_weekly_sales_should_stay_on_the_main/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1hizdy1/playstation_weekly_sales_should_stay_on_the_main/\">[comments]</a></span>",
