The only thoughts I could think was that she didn&#39;t want to acknowledge her feelings or she didn&#39;t want her mom to see it and make her feel disappointed (just like she hid her cookbook).

Yet, he leaves breadcrumbs of sources and ideas if you want to go deeper.</p> <p>I\u2019m translating the excerpts from French to English, so bear with me.</p> <p>The book begins with a sharp observation: \u201cFor most people, the essential problem of love is to be loved, rather than to love.\u201d He goes on to say, \u201cPeople think that loving is easy, and that what\u2019s difficult is finding the right object to love.\u201d These lines struck a chord with me because so much of what Fromm wrote aligned perfectly with beliefs I already held ab",

This book posits Jim as highly intelligent and well-spoken. He uses slave speak in front of white people because he knows it&#39;s safer if they think he&#39;s an idiot. Awesome premise!</p> <p>What confuses me is how well educated Jim is. He&#39;s not just smart; he&#39;s knowledgeable. He knows about Voltaire and Rousseau. He&#39;s incredibly eloquent with an amazing vocabulary, and no explanation has been provided thus far about how he gained all this knowledge.</p> <p>It isn&#39;t realistic that he would be so well educated.
