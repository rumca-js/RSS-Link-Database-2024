My brother and his friend came up with the idea to open a cartridge rental business for the Dendy console (essentially the NES for the post-Soviet market). They got the idea after seeing Dendy commercials on TV. My brother wasn’t much of a gamer himself, but he was definitely into making money. By then, consoles were slowly appearing in our city, but renting cartridges? That was something new.</p> <p>The rental concept was inspired by my brother’s friend,

Since then, I have bought two more SNES consoles. While they work on my TV, the screen is darker than it should be and it makes it hard to play games. I have tried connecting both SNES consoles to three different TVs (one large smart TV, one small smart TV, and one old Vizio flat TV). All three TVs display the darker screen. I also tried using the original RGB wires as well as an inverter, but all combinations produce the same exact darker screen.</p> <p>Here&#39;s the kicker: when I purchased my most recent SNES, I asked the previous owner to confirm it works on his TV (which was a flat screen smart TV). It worked perfectly with no discoloring issues at all. I used the same exact wires that he did on my TVs at home but suddenly the screen is darker.</p> <p>I am currently waiting for my Rad2x to a

Simply because I have never done it before. I am sure there are gamers out there who would have scored better with one life.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This is something that I have always been interested in learning about as back in the late 80s, games in Japan could be super gory as there were games like Splatterhouse as it was a game that had a lot of gore depicted.</p> <p>But then as games like Resident Evil would emerge in the 90s, suddenly video games in Japan would face heavy edits as the first one had very violent imagery, but the second one was heavily altered in Japan, although the North American version had way more gore somehow.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/KaleidoArachnid"> /u/KaleidoArachnid </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1hj0d27/what_caused_video_games_in_japan_to_receive_heavy/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1hj0d27/what_caused_video_games_in_japan_to_receive_heavy/">[comments]</a></span>
