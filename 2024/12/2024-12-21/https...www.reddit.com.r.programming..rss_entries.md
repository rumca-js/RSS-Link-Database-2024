<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Ok, so I have a bachelor&#39;s degree in web development, and of course, as a web developer, you&#39;ll be forced into the mainstream software that I call &quot;complexity hell,&quot; which includes one of the stupidest languages of all time: React. You can do everything in React that you can do in plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and you have much more control over it in the native languages, especially when you implement the server-side part with something like Node.js. In my opinion, React overcomplicates everything, creating a redundancy hellscape, and the readability is also horrible with all the unnecessary imports you have to deal with.</p> <p>Here are the main complaints about the main &quot;features&quot; of React:</p> <ol> <li><p>Components: The idea is to make certain areas of your code reusable. This becomes obsolete with a simple copy-past (ctrl+c, ctrl+v).( It&#39;s pretty decent for larger projects, but it can still get unreadable.)</p
