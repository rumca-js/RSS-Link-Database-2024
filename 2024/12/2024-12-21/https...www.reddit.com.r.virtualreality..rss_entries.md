<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Ok, just thought would share my experience as I have been absolutely pulling my hair out trying to fix awful performance in this game. Running PSVR2 with PC adapter, I’ve got a 4090 and 13700k. </p> <p>Absolutely nothing I tried worked - stuttering was unbearable even on lowest settings and resolution. Finally, I realized my XMP profile had been disabled in bios for some reason - my RAM was only running at 2666mhz. After enabling XMP and bumping to 3600mhz, HUGE bump in performance. </p> <p>I only had 16 gb in my system (1 stick died and I hadn’t gotten around to replacing it). Decided to run to microcenter this afternoon and grab 32GB. After throwing that in my system and enabling XMP to 3600, the game runs smooth as butter.</p> <p>This is the first time I’ve ever encountered such a severe bottleneck from RAM alone. Hope this helps someone who just wants to blast Xenos in peace!!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I used to own an Index. Loved it when it was set up, but after having moved I dreaded to set up all the stuff with the base stations and the giant wire bundle again, and since I don&#39;t play VR that often I decided to sell it. Now, the index is about 6ish years old now, and a lot has happened in the world of VR, especially in terms of wireless...ness.</p> <p>My question is, as someone who could not care any less about the &quot;standalone&quot; experience, &quot;ecosystems&quot; and whatnot:<br/> What is currently the best choice if I want to use the device with my PC, while also being wireless (or at least only relying on one cable) and ideally not relying on external trackers? So far I am eyeing the Quest 3 and the Pico 4 Ultra, but all reviews that I am finding in regards to PCVR are pitting the Quest 3 against the Pico 4 Non-Ultra.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/VatuuKomalia"> /u/VatuuK

## Which is more important for playing flatscreen games in VR, core count or 3D V-Cache?

I&#39;m talking about literally playing flatscreen games in vr using software such as gameVRoom, bigscreen, virtual desktop, etc... Intuitively, I would think core count would be more important considering you&#39;re essentially running 2 games at the same time.

## Hyperdash is Underrated

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hyperdash vr in my opinion is one of the most underrated vr games currently on the market, which is especially surprising given the fact that its one of the few free games thats worth playing. However, despite its cost, the game is able to deliver an incredible experience relying on exhilarating fast paced combat and is just generally a blast to play. Although it is a multiplayer game, and some of the people that you will encounter arent exactly of the best mental state, servers are plentiful to find and I highly suggest that you do yourself a favour and download the game.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/sad_me_im_sad"> /u/sad_me_im_sad </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1hjhczh/hyperdash_is_underrated/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1hjhczh/hyperdash_is_underrated/">[comments]</a></span>

It&#39;s not a huge difference but it&#39;s like the little details make it so real.</p> <p>Like the people on the side of the track. Not just standing there but feel like they&#39;re actually involved and alive.</p> <p>I fell like acknowledging them every time I drive by.</p> <p>Then there&#39;s the detail in the cars. Which I don&#39;t like when stuff gets overhyped but this one is not.</p> <p>I swear I spent half my time looking in the back seat and out the rear window just to check out my car.</p> <p>The detail is ridiculous. I&#39;m looking on the floor and the fuzzy fabric texture looks just like a real car. The glass on the odometer reflect light perfectly. Actually everything reflects light perfectly.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I had the problem in Asgard&#39;s Wrath 2 that I could not win the final battle from the third hero Alvilda. This is the fight where you have to defeat a giant crab in the hall where Sutur resides. There are videos about the battle and I could just not do it. I wanted to give up.</p> <p>When I looked for infos on internet I found that you can let Ptah new improved weapons that have slots where you could put in some relics. There are also arenas, where you can fight waves of enemies and level up your hero.</p> <p>I leveled my hero up to 30, improved mine and bow of Alvilda and then went back to Sutur. I kicked ass, the giant crab went down in less than one minute. :-)</p> <p>Finally it is still a role playing game, I feel a bit stupid not to manage that. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Philemon61"> /u/Philemon61 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1hj0kud/as

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Previously I was struggling HARD to record gameplay on my Quest 3 streaming from my PC from a dedicated router. Games had to be on med to low settings and would still have horrible stuttering and lag when I hit record on OBS.</p> <p>Just installed my 4070TS and loaded up the most graphically intensive games I could and this thing runs them like they&#39;re fucking NOTHING. 90fps constantly with maxed out graphics WHILE RECORDING with another spectator stream which almost doubles the performance hit and I have yet to see a single drop below 90fps.</p> <p>Dual encoding is incredible. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Give-Yer-Balls-A-Tug"> /u/Give-Yer-Balls-A-Tug </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1hiza2u/just_upgrading_from_a_3070_8gb_vram_to_a_4070_ti/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1hiza2u/just_upgra

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi. So i have been playing beat saber for around 2 or something years now and i recently bought q3 which i have been loving. I play beat saber through meta using a link cable that then goes through steamvr (I need to use a cable as i get too much delay otherwise) but i have been experiencing stuttering ever since i got it (120Hz 1X res in the meta app). Before i got it my setup was a HTC Vive and i never got any sort of stuttering on that headset and i have 2 questions for this:</p> <ol> <li>First of all, Is it expected that a <strong>Gainward GeForce RTX 3060 Ghost</strong>, <strong>AMD Ryzen 7 7700</strong> And 4 <strong>Kingston FURY Beast RGB DDR5 4800MHz</strong> 8GB sticks (running at 3600mhz as my cpu doesnt support running it at 4800mhz) will be able to run a simple game like beat saber at 120hz 1x res?</li> </ol> <p>I have ofc modded my beat saber game as i need to do so to get leaderboard mods.
