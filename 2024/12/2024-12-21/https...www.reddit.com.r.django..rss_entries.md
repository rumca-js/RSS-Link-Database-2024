<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone,</p> <p>I have a fully synchronous Django app running on Gunicorn with Uvicorn workers. However, I’ve run into a problem: I want to use Gunicorn’s instrumentation features and server hooks (pre_request, and post_request), but these aren’t supported with Uvicorn workers.</p> <p>I’m debating whether to switch from Uvicorn workers to Gunicorn’s default synchronous workers. I’ve read that Uvicorn workers can still offer better performance, even for synchronous apps, so I’m not sure if I should switch or not.</p> <p>Should I consider alternatives for instrumentation and server hooks, or would it be better to migrate to normal Gunicorn workers? I’d appreciate any advice or recommendations.</p> <p>Thanks in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Hewett555"> /u/Hewett555 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/1hj9seo/gunicorn_vs_gunicorn_with_uvicorn_workers/">[l

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I need to accomplish three real-time tasks using Django Channels. I need to track the status of my users (if they are online or offline), I need to send them notifications while they&#39;re on the site and I need to manage a live chat. I could maintain three separate WebSocket connections to three different consumers but that would be a pretty inefficient use of ressources.</p> <p>I would prefer to have one <em>main</em> WebSocket connection with a single consumer that dispatches the requests made to it to three <em>sub-consumers</em> to make it nice, clean and efficient while maintaining a clear separation between the three tasks.</p> <p><strong>How do I do this?</strong></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Affectionate-Ad-7865"> /u/Affectionate-Ad-7865 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/1hj0yq1/how_to_make_a_main_consumer_that_dispatches/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <sp
