Henderson was the biggest and brightest star of his\ngeneration. There may not have been any player in history who was\nbetter at more things than Rickey Henderson was.</p>\n\n<p>Henderson was, without question, the greatest leadoff hitter of\nall time and the greatest base-stealer of all time. He, arguably,\npossessed the greatest combination of power and speed of any\nplayer in the history of the game as well. Perhaps the best\ncharacterization of Henderson\u2019s career came from Bill James who\nonce wrote that, \u201cif you could split Rickey Henderson in two,\nyou\u2019d have two Hall of Famers.\u201d [...]</p>\n\n<p>In 1980, his first full major league season, Henderson broke Ty\nCobb\u2019s 65-year-old American League record for stolen bases by\nswiping 100 bags to Cobb\u2019s 96. In 1982 he stole 130 bases,\nbreaking Hall of Famer Lou Brock\u2019s all-time single-season record\n",
