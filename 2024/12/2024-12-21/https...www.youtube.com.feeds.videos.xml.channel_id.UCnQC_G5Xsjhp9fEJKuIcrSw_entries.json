Christmas has become a secularized and commercialized holiday as well as a cultural phenomenon instead of a religious one. There\u2019s been a loss of the importance of Christmas day, and Bishop Barron wants to recover the real religious heart of Christmas. This year, Hanukkah and Christmas fall at the same time. Ben and Bishop Barron talk about the ties that Hanukkah has to Christmas in biblical terms. Lastly, Bishop Barron leaves us with the big message of Christmas this year: The light conquers the darkness. \n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Click here to join the member-exclusive portion of my show: https://bit.ly/3WDjgHE\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 It\u2019s your LAST CHANCE to take advantage of our best sale of the year!
