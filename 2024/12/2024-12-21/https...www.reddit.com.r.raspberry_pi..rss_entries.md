<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi, I&#39;m looking for some help with my 3.5 inch screen and RPi 3b+. I&#39;ve tried installing LCD-show drivers, changing dtoverlay=piscreen,drm in /boot/firmware/config.txt and switching between X11 and Wayland and nothing works. The screen shows the booting screen and after that it&#39;s just blank.</p> <p>I&#39;ve read that there are some problems with Bookworm and that it works better with Bullseye but is there a way to make it work without installing older OS?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/mort_mortowski"> /u/mort_mortowski </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1hj7m23/35_inch_lcd_screen_not_working/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1hj7m23/35_inch_lcd_screen_not_working/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi I am new to raspberry pi and linux. Have played around a bit with arduino. Essentially all im trying to do is set up a door sensor with an alarm via bluetooth speaker. None of the code i try and enter works. I have followed tutorials for set up and semm to hit a wall with the gpio set up. When i try to install the python-rpi.gpio it says its not available and has no installation candidate. Have tried looking for answers but is kinda all gibberish to me. Can anyone help?
