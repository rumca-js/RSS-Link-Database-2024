My grandfather&#39;s Galaxy S20 keeps making &#39;snap&#39; sounds that sound like screenshots (but are not quite). It&#39;s also not any notification, there are none when it happens. I can&#39;t figure out a pattern or a way to reproduce it, seems to be random, every 5 minutes or so, sometimes one after another.</p> <p>ChatGPT said to check camera permissions for anything suspicious but nothing came up. Neither in Accessiblity permissions. He&#39;s a very careful and naturally suspicious person, he rarely downloads weird things and always wants me to delete as many unnecessary Apps as possible.</p> <p>I&#39;m a developer, so i can get a bit technical if you suggest some things to check out.
