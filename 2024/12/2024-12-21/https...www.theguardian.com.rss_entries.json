        "description": "<p>For the past decade, the Barcelona-based visual artist <a href=\"https://xavibou.com/\">Xavi Bou</a> has devoted his work to revealing \u201cthe hidden beauty of natural movement\u201d. His initial focus was birds; now he\u2019s moved on to insects. In collaboration with US entomologist Adrian Smith he\u2019s created an eye-popping series that captures \u2013 by merging multiple frames into a single image \u2013 the rhythmic flutterings of butterflies and chaotic leaps of spittlebugs and treehoppers. As well as their beauty, Bou was struck by the crucial role that insects play in ecosystems, even as their numbers plummet \u2013 it\u2019s estimated that the biomass of flying insect species has decreased by 75% over the past 27 years. \u201cWe need to move beyond seeing insects as mere nuisances,\u201d says Bou. \u201cThey are fascinating, essential creatures, and we owe them a great deal.\u201d </p><ul><li><a href=\"https://xavibou.com/\">See more of Xavi Bou\u2019s images here</a></li></ul> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/",

Leading experts from York University have traced the archaeological footprint of the Scandinavian invaders, identifying previously unknown sites and routes.</p><p>The study, conducted by Dawn M Hadley, professor of medieval archaeology, and fellow archaeology professor Julian D Richards, found that the significance of many of the ingots, gaming pieces and other artefacts unearthed by metal detectorists over the years had been overlooked until now.
