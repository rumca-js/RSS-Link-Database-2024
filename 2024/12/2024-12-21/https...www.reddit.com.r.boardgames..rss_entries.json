Now I decided to buy a game randomly (if I don&#39;t have it already of course) without checking the reviews or reading a lot of stuff in advance. Just using random advise from this great community and some intuition (may be I will just check the visuals, like box, art, theme maybe, but no more). So... if you would help me with this &quot;roulette&quot; it&#39;d be appreciated. My budget is 50 Euro (but feel free to go wild if you really think I need this :)). I&#39;m in EU (my group is usually 3 players) and I&#39;m ready to read comments and suggestions. Just drop something that you liked / loved in 2024 or earlier (and consider your top for a long / not so long time). Thank you all in advance for your comment. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submit",

But I have NEVER played a game this complicated, and I&#39;ve not played the original Nemesis either. There is just so much to learn at once, its too much! I&#39;ve looked on Google for a rule set that simplifies the game, couldn&#39;t find one though. Any of yall played this game before? How would you dumb it down in a way that my family could play, but not so much that it ruins it? Or would simplifying the game ruin the experience?
