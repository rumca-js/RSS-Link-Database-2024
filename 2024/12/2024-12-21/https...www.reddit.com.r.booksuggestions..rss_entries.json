All of my friends have specific tastes that I think I&#39;ve pretty much nailed except one...</p> <p>She&#39;s mid-late 20s and works at a greenhouse/farmer&#39;s market type store and she&#39;ll have about 2-3 months off of work since they close in the winter. One of my ideas is to get her a romance with a main character like her or a story set during a snowy winter to capture the mood, but I don&#39;t really read romance and am worried of picking out something too cheesy. (She also has a boyfriend who none of the rest of us really like because he&#39;s kind of a deadbeat\ud83d\ude2d so bonus points if the MC has an ex like that or falls for a really good guy lol)</p> <p>She also likes true crime, so I&#39;m maybe thinking thrillers but she HATES plot holes in movies so I don&#39;t want to get her something she&#39;ll end ",

Really loved books like Snow Crash, Neuromancer, almost anything written by cory Doctorow, Robot City, The Deamon trilogy by Daniel Suarez etc. </p> <p>So, a technical angle would be nice but I&#39;m not sure if that even exists. I also like medieval books with the church and witch angle. </p> <p>I&#39;m not that much into elves, unicorns, supernatural stuff but more into paranormal, dark mythology stuff. </p> <p>Not sure if that helps. </p> <p>Well just fire away and let&#39;s see if something I like finds me. </p> <p>Thanks for all your suggestions. </p> <p>P.S.

I loved Harry Potter, Jacqueline Wilson, Percy Jackson, Hunger Games and when I was a bit younger Enid Blyton. But I feel like lately, especially over the past couple of years, I&#39;ve kind of lost my ability to read books. I just feel like now instead of picking up a book I would much rather go on my phone or scroll on Tiktok, not to mention the fact that I dont have as much spare time on my hands anymore. It&#39;s not like I never read: I do. But I just feel like its not the same as how it was before. Recently, I have been trying to read more though, especially over the autumn break, so that&#39;s why I&#39;m asking for some book reccomendations! Any advice is also greatly appreciated! I&#39;m not really into non fiction book, but I do enjoy fiction crime/msytery, thriller, feminist literature, YA, anything like that, though I dont really have preferences.</p> <p>Some books that I&#39",

As the year comes to an end, I was reflecting on my reading journey this year and realised that I mostly read Sci-Fi. For me the best book for this year would be Project Hail Mary which I read in March. But essentially, what I&#39;m looking for: pick your favourite genre and pick your favourite book from it. I want to diversify my reading in the next year so your suggestions would be of great help. With that said, I&#39;m not really into Non-fiction and Romance but you are welcome to share your suggestion nonetheless. </p> <p>Thanks in advance.

Not much later I read &quot;Spear&quot; by Nicola Griffith and loved that one too. Both novels have some sort of twist or something innovative to them (female Percival in Spear; trans male Jesus in Him and combining very classical subject matter with a fresh, sci-fi- or fantasy-ispired approach to explain events). I like that it&#39;s not a completely new fantasy world but grounded in something familiar to me - myths, legends, religious lore. Ideally the novel would somehow be related to this time of year / any sort of myths related to it. I also loved how the exploration of the intrinsic emotional or psychological struggles of the characters is packaged in such beautiful and expressive prose.</p> <p>Can anyon",

I never really read much for fun growing up \u2013 I have ADD, so sticking with a book was always tough when there were other distractions around. But about five years ago, a friend sent me Harry Potter and the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone for free on Audible. I got hooked and ended up going through the whole series. </p> <p>Since then, I\u2019ve read the Stoneheart trilogy, the Mistborn trilogy, and I just finished Ready Player One. Now I\u2019m looking for my next read and I\u2019m a little stuck. I\u2019m not sure if I should keep going with more in the Cosmere, jump into Ready Player Two, or try something completely different. </p> <p>I seem to gravitate toward stories with adventurous worlds and character growth \u2013 I love seeing someone evolve into a badass, especially in new, futuristic, or dystopian settings. </p> <p>Would love to hear any recommendations you all might have!

I do really want to read a fantasy book, but I\u2019m so mentally tired from school that I\u2019d like something fun but not too intense. I really like \u201cHouse in the Cerulean Sea\u201d by TJ Klune, \u201cThe Road of Bones\u201d by Demi Winters, and \u201cThe Wolf and the Woodsman\u201d by Ava Reid.

I know in the past she loved the twilight series when they first came out. </p> <p>She&#39;s bought a couple of other books but never finished them. She likes true crime, romance, mystery and all things cats and dogs. I think she&#39;d love a book with a gripping story she couldn&#39;t put down. Sorry if it&#39;s too broad of a suggestion :(</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Abovemeis\"> /u/Abovemeis </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1hixn00/suggestion_for_36_year_old_female_who_likes_to/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1hixn00/suggestion_for_36_year_old_female_who_likes_to/\">[comments]</a></span>",

During Dec I try and read Christmas themed books and I&#39;ve read plenty of the more light hearted ones or rom coms and I&#39;ve been craving something a bit darker. I usually read anything as long as there&#39;s romance in there and have no preference as far as what kind of triggers are in a book. </p> <p>I recently read <strong>hunted in holly</strong> by LeAnn Belle and <em>Silent Night</em>* by ML Philpitt and really enjoyed those two and wouldn&#39;t mind reading others like them. The Christmas theme doesn&#39;t have to be overly strong, but I would like the books to have something christmassy or Christmas releated about them. </p> <p>Thanks in advance for any help!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Practical-Reader\"> /u/Practical-Reader </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksugges",
