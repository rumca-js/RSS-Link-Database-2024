AGI is general intelligence, meaning an AGI system should be able to <strong>play chess</strong> at a human level, <strong>communicate</strong> at a human level, and, when given a video feed of a car driving, provide control inputs to <strong>drive a car.</strong> It should also be able to do new things <strong>without explicit pre-training</strong>. Just as a human can be taught to do a new task they have never seen before, an AGI system needs to be able to do the same.</p> <h1>Current Systems</h1> <p>This may seem obvious to many, but it\u2019s worth stating given some posts here.
