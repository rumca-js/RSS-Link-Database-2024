<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi i just finished reading this book, absolutely heartbreaking. One question plagued my mind and that&#39;s why Lydia didn&#39;t ever write in her diary? I would think diary a safe place to put her inner plaguing thoughts. The only thoughts I could think was that she didn&#39;t want to acknowledge her feelings or she didn&#39;t want her mom to see it and make her feel disappointed (just like she hid her cookbook). Any thoughts about why? Am i missing something</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Piggysnorts"> /u/Piggysnorts </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hjjm9h/everything_i_never_told_you_by_celeste_ng/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hjjm9h/everything_i_never_told_you_by_celeste_ng/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Erich Fromm I looooove this man. I remember reading To Have or To Be and really enjoying it, though for some reason, I never finished it. Last Thursday I was at the bookstore, I stumbled across The Art of Loving and couldn‚Äôt resist. It only took me a day to finish, and what can I say? As always, Fromm has this incredible ability to explain life‚Äôs most complex truths with the clarity and simplicity of someone speaking to a five year-old. Yet, he leaves breadcrumbs of sources and ideas if you want to go deeper.</p> <p>I‚Äôm translating the excerpts from French to English, so bear with me.</p> <p>The book begins with a sharp observation: ‚ÄúFor most people, the essential problem of love is to be loved, rather than to love.‚Äù He goes on to say, ‚ÄúPeople think that loving is easy, and that what‚Äôs difficult is finding the right object to love.‚Äù These lines struck a chord with me because so much of what Fromm wrote aligned perfectly with beliefs I already held ab

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m reading James by Percival Everett. It&#39;s The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn told through Jim&#39;s eyes. I&#39;m about 30% in, and I&#39;m enjoying it.</p> <p>Twain characterized Jim as a caricature, a superstitious fool. He&#39;s the butt of many jokes in the original story. This book posits Jim as highly intelligent and well-spoken. He uses slave speak in front of white people because he knows it&#39;s safer if they think he&#39;s an idiot. Awesome premise!</p> <p>What confuses me is how well educated Jim is. He&#39;s not just smart; he&#39;s knowledgeable. He knows about Voltaire and Rousseau. He&#39;s incredibly eloquent with an amazing vocabulary, and no explanation has been provided thus far about how he gained all this knowledge.</p> <p>It isn&#39;t realistic that he would be so well educated. My thinking is that Everett isn&#39;t trying to be realistic. He&#39;s putting Jim on the other extreme of complete idiocy as a fuck you to M

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I just finished yellowface (and absolutely loved it by the way!)</p> <p>But has anybody noticed with the cover, when you have the book open and are holding up to your own face reading it, it makes you as the reader look like you are wearing it as a mask?</p> <p>It almost feels like it could be a commentary on the insidious nature of what happens in the book (I don&#39;t want to post any spoilers) and how many of us may be complicit in this type of thing, without even realising. </p> <p>I have no idea if this is intentional, but if so...

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>For reasons I won&#39;t get into, I once spent Christmas Eve with a friend&#39;s family. I was quite young but can&#39;t recall how old. I felt super uncomfortable there not just because it was my first time at their home but because they seemed very proper and I kept thinking I was making a mistake the way I was eating food or the way I was answering a question or whatever.</p> <p>Later that evening, my friend said we should be quiet now because her dad was gonna read from a book, which was one of their traditions. I thought this can&#39;t be good, expecting a slow reading of a boring poem I would not understand or perhaps a religious prayer that would go on for a long long time.</p> <p>But instead he read sections from A Christmas Carol. What was most surprising to me though was how the father changed as soon as he started reading the book. He became so passionate, so animated, started doing voices, making faces, and this was totally captivating an
