<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I always seem to fall into a reading slump this time of year. Some years, I manage to read a few books before I just can’t stand reading anymore. Other years, I did not read a single book in the month of December. </p> <p>My guess is that it’s the end of the year and I’m burnt out from all the reading I’ve done. I also tend to fall into a big reading slump in either June or July, the halfway point of the year where I’m overwhelmed with all the books I still “need” to read. </p> <p>Does this happen to anyone else?

## Reading On the Road by Jack Kerouac made very nostalgic for a time I never lived in

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Disclaimer: I know, like most books in its vein, On the Road was sensationalized to a degree. I also understand that the Beat Generation was countercultural and Kerouac’s writings do not represent the general views of people of the 1950s. </p> <p>That being said, as a Gen-Z guy who recently finished this book, I was really struck by how unusual so many of the formative, chaotic experiences portrayed in this story would be in the America of today. On an obvious level, hitchhiking and carpooling with random people cross country are largely a thing of the past. I also found the characters rolling into random towns and instantly getting informal work as unrealistic. I mean, these days you have to submit an online resume for Walmart, and they’re also gonna run a background check, which would have severely hampered Dean’s employment opportunities. People also just take fewer chances now. Statistically, our generation uses way less drugs, has way less sex,

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Just finished the novel yesterday. First of all, even though I say that every single I finish a long novel by Murakami, no matter how much doubt or hate he may be receiving as of late, it&#39;s an objectively challenging task to write a novel 1318 pages long and have the reader&#39;s boredom or weariness be minimal (or to be honest close to nonexistent) and he absolutely achieved that, so I take my hat off to him. Having said that, I found 1Q84 to be a particularly enjoyable and gripping page turner. This is not always necessary to make for an amazing read, and every novel that is enjoyable to read is not necessarily amazing, but if I&#39;m being honest, the best reads are those in which those two qualities come together. That in my humble opinion of course. And 1Q84 certainly was one of those for me. As a reader I generally tend to believe that the journey is more importnant than the destination, but it would be a blatant lie to not admit that 1Q84

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>What is your favourite, or some of your favourite book titles, and what is its significance or insignificance? Is the title directly quoted, or does the title not get quoted directly and is more thematic?</p> <p>For me, it&#39;s <em>The Left Hand of Darkness</em> by Ursula K. Le Guin. The title of the book is what pulled me in. It&#39;s directly quoted in the book as &quot;Light is the left hand of darkness, and darkness the right hand of light&quot;. Its referring to the age old thought that light and dark need to exist together and you can&#39;t have one without the other. Its not just a reference to the duality of light and dark, but to others as well such as gender and class structure, and how these things are not so black and white.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Jeranda"> /u/Jeranda </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hadvd9/your_favourite_book_titles_its_sig

The Guardian&#39;s review was apt, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/17/books/review/entitlement-rumaan-alam.html">NY Times review</a> feels like it&#39;s full of lies and exagerrations. The reviewer couldn&#39;t possibly have thought this was a good book.</p> <p>I enjoyed Leave the World Behind, I didn&#39;t love it, but it was an easy read and I found it thought-provoking. Entitlement feels like he was in a rush and didn&#39;t want to lose the book advance. It feels like it&#39;s all telling and not showing. The main character feels 2-dimensional and has only 5 people in her life-- she&#39;s not fleshed out at all. The elderly billionaire has a similarly narrow characterization-- nothing going on with him besides his wife and his new charity foundation.

But what if actually society is shaping us?&#39;&#39;</strong></p> <p>Yanagihara&#39;s perception of history in this novel is totally decentered from individuality, an almost living, breathing entity, with her characters (of limited agency) being merely varied along in its wake. After all, To Paradise is a novel about all that history can take away from us: Our freedom, our dignity, our safety, our families, our loved ones (in Charlie&#39;s case in the third section of the novel even her literal emotional intelligence and critical thinking ability). But one thing it can not, argues Yanagihara: A series of certain fundemental desires too elemental to what humans are to simply be stamped out of humanity, no matter the society one may live in or how totalitarian a state may be: The desire to love, to be loved, to find affection, beauty and many more.
