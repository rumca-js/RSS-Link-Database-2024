Drafty basement tips…most basements get air leaks at the rim joists. I use Great Stuff Wide Spray with the cone nozzle to fill gaps between the rim joist and wall openings. I also lightly spray the foam to speed up the cure time. This speeds up the project and makes it a fast installation. Many thanks to Great Stuff for sponsoring this video, visit greatstuff.dupont.com to find the best spray foam for your project 👍🏽🔥#greatstuff #greatstuffsprayfoam #basementremodel #sponsored
