        "description": "Drafty basement tips\u2026most basements get air leaks at the rim joists. I use Great Stuff Wide Spray with the cone nozzle to fill gaps between the rim joist and wall openings. I also lightly spray the foam to speed up the cure time. This speeds up the project and makes it a fast installation. Many thanks to Great Stuff for sponsoring this video, visit greatstuff.dupont.com to find the best spray foam for your project \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\udd25#greatstuff #greatstuffsprayfoam #basementremodel #sponsored",
