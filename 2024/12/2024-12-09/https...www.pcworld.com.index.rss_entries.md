<p>Being able to expand storage capacity is always great, especially when it lets you save money on, say, a phone with less storage out of the box. Right now, you can expand your storage with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lexar-Compatible-Nintendo-Switch-Smartphones-LMSPLAY001T-BNNNU/dp/B08T8LL7G8/">Lexar’s 1TB microSD that’s down to $75 on Amazon</a>, a solid 44 percent off its $130 MSRP.</p>



<p>Whether you want to use this with your phone, tablet, security camera, action camera, Nintendo Switch, or another gaming device, this microSD card will be ready for anything.</p>



<p>The 1TB storage space is massive, especially at this price. That’s dozens of games for your console, tons of apps and photos for your phone, and lots of hours of video for your camera.</p>



<p>Speaking of video, this card supports up to 160MB/s read speeds and 100MB/s write spe

## Microsoft Recall, tested: I like the AI, but I just can’t trust it

<p>Set aside all of the privacy concerns concerning Recall, Microsoft’s AI-powered memory tool within Windows. Even if I want to like it — and I do want to — I don’t think it’s quite dependable yet to solve all of my problems.</p>



<p>Privacy advocates don’t want anything spying on them as they browse the Web, check email, post on social media, and so on. People who chase scattered details across the Web for publication, like me, are much more welcoming. Where Recall falls short right now is that is sort of fails on both: it’s there, always watching, but not closely enough that you can depend upon it to find the critical detail that you missed.</p>



<p>I spent the better part of a week with Recall running in the background, trying to see a.) whether it would actually prove to be useful enough to keep and b.) whether I could either break it or it would fr

<p>Logitech’s MX series of mice and keyboards is generally considered the cream of the crop if you aren’t specifically looking for something mechanical or gaming-focused. But they’re also pretty darn pricey.</p>



<p>Today, you can get a bundle that includes the Logitech MX Keys S keyboard and the newest Logitech MX Master 3S mouse, plus some other goodies, <strong>for just $144.99</strong>. That’s $65 off the retail price. You’ll need to take a few steps to unlock this bundled price, though.</p>



<p>First, add to cart the <a href="https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/combos/mx-keys-s-combo.920-011889.html">MX Keys S combo on Logitech’s store</a>. That’s listed for $199.99 price, which is already $10 less versus the MX Keys S and MX Master 3S mouse separately, plus a sweet wrist rest included. Once added to your cart, you’ll notice that you also get a

<p>When I’m leaving my house for extended periods of time, I always take a power bank with me because I never know when I’m going to need it. If you want to do the same, this <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Portable-Charger-Baseus-20000mAh-Charging/dp/B08THCNNCS/">high-capacity Baseus power bank is only $25 on Amazon</a> right now — a whopping 69 percent off.</p>



<p>This Baseus power bank isn’t just for phones. It’s powerful enough to recharge your laptop, too, with its 65 watts of max output. Even if your specific laptop usually requires more power, it’ll still work (albeit slightly slower). And with 20,000mAh of capacity, it can recharge a MacBook Pro almost fully from zero. (Or an iPhone 15 Pro over three times.)</p>



<p>It features three charging ports you can use: one USB-C port and two USB-A ports. That USB-C port is the only one that goes up to 6

<p>The Raspberry Pi 400 was a hit when it came out in 2020, harkening back to the days when people would stuff a whole computer under the gigantic keys of an old-fashioned keyboard. If you love that form factor but need something a little more beefy, the new Raspberry Pi 500 is here with the same design but upgraded Pi 5 guts.</p>



<p>The Pi 500 is a standalone computer with all the connections you need along its top edge. But if you’re also looking for a matching monitor, you’re in luck because the company just released <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/raspberry-pi-500-and-raspberry-pi-monitor-on-sale-now/">its first home-grown monitor</a>, a spiffy-looking 15.6-inch model. It can work as a travel display or a small conventional desktop monitor thanks to its VESA mount, and it’s <a href="https://www.pishop.us/product/raspberry-pi-monitor-red-whit

<p>Microsoft has finally incorporated the updated WebUI 2.0 framework in the latest versions of Edge for Windows 11, which significantly improves the company’s browser performance, reports <a href="https://www.windowslatest.com/2024/12/07/microsoft-edge-is-getting-really-faster-on-windows-11-menus-elements-load-instantly/">Windows Latest</a>.</p>



<p>The updated framework reduces loading times for elements of the user interface, resulting in a faster and more responsive experience. For example, “Browser Essentials” should now load 42 percent faster while the “Favorites” bar opens 40 percent faster than before.</p>



<p>These improvements should be particularly noticeable on lower-performance computers, such as those with less RAM and without SSD storage. For budget laptops, this adds one more reason to <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394959/why-s
