<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I want to dual boot my laptop with Ubuntu or derivative (UbuntuStudio, probably) and Windows 11, but from two different installed SSDs. I have a NVMe SSD that I want to boot Ubuntu from (because, obviously) and then have Windows boot from the NAND SATA SSD.</p> <p>I have this (more or less) right now, but whenever I want to switch I have to go into the BIOS and do different options, and that&#39;s inconvenient.</p> <p>Preferably, I want to use GRUB, since I have a habit of keeping a few stable kernels around as fallback options in case and update goes sideways, and that&#39;s easy to manage with GRUB.</p> <p>Specs:</p> <p>Dell Inspiron 5570<br/> 1TB NVMe SSD<br/> 1TB NAND SATA SSD<br/> BIOS can do secureboot (or not), AHCI or RAID, UEFI or Legacy</p> <p>Here are my hopes and dreams:</p> <ol> <li>No booting to BIOS to switch between Ubuntu and Windows</li> <li>GRUB for choosing OS / Kernel at startup <ol> <li>Would rather not have to boot Windows with

## Slimbook Excalibur - a few thoughts

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’ve been using the Slimbook Excalibur for six months now, and overall, it has proven to be a solid choice for the price. At €980 + VAT, getting a notebook with 32 GB of RAM and a 1 TB drive is excellent value, especially compared to alternatives like Lenovo with soldered RAM or Dell laptops with Intel CPUs.</p> <p><strong>Pros:</strong></p> <ul> <li>The aluminium case feels sturdy and premium, giving the laptop a robust build.</li> <li>Its slim and lightweight design is impressive for a 15.6-inch notebook</li> <li>It runs cool even during extended use, though I haven’t tested it under heavy loads. It&#39;s quite enough while not on load. Could be a bit better while on load, but is not terribly bad (I am demanding in this area).</li> <li>The screen quality is very good, which suffices for casual use. I mostly use a 4K monitor, so I’m not overly demanding in this area.</li> <li>Practical features like enough ports and USB-C charging are welcome, thoug

## What do we all think about flatpaks?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I think Flatpaks are awesome and are essential for Linux to gain more marketshare without developers having to test several different distributions. The ability to install any app and expect it to work and it doing so because the correct dependencies are already there is great.</p> <p>However I see a pretty decent amount of people talking about how they&#39;re bloated or slower performance wise or are no better than snaps and there is also the fact that some developers just don&#39;t like making flatpaks and would rather only ship/test for debian based distros only as that&#39;s where most Linux users are.</p> <p>I&#39;d assume that the general consensus is that flatpaks are good, but I&#39;d love to hear some more in depth takes about them or alternative takes/criticism because I have a basic idea of reasons as to why they can be frustrating.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/S1rTerra"> /u/S1rTerr

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>After trying to explain Linux as an alternative to my wife, I began recalling how I regularly compiled my own kernels. Of course this was decades ago, but at the time building a kernel made sense. Computers had limited resources (or at least my cheap rigs did), and compiling made a system lean. I am referring to years back, before modules, if memory serves me right.</p> <p>I recall removing the bloat of every driver needed for every video system and including only the one I required, as well as dumping useless stuff, such as HAM stuff, and a lot of network stuff I did not require. </p> <p>I could really shrink a kernel. There has to be some older folks around that did this too, right.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/GreatBigPig"> /u/GreatBigPig </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1ha2bhc/do_you_remember_compiling_your_own_kernels/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a hr
