Today&#39;s paper is titled &quot;SelfPrompt: Autonomously Evaluating LLM Robustness via Domain-Constrained Knowledge Guidelines and Refined Adversarial Prompts&quot; by Aihua Pei, Zehua Yang, Shunan Zhu, Ruoxi Cheng, and Ju Jia.</p> <p>This paper introduces SelfPrompt, a novel framework aiming to evaluate the robustness of large language models (LLMs) in a more autonomous and cost-effective manner. Traditional robustness evaluations often rely heavily on standardized benchmarks, which are both expensive and limited in scope. The proposed method uses domain-constrained knowledge guidelines in the forms of knowledge graphs and refined adversarial prompts to conduct internal evaluations without relying on ex

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everybody! I spent the weekend doing a quick personal project experimenting with scraping AI subreddits and using LLMs / natural language processing to generate an opinion piece on a hot AI topic. My process looked like this:</p> <p>* Scrape the top 100 posts in the last month for <a href="/r/ArtificialInteligence">r/ArtificialInteligence</a>, <a href="/r/artificial">r/artificial</a>, and <a href="/r/OpenAI">r/OpenAI</a><br/> * Use NLP techniques to find frequently discussed topics across the posts and comments<br/> * Identify one of the most frequently discussed topics by visualizing the NLP model<br/> * Have an LLM summarize that topic by analyzing the most correlated comments and posts<br/> * Feed that that summarization and the list of comments/posts into another LLM to generate something like an opinion piece backed by Reddit</p> <p>I can imagine a system that uses this topic finding tech to autonomously find hot themes across multiple subre

## The real definition of AGI.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>A true AGI system should be capable of being applied to any task, known or unknown, learning how to solve it, and working through it to at least the level of an average human who has experience in that domain. It should then distribute that solution across its neural network, enabling the system to perpetuate innovation and grow its intelligence collectively. </p> <p>Simply mimicking human knowledge isn’t enough to qualify as AGI. While agents and reasoning can contribute to that goal, they aren’t the solution. For instance, an AI might figure out how to make spaghetti by searching Google and filtering and “reasoning” through its mistakes. However, this doesn’t mean it can handle unfamiliar scenarios, and starts experimenting with the prompt within limits given—and that adaptability is precisely what we need from AGI to truly shine. It is a totally different ballpark and we are nowhere close. Not enough compute, infrastructure and changability for th

It&#39;s very difficult to find data that really shows the problem solving process e.g hypothesis testing, backtracking etc</li> <li>RL although important is overrated by the general community.
