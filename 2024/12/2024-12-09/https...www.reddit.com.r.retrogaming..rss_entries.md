## ZYCLUNT also knows as BLADE WARRIOR (for obvious reasons) in the west, is the reason why i adored South korean games. This was a DOS/win game back in a time when such games were mainly for consoles only. It was fast, smooth, pretty and most of all, fun. Still worth playing today and i still do.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I hope I can find some help here. I&#39;ve recently introduced my 9yr old son to old school arcade games and he loves them. We&#39;ve played Sunset riders, Captain commando, vendetta and similar games. That&#39;s pretty much where my knowledge ends. We have been to a few arcades around where we live and we both really like shooters like jurassic park, star wars and the house of the dead games. Is there a way to emulate those at home? Are there gun kits that you can buy for home use that would work with those type of games? Are the emulators specifically for arcade shooters? Any and all help, information and direction greatly appreciated.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SolarHerc"> /u/SolarHerc </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1hael63/home_arcade_shooter/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1hael63/home_arcade
