<p>If you feel like you don’t have enough outlets at home, here’s something really cool that’s on sale: an outlet extender with built-in surge protection, which turns one outlet into nine ports. And it’s seriously <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Charger-Protector-QINLIANF-Extender-Charging/dp/B08R6S1M1K/">just $10 on Amazon right now</a>, a cool 23 percent off its usual price.</p>



<p>This thing plugs right into any wall outlet, covers the entire plate, fastens with a single screw, and sits flush against your wall. Then, instead of your normal two-outlet receptable, you now have a total of five three-pronged AC outlets, three USB-A ports, and a USB-C port. (That screw is important as it prevents the whole thing from accidentally being pulled out.)</p>



<p>Of course, when plugging this many devices into a single receptable, you’re bound to increase your r

<p>Now that wireless gaming mice are just as fast and feature packed as their wired counterparts, going wireless can be a smart move, giving you greater flexibility as a gamer. But before you cut loose and buy one, it’s worth noting they’re not all alike. You’ll still need to consider factors like weight, dots per inch (DPI), and battery life which can be telling factors in how your gaming mouse performs and ultimately how you will perform in games. </p>



<p>Our expert reviewers have put these mice through their paces, testing them across a range of scenarios, and over extended periods of time — you can find out all about our extensive testing process in the article “<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2285871/how-we-test-gaming-mice-at-pcworld.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2285871/how-we-test-gaming-mice-at-pcworld.h

<p>AMD’s <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2511540/amd-ryzen-7-9800x3d-review.html">Ryzen 7 9800X3D is the new hotness</a> around the gaming PC picnic table.

<p>Not even a week ago, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2545157/microsoft-doubles-down-still-wont-let-older-pcs-run-windows-11.html">Microsoft doubled down</a> on its policy that requires PCs to have TPM 2.0-compatible hardware in order to install Windows 11. But now, in an unexpected and puzzling move, the company is issuing instructions for installing Windows 11 on incompatible PCs.</p>



<p>You can find those official instructions on <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/installing-windows-11-on-devices-that-don-t-meet-minimum-system-requirements-0b2dc4a2-5933-4ad4-9c09-ef0a331518f1#:~:text=Die%20Installation%20von%20Windows%2011,vertraut%20sein,%20dass%20Kompatibilit%C3%A4tsprobleme%20auftreten.">this support page</a>.

## ASRock’s new OLED monitors have built-in Wi-Fi antennas

<p>There are now so many OLED monitors on the market that new ones need to be notably cheap in order to attract attention. But ASRock is trying a different approach with its newest models: the ability to boost your PC motherboard’s Wi-Fi signal. Intriguing.</p>



<p>To be clear, these new ASRock monitors do not have <em>onboard</em> Wi-Fi, and they don’t have any smart TV features for standalone streaming apps. That was my first thought, but nope. Instead, the monitors function as a gigantic extension for the little barrel ports on the back of your Wi-Fi-equipped motherboard, the kind that usually lead to a cheap plastic antenna included in the box.</p>



<p>As a desktop guy who obsesses over cable management, I can see the appeal. According to the spec sheet, the antennas in the monitors are compatible with Wi-Fi versions 4 through 7.</p>

<p><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/status-windows-11-24h2#3456msgdesc">According to Microsoft</a>, users who have updated to Windows 11 24H2 may run into issues when opening Outlook if they have Google Workspace Sync installed on their system.</p>



<p>Google Workspace Sync for Microsoft Outlook makes it easier to manage and organize Google Workspace emails, calendar events, contacts, notes, and tasks from directly within Outlook, making it nearly essential for anyone who works with both Google Workspace and Outlook.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, after updating to Windows 11 24H2, you might observe that Microsoft Outlook fails to launch altogether — and because of this, you can’t uninstall Google Workspace Sync. The solution is to update Google Workspace Sync to version 4.3.68.0, which should get everything back in order again.<

<p>It looks like it’ll soon be easier to quickly see how much battery you have left on your Windows 11 laptop. <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/windows-11-is-finally-getting-a-redesigned-battery-indicator/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Neowin reports</a> that Microsoft has hidden a new battery indicator in Build 26120.2510 of Windows 11, currently only available to Insiders on the Dev Channel.</p>



<p>The new battery indicator will be larger than the current battery icon, and it will be a bit more colorful as well. Instead of the current black-and-white design with small symbols in the corners — a lightning bolt for charging and a heart for smart charging — the new design turns green when charging and yellow when Power Saving Mode is activated.</p>



<p>As of this writing, the new design is only seen in the taskbar whereas the old design

<p>Qualcomm’s 2024 debut of new Arm processors for Windows laptops was arguably the most important PC hardware announcement since the introduction of Intel’s 486 processors in 1989. Just as that CPU line heralded an age of Intel-driven x86 dominance, Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X Elite chips have now taken us into a new era of competition.</p>



<p>But 2024 was only the preview. Qualcomm’s Snapdragon debut was limited, targeting a specific subset of premium, thin-and-light Windows laptops that don’t require discrete graphics. 2025 will be the year that shows us the true extent of Arm innovation in PCs.</p>



<p>I spoke with two expert analysts in the hardware space for insights on how Arm PCs will continue to grow going forward.</p>
