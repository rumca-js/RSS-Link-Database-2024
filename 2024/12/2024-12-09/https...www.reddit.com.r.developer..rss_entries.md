<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Please forgive any arrogance as I know absolutely 0 about all of this stuff but really want to learn more. I am interested in building a workout tracking app where you build up your character based on tracked workouts and then you can battle friends. Like I said, I have no idea where to start. If I were to hire a developer, how much would it cost and how would I do that? If I had to learn code, how long before I could even build the Home Screen, 2 years? I would love to hear would you all would do if you were looking to get your first app made. Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Clear_Syllabub8648"> /u/Clear_Syllabub8648 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1haeacl/best_route_to_build_an_app/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1haeacl/best_route_to_build_an_app/">[comments]</a></span>
