I’m not someone who’s completely mastered coding yet, so I haven’t landed a job—I’m still learning the code and math behind it all. I also come from a non-tech background.</p> <p>With what I’ve learned so far, I want to expand my knowledge by implementing it in a website. However, I can’t afford to pay for hosting. I know some platforms, like AWS Free Tier, offer free services for 12 months, but what happens after that? From where would I pay? Also, I’m not expecting the website to become popular overnight—it might take more than a year to gain traction.</p> <p>Can anyone suggest completely free hosting solutions for projects like this?
