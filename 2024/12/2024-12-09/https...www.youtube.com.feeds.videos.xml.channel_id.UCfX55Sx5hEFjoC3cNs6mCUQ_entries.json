        "description": "At the recent Open Source Summit in Vienna, Austria, Mike Bursell, Executive Director of the Confidential Computing Consortium, discussed the importance of confidential computing, which uses hardware-based controls to isolate sensitive data and applications from untrusted infrastructure. \nBursell highlighted the consortium's role in promoting confidential computing through open-source projects, standardized frameworks, and educational outreach, emphasizing its relevance across various industries, including finance, healthcare, and AI. \nThe consortium, part of the Linux Foundation, includes major tech companies and startups, and focuses on attestation services, governance, and compliance to ensure secure data handling. Challenges like attestation business models and the need for continuous improvement in usability were also addressed.",
