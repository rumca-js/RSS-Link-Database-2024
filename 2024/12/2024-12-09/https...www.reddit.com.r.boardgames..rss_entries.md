I was winning every encounter now, until I had an encounter with the aforementioned friend. After I declared an upset and played another Negotiate card against his Attack, he added a reinforcement card to my side, bringing my total of ships and bonuses above his. </p> <p>Was he allowed to do this? We ruled that the Negotiate is an auto-win in an upset, meaning that he could not add reinforcements to it, and this led to my victory.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Reddit_gopher"> /u/Reddit_gopher </a> <br/> <span><a href="h

This is a beast of a game and difficult to learn. I did learn it and could run it smoothly after about seven plays. But some aspects are so tedious that I lost my will to continue. Chief among them is the high amount of tiles and having to go on a scavenger hunt to find the many required ones for each quest. Then there is a huge mess of tokens. I find it to be unnecessary and tiresome. Amazing game aside from that…</p> <p>I have noticed that these are common problems.

Then, we each drafted one power card starting with the player last in turn order and ending with the starting player. </p> <p>The goal was to try and give each player a little bit of extra direction at the beginning of the game, and as I said, ultimately just to make everyone feel a little more powerful and the game more exciting . </p> <p>What do y’all think?

She organizes her cards in ascending order regardless of suit (picture 1). The rest of us sort by suit and then ascending order within each suit (picture 2).</p> <p>She thinks we&#39;re the weird ones.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey, i am currently looking to expand my collection. So i started a list, that got out of control way to fast and now im just so unsure where to go next..</p> <p>So my friends and i love playing root and dune imperium a lot mainly. Games with different playable characters are just great :)</p> <p>We tried playing gloomhaven but they just arent made for such long campaign sessions unfortunately. I love such games and played gloomhaven online myself instead.. so i will probably get mage knight for myself. I think a game needs to have closed levels / rounds (less commitment) to work for them. Feel free to say if something would never work realistically :)</p> <p>We are 4 players.</p> <p>So ive written down everything i saw:</p> <p>Too many bones</p> <p>Mage knight (for myself singleplayer)</p> <p>Dwellings of Eldervale</p> <p>Spirit Island</p> <p>Clank!</p> <p>Zombicide</p> <p>Civolution</p> <p>Arcs</p> <p>Heat</p> <p>Scythe</p> <p>Ahoy</p> <p>Underwate

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Playing wonderful creatures for the first times. Two questions. If a player doesn’t have a possible action but hasnt deployed all workers can they recall. Like if a player has not deployed all three workers but can’t because the only tiles available are mountains and they have no resources, and can’t play a card or do an achievement are they allowed to recall? And lastly are the lily just dead spaces?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/omgplatypus"> /u/omgplatypus </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1h9wmm9/wondrous_creatures_rules_question/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1h9wmm9/wondrous_creatures_rules_question/">[comments]</a></span>
