<p>With the city’s international reputation on the line, a 100-day review period hopes to cut through the political posturing and land on a main venue befitting of the Games</p><p>The 2032 Olympics have for a long time felt far away, but it took Gout Gout to show they are just around the corner. The Brisbane teenager’s barely believable 200m national record on Saturday has upped the urgency on organisers to get Games planning right, as Queenslanders dream of an Olympic sprinting medal from a local product.</p><p>The venue options for athletics and the opening and closing ceremonies are well-known and the deadlines obvious. But more than three years after Brisbane won the right to host the 2032 Olympics, uneven ambition and political manoeuvring means organisers have not yet decided on the site.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/dec/10/brisbane-olympics-2032-stadium-options-gabba-suncorp-victoria-park">Continue reading...</a>

## Soucek and Bowen stave off Wolves on emotional night for West Ham

<p>Pitted against the incompetence of Wolves’ defending, the mediocrity of West Ham’s performance was not enough to bring about the end of Julen Lopetegui’s unhappy reign. Instead it is likely to be Gary O’Neil looking for a new job after his side were beaten <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2024/dec/09/west-ham-v-wolves-premier-league-live">by avoidable goals from Tomas Soucek and Jarrod Bowen</a>.</p><p>Wolves, who have the worst defensive record in the top flight, were on for a point when Matt Doherty equalised. Their inability to defend is why they are in trouble, though. It allowed West Ham to win it for Michail Antonio. This was bound to be a night of heightened emotions after the horror of Antonio’s car crash on Saturday. Although the forward survived, fans cannot help but wonder if he will ever play again after having surgery on a broken leg and it was difficult to know if the shock would affect West Ham’s&nbsp;focus.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com

India haven’t done so since 2008-09; England hadn’t managed it since 2007-08. The relatively modest praise for England’s achievement suggests New Zealand are condescended to in defeat as well as victory. If the first Test was a flawed slugfest, the second was a clinical demolition. England put a good New Zealand team under so much pressure – <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkLcfpK_V3Y">listen to how often the captain Tom Latham used that phrase</a> – that eventually they could take no more. In both games England perceived an early batting collapse as an invitation to go harder, a common occurrence in the first Bazball summer and a sign, when it comes off, of a team in rude health. It was also telling that, for the first time in a while, England’s players looked like they were having all ki
