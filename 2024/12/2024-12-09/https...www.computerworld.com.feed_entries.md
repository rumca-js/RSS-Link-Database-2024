<p>Microsoft’s Copilot Vision feature is now available for users to test in a limited preview.</p>



<p>Built natively into Microsoft’s Edge browser, Copilot Vision analyzes and understands the contents of web pages you visit. You can then ask the AI assistant for information and guidance about what appears on screen. </p>



<p>“It is a new way to invite AI along with you as you navigate the web, tucked neatly into the bottom of your Edge browser whenever you want to ask for help,” the Copilot team said in a <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot/blog/2024/12/05/copilot-vision-now-in-preview-a-new-way-to-browse/?_thumbnail_id=3834" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bl

<p>It might not be the biggest-selling or most expensive product in Apple’s basket, but a very important part of Apple’s future will be defined by <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3544306/what-to-expect-from-apple-this-october-and-beyond.html">the upcoming iPhone SE</a> upgrade in 2025. That’s because it is expected to bring in a new Apple-made 5G modem, impressive camera improvements, and support for Apple Intelligence. </p>



<p>And all of those will require more memory and a much faster processor.</p>



<p>To recap recent claims, here’s what we expect for the iPhone SE 4:</p>

<p>To train the <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/1627101/what-are-large-language-models-and-how-are-they-used-in-generative-ai.html">large language models</a> (LLMs) that power generative AI (genAI) technology, Microsoft and other AI companies need to use massive amounts of data. The more data, and the higher its quality, the more effective LLMs will be.</p>



<p>So it’s not surprising that Microsoft, OpenAI and other AI companies have become embroiled in lawsuits claiming they steal intellectual property (IP) from newspapers, magazines, writers, publishers and others to train their tools. It could take years to resolve the suits, but if the courts rule against AI companies, they co

<p>You might hear that 2025 will be the Year of artificial intelligence (AI) cybercrime.  But the trend really began in 2024.</p>



<p>AI crime will prove so overwhelming that some say the only way to fight it is through AI security software. But two incredibly simple, low-tech, and common-sense techniques have emerged recently that should become everyone’s default in business and personal contexts. (I’ll tell you about those below.)</p>



<p>First, let’s understand how the bad guys are using AI. </p>

<p>The US government has approved the export of advanced AI chips to a Microsoft-run facility in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), marking a significant step in the tech giant’s partnership with Emirati AI firm G42.</p>



<p>This decision comes despite earlier concerns from US lawmakers over potential national security risks, reported Axios.</p>
