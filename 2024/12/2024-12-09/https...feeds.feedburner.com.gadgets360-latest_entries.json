        "description": "Research published in Nature reveals that ancient galaxy collisions may have led to the creation of the universe\u2019s largest star systems. Using data from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), scientists studied over 100 galaxies undergoing intense star formation. These collisions are believed to have occurred 8 to 12 billion years ago, during a period of heightened galactic activity. The study suggests that the gravitational merging of galaxies caused gas to funnel toward their cores, triggering the creation of trillions of stars at rates far exceeding those in the Milky Way.",
