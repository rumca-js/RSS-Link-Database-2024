<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello everyone,</p> <p>I wanted to share an observation that might bridge the gap between classical mathematics and AI reasoning. During my experiments with models like GPT-4 and Claude 3.5, I stumbled upon something intriguing: <strong>combinatorics</strong>—the branch of mathematics dealing with combinations, permutations, and state spaces—can significantly enhance a language model’s ability to solve logic problems.</p> <p>Let me explain how I arrived at this.</p> <hr/> <h3><strong>The Problem</strong></h3> <p>I’ve been testing large language models with classic puzzles, such as the <strong>Wolf, Goat, and Cabbage</strong> problem:</p> <blockquote> <p>A farmer must transport a wolf, goat, and cabbage across a river using a small boat. The boat can carry only one item at a time. If left alone, the wolf eats the goat, or the goat eats the cabbage. How does the farmer transport all items safely?</p> </blockquote> <p>While seemingly simple, this proble
