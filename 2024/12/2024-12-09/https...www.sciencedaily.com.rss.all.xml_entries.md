Characterized by darkness and intense pressure, the ocean's hadal zone seems uninhabitable, yet dozens of unique organisms call it home. Each species discovered there adds a crucial piece to the puzzle of how life has evolved and even thrives in one of Earth's most extreme environments. A new study highlights one of those species -- the newly named Dulcibella camanchaca. This crustacean is the first large, active predatory amphipod from these extreme depths.

New observations from the James Webb Space Telescope suggest that a new feature in the universe -- not a flaw in telescope measurements -- may be behind the decade-long mystery of why the universe is expanding faster today than it did in its infancy billions of years ago.

## Astronomers find the smallest asteroids ever detected in the main belt
