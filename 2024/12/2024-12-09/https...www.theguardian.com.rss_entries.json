Alice has dreamed about being a star since was a little girl in Monterey, California, which Scorsese cheekily depicts as a rural idyll like The Wizard of Oz, only here her Over the Rainbow moment is a largely tuneless Alice Faye cover that leaves her fuming in frustration.

It\u2019s a poignant, belly-laugh-packed emotional journey that\u2019s crude, sweet, heartbreaking and has such an artsy vibe it wouldn\u2019t feel out of place at Sundance. Its glorious final season begins with a double bill in which Sam (Bridget Everett) looks into dog adoption while her erstwhile roommate Joel moves in with his boyfriend, Geoff.

Our writer explores \u2018the Athens of the prairie\u2019</p><p>Imagine growing up in a place where every stage of your life was framed by the best architecture of its day. You start out in an experimental elementary school, learning on a multi-level landscape of open-plan terraces connected by slides, before moving to a junior school where little towers of classrooms are linked by brightly coloured sloping tunnels. You spend your high school years in a heroic piece of brutalism, attend university in a sleek glass temple and go to church in a space-age tipi.<br><br>\n Your libraries, banks and even the local discount store are all the work of notable architects, and if your house is ever set ablaze, firefighters will come from a <a href=\"https://columbus.in.us/fire-stations/\">famous fire station</a>, designed by a Pritzker prize winner. If you end up in jail, rest assured",
