## How large is the performance gap between a Linux native game and a Windows game running through Proton?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>(Context: I have never gamed on Linux before) I was recently taking a look through the list of Linux supported titles on Steam and I noticed that it&#39;s pretty sparse (35k Linux supported titles out of 209k total titles). This got me thinking: for Windows titles that already work great via Proton, would there be any performance benefits if the game had a Linux version? Is there any incentive for developers to make Linux versions of their games if they already work great via Proton?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/aussierecroommemer42"> /u/aussierecroommemer42 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1hanxcc/how_large_is_the_performance_gap_between_a_linux/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1hanxcc/how_large_is_the_performance_gap_between_a_linux/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I went back to SteamOS after using Windows cause, unfortunately, some games didn&#39;t run as well. I at least got some mods with Sonic Adventure DX &amp; 2 to run right after being more careful about reading the directions on GameBanana. That aside, I was trying to set up Darksiders Warmastered to get the cutscenes working properly as I don&#39;t trust that Proton Experimental just magically made the cutscenes work again(I can&#39;t remember if the script in question fixed the missing button icons, though, but I opted to do this anyway to check). It took a few tries to get it started due to the root folder having to be swapped out with the steam folder in .steam, but not even a minute after it started, the Deck crashed and reset into SteamOS. It&#39;s supposed to take 30+ minutes to finish, mind you.</p> <p>So, I thought, &quot;Okay, I&#39;ll just start it again.&quot; It gave me the following.</p> <p>.</p> <p>.</p> <p>.</p> <p>windows6.1-kb976932-x

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>To preface, I&#39;m <em>not</em> having issues on Linux and I&#39;m not here looking for support on Windows, I&#39;m just curious as to what&#39;s going on and if anyone has any answers to sate said curiosity, since I&#39;m not really knowledgeable in these sorts of things. This is not a support thread.</p> <p>So recently, I started dual-booting Windows and PopOS, using Windows for unsupported games and Pop for pretty much everything else, and I&#39;m loving it. However, something HAS caught my attention: Steam utilizes my full download speed on Linux, I get my full, or close to, 1.5 gigabit download speed whenever I download anything through Steam. The Windows version, however, does not, and never has. Windows Steam caps out at 500 mbps rarely, and usually averages between 250 and 350 mbps. Well below my advertised 1.5 gigabit, and nothing I&#39;ve tried can get it closer to that. Again, I&#39;m not looking for suggestions on how to boost the Window

The audio on my computer otherwise works fine, and many games that can be run natively on Linux work fine too. The games that have the issue don&#39;t have the issue when played under Windows. It doesn&#39;t seem to happen with all games run under Proton, but quite a few, and some are worse than others. It happens with headphones, HDMI output, and laptop speakers. I have Pop!_OS 22.04.</p> <p>I&#39;ve also found the sound issues happening with another older Linux computer I have, with Linux Mint 22, an older gaming desktop that can play all the games fine on Windows, and the issue tends to be noticeably worse on that computer, but again the sound works fine on that computer in Linux in general.</p> <p>I&#39;m wondering if this is a common occurrence with Proton?
