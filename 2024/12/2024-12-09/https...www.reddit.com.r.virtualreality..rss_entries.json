Tracking issues started (I think) after I hit with one of the controllers in a wall while playing thrill of the fight. This was not a strong hit at all, and with my Rift S I slammed the living hell out of those controllers and never had an issue. Anyway, the quest now loses tracks of both of the controllers every like 5 seconds, and not tracking at all if they are move far away (when I am fully streching my arm). Anyone has similar issues / was able to fix ?

At 450mbps via VD, and a proper wifi setup, I noticed only slight compression in edge cases (Assetto Corsa). But honestly, I would take a little bit of compression any day then the mura on the PSVR2. Virtual Desktop also gives you access to spatial upscaling and sharpening to increase detail even further. </p> <p>The FOV on the PSVR2 is wider. I didn&#39;t measure it, but it was noticable. The fresnel lenses are actually very good compared to other fresnel lenses I have tried (Quest 2 and Index). Once you hit the sweet spot, the clarity is surprisingly close to the Quest 3 from a optical point of view, it&#39;s the actual display that hinders detail. Be sure t",

Recently, I&#39;ve gotten a HTC vive as another hand-me-down and I&#39;m wanting to know a few things.</p> <p>My device is a HTC Vive and it seems to have the grey logos on the wands. I&#39;ve seen that that can be important.</p> <p>- I really enjoy the finger tracking that the Oculus rift and touch has (for VRchat) and it seems the vive controllers don&#39;t support that. Do the Valve index controllers support that, and are the compatible with the vive I have? Are there any alternatives to this sort of finger tracking?</p> <p>- Is it worth upgrading to FBT on the HTC vive i have? If I upgrade the headset to a newer HTC model (Like the focus 3), would the FBT work with that too?</p> <p>Thank you for any help!
