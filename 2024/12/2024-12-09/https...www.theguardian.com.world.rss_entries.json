        "description": "<p>More heavy snow forecast for north-east this week, while South Africa endures third heatwave of summer</p><p>Winter is well underway across the pond in North America with two distinct lake-effect snow events taking place since Thanksgiving. Lake-effect snow is common across the Great Lakes region, and happens when cold air originating from Canada passes over the relatively warm waters of the lakes, causing the layer of air near to the surface to absorb heat and moisture. Warmer than the air above it, this layer of air then starts to rise, cooling and condensing into clouds which deposit snow on the windward side of the lakes.</p><p>In this particular event, an area of low pressure centred across eastern Canada dragged very cold Arctic air in from the north and plunged it into the north-east of the US. The dry, arctic air blew in from the north-west across the relatively warmer Lake Erie through Thanksgiving, picked up moisture and deposited snow across areas to the south and east ",
