When I click to let Microsoft know they’re unfamiliar login attempts, all it says is that there’s no need to change my password since the login attempt failed. </p> <p>I use a randomly generated strong password but I hate the feeling of knowing there are so many incessant attempts of cracking it.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I need to retake the OSCP, but I see that they just added modules on Hacking AWS Cloud Servers &amp; I no longer have access to the course material. I’m looking for alternative resources to learn this since I have 0 experience pentesting cloud servers, &amp; it may be on the upcoming exams.</p> <p>Does anyone know good places to learn this? I don’t see much on the CTF sites I normally use. TryHackMe has some premium course on it, but I don’t know if it’s worth paying for.</p> <p>Thanks for your time!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Agent-BTZ"> /u/Agent-BTZ </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1hah3yd/any_resources_for_aws_cloud_hacking/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1hah3yd/any_resources_for_aws_cloud_hacking/">[comments]</a></span>
