<p>High-flying <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2253770/what-is-python-powerful-intuitive-programming.html">Python</a> is expected to win the Tiobe programming language of the year designation for 2024, as the language with the biggest ratings increase in Tiobe’s language popularity index during the year. Python also ranks as the most popular programming language in the index overall. </p>



<p>Although Tiobe won’t reveal the actual winner until January, Python has had largest increase in ratings in the index in 2024, with a 10% increase. <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3491404/jdk-24-the-new-features-in-java-24.html">Java</a> has had the second largest, with an increase of 1

<p>Attackers have compromised Ultralytics YOLO packages published on PyPI, the official Python package index, by compromising the build environment of the popular library for creating custom machine learning models. The malicious code deployed cryptocurrency mining malware on systems that installed the package, but the attackers could have delivered any type of malware.</p>



<p>According to researchers from ReversingLabs, the attackers leveraged a known exploit via GitHub Actions to introduce malicious code during the automated build process, therefore bypassing the usual code review process. As a result, the code was present only in the package pushed to PyPI and not in the code repository on G

<p>Large language models by themselves are less than meets the eye; the moniker “<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3442188.3445922">stochastic parrots</a>” isn’t wrong. Connect LLMs to specific data for <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2335814/what-is-rag-more-accurate-and-reliable-llms.html">retrieval-augmented generation</a> (RAG) and you get a more reliable system, one that is much less likely to go off the rails and “hallucinate,” which is a relatively nice way of describing LLMs that bullshit you. Connect RAG systems to software that can take actions, even indirect actions like sending emails, and you may have something useful: <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/361146

<p><a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3689973/what-is-generative-ai-artificial-intelligence-that-creates.html">Generative AI</a> has hit the mainstream with software developers. According to a <a href="https://github.blog/news-insights/octoverse/octoverse-2024/#the-state-of-generative-ai-in-2024">recent GitHub survey</a>, more than one million developers actively use <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3609013/github-copilot-everything-you-need-to-know.html">GitHub Copilot</a>. More importantly, these developers increasingly use AI as “a new building block in developing applications.” In other words, AI is becoming just as important to software development as tools like <a href="htt

<p>In the last 10 years of building WaveMaker, the one thing we always hear are user expectations that <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3628183/what-is-low-code-development-faster-app-creation.html">low code</a> will miraculously allow business users to develop feature-rich applications. Well, it can, but it most certainly shouldn’t. I’ll tell you why. </p>
