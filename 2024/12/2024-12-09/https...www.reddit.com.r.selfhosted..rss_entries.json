Traffic for my sites goes through cloudflare dns with proxy for added security, but it only works with http/https. That&#39;s why I added port 25565 to npm for it to stream it to my pterodactyl server. And the problem is, that traffic through cloudflare works fine, but when I directly enter my ip, it refuses everything.

I want to expose it using https and I will hopefully receive an SSL certificate soon.

However, I have little (to not say zero) experience with webservers beyond local ones. There are some tutorials available, but they all differ in the details and I don\u2019t want to start trying out random stuff. Could anyone guide me a little on how to make this webapp available?</p> <p>Thanks anyone :)</p> </",

I think 2 drives with 4TB capacity running in RAID 1 should be enough for what I need in the next few years. I&#39;m looking at these two options:</p> <p><strong>- Synology NAS with 2 bays + 2 x 4TB HDD</strong></p> <p><strong>- Raspberry Pi + HDD docking station with mirroring function and USB 3.0 + 2x 4TB HDD</strong></p> <p>What are possible downsides of the second option? I&#39;ve seen that a NAS often lets you add a NVMe SSD as a buffer, but so far the speed of an external drive has been good enough for me. From what I&#39;ve seen, the USB 3.0 also wouldn&#39;t be a bottleneck.</p> <p>Would there be differences regarding the longevity of the drives? Differences concerning power draw?</p> <p> </p> <p>A bit more background:</p> <p>I&#39;m new to self-hosti",

Due to lag and other reasons i want to setup a straight reverse proxy without the vpn. But even after googling a ton i do not understand how to do this. My current understanding is that i have to port forward my home router, and then setup reverse proxy on my vps to forward all of that traffic.

I\u2019m hoping the community has some ideas on how to proceed in my situation. </p> <p>I\u2019ve started a home media server that is primarily used for Plex.

But after digging some more I learned that it&#39;s EOL. What are most people using now? (I am running MullVAD to test it out). I would run the PiHole with the vpn to act as a adblocker.</p> <p>Tailscale: From reading I should be able to use Tailscale IP to access all my devices but my question is if I can use Tailscale IP then do I need another VPN on top of that?</p> <p>Proxmox: The end goal of my setup is to use Proxmox to host all of my VMs. But my question is access. Do most people expose the Admin interface to the internet to access it remotely? What&#39;s the best option for this? Originally I was debating on using the Pi as entry point then from there accessing the Proxmox.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a hr",
