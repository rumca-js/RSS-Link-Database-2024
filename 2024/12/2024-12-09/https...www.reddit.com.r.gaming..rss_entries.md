<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Im rewatching all the Bond movies and it occured to me that it seems to be a severely under represented genre in gaming?</p> <p>Other than actual bond games which there haven&#39;t been any for years there really isn&#39;t any Spy Thriller style games. Sure there are espionage games like Syphon Filter, MGS, Splinter cell etc but they&#39;re much more spec ops commando style espionage. </p> <p>Where is the jet setting around the world, shmoozing with villians in casinos, infiltrating enemy organisations in plain sight, flirting with femme fatals, car chases with gadget filled cars, laser watches, shark pits, volcano bases games?</p> <p>It seems like such an obvious premise. Id imagine a mix of LA Noire and hitman with some Uncharted style action set pieces.</p> <p>Does anyone know of any games like this? Am I just missing them or is it severely under used as a premise.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/u

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>My five year old son loves video games and while I’ve tried a lot of different games with him, he always comes back to his favorite, which is Mario Odyssey. I’ve figured out what elevates it above everything else, which is the open world and yet sandbox design to it while keeping it young child friendly. There’s basically no way to play that game wrong. It’s a true open world sandbox that lets you do anything you want and eventually rewards you progression based on your exploration of the sandbox. There’s a simple story and objective, but the objective is incredibly simple: collect moons.</p> <p>We’ve tried some other games to varying success, but I’m looking for more options.
