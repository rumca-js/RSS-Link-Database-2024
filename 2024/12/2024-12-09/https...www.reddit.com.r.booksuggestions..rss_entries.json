I was only interested in stone ages, iron age, neolithic period, etc. like the really ancient times. </p> <p>Anyway, now I realize I don&#39;t actually know anything about anything lol. Like obviously I have an idea about these things but not enough to really understand why these things happened. I would love books that talk about general and similar political movements like for example revolutions that have occurred, civil wars, imperialism, slavery etc. Obviously these will all be non fiction but I don&#39;t mind fictional books like animal farm, the tattooist of auswitz that also tell you the story of the time period (if that makes any sense). </p> <p>Any suggestion would be appreciated!</p> </d",

It seems to me that in recent popular books it is terribly popular when the fmc is a police officer who falls in love with some mofia mmc who treats her like a toy. Well, this is exactly what I DON&#39;T want. I don&#39;t have a specific book I want. What I would like would be if the mmc was a detective and the fmc somehow involved in the case, I wouldn&#39;t mind if she was crazy or something. I&#39;m also open up for wlw or mlm books, with the mmc and fmc point I ment the idea of man treating woman as a toy and her loving it, I just really don&#39;t like this. And one more thing I DON&#39;T want are horror books, I&#39;m a terrible scarecrow and I&#39;m always scared, so something that won&#39;t keep me awake at night with a lamp next to my bed. Otherwise, I&#39;m open to all suggestions:)</p> <p>I don&#39;t know if anyone knows any book",
