<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am really getting interested in politics but I have a major blind spot when it comes to all this politics and history. I remember when I was studying history in school, I stopped paying attention when it reached all the world wars for only God knows why. I was only interested in stone ages, iron age, neolithic period, etc. like the really ancient times. </p> <p>Anyway, now I realize I don&#39;t actually know anything about anything lol. Like obviously I have an idea about these things but not enough to really understand why these things happened. I would love books that talk about general and similar political movements like for example revolutions that have occurred, civil wars, imperialism, slavery etc. Obviously these will all be non fiction but I don&#39;t mind fictional books like animal farm, the tattooist of auswitz that also tell you the story of the time period (if that makes any sense). </p> <p>Any suggestion would be appreciated!</p> </d

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hii. I don&#39;t know if anyone knows a book like this but lately I&#39;ve been wanting to read some crimi book. It seems to me that in recent popular books it is terribly popular when the fmc is a police officer who falls in love with some mofia mmc who treats her like a toy. Well, this is exactly what I DON&#39;T want. I don&#39;t have a specific book I want. What I would like would be if the mmc was a detective and the fmc somehow involved in the case, I wouldn&#39;t mind if she was crazy or something. I&#39;m also open up for wlw or mlm books, with the mmc and fmc point I ment the idea of man treating woman as a toy and her loving it, I just really don&#39;t like this. And one more thing I DON&#39;T want are horror books, I&#39;m a terrible scarecrow and I&#39;m always scared, so something that won&#39;t keep me awake at night with a lamp next to my bed. Otherwise, I&#39;m open to all suggestions:)</p> <p>I don&#39;t know if anyone knows any book

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This is a request, I remember reading in school in English class years ago a book which was about a person who was in the middle of a deserted place or something and he lived in some type of metallic structure or house or something. The key things that i remember are that that person had peach jam or some type of peach sweet food that he or she could eat and was valued. The pech jam was meantioned quite a few times making it seem as if was an important part of the book. I also remember that near the end, that person was running out of peach jam or something and he decided to take a risk and go seek for a nother life in the mountains with all his peach jam and in the mountains ended up planting and eating onions.

I&#39;m finding that I&#39;m dipping in and out of different books because they haven&#39;t grabbed my attention.</p> <p>I enjoy thriller/horror, sci-fi, and fantasy. I don&#39;t mind romance but I don&#39;t want a book where romance is the main plot line.</p> <p>I&#39;ve read Stephen King books before and I enjoy them but not looking for any more of his books right now. I did enjoy the Midnight Library a lot, and I&#39;m almost finished reading Thursday Murder Club.</p> <p>Please recommend me some books that grab you!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/_insomniac_dreamer"> /u/_insomniac_dreamer </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1h9xitg/next_book_suggestions/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><strong>Chapter 7: Falling Down</strong></p> <p>The next day at school, the tension in the air is palpable. I can feel it the moment I walk through the doors — the whispers, the side glances, the stifled laughs. Mike’s words from yesterday still sting, but I try to push them aside, telling myself I can handle it. I won’t let it get to me. Not today.</p> <p>I’m walking to my first class, head down, trying to keep a low profile. The hallways are crowded, but the voices are getting louder. A group of students is gathered around, talking animatedly, and I catch snippets of their conversation — some of it aimed in my direction.</p> <p>“Hey, it’s the <em>band kid</em>! Ludwig, right?”</p> <p>“Yeah, I heard he thinks he’s some kind of piano prodigy now. What a joke.”</p> <p>I grip my books tighter, but I don’t respond. I keep walking, pretending I don’t hear it, pretending I don’t feel the eyes on me. But it’s hard—every word they say stabs deeper than the

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><strong>Chapter 5: The Duet</strong></p> <p>The morning air is crisp, a light frost clinging to the grass as I make my way to school. The streets are quieter than usual, the usual bustle of students still a little while away. I reach the school building earlier than normal, my footsteps echoing in the hallways as I head straight for the music room.</p> <p>I’m already feeling a strange sense of anticipation in my chest. I’ve been thinking about Clara all night, replaying the way she played <em>Turkish March</em> and how her eyes met mine across the room. It felt like something — like a connection, even if it was just the music. But this morning, there’s something different. Something that tells me today might be the day I finally talk to her. Really talk to her.</p> <p>As I push open the door to the music room, I’m surprised to find Clara already sitting at the piano, her fingers gently tapping the keys in a rhythm I can’t quite place. She looks up as

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><strong>Chapter 3: Ode to Joy</strong></p> <p>The hours drag on as I sit through the classes, my mind wandering, my thoughts only half in the present. When the bell rings for recess, I feel a rush of relief. I meet up with Lukas and Felix, and we start joking around, our laughter cutting through the dull hum of the school. For a brief moment, I feel at ease, the weight of the morning&#39;s lessons slipping away.</p> <p>But then, out of the corner of my eye, I see her.</p> <p>A girl with fiery red hair stands by the lockers, clutching a sheet of music in her hands. She looks focused, yet there’s something graceful in the way she holds it, like she’s about to play a beautiful melody on an instrument I can’t yet see.</p> <p>“Right up my alley,” I think to myself, as I find myself drawn to her. There’s a kind of magic in the way she holds that music, like it could be the key to something great, something I might be missing.</p> <p>Suddenly, Lukas’s hand

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><strong>The Piano in My Blood</strong></p> <p><strong>Chapter 1: The First Movement</strong></p> <p>I am Ludwig Ledger, and I’m 14 years old. I live in Canada, with my German family. My dad, Emile, is 49, my mom, Emma, is 47, and my younger brother, Theo, is 13. We live in a cozy house on the edge of town, where the rolling hills and quiet streets always seem to whisper stories of the past.</p> <p>Music runs through my veins. It’s not just something I play; it’s part of who I am. I’ve been playing the piano since I could remember, my fingers instinctively dancing across the keys. Every day after school, before dinner, and sometimes even late into the night, I find myself sitting at the piano in my bedroom. My favorite piece to play is Beethoven’s <em>Moonlight Sonata</em>—specifically the third movement. There’s something about the way the notes flow, rising and falling, that speaks to my soul. The music fills me with a sense of both freedom and purp
