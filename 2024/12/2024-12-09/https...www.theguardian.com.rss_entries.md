<p>Bridget Everett’s gorgeous comedy bows out as it began: as a beautiful look at family, found family and, above all, friendship. If only HBO hadn’t cancelled it …</p><p>For anyone from a tight-knit small town who has moved away, the “what if I never left” question may be one that lingers in the mind. This is the story that fuels Somebody Somewhere, which stars the New York cabaret legend <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/28/bridget-everett-interview-somebody-somewhere-hbo-cabaret">Bridget Everett</a> as Sam, who moves back to Manhattan, Kansas, to nurse her sister as she dies of cancer, and ends up settling down, if you can call it that, in the town where she was born and raised. There has always been a sense that this show was fighting against the odds. It is a subtle and gentle tale in a TV landscape that rewards big bangs, and it is one of those beautiful, sad comedies that elicit the occasional belly laugh, but mostly leave behind a low-level hum of mel

<p><strong>Seven Dials Playhouse, London<br></strong>Tom Clarkson and Owen Visser’s anarchic evening has some bright ideas but may be more fun for those taking part than onlookers</p><p>‘A festive TV show live onstage,” promise multimedia double act <a href="https://www.wearething.co.uk/">Mr Thing</a>, and they’re qualified to deliver it: anarchic floorshows, performed as if for telly, have been Tom Clarkson and Owen Visser’s metier since establishing their fringe act eight years ago. Key to its cult status in Edinburgh, one suspects, is a late-night slot and a steady stream of comedian guests. Without either, this Christmas version, while never stinting on the anarchy and bright ideas, feels a bit more exposed.</p><p>That may strike you less if you’re one of those audience members (there are a lot of them about these days) for whom the spotlights are as comfy as the stalls. A half of the two-hour running time is taken up by audience participation, MC’d by try-hard Clarkson, as punte

<p>Team’s vulnerabilities were exposed again leaving more questions than answers over commitment to attack</p><p>It was another example of how things keep on conspiring against Ange Postecoglou and Tottenham. At least, that was how the manager wanted to frame it after the 4-3 <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/dec/08/tottenham-chelsea-premier-league-match-report">home defeat by Chelsea</a> on Sunday. At 2-0 up it was looking good but this is Spurs, where stability has proved elusive, where problems can strike at any time. Often at the best of times.</p><p>So it was that Cristian Romero had to go off with a thigh injury in the 15th minute. The influential centre-half had passed a fitness test, having missed the previous four games with a toe issue, and, of course, he just had to feel the new setback after an extravagantly risky backheel move inside his own area on eight minutes.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/dec/09/ange-postecoglou-tottenham-fo

<p>Sonia Bompastor continues to impress, Palace remain spirited and Liverpool’s formation switch backfires</p><p>West Ham may have got the better of Crystal Palace at Victoria Road but the WSL newcomers look far from destined for the drop. Palace took an early two-goal lead in the fierce wind before the Hammers rallied. By the break it was 3-2 to the home team and at the final whistle 5-2. Rehanne Skinner said afterwards that she does not think Palace will go down, comments Laura Kaminski took heart from. The south London side may sit bottom but they are in the mix, separated from Leicester only on goal difference and just five points from sixth place. “The team that went up last year [Bristol City] showed how difficult the gap is,” said Kaminski. “We’re in and around, before Christmas, the number of points they got on the board for all of last season.” She is right, Palace have five points, one away from the six accrued by Bristol across the course of last season.

 And what by mortals in this world is brought,<br>
 In Time’s great periods shall return to nought:<br>

 With toil of spright which are so dearly bought,<br>
 As idle sounds of few or none are sought,<br>
 And that nought lighter is than airy praise.<br>
 I know frail beauty like the purple flower,<br>
 To which one morn oft birth or death affords;<br>
 That love a jarring is of minds’ accords,<br>
 Where sense and will invassal reason’s power:<br>
 Know what I list, this all can not me move,<br>

<p>A scientist dates a medium in Michael Groom’s ambitious supernatural romance that interweaves a trio of timelines </p><p></p><p>This low-budget supernatural romance, directed by Michael Groom and co-written with his brother David, is both full of feeling and admirably ambitious with its trio of timelines. Taking place on three consecutive Christmases, it starts with one in which perky scientist Alice (Ines De Clercq) dates self-deprecating medium Jay (Samuel Edward-Cook), juxtaposing and scrambling these threads corroborates his notion that all time exists simultaneously. In his words, we inhabit a “block universe” – which makes it sound like he’s played too much Minecraft.</p><p>In the first timeline, we’re parked in the York heritage section of the block universe. Alice and Jay weave down the Shambles and up to Clifford’s Tower as their affair gets under way – though it’s almost scuppered as she struggles to accept his clairvoyance. When vignettes from the second timeline kick i

He was a tiny kitten with a cleft palate, runny nose and a chest infection.

I don’t much care if the targets are politicians or mafia bosses. It’s the method I despise. For those who are old enough to remember the killing of Patrice Lumumba, then JFK, then Malcolm X, then MLK, then RFK, every assassination is (I hate this word) a trigger. Assassinations are destabilizing. The shooting of Archduke Franz Ferdinand set off the first world war. Targeted violence has always been a sign – an augury – that the social order is breaking down. I would have preferred to see Osama bin Laden brought to justice so that we might have understood his methods and motives. I know that trials can be rigged, corrupted, biased, but so far the courtroom is the best place we have in which to decide between guilt and innocence – and to assign an appropriate punishment.

She made this discovery during an evening out with friends, but now in My Lesbian Novel she has found a way to express it in a novel as well. This is, as the title promises, a scorching lesbian romance, ending, as the best romances do, in bed, but throughout the book, scenes from the novel alternate with conversations between Gladman and an imaginary interviewer. Curiosity about the novel and curiosity about love wind round each other as she opens up about her structural dilemmas and girds herself to write the next scene.</p><p

<p>Fulham’s Antonee Robinson shines against Bukayo Saka, Tottenham squander another lead and woe at Old Trafford</p><p>There are numerous issues when taking over a team mid-season. One is that a new head coach might not have the right players for his plan and he has very little time to implement what he wants with those he does. Ruben Amorim has arranged his players – in various combinations – into his preferred 3-4-3 formation and it is clear what the strategy is, although there are flaws. The defence is struggling, where the three centre-backs are not performing their main duty of keeping clean sheets. Against Forest every set-piece looked like it might result in a goal. Only Nikola Milenkovic did score from a corner but the others were more farcical as André Onana got confused by Morgan Gibbs-White and a seemingly harmless Chris Wood header was allowed to drop in off the post. Maybe chopping and changing is Amorim’s issue and he needs to back a first-choice back three to allow the

<p>A new exhibition displays 40 years of work by the artist who stages scenes to painstakingly replicate the images in his mind – and some, he says, are definitely easier than others</p><p>Jeff Wall has long been championed as the master of slow looking. Back in 1985, the year before he turned 40, the British Columbia-born artist received a tip from a close friend. He had, by that point, published landmark scholarly essays, held professorships and made some seminal images, though not that many. His friend had seen a woman fall off her horse, and thought that was something Wall should photograph. “He said: ‘That kind of looked like a subject you could do,’ and I totally disregarded it because I just wasn’t interested at the time. But, two years ago, it came back to me.”</p><p>Over the past 40 years, Wall has utilised the speed and precision of photography to make exquisite, arresting works based on furtive moments just like this. Ask him how he decides what to shoot and he’ll likely s

In the evening, about 9:30pm UK time (30 minutes after midnight in Homs), I spotted the first video indicating that my home city was finally free from Bashar al-Assad and his forces. Then a friend shared a link of a man livestreaming from the New Clock Tower Square in Homs. I heard the zaghroutas of women; the chants of men: “There is no for ever. There is no for ever. Long live Syria and down with Assad.” People started gathering in the square, bringing the memory of the early days of the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Syrian-Civil-War/Uprising-in-Syria-2011">revolution in 2011</a>, when the people of Homs were inspired by their brothers and sisters in Tahrir Square in Cairo, Egypt, but innocent civilians were massacred by the Syrian regime.</p><p>Now 2011 and 2024 were meeting each other.

 Of all the underwatched series of recent years, this tale of a woman finding her feet after leaving the big city to return to her smalltown Kansas childhood home is top of the list. It’s a poignant, belly-laugh-packed emotional journey that’s crude, sweet, heartbreaking and has such an artsy vibe it wouldn’t feel out of place at Sundance. Its glorious final season begins with a double bill in which Sam (Bridget Everett) looks into dog adoption while her erstwhile roommate Joel moves in with his boyfriend, Geoff. Brace for an hour of glorious TV that runs the gamut from weepy to joyful – and features the filthiest rendition of She’ll Be Coming Round the Mountain you’re ever likely to hear. <strong>Alexi Duggins</strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.

<p>‘Brain rot’ is the Oxford English Dictionary’s word of the year – a fitting choice, given the startling impact the internet is having on our grey matter </p><p>If you want to witness the last vestiges of human intellect swirling down the drain, hold your nose and type the words “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzD9OxAHtzU&amp;list=PL-ZXraMeHBPJHXBhrNowJaQslyqtUg-tZ&amp;index=181">skibidi toilet</a>” into YouTube. The 11-second video features an animated human head protruding from a toilet bowl while singing the nonsensical lyrics “skibidi dop dop dop yes yes”. The clip has been viewed more than 215m times, and spawned hundreds of millions of references on TikTok and other social media.</p><p>Fitting, then, that the Oxford English Dictionary has just announced “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/dec/02/brain-rot-oxford-word-of-the-year-2024">brain rot</a>” as its word of year.

<p>Columbus, Indiana, is a mecca of modernism that still embodies the progressive ideals of its founders and star designers. Our writer explores ‘the Athens of the prairie’</p><p>Imagine growing up in a place where every stage of your life was framed by the best architecture of its day. You start out in an experimental elementary school, learning on a multi-level landscape of open-plan terraces connected by slides, before moving to a junior school where little towers of classrooms are linked by brightly coloured sloping tunnels. You spend your high school years in a heroic piece of brutalism, attend university in a sleek glass temple and go to church in a space-age tipi.<br><br>
 Your libraries, banks and even the local discount store are all the work of notable architects, and if your house is ever set ablaze, firefighters will come from a <a href="https://columbus.in.us/fire-stations/">famous fire station</a>, designed by a Pritzker prize winner.
