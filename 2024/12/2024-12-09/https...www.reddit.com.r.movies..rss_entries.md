<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>My viewing of Interstellar at the IMAX after 10 years since first watch. I think it may be top 3 movies of all time for me. </p> <p>First thing I want to say about it is how well it aged. This looks like a brand new movie still. Blown away by the effects and set design. Cinematography was top tier as well and it should set the bar. </p> <p>Now when I first saw this film, I was in my twenties and probably immature and didn’t care about drama in movies much. I didn’t appreciate the amazing storytelling and acting in this film. I couldn’t even remember most of these moments from the first viewing. I literally was tearing up at four separate times in this rewatch because of the writing and performances. It was beautiful seeing these character relationships developed in only 2 and a half hours. </p> <p>And can we talk about the score?! I can’t think of another movie that reaches this level of powerful, emotional music to move along the scenes, and connect

And what&#39;s showing on the TV? &quot;Angels With Filthy Souls&quot;. And it&#39;s right at the scene that Marv heard from outside the McCallister house. And when Harry and Marv hear the name &quot;Snakes&quot;, they both look at each other and realize it was a movie.</p> <p>That would&#39;ve been a nice little bit of business to end the movie with.

## The Nextflix animation The Sea Beast is better than almost every Disney film that's come out in the last 10 years.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Obviously the heavy hitters, Moana, Frozen, Brave, maybe Encanto, are all very good films, but The Sea Beast is hands down one of the best animations I&#39;ve seen.</p> <p>The visual effects are awesome, water hasn&#39;t been done better. The characters are well thought out and very entertaining, Karl Urban plays the role of Jacob very well. The soundtrack is excellent, and overall tone is suitably foreboding when it needs to be. The &quot;pirate speak&quot; could be better, but it is obviously aimed at kids.</p> <p>It&#39;s got a lot of the charm of the first Pirates of the Caribbean movie, and follows the time-tested Moby Dick format while staying fairly original. It&#39;s got a very classic feel that reminds me of the old swashbuckling pirate films of the 80s. Its a proper adventure film.</p> <p>Also, my 3yo boy is obsessed with it, so I&#39;d have to watch it whether I liked it or not. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="h

This guy was miserably failed by the justice system for the murder and r*pe of his daughter and wife, he took matters into his own hands and made sure every single authority figure who was involved in the case faced consequences.

Everything about this film is perfect. The documentary style narrative worked so well in this movie. Sharlto&#39;s character arc is simple yet so effective and beautiful. This is the most realistic film featuring aliens that I have ever watched. It made me believe that something like this can truly happen. To show aliens as refugees instead of invaders somehow felt so realistic and fresh.</p> <p>Another thing that I loved about the film was it&#39;s pacing. It&#39;s perfectly paced and never drags or dips in quality. The film has a runtime of 1 hr 56 mins but it felt like I finished it in 30
