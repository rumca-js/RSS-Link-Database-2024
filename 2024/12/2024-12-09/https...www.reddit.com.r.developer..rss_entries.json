I am interested in building a workout tracking app where you build up your character based on tracked workouts and then you can battle friends. Like I said, I have no idea where to start. If I were to hire a developer, how much would it cost and how would I do that? If I had to learn code, how long before I could even build the Home Screen, 2 years? I would love to hear would you all would do if you were looking to get your first app made.
