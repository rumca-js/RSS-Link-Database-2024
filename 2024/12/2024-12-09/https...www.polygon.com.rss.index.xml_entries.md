<p class="has-text-align-none">The days are short, cold, and far too packed with things to do. So let me help by adding a bit more to your to-do list this week with some television to add to your schedule.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Don’t worry, it doesn’t all have to be <em>appointment</em> (what is streaming good for, if not setting your own appointment TV viewing times?). It can be a little more leisurely and fit into your schedule — hopefully no one is spoiling <em>Great British Baking Show</em>’s holiday specials for you. (And if there is someone in your life like that: Don’t worry, the ghosts of Christmas specials past will be knocking soon.) </p>
