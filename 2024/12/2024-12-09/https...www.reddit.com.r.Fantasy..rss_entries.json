My journey through the past three and a half years has lead me to read the following book series in the below order. I was never really a fantasy reader and read historical fiction as a rule, and even though inaccurate they are a blast. Anyways back to the series I have read in the fantasy realm. </p> <ul> <li>The Witcher </li> <li>Malazan Book of The Fallen</li> <li>The Wheel of Time</li> </ul> <p>Out of the three I would say Malazan was hands down my favorite, and the series that has constantly left me thinking more about it, and relating to the characters even though I finished it roughly two years ago. I can probably thank the Reddit sub for that. Anyways, I was potentially going to do a re-read but I don&#39;t think my heart&#39;s in it yet (i.e., time dedication) and I know there are other books within that series, but I am feeling the benefits of a re-read before I move on to them.",

One of them is Dreams Of The Dying which was written by the lead developer of the Enderal mod for Skyrim and the other is Janus and Oblivion written by my favourite fanfiction writer. I loved both books but I think a large part of why I loved them is because of my biases as a massive Skyrim and Enderal fan and a fan of the second author&#39;s previous work. On a purely objective level, they don&#39;t stand up to a lot of the other books I read but I still love them a lot. So I was wondering which self-published fantasy book is your favourite?</p> <p>Also, I wanted to ask for some recommendations for books in that space. The Bound And The Broken and Sword Of Kaigen are both on my TBR (if I can ever find a physical copy of the latter) but other than that, I don&#39;t know much else.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/provegana69\"> /u/prove",

I already had a copy of Warbreaker and bought it with me to that trip too.</p> <p>The common consensus seems to be that Warbreaker is one of Brandon&#39;s best standalone novels and the one that you should read if you want to figure out if his books are for you or not. And since I just finished The Way Of Kings which I absolutely loved, I came into it with high expectations. Expectations which were unfortunately not met. Don&#39;t get me wrong, it wasn&#39;t a bad book, but it just didn&#39;t feel like the same quality as the Mistborn trilogy or the Stormlight Archive (I know the comparison is not fair as those two are Brandon at his best).

To incredibly briefly summarise: red rising but fantasy not sci fi and then put the setting as Ancient Rome, sprinkle in a magical school, a dash of hunger games and then have a magic system based around a pyramid scheme. </p> <p>I loved this so much. It took a while to read because it\u2019s a chonky book but it never felt like it took as long to read as it did. I usually read in 1 hour bursts and then do something else then come back. With this I was reading it in 3+ hour long bursts and was only putting it down because I wanted to savour the experience. </p> <p>I cannot wait for the sequel to this. I also want little side novellas about people just existing in this universe. I feel like every new setting there was space for a book just about that one place. There\u2019s so much packed in here. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Milam1996\"> /u/Milam1996 </a> <br/> <span",
