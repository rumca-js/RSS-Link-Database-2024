I recently made a post about sleeving game cards (and how often there won&#39;t be enough space in the box to accommodate sleeved cards). As such, given there&#39;s not always an elegant in-box solution, what are your recommendations for external storage solutions for single big-box games and expansions (sleeved cards only, assuming other components are left in their primary boxes)? Heroquest, Zombicide etc?

But do you ever think a game could be too generous at keeping everyone together?</p> <p>My specific example is Heat Pedal to the metal. I&#39;ve played 3 games of it now and every time every car is within 5 spaces of each other for 80% of the race. I like the game a lot but I&#39;m starting to get this feeling of only the last part of the board and the last turn actually matters. Our second game where everybody played differently, I went crazy and reckless, we had a slow player, we had 2 players who stayed in high gear but planned ahead and 2 all rounders. We always felt in the race and then literally 5 of us ended up past the finish line, on the same turn, in the same squares. I actually couldn&#39;t move 2 of my spaces because 4 cars were in the way. And the last person, the slow player was 1 turn away from also being here.</p> <p>I think I&#39;m being pessimistic here but this makes it feel like most of the game liter",

I\u2019m probably not the first to try this and it\u2019s probably been done better but here\u2019s what I did. After deciding a starting player, I took all of the power cards that cost 3 or less energy and say KEEP on them, shuffled them, and placed a number of them equal to the number of players plus one face up. Then, we each drafted one power card starting with the player last in turn order and ending with the starting player. </p> <p>The goal was to try and give each player a little bit of extra direction at the beginning of the game, and as I said, ultimately just to make everyone feel a little more powerful and the game more exciting . </p> <p>What do y\u2019all think?

Which I don&#39;t mind when the rest of the family is willing to play too. But as I said to him last night I would like some extra games that we can actually play together with just the two of us. So my go to two player games are generally 2 player abstracts and the chance of him wanting to play any of them is slim to none. (I have a friend who loves to play when we have time. So it&#39;s not like I&#39;m missing out on those.) And honestly I don&#39;t want to force him to play games that don&#39;t interest him. So I need help finding 2 player games (that may scale up so we can play with everyone 4 adults) that has the same sort of feel as Uno. So quick easy turns, pick a card and place it down. Very easy set up etc. He&#39;s not interested in complicated or thinky games. Just kinda likes to play. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.co",
