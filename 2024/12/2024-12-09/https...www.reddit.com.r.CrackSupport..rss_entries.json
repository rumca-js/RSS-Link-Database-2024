But the problem is I want to be able to apply PPF and download mods and maps (those highway ones like Shutoko Revival Project etc) but they all require CSP. I tried downloading it and got it as a file called lights-patch. I don&#39;t know if it was correct or not but after downloading through YouTube videos and ChatGPT I got an error saying no symbols were found. It said I needed 1.16.3 or 1.16.4 which according to Steamrip I had version 1.16.4. Some people recommended downloading from cs.rin.ru but it has Assetto Corsa Competizione not Assetto Corsa. Using CM can work but it tries to open steam and I don&#39;t have a legit copy so it really doesn&#39;t work. I just wanted to know if someone had an Assetto Corsa zip file with CSP included so maybe they can share it here or can someone help me setup AC with CSP correctly.</p>",
