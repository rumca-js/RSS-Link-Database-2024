## Quick & Dirty Video of my Prototype Wireless Controller System

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This is a very quick video showing my prototype wireless controller system for the Amiga. While modern USB adaptors make it easy to connect modern USB mice, controllers and keyboards, this setup allows you to use original Amiga keyboards, mice and controllers. It consists of a sender, into which you can plug standard Amiga keyboards, mice, joysticks, control pads etc. and runs on a lithium battery, and a receiver that plugs into the native ports on an Amiga.</p> <p>Currently it works mostly fine, lag is tolerable, generally introducing around 20-25ms (between 1 and 2 frames). It was tested with a SWOS tournament and there were no complaints about lag, so I&#39;ll take that as a good sign :)</p> <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fPeal6LnE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fPeal6LnE</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Daedalus2097"> /u/Daedalus2097 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www

## Trying to get Sim City 2000 working on PUAE

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone,</p> <p>I have been craving to play Sim City 2000 (Amiga version) on PUAE. I can easily get it working on Amiga Forever and have even created a bootable HDF file with Workbench 3.1 but when I try to fire up the game in PUAE off of my Gaseous Games web server, I get the dreaded no DH0: error message. I have spent hours googling and reading up on how to get this working and I am just not able to figure out why the error message is coming up.</p> <p>I have all of the verified ROM/BIOS files for the emulator and several other games just work great - especially those in LHA format but for some asinine reason, I cannot get this game to work. I would appreciate any help or advice. I am new to Amiga, as I only had experienced it from a friend who had one (I only got to play on c64 and IBM compatible PCs way back when Amiga was out). </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/technofox01"> /u/technofox0
