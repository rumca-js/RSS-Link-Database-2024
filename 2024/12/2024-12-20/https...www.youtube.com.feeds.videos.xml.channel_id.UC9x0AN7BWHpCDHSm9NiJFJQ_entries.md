Build your Hacker Dropbox with Twingate (it’s free):  https://ntck.co/twingate_ztna

In this video, we’re building a Hacker Dropbox, a device that can be dropped into any network and give us remote access. This can pretty much be any device, including a Raspberry Pi…which is what I’ll be showing you. And no….it’s not using VPN, it’s ZTNA (Twingate) which is much more secure and easier to setup. Why do this? If you’re like me, you are by default the helpdesk support of every circle you’re in. I am that for my church, my parents, my grandma…and I need a very quick and easy way to remotely access these networks…even when I don’t know the subnet info. This is where the Hacker Drop box comes in handy, operating as a magic device for remote IT support. It also doubles as a penetration testing tool, giving pentesters easy access to a remote network in seconds.
