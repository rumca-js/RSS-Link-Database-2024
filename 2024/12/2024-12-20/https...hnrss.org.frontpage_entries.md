<p>hi hn - i'm volunteering at Stanford next quarter to co-teach cs 153 (infrastructure at scale) - a course i wish had existed during my undergrad years. rather than pure theory, it's focused on how large-scale systems actually work in production<p>the format combines hands-on projects with a speaker series. we've confirmed some solid speakers (Jensen Huang from NVIDIA, Matthew Prince from Cloudflare etc), but i'm also keen to bring in perspectives from folks who don't fit the standard mold. tbh, many of the best systems eng/devs/infra ppl i've worked with are pretty weird - they think differently, take unconventional paths, and often learn by obsessively building and breaking things rather than following traditional routes. i think it would be cool for the students to realize its a feature, not a bug, to be weirdly obsessive<p>if you're interested in this kind of stuff, i'd value your thoughts on:<p>1/ who are the fascinating/unsung heroes in infra/systems eng that students should

<p>For the longest time, I've been interested in the idea that the personal data we have logged across platforms can "paint" a pretty clear picture of who we are. And, as individuals, this will reveal fun and maybe sharable stories about us.<p>So I made this app, Day by Data, to connect with and visualize your personal data like step count, music listening habits, and more into tiny visualizations and data art right on your iPhone.<p>The launch version has a few year-in-steps breakdowns and a few Spotify data-visualizations.<p>Over time, the goal is to make more data sources available to connect and empower users to learn from their personal data stored across these platforms. Think data about the food we eat, places we travel, or shows we watch.<p>Data accessibility and cleanliness is the hardest part, but I'm always open to different sources and visualization types.<p>Let me know what you think and if there are certain data sets you'd like to see visualized!</p>

## Show HN: Interactive graphs in Rerun with a Rust port of D3-force

<p>Rerun 0.21 comes with a new graph viewer that's written in Rust and runs in the browser via wasm. It's powered by a new force based layout engine that is a port of much of d3-force to Rust. (The release also contains some other cool stuff like undo/redo implemented on top of a timeseries DB.)<p>We built this with applications in robotics and spatial computing in mind but would love to hear feedback from folks that would see this as useful in other domains as well.</p>

<p>Hello! I'd like share about my sideproject <a href="https://gribstream.com" rel="nofollow">https://gribstream.com</a><p>It is an API to extract weather forecasting data from the National Blend of Models (NBM) <a href="https://vlab.noaa.gov/web/mdl/nbm" rel="nofollow">https://vlab.noaa.gov/web/mdl/nbm</a> and the Global Forecast System (GFS) <a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/weather-climate-models/global-forecast" rel="nofollow">https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/weather-climate-models/gl...</a> . The data is freely available from AWS S3 in grib2 format which can be great but also really hard (and resource intensive) to work with, especially if you want to extract timeseries over long periods of time based on a few coordinates. Being able to query and extract only what you want out of terabytes of data in just an http request is really nice.<p>What is cool about this dataset is that it has hourly data with full forecast history so you can use the dataset to train and fore
