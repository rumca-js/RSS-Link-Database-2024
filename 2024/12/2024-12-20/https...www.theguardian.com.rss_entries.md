<p>Ben Stokes seems wary of using the word ‘ruthless’ but it is the one thing talented players need to become a truly great team</p><p>Sometimes I feel this England team can’t take two steps forward without doing something that makes me think they’ve gone backwards. So much progress has been made, so many reasons for optimism provided before a year that is likely to define them.

Thank goodness female artists like Paula Rego and Esther Strauss provided a reality check</p><p>How much do you know about the Virgin Mary? Go to any Catholic country, church, institution or European museum, and her image is inescapable – as the idealised, obeisant, chaste, beautiful woman.

<p>Some in the industry have been calling for recognition for years, but motion-capture performances by the likes of Zoe Saldana have been ignored. Now, though, the Academy must look to the future</p><p>Picture the future: it’s the Oscars 2034, and the best actor prizes are no longer split into male and female categories. Instead, there is an award for best performer in a live action role, and another for best actor in a performance capture role. Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks can finally go head-to-head for their epic turns in Sophie’s Choice II and Even Bigger respectively, while Zoe Saldana and Andy Serkis are up for the latter for their startling performances in Avatar 6 and The Lord of the Rings: What Gollum Did Last Summer.</p><p>Some might suggest this is a tantalising vision of a world where the Academy has finally caught up with the realities of modern acting. Others would no doubt point out that the Oscars has been rewarding work where the actor’s real face is obscured by makeu

<p>From the devilish Krampus legend to a spot of disembowelment, the author takes us on a scary romp through Europe’s most disturbing festive folklore</p><p>Shaggy figures with snarling masks and metre-long horns, scenes of wild drunkenness, random assaults on&nbsp;strangers, witches winding your intestines out on a stick, a giant “Yule Cat” who will eat you if you’ve failed to put on new clothes for the day – no, it’s not your annual family get-together, at least I hope not. It’s a compendium of European seasonal lore from the dark side, as explored in&nbsp;this excellent short book by historian and folklorist Sarah Clegg. She combines a trove of good stories with a serious critique of earlier mythographers’ ideas about them, and also takes us on adventures ranging from pre-dawn graveyard walks to the terrors of Salzburg’s pre-Christmas “Krampus night”, named for the monstrous masked figures who prowl its streets on 5 December.</p><p>Clegg approaches Christmas by a broad avenue, so

<p>He has bankrolled elections, stoked riots and ignored laws. We mustn’t make the mistake of playing nice with the world’s richest bully</p><p>Elon Musk is, more or less, a rogue state. His intentions are self-serving and nefarious, and his nation-state level resources allow him to flout the law with impunity. To put it into context, if dollars were metres, Musk’s money would be enough to take him to Mars and back, while a mere millionaire could only make a round trip from Paris to Amsterdam.</p><p>The sheer immorality of any one person possessing so much wealth is obvious to most people with basic amounts of empathy. But when it comes to Musk and <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/only-15-people-whose-wealth-110902775.html">the other 14 people</a> worth more than $100bn, the morality of it is almost a secondary concern.

<p>The smash-hit Korean drama is back at long last – and there’s a funny, spicy romcom to tuck into. Plus: lots more crackers to catch up with over Christmas</p><p>The first game may be over but the desperation underpinning it is stronger than ever; there will always be another group of victims forced into risking everything by society’s inequities. As the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/sep/28/squid-game-the-hellish-horrorshow-taking-the-whole-world-by-storm">smash Korean drama</a> returns, everyone left standing is bearing the scars. Most troubled is the victor, Gi-hun (Lee Jung-jae), who is determined to put a stop to the winner-takes-all contest – at the cost of making the ultimate sacrifice. Squid Game’s satirical, polemical intentions feel foregrounded this time round and there’s arguably too much expository prologue. But as the brutal action begins, the themes of impotence in the face of unaccountable power have lost none of their resonance. <br><em>Netf

<p>Bournemouth look to repeat Old Trafford heroics, Saints must get ugly and it’s Füllkrug time for West Ham</p><p>Approaching the halfway point, it is hard to gauge where Aston Villa are at. Regardless of Manchester City’s extended wobble, a result at home to Pep Guardiola’s side will go a long way to providing an indication. It was always going to be a big ask for Villa to better or even equal last season’s achievements but, with automatic qualification to the Champions League last 16 a distinct possibility and a top-four finish within reach, it has been another solid, if imperfect, start. Only once this season have Villa recorded victory after a European night, in September after winning at Young Boys. This time last season Villa were third in the division, two points off the summit, on 35 points. They may be 10 points worse off now but, despite defeat at Nottingham Forest last time out, they remain in a good spot. <strong>Ben Fisher</strong></p><p><em>Aston Villa v Manchester Cit
