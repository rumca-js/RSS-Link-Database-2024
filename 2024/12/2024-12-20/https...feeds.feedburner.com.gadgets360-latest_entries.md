A study published in The Astrophysical Journal has shed light on how the Sun’s magnetic field influences solar wind acceleration. Using data from the Parker Solar Probe and Solar Orbiter, researchers observed that sharp magnetic switchbacks smooth out into gentler waves as they travel further from the Sun. This relaxation process transfers magnetic energy into kinetic energy, speeding up solar wind particles. The findings, led by the University of Michigan team, offer critical insights for improving solar wind forecasts and understanding space weather impacts on Earth
