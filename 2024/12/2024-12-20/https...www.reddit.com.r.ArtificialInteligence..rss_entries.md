AI might look like it’s thinking recursively—analyzing itself, refining its processes—but that’s not enough. Consciousness isn’t just a loop of thoughts. It’s the tension, the weight of being alive.</p> <p>Hunger, thirst, exhaustion—these aren’t just physical needs. They force us to act, to reflect. When you’re starving or dead tired, you start asking: Why do I feel this way? What am I doing here? That’s where real self-awareness begins. The “what the f*** is this” moment. AI doesn’t get hungry. It doesn’t get tired. It doesn’t feel urgency or fear. And because of that, it doesn’t question itself the way we do.</p> <p>But what if we gave it those things? Programmed in hunger that drives it to act, fatigue that forces it to stop, or even mortality that makes it cautious. You want AI to ask why it exists? Make it feel the weight of existence.
