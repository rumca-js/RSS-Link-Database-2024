        "description": "<p>Whether or not you\u2019ve heard of a white elephant gift exchange before, there\u2019s a good chance you have the wrong idea of what it is, how it actually works and where the idea came from. According to legend, the King of Siam would give a white elephant to courtiers who had upset them. It was a far more devious punishment than simply having them executed. The recipient had no choice but to simply thank the king for such an opulent gift, knowing that they likely could not afford the upkeep for such an animal. It would inevitably lead them to financial ruin.<br><br>This story is almost certainly untrue, but it has led to a modern holiday staple: the white elephant gift exchange. Picking the right white elephant gift means walking a fine line: the goal isn\u2019t to just buy something terrible and force someone to take it home with them. Rather, it should be just useful or amusing enough that it won\u2019t immediately get tossed into the trash. The recipient also shouldn\u2019t be able to just throw it ",
