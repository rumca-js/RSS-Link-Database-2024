        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Crazy question. Of course I want to hook up my Atari 2600 and 7800 and who knows what other old console, to my 4K TV. What is it.. retroyink, OSSC,etc. they&#39;re all different, some are supposed to be good at some art. They can be pretty pricey, especially if you&#39;re not getting what you want. So I have a question </p> <p>Is it not possible to get some kind of a simple RF signal booster so that you can plug the thing directly into the cable connector and put it on channel two or three and get an image that works?
