        "description": "Learn more about artificial intelligence \u2192  https://ibm.biz/BdGX3z\n\nIs pre-training a thing of the past? In Episode 34 of Mixture of Experts, host Tim Hwang is joined by Abraham Daniels, Vagner Santana and Volkmar Uhlig to debrief this week in AI. First, OpenAI cofounder Ilya Sutskever said that \u201cpeak data\u201d was achieved, does this mean there is no longer a need to model pre-training? Next, IBM released Granite 3.1 with a slew of features, we cover them all. Then, there is a new way to steal AI models, how do we protect against model exfiltration. Finally, can NVIDIA Jetson for AI developers really increase hardware accessibility? Tune-in for more! \n\nSubscribe for AI updates \u2192 https://ibm.biz/BdGX3q\n\nSegments:\n00:01 \u2014 Intro\n00:49\u2014 Is pre-training over?\n10:25 \u2014 Granite 3.1\n22:23 \u2014 AI model stealing\n33:38\u2014NVIDIA Jetson\n\nThe opinions expressed in this podcast are solely those of the participants and do not necessarily reflect the views of IBM or any other organization or entity.",
