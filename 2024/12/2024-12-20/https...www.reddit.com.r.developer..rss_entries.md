<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>As a CS student i want to sell websites as a service. What business model works for you guys? How do you guys charge? Also how do you handle hosting? Do you charge them for the year of hosting aside for development price? If you charge a recurring fee how much? After the year of hosting how do you recharge them? What makes a coded website better than Shopify(as a developer i know how it can be better, but how do i sell the customer?). Why would a customer pay me $50-$150 a month on top of hosting when they can go do wix or Shopify for $35. Or why pay me $300 or $1500 if they can get wix or Shopify for $35</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/TechCoderr"> /u/TechCoderr </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1hir8i9/web_development/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1hir8i9/web_development/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am seeing it&#39;s really an interesting option to develop an app in Bolt.New however I don&#39;t wish to speak about the validity of that in this post- at least not yet. I am always coming from a deployment being tricky mentality. For example I have seen that Vercel is easy to deploy to and I guess is similar to Netlify. However I feel that the risk is traffic draining my bank card with these done for you servers.</p> <p>So I am bringing this question to anyone experienced in this. I did administer my own Digital Ocean VPS once and it tok valuable time from me but at least I had control of the spend. Or was that an illusion also? Is that also going to be an issue. Yes it maybe nice to have a busy app but I can imagine these AI code bases may not be the best put together. I see them as a MVP generator.</p> <p>Or any other paths I should look at? My background is front end dev and then I created my own small self employed website design business. I

Along the way, I integrated the <code>wa-automate</code> library to send messages programmatically through a POST route handled by my Express server. When the server receives a request, it parses the information and sends a message to a group chat I created for job vacancies. This way, I’m helping developers find jobs more easily.
