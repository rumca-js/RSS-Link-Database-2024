In the shadows of the Israel-Gaza and Ukraine-Russia conflicts, another war is raging in the Red Sea and the West is on the front line. Houthi rebels have turned one of the world’s most critical trade routes into a shooting gallery. Thousands of miles away, distress calls from targeted vessels are routed to the U.K. Navy’s response center for maritime trade operations. 

WSJ visited the UKMTO headquarters in the U.K. to understand why the West is still at war in the Red Sea and how the U.S. and its allies are trying to wrestle back control of these vital waterways.
