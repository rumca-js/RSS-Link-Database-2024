## RISC V will die because there is no standards in place for how the *cores* should work and only the instruction sets are open source and it means it'll be messy to support and optimise application for RISCV architecture.

## Is RVV0.7.1 still be used?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>With RVV 1.0 now considered the stable version for development, Iâ€™m wondering if RVV 0.7.1 is still in use. There are hardware platforms that support RVV 0.7.1, so do legacy projects still rely on RVV 0.7.1, or are they considering migrating to RVV 1.0? Is it possible that developers might need to roll back RVV 1.0 code to RVV 0.7.1?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/hhhazelnutLatteee"> /u/hhhazelnutLatteee </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1hi9z3v/is_rvv071_still_be_used/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1hi9z3v/is_rvv071_still_be_used/">[comments]</a></span>
