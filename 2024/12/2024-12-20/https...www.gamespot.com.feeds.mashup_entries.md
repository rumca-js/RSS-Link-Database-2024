Final Fantasy VII Rebirth and Stellar Blade were two notable examples of PS5-only games releasing this year--they're both headed to PC in 2025--while other studios released must-play titles like Metaphor: ReFantazio (our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metaphor-refantazio-is-gamespots-game-of-the-year-2024/1100-6528323/">Game of the Year</a>), Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree, and Silent Hill 2 on the Sony system.</p><p dir="ltr">

<p>Video game adaptations are rapidly becoming Hollywood's next big Marvel move, with multiple, decent adaptations releasing every year now (we're not going to talk about Borderlands). Director Tim Miller (Deadpool; Love, Death &amp; Robots), however, puts this trend to the test in a very interesting way: Instead of using source material from one property, why not create an anthology series featuring multiple--and seemingly, extremely random--IPs as a love letter to the industry itself? That's exactly what Secret Level attempts to do.</p><p>Secret Level is Amazon Prime Video's new animated anthology series where each episode is an interesting, original take on a different video game franchise. Some episodes were highly anticipated as they feature some historically iconic properties such as Mega Man, Pac-Man, and Warhammer 40K, while other segments focus on properties so odd, they can seem like some sort of weird advertisement or make you think, "Who is this even for?"

<p>Very few basketball players are good enough to make it in the NBA, and that alone places Cleveland Cavaliers shooting guard Donovan Mitchell in rare territory. Unfortunately for Mitchell, his skills on the battlefields of Call of Duty don't seem to be the equal of his skills on the basketball court.

<p>Ubisoft has released a new game called <a href="https://edenonline.ubisoft.com/">Captain Laserhawk: The Game</a>, which is a top-down multiplayer shooter that utilizes NFTs and blockchain technology. It's currently in early access on PC and somehow features Rayman.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/500114/ubisoft-nft-game-captain-laserhawk-game-file">Game File's Stephen Totilo</a>, the game is based on the Netflix show Captain Laserhawk: A Blood Dragon Remix, which itself is based on the Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon spin-off. In Captain Laserhawk: The Game, Rayman is simply the announcer for deathmatches, so he's not actually playable.</p><p>The game requires players to have a Niji Warrior NFT to play. A Rayman profile picture can also be purchased for 750 virtual coins and attached to your Niji Warrior NFT. That's pretty much the extent of Rayman's involvement in this game.

<p>Sonic the Hedgehog 3 is now in theaters, and the biggest new addition to the cast is Keanu Reeves in the role of Shadow the Hedgehog. Director Jeff Fowler has now discussed what he wanted from Reeves when he was cast in the part and how Reeves ended up nailing it.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/12/jeff-fowler-sonic-the-hedgehog-3-keanu-reeves-shadow-jim-carrey-robotnik-knuckles-1236206882/">Deadline</a>, Fowler said Sonic 3's story changed the tone of the film series to become a little more mysterious with the introduction of Shadow. Whereas Sonic, played by Ben Schwartz, is a "motormouth" who is full of "manic energy," Shadow is the total opposite.</p><p>"Sonic is saying 100 words a minute while Shadow might say five words in an hour. He's a much more closed book, more mysterious, brooding. Itâ€™s this kind of yin and yang with Shadow and Sonic. There's a really great opportunity, narratively, to have an almost bizarro version of that Sonic origin story," Fowl
