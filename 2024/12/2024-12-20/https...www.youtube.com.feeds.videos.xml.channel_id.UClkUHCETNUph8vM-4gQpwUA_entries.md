Horned Warrior's Sword Build - Dual Sword Duelist Shadow of the Erdtree Build (Elden Ring Build)
In this Elden Ring Build Guide, I’ll be showing you my Dual Sword Duelist build. This is a Shadow of the Erdtree build that takes place after level 150. If you’ve been looking for a Dexterity-Faith Curved Sword build that lets you one-hit mobs from afar then you might want to check this build-out.
