The Forever Winter is a single-player and co-operative extraction shooter that takes place in a post-apocalyptic world that has been ravaged by a never-ending war that has been going on for four decades. The twist, however, is that instead of putting players into the shoes of a super soldier with a giant arsenal, the game instead has players take on the role of scavengers looking for ways to survive. 

While offering up incredibly tense experiences, The Forever Winter does have a major drawback in one of its core mechanics: Water Death. The fact that there’s a constant ticking clock that might force players to play the game even when they don’t want to is an unnecessary level of pressure that the game puts on players. The fact that the mechanic has seen revisions since release, however, is also evidence of the fact that the studio is listening to its players, and that future updates might make this one particular painful point go away.

Hype can be dangerous - ask anyone who looked forward to Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, Skull and Bones, and other failures from earlier this year. While it's cause for excitement, especially with the coming years offering so many top-tier releases to look forward to, it can also lead to disappointment.

However, with the sheer range and quality of games en route, it's difficult not to get hyped. Monster Hunter players get a new mainline title. Metal Gear Solid fans will see the series' revival, even if it's a remake. And, of course, the launch of a new Grand Theft Auto in GTA 6, which almost everyone looks to revolutionize the industry and genre in many ways.

Will there be disappointments? Undoubtedly, but if there was ever a time to get hyped for the future of gaming, it's right now. Check out 30 of the most anticipated games of 2025 and beyond here.

Stalker 2’s launch may have been hindered by an abundance of bugs and technical glitches, but there is no denying that even the mere existence of such a product is nothing short of a miracle. GSC Game World have been working on Stalker 2 through difficult conditions and challenges and to have a visually stunning and a mostly functioning open world game launch is something that deserves to be applauded. 

We at GamingBolt are huge fans of the Stalker series and absolutely loved Stalker 2 but there is no denying that it launched with certain issues which had to be addressed by the developer. Not too long after the game’s launch, the developer promised they will be addressing all the game’s issues through a series of patches and so far, it seems GSC Game World are making good on those promises.
