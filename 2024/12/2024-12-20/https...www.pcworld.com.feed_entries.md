<p>Live TV streaming services are a natural starting point when you’re cutting the cord.</p>



<p>These services offer many of the same channels you had with cable or satellite TV, but deliver them over the internet to your smart TV or streaming device. They include cloud-based DVRs so you can record your favorite shows—and skip through the commercials—in many cases, they’re the only way to watch specific pay TV channels.</p>



<p>Still, the cost of live TV streaming services can get quite high, and in some ways they won’t be exactly like what you had with cable. Our top picks will help you avoid overpaying and get the TV features you most care about.</p>

<p>We just found the perfect way to level up your New Year’s party: this <a href="https://www.amazon.com/JBL-Partybox-Encore-Essential-Built/dp/B09VMPBBY5/">JBL PartyBox Encore Essential speaker is down to $200 on Amazon</a>. That’s a whopping $100 off its original price (was $300).</p>



<p>This party speaker is large and in charge, measuring 11.54 inches long, 10.87 inches wide, and 12.87 inches tall. I may or may not have bought one myself for Christmas, and I may or may not have tested it out before wrapping it up with a nice bow. But I will say, it’s awesome.</p>



<p>The PartyBox Encore Essential is loud enough for both indoor and outdoor parties, and it’s especially great for pool parties with its IPX4 splash-proof design that’ll keep it safe against accidental water exposure. I’m frankly already excited about my upcoming summer get-togethers.</p>
