<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’m not a lesbian, but this makes my mom laugh so hopefully someone here finds it funny too. I first heard about lesbians in 4th grade. A boy my age said “Sometimes girls date. They even have sex.” I had no idea about sex, and I doubt he had any real idea either, but this made me think. I’d never seen girls together so I thought “One of them must just become a guy” but then I thought “I’d hate to be a guy. How do they decide who has to become the guy???” and I decided that lesbians must have to battle (rock, paper, scissors seemed most fair) to decide who has to become a guy. It good to know now that you guys to NOT have to battle or become guys.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Mermaid-88"> /u/Mermaid-88 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/1hird2w/i_used_to_believe_lesbians_had_to_battle_each/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comme

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>It’s honestly so painful and scary to see just how much my ‘people’ despise lgbt for no reason other than being different, and to this day is still don’t understand why it’s getting worse. Like yeah I don’t understand the viewpoint of a trans person, but why is it so hard just to leave them be, cause they’re happy? It’s been so depressing to see this happen before my eyes to who are factually ‘my kind’. I just can’t see myself being with these people anymore. I just kinda want to meet more lgbt people and just be a friend. No girl likes me, and they probably definitely won’t cause I’m too ‘woke’ for them, but honestly I don’t care anymore. Is there anything I can do to just try and help? Make things better? The absolute state of masculinity in our society is terrifying and I don’t want to let myself fall down that rabbit hole.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Kawakanai"> /u/Kawakanai </a> <br/> <s

I have no problem with who she is and whatever makes her happy my only concern is her having a relationship at a young age. Back to the main point, my mom has been urging with me to talk to my sister and tell her it’s not the right thing to do, she’s not angry abt the revelation but she’s very upset and has been very annoying/indenial (“maybe she’s just influenced by her bff” “she’s v girly so why” yk usual things they say). I don’t know how to explain to our mom that even if we talk it through or if she scolds my sister, it won’t change a thing and will just make her keep secrets abt herself. I’m not rlly sure about how to approach this situation. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Dry-Particular-5786"> /u/Dry-Particular-5786 </a>
