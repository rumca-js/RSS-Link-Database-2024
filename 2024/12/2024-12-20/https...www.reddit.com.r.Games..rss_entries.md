<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>As part of their usual holiday giveaways, Astrea is today&#39;s free game on epic games store today! For people who like risk management in their roguelike deck builders this one is a blast, it goes heavily into &quot;kiss/curse&quot; design where every dice has negative sides as well as positive ones, but that said it still gives you so many tools to try to use those negative dice faces to your advantage.</p> <p>It offers 6 classes and several build options within each character, adding a good deal of replayability (although the enemy variety could be better) not to mention the art and music are quite pleasant. Personally this was my favorite deckbuilder of 2023 (yes I liked it more than Wildfrost). Even if you are a bit sceptical about a dice builder, for $0 I would recommend giving it a shot.</p> <p><a href="https://store.epicgames.com">https://store.epicgames.com</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.co
