In this video I have colorized and upscaled footage from 1911 in New York City. The footage is originally from MoMA (Museum of Modern Art) and the Swedish Company Svenska Biografteatern. They traveled all the way from Sweden to USA in 1911 to document the giant city of New York.

✅ Colorized
✅ Upscaled to 4K
