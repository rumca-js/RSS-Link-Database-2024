## I built a quick app that lets you clone your voice and chat with yourself. The AI becomes more like you the more you talk to it - took me about an hour, happy to share code!

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello! I work for local news agency and now have a task to research and apply a podcast AI solution that generates podcasts. Not specifically English ones.</p> <p>I want to find mature solution that is easy to integrate - about as easy as OpenAI Library. Is there any SaaS for such case?</p> <p>Also I am curious about technical moments, e. g. how long podcast they could generate without falling to hallucination? What server should be needed in case of self-hosted solution? Or what price do I usually (if that term even applicable to such bleeding edge field of rapid growth) pay for cloud API?</p> <p>The best option (my dream) is to organize a 24/7 or at least 12/5 radio audio channel streaming online on all possible platforms.</p> <p>I am glad to see any technical details as well as business cases.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Kenya-West"> /u/Kenya-West </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.redd
