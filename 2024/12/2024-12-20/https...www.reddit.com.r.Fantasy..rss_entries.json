Both are set in a post-industrial revolution age (Howl&#39;s moving castle is set in the nineteenth century, whilst Termina&#39;s story takes place after the game world&#39;s equivalent of the second world war. I reeeally suggest you check them out both to understand what I&#39;m trying to say!) I feel like there aren&#39;t enough works set in this period, which is sad since the genre is saturated with medieval fantasy that can get boring really quickly.

I am now nearly a quarter into this reread and everything about this story is genuinely leaving a bad taste in my mouth. I hate the character Sire Galan, and the writing rambles way too much with absolute made up nonesense to make it sound medieval. It is a big pile of nothing much in my opinion. The pacing is super slow and it lacks adventure/action with an added season of characters being terrible people.

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>My favorite thing about Harry Potter is the feeling of wonder and mystery that Hogwarts induces. I love the setting of a vast, maze-like castle that can be cozy or dangerous, depending on the circumstances, and feels like a home where all of your friends live. I think this feeling is most prominent in the earlier books when the characters are younger and the stakes lower. I guess basically anything featuring a boarding school ripe for exploration and adventure and with a strong sense of home, friendship, comfort, etc. Preferably in a less modern setting. The only thing I have found that is sort of like this is Little Witch Academia. It can be anything: movies, games, books, manga, etc.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/bestgirlcoco\"> /u/bestgirlcoco </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1hi8ml1/anything_to_make_me_feel_the_way_early_harry/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <spa",

It\u2019s a beast fable (like Animal Farm or Watership Down) that draws its inspiration from medieval stories and Christian themes (but it neither proselytizes or makes explicit references to Christianity so don\u2019t let that dissuade you). </p> <p>The story takes place in a world without humans where animals can talk and lands are ruled by roosters. An evil threatens one particular rooster (on the way to trying to destroy the world).</p> <p>I listened to the Audible version and I think the author\u2019s drawing upon medieval texts really shines here as it felt like a work that really works when recited orally.
