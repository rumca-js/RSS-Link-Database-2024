The study has important implications for understanding the origin of these vents and assessing their global-scale impact on the Earth-Ocean system. The study also has implications for understanding and searching for habitable environments, and potentially even life on other ocean worlds in our outer solar system, according to the study's authors. The surprising results found from detailed deep-ocean studies at Polaris call into question how much we really know about the nature of seafloor venting along all ultra-slow spreading ridges on Earth which remain largely unexplored but make up 25% of the global ridge crest.",

The stacked rookie class and solid supporting cast of series veterans is much too deep for a team in its third season of Xfinity Series competition to make a run. But if everything comes together, both parties could see their partnership pan out. For Burton, 2025 is the start of his comeback trail as he seeks another Cup Series opportunity. For AM Racing, it's an opportunity to learn from a driver who has reached the top rung of the NASCAR ladder, and an opportunity for a relatively inexperienced team to grow.",
