<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I guess there are alternatives, but this service was super easy to setup (just install, start systemd service) and it just works. My desktop now never freezes. Some tabs die, VSCode dies when I debug some ungodly nodejs app, but my linux memory management problems (which were significant), are over.</p> <p>I know installing it by default would pose problems, but freezeups cause more problems for the regular user IMO. So I hope distros adopt some service like that by default at some point.</p> <p>And no - swap does not really solve that problem. Yes, if my computer was running a mars rover it would be better to have it slow down instead of die. But in practice having your desktop run into swap renders the machine unusable anyway. And most modern apps save their state often enough to not lose valuable work.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/vko-"> /u/vko- </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.
