<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Im looking for suggestions on not a specific kind of memoir but generally like on Political Leaders, Government workers, Top wealthy individuals, impactful people. People like John Rockefeller, Rothschilds, Hitler, Freemasonry, government workers like psyop &amp; cia agents is an interesting one, id like to learn more about MK Ultra, etc. Even some history that isn&#39;t so close, doesn&#39;t exactly have to be the actual persons memoir but a book with artifacts, etc. it would be interesting to learn about some ancient civilizations like Babylon &amp; Rome. I&#39;ll read and find some takeaways in anything that has factual information in it, regardless of its opinions of the book.</p> <p>Thanks</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Saxo1"> /u/Saxo1 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1hiwht4/historical_interesting_memoirs/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’ve been in a reading slump recently and need a good book to get me out of it but I seem to be so picky over the book. I don’t think I like fantasy, I like romance but it can’t be too cheesy or too smutty. I’m good with no smut either but I do love a romance. Love a thriller. Even young adult. But I can’t seem to get a book that’s really pulling me back into reading!

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I like books that make you think about life, how people act in certain situations, nature, etc. Not a fan of high fantasy or books that feature a lot of romance or smut. And shorter chapters are a plus so I&#39;m not overwhelmed, but not a must.</p> <p>The last books I remember reading are Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? - Philip K. Dick, Coraline - Neil Gaiman, The Circle - Dave Eggers. So dystopian books or one&#39;s with a darker twist are definitely welcome, but just purely philosophical ones or any other suggestions are also greatly appreciated.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SuspicioussSnake"> /u/SuspicioussSnake </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1hiu4n1/please_help_me_get_back_into_reading/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1hiu4n1/please_help_me_get_back_into_reading/">[comments]</a></s

Bonus points if it resolves in one or two books (gone are the days I could make it through WoTs 15 chonkers). </p> <p>I’m really not interested in typical “YA” predictable type novels with Mary Sue protagonists and overly muscled male model love interes

I am wanting to get back up on the horse for 2025 and want to avoid getting bogged down like I did this year. I started 5 books this year that I have not finished. I have really enjoyed some novellas and how quickly I can read them and feel accomplished and not get bogged down. I&#39;m wanting to fill my 2025 tbr with them maybe. Any suggestions are welcome. I do tend to read literary fiction and not genre so keep that in mind. I also have been developing a soft spot for translated latin american literature. </p> <p>Here are some Novellas I&#39;ve read and enjoyed:</p> <p>The Invention of Morel by Adolfo Bioy Casares</p> <p>Augustino by Alberto Moravia</p> <p>Venus in Furs (Have not read, but will probably be adding to the 2025 tbr)</p> <p>Some novels I&#39;ve adored:</p> <p>Normal People</p> <p>The Bell Ja

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Just read “do androids dream of electric sheep?”</p> <p>I’m a really big movie buff so I thought I would read the inspiration for the original blade runner movie.</p> <p>I wasn’t put off the fact that the book isnt the same as the film, the film being one of my favourites.</p> <p>But I tend to read alot of books that were than made into movies. Like I say in the title I want to move away from my comfort zone more.</p> <p>I’ve read Carrie, the gunslinger (Stephen king), the man in the high castle, treasure island, fight club, Frankenstein, planet of the apes, animal Farm and 1984. </p> <p>I’m quite new to reading, or a beginner at least. I started with my love for dystopian futures. I think ones that are written in the past that relay a lot of comparison to modern day life extremely interesting.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m proud of myself, I actually completed my TBR pile this year! So now I&#39;m working on a new one. I haven&#39;t really read anything released within the last 5 years. So I&#39;m trying to build a new TBR list for next year! If you guys could help, I&#39;d really appreciate it!!!</p> <p>The types of books I enjoy are: *Romance (not hyper-smut, but don&#39;t mind a heated seen &amp; 1-2 smut scenes) *Mystery &amp; Drama (they go well together or separate) *Fantasy (my favorite) *Horror (mostly Stephen King) *Mythology (either actual myths or fiction based off myths)</p> <p>I prefer historical settings... Ancient Japan, Ireland, Europe, etc. I am also not a huge fan of the technology based future setting type stories. I like things that involve witchcraft/magic, vikings, elves, samurai, astrology, etc. </p> <p>What I currently have on my new TBR: *The Stars are Dying *When The Moon Hatched *The Wren In The Holly Library *The Disney Villains Seri

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m looking for books with the same concept as, &quot;The Summoning,&quot; by Kelley Armstrong or the elementary book series about 4 girls and 4 guys that have to go on the run to escape their sleeper cell camps that I can&#39;t remember the name of. Books where it&#39;s a group of people that have to escape a bad place and go on the run. Not dystopian per se, supernatural would be nice, but I can&#39;t seem to find any along these lines.

One dealing with multicultural perspectives and the other about adolescent literature.

I know life really isn&#39;t easy for anyone right now and college is all about learning to balance responsibilities, but I have a lot of first generation students, students with learning disabilities and mental health issues, and students who have to work full time and/or take care of siblings and other family members. It&#39;s so important to me to try to be inclusive, help all my students succeed, and develop a love for reading (if they haven&#39;t already!). </p> <p>It would be great to teach works that really appeal to them.
