<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello! I&#39;ve bough No More Heroes on sale. I wanted to play the game with my dualsense. The game recognizes the controller if I disable Steam Input. But, the mapping is all weird. Like X is R3 and etc. </p> <p>This game has this weird mapping issue on Windows as well, which can be fixed by emulating xbox controller through DS4Windows, apparently.</p> <p>That&#39;s where I found SC Controller(a linux alternative for DS4Windows). I somehow made it work with <code>SC Controller</code> but it felt weird, but it worked only once and never worked other times I tried it.</p> <p>I also tried to use SC Controller and disabling steam input all together for the whole steam through <code>-no-joy</code> flag for steam but still the game thinks that it&#39;s not a xbox controller(i need to press R3 for X again).</p> <p>Is there a workaround i can do to make the game work properly with dualsense?</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <

Yeah, I’ve installed and uninstalled games here and there. And in the beginning, I definitely played around with installing packages to find the best alternatives for Windows programs. But for the most part, I’ve been uninstalling programs I don&#39;t actually use. Same with games—if I’m not playing it anymore, I uninstall it. Early on, I didn’t always remove unused dependencies and repos properly, though.</p> <p>So yesterday, I went through and cleaned that up. Got rid of all the unused dependencies and repos, did some general housekeeping—emptying the trash, deleting unused files, and so on.</p> <p>According to Filelight, I’m currently only using 450GB, wi

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>It feels like there&#39;s so little info on how to actually play video in HDR. I gather that you need HDR universally enabled on Plasma 6+ and it sounds like you specifically need MPV as a video player.</p> <p>Could someone please fill in the blanks for any requirements beyond those? Or could you point me to an article?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ITstudent3"> /u/ITstudent3 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1hicedm/hdr_video_on_plasma_6/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1hicedm/hdr_video_on_plasma_6/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m currently running on a laptop with an Intel I5 7200U and an Nvidia GeForce 940MX which I do know is not at all great. I&#39;m currently on Linux Mint 22 the Nvidia driver version 535 which has given me slightly better performance compared to 550 and 470, but I am completely baffled as to why my performance has been worse compared to Windows (averaging 22 FPS on LM and 35 FPS on Windows). I have gamemode enabled, and there is pretty much no difference between x11 and wayland drivers. CPU usage tops out at around 80-90% with GPU usage at 90-100%, pretty much the same for Windows and LM. I would also like to add that I&#39;m on the lowest settings at 720p. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/LukasTheHunter22"> /u/LukasTheHunter22 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1hiblgu/how_can_i_improve_my_performance_on_dying_ligh
