To keep ashes in and to take with us on our journey through life.<br/> It seemed like a good plan until we tried it out. It breaks easily at the neck and around the feet. It was not designed for printing but to move around in a video game.<br/> I have a Blender file and a stl file if needed.<br/> I know next to nothing about it myself, so any advice is very welcome.</p> <p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/o4gwmbpzc08e1.jpg?width=872&amp;format=pjp
