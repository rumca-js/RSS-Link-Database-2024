They even have sex.\u201d I had no idea about sex, and I doubt he had any real idea either, but this made me think. I\u2019d never seen girls together so I thought \u201cOne of them must just become a guy\u201d but then I thought \u201cI\u2019d hate to be a guy. How do they decide who has to become the guy???\u201d and I decided that lesbians must have to battle (rock, paper, scissors seemed most fair) to decide who has to become a guy.

Like yeah I don\u2019t understand the viewpoint of a trans person, but why is it so hard just to leave them be, cause they\u2019re happy? It\u2019s been so depressing to see this happen before my eyes to who are factually \u2018my kind\u2019. I just can\u2019t see myself being with these people anymore. I just kinda want to meet more lgbt people and just be a friend. No girl likes me, and they probably definitely won\u2019t cause I\u2019m too \u2018woke\u2019 for them, but honestly I don\u2019t care anymore. Is there anything I can do to just try and help?

Back to the main point, my mom has been urging with me to talk to my sister and tell her it\u2019s not the right thing to do, she\u2019s not angry abt the revelation but she\u2019s very upset and has been very annoying/indenial (\u201cmaybe she\u2019s just influenced by her bff\u201d \u201cshe\u2019s v girly so why\u201d yk usual things they say).
