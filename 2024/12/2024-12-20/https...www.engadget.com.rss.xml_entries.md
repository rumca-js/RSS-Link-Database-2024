<p>Another day, another Tesla recall. This time, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/?nhtsaId=24V935000"><ins>informed the owners</ins></a> of almost 700,000 Tesla vehicles warning them of a problem with a warning light for the tire pressure monitoring system as reported by the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://apnews.com/article/tesla-musk-recall-cybertruck-e78b0f3421c538a3f0bb4bba0bda0549"><em><ins>Associated Press</ins></em></a>.</p>
<p>The recall affects the 2024 Cybertruck, 2017-2025 Model 3 and 2020-2025 Model Y Vehicles. The NHTSA says the warning light for the tire pressure monitoring system may not stay illuminated between drives.</p>

## James Bond (the movie franchise, not the spy) may be in deep jeopardy

<p>Movie icon and super spy James Bond seemed to be on another rise to the top of the box office just a few years ago, but things have been almost as quiet as a shot from a Walther PPK with a silencer ever since then. Daniel Craig took on the role in 2006 with <em>Casino Royale </em>and passed the baton with 2021’s <em>No Time to Die</em> in one of the most heart-wrenching endings in Bond’s cinematic history (you cried, just admit it)<em>.</em></p>
<p>The only thing sadder is the reason why we haven’t seen a new Bond movie since then.</p>

<p>Instagram is still thought of as a feed of algorithmically-suggested photos first and foremost, but the app is also pretty popular for messaging, too.

<p>When Intel debuted its <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/intel-arc-a750-a770-review-mid-range-gpu-rivals-nvidia-amd-130032507.html">first Arc video cards two years ago</a>, I was more than a little skeptical. Could a company that famously gave up on its last major desktop GPU project in 2009 actually make a dent in a market dominated by NVIDIA and AMD? Well, when I reviewed them in 2022, the Arc A750 and A770 turned out better than I thought, though they were also held back by Intel's poor drivers. But it seems Intel has learned from its mistakes.</p>

This five-piece surround system includes four identical satellite units and a single 6.5-inch subwoofer. All told, it ships with 13 speakers spread across the five units, each of them wireless.</p>
<p>The company says this system has been “purpose-built to complement” extra-large screens, with Hisense announcing its the perfect companion to its own TVs that are 85-inches or bigger. The HT Saturn is especially feature-rich, as it’s compatible with both Dolby Atmos and DTS:X technology.</p>

## The 7 best white elephant gifts that are worth stealing

<p>Whether or not you’ve heard of a white elephant gift exchange before, there’s a good chance you have the wrong idea of what it is, how it actually works and where the idea came from. According to legend, the King of Siam would give a white elephant to courtiers who had upset them. It was a far more devious punishment than simply having them executed. The recipient had no choice but to simply thank the king for such an opulent gift, knowing that they likely could not afford the upkeep for such an animal. It would inevitably lead them to financial ruin.<br><br>This story is almost certainly untrue, but it has led to a modern holiday staple: the white elephant gift exchange. Picking the right white elephant gift means walking a fine line: the goal isn’t to just buy something terrible and force someone to take it home with them. Rather, it should be just useful or amusing enough that it won’t immediately get tossed into the trash. The recipient also shouldn’t be able to just throw it

If you're gifting for a tech fan, something from Apple, Google, Samsung or another big brand is always at the top of the list. But be prepared for sticker shock once you look at the price tags for their latest and greatest devices. Thankfully, you don’t have to spend hundreds of dollars to get a gift for someone that has all the cachet of a brand they know and love.<br><br>Apple, Samsung, Sony and other big tech companies all have affordable gear that comes in at $100 or less, you just have to know where to find them. These are some of our favorites, but remember: you can often find alternatives that are just as good (and sometimes better) than these. However, for the people in your life for which brand names really do matter, these gifts will speak to them.</p>

<p>The holiday season has barely begun, but some of us are already getting ready for CES 2025. Shortly after New Year’s Day, many from the Engadget team will be packing our bags to fly to Las Vegas, where we’ll be covering tech’s biggest annual conference. As usual, our inboxes are already flooded with pitches from companies that are planning to be there, and our calendars are filling up with appointments for briefings and demos.</p>
<p>Based on our experience, as well as observation of recent industry trends, it’s fairly easy to make educated predictions about what we might see in January. Over the years, the focus of the conference has spanned areas like TVs, cars, smart home products and personal health, with a smattering of laptops and accessories thrown in. At CES 2025, we expect to see AI get even more pervasive in all areas of the show floor. But we are also likely to get the usual slew of new processors and subsequent laptops, as well as all manner of wearables, trackers, bat

<p>This week, we're looking back at our hellish 2024 and trying to figure out where to go from here. We began the year with enormous hype around artificial intelligence, but that's cooled off after seeing how useless many AI features have been. It's also clear that many companies, including Microsoft and Apple, are trying to push half-baked AI concepts onto users. Looking forward, we're expecting a rough few years for the tech industry (not to mention the world as a whole).</p>

## The Morning After: Google accused of using novices to fact-check Gemini’s AI answers

<p>Last week, Google allegedly instructed contract workers evaluating Gemini not to skip any prompts, regardless of their expertise, <em>TechCrunch </em>reports based on internal guidance it viewed.</p>
<p>Now, contractors have allegedly been instructed <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-accused-of-using-novices-to-fact-check-geminis-ai-answers-143044552.html">not to skip prompts</a> that “require specialized domain knowledge” and to “rate the parts of the prompt you understand,” adding a note that it’s not an area they have knowledge in. Apparently, the only times contractors can skip now are if a big chunk of the information is missing or if it has harmful content.</p>
<p>Google filed a statement to Engadget, saying its raters “perform a wide range of tasks across many different Google products and platforms. They provide valuable feedback on more than just the content of the answers, but also on the style, format and other factors.”</p>
