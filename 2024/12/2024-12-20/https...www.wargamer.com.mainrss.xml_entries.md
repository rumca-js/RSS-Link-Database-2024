								<p>The Modern Horizons 3 <strong>Magic: The Gathering</strong> card, Tamiyo, Inquisitive Student, is spiking in price thanks to a surge of play in Modern. This card was already pretty pricey thanks to various high-powered Legacy and Vintage decks, and sat at $20 at the start of the week. Since then it’s seen a sharp rise of 140%, and according to the tracker on MTG Goldfish, the Mythic Rare is currently valued at quite an expensive $47.90.</p>
