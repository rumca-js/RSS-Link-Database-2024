## Help with Fitgirl Repack's Red Dead 2 (BUILD 1491.50) modding

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I downloaded RDR2 from Fitgirl Repacks and decided to mod it. I&#39;ve done it before (downloaded from the same site after following the fixes online) and it has worked in the past, but now, for some reason, it doesn&#39;t seem to work. I think its some sort of incompatibility between Lenny&#39;s Mod Loader&#39;s vfs.asi file and any ASI loader I can find online (regardless of if it&#39;s Scripthook&#39;s dinput8.dll or any version.dll), which causes the game to sometimes drop frames significantly.</p> <p>The game works fine after deleting either files (vfs.asi or dinput8.dll/version.dll), but, of course, neither the mods in the LML folder nor the ASI script mods work. I ask here in the case that maybe someone can tell me if the issue is Fitgirl Repacks&#39; current repack of RDR2, and if I should download it from someplace else, or if it is simply an issue of the current RDR2 build available right now. Any help to get it to work would be greatly app

I’ve tried different things like turning off windows virus protection/firewall. Limiting installation to 2GB ram and it still crashes.
