That\u2019s a whopping $100 off its original price (was $300).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This party speaker is large and in charge, measuring 11.54 inches long, 10.87 inches wide, and 12.87 inches tall. I may or may not have bought one myself for Christmas, and I may or may not have tested it out before wrapping it up with a nice bow. But I will say, it\u2019s awesome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The PartyBox Encore Essential is loud enough for both indoor and outdoor parties, and it\u2019s especially great for pool parties with its IPX4 splash-proof design that\u2019ll keep it safe against accidental water exposure. I\u2019m frankly already excited about my upcoming summer get-togethers.</p>\n\n\n",
