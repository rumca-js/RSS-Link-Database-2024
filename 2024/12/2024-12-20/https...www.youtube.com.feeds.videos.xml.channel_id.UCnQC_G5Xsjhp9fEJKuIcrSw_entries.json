        "description": "PureTalk - Exclusive discount for our listeners at: https://www.PureTalk.com/Shapiro\n\nBen discusses that large company founders in the U.S. are wildly optimistic about the next four years because the new administration isn\u2019t going to talk about how a business needs to be punished for its success. Under Trump, we can look forward to a more robust economy through the solidification of foreign policy. Trump believes America and American citizens come first, which is why he thinks the government should calibrate its actions to the level of interest the American public has in things. President Trump wants to get us back to some sense of normalcy, but this won\u2019t come without obstacles in the House and Senate. Everything he wants will require a compromise. However, the reality is being gradually accepted; politics is a coalitional game, and you\u2019re not going to get everything you want. \n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Click here to join the member-exclusive portion of my show: https://bit.ly/3WDjgHE\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 It\u2019s your LAS",

While Waltz is in the throes of planning for the transition, he shares his foreign policy priorities and proposes a vision for the revival of American strength abroad. Waltz offers his perspective on the fate of NATO, and why domestic American energy is an essential component of American foreign policy. He also discusses what Middle East diplomacy might look like after the Abraham Accords, and how outer space and cybersecurity are part of his policy calculus as well.

Our government has existing incentive structures, and we still have checks and balances. Every bill Republicans bring forward, such as the current spending bill, will have compromises, yet the basic idea seems to be that every compromise is a sellout. Ben also talks about the House Ethics Committee, which is set to release its report on former congressman Matt Gaetz this week. He also interviews the ADF CEO and President, Kristin Waggoner, about the new Center For Free Speech, where she talks about their mission and the first battles they will take on.\n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Click here to join the member-exclusive portion of my show: https://bit.ly/3WDjgHE\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 It\u2019s your LAST CHANCE to take advantage of our best sale of the year!
