<img src="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/winter-mechanical-keyboard-shootout-new.jpg?width=1920&height=1920&fit=bounds&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp" /> <p>Well, we're into the month of December, and temperatures are beginning to get close to freezing here in old England-land. What I've decided to do, in lieu of the cold weather, is take the time indoors to review some more keyboards, although this time with a focus on smaller choices that are rather interesting. Yes, I really am a nerd.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-the-winter-mechanical-keyboard-shootout-four-tiny-options-put-to-the-test">Read more</a></p>

## Space Marine 2 on PS5 Pro: a much-needed image quality and performance upgrade

As of patch 1.5, PS5 Pro boosts performance in its 60fps speed mode and addresses the (at times) blurry image quality in that very same mode. Speed and quality modes both use PSSR in place of the original FSR2 method to improve image quality, while also pushing the internal resolution on each mode higher and targeting a 4K output resolution. In brief: on quality mode we now get a 1080p to 4K range as the input resolution, while on speed mode that range adjusts to 1080p-1440p.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-space-marine-2-ps5-pro-a-success-for-image-quality-a
