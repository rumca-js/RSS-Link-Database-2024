<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m haven&#39;t really done a lot of research on VR or really used any, besides one of my buddies quest 2. I really don&#39;t have the money to spend on a proper VR headset, basically everything related to technology that is imported from overseas costs like 3 times the price where I live. I also mainly play games on PC and not on console.</p> <p>I&#39;m just curious if its worth getting an old VR headset like a PSVR1, they don&#39;t go for much around here, or if I should get like a proper secondhand sim-free phone, with a gyroscope and put it in one of those VR gear headsets. I saw that through some applications you are able to use it with steamVR, but I&#39;m not sure how viable that is. I don&#39;t plan on using any VR controllers, mainly just the flight stick or joystick for flight simulations. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/These-Carry4807"> /u/These-Carry4807 </a> <br/> <span><a href

So here is my first impression/review of the game. </p> <p>Let me start off by saying that the game looks absolutely fantastic on the psvr2 and really sets the atmosphere and mood from the second Alien movie. So if you are a fan of the series I can easily recommend it you. The game definitely has some odd mechanics which holds it back from becoming 10/10. For example when aiming down sights, your pulse rifle or shotgun will automatically lock on your shoulder, which feels really unnatural. It’s a shame cause the weapon models look AAA high quality and faithful to the source material. </p> <p>Thankfully, you won’t be aiming down sights much, as most of the shooting is done up close and from your hip. And shooting from your hip feels great, as you have full control of your weapon and the adaptive triggers, controller rumble is

I am 16 years old and have had a quest 2 for around 2 years now and just started playing it again a couple months ago after I had not been playing it for around a year or so (if that makes sense). Anyways, my parents are scared that it can cause cancer and other harmful things to my eyes, my brain, and give me tumors. I play Beat Saber most out of all of the games and I play for around 20 minutes a week. My mom says that it is very much and that I shouldn’t play for that long since it is extremely bad for me without having any evidence to prove it. She says that there is not enough research that has been done to VR in general and that people in 10 years will see that it will be as harmful as smoking is. She thinks that it will be the same as the situation where nobody thought smoking was bad for you, until they found out. She also does not like that it is so close to my face. Is there any way I can prove to her that I won’t die from playing

## Should I get a Quest or a Valve Index ?

Or a different headset entirely ?&quot; also since my PC technically does meet all the other requirements , is there a way for my PC to let the Quest use like my CPU, RAM and/or storage with the air link or cable ? or is the entire computation process depending on the PC when you connect it ? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/NoBee4959"> /u/NoBee4959 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1hiqlmw/should_i_get_a_quest_or_a_valve_index/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey folks, so back around boxing day 2018 or so, I bought myself an Oculus Rift headset, I upgraded my computer with an rtx2060 to play games and I had a great time. However, I recently did a massive overhaul of mu computer, I replaced the 2060 with a 4070TI super, replaced my old Ryzen 5 with a new Ryzen 7 and sone other upgrades including a new power supply that can handle more than what&#39;s currently installed. </p> <p>I hooked up and set up my old Oculus Rift and the performance is ABYSMAL, it can barely run anything, the lag is nauseating and even the most basic programs in VR which could be handled with ease before now cause my computer to go into meltdown and the VR crashes. With non-VR games the PC&#39;s upgrades all work perfectly and gaming is silky smooth, but with VR it&#39;s terrible. </p> <p>Can anyone tell me what could be causing this and if there are any fixes? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www

Dev here with a feature concept I&#39;m considering that might solve one of our biggest pain points, especially for movement-heavy games. </p> <p><strong>The Core Concept</strong></p> <p>Imagine being able to instantly swap between full VR immersion and a third-person &quot;pancake AR&quot; view mode where you can play with traditional controller inputs. Not just a spectator mode - a fully playable alternate state that lets you keep gaming when your body needs a break.</p> <p><strong>Technical Reality</strong></p> <p>The implementation is surprisingly straightforward - most VR games already have third-person camera systems and full-body avatars for things like multiplayer or recording footage. The main challenge is control mapping and animation. For instance, my game has 12 distinct gesture-based abilities that would need remapping to a more limited controller-friendly set with some kind of modifier/toggle system. And since we&#39;d

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So, my index is starting to have problems, and i&#39;m looking for a suitable steamvr replacement. I have a Quest 3 and a BSB, and from my comment history, i&#39;ve made it clear that I really don&#39;t like the bsb&#39;s lenses as a daily driver, though i can respect what it attempted to accomplish. The quest, on the other hand, is just a hassle for pcvr, though again, it&#39;s an extremely respectable piece of hardware. Would something like a Varjo Aero scratch the itch of PCVR hardware I want, or is there literally anything else comparable to the quality of the original index? (Build-wise, not resolution-wise, thing&#39;s 5 years old) I&#39;m looking for personal opinions on all PCVR HMDs, from the pimax crystal light to the VR1 if you&#39;re one of like 20 people that have one, so lay it on me.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/TheonetrueDEV1ATE"> /u/TheonetrueDEV1ATE </a> <br/> <span><a href="

And will it be unreliable like the VIVE?<br/> PIMAX Crystal - good price, but what about API exposure / access to raw data?</p> <p>I would like to hear thoughts from those who have experience with these or other headsets, especially for eye-tracking purposes!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Regular-Bicycle-5862"> /u/Regular-Bicycle-5862 </a> <br/> <
