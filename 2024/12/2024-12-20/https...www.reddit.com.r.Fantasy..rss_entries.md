I am looking to read books that involve creatively imagined, giant or powerful fantasy creatures similar to the beasts that feature in the Monster Hunter game series or the Drifting Dragons manga (it is about a dragon hunting crew). I have come across a lot of media that features alien fauna - the Raksura series (most of them were sentient races) and the excellent Scavenger Reigns (smaller creatures meant to be used by the protagonists), but I haven&#39;t really come across any literature that features a variety of giant and deadly alien animals. They don&#39;t even need to be a part of the actual story as long as they feature prominently in the background.</p> <p>I guess I want to read a story where the protagonists feel small in a world that is populated by interesting and dangerous beasts.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Street-Resist6438"> /u/Street-Res

They&#39;re all legitimate topics of discussion (within the bounds of Rule 1: Please Be Kind) but we&#39;ve had two weeks since <em>Wind &amp; Truth</em> came out to talk about them.

It has everything I&#39;d love about a fantasy show expect the magic. And the dragons.</p> <p>I hoped House of the Dragon S2 would be my pick for this year. My expectations were really high, especially with all the build-up in the 1st season to establish the power struggle between the Blacks and the Greens. The first 3 episodes were a bit slow, then came episode 4 &quot;The Red Dragon and the Gold,&quot; which was a blast from the past! A reminder of the good old days of Game of Thrones. I was like &quot;Here is where this show is gonna take off,&quot; but sadly, the rest of the season kept the trend of drag

## Fantasy set in a period like the 1950's/1960's?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>The main inspiration for this post was howl&#39;s moving castle alongside fear and hunger 2: Termina. Both are set in a post-industrial revolution age (Howl&#39;s moving castle is set in the nineteenth century, whilst Termina&#39;s story takes place after the game world&#39;s equivalent of the second world war. I reeeally suggest you check them out both to understand what I&#39;m trying to say!) I feel like there aren&#39;t enough works set in this period, which is sad since the genre is saturated with medieval fantasy that can get boring really quickly. Like, I wanna see unique takes on the 1950&#39;s from a fantastical perspective! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Thisbrodoesntcare"> /u/Thisbrodoesntcare </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1higmxb/fantasy_set_in_a_period_like_the_1950s1960s/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy

I even went so far as to ask a facebook group to help me find it because I couldn&#39;t remember the title. I was so excited to read it again. I am now nearly a quarter into this reread and everything about this story is genuinely leaving a bad taste in my mouth. I hate the character Sire Galan, and the writing rambles way too much with absolute made up nonesense to make it sound medieval. It is a big pile of nothing much in my opinion. The pacing is super slow and it lacks adventure/action with an added season of characters being terrible people. Firethorn isn&#39;t horrible but everyone around her sure is, and I will never understand why she loves Sire Galan. Ever. Now excuse me while I continue to hate this book haha! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/CordeliaJJ"> /u/CordeliaJJ </

Blurb for the book is at the bottom. </p> <p>The issue I&#39;m having is I cannot for the life of me come up with a good contemporary set of comp titles. I know it&#39;s important to say your book is like something published in the last ten years. My biggest influences in the genre are all older writers (China Meiville, Steven Erikson, Tad Williams). Every single book that I can think of which hits some of the same themes is at least a decade old. </p> <p>Speaking generally beyond what the blurb says, it&#39;s a setting with an 18th-century technology level which is pretty grounded, though with a major splash of New Weird as well. It&#39;s pretty heavy with political theming, which is part of why I chose an early modern (18th century-esque) setting.</p> <p>I don&#39;t intend this post to be pro

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all,</p> <p>I&#39;m a big collector and supporter of books and authors, but for reasons for space, and my own personal ease and comfort when reading, I much prefer mass market paperbacks over anything else.</p> <p>20 years ago everything came out in mass market eventually, and I would buy it new. But now it seems they stop at trade paperback.</p> <p>One example that I am thinking of right now is Tad Williams. I have all his books in mass market, specifically Osten Ard but Brother&#39;s of the Wind has been out for 3 to 4 years and only in trade. Into the NarrowDark is still trade only after 2 and some years. It would look horrible on my shelf to have 7 books as mass market, and then 3 as trade for the same series and world.</p> <p>I recall this happened with Brent Weeks and the lightbringer books where the first book or two was mass market and then the rest trades only.</p> <p>Does anyone know why this seems to be happening so much in the last 10

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>My favorite thing about Harry Potter is the feeling of wonder and mystery that Hogwarts induces. I love the setting of a vast, maze-like castle that can be cozy or dangerous, depending on the circumstances, and feels like a home where all of your friends live. I think this feeling is most prominent in the earlier books when the characters are younger and the stakes lower. I guess basically anything featuring a boarding school ripe for exploration and adventure and with a strong sense of home, friendship, comfort, etc. Preferably in a less modern setting. The only thing I have found that is sort of like this is Little Witch Academia. It can be anything: movies, games, books, manga, etc.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/bestgirlcoco"> /u/bestgirlcoco </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1hi8ml1/anything_to_make_me_feel_the_way_early_harry/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <spa

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>By Walter Wangerin</p> <p>I’ve had this book on my shelf literally for 40 (!) years but just never got around to reading it. It’s a beast fable (like Animal Farm or Watership Down) that draws its inspiration from medieval stories and Christian themes (but it neither proselytizes or makes explicit references to Christianity so don’t let that dissuade you). </p> <p>The story takes place in a world without humans where animals can talk and lands are ruled by roosters. An evil threatens one particular rooster (on the way to trying to destroy the world).</p> <p>I listened to the Audible version and I think the author’s drawing upon medieval texts really shines here as it felt like a work that really works when recited orally. It’s very easy to imagine this tale being told like one would hear the Canterbury Tales or Beowulf (but in modern English, of course). </p> <p>Strong recommend…great characters and story.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &
