In today's Daily Fix:
Jesse Eisenberg believes his career has suffered since starring in Zack Snyder's Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. The film introduced Eisenberg as the Snyderverse's Lex Luthor, but was met with tepid reviews. The follow-up, Justice League, fared even worse, and Eisenberg wasn't even aware of the negative response. But despite his claims, Eisenberg's career has continued, and his writing/directing/starring effort, A Real Pain, is getting some real Oscar buzz. In other news, Assassin's Creed Shadows features what the devs are calling the series' fastest assassin yet. In fact, Naoe may have a specific running animation when on rooftops, which is prompting speculation that the "Naruto run" could be featured in the game. And in other Ubisoft news, a new game was stealth-dropped, this one featuring Rayman. But don't get your hopes upâ€”it features NFTs.
