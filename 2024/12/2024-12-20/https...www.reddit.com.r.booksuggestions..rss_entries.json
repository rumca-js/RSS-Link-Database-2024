My mom has done some terrible things, like being physically abusive, stealing from family (including ruining my brother\u2019s credit, stealing tens of thousands from my dad and grandparents) and lying constantly. She will intentionally bring up horrifically sad things just to get a reaction from people. I could write a lot about the things she&#39;s done tbh lol but she\u2019s also not all bad, which makes me feel incredibly guilty for thinking negatively about her. It would be easier if she was a one dimensional evil mom, but she&#39;s not. </p> <p>Still, her behavior has left a mark on me, and I worry that I\u2019ve inherited some of her worst traits, which scares me.

I\u2019m looking for book recommendations that might make me fall in love with driving\u2014not to become a F1 race car driver or anything, but just for everyday driving. I\u2019m 24 years old and I\u2019ve had my learner\u2019s permit since I was 16. Over the years, I\u2019ve tried to learn to drive sporadically where I practice enough to develop the skills, but then I get too scared and stop for a few months before starting all over again.</p> <p>Now, I feel like I\u2019m at a standstill. Part of me thinks, \u201cI\u2019ve made it this far without needing to drive\u2026soooo\u2026\u2026I can probably keep going??\u201d But another part of me knows that in the future\u2014when I have a family, or another job\u2014I\u2019ll definitely want to know how to drive. I\u2019d also love to be able to take road trips on my own someday.</p> <p>I\u2019m hoping to find books that inspire me to love the idea of driving, to get past my fears, and to nurture a passion for it. If you have any recommendations, I\u2019d love to hear them! </p> <p>I\u2019m hones",

If you guys could help, I&#39;d really appreciate it!!!</p> <p>The types of books I enjoy are: *Romance (not hyper-smut, but don&#39;t mind a heated seen &amp; 1-2 smut scenes) *Mystery &amp; Drama (they go well together or separate) *Fantasy (my favorite) *Horror (mostly Stephen King) *Mythology (either actual myths or fiction based off myths)</p> <p>I prefer historical settings... Ancient Japan, Ireland, Europe, etc. I am also not a huge fan of the technology based future setting type stories. I like things that involve witchcraft/magic, vikings, elves, samurai, astrology, etc. </p> <p>What I currently have on my new TBR: *The Stars are Dying *When The Moon Hatched *The Wren In The Holly Library *The Disney Villains Seri",
