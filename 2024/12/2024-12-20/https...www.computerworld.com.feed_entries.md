<p>Automattic CEO Matt Mullenweg on Friday announced a shutdown of almost all services on WordPress.org, the open source project site that’s the home of the software, plugins, and the WordPress community, but was unclear on when the shutdown would end. </p>



<p>This move sharply increases the uncertainty surrounding WordPress, which is the software that runs roughly a third of the top 10,000 web sites by traffic, IDC said.</p>



<p>“My sense is that many enterprise WordPress administrators will think twice about continuing to use the software under these circumstances,” said IDC Research Manager Michele Rosen. “It’s such a shame to watch a leader in the open source community repeatedly sabotage

<p>Arm is waiting to see if it has won a battle over licensing of its microprocessor designs to Qualcomm that has cast doubt over the immediate future of some of the chip maker’s products.</p>



<p>The jury in the US District Court for the District of Delaware spent the week listening to arguments in the protracted and increasingly rancorous licensing dispute between Arm and Qualcomm and all that’s left is to hear their verdict.</p>



<p>The verdict, expected on Friday, could be hugely significant, not only for the parties involved but for the maze of other companies that have built their product development around their technology.</p>



<p>It’s an extraordinary clash between companies that un

<p>Apple has had a busy year in enterprise tech. Apple Intelligence, spatial computing, the war to protect the user experience against excessive regulation, security, privacy and continued improvements to Apple Silicon and valuable OS improvements for enterprise deployment have occupied much of its time. With this in mind, it’s a good time  to speak with Apple device management and security leaders from Jamf, Kandji, Jumpcloud, and Fleet to find out what mattered most in 2024, and what they expect in 2025.</p>

<p>Behind the responses from genAI models are testers who evaluate those answers for accuracy, but a report released this week casts doubt on the process.</p>



<p>According to a story published on Wednesday, contractors working on Google Gemini are now being directed to evaluate AI prompts and responses in areas in which they have no background, rather than being allowed to skip them as before.</p>



<p>This flies in the face of the “Building responsibly” section of the <a href="https://blog.google/technology/google-deepmind/google-gemini-ai-update-december-2024/#building-responsibly">Gemini 2.0 announcement</a>, which said, “As we develop these new technologies, we recognize the responsibility

<p>One key technique in the Windows repair playbook involves wiping out everything on the storage device (typically C:\) from which Windows boots and on which that OS resides. Prosaically enough, this device is often called the boot/system drive or disk.</p>



<p>After doing away with the existing disk layout and contents, one basically starts over with an entirely new disk layout and Windows installation into which nothing from a preceding install can carry over. Windows professionals call this a “clean install” because it wipes the disk before setting up a new disk layout, and installing a fresh, new copy of the Windows operating system and various other important supporting elements.</p>

<p>But when it comes to real-world productivity, Google’s actual operating system is really only half the story.</p>



<p>With Android in particular, lots of core OS-level elements exist as their own standalone apps — technically separate pieces of the puzzle that live in the Play Store and are updated numerous times a year in a way that reaches all of us at the same time. It’s a sharp contrast to the all-in-one strategy on the <em>other</em> side of the

<p>The initiative leverages state-of-the-art technologies like smart badges and military-grade mobile devices, designed to empower officers while ensuring accountability. These smart badges go beyond conventional body cameras, offering features such as continuous, tamper-proof video recording, GPS tracking, encrypted data handling,
