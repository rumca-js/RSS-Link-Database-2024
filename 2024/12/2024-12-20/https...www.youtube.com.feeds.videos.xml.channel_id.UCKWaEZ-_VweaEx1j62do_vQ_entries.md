Is pre-training a thing of the past? In Episode 34 of Mixture of Experts, host Tim Hwang is joined by Abraham Daniels, Vagner Santana and Volkmar Uhlig to debrief this week in AI. First, OpenAI cofounder Ilya Sutskever said that “peak data” was achieved, does this mean there is no longer a need to model pre-training? Next, IBM released Granite 3.1 with a slew of features, we cover them all. Then, there is a new way to steal AI models, how do we protect against model exfiltration. Finally, can NVIDIA Jetson for AI developers really increase hardware accessibility? Tune-in for more!
