Dating back to the Etruscan era and later used by Romans, the site was a place for votive offerings tied to healing rituals. The excavation also revealed preserved organic remains, such as eggs with intact yolks and plant matter, symbolising rebirth and regeneration",

        "description": "A study published in The Astrophysical Journal has shed light on how the Sun\u2019s magnetic field influences solar wind acceleration. Using data from the Parker Solar Probe and Solar Orbiter, researchers observed that sharp magnetic switchbacks smooth out into gentler waves as they travel further from the Sun. This relaxation process transfers magnetic energy into kinetic energy, speeding up solar wind particles. The findings, led by the University of Michigan team, offer critical insights for improving solar wind forecasts and understanding space weather impacts on Earth",

        "description": "NASA researchers have uncovered a black hole in the NGC 5084 galaxy that rotates at an unexpected angle, revealed through re-analysed Chandra X-ray data. The black hole is surrounded by unusual X-shaped plasma plumes, indicating disruptions in the galaxy's past. A tipped dusty disk further supports this, confirming the black hole's unique sideways orientation. These findings could reshape our understanding of black hole alignments in galaxies, with future studies focused on understanding the origin of this anomaly",
