I really don&#39;t have the money to spend on a proper VR headset, basically everything related to technology that is imported from overseas costs like 3 times the price where I live. I also mainly play games on PC and not on console.</p> <p>I&#39;m just curious if its worth getting an old VR headset like a PSVR1, they don&#39;t go for much around here, or if I should get like a proper secondhand sim-free phone, with a gyroscope and put it in one of those VR gear headsets. I saw that through some applications you are able to use it with steamVR, but I&#39;m not sure how viable that is. I don&#39;t plan on using any VR controllers, mainly just the flight stick or joystick for flight simulations. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/These-Carry4807\"> /u/These-Carry4807 </a> <br/> <span><a href",

So if you are a fan of the series I can easily recommend it you. The game definitely has some odd mechanics which holds it back from becoming 10/10. For example when aiming down sights, your pulse rifle or shotgun will automatically lock on your shoulder, which feels really unnatural. It\u2019s a shame cause the weapon models look AAA high quality and faithful to the source material. </p> <p>Thankfully, you won\u2019t be aiming down sights much, as most of the shooting is done up close and from your hip. And shooting from your hip feels great, as you have full control of your weapon and the adaptive triggers, controller rumble is ",

I am 16 years old and have had a quest 2 for around 2 years now and just started playing it again a couple months ago after I had not been playing it for around a year or so (if that makes sense). Anyways, my parents are scared that it can cause cancer and other harmful things to my eyes, my brain, and give me tumors. I play Beat Saber most out of all of the games and I play for around 20 minutes a week. My mom says that it is very much and that I shouldn\u2019t play for that long since it is extremely bad for me without having any evidence to prove it. She says that there is not enough research that has been done to VR in general and that people in 10 years will see that it will be as harmful as smoking is. She thinks that it will be the same as the situation where nobody thought smoking was bad for you, until they found out. She also does not like that it is so close to my face. Is there any way I can prove to her that I won\u2019t die from playing",

However, I recently did a massive overhaul of mu computer, I replaced the 2060 with a 4070TI super, replaced my old Ryzen 5 with a new Ryzen 7 and sone other upgrades including a new power supply that can handle more than what&#39;s currently installed. </p> <p>I hooked up and set up my old Oculus Rift and the performance is ABYSMAL, it can barely run anything, the lag is nauseating and even the most basic programs in VR which could be handled with ease before now cause my computer to go into meltdown and the VR crashes. With non-VR games the PC&#39;s upgrades all work perfectly and gaming is silky smooth, but with VR it&#39;s terrible. </p> <p>Can anyone tell me what could be causing this and if there are any fixes? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www",

Not just a spectator mode - a fully playable alternate state that lets you keep gaming when your body needs a break.</p> <p><strong>Technical Reality</strong></p> <p>The implementation is surprisingly straightforward - most VR games already have third-person camera systems and full-body avatars for things like multiplayer or recording footage.

Recently ALVR started stuttering heavily - freezes up to 10s (rare) when in areas with lots of people (looks like spec issue, but again, it only started recently and this doesn&#39;t happen every time), it&#39;s mainly noticeable when viewing desktop and trying to do something, the view can freeze for up to 30s.<br/> One thing I believe also started when the performance decreased, is that the SteamVR overlay started being very shaky, even when slightly moving my head. I wonder if perhaps it was caused by one of the updates, and if there&#39;s people with similar experience?

But it is not Quest1 age already. the compression artifacts had been reduce A LOT thanks to new codec and hardwares. the only advantage left for cable over wireless on paper will be latency, not image qc.</p> <",
