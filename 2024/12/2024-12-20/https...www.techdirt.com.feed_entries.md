It often seems that when people have no good ideas or, indeed, any ideas at all, the next thing out of their mouths is &#8220;maybe some AI?&#8221; It&#8217;s not that AI can&#8217;t be useful. It&#8217;s that so many use cases are less than ideal. Enter Axon, formerly Taser, which has moved from selling modified cattle [&#8230;]

We&#8217;ve been warning for years that the UK&#8217;s Online Safety Act would be a disaster for the open internet. Its supporters accused us of exaggerating, or &#8220;shilling&#8221; for Big Tech. But as we&#8217;ve long argued, while tech giants like Facebook and Google might be able to shoulder the law&#8217;s immense regulatory burdens, smaller sites would [&#8230;]
