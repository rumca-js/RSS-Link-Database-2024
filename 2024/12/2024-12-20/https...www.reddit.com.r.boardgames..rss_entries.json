Also if there are any good northern hemisphere board game cruises that would be amazing too. I&#39;d like somewhere I can get by by speaking English. I mainly enjoy euro&#39;s and also learning light, fun games on the day.</p> <p>The main ones I&#39;ve heard of are Spiel Essen (October, Germany), Gen Con (July/August, US) and UK Games Expo (May/June, UK).</p> <p>The only convention I&#39;ve been to is Wellycon, here in Wellington, New Zealand.</p> <p>Any he",

The app doesn\u2019t let me add a session unless it\u2019s from the games listed in my collection in BGG synced with the app. In the past, I could do this without any issues, but recently I played a few sessions of a game from a friend\u2019s collection, and it won\u2019t let me log it because that game isn\u2019t in my app collection.

I&#39;ve never met anyone outside my family that knows what I&#39;m talking about when I bring it up and there is really not a whole lot in relation to it online. Wondering if anyone else enjoyed this game XD or I mean......

Any very simple ones that are fun? For context, we tried Zoo Vadis and that was too much for him to handle. Grateful for any recs you could provide!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/emunchkinman\"> /u/emunchkinman </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1hi8pjm/simple_board_game_for_my_dad/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1hi8pjm/simple_board_game_for_my_dad/\">[comments]</a></span>",
