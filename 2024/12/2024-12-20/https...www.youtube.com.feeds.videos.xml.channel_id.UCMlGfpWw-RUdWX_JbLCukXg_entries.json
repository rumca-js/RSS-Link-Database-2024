Even for simple use cases, you can easily get: \n- Unexpected functional behavior \n- Surprising compile-time errors with cryptic error messages \n- Fatal runtime errors (without even noticing them)\n\nThere are reasons for the design of the filter view. For a successful filtering of elements you should know and understand the design and all of its consequences.\n\nThe talk will demonstrate all the issues with simple real-work examples and explain both th",
