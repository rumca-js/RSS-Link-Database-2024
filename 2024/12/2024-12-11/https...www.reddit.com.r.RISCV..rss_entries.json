So it is basically a standartised set of instructions (and bit encoding of those instructions), with a standartised additional instructions sets (like atomics), which allows for code compiled once as RISC-V instructions to run on all machines implementing RISC-V (and apropriate extensions), with backward compatibility. </p> <p>Most effort is going towards developing ISA for CPUs. GPUs are similar to CPUs in many ways, and there could be ISA extensions for GPU instructions. But I did not find almost any information about GPUs running on RISC-V instructions beeing developed. Why? Is it planned but not started yet to develop, or are there deeper challenges with it? </p> <p>I am asking because it seems that standartisation of GPUs ISA has the same benefits as for CPUs. Maybe it has major drawbacks which RISC-V ISA for CPUs don&#39;t have",
