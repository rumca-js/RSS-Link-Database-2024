Microsoft is expanding its suite of cloud gaming features by introducing the ability for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers to stream a "select" number of their owned games to Xbox Series X/S or Xbox One consoles, without needing to install them first. It's available to Xbox Insiders now, and will launch for all users at a later date.

It's a truth you need to understand before you play the game in order to get the most out of it, and to accept it, if you like. Like the Souls series, this is a game about relishing the challenge and overcoming seemingly impossible odds to move forwards. Through perseverance and trial and error, you will succeed, and you will feel all the more incredible for it.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/path-of-exile-2-early-access-review">Read more</a></p>

## Skydance's Behemoth review - a grand and gory VR hack 'n' slash that fails to deliver on its lofty promises

<img src="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/behemoth-review.jpg?width=1920&height=1920&fit=bounds&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp" /> <p>I thought we'd all decided during the Xbox 360 days that checkpoints just before boss fights that kicked off with reams of unskippable dialogue were very annoying indeed. No one in their right mind wants to hear the same voice lines repeated over and over again each time you restart a fight, especially fights that are as tough as those in Behemoth. But I guess developer Skydance wasn&rsquo;t paying attention during that era because this game features some of the worst checkpointing I've experienced in a long time.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/skydances-behemoth-review">Read more</a></p>

## Beelink SER9 review: AMD's Strix Point is its most powerful PC APU to date - but how does it game?

<img src="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/STRIX-site.jpg?width=1920&height=1920&fit=bounds&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp" /> <p>It's fair to say that AMD is now leading the mobile x86 processor market, with its APUs particularly potent in powering the Steam Deck, ROG Ally and other PC handhelds. Following on from the Z1 Extreme and similar 7840U/8840U processors, there are two next-gen series: the upcoming Z2 lineup and the currently-available Strix Point AI SoCs. We're looking at the latter today - and it's the top-spec Ryzen AI 9 HX 370. </p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-beelink-ser9-review-amds-most-powerful-mobile-chip-yet">Read more</a></p>
