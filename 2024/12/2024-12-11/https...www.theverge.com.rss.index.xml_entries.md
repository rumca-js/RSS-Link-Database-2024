  <p id="wlNlq4">While the best iPad deals usually land during major sale events like Black Friday and Amazon Prime Day, many great iPad deals are attainable outside those times. The day-to-day discounts may come and go like changing winds, but there’s often something to be saved, particularly on the more affordable iPads. The most recent <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/7/24146276/apple-ipad-pro-oled-features-specs-let-loose-event">iPad Pro and iPad Air</a> are also starting to see substantial price reductions, and now that Apple has a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/22/24275956/apple-ipad-mini

  <p id="RDCudC">Sonos will soon encourage employees on its various product teams who live near its US office locations to come in for at least two days per week, <em>The Verge</em> has learned. That’s a notable break from the company’s history, throughout which Sonos has enthusiastically supported fully remote and hybrid work. Job listings at Sonos routinely state that “it’s about impact, not location.” <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Benefits/Sonos-Work-From-Home-US-BNFT152_E259049_N1.htm">Glassdoor reviews</a> have long backed this up, with employees reporting no pressure to come into the office.</p>
