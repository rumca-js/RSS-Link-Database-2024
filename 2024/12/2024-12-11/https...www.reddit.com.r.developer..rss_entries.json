The setup involves around 10 locations, with each site having approximately 10-15 devices connected to a switch. The network uses three VLANs, with devices assigned dynamic IPs via DHCP. We only have access to the back-office computer at each site, so we can\u2019t configure the internet equipment like firewalls, switches, or modems.</p> <p>The software needs to allow manual input of IP addresses, especially for devices on VLANs that may not support automatic discovery. A time-stamped alert system when a device goes offline is crucial. Simplicity is key\u2014fancy features and extensive integrations aren\u2019t necessary.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/andrewderjack\"> /u/andrewderjack </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1hbvaao/seeking_recommendations_for_easytouse_ping/\">[link]",
