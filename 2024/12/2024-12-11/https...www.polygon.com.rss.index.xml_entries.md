<p class="has-text-align-none">2024 saw politics, culture, and the overlap between them grow ever stranger, and that’s reflected in our picks for the year’s top video essays. Videos about artificial intelligence, abuses of authority, mass hysteria, weird corporate trends (and weirder corporate collapses) fill out these ranks. Lest that make this year’s list sound like too much of a downer, know that most of these works are also supremely fun. It has now been six years <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/12/28/18156334/best-youtube-video-essays-2018-watch">since I first did a piece like this for Polygon</a>.

<p class="has-text-align-none">Over the past 10 years, The Game Awards has become the go-to awards show for recognizing the best of the best video games, thanks to its splashy presentation, celebrity appearances, and exclusive reveals secured by the show’s host and creator, Geoff Keighley. The Game Awards is also known for its actual awards, though they often take a backseat to the spectacle.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We now live in a world where documentary filmmaking is constant. Through TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, and YouTube, many of us are fed a near-ceaseless stream of moving images drawn from the everyday, in the form of memes, skits, jokes, rants, in-depth critical analyses, and “look at this cool thing” slices of life. The downside of this is that we also live in a world where it’s getting harder and harder to trust what we see, because we don’t always know who’s behind those images, or why they were posted. Is that footage of a riot happening right now at some campus protest, or is it
