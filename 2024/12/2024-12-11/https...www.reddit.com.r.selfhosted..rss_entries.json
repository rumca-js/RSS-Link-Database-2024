I want to set up paperless-ngx to finally get rid of all the paper receipts. I would need five paperless-ngx instances for this. My idea was as follows: I rent a server in the Hetzner Cloud and install Proxmox there. Then I create five containers, in each of which I install paperless-ngx. I would also like to use wireguard to protect access in the best possible way. So far, that&#39;s not a problem for me.</p> <p>What I&#39;m wondering: Can I restrict access to individual containers with wireguard and this setup? For example, user A can only access container 1, but not 2, 3, 4 and 5, etc. - Is there any way to control this? Or do I need a separate IP and a separate Wireguard instance for each container? If there are tutorials or similar somewhere, I would like to read up and try it out. Many thanks for any help.</p> <p>Greetings, Christian</p> </div><!-- SC_",
