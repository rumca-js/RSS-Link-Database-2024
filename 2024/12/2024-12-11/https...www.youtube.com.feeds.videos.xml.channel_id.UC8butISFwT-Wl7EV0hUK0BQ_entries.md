Learn about Elasticsearch with this comprehensive course designed for beginners, featuring both theoretical concepts and hands-on applications using Python (though applicable to any programming language). The course is structured in two parts: first covering essential Elasticsearch fundamentals including index management, document storage, text analysis, pipeline creation, search functionality, and advanced features like semantic search and embeddings; followed by a practical section where you'll build a real-world website using Elasticsearch as a search engine, working with the Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) dataset to implement features such as data cleaning pipelines, tokenization, pagination, and aggregations.
