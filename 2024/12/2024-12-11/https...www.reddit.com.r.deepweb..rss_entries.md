<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am interested in such a question. Although I have been on the darknet for quite a long time, but with the tightening of the legislation of my country, now I want to go there almost completely. But I often come across the fact that there are no analogues in the darknet of something similar to extensive forums or social networks, mostly I see a split space like the old Internet. Even if it has charm and nostalgia. And those numerous forums that I found were mostly thematic and not so free. So - does anyone know some interesting spaces in the darknet and deepweb where one could safely move for reasons of anonymity and for recreation?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/DueShell307"> /u/DueShell307 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/deepweb/comments/1hc4fuo/forums/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/deepweb/comments/1hc4fuo/forums/">[comments]</a></span>
