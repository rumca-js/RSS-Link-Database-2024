There was an actual board that you&#39;d move player tokens that were shaped like paper doll chains to keep score. The tokens were brightly colored but would all interlock at the bottom to make a chain standing up.</p> <p>The game involved a series of cards, half with one word on it and the other half with images. The images were basically just stock photos of generic things. Such as an ashtray with a lit cigarette, a rose, an illustration of the devil, a stationary set, a traffic jam, etc. Then the word cards were just like one word that one person would play and you&#39;d match an image to the word. The person whose turn it was would pick the image they liked best and they would win the round just like apples to",

It doesn&#39;t have to be super easy as we&#39;ll usually have someone play on a team with them and they can be adventurous when they&#39;re not tired lol</p> <p>My criteria is a game not exteemely complicated, is unique, and not extremely expensive.

On your turn you could move one space in any direction (up or each cardinal direction) or you could decend as many spaces as you want.
