Stunning new photographs by a team of astronomers have revealed a newly forming galaxy that looks remarkably similar to a young Milky Way. The extraordinary images give us an unprecedented picture of what our own galaxy might have looked like when it was being born.

## AI thought knee X-rays show if you drink beer -- they don't

A new study highlights a hidden challenge of using AI in medical imaging research -- the phenomenon of highly accurate yet potentially misleading results known as 'shortcut learning.' The researchers analyzed thousands of knee X-rays and found that AI models can 'predict' unrelated and implausible traits such as whether patients abstained from eating refried beans or beer. While these predictions have no medical basis, the models achieved high levels of accuracy by exploiting subtle and unintended patterns in the data.

## You are what you eat...and so are your grandkids? Study links poor diet to multi-generational health issues

Is it possible to pass on the effects of malnutrition? A new animal study found that a protein-deficient diet in one generation created related health risks -- lower birth-weight, smaller kidneys -- in offspring that lasted four generations.

## The maternal microbiome during pregnancy impacts offspring's stem cells in mice

Gut microbiome composition during pregnancy has long-term effects on offspring stem cell growth and development, researchers report. Treating pregnant mice with a common gut microbe resulted in offspring that had more active stem cells in both the brain and intestinal tract. As a result, the offspring were less anxious and recovered quicker from colitis, and these differences were still evident at 10 months of age.

## New insights about how 'bad' cholesterol works in the body

Scientists have made a significant breakthrough in understanding how 'bad' cholesterol, known as low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol or LDL-C, builds up in the body. The researchers were able to show for the first time how the main structural protein of LDL binds to its receptor -- a process that starts the clearing of LDL from the blood -- and what happens when that process gets impaired.

## Mapping the nanoscale architecture of functional materials

Researchers have pioneered a new technique called X-ray linear dichroic orientation tomography, which probes the orientation of a material's building blocks at the nanoscale in three-dimensions. First applied to study a polycrystalline catalyst, the technique allows the visualization of crystal grains, grain boundaries and defects -- key factors determining catalyst performance. Beyond catalysis, the technique allows previously inaccessible insights into the structure of diverse functional materials, including those used in information technology, energy storage and biomedical applications.

The black box of the human brain is starting to open. Although animal models are instrumental in shaping our understanding of the mammalian brain, scarce human data is uncovering important specificities. Neurosurgeons nowshed light on the human hippocampal CA3 region, central for memory storage.

## Researchers discover new third class of magnetism that could transform digital devices

A new class of magnetism called altermagnetism has been imaged for the first time in a new study. The findings could lead to the development of new magnetic memory devices with the potential to increase operation speeds of up to a thousand times.

## Personalized blood count could lead to early intervention for common diseases

A complete blood count (CBC) screening is a routine exam requested by most physicians for healthy adults. Currently, the results of CBC tests are analyzed using a one-size-fits-all reference interval, but a new study suggests that this approach can lead to overlooked deviations in health. In a retrospective analysis, researchers show that these reference intervals, or setpoints, are unique to each patient. The study revealed that one healthy patient's CBC setpoints can be distinguishable from 98 percent of other healthy adults.

Scientists' findings in mice could translate into a radical, needle-free vaccination approach that would also eliminate reactions including fever, swelling and pain.

## Biological diversity is not just the result of genes

How can we explain the morphological diversity of living organisms? Although genetics is the answer that typically springs to mind, it is not the only explanation. By combining observations of embryonic development, advanced microscopy, and cutting-edge computer modelling, a multi-disciplinary team demonstrates that the crocodile head scales emerge from the mechanics of growing tissues, rather than molecular genetics. The diversity of these head scales observed in different crocodilian species therefore arises from the evolution of mechanical parameters, such as the growth rate and stiffness of the skin. These results shed new light on the physical forces involved in the development and evolution of living forms.

## Analysis reveals an additional mechanism behind statin therapy's heart-related benefits in people with HIV

Investigators who previously found that a daily statin pill helps prevent heart attacks and strokes in people with HIV have now discovered a potential mechanism that may help to stabilize plaques and prevent their rupture in blood vessels.
