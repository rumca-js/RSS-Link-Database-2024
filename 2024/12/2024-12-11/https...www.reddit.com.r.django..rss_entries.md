<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have been working with Django and python and have made a few projects. I made a finance tracker that can store expenses and income and show the monthly and total savings. The way it works is a user enters their monthly income on one page. That income is saved and then they can go to an expense page and enter an expense, a title for the said expense and if the expense is “recurring” by checking a box. If they check that box they then have to click a calendar and select when the expense should be deducted. The expense should then be run into the formula the expense is deducted from the entered income. But I’m having some issues getting a few things to work. </p> <p>The expenses when entered normally work and the monthly and total savings is being displayed correctly. The trouble I’m having is making the “recurring expenses” work. Even when I check the box and set the date it shows up in the table as recurring expense? No. It should show yes, The date
