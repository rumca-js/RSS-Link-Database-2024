Google is currently testing AI that it says can process the information on screen in real-time and offer advice to players about how to proceed.</p><p>Google revealed this information while touting <a href="https://blog.google/technology/google-deepmind/google-gemini-ai-update-december-2024/">the benefits of its Gemini 2.0 AI model</a>. AI agents created by Gemini 2.0 are using Supercell games like Clash of Clans and Hay Day to test the technology's ability to learn and decipher the "rules and challenges across a diverse range of games."

<p>Though Metaphor: ReFantazio is the former Persona team's first foray into high fantasy, it might also be the most grounded and deeply human game they've ever created. By weaving magical elements with universal topics--such as prejudice, poverty, grief, cycles of violence, anxiety, and the role religion and politics can play in both oppressing and empowering the people--Metaphor is able to examine humanity with some distance and through a unique lens. It poses countless questions to its players, all while admitting the answers might not be simple or absolute. And yet, it places special emphasis on one question in particular: Does fiction have the power to shape our world?</p><p dir="ltr">By the time the game comes to a close, the answer is a resounding yes. Metaphor: ReFantazio is a beautiful exploration into how fantasy is a vessel for ideas and humanity even in the darkest of times. It understands the impact that art and the ideas transferred through it have on society, and asks

<p dir="ltr">Even a decade after its release, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/alien-isolation/">Alien: Isolation</a> remains a standout experience.</p><p dir="ltr">It's a monumental example of adaptation in video games, thanks to the fact that developer Creative Assembly was packed with fans of Ridley Scott's 1979 film, Alien, and an incredibly tight, detailed focus on the fidelity of the movie's setting. It also set a bar in horror game design, with the alien operating on a set of reactive artificial intelligence rules that made it terrifyingly unpredictable and unstoppably lethal.</p><p dir="ltr">It also stands apart from other games based on the Alien franchise, which tend to ignore Scott's original film in favor of iterations on Aliens, James Cameron's sequel, which moves away from straight horror to feature more action--and a bunch of well-outfitted, smack-talking Marines. Creative Assembly instead pitched an <em>Alien</em> game, not an <em>Aliens</em> game, one that wou

<p>At long last, it's time to take down Diablo in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-immortal/">Diablo Immortal</a>. The story threads of Blizzard's mobile ARPG have been building to this moment since the game's launch in 2022, and it all will culminate not only in the game's largest new zone to date, but also its biggest boss battle yet--against none other than the Lord of Terror himself.</p><p dir="ltr">Yes, Diablo is finally at full strength in the Shattered Sanctuary update, and it will be up to players, armed with the angelic blade El'druin, to put an end to his world-altering efforts. To the far north of Sanctuary at World's Crown, Diablo has unleashed the power of the Worldstone Shard in his possession and started Sanctuary's unmaking. After battling Diablo's armies through an increasingly surreal hellscape, players will confront "Big Red" himself for the first time since the end of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iii/">Diablo 3's</a> story 12 years

<p dir="ltr">One of US President-elect Donald Trump's biggest talking points this election season has been around the subject of tariffs. Specifically, Trump has discussed tariff rates of 60% or more on products imported from China. Considering China is where video game consoles, accessories, and other video game and technology products are produced (at least in part--but these days, to a lesser degree), many are wondering how these proposed tariffs could impact the consumer.</p><p dir="ltr">In short, people want to know if video game consoles and games are about to get significantly more expensive, as some have predicted. This issue is even more top of mind considering the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/">Switch 2</a> is expected to launch in 2025, with Rockstar's massively anticipated <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/">Grand Theft Auto VI</a> also lined up

<p>GameScience has <a href="https://www.heishenhua.com/news/detail?id=149">released a new patch</a> for Black Myth: Wukong and it's a rather hefty one, featuring two challenge modes and loads of new equipment. There are some quality-of-life changes too.</p><p>The two challenge modes can be accessed after beating the game at least once. At any save point, called Keeper's Shrine, the player can find the "Return of Rivals" and "Gauntlet of Legends." The former lets players challenge any former opponents at three levels of varying difficulty.</p><p>The latter challenge mode lets players fight against multiple enemies in successions, with customized curses impacting the difficulty. Some old enemies will also have new moves. Completing the gauntlet will provide rewards such as new equipment, weapons, drinks, and medicine. In both modes, however, if any opponents haven't been defeated in the campaign, then they can't be challenged until doing so.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/article

<p>Actor Rob Wiethoff famously portrayed John Marston in Rockstar's acclaimed 2010 Red Dead Redemption, and now he's starting a new project that is completely different and unexpected. Wiethoff, 48, has launched an OnlyFans, but it's not <em>that kind </em>of OnlyFans. After fans discovered he had an OnlyFans set up, Wietoff released a video responding to what he described as "panic" surrounding this.</p><p>"I have an OnlyFans page. I do," Wietoff told his 200,000 followers on Instagram in a video address. It costs $5/month to subscribe. Wiethoff's OnlyFans account will be focused on his own personal health journey as he looks to get lean and ripped.</p><p>"There will be nothing but me trying to get in shape. If you want to be part of that, you are welcome to join," he said. "I know what OnlyFans is. Not everything on there has to be that kind of content. That is not what my content is going to be. If you want to get ripped with an old-timer, sign up; that's it."</p><a href="https://
