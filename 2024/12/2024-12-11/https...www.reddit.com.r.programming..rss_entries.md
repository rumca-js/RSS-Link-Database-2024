<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello hello people, im a second year cs student and i have been feeling hopeless, every bit of studying this major is hard. I want to start complex projects like (basic OS, compiler, web servers) so I become better. The problem is I don&#39;t want to rely on ai to code it, but it is hard and feel like the classic imposter syndrome. When I start a project, I have no idea where to start and most of the time AI is helping lots. Which I dislike. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Either-Control-3343"> /u/Either-Control-3343 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://github.com/alexandru356">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1hbhx4r/complex_projects_and_imposter_syndrome/">[comments]</a></span>
