So whenever this pops up, if I put the original password, it says it&#39;s incorrect? I tried contacting Asus and they said the RMA would be the laptops worth since they&#39;re gonna have to replace the laptop and it was out of warranty. After a while of research, I saw that a bootable disk of Linux could override the bios password prompt and I was just wondering how to do that.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m hoping to completely switch to Linux on my gaming PC, but there&#39;s one major issue remaining that&#39;s preventing me from switching. I have a 165hz monitor with VRR, an Nvidia GPU, and am running Bazzite with KDE as my desktop environment. Whenever I&#39;m playing a game that runs at less than half of whatever I set my refresh rate to, the game starts having really bad, erratic frametimes. Turning on the FPS display on my monitor, the refresh rate is constantly going all over the place; If I&#39;m playing a game capped at 60 FPS, the refresh rate keeps jumping between 60, 120, and 165 Hz, when it should be staying at 120 Hz with LFC. </p> <p>I&#39;m assuming this is something that I can&#39;t fix on my own, I need to wait for whatever&#39;s causing this to be addressed from somewhere upstream. But is this an Nvidia driver issue, a KWin issue, or something else? Where do I report this so it goes to the correct people? </p> <p>More detailed

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello guys, this is my story. I and my brother used to co-op together on our 10 years old laptops. PC gaming was never a thing then. Now, i&#39; m able to afford a real one but my brother still stuck with his laptop. Hence, i want to somehow sharing my computer to him so we can co-op with better game. This is my PC hardware:</p> <ul> <li>CPU: Intel 13400f</li> <li>GPU: RTX 4060</li> <li>16 GB of RAM</li> <li>1TB SSD</li> </ul> <p>I am not familiar with virtualize on Linux and the splitting of GPU. I heard that NVIDIA prevent user to sharing their GPU to others. I want to make an instance so my brother can remote to it as his gaming PC. How can i achieve this ? Thank for your helps.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Classic_Membership82"> /u/Classic_Membership82 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1hbwvb7/how_to_sharing_computer_hardware_for_other_user/">[link]</

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So i just got Marvel Rivals to work on linux by using proton, which made me wonder if a game company would ban people for intentionally circumventing the platform limitations of their game?<br/> After all, Marvel Rivals isn&#39;t supposed to work under linux, its just that steam allows you to play it on linux, the game also features an anti-cheat that might not work properly under proton. So how likely would it be for NetEase to start banning people using linux?</p> <p>Sorry if this is a stupid question, I&#39;m new to linux and linux gaming in general, so this is just a genuine question i had.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/jordiwd"> /u/jordiwd </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1hbvx1g/question_about_the_legality_of_running_games/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1hbvx1g/question_about_the_legality_of_r

The music in the game works great and the effects (blasters, lightsabers, etc.) sound normal, but I can only hear the dialog&#39;s processing effects (i.e. reverb and echo) themselves without the initial dry signal. This makes it very hard to hear anything they&#39;re saying. I tried it on Windows with the very same hardware and it works well over there. I tried using my PC&#39;s internal sound card with proton and it works as expected there (besides the audio quality being shit). I only know the basics about linux audio, tbh, so I&#39;m kinda lost here.</p> <p>I&#39;m on Manjaro Linux with pipewire+wireplumber (but I tried pipewire-session-manager as well). The audio interface is a MAUDIO Fast Track Ultra 8R. I tried various proton versions (what I had installed, i.e. Proton GE 9.20, Proton Exp

## Best way to run Steam games without updating them?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Cyberpunk 2077 got an update today that adds some new features, however it also breaks basically every mod right now. You can roll back to the old branch or disable auto-updating (I did both), but they&#39;ll be removing the old version in January.</p> <p>So, on Windows, you would just disable auto-updating and run the game straight from the .exe. Not sure what the best way to do this would be however on Linux. </p> <p>Manually move it into something like Lutris or Bottles and crack the game files to remove the DRM? Add the .exe as a non-steam game? Neither are preferable because I&#39;d like to keep playtime and achievements. Is there a command of some sort that would force the game to run anyway? I know of steam steam://rungameid/, but I&#39;m not sure if that works with a game that has an update pending.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/KimKat98"> /u/KimKat98 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://w
