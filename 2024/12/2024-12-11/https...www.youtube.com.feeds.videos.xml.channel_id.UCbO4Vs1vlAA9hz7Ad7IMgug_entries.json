This series focuses on games you may have never even heard of and gives us an inside look at the wider world of independantly published Tabletop Wargames of all genres!\n\nIn this inaugural episode we're going to lay out the format - One game suggested by Patrons and one game I think needs more HYPE. Longtime Patron Jez Hunt threw out 2024's Devilry Afoot for our first looks and #28MAG's LOBSTERPOT for a game I think deserves more Hype!\n\nCheck out Devilry Afoot HERE: https://www.wargamevault.com/product/488909/Devilry-Afoot?affiliate_id=210041\n\nCheck out Lobsterpot for FREE HERE: https://28-mag.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/68bed-lobsterpot-v4.pdf",
