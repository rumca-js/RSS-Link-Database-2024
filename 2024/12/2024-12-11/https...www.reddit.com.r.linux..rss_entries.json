So whenever this pops up, if I put the original password, it says it&#39;s incorrect? I tried contacting Asus and they said the RMA would be the laptops worth since they&#39;re gonna have to replace the laptop and it was out of warranty. After a while of research, I saw that a bootable disk of Linux could override the bios password prompt and I was just wondering how to do that. I really appreciate you guys! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/nirmaul\"> /u/nirmaul </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://i.redd.it/k3rqql8s8a6e1.jpeg\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1hc3rxz/bypass_bios_password/\">[comments]</a></span>",
