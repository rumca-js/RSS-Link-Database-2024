Maybe it&#39;s the huge experience, but I can&#39;t put it in the same category for some reason. I still love the game but perhaps the size of the game is too much or something. What about y&#39;all?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>EDIT - SOLVED </p> <p>Hello! I’ve recently started to play Mario 64 again after years off of it. When I’m in the Dire, Dire Docks course, the Bowser Sub is still afloat when trying to complete other stars. Mostly it isn’t a problem, however I can’t do the coins as there are no poles. I’ve tried resetting the game, and I’ve taken it out and give the cartridge a clean hoping this would help but still the same result. I was hoping someone could help me without having to start the game again Thank you 🫶🏻</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Lower_Sleep2823"> /u/Lower_Sleep2823 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1hbqnw7/mario_64/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1hbqnw7/mario_64/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all,</p> <p>I&#39;ve been asked to take over my long running family Christmas quiz, and one of the rounds I have planned is a retro video game round using the Retroid Pocket 3 Plus. Essentially, I&#39;d like four single player games that can easily be set up for a challenge scenario, lasting between a minute and two minutes, with a definite score at the end.</p> <p>So far my first choice is a time trial of a track from Micro Machines V3 on the PS1, for some reason I&#39;m struggling to come up with many other viable options!</p> <p>I&#39;m fine with using save states to get to an immediate starting position, so the games don&#39;t have to be inherently score-based from the start.</p> <p>I&#39;d love to get some input from the community!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/tomthedude93"> /u/tomthedude93 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1hbq4l8/running_a_quiz_a
