It&#39;s glitchy, unreliable, and often gives default responses about Meta even when that&#39;s not what you ask it. It can&#39;t hold conversations because it often forgets the last message you sent, even if it was seconds ago, but the worst and most frustrating part is that rather than giving you information like the last Meta AI, it will straight up give you an entirely made up word salad response, which it will admit when asked it knew wasn&#39;t true, it just gave a made up response.

Basically what I\u2019m thinking is a subscription based site that will guide you through your particular process and fill out custom forms for you based on your input and needs. It would have to be able to read documents and extract information like google LM and also act as an agent to fill the custom made pdf forms. My ai journey is very young and I\u2019m wondering if I can get even a little guidance on direction.

However, there are of course those who believe that AI will go rogue and be the death of us like we&#39;ve seen in all those movies. And I find myself not having that fear myself due to what I feel is a simple notion, and that is...just unplug it. I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s a way for an AI to get itself into and control any sort of power source that has a way in digitally, but as long as there&#39;s some sort of analog power source that it can&#39;t get to, you can just turn it off, right? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Tiger_Shark42\"> /u/Tiger_Shark42 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1hbhffm/a_burning_question/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1hbhffm/a_burning_question/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Specifically, I need a system where I can upload multiple documents\u2014such as company policies, roadmaps, KPIs, and other relevant materials\u2014and then use those documents as a foundation to discuss and generate new policies, strategies, and roadmaps for future group activities.</p> <p>The concept isn\u2019t limited to just these examples. I\u2019d like to explore how such a system can be applied to other areas as well, but it\u2019s critical that the AI takes the uploaded documents into account when making inferences and generating ideas.</p> <p>So far, I\u2019ve used free versions of ChatGPT, Claude, and Copilot. They\u2019re decent but not quite what I\u2019m looking for. I\u2019ve also briefly tried Google\u2019s NotebookLM, which seems closer to what I need, at least conceptually.</p> <p>I\u2019m open to paid options and would really appreciate any recommendations for tools or services that excel in",
