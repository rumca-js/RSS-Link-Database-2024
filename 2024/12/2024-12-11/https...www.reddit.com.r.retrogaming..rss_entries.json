Essentially, I&#39;d like four single player games that can easily be set up for a challenge scenario, lasting between a minute and two minutes, with a definite score at the end.</p> <p>So far my first choice is a time trial of a track from Micro Machines V3 on the PS1, for some reason I&#39;m struggling to come up with many other viable options!</p> <p>I&#39;m fine with using save states to get to an immediate starting position, so the games don&#39;t have to be inherently score-based from the start.</p> <p>I&#39;d love to get some input from the community!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/tomthedude93\"> /u/tomthedude93 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1hbq4l8/running_a_quiz_a",
