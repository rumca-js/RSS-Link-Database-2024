<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Newsdemon are charging me a monthly fee of A$18, so naturally I want to cancel/close that account. However, I’ve forgotten the password. Tried using the forgotten password link 3 or 4 times now, at least, emailed their support too. </p> <p>Nothing from them. If they responded and I was able to gain access then maybe I’d consider rejoining at their next offer. But right now I have to cancel the card they use to charge me, causing me the slight annoyance of having to change the payment method on around 10 other services. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/mcncl"> /u/mcncl </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1hc24pk/newsdemon_will_not_let_me_access_account/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1hc24pk/newsdemon_will_not_let_me_access_account/">[comments]</a></span>
