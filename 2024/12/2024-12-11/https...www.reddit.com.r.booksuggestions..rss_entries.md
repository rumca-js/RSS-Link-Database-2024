<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I was looking for a book similar to &quot;fell in love with hope&quot; by Lancali, &quot;The song of Achiles&quot; by Madaline Miller or even &quot;Wild girls&quot;(? I dont quite recall its name in english) by Rory Power, where we know someone is going to die, yet it still hurts when it happens. Maybe not something fully fiction, but I dont mind if it is, it is just a preference if its possible. I really liked those because I knew from the start they were going to die, but it had twists and turns that made me engage with the story, and made it burn. Can someone help me out?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi All - I wanted to gift a copy of Manufacturing Consent to a 17 year old family member who is interested in law and history. I am doing a libby listen right now - I haven&#39;t read it in a couple of decades and a) forgot about the graphic details of sexual violence, and b) the intro is admittedly out of date. While I think this is an important historical and academic read, I&#39;m thinking of something different for this family member. Can anyone suggest similar books that discuss the history of media manipulation, propaganda, or something similar? Again, gift is for a 17 year old.

## Fictional Field Guides, Bestiaries, or World Guides like Dragonolgy, but for adults

Specifically something that is written from the perspective of someone within the fictional world or as if the topic they are talking about is real (so not just a book going over cryptids or mythological creature in our world with the understanding that they aren&#39;t real). </p> <p>The closest book I&#39;ve been able to find to the sort of vibe I&#39;m looking for (though still not quite what I&#39;m looking for) is the art book <em>Vermis</em> by Plastiboo (a guidebook for a game that doesn&#39;t actually exist).

Heh, last year his grandmother got him <em>20,000 Leagues Under the Sea</em> and while he got about 2/3 through—much further than I would—suffice it to say Jules Verne wasn’t for him.

I’m all about the tension, drama, and, of course, the happy endings (I need that feel-good vibe). I’m open to pretty much anything, even if it’s a little dark romance—just as long as it ends on a high note!</p> <p>If you’ve got any recommendations for free audiobooks that fit the bill, drop them below! I’m looking for stories with good chemistry and a plot that keeps me hooked.</p> <p>Thanks in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Successful-Tank-851"> /u/Successful-Tank-851 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1hbil8b/looking_for_free_spicy_mxm_audiobook/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1hbil8b/looking_for_free_spicy_mxm_audiobook/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So my ELA teacher has asked me what kind of books I like to read, and I didn&#39;t really know how to answer because I think my taste in books is all over the place. Could someone tack on a genre so that I know a more general description of the books I like? Or if anyone noticed a common theme between a lot of them?</p> <p>Here&#39;s some books I really liked:</p> <p>Under The Banner of Heaven - Jon Krakauer</p> <p>Into Thin Ice - Jon Krakauer</p> <p>One of us is lying -Karen M McManus</p> <p>The Honeys - Ryan LaSala</p> <p>Book Thief - Markus Zusak</p> <p>Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins</p> <p>I find myself kind of gravitating/being interested in a lot of books that deal with power and politics. I&#39;m also a big fan of intercharacter relationships. By that I mean the dynamics and interactions between characters.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/CanadianCoyote1"> /u/CanadianCoyote1 </a> <br/> <sp

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I LOVED “the lives we bury” and “touching spirit bear” ‼️ I think it’s because the male character gets injured and close to death. Especially when it’s multiple times. Also I LOVE mystery and angsty books. I don’t mind romance. I LOVE MYSTERY, especially crime solving mystery’s AND ESPECIALLY WHEN THE MAIN CHARACTER HAS BAD MORALS. ‼️‼️ or better yet, the main character is evil theirself.

## Fantasy or sci-fi murder mysteries like The Tainted Cup by Robert Jackson Bennett

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I recently finished The Tainted Cup by Robert Jackson Bennett and adored it. It was one of only a few five star reads for me this year. If you aren&#39;t familiar, it&#39;s a fantasy/biopunk spin on Sherlock Holmes, from the pov of the Watson analogue. It&#39;s got some fantastic world building (<span class="md-spoiler-text">are the kaiju people??? write faster Robert I need to know</span>) and a true whodunnit with just enough clues for me to solve about 80% into the book but not so early that I was bored during the reveal. Plus a neat little lowkey LGBT romance in there as a bonus. There will eventually be a sequel, but I can&#39;t wait that long!</p> <p>I&#39;m fairly new to the mystery genre, and I&#39;m struggling to find books in the same vein because mystery is so frequently lumped in with thrillers. I am specifically looking for murder mysteries with sci-fi/fantasy elements.</p> <p>Some other things I&#39;ve already read / related things:</p>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’ve been recently getting reading again and I’ve been wanting to find an actual book to read instead of just reading stories off ao3 and other websites like that. I like ao3 with all the original works on there but I’d prefer an actual book.</p> <p>I’m mostly interested in thrillers, mysteries, crime fiction, etc. shit like that. But fine with really anything as long as it actually had rememberable characters that don’t have any personality or actual character to them.</p> <p>&amp; im also I’m fine with poetry, novels, memoirs, and other things like that.</p> <p>I really like Dan Poblocki’s books and I’ve been wanting to read “That’s not my name” by Megan Lally and “the song of Achilles” for a while.</p> <p>PLSS give me some suggestions also sorry if any punctuation or whatever is messed up, I’m really tired rn😭</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/why_is_th1s_s0_hard"> /u/why_is_th1s_s0_hard </a> <b

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>What I mean is I keep finding myself liking media with a pretty young cast (like teenage to twenty somethings) and I&#39;m kind of tired of it . would really love some books with older characters, like 30/40s or middle aged range ( i dont consider this age range old at all thats why the title is in quotes lol thats just what i&#39;m looking for ) . Anything older than that is not preferred but thats totally fine too.</p> <p>While I don&#39;t have a specific genre in mind , i&#39;m not looking for nonfiction . I really like mystery/sci-fi/fantasy and also kinda wanna look into military fiction but anything will do.</p> <p>EDIT: I COMPLETELY NEGLECTED TO MENTION: I really dont like reading romance in books and would prefer as little of it as possible . A small subplot is fine but a wholly romance book is not for me</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/darkestviiolet"> /u/darkestviiolet </a> <br/> <span>
