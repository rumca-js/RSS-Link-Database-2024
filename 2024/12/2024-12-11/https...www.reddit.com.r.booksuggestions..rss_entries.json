I dont quite recall its name in english) by Rory Power, where we know someone is going to die, yet it still hurts when it happens. Maybe not something fully fiction, but I dont mind if it is, it is just a preference if its possible. I really liked those because I knew from the start they were going to die, but it had twists and turns that made me engage with the story, and made it burn. Can someone help me out?

I am doing a libby listen right now - I haven&#39;t read it in a couple of decades and a) forgot about the graphic details of sexual violence, and b) the intro is admittedly out of date. While I think this is an important historical and academic read, I&#39;m thinking of something different for this family member. Can anyone suggest similar books that discuss the history of media manipulation, propaganda, or something similar? Again, gift is for a 17 year old.

The first narrative follows the mans travels, the second narrative follows letters sent to the man from his travel companion a year after the adventure is over, the third follows the man&#39;s different ancestors over the centuries. The title has something to do with light or brightness. The author also plays with the format of the text in interesting ways. Does anyone know this book I really want to recommend it to someone.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Rydog_XD\"> /u/Rydog_XD </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1hbxgbb/looking_for_the_name_of_a_book_i_remember_reading/\">[link]</a></span> &#32;",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;ve been feeling nostalgic recently for the fictional field guilds I used to read as a kid about how to raise dragons or about the biology of fictional creatures and was wondering if anyone knew of any books in the same vein but more geared towards adults? Specifically something that is written from the perspective of someone within the fictional world or as if the topic they are talking about is real (so not just a book going over cryptids or mythological creature in our world with the understanding that they aren&#39;t real). </p> <p>The closest book I&#39;ve been able to find to the sort of vibe I&#39;m looking for (though still not quite what I&#39;m looking for) is the art book <em>Vermis</em> by Plastiboo (a guidebook for a game that doesn&#39;t actually exist). Any help would be appreciated! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/a-mud-monster\"> /u/a-mud-monster </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"ht",

I\u2019ve recently had this itch that I\u2019m craving to be scratched in a book and I wouldn\u2019t even know where to begin to start looking for what I want. </p> <p>I really dig disturbing, immoral and macabre science. Not like sci-fi lasers and talking animals, but very in-depth even inhumane science experiments. Viruses, parasites, you name it. I like quite dark reads with characters that aren\u2019t very good people. I\u2019m big onto diving into the more sinister sides of humanity and all the undoing of people that comes with it. Other themes I love that could work with this idea is asylums, religion, cults, hospitals and what not. </p> <p>I\u2019m open to more emotional character studies or books with more of a proper storyline to them, either works! I\u2019m super open to any suggestions even slightly similar, any help is hugely appreciated &lt;3 </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Stinkymaroon\"> /u/Stinkymaroon </a> ",

I&#39;ve been reading a lot of action comedy as well but am willing to go into any genre that relates to its own comedy. Tim Dorsey is one of my favorite authors and I think Robert Crais has a similar wit to him. I really wanted to get into The Lust Lizard of Melancholy Cove but it reminded me of an episode of Loudermilk but with more crime (I didn&#39;t get very far into the book either but am thinking about rereading it).

It&#39;s got some fantastic world building (<span class=\"md-spoiler-text\">are the kaiju people??? write faster Robert I need to know</span>) and a true whodunnit with just enough clues for me to solve about 80% into the book but not so early that I was bored during the reveal. Plus a neat little lowkey LGBT romance in there as a bonus. There will eventually be a sequel, but I can&#39;t wait that long!</p> <p>I&#39;m fairly new to the mystery genre, and I&#39;m struggling to find books in the same vein because mystery is so frequently lumped in with thrillers.
