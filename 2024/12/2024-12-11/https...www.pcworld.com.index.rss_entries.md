<p>Microsoft continues to test out new ways of showcasing Copilot within Windows. The latest? A compact view that can be opened with the Alt+Space shortcut.</p>



<p>Microsoft is <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2024/12/10/update-for-copilot-for-windows-begins-rolling-out-to-windows-insiders/?utm_source=syndication">touting</a> the new Copilot app as a “native” app, not just the Progressive Web App (PWA) that Microsoft had transformed Copilot into earlier this year. But there’s no indication that Copilot will run locally on your PC, and Windows Central <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/windows-11/surprise-microsofts-new-native-copilot-app-for-windows-11-is-still-just-a-website">discovered</a> that the app still just calls Microsoft’s Copilot website.</p>



<p>So what’s new? Not much. The new Copilot opens as a more comp

<p>Mini PCs may be tiny, but that doesn’t mean they have to lack power. Indeed, there are options out there like the Beelink EQR6, which is packed with performance — and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beelink-Computer-PCIE4-0-Display-1000Mbps/dp/B0DBLK132C/">on sale for $349 at Amazon right now</a>, a good 27 percent off its original price.</p>



<p>This little thing is an absolute beast. It features an AMD Ryzen 9 6900HX processor and a jaw-dropping 24GB of DDR5 RAM. It’s an explosive rocket that will boot your operating system in seconds, load apps and games in a snap, and multitask browser tabs with ease.</p>



<p>The only downside is that it lacks a dedicated graphics card, but with the integrated AMD Radeon 680M, you can still use it for moderate gaming. And with the 500GB SSD on board, you’ll have plenty of space to store all your apps, games, photos

## Google unveils ‘Willow’ quantum chip that smashes all modern records

<p>Google just <a href="https://blog.google/technology/research/google-willow-quantum-chip/">showed off Willow to the world</a>, its mind-blowing quantum chip that absolutely destroyed an intensive benchmark. What would normally take today’s fastest supercomputers about 10 septillion years to complete — or 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 years — was accomplished in just 5 minutes with Willow.</p>



<p>Willow isn’t just a technological triumph, though. It’s a full-blown scientific breakthrough in quantum computing research. Google has <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08449-y">published a study in <em>Nature</em></a> that addresses one of the biggest challenges in quantum technology: error correction. The study shows that as more “qubits” are added to a quantum computer, the better the error suppression becomes, making the technology more

<p>If you’re a <em>Fortnite</em> addict, and you got charged for an unwanted in-game item, and you filed the right paperwork, you might be getting a check in the mail soon. The money is coming from the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) after collecting a huge $520 million fine from developer Epic. According to the FTC, it’s sending out over 600,000 individual payments in recompense.</p>



<p>The total refund heading out to gamers is <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/refunds/fortnite-refunds">$72 million so far</a>, which is only about a third of the total $245 million refund Epic has agreed to pay (on top of $275 million in other damages). Epic is getting an <s>epic</s> dramatic regulatory smack because it “unlawfully charged players for unwanted purchases, let children rack up unauthorized charges without their parents’ permission, and blocked some u

<p>Back in the 90s, my sister and I shared a hand-me-down RCA TV. It was color, but it had ye olde UHF and VHF dials, no remote, wood paneling, and I hooked up my Sega Genesis to it with a screwdriver. A new deliberately retro TV/monitor is giving me a lot of those same vibes, and this one won’t throw out my back.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://jp.japannext.com/products/jn-v236g180f-retro/">JapanNext JN-V236G180F-Retro</a> won’t win any awards for its specifications — or its alphabet soup of a product name — but it’s not trying to. This 23.6-inch 1080p display is trying to give your desk the look of an oh-so-self-aware retro TV show, perhaps something from the Time Variance Authority on <em>Loki</em>. It’s rocking big chunky bezels, faux wood paneling, and two gigantic dials for OSD controls that will look familiar to any child of the 1980s.</p>

<p>When you need extra storage space on your smartphone, security camera, dashcam, or Nintendo Switch, a fast microSD is what you want — and the Samsung Pro Plus is a fantastic option, especially on sale.</p>



<p>Right now, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-microSD-MicroSDXC-MB-MD256SA-AM/dp/B0C1PPWTWT/">256GB version is down to $20 on Amazon</a>, a whopping 50 percent off its original price.</p>



<p>The Samsung Pro Plus microSD is fast indeed, with read and write speeds of up to 180MB/s and 130MB/s, respectively. That’s speedy enough to transfer files between devices without twiddling your thumbs, but also enough to record up to 4K video without losing frames. It’s the perfect memory card for dashcams, drones, and GoPros.</p>



<p>And yes, you’ll be able to use this microSD in pretty much any device you have, from smartphones and tablets to se

<p>In the past, gaming laptops would last anywhere from two to four hours on a single charge — a woefully short duration compared to their non-gaming counterparts. Powerful hardware like heavy-duty graphics cards requires a lot of energy to run, thus draining the battery. </p>



<p>But trends have changed in recent years thanks to advances in cooling technology, more power efficient hardware, and battery saving software. Nowadays, you can easily score a gaming laptop that lasts a full workday. Let’s dig into the details of these welcome improvements.</p>

<p>Some people can hardly remember the time before YouTube. The video host was founded in 2005, and year after year the platform got bigger and bigger. As early as 2006, around 100 million clips were viewed there every day. By 2010, this figure had risen to <a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/at-five-years-two-billion-views-per-day/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more than two billion per day</a>. Today, users upload around 500 hours of video material <a href="https://www.googlewatchblog.de/2021/12/youtube-nutzer-stunden-videomaterial-2-chip/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">every minute</a>.</p>



<p>No wonder, really. The largely free service offers almost endless entertainment, how-to and tutorial videos, music, and much more. Of course, users also have the opportunity to upload videos themselves, collect followers, and ea
