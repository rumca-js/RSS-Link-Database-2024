I found I can provide quite a few requests on TL&#39;s request page but to become a seeder there you need a proven record of seeding through other sites. Other requirements are uploading an insane amount of torrents a week - I don&#39;t have time to do this all day every day.</p> <p>I&#39;ve looked into signing up through

I&#39;ve noticed alot of people have had success building servers with the HP 290 but was just wondering how I would access content from that?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>New to all of this piracy stuff, so was wondering if Spotifys recent API change is the reason that my Spotify crack no longer works as intended? </p> <p>I was using an 8.5 version with no problems whatsoever, just couldn&#39;t download music (oh well, understandable). That suddenly stopped working and said I had no music in any playlists. So I tried an 8.8 version to the same conclusions. Only 8.9+ versions work, but very poorly at that (can&#39;t queue a song, sometimes can&#39;t select an individual song, rarely able to restart a song by pressing the arrow back button)</p> <p>If this is due to the API change, how long can we expect to have an almost fully working crack again? </p> <p>Additions: - xManager does not work in my case, 3 of 5 of my attempts came from there and they suffer the issues stated above. - Tried a VPN but was unable to change my account location to the USA, remains stuck in Canada</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#3
