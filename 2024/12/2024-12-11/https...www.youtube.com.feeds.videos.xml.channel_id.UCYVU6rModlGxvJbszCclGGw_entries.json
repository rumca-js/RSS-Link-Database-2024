        "description": "In part 1 of the PsyOp Series, I revealed a specific PsyOp currently being run. Now that a PsyOp has been started, it is now expected that counter-PsyOps will also now run and the average normie will be victimized further and more societal divisiveness would be expected to occur. In this video, I give you the players likely to initiate a PsyOp and all the possible players to keep an eye on. Then I will give you specific signs which indicate a PsyOp is currently in action.\n\n-----------------------------------\nBraX3 Privacy Phone is on pre-order on Indiegogo\nhttps://www.indiegogo.com/projects/brax3-the-most-privacy-friendly-smartphone#/\n-----------------------------------\nBrax Virtual Phone, De-Googled Phones, BytzVPN, BraxMail, BraxRouters are available on https://brax.me.
