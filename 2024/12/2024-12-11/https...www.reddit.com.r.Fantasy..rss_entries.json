And not harboring a superfan&#39;s perspective. My boyfriend has Kickstarter copies of all 4 and isnt sure he&#39;ll take the wrapping off. </p> <p>Just read it on Kindle from Libby (first library card since college- yay!). Yes, it&#39;s linked to the Cosmere, but it felt like such a breath of fresh air from Roshar or Scadrial. The back and forth between the MCs was so fun when they disagreed and I couldn&#39;t put my phone down! It read more like a fiction in a futuristic, possibly Japanese setting and I was there for it. The Sanderlance part was perfect for that style of book. And the ART throughout- that artist was well chosen. If every fiction book was like that, I think I would have more of them in my reading list!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/E",

I saw that Orbit has some new releases and so I just picked a few at random without even reading the description, I went purely off the cover.</p> <p>This was an easy world to get excited about. I liked the premise pretty much immediately. Our main character is a first time mom with a newborn that&#39;s a couple of months old. As the author mentions in her dedication, she&#39;s a mom, and I think she really nails the surreal feeling it is to be a parent for the first time. It&#39;s really difficult to nail the feeling because it&#39;s just so odd, I can&#39;t even really describe it and I&#39;ve been there done that. It&#39;s a mix of self identity crisis, insane hormones, strongly conflicting feelings that never seem to quite gel together, separate and different but equally strong feelings that pull you in two different directions. She really loves her work, she loves being a Hound and solving crimes",

One thing I really like about TWI is how, in contrast to many similar stories, the main characters aren&#39;t just all powerful warriors/mages or whatever, but instead they take on &quot;more boring classes&quot; like innkeeper, runner, doctor, etc. (it&#39;s kind of a litrpg, so there&#39;s classes and stuff). What annoys me tho, is they still feel to heroic to me; I want the MC to just do whatever they want and explore magic, explore the world instead of playing the hero and saving it. But the main reason I&#39;ve stopped enjoying TWI as much is the sheer amount of side character POV chapters. Having a few such chapters sprinkled in every now and then is cool, but it&#39;s gotten so bad that getting a main chapter has become a rarity and I really just don&#39;t give a shit about 80% of the side chapters, so yeah...</p> <p>I don",

The pacing was off, the characters (including the MC) felt flat, the world building a little uninspired, and it was oddly preachy at times (both about religion and class).</p> <p>It\u2019s odd because these are all things that Alex Verus excelled at. With Alex Verus I couldn\u2019t put the book down; they were fun, fast paced, but with a real emotional impact and weight to it (including the themes of injustice of wealth and power Jacka was not so subtly trying to convey in this book), where the consequences of Alex\u2019s actions slowly piled up. I felt none of that with an Inheritance of Magic, and even felt like it has a much less mature tone.</p> <p>Does anybody else feel this way, or am I being overly critical?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/The4thStranger\"> /u/The4thStranger </a>",
