<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey,<br/> I&#39;m a new hire in a sw company and they gave me the task to manage the UART communication. Everything goes wonders in reception, but when I try to write back, either using direct register access or via termios POSIX interface, the interrupts stop answering.<br/> Even after I reload the executable, the problem persists.

## Where are RISC-V GPUs?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I found out that RISC-V exists 2 days ago, and I was researching things about RISC-V for those 2 days for a few hours. So it is basically a standartised set of instructions (and bit encoding of those instructions), with a standartised additional instructions sets (like atomics), which allows for code compiled once as RISC-V instructions to run on all machines implementing RISC-V (and apropriate extensions), with backward compatibility. </p> <p>Most effort is going towards developing ISA for CPUs. GPUs are similar to CPUs in many ways, and there could be ISA extensions for GPU instructions. But I did not find almost any information about GPUs running on RISC-V instructions beeing developed. Why? Is it planned but not started yet to develop, or are there deeper challenges with it? </p> <p>I am asking because it seems that standartisation of GPUs ISA has the same benefits as for CPUs. Maybe it has major drawbacks which RISC-V ISA for CPUs don&#39;t have
