My non-spoiler thoughts on The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim!  I will have a full-on spoiler video coming soon where we can get into my very specific praises and criticisms of the film, but for now, I wanted to cover some key characters and elements and give you my initial vibe for the film.

At the end of the day, this is a SOLID Middle-earth film.  Other adaptations (those before and those to come) would do well to learn from how Rohirrim expands on Tolkien's fragments with mostly great choices.
