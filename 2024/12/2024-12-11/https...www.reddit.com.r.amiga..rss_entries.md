## A3000 and ZuluSCSI

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Im having some troubles with my A3000 with ZuluSCSI RP2040 Compact setup. Problem is that Bars &amp; Pipes, ScalaMM and most WHDLoad games freeze the machine about two-three seconds after launch. The chassis HDD LED is continously on and the ZuluSCSI is blinking. No reboot or guru, the screen turn black after a while and it just hangs.</p> <p>Ive tried to launch B&amp;P from floppy, no issues. Ive tried copying it into to RAM, and it launches fine. Everything also works when booting the SD card in WinUAE, all mentioned software runs fine there. Ive also tried swapping the SCSI cable.</p> <p>As far as I can tell this rules out anything but the ZuluSCSI or the inbuilt SCSI interface. Am I missing something here? Does anyone have an idea what my issue might be?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Roedrev"> /u/Roedrev </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1hbgyfb/a3000_and_zul
