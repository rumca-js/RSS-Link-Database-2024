<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>In the past few days, two widely used apps in Turkey have fallen victim to cyberattacks. Users received unauthorized notifications, including offensive messages and even demands for Bitcoin payments.</p> <p>What makes this even more concerning is the root cause: API keys hardcoded into the client-side applications. This kind of oversight is unfortunately more common than you’d think, especially in apps that don’t follow proper security practices.</p> <p>The attackers exploited this vulnerability to breach the messaging services of these apps, sending messages directly to users. While the companies have since acknowledged the breaches and claim that no sensitive data was compromised, it still raises important questions: • How many more apps out there are shipping with poorly protected or hardcoded API keys? • Why are such basic security oversights still happening in widely used services?</p> <p>This incident is a wake-up call for developers and organi

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey all, I am thinking of doing a little personal project to both learn skills and do a small fix for something that annoys me. Basically, I have a pair of Bluetooth earbuds (Nothing Ear Stick). The app doesn&#39;t allow disabling certain touch controls, which is really annoying if you are working out and it just triggers because it brushed your hair or you tilted your head. I&#39;d love to be able to disable it myself. </p> <p>How would I go about &#39;fixing&#39; this in a software context? I&#39;m guessing I have to download the firmware, learn how it&#39;s coded, and alter it?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Sorreljorn"> /u/Sorreljorn </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1hbp9kw/tips_for_a_small_reverse_engineering_project/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1hbp9kw/tips_for_a_small_reverse_engineering_project/">[co
