As a healthy teenager with an upper middle class upbringing, my only first hand knowledge of health care system was getting shots, physicals, etc. Nothing major.</p> <p>Watching this movie opened my eyes to the horrors of our health care system and has stayed with me all these years. I know it isn&#39;t a great movie by any means but it made an impression on me of a man who would do anything for his child in a system you expect to help him. Instead you learn how bad the system is and what is forces a man of conviction to do.</p> <p>As with the news, I flashed back to this moving thinking of what drives a man to violence when he is trampled by the system.
