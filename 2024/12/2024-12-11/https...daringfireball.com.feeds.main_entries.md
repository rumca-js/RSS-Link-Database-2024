  <p>Apple today made a mistake with its macOS Sequoia 15.2 update,
releasing the software for two Macs that have yet to be launched.
There is a software file for “Mac16,12” and “Mac16,13,” which are
upcoming MacBook Air models.</p>

<p>The leaked software references the “MacBook Air (13-inch, M4,
2025)” and the “MacBook Air (15-inch, M4, 2025),” confirming that
new M4 MacBook Air models are in development and are likely not
too far off from launching.</p>

<p>It’s been widely rumored that Apple is working to bring the M4
chips to its entire Mac lineup, and the MacBook Air is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/2025-macbook-air/" title="MacRumors: “Apple's 2025 M4 MacBook Air: What to Expect”">expected to
get an M4 refresh</a> in the spring of 2025, so sometime between March
and June.</p>
