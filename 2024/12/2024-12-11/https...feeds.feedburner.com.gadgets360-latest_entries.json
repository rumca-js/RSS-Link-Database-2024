The copper used originated from Austrian mines operational during the Early Bronze Age, supporting its historical authenticity. Adorned with gold symbols of celestial bodies, the disc is viewed as an early astronomical chart and remains on display at the Saxony-Anhalt State Museum of Prehistory.",

The flare, accompanied by a coronal mass ejection (CME), ionised Earth\u2019s upper atmosphere, absorbing radio signals and causing blackouts in areas exposed to peak solar activity. Experts predict the CME will likely graze Earth by December 11, causing minor geomagnetic disturbances. Space Weather Physicist Dr Tamitha Skov suggested that fast solar winds could deflect the CME further west, reducing its potential impact.",

Found alongside the bust were 337 coins, oil lamps, a bronze ring, and other artefacts linked to the Ptolemaic period.
