<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am a medical student from India and wanted to know if radiologists will become less valuable in the future. I am currently waiting to be matched into a residency program. In India, there is a shortage of radiologists, which is why they have a higher salary compared to other postgraduate specialties. How long will it take before AI could replace radiologists&#39; jobs?(I am sure that hospitals would like to reduce the staff in the radiology department if they could)Will it happen in the next 10-15 years?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Consistent-Key-1566"> /u/Consistent-Key-1566 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1hc0xge/should_i_avoid_pursuing_a_radiology_residency/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1hc0xge/should_i_avoid_pursuing_a_radiology_residency/">[comments]</a></span>
