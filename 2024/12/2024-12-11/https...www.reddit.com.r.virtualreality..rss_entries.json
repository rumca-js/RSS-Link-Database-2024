I&#39;m intending to play on my PC for most games, but standalone provides variety if nothing else. I&#39;ve a 4070 Ti and a 3900X.</p> <p>For using a Quest 3 (most likely quest headset I&#39;d get) I should consider a WiFi 6 router? USB connection is an option but for versatility and comfort the verdict seems to be a router upgrade. I&#39;m aware there are a number of lists of suggested routers so I&#39;ll check those if I&#39;m right that this is worth doing. Being UK based, router switching isn&#39;t something I&#39;m used to but again, plenty of how tos around.</p> <p>For PSVR 2, I&#39;d need the PC adapter, anything other hardware recommended? My understanding here is that it&#39;s hardwired only for pc, so no router worries.</p> <p>How am I wrong? Go</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; s",

Many years ago I had a chance to test a aquintances Quest 2&#39;s and my vision was extremely blurry. I am a person who wears glasses (L-3 R-2.5) but I see things good up close. I can see the monitor hands lenght away somewhat sharply, beyond that no hope. Anyway, the goggles I had access to hadn&#39;t been worn so It most likely wasn&#39;t condensation. At first the vision was so bad that the CS VR equivelant was hard to play. I could see the silhouette of a person standing at the end of a well lit hallway but not much else. 10-20 minutes later it got a little better, I could see details like them wearing a ski mask and a vest, but small details were still a blur.</p> <p>We tried switching games but the blur still persisted. The blur was consistent troughout the vision.</p> <p>Was something wrong with the goggles or are my eyes incompatitable with the VR gaming universe?</p> </div><!-- ",

Is it possible to either flash the consumer equivalent version of the firmware to the headset? If not, is sideloading an option? I wish to use the pico motion trackers with it. I&#39;m pretty sure both the consumer, and the business model have relatively the same hardware- so if I was able to either flash, or sideload the motion connect app directly to the pico, it should work.

Would it make the videos look better / smoother? More specifically VR 180 and 360 Videos.

I had both of my natural lenses replaced with artificial lenses. My new eyes are great, and I no longer need to wear glasses at all.</p> <p>The problem is in that I had one eye corrected for distance and the other corrected for near vision. Over time your brain learns to meld the two images so that you have pretty good vision at all distances.</p> <p>I&#39;ve found that the eye corrected for distance seems to view the images in the headset better than the eye corrected for near vision, which seems counter intuitive. </p> <p>My question though, what should I be looking at for a prescription to clear up vision in-headset for the near-vision eye? The ophthalmologist didn&#39;t know if correcting the near-vision eye to match the distance vision eye would help in clearing it up or not, due to a lack of practical knowledge of VR.</p> <p>So, anyon",
