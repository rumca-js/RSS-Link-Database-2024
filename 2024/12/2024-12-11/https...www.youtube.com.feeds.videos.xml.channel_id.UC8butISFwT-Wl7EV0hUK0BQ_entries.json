The course is structured in two parts: first covering essential Elasticsearch fundamentals including index management, document storage, text analysis, pipeline creation, search functionality, and advanced features like semantic search and embeddings; followed by a practical section where you'll build a real-world website using Elasticsearch as a search engine, working with the Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) dataset to implement features such as data cleaning pipelines, tokenization, pagination, and aggregations.\n\n\u270f\ufe0f Course developed by @3CodeCampers \n\n\u2b50\ufe0f Links \u2b50\ufe0f\nHere is the link to the GitHub repository to get slides, notebooks and the source code for the final project: https://github.com/ImadSaddik/ElasticSearch_Python_Tutorial \nLink to the 3CodeCamp YouTube channel: https:/",
