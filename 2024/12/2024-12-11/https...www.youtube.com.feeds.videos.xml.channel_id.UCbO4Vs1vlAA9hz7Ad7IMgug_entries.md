It's the first ever episode of the GMG Indie Hour. This series focuses on games you may have never even heard of and gives us an inside look at the wider world of independantly published Tabletop Wargames of all genres!

In this inaugural episode we're going to lay out the format - One game suggested by Patrons and one game I think needs more HYPE. Longtime Patron Jez Hunt threw out 2024's Devilry Afoot for our first looks and #28MAG's LOBSTERPOT for a game I think deserves more Hype!

The Grand Narrative for Warhammer 40,000 was a seven game LARP using the results of games of 40k an Kill Team to tell a larger story amongst three major facts! The Imperials, Orks and Chaos all vied for a series of ancient relics. In this first Mission, teams are sent into the warzone to determine the location and details of these relics in an Asset Sweep!

Jay and I are both using custom forces as a fun excuse to build an emerging narrative, with the Legionnaires of the Dark Angels taking on my Rogue Trader Inquisitorial Agents!
