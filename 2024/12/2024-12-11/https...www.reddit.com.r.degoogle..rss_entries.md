## Degoogle with GrapheneOS and Fdroid

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I would like to flash GrapheneOS on my phone. But I&#39;ve got a couple of concerns. 1. I saw that the stock Camera app has very few features and doesn&#39;t use the full potential that this phone has got. 2. I actually never used Fdroid, how is it? Does it update the apps automatically or do I have to do it manually. 3. What about paid apps, for example games. How do I get games or generally speaking apps that cost without pirating them? 4. Is it safe to download apk&#39;s from for example Fdroid? If I&#39;ve got more questions I&#39;m going to write them in the comment section. Thanks in advance:)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Eldergrise"> /u/Eldergrise </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/degoogle/comments/1hc1coi/degoogle_with_grapheneos_and_fdroid/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/degoogle/comments/1hc1coi/degoogle_with_grapheneos_and_fdroid

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey there!<br/> As the title suggests I am trying to find a more private alternative to the maps timeline. More often than I would like to admit it was very helpful <em>for me</em> to check where I have been and when. So I enabled the timeline. Very bad, I know.<br/> As I am installing Graphene OS as we speak I&#39;d like to go ahead and ditch the timeline as well.</p> <p>Do you know of any more private way to track your location regularly? Maybe even logging it only on the device?</p> <p>Thanks in advance :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/TrochiTV"> /u/TrochiTV </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/degoogle/comments/1hbz8a1/private_maps_timeline/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/degoogle/comments/1hbz8a1/private_maps_timeline/">[comments]</a></span>
