<p>Google is rolling out version 2.0 of its Gemini AI model today for the web. But the real news is what Google calls “Deep Research,” which attempts to mimic how actual humans research a subject and develop a report on it.</p>



<p>It’s yet another tool that students have available to them, and one that probably will scare teachers who worry about <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2420070/can-ai-be-used-ethically-for-school-work-heres-what-teachers-say.html">AI being used for cheating</a> even more.</p>

<p>Nowadays, it’s easier than ever to boost your productivity even when you’re working out of coffee shops, all because portable monitors are affordable and light enough to carry along with your laptop.</p>



<p>And right now, one of our favorite portable laptop displays is on sale: the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-ZenScreen-Portable-Monitor-MB166C/dp/B09MZQ978N/">Asus ZenScreen is down to $89 on Amazon</a>, a 36 percent discount off its original $139 price and its best-ever price.</p>



<p>This particular portable monitor features a 15.6-inch IPS display with 1080p resolution and an anti-glare coating, making it easier on your eyes during those long work hours spent in front of your laptop. Oh, and if you ever need to use the monitor vertically, it will automatically adjust the orientation to portrait mode (and back again).</p>

<p>I can’t go a week without someone illegally calling me about a small business loan or car insurance, and despite coming from a local phone number, I’m fairly certain they aren’t from around here.</p>



<p>Such spammers are usually using Voice over IP (VOIP) to fake phone numbers, and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is as fed up as the rest of us. It’s threatening to shut down thousands of VOIP services.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-could-block-over-2400-providers-robocall-mitigation-database">press release issued yesterday</a>, the FCC says 2,411 of these providers “failed to properly file in the Robocall Mitigation database, and must now show cause why they should not be removed.” In other words, these VOIP companies are lightning rods for spammers using their services to spread illegal calls, and they’ve ignored f

<p>It’s hard to believe that it’s already been four years since <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> was released, but yesterday marked the game’s fourth anniversary, a huge milestone for a game with such an eventful development history.</p>



<p>To celebrate the occasion, developer studio CD Projekt RED has released a new update that adds new features to the now-mature game. <a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/us/en/update-2.2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Update 2.2</a> for <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> is already live and brings with it new vehicles, an improved photo mode, new customizations for main character V, and changes to some quests, including several bug fixes.</p>



<p>Overall, the changes aren’t groundbreaking. However, the fact that CD Projekt RED is still making improvements to the game this far after release and providing the community with update

<p>Yesterday was the last Patch Tuesday of 2024, and with it Microsoft has provided a number of security updates, eliminating 71 security vulnerabilities across various Microsoft apps and services.</p>



<p>Microsoft categorizes 16 of these vulnerabilities as “critical” and classifies all but one of the remaining issues as “high risk.” According to the company, one of those Windows security flaws is already being exploited in the wild, so it’s crucial to patch ASAP.</p>



<p>With 1,020 security vulnerabilities patched throughout 2024, this has been the second worst year for Microsoft as far as sheer number of security issues. It was only surpassed once, in 2020, which saw 1,250 security vulnerabilities across the year.</p>



<p>Microsoft offers sparse details on these vulnerabilities in its <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/" target="_blank"

<p>There are plenty of Matter-enabled smart plugs on the market, but <em>in</em>-wall smart outlets with Matter are much tougher to find. Now, TP-Link’s Tapo smart home brand has entered the fray with a Matter outlet that can help you save on your energy bill. </p>



<p>On sale now, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DLLQR3K7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tapo P210M</a> joins a select few in-wall smart outlets with Matter, including the <a href="https://www.evehome.com/en-us/eve-energy-outlet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eve Energy Outlet</a> (which does Matter-over-Thread) as well as the Zigbee-based <a href="https://eu.aqara.com/en-eu/products/aqara-wall-outlet-h2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aqara Wall Outlet H2</a> (an EU-only device that requires the Aqara Zigbee 3.0 Hub). </p>

<p>Last week, news broke of an extensive espionage campaign—Chinese hackers infiltrating eight US telecommunications companies and gaining access to text and phone conversations. Not long after, the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) issued a recommendation: Use encrypted messaging.</p>



<p>At least, that idea dominated headlines around the web. But dig into the news from outlets like the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/china-hack-us-telecoms-salt-typhoon-88cabc592dae2fa870772c5ce4ace5ea">Associated Press</a> and more nuanced information emerges. In particular, the targets were government officials and politicians, with the number affected a “low, couple dozen.”</p>



<p>If you’re like me, an average person who binges Netflix instead of tracking every new geopolitical development as it happens, you may wonder how relevant the FBI’s suggestion is.

<p>The iPad Pro is Apple’s most powerful tablet but it’s also the most expensive, so we’re always on the lookout for a good deal. And today we’ve got one: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3J98W75">Amazon is selling the 13-inch iPad Pro for $1,099 right now</a>, a savings of $200 and matching its Black Friday all-time low.</p>



<p>Apple updated the iPad Pro in May with the brand-new M4 chip from Apple, a 13-inch Ultra Retina XDR OLED display, and an incredibly thin design that’s just 5.1mm. Even with a giant screen, it’s still plenty portable and perfect for work, gaming, binging Apple TV+ shows, and just about anything else. It also features a generous 256GB of storage space, more than enough for tons of apps, files, and whatever else you want to store. And of course, it’s ready for Apple Intelligence as it continues to roll out with iPadOS 18.2 and be
