Why does this issue provoke such fierce debate?</p><ul><li>This essay first appeared under the title <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/why-i-want-my-deaf-daughter-to-have-the-best-of-both-worlds">The Cochlear Question</a> on <a href="https://aeon.co/">Aeon.co</a></li></ul><p>I knew my daughter could hear: not just because she loved music, but because she had perfect rhythm. She punched her fists in the air like a human metronome, and brought a doughy heel to the ground precisely on each downbeat. I had thrown off the yoke of milestone-tracking months earlier, having become fixated on her inability to roll during the precise developmental week for rolling. So when she didn’t form consonants at the prescribed time, I made a deliberate choice to ignore it. It didn’t occur to me that deafness might not be a binary, and that certain vibrations and p

<p>If you really care, get us an upgrade of a bargain-basement product you’ve spotted us using.

<p>It would normally be over by now, the Champions League group stage done and dusted and yet there are still two more ties for Arsenal; a test of their physicality, the depth of their reserves as well as their resolve. The idea is to play the extra games in January and make sure they do not have to play two more in the playoff round in February; to zoom straight into the round of 16. It continues to look pretty good.</p><p>This was the toughest tie Arsenal had left in the elongated group phase and Mikel Arteta had wanted to make it count. His team did exactly that. Bukayo Saka brought the cutting edge, his opening goal aided and abetted by Myles Lewis-Skelly, assured on a full debut at this rarefied level. When Saka scored his second, it was to kill off a Monaco revival that probably should not have been possible.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/dec/11/arsenal-monaco-champions-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

Many of the new venues have been designed by the US firm Populous, which also has a headquarters in London. Its work includes Spurs’ home and Lusail Stadium, which hosted the 2022 World Cup final. The visuals are dramatic and the ambition sweeping: King Salman Stadium in Riyadh will hold 92,000, staging the opening game and final. Prince Mohammed bin Salman Stadium, another Riyadh venue, has perhaps been the most widely trailed with its futuristic desig

I was unused to the concept, apart from writing to Santa as a kid.

The England defender, who made his first Champions League start of the season at Girona on Tuesday, admits it has been difficult to sit out but he is relishing the chance to play after an injury to Ibrahima Konaté. “I love the club, I love being here,” he said.</p><p>A deal had been in place for Gomez to join Newcastle for £45m with Anthony Gordon going in the other direction for £75m but the sales of Elliot Anderson and Yankuba Minteh to Nottingham Forest and Brighton respectively allowed Newcastle to meet profit and sustainability targets. That left Gomez at Anfield, where he is the longest-serving player, but behind Virgil van Dijk and Konaté.

Yet, on a crisp November day, Amboy thrummed with friends and travelers swapping stories about the area’s history, the family that saved it, and the road that led them there.</p><p>“It’s the mother road,” said Digger Simpson, 61, gesturing towards the legendary Route 66 that once was the nation’s main artery for travel from Chicago to Santa Monica, California. “It’s Americana – it’s mom-and-pop restaurants and gas stations,” he added, reflecting on the nostalgia that drew him from Twentynine Palms to Amboy to celebrate Albert Okura, the man credited with injecting life back into the town.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/11/americ

Largely wordless and laden with reverb, Enji’s intricate vocalisations span everything from the percussive whispers of sharp breath on Akin to yearning, drawn-out phrases on Cathedral and the sprightly rhythms of Ybbs. Popp, meanwhile, accompanies with melodic drum textures, including interlocking patterns on toms and tuned percussion.

<p><strong>Barbican, London</strong><br>The London Symphony Orchestra’s concert performance under their chief conductor made a compelling case for Puccini’s little-performed opera</p><p>La Rondine remains the sleeper among Puccini’s mature works. Not only did it have a troubled gestation – working on a commission for a Viennese theatre was a tad awkward once Italy was at war with Austria – but opera houses have never really embraced it. The problem is not the score, which teems with charm and melody, but the dramatic stakes, which remain stubbornly low. Where Bohème, Butterfly and Tosca are seldom off the boil, La Rondine rarely rises above a simmer. That said, Antonio Pappano and the London Symphony Orchestra made an especially compelling case for it, Pappano’s evident affection for the music coming across in every turbocharged bar of this heartfelt and detailed performance.</p><p>The story of Magda, a Parisian courtesan who flees to the French Riviera with her provincial lover to c

<p>Invisible Dog by Fabio Morábito; Indeterminate Inflorescence by Lee Seong-bok; The Epic of Cader Idris by Samatar Elmi; A Kiss for the Absolute by Shūzō Takiguchi</p><p><strong><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/invisible-dog-9781800174511/">Invisible Dog</a> by Fabio Morábito, translated by Richard Gwyn (Carcanet, £12.99)</strong></p><p>Mexican writer Morábito is a real discovery: reading him is like being in the room with someone who trusts you enough to think aloud. Immaculately translated, this selection covers 40 years’ worth of unusually direct and intimate work. It mostly consists of columnar, free-verse poems that track the light and dark of thought and are by turns witty, sentimental, proverbial and nostalgic. In Journey to Pátzcuaro, dignity collapses into laughter when with “the radiance / of my sixteen years … I was within a hair’s breadth / of acting my age”. Thirty years later, the speaker calculates that “All distances / were born from the fruit / that we must pi

<p>In a viral post, the Hendrix family from Chicago lamented British bad manners.  But I beg to differ – people in London are just ‘big city polite’</p><p>If you are an American hoping to ingratiate yourself with the local people while on a trip to London, I have some tips. First: smile at strangers on the train. You have to really try to hold eye contact with them; if they scuttle off at the next stop looking terrified, chase after them, asking how their day is going. Londoners love that. They also love it when you stand in the middle of the escalator, blocking their way; that is a great ice-breaker. If all else fails, loudly inform everyone that you are from the US. Everyone loves Americans!</p><p>The above is a hypothetical extract from whatever guidebook the globetrotting Hendrix family – who are from Chicago – must have read before visiting the UK recently. “We’ve travelled the world … but we’ve never felt such coldness as we did in London,” <a href="https://www.instagram.com/re

In politics as in football. Fifa, founded 120 years ago in Paris, is moving to the US. It recently removed Zurich as its headquarters from its statutes and relocated 100 jobs to Miami. And in 2034, the World Cup will take place in Saudi Arabia. Europe is now discussing how to deal with guest workers, human rights and democracy.</p><p>However, the rest of the world no longer cares about European objections. The power has shifted. We don’t even know what will happen to the 2026 World Cup and 2028 Olympics with the US, our most important ally, under Donald Trump. We need to draw the right conclusions from this.

Steve Coogan impersonates the Moore narrative voiceover, mostly reading from his garrulous memoir The 007 Diaries: Filming Live and Let Die, which in a less corporately controlled age Moore was allowed to bring out in 1973 as a tie-in.</p><p>This is a very enjoyable watch for Moore devot

It doesn’t have a lot in common with the long-established and much more famous one down the road – this one tends to be drier, warmer and significantly more attractive to young people.

Living in Brooklyn and working as a financial headhunter, she moved into an apartment building with lots of other people her age. “There were 25 apartments in total and a rooftop where we’d go for parties,” she says. “It was like living in the cast of Friends. Everyone knew each other and we were always in and out of each other’s homes.”</p><p>In the autumn of 1984, one of her neighbours invited her to his family home in New Jersey for Rosh Hashanah, a Jewish new year celebration. As soon as she arrived, she was introduced to his sister, Andrea, a market researcher who also lived in New York.

It refocused attention on what can only be described as the country’s ruling family, led by prime minister Benjamin “Bibi” Netanyahu and his wife Sara. (Their egregious son Yair here emerges with the remarkable distinction of being more rightwing than his parents.)

In some ways, having a wide package holiday business makes it more defensible – there’s more to offer and a lot of cross-selling opportunities. But the drains on cash when you have planes, huge hotels and cruise ships to maintain and fill are enormous, so it was good to see occupancy rates across the business creep higher.

<p>A collection of articles, talks, letters and unpublished writing fills important gaps in the great naturalist’s life story</p><p>‘Gerald Durrell was magic” chirrups David Attenborough across the cover of this collection by the beloved naturalist and author who died in 1995. Chosen by Durrell’s widow ahead of his centenary in January, it includes magazine pieces, radio talks, letters, introductions to other people’s books and a selection from the vast archive of his unpublished writing. What binds the pieces is the signature magic of which Attenborough, whose own career parallels and counterpoints Durrell’s, speaks. It might best be described as the gift of finding wonder everywhere. Here is Durrell, in an unpublished scrap of memoir, on the four years he spent as a child in prewar Corfu. “Leaf to bud, caterpillar to butterfly, tadpole to toad or frog, I was surrounded by miracles. I&nbsp;was surrounded by magic as though Merlin had passed through and casually touched the island wi

<p>A story about a boy deciding whether to enter the criminal underworld or become a student that lacks enough passion and anger to really hit home</p><p>Here is a Mexican crime drama without the crime – or without much of it, taking place chiefly on the margins of serious violence. It is the coming-of-age story of a teenage boy whose dad was a sicario, or cartel killer, in the Tierra Caliente of Michoacán in southern Mexico. Young Sujo (Kevin Aguilar) is at primary school when his father is brutally killed and the killers come looking for the little boy, fearing he will grow up to avenge his dad’s death. Sujo takes refuge at the remote shack belonging to his watchful aunt Nemesia (Yadira Pérez); she becomes his protective family, along with his other aunt Rosalia (Karla Garrido) and his cousins Jai (Alexis Varela) and Jeremy (Jairo Hernandez). Sujo grows to be a teenager (played by Juan Jesús Varela), and flirts with the idea of being a drug runner along with Jai and Jeremy, using h

Then came the injury that shattered my dreams</p><p>When I was 15 I won a scholarship to study at Wells Cathedral school, a specialist music school in Somerset. I had wanted to be a cellist for as long as I could remember. I got up at 5am to play scales, practised at lunchtime and returned to my cello after lessons.

<p>Packed as full of wit, wisdom and jokes as the movies, these four episodes about now 12-year-old Riley’s inner workings are an absolute delight</p><p>The success of the first Inside Out movie in 2015 was so great that it must have taken innumerable acts of will and good faith to stop the powers that be immediately churning out another and another and squeezing the franchise dry as fast as possible. Instead, a sequel to the coming-of-age story of 11-year-old Riley and her increasingly complicated inner life (Joy, Anger, Fear, Disgust and Sadness, voiced by the actors Amy Poehler, Lewis Black, Bill Hader, Mindy Kaling and Phyllis Smith respectively) wasn’t produced until this year. Inside Out 2 introduced an adolescent Riley struggling with the advent of Anxiety (Maya Hawke), Envy (Ayo Edebiri), Embarrassment (Paul Walter Hauser) and a small but scene-stealing dose of Ennui (Adèle Exarchopoulos). It was just as charming, inventive, funny and loving as the first and outdid it at the

<p>Flooding in Tenbury Wells used to be a once in a generation event, now its happening increasingly frequently. <strong>Jessica Murray</strong> reports</p><p>Tenbury Wells is used to floods. But residents of the pretty market town say what used to be a once in a generation event has become exhaustingly frequent. After two floods this winter some businesses in the town say they are on the brink and may have to shut their doors, while the impossibility of getting insurance makes it harder for new businesses to open their doors.</p><p><strong>Jessica Murray</strong> went to the town to find out how people were coping. She found a high street where small businesses said they had come to the end of their resources – and patience. With increased flooding linked to the climate crisis in the UK, <strong>Hannah Moore</strong> asks her if enough is being done to protect the town. Meanwhile, <strong>Helena Horton</strong> explains the problems of flood defences in the UK and how other towns ma
