Subsequently, they just voted to turn the county into a ‚ÄúSuper‚Äù Sanctuary State, and will not cooperate with ICE under the Trump administration. </p><p><br/></p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">BREAKING: The San Diego County Board of Supervisors just voted 3-1 to turn the county into a "super" sanctuary county by shielding illegals from deportation and preventing police from notifying ICE about d

However, a teacher at Conroe Independent School District did just that but fortunately, she was rightfully fired. </p>
<p>Ashley Barrera, a first-grade teacher at Bartlett Elementary School became infuriated because a six-year-old student accidentally lost the bathroom pass. However, the fact that she did not predict that six-year-olds may lose a dumb pass shows how unqualified she was to teach. Nonetheless, this incident infuriated her and she decided the logical thing to do was punish the entire class, preventing them from using the restroom. </p><p><br/></p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">BREAKING: 1st-grade teacher at <a href="https://twitter.com/ConroeISD?ref_src=twsrc%

<p>Newsome went on <em><em>News Nation</em></em> to give her degenerate and reprehensible views on the case and none of it made sense.
