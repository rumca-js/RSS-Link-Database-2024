<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Music tastes evolve dramatically, and sometimes an album I initially didn&#39;t connect with ends up becoming my favorite. Let me know has that happened to you!

## The Downward Spiral is the greatest album of All Time

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>In my honest opinion, I believe The Downward Spiral (1994) is the greatest album to bless the earth, from start to finish it is an unmatched masterpiece in every aspect. Sound design, storytelling, lyrics- it&#39;s got it all. The bar is now impossibly high whenever I listen to anything else.<br/> What do you think?</p> <p>Edit:<br/> I also have to add that there isn&#39;t a single bad song. Every single song is incredible, even the ambient track &quot;A warm place&quot; is an incredible piece of work.<br/> I cannot stress enough how much of a gem this album is. It truly does not compare. And I don&#39;t say this lightly. I&#39;m a gigantic linkin park fan, I even have them tattood on me. I would never give this much praise to LP.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/visbly_confused"> /u/visbly_confused </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1hbhkfr/the_downward_spiral_is_th
