<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>What about this idea for completing short games like COD Modern Warfare 2019, that is uncracked. Buy the game on Steam, play for under 2 hours (you can put your chronometer on your phone), then backup your save files, request a refund. Then you make another account, you buy the game again, use your save files to continue from where you left off, and you repeat the process until you finish the game. I&#39;m thinking it only works for shorter games, where you do this process 2-3 times maximum, otherwise it becomes too complicated and time wasting. COD Modern Warfare 2019 campaign I see can be completed in under 4 hours. But I am not sure if Steam will give you a refund automatically or can your refund be rejected?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/highflyer741"> /u/highflyer741 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CrackSupport/comments/1hbxhtl/buying_refunding_the_game_until_you_finish/
