I haven’t counted but i would guess it’s around 5000 cards. Fully sleeving that would cost nearly $500 which I think probably isn’t worth it. I thought i’d buy a pack of outer sleeves that i can reuse, but i usually build and tear down a new deck with every game and re-sleeving every single game was getting tedious. The outer sleeved cards also didn’t fit in my 3d printed deck holders, which was kind of annoying. So i figured i would probably leave my collection as is.</p> <p>But now i’ve recently bought Earthborne rangers and am really enjoying it, but haven’t bought sleeves yet. Do you think

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>For others that play board games &amp; other games involving 2 or more players. Got a question for you all:</p> <p>If you &amp; a group of people play a board game frequently, like once a week, and one person in that group ALWAYS (every single time playing the game); makes the same moves/plays/decision making... to the point where they&#39;re 100% predictable on what they&#39;ll do... [Question]: does that make it less fun to play with that person? Because they play with no strategy, and you can predict what they&#39;ll do every single time..? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Ok_Artichoke_2804"> /u/Ok_Artichoke_2804 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1hbo1fx/board_game_no_fun_question/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1hbo1fx/board_game_no_fun_question/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a board game from either the late 90s, early 00s that I used to play at my grandparents house that I&#39;ve never been able to remember what it was. </p> <p>It was very similar to Apple&#39;s to Apple&#39;s in terms of gameplay. There was an actual board that you&#39;d move player tokens that were shaped like paper doll chains to keep score. The tokens were brightly colored but would all interlock at the bottom to make a chain standing up.</p> <p>The game involved a series of cards, half with one word on it and the other half with images. The images were basically just stock photos of generic things. Such as an ashtray with a lit cigarette, a rose, an illustration of the devil, a stationary set, a traffic jam, etc. Then the word cards were just like one word that one person would play and you&#39;d match an image to the word. The person whose turn it was would pick the image they liked best and they would win the round just like apples to

So far, I&#39;ve given them a few games such as Wingspan, Scyth, and Dinosaur Island.</p> <p>I was hoping this year to get something we can play with our parents who sometimes have a hard time understanding the complicated mechanics of the other games, like Scyth, but did pretty good with Wingspan after a few rounds. It doesn&#39;t have to be super easy as we&#39;ll usually have someone play on a team with them and they can be adventurous when they&#39;re not tired lol</p> <p>My criteria is a game not exteemely complicated, is unique, and not extremely expensive. Also, we&#39;re suckers for beautiful boardgames, so that&#39;s a must.</p> <p>I&#39;m liking the sound of Azul, Sagrada and Parks.</p> <p>Which would you recommend or are there any others similar to these?
