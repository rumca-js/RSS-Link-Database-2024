The author grew up in an evangelical church and was indoctrinated into fundamentalist Christian beliefs. When she was very young, she married an abusive man and became pulled even deeper into radical Christian beliefs and &quot;tradwife&quot; living. The memoir details her childhood in mainstream evangelicalism, all the way to her eventual escape from her abusive marriage and journey through healing from her trauma.</p> <p>What I found interesting and wanted to discuss with y&#39;all was the parts of Levings&#39; memoir that seem anachronistic(?) and a bit revisionary. Throughout the book, we hear a story of Levings existing in a culture that was aggressively misogynistic, racist, homophobic, you name it. However, throughout this, Levings&#39; inner narrative is <em>conspicuously</em> progressive",

I was going to get a bookmark to track my reading or make one. January is approaching and I haven&#39;t thought it through. I like the idea of treats to keep me motivated.

There are still &quot;hidden gems&quot; I come across and think to note for later, but putting them on my TBR feels like a committment that just haunts me until I read them.

So you can imagine my surprise when I recently stumbled upon a report claiming that Italy ranks fifth in the world for readership. Naturally, this raised a mix of curiosity and skepticism\u2014can such a claim be trusted, or is it an anomaly amidst the usual narrative? While I remain cautious about the source, it did prompt me to reflect on the broader landscape of reading habits.</p> <p>I\u2019d love to hear from you: in your country, do you also sense a decline in readership, or perhaps a shift in the way people engage with books?
