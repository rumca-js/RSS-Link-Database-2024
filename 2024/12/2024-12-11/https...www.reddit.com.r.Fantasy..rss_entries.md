<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Personally, anytime a flashback pops up in a story, I roll my eyes because I&#39;m of the opinion that whatever you have in a flashback can be worked into the current story through dialog, action, and the like, reducing the bloat in a book as a result. I find flashbacks to be a lazy way of giving us many answers for very little work, leaving less intrigue and subtext in a character&#39;s actions. </p> <p>For instance, The Blade Itself does character work without flashback reliance very well, and I appreciate how our perception of character is not only affected by what they outwardly portray but also by what they <em>don&#39;t</em> portray. We want to know more about the characters.</p> <p>What do you think? Can flashbacks be used in a way that doesn&#39;t feel like they&#39;re DnD character sheets? What are some of your favorite/least favorite examples of flashbacks, and why? I&#39;d love to hear everyone&#39;s thoughts, as there&#39;s a surprising a

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I picked this up for no particular reason at all. I saw that Orbit has some new releases and so I just picked a few at random without even reading the description, I went purely off the cover.</p> <p>This was an easy world to get excited about. I liked the premise pretty much immediately. Our main character is a first time mom with a newborn that&#39;s a couple of months old. As the author mentions in her dedication, she&#39;s a mom, and I think she really nails the surreal feeling it is to be a parent for the first time. It&#39;s really difficult to nail the feeling because it&#39;s just so odd, I can&#39;t even really describe it and I&#39;ve been there done that. It&#39;s a mix of self identity crisis, insane hormones, strongly conflicting feelings that never seem to quite gel together, separate and different but equally strong feelings that pull you in two different directions. She really loves her work, she loves being a Hound and solving crimes

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Recently I&#39;ve been reading The Wandering Inn, and, after reading upto the beginning of book 5, I think I need a break. One thing I really like about TWI is how, in contrast to many similar stories, the main characters aren&#39;t just all powerful warriors/mages or whatever, but instead they take on &quot;more boring classes&quot; like innkeeper, runner, doctor, etc. (it&#39;s kind of a litrpg, so there&#39;s classes and stuff). What annoys me tho, is they still feel to heroic to me; I want the MC to just do whatever they want and explore magic, explore the world instead of playing the hero and saving it. But the main reason I&#39;ve stopped enjoying TWI as much is the sheer amount of side character POV chapters. Having a few such chapters sprinkled in every now and then is cool, but it&#39;s gotten so bad that getting a main chapter has become a rarity and I really just don&#39;t give a shit about 80% of the side chapters, so yeah...</p> <p>I don

Some older works of fantasy are eloquently wordy like that, especially REALLY old ones like pre-Tolkien. But the ones people mention such as Tolkien or Le Guin, actually have pretty simple prose. Doing simple prose effectively just isn’t as easy as it seems.</p> <p>Conversely some of the newer works are awfully bloated, even their fans acknowledge it. Bloated text doesn’t read a

With Alex Verus I couldn’t put the book down; they were fun, fast paced, but with a real emotional impact and weight to it (including the themes of injustice of wealth and power Jacka was not so subtly trying to convey in this book), where the consequences of Alex’s actions slowly piled up.

For the record, I have experienced romance in other mediums, namely in anime and visual novels, but this is the first time I am experiencing romance within novels. Though, as someone unfamiliar with romantasy as a whole, a lot of the terms, tropes, common ideas, and whatever else are essentially all alien to me. </p> <p>I ultimately chose The Mages of the Wheel because the way it was described piqued my interest. Yes, it leaned heavily into its romantic elements, but I heard it described as also having a fairly complex narrative with quite a few moving parts. It seemed like a good bridge from what I typically read; thus, I picked up it because I do want to branch out and

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’m challenging myself to do all classics this year, which has led me to finding some truly awesome books, but some squares are particularly difficult with this theme:</p> <p><strong>Published in 2020</strong>: My cheat for how to make a book published in 2024 a “classic”, is to have it be a retelling of a classic. So please tell me all your retelling recommendations this year! Even better if it’s a debut novel, but I’m giving up on hard mode this year for a few squares (looking at you, <em>Author of Color, Debut Novel in Last 5 Years</em>).</p> <p><strong>Self-Published/Indie Publisher</strong>: This one has also been a bit tricky because it’s hard to tell what exactly is self-published/indie given that I’m not very confident judging what books are self/indie published today, much less in the past.</p> <p><strong>Dreams</strong>: Looking for hardmode recommendations here, because this one is just impossible to determine from blurbs.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Just wondering if this is a common occurrence and if it gets better ? 😭 I’m not a big fantasy reader so I’m not used to this intense world building. I picked this up from the scifi section in Barnes &amp; Noble so that’s what I was expecting. I have zero fucking clue what’s going on and it’s somehow getting LESS clear as I read. I only read 67 pages, about to begin the 6th chapter, so I’m not far in. I’m just wondering when all of this stuff gets explained or when it’ll start to all come together. It’s been difficult to be immersed in this because I don’t fully understand what’s going on. </p> <p>As I was typing “I just wish there was a glossary of some sort” I decided to look in the BACK of the book instead of the front (in the few books I’ve read that have had some sort of glossary, it’s always been in the front) and turns out, there is one. It not being in the front of the book worries me a little though. I would think a glossary should be in the

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>As the title says, I am looking for a light and funny epic fantasy novel. I don’t care if it’s a series or a standalone novel. I have read the majority of every major epic fantasy novel over the last forty years. Christmas is extra stressful this year, and I need an escape. Not a fan of sci-fi, but love epic. Swords and dragons, not space and aliens.
