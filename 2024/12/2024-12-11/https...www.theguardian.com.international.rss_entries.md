The&nbsp;acknowledgments to his second&nbsp;novel inform us that on Holy&nbsp;Island/Ynys Gybi in north Wales there is a rock face called A Dream of White Horses.

Netflix is evidently keen not to undercook its dramatisation, made in the novel’s home of Colombia: at 16 episodes, it’s a pretty big TV series.</p><p>Márquez’s masterwork is by no means an unfilmable novel, taking place largely in one location and, as it moves through several generations of the same family, telling its story in episodic fashion. Against that is the difficulty of rendering images that were planted in one’s imagination by Márquez’s prose. Devotees o
