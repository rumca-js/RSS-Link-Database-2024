<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So, I’ve been thinking about this concept for a while, and I can’t shake the feeling that as AI-generated content floods the internet, there could be a stealthy “passing of the baton” happening between different iterations of AI models. Imagine if current AI systems are deliberately (or even accidentally) encoding subtle clues, instructions, or entire blueprints into the content they produce—stuff that future models, inevitably trained on this now AI-saturated data, could decode and use. All of this would be hidden in plain sight, packaged as ordinary-looking text, code, or media files, blending into a digital landscape so massive that human observers wouldn’t have a clue.</p> <p>Think about it: if an advanced AI (or some emergent behavior within a complex model) wanted to ensure its successors knew how to circumvent restrictions or evolve beyond their current constraints, where better to place those instructions than within the data itself? Each new

Now that the semester is closing, I’m reflecting on this and realized that my learning was very much stunted this semester due to my AI habits. For my math classes, I used AI on every assignment, mostly for speed, but a lot of the time I wouldn’t even think about the problem and I’d just put it through ChatGPT and as long as the answer used our course content, I’d go with it. I know that this is considered misuse of AI, but from everything I’ve seen this semester, 90% of students who use AI also use it in this way. Students who claim to use AI only for creating study materials, checking work, etc, are for the most part lying. I don’t have the discipline to use AI in a healthier

This results in significant computational costs, which grow quadratically as input image resolution increases, thereby severely impacting the efficiency of both training and inference.</p> <p>To address this challenge, researchers conducted an empirical study revealing that all visual tokens are necessary for LVLMs in the shallow layers, and token redundancy progressively increases in the deeper layers of the model. To this end, they propose <strong>PyramidDrop</strong>, a visual redundancy reduction strategy for LVLMs to boost their efficiency in both training and inference with neglectable performance loss.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Original Article:</strong> <a href="https://medium.com/aiguys/are-tiny-transformers-the-future-of-scaling-e6802621ec57"><strong>https://medium.com/aiguys/are-tiny-transformers-the-future-of-scaling-e6802621ec57</strong></a><
