<img src="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/INDY2-SITE.jpg?width=1920&height=1920&fit=bounds&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp" /> <p>On first boot, the PC version of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-developers-super-thrilled-its-headed-to-playstation">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> presents as a simply great PC release. Getting into the action, there's no shader compilation stutter and no obtrusive traversal stutter. It does require a graphics card with hardware-accelerated ray tracing and there is no fallback to a software alternative, but that's OK - performance is not a problem in this title.

I've spent the last half hour challenging the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tekken">Tekken</a> development chief to remember the first game's launch on the original PlayStation over the course of 1995, first in Japan, then in Europe and North America. I'm not used to my interviewees turning the tables on me. I'm meant to be the one asking the questions! But Harada, from behind his trademark sunglasses, has the same curiosity about the much-loved 32-bit generation that I have.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-playstation-propelled-tekken-into-the-big-time">Read more</a></p>
