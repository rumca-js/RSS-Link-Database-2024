<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Having left Inoreader I&#39;m trying alternatives, one of which is Feedbro extension. I&#39;ve set is to mimic my IR setup, which was tiles on a grid. This allowed me to add Youtube channels and see all new video previews in a similar way to YT, but only those I care for. On IR I could filter out #shorts with a Tampermonkey script, a function that was later replicated internally by IR (please note: NOT just videos with #shorts tag in the title, but ALL short videos, no matter the title). Now I see Feedbro has a Rules section, but I&#39;m not sure it can filter them out the same way. I&#39;ve tried to look for regex formulas online, but they were not compatible. Any idea if/how to do this?</p> <p>OR is there any workaround external to Feedbro that I could use like I did with Tampermonkey for IR?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/janaxhell"> /u/janaxhell </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.c
