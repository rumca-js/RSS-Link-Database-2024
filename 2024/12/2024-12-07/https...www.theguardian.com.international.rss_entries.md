<p>With insurgents closing in on Damscus, questions remain over whether the Assad regime will dig in, and if Hayat Tahrir al-Sham are as moderate as they seem</p><p>When Islamist militants swept into her home town of Aleppo little over a week ago, Rama Alhalabi sheltered indoors as fear engulfed her. Forces loyal to president Bashar al-Assad, who had sought to reassure residents that nothing was happening, suddenly deserted the city. But as the insurgency pushed south, rapidly seizing control of the city of Hama on the road to Damascus, Alhalabi’s fears about life under militia rule have slowly ebbed. Instead they have been replaced by fears that her friends in the army will be abandoned by their commanding officers as Assad’s regime loses its grip.</p><p>“People in Aleppo are feeling more comfortable now we’re further from the areas under the regime’s control,” said the 29-year-old, while still using a pseudonym in fear Assad could retake the city.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardi

The substitute Kevin Schade was found by Bryan Mbeumo just outside the area; his first touch took him clear of the defence, and his second sent the ball past Nick Pope.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/dec/07/brentford-newcastle-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The chef, author and broadcaster on the secret to plant-based cooking, what to eat – and how to name your livestock</p><p><strong>At home, we had a brilliant book</strong> called <em>The Times Cookery Book</em> by Katie Stewart. It must have come out in the early 1970s and I basically became the pastry chef for my mum’s dinner parties. I made chocolate mousses, chocolate rum gateaux, profiteroles, eclairs and genoise sponge in the summer with three, or even four, layers of cream, raspberries and cake. But it wasn’t <em>Bake Off</em>: I didn’t try and make it look like Vesuvius or something.</p><p><strong>I learned early on that it’s not a brilliant idea</strong> to name all the animals you’re planning to eat.

<p>Roll your eyes all you like at restaurants’ Christmas prices, but remember there are people giving up their day to cook for you</p><p>At Grantley Hall, a rural Yorkshire hotel so fancy they pipe jazz around the car park, there are various food offerings this Christmas Day. One of them, from the much-admired chef Shaun Rankin, is entitled the Taste of Home menu. It’s an interesting title, because it acknowledges something: that despite our growing comfort with paying others to cook for us, choosing to eat out on 25 December is still regarded as subversive and decadent. Christmas dinner is the one remaining domestic feast. It’s the one day of the year when we strap ourselves to the stove and cook a complex multistage meal, packed full of adored convention and cliche. And yet amazingly, some people choose to get out the credit card and leave the house.</p><p>So what is Rankin’s taste of home? It starts with sourdough, cultured butters and beef tea, continues through “scallop, celeria

A lot of people leave comments saying my videos remind them of their grandmothers. It makes my heart so full to read that.” White her

<p>That new British show you love? There’s a fair chance it is being backed by a US studio. What’s behind the Americans’ sudden influence over our TV – and will it mean more Ted Lassos, and fewer Only Fools and Horses?</p><p>My favourite TV show of 2024 couldn’t be any more British if it tried. Set in a City investment bank violently buffeted by an omnishambolic treasury, soundtracked by wry, maudlin 1980s UK synthpop (Simple Minds, Pet Shop Boys) and featuring a character named Sir Henry Muck, Industry scans British society, from strip clubs and tabloids to private members’ establishments and country piles. Every second pulses with a lightly worn, razor-sharp fluency in British class and culture that can only be the product of a lifetime studying its dynamics. But the funny thing is, Industry isn’t really British at all.</p><p>Perhaps that’s a bit harsh. After all, Industry is – obviously – filmed here in the UK, has a predominantly British cast and is written by two Britons; erstwh

<p>Flexible and festive, this granola is a lovely gift in a posh jar, and will keep for ages</p><p>After the recent birth of our baby girl, we were taken aback to receive so many delicious gifts from friends and neighbours. As I’m sure you know, postpartum nutrition is paramount for a healthy recovery, and all these meals and treats helped nourish my wife as she rested and rejuvenated. One of our favourite gifts was a huge jar of granola from our friend Majella, which was such a welcome addition to our pantry that we decided to make a batch of our own to give to friends and family this holiday season.</p><p>Granola is a fantastic way to use up overripe brown bananas, jar-ends (such as jam, crystallised honey and molasses), and short-date or excess store-cupboard ingredients such as oats, nuts, seeds, dried fruit, and spices.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/dec/07/how-to-make-granola-out-of-store-cupboard-staples-recipe-zero-waste-cooking">Continue reading...</a>
