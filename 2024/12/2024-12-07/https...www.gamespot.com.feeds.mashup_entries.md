<p>After years of rumors, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/">Fortnite</a>'s long-awaited first-person mode will finally debut in a few days with the launch of Fortnite Ballistic on December 11. Fortnite Ballistic is <em>not </em>a battle royale mode, but rather a 5v5 Counter-Strike-esque round-based shooter in which one team will attempt to set off a Rift Point Device bomb, while the other team will try to disarm it.</p><p>In Fortnite Ballistic, there aren't any respawns--the round ends when an entire team is eliminated, or the Rift Point Device is disarmed or exploded. You'll start each round with a pistol and some credits--you'll use the credits to buy guns between rounds, when each player also chooses a gadget, like bubble shields and proximity mines.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4411512-fortniteballistickeyart.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4411512" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="
