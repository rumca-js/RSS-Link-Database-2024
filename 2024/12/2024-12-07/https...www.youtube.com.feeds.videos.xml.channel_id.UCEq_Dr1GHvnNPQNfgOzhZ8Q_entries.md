Superman struggles to determine what to do when Lois Lane makes a move, as he's secretly been dating her as Clark Kent this whole time! And then the Russians invaded! And the world explodes, and Batman's all like "we need Spider-Man and that one peg legged guy from Peter Pan" and then everyone freaking dies but they come back and none of that happens. Jimmy Olsen shows up though that's neat!
