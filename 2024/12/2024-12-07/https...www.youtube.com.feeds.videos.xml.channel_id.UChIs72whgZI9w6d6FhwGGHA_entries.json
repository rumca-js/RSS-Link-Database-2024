Visit our store: https://store.gamersnexus.net/ - our fight against anti-consumer behavior is directly supported by audience support. We need your continued support to make these time-intensive, resource-intensive investigative videos featuring experts. Grab one of our project & soldering mats, our e-waste inductor dice and Snowflake the cat dice sets, PC building mats, and more.\nThis video dives into NZXT's response to our deep-dive investigation of what we think is a predatory, evil scam for rental computers.
