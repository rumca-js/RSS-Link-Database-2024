From 1920-1943, the children of JRR Tolkien received letters from Father Christmas, detailing his adventurous (and comedic) life at the North Pole.  In addition to Polar Bear hijinks and Christmas preparations, Father Christmas would reveal the dangers of the North Pole - particularly attacks by Goblins!
