I basically created account on it and it gave me about $15 worth of credit as a Free Trial.</p> <p>Upon registration a US number was given that I assumed would help me achieve my goal. During the initial setup they also provided a Python code snippet that had auth token and I think &#39;sid&#39; that would be enough for the credentials side. </p> <p>I code has also to and from numbers written and in the &quot;to&quot; I wrote my Twilio verified number which when I checked comes under the verified caller section of the Twilio portal.</p> <p>The issue I am facing:</p> <p>Every time I run the Python script it always gives back that the phone number is unverified. I searched but couldn&#39;t find solution so came here to take help from you guys. Please check python code and error.</p> <p>I am using twillo even though when creating account i verified my phone number ",
