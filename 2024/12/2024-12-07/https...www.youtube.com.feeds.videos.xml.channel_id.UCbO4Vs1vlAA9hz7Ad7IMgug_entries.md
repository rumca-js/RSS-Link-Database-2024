The Brutal & Cunning supplement for Kill Team 2024 provides a whole destructible 'playset' of terrain and a 'Codex' style book outlining the Ratlings and Wreckas in this new edition of Warhammer 40k's skirmish ruleset. Let's take a look at the Wrecka Orks kill team in the new box!

Thanks to Games Workshop for the complimentary advance copy of the Box to review.
