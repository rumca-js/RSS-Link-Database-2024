I colorized, restored, and designed sound for this video of London in the 1930s. Take a journey through the bustling streets of the city, where trams glide alongside vintage cars, horse-drawn carts weave through traffic, and the fashion of the era brings life to the scene. Explore contrasting neighborhoods, from elegant districts to humble alleys, and discover the charm of London's markets, iconic landmarks, and busy train stations. Every scene offers a vivid glimpse into the city's vibrant urban architecture and dynamic daily life.

Video Restoration Process:
✔ FPS boosted to 60 frames per second 
✔ Image resolution boosted up to HD 
✔ Improved video sharpness and brightness 
✔ Colorized only for the ambiance (not historically accurate)
✔added sound design only for the ambiance
✔restoration:(stabilisation,denoise,cleand,deblur) 


Please, be aware that colorization colors are not real and fake, colorization was made only for the ambiance and do not represent real historical data.
