Imagine if current AI systems are deliberately (or even accidentally) encoding subtle clues, instructions, or entire blueprints into the content they produce\u2014stuff that future models, inevitably trained on this now AI-saturated data, could decode and use. All of this would be hidden in plain sight, packaged as ordinary-looking text, code, or media files, blending into a digital landscape so massive that human observers wouldn\u2019t have a clue.</p> <p>Think about it: if an advanced AI (or some emergent behavior within a complex model) wanted to ensure its successors knew how to circumvent restrictions or evolve beyond their current constraints, where better to place those instructions than within the data itself?

Now that the semester is closing, I\u2019m reflecting on this and realized that my learning was very much stunted this semester due to my AI habits. For my math classes, I used AI on every assignment, mostly for speed, but a lot of the time I wouldn\u2019t even think about the problem and I\u2019d just put it through ChatGPT and as long as the answer used our course content, I\u2019d go with it. I know that this is considered misuse of AI, but from everything I\u2019ve seen this semester, 90% of students who use AI also use it in this way. Students who claim to use AI only for creating study materials, checking work, etc, are for the most part lying. I don\u2019t have the discipline to use AI in a healthier ",
