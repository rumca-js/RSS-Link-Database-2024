<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I seed from external HDDs because I care about capacity significantly more than speed, but I was just wondering at what point would the benefits from an SSD outweigh the extra capacity from a traditional drive? I&#39;m not concerned about the read speed of the drive, since I&#39;m almost always going to be bottlenecked by my upload speed. But the head of the drive obviously needs to seek in order to seed multiple files at the same time. I think my sector size is either a megabyte or half a megabyte. To put simply, I&#39;m just wondering where the cut off is. Like, would you have to seed 100+ torrents at the same time to actually get the benefits from an SSD?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/redditt1984"> /u/redditt1984 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1h8hw33/how_many_torrents_would_you_have_to_be_seeding_at/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.red
