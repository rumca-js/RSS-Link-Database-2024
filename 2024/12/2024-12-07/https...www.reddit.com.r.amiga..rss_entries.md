<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This one has been annoying me for a while now. Time wise I think it was around the same time as Strider but I could be wrong.</p> <p>My memory is that it took place in a forest-like setting and your character used a grapple of sorts to move between the sections - I think there were actual platform structures you could move to. </p> <p>I think you could use the grapple to attack enemies, both on the platforms but also holding onto the underside of them.</p> <p>I&#39;m uncertain if the character had an actual gun as well or if it was just the grapple.</p> <p>That is about all I can remember about it, other than I really liked it as wasn&#39;t all that good at it.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/MarauderDeuce"> /u/MarauderDeuce </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1h8rn8v/cannot_remember_the_games_name/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ami
