  <p id="0PFSJh">There’s a lot of <em>Star Trek: Discovery</em> in the official trailer for the <em>Star Trek: Section 31 </em>movie that Paramount Plus just released — big drama, explosions, and some looming threat that’s “unlike anything that Starfleet’s ever seen.” </p>
<p id="8Q833c">The trailer shows off a little more of the film, with moody corridors, some sort of electrified space ball, and brief looks at the spaceships that the show will feature. It also devotes more time to characters besides Michelle Yeoh’s Emperor Philippa Georgiou — namely Omari Hardwick’s Alok Sahar and Kacey Rohl’s

  <p id="R2gGRd">X has given Grok a new AI image generator model called “Aurora” that seems to create far more photorealistic imagery than Grok’s other image generator, with similarly few apparent restrictions on what it will produce, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/07/elon-musks-x-gains-a-new-image-generator-aurora/"><em>TechCrunch </em>reports</a>. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/6/24314860/x-grok-ai-chatbot-available-all-users">Like Grok</a>, anyone can use Aurora. It lives in a new “Grok 2 + Aurora beta” option in the Grok model selector, though you’ll only get a few queries before you hit the X Premium subscription paywall and have to wait.</p>
