He is a trouper and deserves a medal for this</p><p>For all those dreaming of a camp Christmas, here it surely comes: Mariah Meets Rylan. Our own Rylan Clark, the <em>nonpareil</em> of reality TV stars, Essex boy and the nation’s guncle (“gay uncle” for those of you who couldn’t place the vibe though you were warmed by it nonetheless) is brought into the orbit of the greatest star in the seasonal firmament, Mariah Carey; she of the five-octave voice, multiple music awards, feted singer and songwriter, seller of 220m records and counting and all-round extraordinary talent.</p><p>Rylan is thrilled. Mariah is … less so. They sit opposite each other in remarkably cheap-looking cream boucle armchairs for a notional fireside chat to mark the 30th anniversary of her mega hit All I Want for Christmas Is You.

<p>Art, sculpture and inspired colour palettes turn a home into the story of a life</p><p>Vanessa Branson lives in a mews house set back from a cobbled street. At one end is an old synagogue, at the other a Greek Orthodox cathedral, and beyond the little courtyard is a home that, as soon as you enter, feels like the most comfortable art gallery in the world. For all its rickety glamour, this house is significantly smaller than Branson’s previous home, a large townhouse in west London. “I have four kids who were all living with me with their partners, and then I had a friend who moved in for a long weekend and stayed for 32 years – there were 10 of us in the house,” she says, merrily adding that selling it was the only way to get them all to leave.</p><p>While her brother Richard was launching Virgin Records, in 1986 Branson opened a small contemporary art gallery in London’s Portobello Road.

Could the police intercept them in time?</p><p></p><p>Long before he started making guns with a 3D printer, Viljam Nyman was a kid who was bullied. In a document police later found on his computer, titled “The life story of how I became a far-right extremist”, Nyman described his childhood in Lahti, a city in southern Finland, being picked on by other kids and feeling abandoned by the adults around him. He wrote that this experience taught him something: “‘Be yourself’ or ‘don’t care’ were really bad pieces of advice. Violence and power, or the threat of using it, were actually the things that mattered. Equality and accepting difference were just words on paper, naive and idealistic fantasies. Human nature, in reality, was discriminatory and racist.”</p><p>In 2005, when Nyman was 11, violent protests broke out in a number of European countries after a Danish newspaper
