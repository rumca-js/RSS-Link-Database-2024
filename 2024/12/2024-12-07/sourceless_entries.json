While factors leading to the transitions between dynasties are a complex mixture of environmental, social and economic issues, the role of climate change has often been invoked as a significant factor in these geopolitical shifts. This is because China's reliance upon agriculture prior to the industrial era means the country was sensitive to abrupt changes in climate that could lead to a variety of social and economic impacts.",
