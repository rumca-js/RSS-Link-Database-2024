        "description": "<p>Based on Bram Stoker\u2019s Dracula and the silent cinema horror classic of the same name from 1922, Nosferatu is Robert Eggers\u2019 passion project that aims to create a modern horror classic based on the chilling vampire and gothic legend. Eggers brings his own unique style that fans of The Lighthouse, The Witch, and Northman will recognise and he soaks it in gothic dread as a brilliant cast bring the old story to life. Nosferatu feels like a horror throwback. From the very opening scene that portrays the link between Lily-Rose Depp\u2019s Ellen Hunter and Bill Skarsgard\u2019s Count Orlok, the film brings the fear and informs the audience that it will not be pulling any punches. This is a vampire tale with teeth fully bared and a world away from cool or sparkling vampires modern audiences may be used to. This vampire is a true monster \u2013 one to be feared not just with the well-designed jump scares but there is a slow-building tense sense of dread that fills the film and never seems to relent.
