<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m going to need you all to give The Practice, The Horizon and The Chain by Sofia Samatar a try. </p> <p>If you enjoy Octavia Butler, Philip K Dick, Margaret Atwood, Karen Lord, Anne Leckie, Hugh Howey, Becky Chambers, Jane Harpman. If you have ever worked in Academia. Then you should consider trying this book. For a literary SF book it is pretty accessible and readable. The prose is wonderful but economical and has a beautiful clarity to it. The subject matter is hard hitting and deeply political. </p> <p>I was immediately engaged, saw that it was quite inexpensive as an e-book, downloaded it and read the whole thing in one day. I did have to take breaks just to assimilate the emotional overload, but I couldn&#39;t stop reading it. I&#39;m not sure if it is my book of the year, but it certainly in the top three. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Indifferent_Jackdaw"> /u/Indifferent_Jackdaw <

## Book Club Etiquette?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I joined a book club a few months ago and every meeting people start referencing a previous book that was read and I have no idea what they&#39;re talking about. Another new person just joined and I could tell they were getting really annoyed by the other members spending nearly 10 minutes making comparisons to a book that the new member knew nothing about since it was the pick 3 months ago. I was actually there for that one but even I was getting annoyed because I came to discuss this month&#39;s read, not dive into the old book again. </p> <p>Is this normal for a book club? I think that it&#39;d be better etiquette to stay focused on the current read. It&#39;s difficult for new members to integrate in general, let alone when the conversation starts diverting somewhere they can&#39;t follow. The newest member and I bonded over this afterwards and she said she was on the fence about coming back because of this which I 100% understand.</p> <p>I&#39;m

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>First time poster, I generally read a series every week to two weeks depending on other tasks and felt like sharing so those wondering if they should grab that whole series at the bookstore or just the first book can make a more informed decision. </p> <p>The Riyria Revelations is a three book series following the thieving duo of Riyria; Royce and Hadrian. They are contracted for a job that turns their lives, and the world, upside down. Enjoy a twist on familiar fantasy themes, succinct but detailed combat sequences, and world building that rivals RR Martin and Anthony Ryan in scope if not detail. </p> <p>I don&#39;t like star reviews, because books deserve more than that. </p> <p>I rate this as a Good Read. The books are thick, detailed, and have just enough uniqueness to let them stand apart from the traditional fantasy fare. </p> <p>The plot was convoluted but tied up nicely with several twists that caught me off guard.

I&#39;m sure a lot of people would disagree with that, but I&#39;m in my first year of grad school and intend to continue in academia as a queer person; the thought of being absolutely screwed by department politics and the vindictiveness of those with more social power is horrifying. I think I&#39;m going to have to take a step away from it again.</p> <p>I&#39;ve been struggling with depression for about a year and a half now, and it&#39;s made it difficult for literature to get me to feel anything.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>My picks:</p> <p>I‚Äôve read 2 books by Bret Easton Ellis,‚Äî The Shards and Lunar Park‚Äî and they both made me wish I could‚Äôve read them with a book club or something because they‚Äôre so fascinating. His ‚Äúautofiction‚Äù approach is something that I don‚Äôt see done almost ever and it adds a whole new layer of intrigue onto everything he touches. Not a fan of him as a person but I love his books. </p> <p>Mason &amp; Dixon by Thomas Pynchon. This book is an epic, sprawling adventure with an entire fan wiki dedicated to the historical references contained within it. The only book I‚Äôve ever annotated of my own free will. Unexpectedly, though, I think about it constantly not because its crazy plot but because it is deeply, deeply beautiful and moving. I never would‚Äôve thought a silly little book about the two guys who drew the boundaries between states would have this profound of an emotional impact on me. I was MOVED!!!!!!!!
