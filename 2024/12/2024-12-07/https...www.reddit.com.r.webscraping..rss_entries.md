<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I want to hire someone to find the email/phone number associated with a public social media account that is defaming me with my full name/photos, but I&#39;m not sure what kind of language to employ in the job direction. Is this scraping? How can this task be described from a professional standpoint to attract someone with the right skillset?</p> <p>For more info, I want this to be as legit as possible because I have cause to think I know this person IRL and want to take legal action. Any help is appreciated! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/vampirebunnie"> /u/vampirebunnie </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1h8znpv/is_this_scraping/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1h8znpv/is_this_scraping/">[comments]</a></span>
