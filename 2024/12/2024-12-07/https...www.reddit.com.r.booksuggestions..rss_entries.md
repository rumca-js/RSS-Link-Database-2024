<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all. First time poster. I read a lot of webtoons and I&#39;m so obsessed with the reincarnation/ isekai genre. For those who dont know it typically goes like MC dies at the hands of someone trusted and gets reincarnated back in time with enough time to change the outcome of their life. There are lots of variations of that premise. Anyways I&#39;d like to find a full book version of this genre instead of graphic novel/ comics. What genre should I be looking for? Any book recs?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/mccheeseit"> /u/mccheeseit </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1h954cp/isekai_books/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1h954cp/isekai_books/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>It’s common knowledge in those circles that band formed because the frontman Gerard Way was on his way to work in NYC when the towers fell, making him quit his job and form the band. Their first album is emo as hell and captures a lot of feelings about the tragedy, especially the song “Skylines and Turnstiles”. Are there any books like it? Fiction or Non-Fiction but preferably more of a memoir and less of a history lesson.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I graduated college last year, but I feel so far from where I thought I’d be, both in life and as a person. I’m stuck in this cycle of regret and self-blame, constantly angry at myself for letting insecurities and fear of failure hold me back. Even when I do achieve something, it’s like I can’t give myself permission to feel proud—I just end up feeling unworthy or like it wasn’t enough.</p> <p>Seeing people I grew up with thriving in their careers or personal lives just makes it harder. It’s like I’m standing still while everyone else is moving forward. And honestly, the loneliness is crushing. I want to reach out and build connections, but I feel so awkward and unsure of how to start.</p> <p>If anyone else has been through something similar, how did you begin to break out of this? An book recommendations, advice or words of encouragement would mean a lot.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Watcher2

Bonus if it has a pleasant cover with a period appropriate picture of some sort.</p> <p>Was considering the Penguin Classics but can&#39;t find confirmation if it&#39;s unabridged (I imagine so at 1000+ pages but want to be sure). I was kind of surprised I couldn&#39;t seem to find Oxford or Cambridge University press versions, I figured they&#39;d both have his works available. Not sure what other publishers are good to look at for classic works.

He recently saw me reading from my kindle paperwhite and mentioned &quot;you know, I really think I&#39;d read more if I had something that convenient&quot; so what are some suggestions I can get loaded onto it initially that may pique his interest and get him hooked to read more often (and make the kindle purchase worthwhile, lol)? He&#39;s a big history buff, and I think mystery or mystery/suspense would likely appeal to him, too. I would initially prefer shorter &quot;more-ish&quot; suggestions that have an addictive quality. Series suggestions would be great, too!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/dogtordogb"> /u/dogtordogb </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1h8jm4l/bought_a_kindle_for_dads_birthday_what_books_do/">[li
