It's almost difficult to believe that Blizzard's Overwatch series has survived this long, even spawning a "sequel." However, between all the annoying changes, both balance and otherwise, there's been a clamor for something more, and wouldn't you believe that a game with actual superheroes would deliver it?

Marvel Rivals is a hero shooter in much the same vein, with 33 heroes across three roles. Almost every big name is here, from Wolverine and Captain America to Magneto and Venom, spectacularly designed and playing exceptionally well. Though the number of maps and modes isn't all that high, the action remains dynamic throughout, especially with all the potential compositions and the Team-Up Attacks.

There are other nitpicks, like the lack of "free" cosmetics and the lack of a role queue, but overall, Marvel Rivals is a fantastic title that competes with - and even surpasses - Overwatch 2 in numerous ways.

Uncharted did a spectacular job of delivering cinematic, bombastic, globetrotting treasure hunting adventures in the vein of Indiana Jones, so much so, in fact, that for years, most of us have taken for granted any future Indiana Jones game ironically serving as an Uncharted clone. 

MachineGames, however, has decided to march to the beat of its own drum with Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, and we couldn’t be happier about that fact. Uncharted is excellent, of course, but The Great Circle feels entirely unique, delivering a first person adventure experience that emphasizes exploration, puzzles, stealth, and semi-open world design with strong immersive sim elements. 

That’s not exactly what many had in mind for a AAA Indiana Jones game, but The Great Circle captures the adventure vibe of the IP perfectly, and does it its own way.

After years of anticipation, Path of Exile 2 is now available. For some players, the wait would be slightly longer than expected due to servers buckling under the weight of so many. Nevertheless, the action RPG peaked at over 459,000 concurrent players on Steam on its first day despite being in early access.

There were also over 1.1 million people watching the game on Twitch. While the first game has always been fairly regarded, with a dedicated community, these numbers are unprecedented. Of course, much of that popularity has to do with just how addictive the game is. The new campaign and its Acts, and the quality-of-life changes are all good.

However, Path of Exile 2's structure and overall progression push you to unlock the next big Passive Tree point, the next gear upgrade, and more. The incredible combat provides a satisfying feedback loop as you continue clicking away.
