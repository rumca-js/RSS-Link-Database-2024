<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello there!</p> <p>Yesterday, I&#39;ve asked you for your favorite movie set in Spain. It&#39;s interesting, because more than 100 comments later, in a way, we have a &quot;fpreign-but-not-so-foreign&quot; winner here: Internationally, <strong><em>El labertino del fauno</em></strong> (engl.: <em>Pan&#39;s Labyrinth)</em> is likely to be the best-known film on our list so far.</p> <p>But <a href="https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/">our official letterboxd list </a>immediately calls for the next movie. We now move on to the next euorpean country with S, namely <strong>Sweden</strong>. Just like yesterday, there are only two rules to follow today:</p> <ul> <li>It&#39;s about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it&#39;s important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, tha

## "Hammering the door shut" in The Hateful Eight is one of my all time favorite bits in any movie. Any other movies with comedic bits as a side story that get more ridiculous as the movies goes on?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Recently watched The Hateful Eight for the 3rd time now and one of my favorite comedic bits of all time is everyone trying to hammer the door shut while getting into Minnie&#39;s haberdashery.</p> <p>It just gets more and more chaotic and silly as the movie goes on. First Kurt Russell&#39;s character struggling to keep the door shut while being handcuffed to his prisoner and getting yelled at by random strangers. Then Walton Goggins character goes through the same thing 20 minutes later, the massive struggle of one board not being strong enough to hold, everyone staring at them judging and shouting to really nail it in. OB accidentally hits the wooden board instead of the nail and saying &quot;jesus christ, that door is a son of a whore&quot; as the wooden board breaks in two. Then 15 minutes later the mexican character hitting his head against the lamp while trying to nail the door for the third time now and we see how fucked up the door boards are

I feel like a lot of the criticism of his ability comes from people who have only seen Morbius and Suicide Squad</p> <p>But it’s well known that he seems like a huge pain in the ass. His method thing seems really annoying for his costars, and also just wastes a lot of time. Leto seems to have a lot of confidence in his formula, not realizing most of the roles that made him famous were just relatively normal dudes. Now he wants to prove himself as some kind of “eccentric method genius!”</p> <p>After a while, why would producers and directors still want to pick him up? Especially if his movies haven’t been very successful recently.</p> <p>Also, I know David Ayer seemed to like his weird process, which I suppose makes sense considering Ayer got along with Shia Labeouf very well. However, what I find funny is when you look at the behind the scenes for the Suicide Squad, the cast se

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Ever since the assassination of the United Health Care CEO this past week, I haven&#39;t been able to get this movie out of my mind and I saw it many years ago. It&#39;s about a guy whose wife gets sick, their health insurance reaches their limit and he tries to cash in on his pension from the military, but most of it was put into stocks and this film&#39;s setting was the 2008-2009 Wall Street crash. The wife feels guilty, commits suicide and the husband goes off the edge and starts going on a killing spree against stock brokers and CEOs. </p> <p>It&#39;s directed by Uwe Boll (Of course, yes, that Uwe Boll) but as far as his movies go, I don&#39;t remember this one being half bad. I remember Dominic Purcell from Prison Break as the husband and John Heard as the main antagonist. I see it&#39;s on Tubi, I might rewatch it this weekend.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/jblanch3"> /u/jblanch3 </a> <b

It’s understandable to think that he’s just going to fall back into the same workaholic lifestyle after the movies conclusion. Meanwhile Myron’s plight, akin to an Amazon worker, is way more relatable. He’s had to work crazy hours, probably doesn’t get compensated enough, and desperately is trying to do whatever he can to do what he can for his kid. Even Ted, if you can ignore his cartoonishly devilish intentions, is just a neighborhood single father doing everything he can for his kid (trying to bang a married woman notwithstanding). </p> <p>I enjoyed this movie as a kid and it still brings back fond memories.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/KiLLaHMoFo"> /u/KiLLaHMoFo </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.c

My roommate worked there for quite a while.</p> <p>Except for switching to digital projection around 2005, it never really got updated, though. Carmike went under. Most of their other theaters were closed, but this one sold to AMC in 2016. They never did anything with it, either. They just kept showing movies as it slowly decayed. It was an AMC Classic where evening tickets for new releases were only $8 &amp; the only theater on the south side of town, but business slowly dropped off.
