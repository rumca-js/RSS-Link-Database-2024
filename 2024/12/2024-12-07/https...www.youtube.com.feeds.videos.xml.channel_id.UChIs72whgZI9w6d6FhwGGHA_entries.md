This video dives into NZXT's response to our deep-dive investigation of what we think is a predatory, evil scam for rental computers. NZXT's "Flex" subscription computer program is untenable not just in cost, but in additional requirements. Further, its advertising is now admitted as being incorrect by NZXT itself. We respond to the company's statement, which it took several days to write, calling consumers "confused."
