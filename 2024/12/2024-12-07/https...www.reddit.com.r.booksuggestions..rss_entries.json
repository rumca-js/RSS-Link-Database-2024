There are lots of variations of that premise. Anyways I&#39;d like to find a full book version of this genre instead of graphic novel/ comics. What genre should I be looking for?

Bonus if it has a pleasant cover with a period appropriate picture of some sort.</p> <p>Was considering the Penguin Classics but can&#39;t find confirmation if it&#39;s unabridged (I imagine so at 1000+ pages but want to be sure). I was kind of surprised I couldn&#39;t seem to find Oxford or Cambridge University press versions, I figured they&#39;d both have his works available.

I\u2019ve read The Blade Itself series as well as The Prince of Thorns series, they were great and right along the lines of what I seem to enjoy. I would love to find a book similar to these vibes but maybe places in a more urban \u201ccurrent\u201d time frame and not so much knights and swords..

Also one of their rivals has a son who meets the daughter, like they&#39;re 6-7, and asks if his dad is she&#39;s his. Now I know the author was writing pieces of their story once they got older on patreon but now I can&#39;t find it anywhere. Not in my reading history not anywhere.
