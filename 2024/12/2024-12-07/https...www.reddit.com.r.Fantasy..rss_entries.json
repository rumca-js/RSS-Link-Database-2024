I don\u2019t always love political stuff, but this book was so well written and the world so well crafted I got super into it. I think the main thing was that Maia was such an amazing character and I was rooting for him almost from the get go. I would put it in the same category as Uprooted by Naomi Novik in that I loved the main character from the onset and I was super invested in their arc.

I&#39;m a huge Travis Baldree fan, but I&#39;ve noticed something interesting: after listening to so many of his narrations, his voice now reminds me of characters from other books he&#39;s narrated, which sometimes pulls me out of the current story. Anyone else experience this with their favorite narrators?

I feel like ever since I picked up Powerless (which I hated), I have DNFed every fantasy. I loved six of crows, poppy war, a darker shade of magic, and the cruel prince (although faeries are not my thing). I also LOVE the winners curse series (even though it&#39;s not really fantasy). I also read The Way of Kings and enjoyed it, but it was a lot and I think I prefer books in the 400 page range. However, I just feel like every fantasy I&#39;ve picked up has an idiot moron FMC and a predictable plot and a boring love interest. I want something plot driven with a side slowburn romance. Also preferably good writing (I swear to god I have no idea how some of these books got published). I want to be sucked into the world, yk?

I also love lore and legends\u2014the more, the better! I\u2019d like a short series (no more than four books) that isn\u2019t finished yet or leaves some mysteries unresolved.</p> <p>(Also, I\u2019m French, so nothing too recent or obscure, as it might not have a French translation.)</p> <p>Any recommendations?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/arabacadabra\"> /u/arabacadabra </a> <br/> <span>",
