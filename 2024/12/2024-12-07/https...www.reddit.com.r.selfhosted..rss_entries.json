I&#39;m having some issues with setting up my Postfix &amp; Dovecot SMTPS IMAPS server - I remeber this being a pain to setup back in the day but haven&#39;t been able to find the same sites I used.</p> <p>At the moment, I can login to the server and access my inbox using IMAPS and send emails to email accounts on other hosts. However, I am unable to recieve emails from other servers. I have tried to debug this issue the best I can, however I cannot seem to find an answer.</p> <p>Common issues:</p> <p>Is the port open? Ports 25, 465, 993 are open in UFW and through my hosting companies firewall.</p> <p>Is Postfix/Dovecot listening on WAN IP? Both services are listening to the universal inteface (0.0.0.0)</p> <p>From the logs, I believe it may be an issue with the server SSL, this can be found in <code>/var/log/mail.log</code></p> <p><code>2024-12-07",

Ranging from stable internet which can provide enough bandwidth for about 8 devices( I live in rural part if India with not so good fibre connection). Also I need to create a storage setup which would backup as storage for all the devices and also should be able to provide online access(not looking for regular cloud services like AWS or google one). Maybe some NAS options if available commercially. Third is I need home wide distribution so suggestions for better router network is most welcome. Any suggestions would be helpful.

So far I&#39;ve setup ssh login with keys, disabled password logins, implemented fail2ban though it took a while because of debian. And setup ufw with only port 22 opened.</p> <p>Now I&#39;m trying to wrap my head around hostname, dsn settings and reverse proxy, and quite honestly I&#39;m lost. Is there a guide, any book, or tutorials that could paint the picture from the very basics. Like I&#39;m still confused about the differences between hostname and domain name and dsn server. I tried watching Shawn Powers <a href=\"https://youtu.be/WMy3OzvBWc0\">Linux Server Course</a> but it&#39;s pretty overwhelming for a noobie. </p> <p>Thanks in advance.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Mrleibniz\"> /u/Mrleibniz </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1h8g5pu/any_resour",
