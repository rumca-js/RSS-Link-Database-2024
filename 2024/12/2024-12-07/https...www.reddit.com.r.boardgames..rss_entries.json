As far as I can tell even if you need to go down on multiple levels that you don&#39;t have, everyone still only loses one wound total. But I watched the watch it played video rules and he said you lose one wound for every level of thing that you can&#39;t go down, so if you need to go down on the palisade two levels everyone loses two wounds. </p> <p>But then when you are discarding determination tokens in the morale phase you do suffer for each token that you are unable to discard.

Resources were based on where you were in the map, questing and relic hunting used a deck of cards like the search mechanic in Endure The Stars. Building let you get bonuses for yourself in the territory you claimed, as well",

I remember playing a game awhile ago that I\u2019d like to find again, but I can\u2019t find it after a lot of searching. Here\u2019s what I remember about the game:</p> <p>There was a space/alien theme where stranded crew members had to hide from an alien hunting them. </p> <p>In order to hide, the crew players chose one of ten locations to hide in by playing cards. Everyone started with the first five location cards, and could earn the other five through bonuses on the first five cards. I remember the cards having nice designs. Each location had special effects for the hiding player to use. </p> <p>The alien player would put a chip on one of the ten locations, and would move ahead on a path if they caught someone. The players had 3 (?) lives. </p> <p>Please let me know if anyone knows what this game is called! Thank you for your help!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/se",
