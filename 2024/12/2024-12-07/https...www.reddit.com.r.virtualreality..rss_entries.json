I&#39;m an english teacher in the North of France, and sadly, our school doesn&#39;t have the money needed for a school trip for our ESL students. So, as I love experimenting, I wondered if there are any possibilities, with a VR devise, to &quot;simulate&quot; a trip any english-speaking country. It won&#39;t have the same impact that a Real school trip, but well... I&#39;m thinking about filling forms to possible get some VR headsets for our school, so that&#39;s why I&#39;m here.
