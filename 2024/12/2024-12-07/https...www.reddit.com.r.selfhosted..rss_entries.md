<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all,</p> <p>I recently had to reset my VPS server and have begun the process of setting it back up. I&#39;m having some issues with setting up my Postfix &amp; Dovecot SMTPS IMAPS server - I remeber this being a pain to setup back in the day but haven&#39;t been able to find the same sites I used.</p> <p>At the moment, I can login to the server and access my inbox using IMAPS and send emails to email accounts on other hosts. However, I am unable to recieve emails from other servers. I have tried to debug this issue the best I can, however I cannot seem to find an answer.</p> <p>Common issues:</p> <p>Is the port open? Ports 25, 465, 993 are open in UFW and through my hosting companies firewall.</p> <p>Is Postfix/Dovecot listening on WAN IP? Both services are listening to the universal inteface (0.0.0.0)</p> <p>From the logs, I believe it may be an issue with the server SSL, this can be found in <code>/var/log/mail.log</code></p> <p><code>2024-12-07

Right now when I play something on Jellyfin, I can see the image quality is not the same as if I had play it locally, as there are some compression artefacts despite setting it on maximum quality/bitrate. So is there any way to stream &quot;raw&quot; files on Jellyfin?</p> <p>Also, it seems I can&#39; t use the Jellyfin&#39;s apps, I tried to install the windows desktop one, but I can&#39;t connect to my server.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>A friend of mine&#39;s a big Linus fan and came across HexOS (maybe I can finally convince him to selfhost :D), and of specific interest to me was the buddy backup feature. The feature allows users to share an encrypted datastore across the internet to store an offsite backup on their friends HexOS system, and vice versa. Pretty cool.</p> <p>Whether this will mature into something that allows delta or block changes, only time will tell. The downsides to it is 1) that its a paid product and both yourself and your friend need to have a paid licence, and 2) at least for me - that its based on TrueNAS. I already have everything running on proxmox and docker, and I really don&#39;t want to change everything just to get the backup solution I&#39;ve been wanting.</p> <p>So the question arises - is there already a solution like this in FOSS that I just haven&#39;t come across yet?

Due to the security concerns around this I&#39;d like to set it up where it rejects HTTP and only uses HTTPS. </p> <p>I tried using my Google skills to find a guide but they were sadly lacking, and I&#39;m not sure where to begin besides this post.</p> <p>TIA!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/FlyingHick987"> /u/FlyingHick987 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1h8xq9g/tandoor_https_access/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1h8xq9g/tandoor_https_access/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>After reading several posts about SearXNG and listening about it in podcasts and YouTube, I got convinced to give it a try. For several reasons I decided not to self-host it, but I was fascinated by the number of engines and the flexibility it supports. </p> <p>I self-host a number of services that I use almost daily: gitea, paperless-ngx, immich, NextCloud, mealie and WikiJS. Many of them come with an API that allows you to query them programmatically and are well documented.</p> <p>I know that SearXNG already has a gitea engine which you can point to your internal instance. Are there any other engines out there that would do the same with other self hosted services, like immich or paperless-ngx? It would be great to be able to search our own documents, images, recipes, and/or documentation through a centralized point like SearXNG.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Wereldzoeker"> /u/Wereldzoeker <

If so why did you do it? </p> <p>My biggest gripe with plex right now is the subtitles. My wife is Chinese and likes to have mandarin subtitles enabled on everything we watch, but it&#39;s kind of hit or miss with plex. Sometimes the subtitles end up being for a completely different title, or are out of sync, requiring fiddling as we watch the movie, or start in sync but gradually become out of sync. They also do not download automatically, which means when watching a TV series, I have to do it for every episode. </p> <p>Would Jellyfin provide a better experience for my use case? </p> <p>Thank you </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32;

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone. I&#39;ve had this jellyfin server for almost a month, and everything has been running smoothly up until now.</p> <p>I&#39;ve noticed that whenever I upload a new file to my movies folder, it just won&#39;t get recognized. This used to happen with some, but not all files, and it was easily fixable. Now manual identification doesn&#39;t work anymore, as jellyfin can &quot;spot&quot; the actual movie on TMDB but it won&#39;t download any data from them. Also, all the movies I had previously imported seem to have become &quot;hollow&quot;, in a sense that I can still watch them and read their description but all the posters and backdrops I downloaded have vanished into thin air. Some people suggested checking if metedata trackers were still on, and yes they are. </p> <p>What would you do in that situation?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Sa-_-m"> /u/Sa-_-m </a> <br/> <span><a href="https

I&#39;m hoping you all might have some good recommendations!</p> <p>I really like ClickUp&#39;s features, but sometimes I need to work with large teams, and the per-user pricing quickly adds up. What I value most in a tool:</p> <p>Ability to create task lists and view them in a Kanban board organized by status.</p> <p>Features like &quot;chatting&quot; inside notes, tagging team members, and collaboration.</p> <p>Custom fields are essential for my workflow.</p> <p>The free version of ClickUp doesn&#39;t support custom fields, which is a dealbreaker for me.</p> <p>Here’s what I’ve tried so far:</p> <ol> <li><p>Vikunja: Almost perfect, but it lacks custom fields.</p></li> <li><p>NocoDB: Great as a CRM (I use it for a client), but it feels awkward as a project management tool.</p></l
