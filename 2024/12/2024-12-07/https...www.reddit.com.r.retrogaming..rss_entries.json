Now that I have kids of my own, I love dragging them away from Fortnite and Forza to play some proper games! I have Retroarch with FB Neo core on a Shield Pro, with repurposed PS5 controllers. My sons current favourite is Golden Axe, my daughter enjoys kicking my ass in MK3, and we all love a 3 player bout on The Simpsons and Dynamite Dux. </p> <p>Anyone else getting their kids into retro games?
