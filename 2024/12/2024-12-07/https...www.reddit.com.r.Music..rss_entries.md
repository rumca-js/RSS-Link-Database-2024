I bought it, got the confirmation, the receipt, and the ticket. I get to the concert venue, my ticket scans perfectly fine, I find my seat, and I sit down.</p> <p>I leave my seat for about 20 minutes to go use the bathroom and eat some food before the show starts, I come back to my seat and sit down and start talking to other people in my row. Then, all of a sudden, a girl walks up to me really nicely and tells me that I’m sitting in HER seat. I laughed at first and I gave her a weird look and I was like, “wait, I’m pretty sure this is MY seat.” She shows me her ticket information and I started panicking because I actually thought I might’ve been in the wrong seat. But then I pull up my ticket information and it’s there as clear as fucking day that we both have the SAME exact ticket. Same section, row, number. Come to find out that

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>It kinda irks me when people are praising artists for their songwriting and production, yet had a whole team behind each and every song. I don&#39;t know the amount of input the creator puts towards their music but when I see a song with 5+ writers and multiple producers I can&#39;t but wonder if the artist could be replaced by any other person (example: Glimpse of Us by Joji). I&#39;ll look at someone like Post Malone (who I like) and I see his DEBUT album had more credits than a damn movie. It&#39;s why it&#39;s honestly so impressive to me that someone like Billie Eyelash is one of the most popular artists whilst only being helped by her brother in producing her music. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/yeetTheReee"> /u/yeetTheReee </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1h90lu4/at_what_point_is_it_where_its_not_the_artist/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https:

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I often ponder this question because usually whenever it&#39;s asked, it&#39;s either exclusively in hip-hop circles, or excluding hip-hop circles. To be fair, a lot of people have limited perspectives when it comes to the musical genres they listen to and usually tend to be insular in communities that listen to the same genres they do, but I want to try asking a more diverse group of people, who do you guys consider the best lyricist of all time and why? Personally, I would vote Brownsville Ka, because I think he has mastered the art of being succinct. He has the ability to stack multiple entendres, layered rhyme schemes, and introspective themes in bars such as &quot;This is mastery, almost at capacity Take God&#39;s name in vain, don&#39;t blame if they can&#39;t blast for me Of course, them thugs are who I love and never ask a fee Must admit it&#39;s some vicious pictures in this tapestry&quot;</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32;

But despite that, everyone was their own opinions, and your opinion might get you hate, but it&#39;s only a opinion. So what is your unpopular music opinion?
