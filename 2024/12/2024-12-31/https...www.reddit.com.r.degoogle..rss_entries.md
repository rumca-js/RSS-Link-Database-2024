My older phone had the possibility to record call (in Canada is totally legal under the federal law, if one of the participant during the call know that a record is made, in this case, I will know it).</p> <p>So, if someone have an idea, a link or something like that, I&#39;m all here to listen to you.</p> <p>Thank you</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Any-Board-6631"> /u/Any-Board-6631 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/degoogle/comments/1hqlbji/which_dialer_on_a_recent_android_phone_11_without/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/degoogle/comments/1hqlbji/which_dialer_on_a_recent_android_phone_11_without/"
