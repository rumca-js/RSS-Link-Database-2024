They were a branch of Penguin launched in 2002 mostly devoted to reprinting mass market paperback editions of popular (and usually out of print at that time) fantasy novels and series for young adults. Some of the ones I read and loved through this line were The Firebringer Trilogy by Meredith Ann Pierce, I Am Morgan le Fay by Nancy Springer, and Crown Duel by Sherwood Smith. They also reprinted a bunch of the Redwall books and things by authors like Robin McKinley and Patricia McKillip.</p> <p>To deal with stress this year I&#39;ve found myself revisiting my childhood fantasy favorites and getting around to series I never tried back then, and I really miss having a devoted imprint that worked to make out of print books accessible again and at affordable prices.

I didn\u2019t actually set out to read this much, it just kind of happened. Overall, I read way more great books this year than last so I\u2019m really happy. I read 21 Physical books, 16 Ebooks, and 15 Audiobooks. Of these, 23 were Science Fiction, 12 were Fantasy, 5 were Self-Improvement, 4 were Thrillers, 3 were Memoirs, 2 were \u2018Classics\u2019 and 1 each of General Non-fiction, Alternate History and Historical Fiction. 7 of the Science Fiction books were Star Trek novels, I was on a bit of a Star Trek kick at the beginning of the year. 5 of the Fantasy novels were Dresden File books and 3 were Stormlight Archive books.</p> <p>9 of these were re-read (or re-listens), which is more than I normally re-read but I found that re-reads are the best way for me to break out of a reading slump.

Spoilers for the first law below. </p> <p>To elaborate, I loved The First Law but hated the ending. It got me back into reading after a long break, I found myself actually excited to read the books, I was engaged with all the characters, and all that gushy stuff. The ending really bothered me, though. I don&#39;t read fantasy to be realistic -- I read it because I know how it will end, and this one caught me off guard in a bad way. It bothers me that none of the characters got any semblance of a happy ending (except Glotka, for some god forsaken reason), but it bothers me more how open ended it was, and how Byzaz just gets away with everything. It seemed like there was no real conclusion. I",

The only thing I reeeaally remember about the book is that the world tends to be seen in shades of grey because the the magical abilities there are fueled by color and the people who can use it literally suck the color out of things. If it helps, the book was pretty thick with pages. If nobody knows what I\u2019m talking about, thanks anyways.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Icy-Procedure8313\"> /u/Icy-Procedure8313 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1hq2s4t/looking_for_a_book_i_read_once/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1hq2s4t/looking_for_a_book_i_read_once/\">[comments]</a></span>",
