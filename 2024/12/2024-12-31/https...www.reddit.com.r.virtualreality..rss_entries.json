It was pre order and I was expecting a long delivery time, I am not in a hurry, just want to play a bit with a VR. Now they told me .it would take another 3 weeks until it is delivered, I am kind of loosig hope here as 2 days after I placed my order the price went to 700 euro and now 1300 euro.</p> <p>My main purpose is to watch movies in VR rooms, 3D, etc something more immersivr than my 65&#39; VA QLed panel tv. </p> <p>Which vr headset gives nice black color reproduction in movies when I am watching in cinema rooms, etc? Is it still worth Q Pro or PSVR2 , P4 Ultra or maybe Q3 will be able to offer the colors and constrast that Q Pro has? That was the main reason I fomo ed in that 500 euro deal on umbound xr.</p> <p>These days all headseats mentioned in this topic are in the same price range, except PSVR2.</p> <p>Many thanks for your sug",
