I often struggle to recall the plot of a book after finishing it, so I\u2019ve been making an effort to take notes to stay focused and not let my ADHD interfere. This also aids my memory, especially when a book is part of a series and I read the last installment years ago. Goodnotes introduced an AI feature a while back that has significantly enhanced the usefulness of my notes. It can even interpret my poor handwriting. I was particularly impressed by its ability to infer details that I jot down but don\u2019t explicitly state, such as character motives and underlying themes.

I\u2019ve read a 100 pages of this book and I just don\u2019t understand? I LOVE weird fiction and am all for weird/taboo topics in books but it just feels like all of these plot lines are hitting a wall! I know many people are big on his writing and his other works and I figured I\u2019d give it a shot. However, I am just curious if the book improves or maybe I should find a better read? I also own fight club by him and I really wanted to read it this year, so I wanted to know if choke was just a weak case of his writing or if this is how all his books are! If there is something I\u2019m not getting about this book please enlighten me because I would love to listen!!
