<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>One of the biggest risks with AI is confusing what we hope it can do with what it actually can do. Aspirations drive progress, but treating them as current reality sets us up for problems. For instance, people often assume generative AI like ChatGPT understands language like humans, but it’s just predicting text patterns. In healthcare, premature adoption of AI tools based on lofty promises has led to misdiagnoses. The same issues appear in areas like military tech, where autonomous systems are pushed forward despite unresolved ethical and technical concerns.</p> <p>Overhyped marketing and media exaggeration fuel these misunderstandings, and people often assign AI human-like traits it doesn’t have. Unrealistic expectations can lead to poor decisions, like overtrusting flawed systems in hiring or law enforcement, or creating policies based on capabilities AI lacks. When these systems fail to deliver, trust erodes and progress stalls.</p> <p>To avoid t
