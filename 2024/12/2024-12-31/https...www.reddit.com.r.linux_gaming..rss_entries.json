Specifically, while playing games, the FPS seemed to affect my mouse cursor. I have a 165Hz monitor, and it was frustrating in games where cursor precision and smoothness matter, like World of Warcraft or Path of Exile.</p> <p>Whenever my FPS dropped to 60, the cursor would also look like it was running at 60Hz, which was extremely jarring and not smooth at all. I spent a long time trying to fix this (VRR/Freesync was disabled), but nothing worked. I also tried to get some help in google/discord servers but seems like im the only one complaining lol.</p> <p>Switching to X11 wasn\u2019t an option either, because it doesn\u2019t properly handle mixed refresh rate setups. I have a 165Hz primary monitor and a 60Hz secondary monitor, and on X11, this setup forces both monitors to 60Hz, which is unacceptable.</p> </div><!-- S",
