<p>Suddenly, I was considering my past and future. What does it mean to build a life? What do I want to leave behind?</p><p>This fall, my husband and I worked with a family law attorney to write our wills and advance directives. We attempted this 10 years ago, after our first child was born, but abandoned the project amid sleep deprivation and the overwhelm of new responsibilities. Now that we are the parents of two no-longer-little kids, and more accustomed to the many losses and logistics of adulthood, we decided it was time to see it through.</p><p>During a two-hour meeting with our lawyer, he asked questions regarding end-of-life scenarios: if you were to both pass away, who would you choose to raise your children if they are minors?

<p>Despite fighting going on just miles away, some Ukrainians are looking to the future – by planting sturdy English oaks</p><p>Yuriy Bengus, a biologist, surveyed a scene of destruction. The Zhuravli forest, on the northern edge of Ukraine’s second city, Kharkiv, was a blackened mess. Rooks cawed from burned pine trees and hopped between stumps. A dead bird lay in an abandoned military dugout. War was down the road. From somewhere to the north of Kharkiv came a muffled boom.</p><p>Bengus plunged his spade into the sandy earth. “From an ecological point of view, oaks are most suitable,” he said. His assistant, Yulia Kucherevska, a 16-year-old volunteer, reached into a plastic bag, pulling out three acorns that she tossed into a shallow hole. The pair moved on to the next spot and threw in three more. Behind them a No 16 tram rattled past.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/31/ukraine-volunteers-saving-kharkiv-war-charred-woodland">Continue reading...</a>

Now, you can buy one in under two minutes from your couch.</p><p>Online shopping should have made my life easier. Being able to purchase from home or on my commute should have freed up my time and energy. It should have also made me a more ethical, conscious consumer. No need to load up on plasticky tops from Forever 21 – I could use my phone to shop secondhand or from sustainable brands. Instead, the siren song of cute clothes consumed my brain and lured me on to the rocks of infinite scrolling, consumerism and credit card debt.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2024/dec/31/how-i-beat-overwhelm-i-ditched-online-c
