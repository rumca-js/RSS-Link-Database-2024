## Show HN: Obsess Jobs – Apply to jobs in your sleep
 - [https://obsessjobs.com](https://obsessjobs.com)
 - RSS feed: $source
 - date published: 2024-12-31T14:58:01+00:00

<p>Hello! I got tired of filling out applications so I built a bot to do it for me. I decided it would probably be useful to everyone else looking for a job in this hellish market, so I built a site that applies to jobs for you, completely automatically. It took me about three months to build and I'm pretty proud of how smoothly it works.
You can: 
Click the "Auto Apply" button next to postings in the search results and keep scrolling. It'll get added to a queue and processed within 2-5 minutes
Click the Zero-Click toggle in the top right of a search and it will automatically apply day and night to jobs that fit that criteria.<p>I also added some other cool stuff like real time updates and the ability to see any submitted application and the exact answers that were provided so that you can monitor and self-validate.
All applications are completed on the company's actual job board so your application has priority over 3rd party job aggregator sites. It doesn't go straight to the trash

<p>Could HN benefit from a TLS upgrade, as it's currently at TLS v1.2, (not e.g.: v1.3) (for me, at least)? Also could it benefit from being a leader in implementing post-quantum cryptography?<p>Cloudflare is beginning to implement it:

(See cloudflare blog posts about it, too for many more details)..</p>
