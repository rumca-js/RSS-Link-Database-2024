Because you don&#39;t really want very different words out at the same time, they are put on opposites sides of a card.

I had a question to clarify a rule in this game dealing with trading the 3 sprouts for 2 soil. The rule book says that you can do that anytime in the game except while gaining sprouts during the watering action or while resolving abilities. We are arguing whether or not you can do that during the watering action turn itself after you have already gained the 6 (or whatever possible) sprouts. The argument is basically \u201cyou can\u2019t do it during the entire turn of the watering action (blue action)\u201d vs \u201cyou can\u2019t only while gaining them in the gaining phase of the watering action\u201d.

It seems to be saying that the bundle I\u2019m buying which includes the base game and expansions would all release around September 2025. I know this is an estimated date to begin with, but assuming the game releases in September 2025, is the developer of the game also targeting that everything in the bundle releases at the same time?

But holy fucking shit, this is the worst developed game I&#39;ve ever endured in my life.</p> <p>There are an abundance of editorial errors, from obvious grammatical mishaps and misspellings, to contextual fandom goofs that make it seem like this whole game was assembled by someone who had watched the series once with ex. Perhaps worse is the complete lack of nuance and understanding of what makes card comparison games fun. Each answer card in this cardboard catastrophe is about ten words long jamming in every salacious descriptor that the so-called designers could dredge up from urban dictionary.

I looked at BGG and was surprised by the variety for a specific game.</p> <p>As an example I have a few games with 57mm/2.25\u201d x 89mm/3.5\u201d cards. I assumed that would be the size I&#39;d need, but what I found on &quot;recommended&quot; on BGG was:</p> <p>59x91<br/> 57x89<br/> 57x90<br/> 58x89<br/> 57.5x89<br/> 59x93<br/> 59.5x91<br/> 60.5x92<br/> 57x91<br/> 59x91.5</p> <p>The variety seems a bit excessive. If it&#39;s a matter of extra room why (for instance) are there no sleeves with a consistant gap, a half milimeter(57.5x89.5) or 1 milimeter(58x90)? I guess 59x91 qualifies with a 2 millimeter border but that&#39;s it.</p> <p>1) Does anybody know w/ certainty why the situation is like this?<br/> 2) What is your recomendation &amp; (briefly) why? </p> <p>Thanks.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/elric132\"> /u/elric132 </a> <br/> ",
