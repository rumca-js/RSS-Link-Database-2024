This also aids my memory, especially when a book is part of a series and I read the last installment years ago. Goodnotes introduced an AI feature a while back that has significantly enhanced the usefulness of my notes. It can even interpret my poor handwriting. I was particularly impressed by its ability to infer details that I jot down but don‚Äôt explicitly state, such as character motives and underlying themes.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all. I&#39;d like to start supporting more independent, local bookstores, but I bought into the Kindle ecosystem a long time ago and it&#39;d be hard to move away from it at this point. Anyone have insight on how I could send my business to my local, or at least independent, shops while still reading the books on a Kindle?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/FigaroTheParrot"> /u/FigaroTheParrot </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hq2wuz/how_can_i_support_independent_book_sellers_from_a/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hq2wuz/how_can_i_support_independent_book_sellers_from_a/">[comments]</a></span>
