## If a police officer searches my devices and found copies of Blu-ray movies, will I be in trouble?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>If I get searched by police and immigration and found copies of movies on my devices, can they use it as grounds to arrest or detain me?</p> <p>Suppose they are INDEED pirated and they found proof, am I in trouble? Suppose I purchased the Blu-ray discs legally and ripped them myself, but I am unable to prove I purchased them, am I in trouble?</p> <p>I had this question for so long, but never asked in fear that it might come across as a stupid question.</p> <p>This is not a question of whether they should search me or not though. This is a what-if question when they search my devices. For example, this happens a lot on immigration counters where they ask to see my devices to prove my intention to visit is for leisure.</p> <p>An officer might not be okay with letting me off the hook with terabytes of movies.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/seandotapp"> /u/seandotapp </a> <br/> <span><a href="https:

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have crappy internet and so downloading a gig file takes a very long time and my internet connect breaks often so if it doesn’t allow continuation then the download time was for naught. I’m also not bothered by 720p versus anything higher. 360p is where YouTube plays.</p> <p>The megathread had a low filesize site link but all the links I have tried to get from there are all dead. Every. Single. One. The torrents (just tried I hate torrents) aren’t seeded either with multiple people usually asking for seeds. Plus you have to jump through hoops and I assume empty my PII to the world and use my machine as a miner. Still! I want the movie I’m looking for.</p> <p>So I have come here to beg and hope that someone somewhere knows a better place for sub 1gig downloads. I know my chances are slim because if the unicorn existed it’d probably be on the list. But my normal DL site isn’t listed so I thought I’d ask.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#

After searching for quite some time for a quality file of a specfic album of his, I was finally able to find a high-quality rip (directly from an original copy of the cassette) from a university&#39;s virtual library collection.</p> <p>Sadly, there are only JW Player clips of the songs, but no option to download them.</p> <p>Is there anyway I can be able to download the song files in high-quality? I have been searching for such files like crazy, and only being able to listen but not download them for my personal collection has been driving me crazy.</p> <p>Thanks in advance!</p> <p>(P.D.: I know technically this isn&#39;t &quot;piracy&quot; since the singer and the original indie-lable have been long gone and due to the nature of his work, it most likely wasn&#39;t copyrighted.

Getting ready to set sail again and have some questions pertaining to VPNs. </p> <p>Let&#39;s say I purchase Mullvad or Proton. Can I bind it to my router so that all traffic in my home (wired and wireless devices) use it, or should I only set it up specifically on the devices that need it? Is that necessary or overkill?</p> <p>Example: 2 Xboxes, 1 PS5, 1 Nintendo switch, 2 cell phones, 2 smart TVs, 2 Roku&#39;s, 1 desktop, 1 laptop. Not everything needs to go through VPN, right? I am mostly interested in setting it up for the laptop, desktop, and cell phones, but don&#39;t know if it&#39;s needed. </p> <p>Additional info: I use a VPN on my desktop to connect to my work network. Will running 2 VPNs mess me up?</p> <p>Thanks! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.re

## Purpose of Docker for PleX / media server

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Keep in mind, I’m an idiot. As best I can tell, main reason to set up Docker and run containers is to run torrents behind a VPN while having PleX in another container not behind the VPN to avoid any issues PleX clients may have with distant IPs. All while running on a single set of hardware / server and not having one set of hardware running a VPN to then physical move drives to a separate non-VPN PleX server hardware setup. Again, remember, I’m an idiot. Understand there are other benefits of making it easy to migrate setups from one set of server hardware to another. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/No_Flounder5160"> /u/No_Flounder5160 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1hq363a/purpose_of_docker_for_plex_media_server/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1hq363a/purpose_of_docker_for_plex_media_server/">[comments]</a></

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi! I&#39;ve basically bought some games on Steam sales which aren&#39;t on cs.rin.ru or f95, so I was wondering, what are the steps to upload them? I already uploaded a game to f95 a while ago, but in that case they didn&#39;t have it at all, however in this case one of the games I want to upload is simply VERY outdated, it doesn&#39;t even have the dlc that I do have, so I don&#39;t know if I have to upload the entire game or somehow extract only the update files of the current version and merge them with their version or something like that, and about cs.rin.ru, I&#39;ve never uploaded anything, I don&#39;t have the slightest idea of ​​how it works 😅 and I also don&#39;t know what steps to follow for security, in my country piracy without profit is totally legal (Technically, it&#39;s more like simply saying &quot;Very bad, but I won&#39;t punish you&quot; since it is an illicit act, but not illegal.) but I would still prefer not to leave too much
