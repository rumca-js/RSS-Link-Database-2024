<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have this UiPath job that runs every week but it takes like 10 hours to finish. It visits a webpage and gathers all info I need and puts into an excel sheet. It uses a notepad file where I placed 800 http links from 1 website.</p> <p>I am happy with the result but it takes too long. Would node.js script with puppeteer be faster?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/misterno123"> /u/misterno123 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1hq5acn/uipath_or_nodejs_script_with_puppeteer_to_scrape/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1hq5acn/uipath_or_nodejs_script_with_puppeteer_to_scrape/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello world!</p> <p>Sorry if this is a stupid question, but I am wondering how do platforms like PimEyes acquire so much content for their face detection? They are almost 100% using a sort of a web scraper, but which one would be the most similar &amp; open source to theirs?</p> <p>If someone could link some GitHub projects that could do the same as their web scraper I would be very thankful. I have about 10000 working proxies checked against google.com.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/makedonc"> /u/makedonc </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1hq3092/how_does_pimeyes_get_their_images/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1hq3092/how_does_pimeyes_get_their_images/">[comments]</a></span>
