So far, for my full-stack, I know HTML/CSS/JS, React, learning Node.Js, and other stuff like that. What specialties are worth getting into these days that won’t go away soon? Should I switch from trying to be a general developer to something more niche?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi you all, companies or content creator on dev, seems to all agree that Graphql is garbage. It needs a bit more time to secure it, but then it&#39;s wonderful to work with it. I don&#39;t necessarily always agree with the &quot;It makes exchange between frontend devs and backend devs easier. But you have typing, fragments, final result is one file that you can easily read, testing is WAY better than any REST solution.. So am I missing something ? Or is it juste a &quot;trend&quot; thing where people have to say Graphql is bad, like PHP ? I would really appreciate your experience/opinions about this. I use it for all of my projects and it was always awesome !
