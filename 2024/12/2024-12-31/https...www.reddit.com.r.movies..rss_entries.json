The refrigerator actually scared me for some reason. I like at the end when sara, marion, and tyrone curl up into a fetal position. It quite symbolic to me. The fact that it is all very real and these things actually happen to ppl is very sad. Great portrayal of how drug addictions can ruin one\u2019s life. Honestly a great movie, but a disturbing and tragic one. 4 stars for me. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/taeminiesheartshaker\"> /u/taeminiesheartshaker </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hqpfxx/requiem_for_a_dream/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hqpfxx/requiem_for_a_dream/\">[comments]</a></span>",

As a ex band kid, music and especially soundtracks are a marked and integral part of my interests. I&#39;d like to start off by proposing Cars 2. Now it is a terrible, poorly put together film with a damn well stupid yet simultaneously overtly convoluted plot, however on recollection the only two elements I can find in it that it has going for it is firstly, how it&#39;s environments look, although given it&#39;s a Pixar film, there is little to be extracted from that, and secondly, it&#39;s soundtrack. Composed by Michael Giacchino, admittedly it&#39;s not to such a degree of quality I like, listen to all of it on the regular, however man, for such a idiotic poorly written Bond inspired spy car, the musical motif and theme is so infuriatingly catchy and euphonious, it is such a tremendous shame it is not the classy espionage track ",

The Bonnie and Clyde story is told from the law enforcement&#39;s POV, but showing that the murderrers,robbers are quite popular in the age of depression and economic uncertainty.</p> <p>At one point Harrelson&#39;s character says while driving through a tent camp:&quot; I didn&#39;t know how good I had it.&quot; although he is living in a forclosured by the bank house.</p> <p>We can even understand why Bonnie and Clyde became popular, they mostly robber banks and killed policemen. The banks were the ones doing the foreclosures and the policemen were enforcing that. (they did murder innocents too though but that didn&#39;t alter their public perception)</p> <p>The whole movie has a beautiful but haunting soundtrack, and there are no winners here, everybody is suffering some way or other.

I have almost nothing but praise to offer... but I understand the critique of the romanticization of rape in this film. I think that it is totally reasonable for a person to avoid and express distaste towards media with rape and violence in it (regardless of whether or not that film is condemning or supporting rape). I also agree that male filmmakers in general always seem to be a bit <em>too</em> interested in exploring the impact of rape on women, and are interested in articulating that with long rape scenes.</p> <p>That being said, I think that Yee&#39;s sexual aggression in this film is crucial to a major part of Wong&#39;s character: her daddy issues.

However William Powell movies like The Thin Man and Jewel Robbery are not. Lots of places have them for rent or buy digital but no streaming. Which if I have to purchase I would rather have a DVD or BluRay. </p> <p>According to google the last time this was asked here was 4yrs ago. Most suggestions were TCM, Max, Prime, or Criterion.
