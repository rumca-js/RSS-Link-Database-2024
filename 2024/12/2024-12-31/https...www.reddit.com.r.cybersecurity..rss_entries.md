We’ve accumulated tools from a range of providers over the years, and while they all serve a purpose, the overlap and complexity are becoming a headache. Thinking about consolidating where it makes sense but don’t want to compromise on coverage (especially with EDR, SIEM, and identity solutions).</p> <p>For those of you who’ve done this, how did you decide what to keep, consolidate, or cut entirely? Also, any recommendations for vendors that offer solid all-in-one solutions without locking you into a walled garden?

We’re a small business with around 30-50 employees, and the challenge we face is that we’re not an IT-focused organization. Our team isn’t particularly tech-savvy, and there’s often resistance to adopting new processes or changes. Additionally, our budget is extremely limited, so expensive solutions are not an option.</p> <p>I know that protecting against ransomware requires a multi-layered approach, but I’m looking for practical, low-cost (or free) solutions that are realistic for our environment. Specifically, I’m trying to figure out how to educate employees about phishing and ransomware in a way that’s simple and digestible, especially for those who aren’t comfortable with technology.</p> <p>Beyond that, I’d like advice on basic security hygiene practices that we can implement without overwhelming the team.

Every action I have to take requires approval, and I can only work by telling someone in the IT team to fix or respond. My team is not very well-educated on cybersecurity. I have had to teach and convince them to implement basic security practices, such as patch management and responding to incidents that need immediate action, like isolating an end user. The point is, every action concerning security needs to be done by other IT staff, and I can only report.

I know there are a lot of people on here that aren&#39;t. </p> <p>That said, I&#39;m coming up on 3 years in my current role. I enjoy what I do for the most part, but I&#39;m finding there&#39;s no upward mobility...at least not for the foreseeable future. Security is a very bottom-up approach at the moment and there&#39;s no vision, or at times too many visions, as to where my group (currently comprised of just me) is going. So I have job security, but no path forward. I feel like my knowledge progression has stagnated and I&#39;m finding myself increasingly unmotivated when it comes to pursuing certifications or just even diving into new topics that I&#39;m interested in (AI, GRC, CE for cloud security). The job market is terrible and with no real progression in the immediate future where I&#39;m at...</p> <p>Ultimately I know the answer is to just buckle down, diving into the ar
