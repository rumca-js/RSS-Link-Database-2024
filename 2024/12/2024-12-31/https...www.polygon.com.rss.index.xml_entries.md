<p class="has-text-align-none">I realized recently that it’s rare I watch something on YouTube unless there’s a unique hook or challenge attached. When it comes to games, it’s usually speedrunning attempts, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23291938/pokemon-nuzlocke-challenge-difficulty-guide">Nuzlocke runs</a>, catching a shiny of every Pokémon before moving on — that sort of thing — and this probably explains why I’ve found GeoWizard, a channel that introduces self-imposed restrictions to exploring the real world, so entertaining.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Boxing is a full-body workout. Deceptively so — you’re just moving your arms, how tough could it be, right? But if you’re throwing a punch correctly, you’re putting your entire body into that motion. A boxing punch should involve a whole set of simultaneous movements that engage your legs, your core, your shoulders, <em>and </em>your arms. <em>Fitness Boxing 3</em> cannot offer the same experience as an in-person trainer correcting your every move. But it does provide a series of easy-to-learn routines and daily workouts that ramp up into a regimen that could whip you into shape about as well as attending regular in-person group boxing classes.</p>
