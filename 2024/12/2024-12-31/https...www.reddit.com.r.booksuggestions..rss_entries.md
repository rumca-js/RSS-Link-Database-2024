Earlier this year I saw that Apple+ was planning a TV series on it that gave me the motivation to finally read it. I liked it but felt it was a little dated seeing that it was written during the 1950s but it was still a good story.</p> <p>Just finished watching watching the final episode of the TV series and not quite sure how I feel about it. I mean, yes they had to make it set in present day after COVID and all to make it appease today&#39;s crowd but I think some of the other changes were unneeded but then again, to make it all fit into 6x42 minute episodes I guess I can understand.</p> <p>One thing that really irked me in the TV show seemed to go against most of the written material. in t

In the last 2 months or so I&#39;ve read Dark Places and Sharp Objects by Gillian Flynn, The Kind Worth Killing, The Kind Worth Saving and A Talent For Murder by Peter Swanson.</p> <p>I&#39;m looking for more books in similar style, especially compared to the Swanson books, so a short-ish, snappy and exciting writing with a good number of twists. Flynn&#39;s books were just a touch slower, weirder and more cerebral, which worked for me as well, but I preferred the former.</p> <p>Bonus points for a good narrator and/or ensemble, as these days I mostly listen to audiobooks (they are easier to fit into my routine and my bad eyes made reading much less enjoyable than it used to be, so I limit reading to work-related activities). Added bonus points for great characters and/or books written from the POV of the main character(s) (not strictly nece

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been an avid reader most of my life, but have recently suffered from a social media lobotomy. I miss being absorbed by a novel and having a respectable attention span. What are some short and engaging reads to get me back into reading for the new year? I also feel like many of my book choices have been obvious lately, so some interesting or surprising picks would be much appreciated!</p> <p>Some of my favorites from the past year (before I lost my spunk) include Count of Monte Cristo, Half of a Yellow Sun, Kafka on the Shore, Breasts and Eggs, In the Shadow of Man, The Color Purple, Love in the Time of Cholera. I&#39;m open to most genres (including nonfiction!), but trying to start with something that&#39;s not too much of a slog (though that can be worth it sometimes).

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>hi my fav redditors - hope u are enjoying the holiday season and are hitting your 2024 reading goals </p> <p>ok so severance by Ling Ma is hands down my favorite book of all time. I love how it blends psychological horror with a post-apocalyptic setting, especially the unsettling juxtaposition of ordinary, mundane spaces becoming part of the dystopia—like when they’re in the abandoned mall and when she’s in the old navy (lol) !! ugh amazing.</p> <p>i also loved Leave the World Behind and i’m just finishing Your Shadow Half Remains (so good, might be my fave of the year). I love their deep psychological tension and existential themes. these stories have that same eerie, creeping unease, where the horror is not just external but deeply tied to the characters’ emotional and psychological survival as society unravels. </p> <p>i also just watched Alex Garland’s Civil War and absolutely LOVED IT! </p> <p>and also watched I Saw the TV Glow and loved it too,
