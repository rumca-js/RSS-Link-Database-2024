As someone who grew up playing games like the Uncharted series, assassin’s creed 2, just cause 2, black ops 1 campaign and singularity, I feel like im missing out on so many great games even tho i have access to alot of them. The thing is, i tried playing them but it just doesnt feel the same. From ghost of tsushima, to days gone, tlou2 and red dead redemption 2, I just play a little bit of the game and then put it down and forget about it. But i want to change that, i spend my time lurking in reddit servers reading people’s experiences and ratings
