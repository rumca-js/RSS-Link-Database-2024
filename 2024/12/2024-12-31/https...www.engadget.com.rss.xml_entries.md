<p>There’s no longer any question that Threads and Bluesky have created the most viable alternatives to the platform once known as Twitter. But while the two services may share some of the same goals, they’ve shown very different visions for how text-based social networks should operate.</p>
<p>Threads, of course, is controlled by Meta, which is controlled by Mark Zuckerberg. And though  the company has claimed to embrace “public conversation,” it has also consistently put its thumb on the scale to encourage certain types of speech over others. The company throttled “political” content in an election year, forcing users to tweak their settings to enable posts about elections or “social topics” to appear in their “for you” feed.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This desire to limit any of what Meta described as "potentially sensitive" content has also led to some questionable moderation decisions. For months, the app <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:

<p>When it comes to new horror games, there are times of feast and famine, and this past year we gorged until our bellies bulged and our mouths dripped with gruesome grease. In 2024, we received a rich spread of dark experiences from solo creators, indie teams, AA developers and AAA studios in a vast array of genres and visual styles. There was a fantastic <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake and beefy updates to contemporary classics like <em>Phasmophobia, Alan Wake 2</em> and <em>The Outlast Trials</em>, and there was also a steady cadence of brand-new horror franchises expanding the genre in unexpected ways.</p>
<p>First, let’s take a moment to celebrate a sampling of the year’s fresh horror universes. In 2024, we got the following new titles:</p>

<p>It’s no secret that Russia has been slowly working towards eschewing as much Western technology as it can and developing its own, and its latest effort seems to be related to video games. On December 25, Anton Gorelkin, Deputy Chairman of the State Duma Committee on Information Policy, <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://t.me/s/webstrangler/3937"><ins>revealed</ins></a> some information on a domestic video game console being developed by the Ministry of Industry and Trade, as reported by <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.techspot.com/news/106133-russia-admits-domestic-consoles-cant-match-ps5-or.html"><em><ins>TechSpot</ins></em></a>. The theoretical console will have an Elbrus processor and be powered by either Aurora or Alt Linux, both Russian forks of the popular Linux operating system.</p>
<p>According to <em>TechSpot</em>, the Elbrus processor was developed by the Moscow Center of SPARC Technologies and primarily designed for defense, critical infrastructure

<p>Mobile gaming may still be thought of as a casual pastime, but it doesn’t have to be that way. There are plenty of action titles like <em>Call of Duty Mobile</em>, <em>Fortnite</em>, <em>Dead Cells</em> and <em>PUBG Mobile</em> to tackle, and you don’t have to settle for imprecise touch controls. When it comes to close combat you’re going to want to invest in a good mobile gaming controller, and these are the ones we’d recommend based on quality and price.</p>
