Frog populations worldwide are being decimated by the chytrid fungus, which is responsible for the decline and extinction of many species. Scientists have developed "frog saunas," simple heated structures that allow frogs to warm up and combat the infection. Studies show that this method can help infected frogs recover faster and even develop resistance to future infections. The saunas are an affordable and scalable solution, offering a promising strategy to protect frogs, particularly in Australia

A team of astronomers, led by Emma Schwartzmann from the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, used the Very Large Array (VLA) to study the nearby galaxy cluster merger CIZA J0107.7+5408 (CIZA0107). The observations provided new insights into the dynamics of galaxy mergers, revealing a disturbed system with two subclusters and diffuse radio emission spanning 1.6 million light-years. Spectral analysis showed a similar spectral index across both subclusters, with ultra-steep spectral regions identified in the northwestern and southeastern areas. The study also found that the emission associated with the southwestern subcluster shows a sharp radio edge at lower frequencies but extends beyond shock fronts at higher frequencies. The findings suggest CIZA0107 may host a double halo structure
