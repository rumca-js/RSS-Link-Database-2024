<p>Hartley Charlton, MacRumors:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple TV+ is set to be available to stream for free from Saturday,
January 4 to Sunday, January 5, providing its full catalog with no
subscription fee. Following a series of teasers, Apple today
confirmed the free weekend on social media, building anticipation
for new releases early in 2025 such as the second season of
<em>Severance</em>. Simply open the Apple TV app to watch for free.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bizarrely, the only place Apple announced this seems to be <a href="https://x.com/AppleTV/status/1873730763356795379">on X</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DENIBgIRhrQ/">Instagram</a>. Not a word on <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/">Apple Newsroom</a>, for example.</p>

<p>Apple TV+ has an abundance of great shows (but a relative dearth of good original movies, with Scorsese’s <em><a href="https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/killers-of-the-flower-moon/umc.cmc.5x1fg9vferlfeutzpq6rra1zf">Killers of the Flower Moon<

<p>James Fallows, in a 2023 piece for The Atlantic, written when Carter entered hospice care:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Jimmy Carter survived to see many of his ambitions realized,
including <a href="https://www.cartercenter.org/news/pr/2023/2022-guinea-worm-worldwide-cases-announcement.html">near eradication</a> of the dreaded Guinea worm,
which, unglamorous as it sounds, represents an increase in human
well-being greater than most leaders have achieved. He survived
to see his character, vision, and sincerity recognized, and to
know that other ex-presidents will be judged by the standard he
has set.</p>

<p>He was an unlucky president, and a lucky man.</p>

<p>We are lucky to have had him. Blessed.</p>
