It\u2019s called the <strong>OpenWrt DFS Checker</strong>, and it\u2019s designed to handle DFS radar events that can cause 5GHz networks to drop and not recover. </p> <p>Recently, I moved to a densely populated area where the non-DFS channels are heavily occupied by neighboring units. Switching to DFS channels has significantly improved my wireless browsing experience, but it comes with the challenge of dealing with radar detection events. This script helps automate the process of switching to a fallback channel when DFS radar is detected and attempting to recover the primary channel later. </p> <p>This project builds on the fantastic work by <strong><a href=\"/u/try_harder_later\">u/try_harder_later</a></st",

I am new to VMware and just recently started my own home lab. What i am trying to do is host a website through a VM. The problem i am running into is connecting to the VM outside of the lan. I have made a virtual switch in vmware but still can not get an external ip address for my VM.
