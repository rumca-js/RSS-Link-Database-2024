        "description": "2024 has been a fantastic year for Warhammer and for painting! There have been so many great new releases and we\u2019ve all had so much fun. As the year comes to a close, we thought it would be a cool idea to ask each paint presenter which was their favourite miniature to paint this year. \n\nWhat is your favourite miniature of 2024? Let us know in the comments! \n\nOllie\u2019s: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGwihhNkfGY&t=1019s\nDan\u2019s: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSgiG9uT8Vw\nJake:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhqprRvQJyg\nAdam\u2019s: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNWJKFWGusA\nEmma\u2019s: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRVCKZqF11o\n\nFollow for more Warhammer, more often:\n\n- Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/warhammerofficial/\n- Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/WarhammerOfficial/\n- X: https://x.com/warhammer\n- Warhammer Community: https://www.warhammer-community.com/\n- Get Warhammer in your inbox: https://ow.ly/6SJq50T3NL1",
