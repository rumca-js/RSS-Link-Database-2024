<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Argentina has announced a bold initiative to position itself as a global leader in artificial intelligence (AI) and sustainable energy through its new Nuclear Plan. The plan includes building modular nuclear reactors (SMRs) to support the energy demands of AI systems, which continue to grow as models like OpenAI&#39;s GPT-4o require massive computational resources.</p> <p>AI systems, especially advanced LLMs, consume significant amounts of power during training and operation. According to reports, complex queries using state-of-the-art AI models can cost thousands of dollars in energy per task. Argentina&#39;s focus on nuclear power aims to address this challenge by providing scalable and sustainable energy solutions.</p> <p>Key Highlights:</p> <ul> <li>Modular nuclear reactors to power AI-focused data centers.</li> <li>Leverage Argentina&#39;s existing expertise in nuclear technology and natural resources.</li> <li>Establish AI hubs in Patagonia, ut

## Will AI cheats kill online multiplayer games as we know them?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I was thinking about the trajectory of AI and how it relates to multiplayer games, namely within the context of cheats. Nowadays aimbots, wallhacks, and such are still detectable because they have to run directly on the system. In the future as AI gets more advanced and ubiquitous, however, I find it hard to imagine this won&#39;t impact the cheat industry in a big way as well.</p> <p>I can easily see a future where everyone, or at least most, have access to artificial intelligence that is able to replace the player—or some part, such as aim—through the use of computer vision. This doesn&#39;t necessarily have to run on the system , but it can just send the inputs to the game just like the player would. That will at least theoretically make it almost completely undetectable. It will be just like a good player.</p> <p>So this made me think, could arcades come back in some form? If online gaming is completely taken over by AIs, then the only way to pla

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone!</p> <p>For a bit of context, we are writing a free <a href="https://synaptiks.ai/">newsletter </a>on AI, with the goal of helping people understand AI and save time. At the moment, I&#39;m particularly interested in the time-saving aspect, because the more AI tools I use, the more time I save, and I don&#39;t want to miss any important ones.</p> <p>I&#39;d say that for me, the biggest time gains come from:</p> <ol> <li>ChatGPT - the new Canvas and search features are awesome!</li> <li>Gamma - for presentation creation</li> <li>Granola - for the meeting part</li> <li>Recraft - helps me a lot with image generation</li> </ol> <p>What about you guys?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Just stumbled across this AI startup called Astreyon.ai, and it seems kind of wild. From what I can tell, it’s like an AI version of HubSpot that brings together over 1,000 different AI models in one platform. Has anyone else heard of this or used it? I’m curious how it works, do you just pick the models you need, or does it integrate them automatically? It seems like it could be insanely powerful for businesses or creators, but I’m wondering if it’s legit or just a lot of hype. They seem very new.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/LanceDoesThings"> /u/LanceDoesThings </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1hqf4w4/found_an_insane_ai_startup/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1hqf4w4/found_an_insane_ai_startup/">[comments]</a></span>

He is saying that there is an AI in TT that you can talk to and interact to, to get the posts you want to see, and all of the comments are people who agree with him; they talk to their TT AI that is &quot;built in Tiktok&quot; (i guess?) to get what they want on their fear. Do you guys agree with him? Is TT listining to us and/or using &quot;brain-reading&quot; technology?</p> <p>Here is the video: <a href="https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNewbjRtq/">https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNewbjRtq/</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Intrepid_Ad9628"> /u/Intrepid_Ad9628 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1hqdtk3/tiktok_algorithm_listening_to_you/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1hqdtk3/tiktok_algorithm_lis
