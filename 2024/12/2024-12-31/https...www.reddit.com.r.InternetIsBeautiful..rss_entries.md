<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Someone said my website is &quot;ass&quot;</p> <p>Hello community, </p> <p>So today I was working on this one website which took me hours. It is a website for people to download my little game. And then that one guy says &quot;your website is ass&quot;. Well personally I don&#39;t really think it&#39;s &quot;ass&quot;.</p> <p>I know this person from my class. He is also interested in becoming a software engineer. He sometimes sends snaps of him coding. But I don&#39;t really know why he said that my website is &quot;ass&quot;.</p> <p>Guys I want an honest review of my website. If it&#39;s bad it&#39;s bad.</p> <p>The website: <a href="https://lazymagnateens.github.io/Website/">https://lazymagnateens.github.io/Website/</a></p> <p>Thank you so much.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/HotdogSmashMan"> /u/HotdogSmashMan </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://lazymagnateens.github.io/Website/">[link]</a></spa
