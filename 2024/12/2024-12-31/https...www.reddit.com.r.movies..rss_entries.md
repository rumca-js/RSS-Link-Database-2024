<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This and mysterious skin are literally horror movies. But requiem for a dream, i thought was done really well and it was all so abrupt. The refrigerator actually scared me for some reason. I like at the end when sara, marion, and tyrone curl up into a fetal position. It quite symbolic to me. The fact that it is all very real and these things actually happen to ppl is very sad. Great portrayal of how drug addictions can ruin one’s life. Honestly a great movie, but a disturbing and tragic one. 4 stars for me. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/taeminiesheartshaker"> /u/taeminiesheartshaker </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hqpfxx/requiem_for_a_dream/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hqpfxx/requiem_for_a_dream/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This movie came out when I was 6 years old. For me, then, it was the best movie I’ve ever seen. Now, almost 25 years later, on New Year’s eve, local TV station is replaying it and I can’t be happier. It’s still as good as it was in childe’s eyes of my own. To everyone who hasn’t seen it, please do, I recomend it from the bottom of my heart. And for all of you youngsters, please watch movies like this, that hasn’t been recycled and has a beautiful story to it. Just beautiful. ❤️</p> <p>Happy New Year to everyone, especialy those who are alone tonight. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/hidraticna"> /u/hidraticna </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hqowkj/fried_green_tomatoes/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hqowkj/fried_green_tomatoes/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Yes, these are broad metrics so this&#39;ll get gray quickly. To me, though, it&#39;s just strange to find movies where the filmmakers spent so much time detailing all the aspects of a new reality only to never realize how dull the end product would be. With all the pre-viz cinematics, table reads, and rough edits only to lose sight of the sum of all the parts. Obviously no one knows everything and it&#39;s great to take these risks, it&#39;s still fascinating.</p> <p>For example, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeHf7UhHpmE">City of Ember</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRsFc2gguEg">Mortal Engines</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWZ7O-RrATY">Tomorrowland</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ftZhphGgwo">Renaissance</a> (bit of a cheat since it&#39;s animated but the new whiz bang tech for it demanded a solid story idea)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https:

## M Night Shymalan and Zack Snyder are much better directors than they are writers. I legitimately think their movies could be incredible if they stopped writing the scripts

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I know a similar post was made a while back, however I am curious on the contemporary consensus and how it has changed. As a ex band kid, music and especially soundtracks are a marked and integral part of my interests. I&#39;d like to start off by proposing Cars 2. Now it is a terrible, poorly put together film with a damn well stupid yet simultaneously overtly convoluted plot, however on recollection the only two elements I can find in it that it has going for it is firstly, how it&#39;s environments look, although given it&#39;s a Pixar film, there is little to be extracted from that, and secondly, it&#39;s soundtrack. Composed by Michael Giacchino, admittedly it&#39;s not to such a degree of quality I like, listen to all of it on the regular, however man, for such a idiotic poorly written Bond inspired spy car, the musical motif and theme is so infuriatingly catchy and euphonious, it is such a tremendous shame it is not the classy espionage track

The banks were the ones doing the foreclosures and the policemen were enforcing that.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I found a recommendation for Doctor Sleep and decided to give it a try. I didn&#39;t even know this movie existed. I thought it had a slow start, but in hindsight I see that time was well spent. When the movie did speed up, I felt I understood these characters and knew what was going on. My partner and I both found this movie very satisfying and were pleasantly surprised as many Stephen King adaptations are sub-par. I would happily place this in the top 3 adaptations of the author.</p> <p>Edit: Thank you all for the suggestions so far. I&#39;ve added a few to my list. To further clarify, I didn&#39;t necessarily mean that I was wondering about other Stephen King adaptations, or horror generally, but rather what are some other films which didn&#39;t get the audience they deserved.</p> <p>P.S. Yes, I saw &quot;The Shining&quot; first.</p> <p>I can&#39;t help but wonder what else I may have missed that&#39;s worth the watch. Any suggestions?</p> </div><

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I just finished watching Lust, Caution by Ang Lee and HOLY SHIT this is my favourite Ang Lee I&#39;ve seen so far. I have almost nothing but praise to offer... but I understand the critique of the romanticization of rape in this film. I think that it is totally reasonable for a person to avoid and express distaste towards media with rape and violence in it (regardless of whether or not that film is condemning or supporting rape). I also agree that male filmmakers in general always seem to be a bit <em>too</em> interested in exploring the impact of rape on women, and are interested in articulating that with long rape scenes.</p> <p>That being said, I think that Yee&#39;s sexual aggression in this film is crucial to a major part of Wong&#39;s character: her daddy issues. I&#39;m actually surprised by how almost no one is talking about this, as I think her relationship with her father actually impacts a lot of her decisions.</p> <p><strong>Her relations

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>It was so awful. Basically a 2 hour trailer to set up the TV show. I bought tickets mainly because I was interested in the sweepstakes, and the trailer looked like something right up my alley (I love anything post apocalypse) but what a waste of 2 hours. </p> <p>The setup didn&#39;t make any sense (two random dudes in a fishing boat can set off a nuke inside of random barrels? Then Russia takes out our entire electric grid?)</p> <p>The only conflict was: oh our food <em>might</em> run out in months, what will we ever do? And a swat team that randomly showed up because of a corrupt government official that needs his taxes! (Who, after all brief shootout, decides to just leave?)</p> <p>I actually do like the message that them letting in the &quot;&quot;&quot;refugees&quot;&quot;&quot; in (basically just their neighbors outside their gate) was ultimately beneficial to them, but that&#39;s going to piss their target off so much that actually might be kin
