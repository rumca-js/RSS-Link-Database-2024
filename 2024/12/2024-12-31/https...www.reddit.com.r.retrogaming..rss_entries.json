You controlled a soldier of some kind, shooting either a gun / magic shots. It was a vertical scroller, in which you could walk on land, from bottom of the screen to top, but could also walk through the occasional lake or stream that flowed through it. </p> <p>Like Guerilla War. </p> <p>It could be played two player.</p> <p>At the end of each level was a boss, each of which were different. They would walk side to side attacking.</p> <p>On defeating the boss, two doors behind the boss would be revealed. You could choose the left or the right door. I believe rhe choice would determine which was the next level. </p> <p>It wasn&#39;t Time Soldiers, but it did play kind of similarly. </p> <p>Any help?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a hr",
