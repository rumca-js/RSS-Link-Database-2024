        "description": "One thing is certain in life: the overriding complaints with annual sports titles. Yet, in 2024, something strange has happened. Much of the year\u2019s sports titles \u2013 typified again by incremental changes and minor iterations \u2013 have been the best entries in their respective franchises for years. \n\nSometimes small changes make a big difference. In amongst the best sports and racing games released this year though aren\u2019t annual updates at all; they\u2019re standalone entries and new experiences \u2013 both simulation and arcade \u2013 and it\u2019s a joy to shine a light on them here. \n\nWhether you\u2019re hitting a home run or burning rubber on your way to the chequered flag, the best sports and racing games capture a feeling of being a sports or racing star in real life, and that\u2019s demonstrated well in this year\u2019s selection.",

        "description": "With many RPGS franchises seeing major sequels over the years, it's interesting to see Bandai Namco's Tales series take a backseat. Fortunately, fans can look forward to Tales of Graces f Remastered on January 17th for Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PS4, PS5, PC, and Nintendo Switch.\n\nBased on the 2012 PS3 title (also based on the 2009 Nintendo Wii classic), Tales of Graces f Remastered follows Asbel and his friends as massive conflict erupts. Sporting the Linear Motion Battle System, complete with new additions like Style Shift, it offers a compelling narrative and fast-paced action.\n\nWhile the remaster doesn't make drastic changes to the visuals, it does include various quality-of-life features. Autosave, a new Dash function, the Grade Shop's availability from the beginning, a new destination marker for quests, and new English voice acting for some Japanese skits are only a few notable things. Check out everything to know before the remaster's launch.",

        "description": "For all the live service looters that faltered in 2024, the year was amazing for almost every other type of role-playing experience. Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, Dragon's Dogma 2, and Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth started the year strong, offering hundreds of hours of incredible story-telling, side quests, and combat.\n\nWhen it seemed things would slow down, other noteworthy titles like Enshrouded, Last Epoch, Another Crab's Treasure, Samurai Showdown, and much more emerged, each receiving strong acclaim. Of course, we also received legendary titles like Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree and Black Myth: Wukong. Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake showed the classic could still hang with the best, while Path of Exile 2 blazed a new path for action RPG fans.\n\nWhich were the best role-playing games from 2024, and what made them stand out from the rest? Check out all of our top picks.",
