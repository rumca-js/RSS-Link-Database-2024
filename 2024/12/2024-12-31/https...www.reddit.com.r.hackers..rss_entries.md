<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>A random instagram account associated with my email was deleted (the email was changed to some unrecognizable email and account was deleted). I switched on 2fa and changed passwords after that. </p> <p>Thereafter, my LinkedIn account has now been deleted (it was associated with a different email- the deletion process was the same. The person changed the associated email and now I can&#39;t find the account anymore. </p> <p>Am I being targeted for something? How could they access my gmail? Because I didn&#39;t authorize the changing of the emails- and how does an instagram account get deleted (they take atleast 30 days). </p> <p>I cannot find a quick way to contact LinkedIn and Instagram. The hacker has access to my email inbox, what do I do?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Worldly-Yam-5543"> /u/Worldly-Yam-5543 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hackers/comments/1hq7xey/im_being_t
