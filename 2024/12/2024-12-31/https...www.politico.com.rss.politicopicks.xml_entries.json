        "description": "New quantum microchips are raising the possibility that the multiverse, something that was to be found only in comic books and sci-fi, could in fact be real. For those trying to keep up with American politics this isn\u2019t really news. We seem to be cracking up, in so many different ways, into different cultural and political tribes, different media eco systems, different political planets. Our parallel universes are now fragmenting into many new galaxies. It makes it hard to keep up and navigate through the nebulous nebulas, the belts of idiocy and bottomless black holes of hubris. We're headed into a whole new political solar system. My mission, as a political cartoonist, is to explore these new uncharted worlds, to seek out new irony and fresh hypocrisies, to boldly go where no other cartoonists have gone before. Here are the latest entries from my cartoon log of the year 2024.",
