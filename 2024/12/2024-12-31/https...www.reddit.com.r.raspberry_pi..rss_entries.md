<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have tried for hours to set up a terraria server on a raspberrypi 5. I need to use mono so I tried to install it which didn&#39;t work. So I decided to compile it from source. On the official <a href="https://www.mono-project.com/docs/about-mono/supported-platforms/arm/">website</a> they recommend scratch box. On there they link to <a href="https://wiki.maemo.org/Documentation/Maemo_5_Final_SDK_Installation#Installing_Maemo_5_SDK_using_Text-based_Installer">this</a> website. When I try to follow to instructions the website doesn&#39;t load. So I tried to install sb2 instead of sb1 like on the website from the <a href="https://github.com/sailfishos/scratchbox2">github</a> and then I tried to install qemu which worked, but eventually failed on installing BayLibre. Can somebody explain to me how to install sb1 / tell me the info which is on the website which dosen&#39;t load?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddi

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello there, I came here for your opinions.</p> <p>I&#39;m thinking of building a home server from Pi 5. Main usage will be NAS/media server but I also want to host some of my side projects there so stuff like nginx, docker, some database but it won&#39;t be anything extra. Don&#39;t expect any high traffic whatsoever.</p> <p>Ok now here comes the question.</p> <p>What do you think about using PCIe HAT with NVMe SSD to run the OS from for better performance of the &quot;server&quot; side of things and attaching 2 HDDs via USB -&gt; SATA adapters and using those for NAS. My concern is the performance of the USB -&gt; SATA.</p> <p>Do you know if there is some better option to have both, fast NVMe for OS but also good performance SATA HDD for NAS. Maybe some specific HAT or something?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/K0koNautilus"> /u/K0koNautilus </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ra

Since SIM cards are simply identifiers, can&#39;t we only connect one to the pi, connect an antenna and go from there?</p> <p>An example of a hat can be found here:<br/> <a href="https://sixfab.com/product/raspberry-pi-5g-development-kit-5g-hat/">https://sixfab.com/product/raspberry-pi-5g-development-kit-5g-hat/</a></p> <p>An example of the grey chip can be fo
