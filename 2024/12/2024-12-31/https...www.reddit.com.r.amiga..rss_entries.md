<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have 2 boxes of floppies mostly games from the early 90s for an amiga 500 i had back in the day. Im wondering what can i do with them? Are they too old to be used and is there a way to treat them for age before use.</p> <p>They&#39;ve been kept in an attic but dry and covered. </p> <p>I got an amiga 500 when i was around 12 and most of the disks i got with it they look like they came from UK markets and swaps and copies but some original bought stuff. From what I remember most were cracked anyway.</p> <p>My amiga i loaned stupidly to a cousin under pressure from an aunt in the 90s and they smashed it so I have no parts or anything just the floppies.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Jolly-Feature-6618"> /u/Jolly-Feature-6618 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1hq9zgk/boxes_of_floppies/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I finally found a song that I was looking for for ages, it&#39;s called Happy Sundays by Radix. Idk if that guy is known in this sub. But right after that, I got a video of another song made in this kind of old software. I wanted to get my hands on it to create some music with is and see what I could do. Also found a bunch of very interesting tutorials on how to use it (Protracker). But I realized it is no normal program and suddenly fell into the rabbit hole of Amiga. I now know that I must emulate an Amiga Environment, but in order to do so, I gotta find a Kickstart ROM type of file and can&#39;t find it anywhere cuz turns out everyone is recommending me to buy a $9 min package to find one file that I don&#39;t even know how to use. I would dive deeper but I really don&#39;t know if it&#39;s worth it... I also got to see that in this sub there are mixed about piracy...
