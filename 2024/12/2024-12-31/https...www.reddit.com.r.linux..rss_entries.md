<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Corporations like Microsoft contribute code to Linux. Not because they love Linux, but because their Azure platforms run on Linux. I think that the only reason they actually contribute code is because of the Free software GPL license. If Linux used an Open Source license like that of FreeBSD, Microsoft could easily fork the code base and make it closed source to make their own additions/modifications to it.<br/> In this regard, I believe Free software licenses are better than Open Source licenses. GPL forces corporations like Microsoft to contribute and play nice, and this benefits the community as a whole.<br/> What are your thoughts on this?
