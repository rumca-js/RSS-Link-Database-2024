With many RPGS franchises seeing major sequels over the years, it's interesting to see Bandai Namco's Tales series take a backseat. Fortunately, fans can look forward to Tales of Graces f Remastered on January 17th for Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PS4, PS5, PC, and Nintendo Switch.

Based on the 2012 PS3 title (also based on the 2009 Nintendo Wii classic), Tales of Graces f Remastered follows Asbel and his friends as massive conflict erupts. Sporting the Linear Motion Battle System, complete with new additions like Style Shift, it offers a compelling narrative and fast-paced action.

While the remaster doesn't make drastic changes to the visuals, it does include various quality-of-life features. Autosave, a new Dash function, the Grade Shop's availability from the beginning, a new destination marker for quests, and new English voice acting for some Japanese skits are only a few notable things. Check out everything to know before the remaster's launch.
