<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>i like the deduction part of social deduction games, who has done what, who claims what, what claims contradict what claims, and trying to solve the knot. what i dont enjoy is the part about trying to convince other people you are telling the truth, and that other people are lying. is there a social deduction game with more focus on the deduction and puzzle element of it, and not really about using rhetoric on the other players?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/snillpuler"> /u/snillpuler </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1hqqv40/social_deduction_game_without_the_arguing/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1hqqv40/social_deduction_game_without_the_arguing/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>In Codenames, word cards have two sides. Have you ever noticed that the opposite sides have very different words? This makes complete sense and I imagine they designed it that way - If two animals were on the same card, they&#39;d never show up together, and never be matched, which would be sad because that&#39;s an easy match. Because you don&#39;t really want very different words out at the same time, they are put on opposites sides of a card. In total, it&#39;s maybe not a huge impact since there are 200 cards mixed up -- but it&#39;s something.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Uuugggg"> /u/Uuugggg </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1hqmiye/subtle_design_choices/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1hqmiye/subtle_design_choices/">[comments]</a></span>

I had a question to clarify a rule in this game dealing with trading the 3 sprouts for 2 soil. The rule book says that you can do that anytime in the game except while gaining sprouts during the watering action or while resolving abilities. We are arguing whether or not you can do that during the watering action turn itself after you have already gained the 6 (or whatever possible) sprouts. The argument is basically ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt do it during the entire turn of the watering action (blue action)‚Äù vs ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt only while gaining them in the gaining phase of the watering action‚Äù. So which side of the argument is correct?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/K-double-A"> /u/K-double-A </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1hqlebz/earth_question_about_trading_sprouts/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a

Fast forward to this week, and we‚Äôve been playing <em>Ark Nova</em>, a complex and dense board game. It‚Äôs been a fascinating journey that I thought would be worthwhile to share. It also illustrates the the invisible barriers to entry in board gaming.</p> <h1>How It All Started: The Gateway Games</h1> <p>I never pushed board games on her. Like any couple, we gravitated toward each other&#39;s interests, and I also thought playing games was a nice alternative to watching TV.

It seems to be saying that the bundle I‚Äôm buying which includes the base game and expansions would all release around September 2025. I know this is an estimated date to begin with, but assuming the game releases in September 2025, is the developer of the game also targeting that everything in the bundle releases at the same time?

Obviously, expecting a cheap reskin of the namesake franchise to be designed with quality is, in itself, folly. But holy fucking shit, this is the worst developed game I&#39;ve ever endured in my life.</p> <p>There are an abundance of editorial errors, from obvious grammatical mishaps and misspellings, to contextual fandom goofs that make it seem like this whole game was assembled by someone who had watched the series once with ex. Perhaps worse is the complete lack of nuance and understanding of what makes card comparison games fun. Each answer card in this cardboard catastrophe is about ten words long jamming in every salacious descriptor that the so-called designers could dredge up from urban dictionary. Gone are the one-liners, the simple character names, the agency of the players to create somthing clever or fun

I assumed that would be the size I&#39;d need, but what I found on &quot;recommended&quot; on BGG was:</p> <p>59x91<br/> 57x89<br/> 57x90<br/> 58x89<br/> 57.5x89<br/> 59x93<br/> 59.5x91<br/> 60.5x92<br/> 57x91<br/> 59x91.5</p> <p>The variety seems a bit excessive. If it&#39;s a matter of extra room why (for instance) are there no sleeves with a consistant gap, a half milimeter(57.5x89.5) or 1 milimeter(58x90)? I guess 59x91 qualifies with a 2 millimeter border but that&#39;s it.</p> <p>1) Does anybody know w/ certainty why the situation is like this?<br/> 2) What is your recomendation &amp; (briefly) why? </p> <p>Thanks.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/elric132"> /u/elric132 </a> <br/>

## When playing vs. other players online, do you like having ELO and other ratings for players?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Ratings can be nice for matchmaking of players of equal skill and encourage more serious play. However, some people take it waaay too far, and become hellbent on winning.</p> <p>Unrated games can be great for casual and lower commitment, but I hear in some circles it&#39;s harder to get in games of those whenever there&#39;s that choice. Also, some players don&#39;t take this type of game seriously enough.</p> <p>.</p> <p>Myself, I have very little experience in this since I haven&#39;t played online in the longest time. </p> <p>The big one was Sea3D; a client used to play games of Settlers of Catan and Seafarers of Catan. It was overall nice, but the few bad apples did manage to ruin it for me. People whining &quot;I really need to win&quot;... &quot;no me, ME!&quot;. Showboating because your ELO was high. People saying to &quot;have fun&quot;, but complain when the dice, trading, and turns in general don&#39;t go your way. OTOH, unrated games here

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>As we head towards the end of 2024, wanted to see what are some of your favourite games (and also how many games people bought).</p> <p>For me, I&#39;ve bought 11 games and 2 expansions this year, mainly starting from July til now. Camel Up 2nd Edition was a hit with my group and though I wouldn&#39;t consider it my favourite, it was the most played as I used it in every session as a filler in between heavier games. My most liked game would be Everdell, worker placement seems to be shaping up to be one of the genres I enjoy greatly. Unfortunately, still have 4 out of the 11 yet to play, but am already eyeing Tzolkin and Inside Job for my next games üòÇ</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/voodoohao"> /u/voodoohao </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1hq3zn0/how_many_boardgames_did_you_buy_for_2024_and/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boa
