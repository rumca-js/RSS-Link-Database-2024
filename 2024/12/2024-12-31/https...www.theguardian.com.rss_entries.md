<p>Over the holidays, this column will explore next year’s urgent issues. Today, the battle over the government’s contradictory plans for the health service</p><p>The British government’s 10-year health plan is still some months off. So is the multi-year spending review that will set the parameters around funding. But the three themes around which Labour plans to build its NHS reforms are set. Each involves a change in emphasis: from treatment to prevention, hospital to community and analogue to digital.</p><p>As health policy is devolved, these plans apply directly only in England. Their impact, though, will be UK-wide, since the largest health system is bound to influence the others, and what happens to the NHS is so crucial to the UK government. In 2025 – Labour’s first full calendar year in office since 2009 – there is arguably no area in which the party is more urgently in need of results.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/dec/31/the-guardian-view-on-la

<p><strong>Venetia Caine </strong>and <strong>Philip Wood </strong>suggest ways to reorganise the upper house, while <strong>Michael Meadowcroft </strong>points to a report that offered practical solutions back in 2007.

A fundamental principle is to retain the revising role of the upper chamber. To that end, it needs great expertise. It should, of course, be largely elected, but that would not necessarily ensure that expertise. It should also not be too large and should have continuity.</p><p>So here is what I suggest should happen: each parliament

<p>The coach is faced with the difficult task of preserving Gareth Southgate’s legacy of unity while also turning the team into one that can end a 60-year trophy drought</p><p>Volker Kersting, Mainz academy director, sighed. Thomas Tuchel, as of Wednesday England’s new manager, had that look in his eyes. “He just said, ‘<em>Volker</em>’ and I knew what was coming,” Kersting said in Rulebreaker<em>,</em> the Tuchel biography by Daniel Meuren and Tobias Schächter. “I’d been dreading it. He really wanted to go up the mountain and dig up that pin.”</p><p>“The pin” was a grubby, small Mainz badge which during a summer pre-season training trip in Austria for Tuchel’s then Mainz under-19s team had assumed almost-sanctified status.

<p>Episodic tale spanning the decades from the 60s to the 00s is a little unoriginal but is delivered with toxic wit</p><p>Although there’s a fair amount of seasonally appropriate snow on display, this horror feature represents a stonking slice of counter-programming for the festive season, given there is nothing merry in the least about it. That said, there are sly flashes of tongue-in-cheek humour throughout from married co-writers Aaron Fradkin (also the film’s director) and Victoria Fratz Fradkin (one of the film’s leads). Consequently, Beezel is an impishly nasty machine for jump scares and creepy just-seen imagery using old-fashioned practical effects. It’s not a terribly original work but does create its own toxic, hypnagogic atmosphere.</p><p>Using a mini-museum’s worth of audiovisual recording technology to capture footage – starting with Super8 and advancing to recent digital cameras – the Fradkins create an episodic work that spans several decades.

<p>Andy Farrell has tricky decisions ahead but expect plenty of Ireland forwards and Scotland backs when the series begins</p><p>The Lions are stronger in certain areas than others and much hinges, in every sense, on Ireland’s front row. No one would quibble hugely if an all-Irish triumvirate of <strong>Andrew Porter, Dan Sheehan </strong>and <strong>Tadhg Furlong</strong> pack down for the first Test against the Wallabies in Brisbane on 19 July – but what if all three are not fully firing? The talented, athletic Sheehan is just back from a long-term lay off and injury forced Porter to withdraw from the last Lions tour to South Africa prior to the squad’s departure. The admirable Furlong, meanwhile, has already been hammering away on Test rugby’s frontline for a decade. It underlines the importance of strength in depth, with the Australian scrum much improved. Both Scotland props, Pierre Schoeman and Zander Fagerson, will fancy making the plane, as will the Wales hooker Dewi Lake (cu
