Whether you're excited for a returning series like Solo Leveling or the final season of Doctor Stone or desperate for a new, highly-anticipated adaptation like Sakamoto Days or Witch Hat Atelier, there's a ton to be excited about. And that's not even including the fact that we're getting a new series from the creator of Cowboy Bebop on Adult Swim. There's something for everyone, so let's dig into our most anticipated anime of 2025, including some already announced titles that we're hoping might end up releasing in 2025.",
