<p>No doubt about it, AMD had a very good year.</p>



<p>Our recap of AMD’s highs, lows, and head-scratching moments of 2024 doesn’t reveal too many mistakes. At times, Intel stumbled through 2024 like someone coming home from the pub on Christmas Eve. But AMD was steady, reliable, and mostly dependable.</p>



<p>See if you agree with us as we walk through the best and worst of AMD’s 2024, as we’ve done (or will do) for Microsoft, Google, and Intel. Will AMD be able to keep up the pace in 2025? </p>

<p>Calling this family a failure may seem a hit harsh, but it’s true that this was one of the few missteps by AMD all year. The <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2193400/amds-ryzen-8000-brings-ai-to-the-desktop-with-an-am4-surprise.html">Ryzen 8000 family</a> fell a bit

<p>The pace of smart home innovation hasn’t slowed a whit in 2024, with new products such as the Amazon Echo Show 21 being unveiled just this week. The <em>better </em>news is that the smart home is no longer a niche market appealing only to enthusiasts willing to tolerate steep learning curves. In other words, the water’s fine! Come on in! </p>



<p>We are, however, still living in a world of smart home silos; namely, Amazon Alexa, Apple HomeKit, and Google Home. The increasingly important Matter standard will unify those ecosystems one day, but that won’t happen until Matter incorporates <em>every </em>smart home category. Today, for example, it doesn’t account for security cameras or video doorbells. Considering that, we’ve picked more than one product in several categories, based primarily on which silo your smart home is in.</p>
