Following a series of teasers, Apple today\nconfirmed the free weekend on social media, building anticipation\nfor new releases early in 2025 such as the second season of\n<em>Severance</em>. Simply open the Apple TV app to watch for free.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Bizarrely, the only place Apple announced this seems to be <a href=\"https://x.com/AppleTV/status/1873730763356795379\">on X</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DENIBgIRhrQ/\">Instagram</a>. Not a word on <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/\">Apple Newsroom</a>, for example.</p>\n\n<p>Apple TV+ has an abundance of great shows (but a relative dearth of good original movies, with Scorsese\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/killers-of-the-flower-moon/umc.cmc.5x1fg9vferlfeutzpq6rra1zf\">Killers of the Flower Moon<",
