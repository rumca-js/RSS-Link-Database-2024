We have just under 1,000 External Infrastructure Ip Ranges, Local IPs, Web Apps, APIs, Configs, Mobile Apps and desktop apps. These are spread across different business areas/ products. Currently on a yearly basis the various teams provide their assets upon request in various formats. 1) Is there a centralised DBMS solution/ ideas 2) Ideally we want the teams to be able to update their assets themselves and it be automatically updated in the central database. 3) Optional features might include connecting it to Tenable and Jira for remediation</p> <p>Side question: In your experience, How do we make sure that the teams in question, provide all of their assets and don&#39;t withhold some to avoid scrutiny. While we trust teams, How do we cover our backs. </p> <p>Thanks in advance! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/PurchaseTrue5063\"> /u/Purcha",

Although I am new, I do not feel like I am gaining the right experience to help me advance to better roles in the future. I am concerned that I barely have any permissions or autonomy. Every action I have to take requires approval, and I can only work by telling someone in the IT team to fix or respond. My team is not very well-educated on cybersecurity. I have had to teach and convince them to implement basic security practices, such as patch management and responding to incidents that need immediate action, like isolating an end user. The point is, every action concerning security needs to be done by other IT staff, and I can only report. I feel like I am not able to take action.</p> <p>The only access I have is limited access in the EDR. Is this true for All jr.security analysts or is it just me?
