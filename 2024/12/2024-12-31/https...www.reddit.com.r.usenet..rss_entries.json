In the beginning I was not as computer literate so I just followed step by step instructions for doing everything. I used to use a program to download binaries from Usenet, I don&#39;t remember what it was called but I didn&#39;t know how to automate so I would physically look at every file in the newsgroup searching for the pieces to join, mostly music back then, I really looked at every single file in many binaries groups. Then 9/11 hit and all of a sudden, to the very day, there were tons of non binary encrypted messages filling the binary groups, all with headers with a sting of random (I assume) numbers. I wouldn&#39;t have noticed it if I had been using the automatic features of the program. I was wondering if terrorists or maybe even the FBI used Usenet for communicating due to it&#39;s little known existence. Many",
