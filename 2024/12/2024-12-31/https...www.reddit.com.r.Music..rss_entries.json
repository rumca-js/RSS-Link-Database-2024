There are songs out there that lyrically hit you with the power of words.... but I think it&#39;s even stronger to have a song without lyrics that can make you cry. Something that kinda grabs you, explains nothing, and pulls the tears out. </p> <p>Years ago, I am talking like 2007 or so, I was exposed to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNrXDrs352g\">Nagisa, a song from the Visual Novel, Clannad</a>. This was actually before the anime of the show came out, I never played the visual novel in full. I knew nothing about this song. But for some reason when I went through this game&#39;s OST, this one song has since, 100% of the time hearing it, makes me cry. Anime, game, whatever have you or not, this is by far the most powerful song I have ever experienced emotionally that effects me, and it has had a hold against me for almost 20 years now, and I was exposed to it prior to even knowing what the song was even about.
