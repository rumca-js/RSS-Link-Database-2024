<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am working on a large app that will provide under one ui data profiling, repository database design, data quality, etl etc. One one the modules is a module that displays the source to target table/column mapping. I&#39;ve been trying to write my own from scratch experimenting with both svg lines and html canvas. Neither are working well for me, since I need to take the location of a div container that lists a tables columns and then draw a line from a source column to a target column. I get a line to draw currently with canvas, but it never lines up with the origin and destination points. So my next thought was is there any libs aout there that have already solved this? I don&#39;t want a licensed product since that then impacts the cost of mine. </p> <p>Any advice, thougths I welcome. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/toooldtohire"> /u/toooldtohire </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.c
