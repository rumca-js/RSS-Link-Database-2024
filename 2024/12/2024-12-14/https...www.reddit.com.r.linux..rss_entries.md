My first distro was Elementary OS, and I loved it. It was minimalistic, way too minimalistic. So I switched to Manjaro. I kept switching distros, it was so easy to do, I kept the same home partition across all my distros so I didn&#39;t have to set everything up again from scratch, I just needed to install the apps I use. Which, again, was so easy because it most cases it was just a single terminal command.</p> <p>I love GNU/Linux as an operating system, and I&#39;ve gotten really used to the workflow, primarily in the GNOME DE. It&#39;s just so pretty and functional. Minimal out of the box, but you could as many extensions as you like.
