None of us mid her writing instead of speaking, she just gets upset when we have to wait for her to write, and I understand her.

I also enjoy shorter, lighter games like Patchwork, Exploding Kittens, The Crew, and Azul. Safe to say, I love board games and can dive into just about anything. </p> <p>However, some games can feel like they overstay their welcome. One example for me is Ark Nova. Maybe it\u2019s because some of my friends take a while to decide on their turns, which slows the pace and drags things out. After a while, my focus starts to waver, and I find myself just wanting the game to end. </p> <p>This got me thinking: Are long, heavy games really worth it for you? Do you always finish them, or do you sometimes wish you\u2019d packed it up early? </p> <p>On a related note, I\u2019m considering learning Twilight Imperium IV and would love to hear from people who\u2019ve played it.

I recently bought the French edition of &quot;Ratjack&quot;, because there are no English prints available and i really want to have it on the table for holiday season play times. But being the French 1st original printing (it&#39;s a French game), it of course has card texts and stuff in French. Rules can be found in English, but the card text is important here, since it governs the play in a major way what you can do as actions depending on the cards you play. Now, needless to say given the headline, i am NOT French, nor can i read French. So i want to somehow translate the printed text and &quot;overlap&quot; English translation on there... I can translate with Google Translate i guess, as the text is short and just about what actions you get to do. </p> <p>But, how to get that text on to the cards? This is the 1st ed. printing and comes with an extra expansion token and so on, so i would rather not write ON the cards. I was thinkin",

We enjoy the occasional boardgame night but we aren&#39;t playing games every weekend. We also like to pull out a game when we have family over on the holidays. One of our challenges is the learning curve with new games. Often times people can get turned off by the length of the rules or are intimidated to play if the rules seem complicated. This is especially true when we try to find a game to play with my parents, or when we have a casual game night with friends who aren&#39;t big into board games. </p> <p>Some games that we really like are: Century Road Golem, Carcassonne, and Catan</p> <p>Some games that have been a bust are: 7 Wonders, Everdell</p> <p>Century Road is a great example of a game where the rules are pretty simple.
