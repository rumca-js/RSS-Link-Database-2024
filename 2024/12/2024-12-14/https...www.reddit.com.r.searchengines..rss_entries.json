There is an individual that is trying to ruin their business, and they have created a similar website that uses the .CO TLD in an attempt to mislead clients. While a few months back doing a search for my friends business using the business name on Google would bring up their site, now the spoof site is the top choice and the real site is not even found going through pages of results.</p> <p>How does something like this happen? Specifically, what are the strategies that are used to do this, and how can it be combated? This fraudster is a real POS who is specifically trying to ruin my friend. Any advice on how to combat this in search results would be appreciated.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/somenuggets\"> /u/somenuggets </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/",
