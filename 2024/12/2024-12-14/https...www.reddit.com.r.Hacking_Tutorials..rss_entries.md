<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have an exam in ethical hacking, and i need to be able to hack my host machine using beef. I have found many tutorials on beef, but those only showed how to connect beef to the internet, or attack the same computer that is hosting beef. I am running beef on kali set up on vmware, with a bridged connection. i used a xss attack on dvwa, with nothing showing up on beef. i tried copying the url of the demo site to my windows computer, but the connection is refused. Im not sure if im using the wrong type of connection within vmware, if the ip address is somehow wrong, or if i have misconfigured something on beef. Does anyone know how to attack the host machine with beef on a virtual machine? would greatly appreciate any help.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/AnySundae421"> /u/AnySundae421 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking_Tutorials/comments/1hdrvlc/how_do_i_use_beefxss_to_att
