<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a 40k and AOS hobbiest who is also a woodworker, and my friend has asked me to build him a table. He has specified a tall breakfast bar style table that he can put in his kitchen to use as work surface when it&#39;s not being used for gaming. He has requested a hidden vault under the worktop with enough room for a 44&quot;x60&quot; gaming area and then just an extra area/divide on the end for books, cards, ipad, dice etc so its looking like it will be a fair size! I was curious to ask the opinion of everyone to see if anything else would be beneficial to this build and just to get an opinion of whether you think this is a good idea as he thinks I can make these and people would buy them! Any thoughts that the good people of this group have would be amazing to hear! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/peej5688"> /u/peej5688 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer/comments
