After these two screens it seems to crash during the &quot;preparing game&quot;. (if i have steam open it also does not open the game in heroic games!)</p> <p>I didnt know what else i could try, so my friend suggested trying to download it with the heroic games launcher instead. In heroic games im able to open the EA launcher fully, log in, and open the game. However, it now shows horrible flickering green lines in my screen.<br/> I havent tried much for this issue, as i simply have no idea what could be the cause. </p> <p>CPU: 8x Intel

However, the window immediately minimizes after launch and cannot be reopened. The audio still works fine though. I tried reenabling the shadercache, switching to Proton GE, rebooting and changing the launch config, without any result.
