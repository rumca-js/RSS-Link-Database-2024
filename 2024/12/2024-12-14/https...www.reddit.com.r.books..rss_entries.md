## Paradise Lost (John Milton, 1608-1674)

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So, I have been reading Paradise Lost by John Milton again for a while now, and I can fully say that I am enamored with this book. Ever since reading Milton a couple of years ago I have been captivated by his sheer prose and poetic works. Two years ago I bought Paradise Lost, a Poem that I&#39;ve grown to love and to place in the literary Parnassus along with Dante, Virgil, Ovid, Shakespeare and other major works of ancient and modern literature.</p> <p>Paradise Lost was written during a time of political and literary upheval in Britain (Civil War, execution of Charles I, rule of Lord Protector Cromwell over Britain until his death in 1658, the Restoration of King Charles II), and so many themes about Monarchy and Republicanism can be found in it. Milton composed this work when he was already blind (he became blind in 1652) with the help of friends and amanuenses, and he sold the rights of the poem in 1667 for only 10£ (Milton was severely impoverish

## The Long Walk by Stephen King

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Now, first I want to say the book is pretty good BUT I have one major, glaring issue with the book. The whole premise of the book is that these boys are walking for miles and miles and if they drop below a certain pace they get a warning. After three warnings the boy is shot and killed. Okay, that’s a great premise and I loved the execution of the story! Here’s my one issue….the walking pace is set to 4mph. For anyone who has been on a treadmill would soon find out, four miles per hour is a breakneck walk. In the book I am often picturing boys just barely shuffling along at the minimum speed, and some boys end up crawling for a time at the right speed!! I’m on a treadmill as I write this walking at a reasonable 3mph and the guy next to me is jogging at 4mph. I just remembered this main plot point in that book and how much it bothered me and apparently still bothers me. Unless Stephen King has an amazing walking pace, I don’t think he ever stepped on

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I always like to gift my parents a book for Christmas but it can be a challenge finding something they will enjoy that isn’t right wing propaganda. For reference they are very religious and conservative. They do like history. I gifted All the Light We Cannot See last year and they seemed to enjoy that. The Poisonwood Bible sounded interesting but I wanted to ask people who have read it, is it politically heavy handed? I only read the brief summary and I want to make sure I’m getting something that they will enjoy.

## I forget the books after I read them, and it makes me a bit frustrated

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>When someone brings this matter up, usually the following quote is posted: </p> <blockquote> <p>I cannot remember the books I&#39;ve read any more than the meals I have eaten; even so, they have made me.</p> </blockquote> <p>While I understand how perfectly natural and reasonable this phenomenon is, it still irks me from time to time. Isn&#39;t it quite irritable that, say, eight month after finishing a novel, I can recall only some vague details and general atmosphere, maybe one or two motifs? </p> <p>For example, the books I read about 2 years ago, that captivated me for weeks after I had finished them - <em>Les Miserables</em> by Victor Hugo, <em>The Idiot</em> by Dostoyevsky or <em>Solaris</em> by Stanislaw Lem - are now almost vanished from my memory, for I recount only their outline, some random impressions. I bet I couldn&#39;t speak about them for more than ten minutes if I were forbidden to make vague statements like &#39;the writing was ama

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>My son turned 6 this fall and this is the first really consistent year I&#39;ve spent reading chapter books with him. I&#39;ve looked at posts/comments from other parents about what good books are for the age group so I thought I&#39;d look back at my Goodreads and give a review informed by a 5/6 year old&#39;s perspective.</p> <p><strong>The BFG</strong> by Roald Dahl - The kid loved this. I found it unpleasant for reading aloud just for how many made up words there are, but it&#39;s fun.</p> <p><strong>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</strong> by Roald Dahl - This was probably the biggest hit. We&#39;ve been chasing this high all year. As an adult, you know if you are reading a book called &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; that Charlie Bucket is going to get one of those golden tickets. The joy and excitement on my kids face when he finally gets the ticket was a top 10 parenting moment. (Gene Wilder movie afterwards was also a hit.)</p

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am about to finish Infinite Jest, and I&#39;m thinking about what to read next. I think I&#39;ve narrowed it down to: 1) Count of Monte Cristo (I&#39;ve heard it&#39;s amazing, and, after IJ, I feel i have a tolerance and patience for another long book); 2) Stoner (I&#39;ve seen it mentioned here a lot lately); 3) Timequake (I&#39;ve been reading KV&#39;s novels in order along with the Unstuck in Time book, so this would be my last one, killing both books in one fell swoop); 4) Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass (I&#39;ve been reading Eldridge Cleaver and George Jackson and wanted to do a full study into this area of literature, so I thought I&#39;d start with the earliest stuff)</p> <p>Thoughts?
