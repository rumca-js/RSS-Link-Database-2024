One sometimes needs to use multiple models to get the desired result (or to crosscheck the initial result). What do you think where this will ultimately lead? Will one model finally be superior to others, creating or intensifying othe issues like data privacy? Will we keep the status quo, resulting in 3+ subscriptions we might need (because I think at some point companies will need to charge the broad mass of users to get enough returns on their invests).

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello everyone,<br/> I currently have a ChatGPT subscription, and I mostly use it to help with work that involves creating PowerShell scripts and Python programs. I also use ChatGPT alongside GitHub Copilot for additional coding assistance. However, I’ve been hearing that Claude is far superior to ChatGPT when it comes to helping with coding tasks, and I’m considering making the switch.</p> <p>The issue I’m facing is that I would love to keep my ChatGPT subscription and also get Cursor to use Claude within it. Unfortunately, Cursor doesn’t work with my company’s network because it&#39;s blocked. This leaves me in a bit of a dilemma on how to best proceed.</p> <p>I’m looking for suggestions on what I should do. Are there other AI-integrated IDEs like Cursor that would be a good fit for coding? I like GitHub Copilot, but it feels a bit sluggish compared to Cursor’s performance.</p> <p>In addition to work, I also have personal projects where I heavily r

Bolt on the other hand writes everything and seems way more advanced but it&#39;s always causing problems that it can&#39;t solve and when I manually write the code, it seems that it&#39;s still stuck.</p> <p>What are your opinions on both and why do you choose that one? They both have great pros but they both have bad cons. Bolt always can&#39;t solve its navigation or npm installations which makes me not want to use it anymore. Is anyone else having that issue? I know it&#39;s just bad simple misspelling or incorrect file name but when I fix it, it still doesn&#39;t work.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/VaguePenguin"> /u/VaguePen
