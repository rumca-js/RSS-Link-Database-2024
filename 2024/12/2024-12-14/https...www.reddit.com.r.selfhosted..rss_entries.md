Next I tried OpenMediaVault, it was better but maybe I‚Äôm using it wrong? </p> <p>What I‚Äôm looking for is a simple to use service, where I can attach 2 usb hard drives to my mini pc, without the need of reformatting them, and use ACL, and create SMB/SFTP shares to use with my devices and Infuse on Apple TV.</p> <p>Is OMV my simplest option?

Any help would be appreciated. TIA</p> <p>Edit: the VPN is through Proton, so I just have my whole connection tunneled through WG with the exception of my gaming PC. I would like to tunnel my gaming PC through WG as well,
