<p>Buzee is a file search application that helps you find your files effortlessly.<p>As a modern-day knowledge worker, I have several thousand documents, presentations and other files on my computer. I built Buzee in my free time to help me weave my way through this maze. I have been using it pretty much everyday since the day I built it - and I love it!<p>I thought I could turn Buzee into a startup. I reached out to offices and helped set it up for them. But it didn't pan out.<p>I am now letting go of this project because I have other priorities in life.<p>Please feel free to do with this project as you wish. I am happy to help you get started with the codebase.<p>Do share what you build. I would love to see it!<p>Cheers</p>

<p>Hi Hacker News,<p>I've created Chord Nebula, a simple web-based game designed to help users learn and practice piano chords, basic progressions, and harmony fundamentals. The game integrates with MIDI keyboards, allowing you to play chords in real-time and receive immediate feedback based on the key you choose.<p>GitHub Repository: 
<a href="https://github.com/yottanami/chord-nebula">https://github.com/yottanami/chord-nebula</a>
Live Demo: <a href="https://chords.yottanami.com" rel="nofollow">https://chords.yottanami.com</a><p>Requirements:
To use Chord Nebula, you'll need a MIDI keyboard connected to your computer.<p>Current Status:
Chord Nebula is still a simple project. I'm committed to improving it based on user feedback and would greatly appreciate any support or contributions from the community.<p>Looking for Feedback and Collaborators:
I'm eager to hear your thoughts on Chord Nebula! Whether it's suggestions for new features, improvements, or bug reports, your feedback is i

## Show HN: Svader – Create GPU-rendered Svelte components
 - [https://github.com/sockmaster27/svader](https://github.com/sockmaster27/svader)

<p>Svader is a library for rendering 2D shaders on Svelte websites, using either WebGL or WebGPU.<p>It's streamlined for the specific use case of rendering 2D graphics using fragment shaders as an alternative to SVG or the JS canvas API, so it's not meant for doing 3D objects like three.js, for example.<p>This started as something I needed for my own project, but I eventually decided to split it into a separate library. I've since found that this use case fits really well into the Svelte compiler-based approach and its fine-grained reactivity system.<p>In general, I think using shaders like these has some really positive upsides compared to traditional ways of doing graphics on the web — not just for games and stuff, but also for something like data visualizations and aesthetic details. My dream is that one day, you'll see web developers using small, isolated shader components ubiquitously across web applications, just as naturally as something like SVGs are used today.</p>

<p>I made a public transport route planning program that's capable of planning journeys across Europe or North America! There's only one other FOSS project I know of (MOTIS/Transitous) that can do transit routing at this scale, and in the testing I've performed mine is about 50x faster. I've spent a few weeks on this project now and it's getting to the point where I can show it off, but the API responses need a lot of work before they're usable for any downstream application.<p>Example query (Berlin to Barcelona): <a href="https://farebox.airmail.rs/plan/52.5176122,13.4180261/41.380458,2.1455451" rel="nofollow">https://farebox.airmail.rs/plan/52.5176122,13.4180261/41.380...</a><p>There are some bugs still. Notably, it's not capable of planning the return trip for this route, nor the reverse of the trip from Seattle to NYC that I gave in the blog post.<p>Blog post: <a href="https://blog.ellenhp.me/performant-intracontinental-transit-routing-in-rust" rel="nofollow">https://blog.ellenhp
