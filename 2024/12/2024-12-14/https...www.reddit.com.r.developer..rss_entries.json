They\u2019ve gotta be using some kind of caching layer (redis etc). And how do they manage to quickly send the chat context when you type something new? Honestly, I\u2019m clueless about how they\u2019re handling this. Anyone know what\u2019s going on behind the scenes? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/hopefull420\"> /u/hopefull420 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1he5cue/how_does_gpt_load_up_chats_so_fastly/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1he5cue/how_does_gpt_load_up_chats_so_fastly/\">[comments]</a></span>",
