I think the name of the book/series has something to do with either sand, blood, a blade, or something like that. I more than likely read this on kindle unlimited. </p> <p>One scene that I do remember is the mc is traveling across the desert and he gets stranded due to a sandstorm or something similar. He gets deliriously dehydrated, but gets saved by a passing caravan, which take him with them. </p> <p>Sorry if this isn‚Äôt a lot of information. I‚Äôve tried looking on kindle and good reads, but I haven‚Äôt had any luck. If there‚Äôs any questions or clarifications I need to make please comment.

We like the idea of there being an exchange, so it feels more immersive.
