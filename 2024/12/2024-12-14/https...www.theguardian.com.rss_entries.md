<p>This winter warmer is so much more than just a deep dive into one of the greatest festive tunes – it’s an astonishing tribute to the genius of George Michael</p><p>What a big-hearted winter warmer Wham: Last Christmas Unwrapped turns out to be. This hour-long special promises an in-depth look at one of the most successful Christmas songs of all time, though curiously, it wasn’t until 39 years after its initial release, in 1984, that it finally became Britain’s festive number one. Much like the podcast Song Exploder, this documentary pulls the song and the video apart, discussing how they were written and made, before analysing their cultural impact. All fascinating, particularly to fans, but even fans might be surprised at how intimate and lovely the conversations about George Michael are here.</p><p>You can tell this is going to be joyful from the off. While Last Christmas is the angel on top of the tree, this acts as a potted history of Wham! too, beginning in 1984, the year eve

Already severely depleted by injury, the Sharks’ options were further limited by the decision to leave stellar names such as Siya Kolisi, André Esterhuizen and Ox Nché at home.

## Diogo Jota rescues point for 10-man Liverpool to deny Fulham famous win

<p>In the cold light of a relentless title race Liverpool may consider this a disappointing draw. The reality of a gruelling assignment against Fulham, and the atmosphere inside Anfield, told otherwise. Down to 10 men after 16 minutes, and 2-1 down until the 85th minute, Arne Slot’s Premier League leaders fought, pressed and attacked until the very last. Victory eluded Liverpool, but the performance will sustain them.</p><p>Marco Silva’s dangerous team led twice through Andreas Pereira and substitute Rodrigo Muniz. They also had the advantage of seeing Andy Robertson sent off for denying Harry Wilson a goalscoring opportunity, but Fulham could not capitalise entirely. Cody Gakpo brought Liverpool level early in the second half before the fit-again Diogo Jota showed what Slot’s team have missed during his absence with another clinical strike. It was a breathless, absorbing fixture that both teams will think they should have won.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/d

<p>Inevitability is a dangerous sensation in football. Nothing is ever certain. No matter how great the general sense of domination, no matter how impressive the possession stats, at some point a team still has to go and actually put the ball in the net. For a long time on Saturday the sense was that Arsenal would score at some point. They had to. They had all the ball. They were only playing Everton. There were enough chances and half-chances to maintain the general feeling that a breakthrough would come. But it did not – and so, with Liverpool dropping points, another opportunity to close the gap at the top was missed.</p><p>For the second week in a row, Arsenal looked short of ideas against a side who sat deep and defended in numbers – even if they might think themselves unlucky not to have been awarded a penalty for Vitalii Mykolenko’s late lunge on Thomas Partey. It’s three and a half league games now since they scored from open play. It’s one thing to make a virtue of set-piece

<p>Only time will tell whether Ruud van Nistelrooy’s honeymoon as Leicester’s manager was ended or merely interrupted here. Equally it is still far too early to predict if this will come to be regarded as a turning point in Newcastle’s hitherto stuttering season but, after four games without a win, Eddie Howe’s players certainly succeeded in making a mockery of suggestions that he might be destined for the sack.</p><p>While Howe recently celebrated his third anniversary in charge at St James’ Park, Van Nistelrooy suffered his first defeat in three matches since taking the helm at Leicester. How the 48-year-old must have wished he was still wearing his old shooting boots rather than watching in increasing dismay from the edge of the technical area.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/dec/14/newcastle-leicester-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Sex and the City star says it is ‘the thrill of a life’ to be appointed to 2025 panel alongside Roddy Doyle, Kiley Reid and Ayọ̀bámi Adébáyọ̀ to pick year’s best novel</p><p>Her Cosmopolitan-sipping, Manolo-wearing, wise-cracking Carrie Bradshaw in Sex and the City was a generation-defining star turn. Now Sarah Jessica Parker has an unexpectedly cerebral new role, as a judge on next year’s Booker Prize.</p><p>Parker said it was “the thrill of a life” and “a golden ticket” to be appointed to the 2025 panel, which will be chaired by former winner Paddy Doyle. The actor, who earlier this year appeared on the London stage in the play Plaza Suite, has been quietly embedded in the literary world since becoming an editorial director at Hogarth in 2017, launching her own imprint, SJP Lit, with the independent publisher Zando in 2022.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/dec/14/sarah-jessica-parker-gets-a-golden-ticket-to-the-judging-panel-of-2025-booker-prize">Continue read

<p>The actor, 84, talks about memories of the Blitz, surviving through humour, the inspiration of Ronnie Barker and being knighted by the Queen</p><p><strong>Near the end </strong>of the Second World War, I must have been about four, and we were in a canvas shelter in my house with my mother and father. The bombs were dropping and I was getting frightened and my mother cuddled me and said: “It’s all right, don’t worry, it’s only God moving his furniture around”, and that put me at ease I’ve never forgotten that, and every time there’s a thunderstorm I always remember it and it just calms me down.</p><p><strong>As a young boy,</strong> humour was survival. I would have been about eight or nine when I met with a load of lads in a pretty tough area, and being very small and slight I had to work out how to not get beaten up. So I quickly observed that if you make somebody laugh, they’ll be more likely to become your friend than your enemy.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-

But it isn’t vegan (it uses six eggs). Many chefs and food writers have written recipes in homage to her Sephardic delight, and now it’s my turn. I’ve kept the boiling and blending bit, because it adds moisture and richness, a bright orange flavour and a slight (pleasant) bitterness, but I’ve replaced the almonds with flour, to bind, and added some cardamom, because it’s Christmas!</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/dec/14/vegan-whole-orange-and-cardamom-cake-christmas-recipe-meera-sodha">Continue reading...</a>

<p>I wear mine with T-shirts in summer, shirts in autumn, with sweaters now. Plus, they can make a great low-impact party outfit</p><p>It has been a mixed bag of a year, hasn’t it? Ups and downs, let’s say. That is probably the most positive spin on 2024. But when times are challenging, it is more important than ever to celebrate the small wins. And for me, one of the deep joys of this year has been rediscovering the absolute life-changing brilliance of having a pair of&nbsp;trousers that go with everything that you really like.</p><p>My favourite loose-leg trousers have been my north star this year.

Having gone to ground, Kerkez was surely at a disadvantage to beat Anthony Musaba to the punch?</p><p>“My teammate Tijjani Reijnders went: ‘No, no!’ I was like: ‘I have to do something,’” says the Bournemouth defender. So Kerkez, on his backside, scrambles towards the ball, throwing his body at it, twirling mid-air like a commando, to block and retain possession. “I wanted to hit it with my head but it came off my back.

<p>A writer takes his elderly mother on a road trip through the Swiss Alps in an attempt to break with his privileged family’s dysfunctional past</p><p>Christian Kracht is a Swiss novelist who writes in German. He has been publishing since 1995, when his debut Faserland won him favourable comparisons to Bret Easton Ellis and Nick Hornby. Despite Kracht’s high profile among German-language readers, Eurotrash is only the third of his novels to be translated into English. The first was 2012’s Imperium, inspired by the life of the historical figure August Engelhardt, an eccentric who founded a utopian cult in the South Seas based on sun worship and eating coconuts.</p><p>Eurotrash works a smaller, more personal canvas. It tells the story of a middle aged Swiss-German writer called Christian who wrote a novel called Faserland in the 1990s and now finds himself in Zurich, visiting his elderly mother.

<p>Red One is the latest Hollywood attempt at a spectacular festive action film. It is on course to lose $100m. Why don’t they realise we want slippers, jim-jams and Lindsay Lohan?</p><p>It’s the most wonderful time of the year – a time for carolling and concerts, trees and tinsel, mulled wine, open fires and, of course, The Rock (aka Dwayne Johnson). Or at least, that is, according to Hollywood. The action star’s latest film, Red One, has been playing in cinemas across the world since mid-November. But critically, it’s been regarded as a bit of a stinker.</p><p>For those who missed it, the film was conceived as the first instalment of a Christmas-themed action franchise. It casts Dwayne Johnson as Callum Drift, commander of the North Pole’s Enforcement Logistics and Fortification (ELF) division – Santa’s security team.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/dec/14/what-the-rocks-big-box-office-bomb-tells-us-about-our-needs-and-desires-at-christmas">Continue read

## I was a long-haired teenage boy in the 1960s. Why did everyone hate us so much?

<p>It wasn’t always clear why our buzz-cut parents felt so threatened by our cascading locks – but guys like me needed to express ourselves</p><p>Throughout the mid-to-late 60s, I had to fight every literal inch of the way over the matter of long hair. As I practised being Mick Jagger before the bedroom mirror, it was always on the understanding that, within hours, I might be in front of that same mirror after a parentally-dictated trip to the barber.</p><p>No amount of backcombing, pulling or applications of a thickening gel called Dippety-Do could disguise the brutal shearing. I’d be left making the best of a bad job, sprucing up for a Saturday night of raging pubescent hormones and perspiration.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/dec/14/i-was-a-long-haired-teenage-boy-in-the-1960s-why-did-everyone-hate-us-so-much">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Attack on several regions comes after Russia hammered Ukrainian energy facilities with drones and missiles. What we know on day 1,025</p><p><strong>Ukrainian drones made several strikes inside Russia overnight into Saturday, including an infrastructure facility storing fuel in central Russia’s Oryol region, sparking a fire and smashing windows in homes.</strong> The Oryol governor, Andrei Klychkov, said early on Saturday that a “mass attack” on an infrastructure site caused fuel to catch fire. The governor of Krasnodar region, Vladimir Kondratyev, said air defences destroyed Ukrainian drones in several areas of the region south and east of Ukraine. One drone smashed windows in village houses, but there were no injuries. Air defences destroyed seven drones over Bryansk region on Ukraine’s northern border, said the governor, Alexander Bogomaz. And in Russia’s Belgorod region, the governor, Vyacheslav Gladkov, said Ukrainian strikes hit two villages, injuring one resident and trigger

<p>Sadly for UK viewers, this is not a sexy reboot of one of our greatest film franchises. All the roles in it, however, have their equivalents</p><p>For vulgar-minded Brits, a Hollywood film title sometimes carries its own unintended associations and unfortunate resonances. Many were pained at the raucous response from some here in 2017 to the title of Robert Redford’s earnest film <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/sep/01/our-souls-at-night-review-robert-redford-jane-fonda-romance-kent-haruf">Our Souls at Night</a>. Now here is a moderate new piece of Netflix product, a thriller about a bomb smuggled on to a plane in hand-baggage, starring Taron Egerton as Ethan, the airport security officer in a tense situation and Jason Bateman as the sinister explosives mastermind. It’s called … Carry-On.</p><p>That title is self-explanatory for everyone in the United States. But it’s bound to get British Netflix subscribers very overexcited, assuming as they surely will that the gre

## Experience: I was viciously attacked by a group of otters

<p>The attack was relentless – there were 10 otters in all, tearing my arms, my legs, even the back of my scalp</p><p>I started running three years ago as part of my daily fitness routine. After dropping my son&nbsp;off at school each morning, I’d head to Perdana Park, near my home in Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia, for a warmup. The park offered a perfect space for peaceful reflection at the start of the day.</p><p>One morning in early September, just after my run, I was surprised to spot a group of otters crossing the parking lot. I couldn’t resist capturing the moment on video, marvelling at how endearing these small creatures seemed. It was the first time I had seen otters in the park and I sent the video to my friends, gushing about how adorable they were. Little did I realise that that footage would soon go viral for reasons I couldn’t have anticipated.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/dec/14/experience-i-was-viciously-attacked-by-a-group-of-otters">Continue
