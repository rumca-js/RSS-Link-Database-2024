They allow you to easily build IoT solutions to solve problems \"normal\" computers are not designed for. Whether you want to build a battery powered server, a testing device with a built in screen, or a robot a Pi is probably your best choice.\n\nThere are number of versions of the Pi and we will discuss what they are and what you need to think about before buying them.\n\nWe will explain how to install the PiOS, what it is and how to configure it.\n\nWe'll explain GPIO Pins and how to communicate with them.\n\nAnd basically geek out over this fabulous resource that anyone can buy and use.\n\nThe class wil",
