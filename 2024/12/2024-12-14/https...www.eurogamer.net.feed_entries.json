The standard game ships with a form of ray-traced global illumination, but Machine Games has gone one step further for the PC version, delivering a <em>full</em> ray tracing upgrade. This turns an already great-looking game into an even better one, often bridging the gap between RTGI and full offline rendering. It has its limitations - which we'll go into - but overall, it's a spectacular upgrade. Yes, it can be demanding on hardware, but you can still enjoy the lion's share of the benefits on RTX 4070-class hardware at 1440p resolution.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.",

Welcome back to our regular feature where we write a little bit about some of the games we've been playing over the past few days. This week, we admire temporary rule-changes in a game, we play a real-life advent calendar somehow, and we push to the end of a long fantasy adventure.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/what-weve-been-playing-advent-calendars-tricksy-trials-and-ages-of-dragons\">Read more</a></p>",
