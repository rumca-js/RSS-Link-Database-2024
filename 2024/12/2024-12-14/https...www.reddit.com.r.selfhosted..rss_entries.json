Is this a good approach? If so, how can I restrict access to the API endpoints (example.com/api/) so they\u2019re not publicly accessible (e.g., no direct access to the browsable API) while keeping everything functional in production? What\u2019s the best practice for this setup?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/tepa6aut\"> /u/tepa6aut </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1hdtj3r/dockerized_nginx_django_nextjs/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1hdtj3r/dockerized_nginx_django_nextjs/\">[comments]</a></span>",
