<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey all, I have an a2k with a pistorm2k and pulling my hair out trying to get it working.</p> <p>I bought a pre-built sd card for the storm, the instructions for setting it up are confusing as hell to me...</p> <pre><code>1. First of all, backup your microSD card! For instance with the ‚ÄúUSB Image Tool‚Äù app 2. Copy all ADF files from the AmigaOS32CD:ADF folder to the microSD card‚Äôs BOOT:+AmigaOS32 folder. Use an OS that can read FAT32 partitions &amp; write to them This has me puzzled, Copy all adf files from WHERE??? The SD card has a AmigaOS32CD folder, but its empty... and then, TO WHERE? my sd card doesn&#39;t have a &quot;BOOT&quot; directory. </code></pre> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Radamand"> /u/Radamand </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1hdskxg/need_some_help_setting_up_my_pistorm2k/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/com
