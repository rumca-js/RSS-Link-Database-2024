<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Forgive me, but I&#39;m new at setting up an RSS feed, and I&#39;m trying to create a feed with Zapier for my <a href="http://Start.me">Start.me</a> home page. At the moment, I&#39;m stuck at the point where Zapier doesn&#39;t like my feed URL, which looks good to me <a href="https://zapier.com/engine/rss/#######/">https://zapier.com/engine/rss/#######/</a> Any help will be appreciated.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>For RSS feeds for podcasts . . .</p> <p>Why does every RSS feed I have found redundantly show the tags of itunes:author and itunes:explicit at both the channel level and in every single episode?</p> <p>If the itunes:author is &quot;Jane Smith Studios&quot; and an individual episode has no changes to that, then why does the RSS feed show the tag itunes:author in the channel <em>and also again</em> in the item?</p> <p>When there is no change from channel to item for the image or the location, then we do <em>not</em> repeat that identical info for each individual item (episode).</p> <p>But!</p> <p>For some reason, a channel with the same author at both the channel (series) level and episods level for every episode will repeat that information.</p> <p>The case is the same for itunes:explicit. If my channel (series) is clean, then the channel tag for itunes:explicit is false. Yet every episode re-declares that the episode is also clean.</p> <p>Why repeat

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>For years, I have used the free version of Feedly to get my news via RSS. This still works great, but I am finding that many newer websites don&#39;t have RSS feeds. </p> <p>Feedly does have a good feature that will generate an RSS feed from the website so I can read the articles in the reader, but it is a paid feature.</p> <p>I am not averse to paying for a tool that provides this service, but if I am going to upgrade to a paid RSS reader, it makes sense to look at the alternatives and choose an RSS reader that may have additional useful features for the same price or less.</p> <p>So my question is: What Android RSS reader would you recommend that creates RSS feeds on websites without RSS so I can follow ALL the sources I want to keep informed with? And what do you like about it?</p> <p>Thank you for your help.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/CaptainTime"> /u/CaptainTime </a> <br/> <span><a href
