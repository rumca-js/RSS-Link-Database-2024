In today's Daily Fix:
Last night's The Game Awards dropped several huge reveals: the first trailer for The Witcher 4, a trailer for a new Naughty Dog game—Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, and a new Elden Ring game. Elden Ring: Nightreign will be a multiplayer-focused action game that takes the main experience and tosses roguelike, pvp, and pve elements into one pot. While there's no release date yet, there will be an upcoming closed network test and we'll tell you where you can sign up. As leaks and teases have revealed recently, The Witcher 4 will be Ciri's show, but Geralt will have a role to play. And finally, Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet is a new IP from Naughty Dog and looks to be different from their groundbreaking The Last of Us games in practically every way.
