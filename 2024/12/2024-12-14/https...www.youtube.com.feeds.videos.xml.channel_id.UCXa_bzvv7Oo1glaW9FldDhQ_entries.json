        "description": "I wanted to give The Spirit of the Samurai a fair shake, mostly due to its visuals but because three unlikely allies teaming up to fight a nigh-unstoppable army seemed appealing. Between unresponsive controls, visual issues, tedious item collecting, random combat, awkward movement, and an underwhelming narrative, there are very few redeeming qualities. \n\nIf you're truly bent on picking it up, even on a discount, you might want to wait for patches and quality-of-life improvements first. Even then, given the short runtime, it's almost impossible to recommend.",

        "description": "The Game Awards 2024 were packed with a surprising number of major announcements, and among them,\u00a0The Witcher 4\u00a0was easily one of the brightest highlights. Nearly a decade ago, CD Projekt RED became a games industry household name with the seminal\u00a0The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, and now, the developer has formally, officially unveiled the next instalment in the franchise. \n\nPresumably, it's going to be a while before the action RPG releases, but even though it has only just been announced, and even though we've seen zero gameplay for it, we already do know a handful of interesting details about\u00a0The Witcher 4. For your convenience, here, we've compiled them in one place.",
