Most required me to fine-tune an existing model and would have taken a $5k/month AWS EC2 instance with A100 or better NVIDIA GPUs to run lol. So, I built a simple one to detect pagination elements on web pages in 5 days.</p> <p>I collected and cleaned 500k web pages data using a heuristic from common crawl and then trained a PyTorch neural net (~4k parameters) to classify pagination elements on a web page:<br/> 1) Next page</p> <p>2) Prev page</p> <p>3) Jump to page</p> <p>4) None</p> <p>I&#39;ve gotten pretty fantastic results so far with text based buttons, but I&#39;m finding more pages that used image based pagination buttons. I need to improve the encoder speed Does anyone know:</p> <p>1) Of large datasets that have well &quot;action&quot; based-labeled html s",
