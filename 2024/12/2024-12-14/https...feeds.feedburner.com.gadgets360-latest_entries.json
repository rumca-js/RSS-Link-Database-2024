        "description": "A humpback whale has been tracked on an unprecedented 8,000-mile migration, breaking records for the longest documented journey between breeding grounds. Scientists suggest the movement might be due to climate change affecting food and mating behaviours. AI-driven photo tracking through HappyWhale.com played a key role in identifying the whale\u2019s unique route across the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans. These findings offer new insights into how marine species are adapting to environmental changes.",

This rare discovery showcases a galaxy similar in mass to the Milky Way during its early years. Unprecedented details were revealed using gravitational lensing and infrared imaging, highlighting 10 distinct star clusters within Firefly Sparkle. Close companion galaxies may influence its mass growth. The findings provide valuable insights into galactic evolution and star formation processes in the universe's infancy.",

        "description": "NASA's latest findings indicate that Jupiter's volcanic moon Io does not have a global magma ocean beneath its surface, debunking previous theories. This conclusion comes from analysis of data from NASA's Juno spacecraft and archival observations from the Galileo mission. The study suggests that Io's interior is more solid than expected, with volcanic activity driven by localised pockets of molten rock rather than a continuous magma ocean. Tidal heating from Jupiter's gravitational pull and interactions with neighbouring moons like Europa and Ganymede supplies the necessary energy to fuel these volcanic eruptions.",
