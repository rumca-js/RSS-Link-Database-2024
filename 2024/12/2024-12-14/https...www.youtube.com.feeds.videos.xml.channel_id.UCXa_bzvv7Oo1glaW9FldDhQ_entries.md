I wanted to give The Spirit of the Samurai a fair shake, mostly due to its visuals but because three unlikely allies teaming up to fight a nigh-unstoppable army seemed appealing. Between unresponsive controls, visual issues, tedious item collecting, random combat, awkward movement, and an underwhelming narrative, there are very few redeeming qualities. 

If you're truly bent on picking it up, even on a discount, you might want to wait for patches and quality-of-life improvements first. Even then, given the short runtime, it's almost impossible to recommend.
