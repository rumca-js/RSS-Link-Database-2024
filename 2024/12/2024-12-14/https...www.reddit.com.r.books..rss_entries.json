Ever since reading Milton a couple of years ago I have been captivated by his sheer prose and poetic works. Two years ago I bought Paradise Lost, a Poem that I&#39;ve grown to love and to place in the literary Parnassus along with Dante, Virgil, Ovid, Shakespeare and other major works of ancient and modern literature.</p> <p>Paradise Lost was written during a time of political and literary upheval in Britain (Civil War, execution of Charles I, rule of Lord Protector Cromwell over Britain until his death in 1658, the Restoration of King Charles II), and so many themes about Monarchy and Republicanism can be found in it. Milton composed this work when he was already blind (he became blind in 1652) with the help of friends and amanuenses, and he sold the rights of the poem in 1667 for only 10\u00a3 (Milton was severely impoverish",

The whole premise of the book is that these boys are walking for miles and miles and if they drop below a certain pace they get a warning. After three warnings the boy is shot and killed. Okay, that\u2019s a great premise and I loved the execution of the story! Here\u2019s my one issue\u2026.the walking pace is set to 4mph. For anyone who has been on a treadmill would soon find out, four miles per hour is a breakneck walk. In the book I am often picturing boys just barely shuffling along at the minimum speed, and some boys end up crawling for a time at the right speed!! I\u2019m on a treadmill as I write this walking at a reasonable 3mph and the guy next to me is jogging at 4mph. I just remembered this main plot point in that book and how much it bothered me and apparently still bothers me. Unless Stephen King has an amazing walking pace, I don\u2019t think he ever stepped on ",

I&#39;ve looked at posts/comments from other parents about what good books are for the age group so I thought I&#39;d look back at my Goodreads and give a review informed by a 5/6 year old&#39;s perspective.</p> <p><strong>The BFG</strong> by Roald Dahl - The kid loved this. I found it unpleasant for reading aloud just for how many made up words there are, but it&#39;s fun.</p> <p><strong>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</strong> by Roald Dahl - This was probably the biggest hit. We&#39;ve been chasing this high all year. As an adult, you know if you are reading a book called &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; that Charlie Bucket is going to get one of those golden tickets. The joy and excitement on my kids face when he finally gets the ticket was a top 10 parenting moment. (Gene Wilder movie afterwards was also a hit.)</p",
