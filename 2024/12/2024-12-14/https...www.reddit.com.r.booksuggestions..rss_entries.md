<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been looking for a book with the same vibes as Dark Souls games, mostly 3. A mostly epic but also dark fantasy book. You know - medieval, magic, religions, monsters, all that good stuff.</p> <p>Even though i&#39;m a huge fan of Lovecraft, i&#39;m looking for something more epic (ds3) than gloomy (bloodborne). Although i wont say no if you have a really good - plain dark fantasy - book to suggest; something like bloodborne.</p> <p>Any suggestions?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/CretanExecutive"> /u/CretanExecutive </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1hefkwi/dark_souls_3_epicdarkfantasy_type_of_book/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1hefkwi/dark_souls_3_epicdarkfantasy_type_of_book/">[comments]</a></span>

## Recommendations for books that study the hag trope in mythology/folklore

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m writing a story about hags and witches and have been trying RELENTLESSLY to find books or essays or anything that examines the trope of hags in history/mythology/folklore. Also interested in crones and witches, as the title states, but hags are really my central focus.</p> <p>I went into this expecting a dearth of information and have been really surprised to see a lot of the stuff I&#39;ve found so far is not really readily available - this seems like a feminist topic a lot of people would have studied already? But a lot of what I&#39;ve found that goes in depth about hags has been D&amp;D related, and while that&#39;s helpful in its own right I&#39;m kind of looking for all different examples of hags to study.</p> <p>I AM looking specifically for writings that examine hags through a gender study/theory lens but I&#39;m open to anything I can get at this point.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi, I&#39;ve recently been getting back into reading so, I must admit, I feel rather inadequate trying to decide what to take up.</p> <p>The two recent pieces of media that I have enjoyed greatly were Disco Elysium and Interview With The Vampire show on AMC. I really appreciated the prose in both of them, the exploration of character writing, well placed humour and some philosophical questions raised in those stories. I was tempted to take up Anne Rice&#39;s series after watching the show but a lot of things I have heard about it seem very conflicting and I have come to a conclusion that most of the changes done in the show have smoothed out the rough edges from the book series. So I guess what I&#39;m looking for is something like Vampire Chronicles but a little better? I am not above enjoying some purple prose but I&#39;d like the material to be more or less equally poignant and indulgent, I suppose. </p> <p>There is no specific theme I am looking

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>HI!! I&#39;m due on a long-haul flight tomorrow (12+ hours) and will be pre-downloading multiple books as I&#39;m not a fan of watching movies with a tiny screen barely millimeters from your face. </p> <p>I will be downloading The Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide (Adams; sci-fi), The Metamorphosis (Kafka; absurdist), Ninth House (Bardugo; fantasy), Games Untold (Barnes; YA mystery) and Atlas Shrugged (Rand; philosophical). I am nearing the end of Two Twisted Crowns which is a gothic fantasy and am searching for a book that is gripping, a contrast with the others on the list, easy to get into and not over 500 pages to start off the reading binge for the flight. </p> <p>It would preferably be sci-fi/fantasy and not as complicated as a classic - I am thinking the likes of Project Hail Mary, Six of Crows, City of Bones, The Hunger Games or Caraval! I&#39;m currently leaning towards Red Rising but feel as though the story is spoiled as I came across Red Queen first

I was wondering if anyone has any suggestions but it also has to be appropriate for her because her mom will definitely see it and I don’t want her to think I’m crazy for giving her daughter something inappropriate. Also my mom will see it. I’ve already gotten her some thing’s so the most I can spend on it is 15 dollars without going over the limit. Maybe I can push it by 5 dollars.

Completely platonic for a good amount of time. Then they start becoming actual friends, sharing their joys and their sadness with each other. They help each other heal. Then one of them, preferably the guy, starts to fall for the girl. And then we can see how the climax ensues.</p> <p>Oh I definitely don&#39;t want any YA, it&#39;s too tropey and I keep thinking how the hell did this kid get access to a helicopter and when do they do their homework</p> <p>Is there a book like this?</p> <p>P.s.am I being way too specific?!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/alex_rousseau"> /u/alex_rousseau </a> <br

I pondered sentience and what makes a human, and when individual suffering outweighs a greater good. </p> <p>I’d recommend it (with a strong content warning for violence) if you enjoyed :</p> <p>Blindsight - Peter Watts </p> <p>I have no mouth and I must scream - Harlan Ellison</p> <p>Tender is the flesh - Agustina Bazterrica</p> <p>Labyrinths - Jorge Luis Borges (not similar at all, but in my brain related for exploring some super cool ideas about physical reality and time) </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/

A series which I only found because the author wrote crossover fanfiction of it with the web novel Worm.</p> <p>Other similar series I also loved were the Reckoners by Brandon Sanderson, and the Please Don&#39;t Tell My Parents I&#39;m a Supervillain books (though I&#39;m not sure how these hold up now that I&#39;m older).</p> <p>I&#39;ve loved this sort of genre for a while and I want to find more of it to read. I already looked at some previous posts on this sub and came upon Hench, which I read through in a single day.</p> <p>Almost all of the books I listed feature (super)villain protagonists, or at least people opposing supers in the case of Reckoners and Hench.

Based off books I&#39;ve read in the past, I think I&#39;ve mostly liked fiction books, especially emotional ones. Although I&#39;m happy to try other genres, just not romance simply because I&#39;m not much of a fan of it. Thankyou!!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Patient-Star-5785"> /u/Patient-Star-5785 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1hdyrqm/whats_some_good_starter_books_that_arent_romance/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1hdyrqm/whats_some_good_starter_books_that_arent_romance/">[comments]</a></span>

## Looking for Books Like Stella Maris—That Patient-Physician Dynamic

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So, I’ve been re-reading Stella Maris—probably 5 or 6 times now—and I’m absolutely in love with it in every sense. The depth, the bleak introspection, the razor-sharp intellect of the narrator… it just hits in a way that few books ever do.</p> <p>One thing I can’t stop thinking about is that unique dynamic between the patient and the physician—the stark vulnerability, the philosophical back-and-forth, the rawness of someone laying their mind bare while another tries to untangle it. It’s such an intimate and unsettling relationship, especially when it’s paired with that kind of abstract, cerebral storytelling.</p> <p>So now I’m on the hunt for books that evoke a similar vibe. I’m not just looking for “therapy” settings, but ones that capture that heavy, existential dialogue and the nuanced power imbalance that comes with the patient-physician setup. Bonus points if the writing leans towards the dark, the intellectual, or the painfully self-aware.</p>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’m looking for thrillers and literary fiction. It doesn’t have to be scary or spooky. I actually don’t read horror. I enjoy authors like Lina Wolff. </p> <p>But I’m looking for books where the main character(s) are unreliable, possibly morally grey, and confuse the reader. Looking for books with open-ended endings caused by questionable actions of the character(s)/narrator. </p> <p>Im okay if they’re motivated by serious mental health issues or commit crimes. Just looking for more insight into the human brains of characters who have a disgusting inner turmoil but lead a life (and the story) in a deliberate way for personal gain without remorse or consideration of most characters. </p> <p>Possibly something not too long. (No science fiction length kind of books) </p> <p>Also, I don’t want to read any terrible written romance that glorifies sexual abuse. </p> <p>Thank you!! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone! I&#39;m not really sure how to explain this because I never really read books but I&#39;m looking for a sad book where the writer in depth explains emotions and the character&#39;s thought process, maybe something like „No Longer Human&quot; by Osamu Dazai. That&#39;s basically the kind of book I&#39;m looking for but a little more direct, like it has sentences that you could find in a poem. Preferably about the feeling of loneliness. Thank you in advance :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/-wolfyx-"> /u/-wolfyx- </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1hdrggh/book_that_focuses_on_thoughts_and_feelings/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1hdrggh/book_that_focuses_on_thoughts_and_feelings/">[comments]</a></span>

## Literary Fiction set in Ancient Rome

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a big history guy so novels set in Ancient Rome are like catnip for me. I just started Gore Vidal&#39;s Julian and am loving it so far and have previously read I Claudius, Memoirs of Hadrian, and (one of my favorite novels of all time) Augustus by John Williams. I also have a copy of Robert Harris&#39; Imperium, which I haven&#39;t yet gotten around to yet but look forward to.</p> <p>I&#39;m not a stickler for historical accuracy. If I wanted that there are plenty of great historians and classicists I can go to for that. What is important is that the book has a distinct worldview and authorial voice, rich themes and characterizations, a vibrant prose style with aesthetics serving the emotions and ideas of the story... Ya know, a good literary novel. But set in Rome.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/No_Road_6737"> /u/No_Road_6737 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksugges

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello, my son has asked me to get him a book for Chistmas and id like to get him something awesome as his interest in books is waning somewhat.</p> <p>The problem is, the ones I think will be okay turn out to be either a bit too gory or they&#39;re a bit too childish.</p> <p>I read him Matthew Reilly&#39;s Contest and that was pretty perfect. It had monsters, an easy to follow story and lots of action.</p> <p>I thought about another Matthew Reilly book but the rest tend to be human Vs human whereas ideally he&#39;d like something fantastical instead.</p> <p>Thanks for any recommendations.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/FlibV1"> /u/FlibV1 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1hdqafb/suggestion_for_an_action_book_for_a_14_year_old/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1hdqafb/suggestion_for_an_action_book_f

## Just finished “The Demon of Unrest” - looking for more

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I just finished Erik Larson’s “The Demon of Unrest.” While it was a slog at times, I kept going because I felt like I was learning something. Of course it focuses on Sumter and basically ends after it’s surrendered, and now I’d like to continue reading more about the U.S. Civil War. There are probably thousands of books, but I’m looking for “the next chapter”, so to speak. The book doesn’t have to cover the whole war, necessarily. I’d rather keep taking it a chunk at a time, like “Demon” did. Any suggestions? Thanks. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/DockmasterSC"> /u/DockmasterSC </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1hdq7un/just_finished_the_demon_of_unrest_looking_for_more/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1hdq7un/just_finished_the_demon_of_unrest_looking_for_more/">[comments]</a></span>
