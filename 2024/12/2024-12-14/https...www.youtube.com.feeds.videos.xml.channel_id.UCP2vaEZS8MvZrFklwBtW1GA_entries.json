        "description": "Bathroom exhaust fan tips\u2026I have to replace an old exhaust fan. The new fan is Panasonic\u2019s Whisper Cozy. This fan improves the indoor air quality because it removes humid air that causes mold and mildew. It also has a heater, which is terrific for cold bathrooms in the winter. Heating the space and ventilating moisture outside are two ways to keep the air clean and healthy for people with respiratory problems. Many thanks to @panasonic for providing the Whisper Cozy for my clients and sponsoring this project \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\udd25#exhaustfan #panasonic #bathroominspiration #brandpartner",
