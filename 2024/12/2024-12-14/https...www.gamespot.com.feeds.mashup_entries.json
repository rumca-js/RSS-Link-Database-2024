The movie was animated by anime studio Sola Digital Arts, and features several production alums from Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit trilogies, including producer and co-writer Philippa Boyens, who also co-wrote the screenplays for Jackson's films.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The War of the Rohirrim is based on writing found in the appendices of The Lord of the Rings. Specifically, it focuses on the kingdom of Rohan and its best-known ruler, Helm Hammerhand (voiced by Brian Cox). King Hammerhand's reign coincided with the war against the people of D\u00fanedain. The war with Dunlending raiders for control of the kingdom is the central conflict in the anime. Helm's Deep, the site of a pivotal battle in The Two Towers, gets its name from Hammerhand.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The War of the Rohirrim just released in theaters Dece",
