Raspberry Pi's are amazing low cost, "low power" computing options. They allow you to easily build IoT solutions to solve problems "normal" computers are not designed for. Whether you want to build a battery powered server, a testing device with a built in screen, or a robot a Pi is probably your best choice.

There are number of versions of the Pi and we will discuss what they are and what you need to think about before buying them.

We will explain how to install the PiOS, what it is and how to configure it.

We'll explain GPIO Pins and how to communicate with them.

And basically geek out over this fabulous resource that anyone can buy and use.
