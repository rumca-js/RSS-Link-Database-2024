The guardrails are too strict, its writing style is poor, and it&#39;s not good at helping me re-write things while retaining my tone and intentions. Sometimes it completely alters the concept of what I&#39;m trying to say. ChatGPT 4o is good, but it&#39;s a paid service. The free version, 4o mini, feels significantly less capable. Copilot&#39;s chat is okay, but I am simply BLOWN AWAY by Gemini Experimental 1206 on the AI Studio website.</p> <p>Yes, it takes some time to generate replies, but the responses are leagues better. Its level of &quot;understanding&quot; seems vastly superior to the other major LLMs I&#39;m used to, to the point that I rarely bother with them anymore. It&#39;s a much better collaborative tool, and its outputs feel less generic and more human, somehow.</p> <p>We often see posts here, or in many other subreddits, about how AI has degraded in some way, or about moral dilemmas sur
