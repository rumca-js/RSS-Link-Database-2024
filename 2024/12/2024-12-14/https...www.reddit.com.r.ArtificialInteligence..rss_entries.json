The one and only thing I want to achieve is that the faces must stay same at each image generated. Sorry if this sounds like a dumb question.

I would compare it to the streaming providers: First there was Netflix, I think ChatGPT would be the equivalent. Later there were Amazon and many more each having their own specialities and focus areas. Same now with AI models. One sometimes needs to use multiple models to get the desired result (or to crosscheck the initial result). What do you think where this will ultimately lead? Will one model finally be superior to others, creating or intensifying othe issues like data privacy? Will we keep the status quo, resulting in 3+ subscriptions we might need (because I think at some point companies will need to charge the broad mass of users to get enough returns on their invests).
