This hour-long special promises an in-depth look at one of the most successful Christmas songs of all time, though curiously, it wasn\u2019t until 39 years after its initial release, in 1984, that it finally became Britain\u2019s festive number one. Much like the podcast Song Exploder, this documentary pulls the song and the video apart, discussing how they were written and made, before analysing their cultural impact. All fascinating, particularly to fans, but even fans might be surprised at how intimate and lovely the conversations about George Michael are here.</p><p>You can tell this is going to be joyful from the off. While Last Christmas is the angel on top of the tree, this acts as a potted history of Wham! too, beginning in 1984, the year eve",

The reality of a gruelling assignment against Fulham, and the atmosphere inside Anfield, told otherwise. Down to 10 men after 16 minutes, and 2-1 down until the 85th minute, Arne Slot\u2019s Premier League leaders fought, pressed and attacked until the very last. Victory eluded Liverpool, but the performance will sustain them.</p><p>Marco Silva\u2019s dangerous team led twice through Andreas Pereira and substitute Rodrigo Muniz. They also had the advantage of seeing Andy Robertson sent off for denying Harry Wilson a goalscoring opportunity, but Fulham could not capitalise entirely. Cody Gakpo brought Liverpool level early in the second half before the fit-again Diogo Jota showed what Slot\u2019s team have missed during his absence with another clinical strike. It was a breathless, absorbing fixture that both teams will think they should have won.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/d",

There were enough chances and half-chances to maintain the general feeling that a breakthrough would come. But it did not \u2013 and so, with Liverpool dropping points, another opportunity to close the gap at the top was missed.</p><p>For the second week in a row, Arsenal looked short of ideas against a side who sat deep and defended in numbers \u2013 even if they might think themselves unlucky not to have been awarded a penalty for Vitalii Mykolenko\u2019s late lunge on Thomas Partey.

After studying drama at Manchester Polytechnic, Eclair began standup in the 1980s, and in 1995 became the first female solo comic to win the Perrier award, now the Edinburgh comedy award. Her career since has been prolific: comedy tours, writing and hosting for TV, radio and podcasts, as well as publishing six novels. She lives in London with her husband Geof Powell; her daughter is the playwright Phoebe Eclair-Powell.
