<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Been wondering how ChatGPT loads old chats so fast. Like, they can’t be pulling that directly from the database, right? They’ve gotta be using some kind of caching layer (redis etc). And how do they manage to quickly send the chat context when you type something new? Honestly, I’m clueless about how they’re handling this. Anyone know what’s going on behind the scenes? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/hopefull420"> /u/hopefull420 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1he5cue/how_does_gpt_load_up_chats_so_fastly/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1he5cue/how_does_gpt_load_up_chats_so_fastly/">[comments]</a></span>
