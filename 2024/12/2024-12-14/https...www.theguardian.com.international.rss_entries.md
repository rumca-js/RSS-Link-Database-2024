<p>The laid-back 17-year-old who brought millions of young fans to darts has been shortlisted for the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award</p><p>In a puritanical age of wellness, non-alcoholic drinks and going to the gym, an unlikely sport is thriving: darts. On Sunday the World Darts Championship returns to Alexandra Palace in north London, and in its wake throngs of young people dressed as<strong> </strong>gnomes and traffic cones drinking beer and breaking into song. And at the very centre of this culture stands a kebab-loving hero for our times – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/luke-littler">Luke “the Nuke” Littler</a>.</p><p>Littler has had an extraordinary year. In January, as a barely known 16-year-old, he was runner-up in the world championship. As the Warrington teenager progressed through the heats, huge numbers of fans began to watch, eventually reaching a record high of <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/darts/67884690#:~:text=The%20TV%20audience%20for%20

<p>Georges Simenon’s pipe-smoking, trenchcoat-clad, shabby sleuth has been given a Parisian makeover</p><p>A body left to rot under forest leaves, a dagger between the ribs, a bullet fired at the temple – this sort of slaughter is now commonplace on Sunday afternoon television, with viewers barely raising an eyebrow. But there are still some fictional crimes that can shock an audience, prompting letters and complaints. These are screen offences committed against a beloved detective, and they are perpetrated whenever a new version is made.</p><p>Fans of Sherlock Holmes, Van der Valk, Arsène Lupin, Marple or Poirot are regularly outraged when faced with a fresh, modernised portrayal. But among the most protective are the admirers of Georges Simenon’s celebrated Maigret novels – and they now have a big surprise coming their way. Their favourite middle-aged Parisian police chief is about to be reborn as a young, contemporary hero.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/dec/1

<p>A pair of boys try to survive the horrors of a US reform school during the segregated 60s in this Pulitzer-winning novel</p><p>Colson Whitehead’s Pulitzer prize-winning novel opens with&nbsp;the dreadful discovery of human bones in Florida, at a site slated for a new shopping mall. Decades earlier, the land had been home to the&nbsp;Nickel Academy, a prison reform school in the Jim Crow era where Black boys had been brutalised and, in some cases, murdered by staff.</p><p>The story then shifts back to the early 1960s and tells of Elwood Curtis, a hard-working boy who has been raised by his grandmother and who, inspired by Martin Luther King, has ambitions to lift himself out of his modest beginnings and do something great. But circumstances conspire to keep him down when he is accused of stealing a car and sent to the Nickel Academy for indefinite detention, a place where boys are taken “out back” and often don’t return.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/dec/14/th

<p>With its calming tropical vibe, this plant will be happy anywhere it is free to grow undisturbed</p><p><strong>Why will I love it?</strong><br>
 With its long, slightly wavy leaves drooping gracefully from slender branches, the banana leaf fig (<em>Ficus alii</em>) gives a home a calming tropical vibe. It is more forgiving and easygoing than its <em>Ficus</em> relatives.</p><p><strong>Light or shade?</strong><br>
 It thrives in bright, indirect light but can also tolerate lower light levels, making it versatile for different areas of your home.
