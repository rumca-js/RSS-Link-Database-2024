I colorized, restored, and added sound design to this 1938 film of Ottawa, Canada, showcasing the city's rich history and landmarks. It delves into why Ottawa became the capital, including the construction of the Rideau Canal. The film features aerial views of iconic locations like the Centre Block, Rideau Hall, and the Chateau Laurier, alongside vibrant social scenes, recreational activities, and scenic spots, presenting a comprehensive view of Ottawa's evolution.

Video Restoration Process:
✔ FPS boosted to 60 frames per second 
✔ Image resolution boosted up to HD 
✔ Improved video sharpness and brightness 
✔ Colorized only for the ambiance (not historically accurate)
