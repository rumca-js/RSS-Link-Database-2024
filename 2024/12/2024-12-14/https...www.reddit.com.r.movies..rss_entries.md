<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I will preface this post with something positive before I discuss my concerns. The truth is that as long as there are fans of art there will be people who will properly preserve it. If you want a movie in a particular form/ cut, with the original theatrical audio mix, with every special feature ever released for that movie, and in the best/ least compressed presentation possible then there are many places online where you can access it. This post isn&#39;t referring to crazy people like me that will seek out that material. This post is aimed at people that I refer to as “casuals” or the people that aren&#39;t as crazy as me about this sort of stuff. The people that just want to watch a movie with the click of a button rather than buying a physical disc or searching for an obscure torrent. </p> <p>I want to start my concerns about this phenomenon by stating that I am not a gloomy type of person. I see some of the benefits of AI technology when it come

It doesn’t really get all that interesting until the montage and the final fight. But man, something about that fight made it all worth it. I can’t describe it, just watching that iconic montage and fight made it feel like I didn’t waste my time. </p> <p>From there the movies just kept on getting better. My favorite one has to be 4. And to be honest I didn’t think 5 was that bad. It was enjoyable and had a good story, the only problem was since it was initially the last movie in the franchise, it would be a pretty bad way to end it. I’m glad they gave Rocky’s story a proper ending with Rocky Balboa (hate that name), which I also thought was a great movie. It had probably the most realistic fight in the whole franchise.</p> <p>I’ve also just finished all the Rambo movies, and just finished the first Creed movie. Al

I was rewatching 28 Weeks Later today and it is clear that Alice is not actually asymptomatic at all. Although she appears to largely retain her memories and her basic faculties, she displays all the signs of infection such as disfigurement (one of her eyes is heavily bloodshot), insanity she is found cowering alone in a room covered in crosses and symbols, aggression (both passive and overt), she appears to attempt to hurt her son and then when questioned by the US military she remains silent during questioning, possibly suggesting anger and an ulterior motive. The fact she allows her husband to kiss her could possibly be a sign of calculation, if she knows she is carrying the virus.</p> <p>One of the main things I noticed in the room Alice was found hiding in is th

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Brian De Palma has directed some of the most iconic films such as Carrie, Scarface, The Untouchables, and the first Mission Impossible. And yet he does not seem to be as talked about compared to the other New Hollywood filmmakers(Coppola and Scorsese for instance). He took advantage of the technical aspects of filmmaking such as using split screens and tracking shots in his films. However, from what I have read and seen, he seems to be a rather divisive figure in Hollywood. In addition to the surprising amount of Razzies he&#39;s been nominated for, many see him as style over substance and a major Hitchcock ripoff in many of his flicks. Others take issue to the gratuitous sex and violence as well. While I personally understand and enjoy some of his films, I am interested to learn what others opinions on him are?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/HotAssumption4750"> /u/HotAssumption4750 </a> <br/> <

## Educating Rita is the most beautiful film about self-determination and friendship

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So Educating Rita (1983) sees Blood Brothers author Willy Russel&#39;s updated take on the classic George Bernard Shaw play Pygmalion. He really subverts the narrative into something special and important. Michael Caine and Julie Walters are just phenomenal and arguably at their very best, as the middle class professor and his working class student, who also works as a hairdresser, in the 1980s. He is teaching her how to pass a literary course, with the narrative building up towards that final exam.</p> <p>The three key themes I identified were self-determination, friendship, and social class dynamics. </p> <p>Now, Pygmalion is the classic tale of a working-class woman being educated and transformed into a member of upper class society by a wise professor.</p> <p>The ending is quite dark, and it makes a point of how Eliza Doolittle feels she has lost her identity and it&#39;s exceedingly bleak. This was famously changed into a happy ending for the wo

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Okay, so the other night me and a buddy were trying to pick a movie, and I swear we spent like 45 minutes just scrolling through Netflix, Prime, Hulu, etc., arguing about what to watch. By the time we agreed on something, I was like, “Dude, we basically wasted an entire evening doing nothing.” It was ridiculous.</p> <p>In a fit of frustration, I threw together this weird little site: https://cinemaswipper[dot]com/. Think of it like swiping on Tinder, but instead of deciding if you like Becky or Brad, you’re deciding if you’d watch Jaws or some random French indie flick. You swipe left or right on whatever comes up, and hopefully land on something you both can actually get behind before your popcorn goes cold.</p> <p>I’m not selling anything, it’s just a random idea I had to fix a personal annoyance. Not saying it’s perfect—there’s probably some bizarre movies in there—but it might help break that cycle of “what do you wanna watch?” “I dunno, what do
