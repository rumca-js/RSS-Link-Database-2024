<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>My partner is getting back into gaming with me and he always mentions that he likes this one game where you die and are piecing clues from your own murder together throughout the game. I think it&#39;s somewhat of a puzzle platformer from what he has described and that I assume if you are able to figure out who did it, then maybe at the end of the game you&#39;re able to prevent the murder in the first place. I am not sure what console system it would have been on but he&#39;s 47 so it could have been anything from decades ago (and potentially remastered/remade?). If anyone knows a game like this, I would appreciate reviewing it and seeing if it would be the one. I think anything in this sort of genre would be good for him to try, since he likes story puzzles or anything where you have to go looking in every nook and cranny for special items.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/bcmain25"> /u/bcmain25

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I was reflecting on the game as I finally finished it a few years ago, and I wanted to show my appreciation for the game’s design aesthetics as it has a very surreal atmosphere near the end of the campaign mode.</p> <p>Like in the last few levels of the game, the game starts to get really strange with its level design as it’s hard to explain for those who didn’t play the game, but the endgame section is one of the most surreal stuff I have ever seen in a shoot em up game as strange things start happening as the game gets closer to its end.</p> <p>To put it simply, I miss having games like that as while it may look like a simple shooter, I feel like the studio (IREM) had put so much care into the game as it was quite an experience that I will never forget, and sometimes I wonder if there will ever another shoot em up with a surreal aesthetic to it as I waned to simply express myself.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https:

Also idea is to follow the classical GameBoy design but with few more buttons. </p> <p>Before I dive into the project, I’d love to hear your thoughts:</p> <p><strong>Would you be interested in a gamepad like this?</strong> </p> <p><strong>How much would you be willing to pay for it?</strong></p> <p><strong>Would you consider supporting this on Kickstarter if it gets there?</strong></p> <p><strong>Are there any features you’d want to see in a controller like this?</strong></p> <p>Any feedback or thoughts would be really helpful as I gather info before deciding how to proceed.
