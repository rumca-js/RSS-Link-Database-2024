The game featured international teams (48 teams that you can choose to play) and league, play-off and tournament modes. Although it used fictional player names (due to the lack of a license), the non-volatile memory of the Saturn allowed editing of names. The team kits were as close to the official 1996 kits as possible. The gameplay was also highly praised, and was the top-rated football game until International Superstar Soccer 64 was released one year later. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <",

This wasn&#39;t a good thing, and feel somehow these Dos games were better. Yeah Win 95 had ports of Doom, then Minesweeper, a cool Pinball game with Ski free but feel that somehow things just kinda got crappier for games. Then well...girls, no free time because of parties and girls, and now I&#39;m married with kids using Dosbox. </p> <p>So my question is, was I right? Did PC gaming kind of peak there? Or am I just thinking the golden age was when I had free time in High School as I had more free time, and less money to download l33t titles on a local BBS at 14.4k baud? Doom was absolutely huge with Barney mods, and .WAD files filled my paltry Hard Drive, while not knowing exactly what",
