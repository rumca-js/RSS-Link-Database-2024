(multiple and simultaneous instances).</p> <p>Does such a thing exist? So many of the Sonos alternatives are just fancy BT speakers, but the goal is to centralize the streaming server and just use phones as controllers only, not to sustain a connection for the entire listening duration.</p> <p>Just curious where current options sit in this space. </p>

Now maybe I got confused, buy I&#39;m pretty sure this even worked on my TV that didn&#39;t have Tailscale on it(In hindsight this doesn&#39;t sound possible, but I&#39;m pretty sure it worked to connect to my NAS just by providing the name).</p> <p>Now I recently messed up and reset my router so I got a new IP adress for my NAS and now something is broken.

So we have to buy it cash. In addition we have some expenses for buying the flat (lawyer, notary, civil engineer, etc.) and some costs to make it possible to rent the flat (renovation, electrician, kitchen, plumming, contractor, etc.).</p> <p>Now it&#39;s getting quite messy to track all of our expenses and to get an easy overview of what is done, how much we spent yet and also how much we spent per person.<br/> This mainly as the bills are coming in one by one.</p> <p>Is there any self hosted software to track a project like that?<br/> I would be happy to see who spent how much and on what date. I would analyze how much we spent for what (everything mentioned above like lawyer, electrician, etc.).<br/> If one of the usual financial apps can do that, it would be important

For media downloads tried to use the arr stack as the community loves it so much. </p> <p>But the issue is I live in a country where most of the torrent index websites are blocked. So only way for me is to use a VPN to add the index to prowlarr and pull the torrents. First, Used gluetun as http proxy for my prowlarr (protonvpn free tier). But most of cloudflare challenges failed in flaresolverr so dropped that. </p> <p>Next, leaving out arr stack, thought of browsing the torrents from aggregator sites like cleanbay or torrents-csv (seems also self hostable).. and send the torrent/magnet to qbittorrent. This works but not sure if I would lose out on anything if I do this way. Though I have to do this manually atleast it works?</p> <p>So my question is, Is there a better solution for this?

I&#39;ve decided to bite the bullet and take up self hosting a media server, the rage I feel when using my girlfriend&#39;s streaming apps is palpable, and she&#39;s getting less happy with em too.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone! I have a Jellyfin server set up on my local network that I can access via wireguard remotely. However, I want to share it with non-technical family members.</p> <p>I figured using <strong>Tailscale</strong> would be the easiest way to go about this (EDIT: they will create their own tailscale accounts and I will share the machine with them). I bought a domain on <strong>Cloudflare</strong>, and my plan was to set up a SRV record to point the domain to tailscale IP of the machine along with the Jellyfin port (so I don&#39;t have to bother with a reverse proxy). So I currently have an A record pointing to the IP, and then a SRV record pointing to the domain of the A record.</p> <p><strong>My question is - how do I get SSL for HTTPS?</strong> In tailscale&#39;s console there is an option for HTTPS, but it&#39;s only for tailscale&#39;s mDNS it seems. Is the best way to go about this to just create a CNAME record on my domain and point to th
