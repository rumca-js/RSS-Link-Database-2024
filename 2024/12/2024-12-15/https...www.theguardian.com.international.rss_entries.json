        "description": "<p>Keeping up the pretence that this is no title challenge is becoming harder for Chelsea to maintain. Boosted by Arsenal and Liverpool squandering points on Saturday, Enzo Maresca\u2019s team broke Brentford\u2019s hold over them and delivered in the manner of potential champions by winning a tight game thanks to goals from Marc Cucurella, who was sent off after full time, and Nicolas Jackson.</p><p>No doubt Maresca will stay measured, even after seeing Chelsea end a run of three consecutive home defeats to their neighbours. He will note that Robert S\u00e1nchez, so often maligned, had to make a huge save from Christian N\u00f8rgaard at 1-0. F\u00e1bio Carvalho, the Brentford substitute, then hit the bar during a nervy finale. Bryan Mbeumo halved the deficit in the 90th minute.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/dec/15/chelsea-brentford-premier-league-match-report\">Continue reading...</a>",

Such was the dominance of Ange Postecoglou\u2019s version of the glory game over Southampton\u2019s it ended up being a question of exactly when Russell Martin\u2019s misguided evangelism will be discontinued. And not if. Saints\u2019 main contribution to any free-flowing, inventive football was letting Spurs play exactly as they liked.</p><p>In pre-match, there had been insurrection in the ranks of the away support, calling for the departure of Daniel Levy after the chairman was spotted in the stands. If there are doubts in Postecoglou, the fault lines between fan and boardroom run far deeper. Two seasons ago, on Tottenham\u2019s previous Premier League visit to St Mary\u2019s, a rancorous 3-3 draw had preceded Antonio Conte kissing off with a post-match rant for the ages, leaving Levy and the club\u2019s executive class\u2019s ears burning as he took his leave.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/dec/15/",
