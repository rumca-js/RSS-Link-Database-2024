<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Good dayüôã Is there someone who works on a project where there&#39;s big data involved, i mean big database ( we use postgresql) where in one table for example, there is a lot of entries and there is a need of generating a report of them. For us we have celery and redis doing the work. The best part, It is not blocking the application but we are not very satisfied with the generation part. For example in order to generate a report of 10000 identifications, it takes around 20min. I would like to hear other stories and experience of dealing with generation of big report with a lot of data.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/afrokemet95"> /u/afrokemet95 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/1hey4ft/report_of_big_data_experience_stories/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/1hey4ft/report_of_big_data_experience_stories/">[comments]<

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been working on an HMIS with modules implemented as apps. We have the Nursing Station, Pharmacy, Inventory, Laboratory etc. Is it possible to license these modules independently with something like an annual subscription? I&#39;ve mostly worked with Django for web, nothing too fancy that might require licensing or subscriptions so I&#39;m not even sure if this is possible. I currently run the project using Docker and Docker Compose.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SocialKritik"> /u/SocialKritik </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/1heuapk/licensing_django_apps/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/1heuapk/licensing_django_apps/">[comments]</a></span>

I&#39;m trying to implement a few more solid design patterns in the app. So this is kind of practice, but also being used in prod.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Greetings.</p> <p>Over the past year, I‚Äôve been developing a loan origination system. The first app I built was a Financial Spreading tool. As I continued building other apps and learning web development (my professional background is in commercial credit), I realized the Financial Spreading app needed to be more customizable.</p> <p>To address this, I started by creating a GL Code Manager, which allows users to expand upon a default Chart of Accounts. In a separate view, those accounts are displayed in a table, where users can select which ones to include in a Financial Form Template. Additionally, I began working on an &#39;Expression Manager&#39; to enable custom calculations. The goal is for users to use these templates to ‚Äúspread‚Äù financial statements‚Äîa common term in credit analysis and underwriting.</p> <p>By September, I had reached a good point in development, but starting a new full-time job has limited the time I can dedicate to the projec
