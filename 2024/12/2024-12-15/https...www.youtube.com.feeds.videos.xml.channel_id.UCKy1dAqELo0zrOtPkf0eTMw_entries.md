Dragon Ball Sparking! Zero is the most successful Dragon Ball game to date, which is saying something when you consider how many games have been made about Goku, Vegeta, and company. Let’s take a crash course of the history of how Akira Toriyama’s beloved manga-turned-anime has inspired some incredibly innovative games, as well as quite a few terrible ones, from the Famicom tie-ins released shortly after the original Dragon Ball began airing in Japan, up through the golden age of sixteen-bit fighting games, and the renaissance of DBZ following its meteoric rise in popularity in the United States.
