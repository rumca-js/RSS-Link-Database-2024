<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have tried A bunch of different RSS apps. And I have tried setting them up how I like them and I gave up a bunch of times because it wasn&#39;t really making a whole lot of sense to me. My reason for looking for a better option is that Google to keep up with the things I care about.</p> <p>Essentially, I just want to have a news feed where I can curate sources, or topics, and have it only show that stuff. I understand that this is pretty much the definition of what an RSS feed is supposed to do. </p> <p>My issue however, is that anytime I have set up feeds, it doesn&#39;t seem to show all that much information. I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m supposed to be linking direct to websites? Are there user generated RSS feeds that are popular that I can add? Where do I find these feeds? Is this still a well supported technology where it&#39;s worth trying again or am I wasting my time and should just download X or something like that instead?</p> </div><!-- S
