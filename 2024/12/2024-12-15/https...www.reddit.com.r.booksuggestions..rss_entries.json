I even listened to the audiobooks, to get another experience with these books. Yes, it was that amazing. Thanks to this trilogy, I also kinda discovered my own taste in books/films. I watched all the historic movies directed by Ridley Scott and I totally fell in love with them. And right now, I need more :D</p> <p>Do you have any recommendations on very good medieval books with great adventure: travelling through the kingdoms with bunch of chums, meeting new friends, love or enemies. With also some politics and philosofic questions or debates together with friends. But also with entartaining fights and battles. Plus I don&#39;t really mind about historical accuracy. There also was a bit of magic in Sapkowski&#39;s hussite trilogy and it was fine. I really just want",

They&#39;re not actually about ghosts, or anything supernatural but reflect upon something prevalent in the society, humanity, mental illness etc.. it could have an open-ended ending or some body horror, romance, suicide sci fi etc. With the sadness and melancholy aspect, I&#39;d want something like the Ghibli move &quot;Grave of the Fireflies&quot; or something more relatable like &quot;100 centimetres per second&quot;. Maybe it could be like Junji Ito&#39;s works?

He said Maze Runner was among the best books he has ever read, so I wanted to gift him something that would be similar to the series.</p> <p>What I mean by that is the overall setting and tone of the story.

I\u2019m a young Italian guy aiming to become a comic book artist, and this year Feltrinelli (a well-known bookstore chain in Italy) is hosting a contest where participants have to create a comic based on a book. The problem is that I\u2019ve only recently started reading, so far I\u2019ve only read The Murder at the Vicarage by Agatha Christie and I\u2019m currently reading Animal Farm by George Orwell.</p> <p>I wanted to ask you which book you think I could choose to adapt for this contest that would work really well. Since I still don\u2019t know my tastes very well when it comes to books, I\u2019ll share my favorite movies and video games so you can get a general idea of what I like:</p> <p>My all-time favorite movies are Fight Club, Donnie Darko, and The Wind Rises. The third one is very different from the first two, but overall I really like psychological thriller movies as well as Studio Ghib",

I don&#39;t like mafia books or sports romances, so not that lol. Spice is also preferred. I love the sombre, gloomy vibes of The Tearsmith. I can give more details if there are questions on what I&#39;m looking for lol.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/trollbellygem\"> /u/trollbellygem </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1heib8v/looking_for_a_book_like_the_tearsmith/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1heib8v/looking_for_a_book_like_the_tearsmith/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I read an old Neil Stephenson novel called, <em>The Big U</em>, which was cool at first but about halfway through turned into an almost unreadable mix of sci-fi, fantasy, and college satire.
