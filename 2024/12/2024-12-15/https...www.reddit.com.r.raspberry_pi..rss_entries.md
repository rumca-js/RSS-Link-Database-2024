<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello! I recently bought a CM4, CM5 and CM5 IO Board. I was told the CM5 IO board should work (mostly) with the CM4. I can confirm the CM5 boots just fine from eMMC and it works great. </p> <p>The CM4 on the other hand just refuses to boot from the a mirco sd card flashed with pi os. The specific error is &quot;cmd 81a0010 status 0&quot;. </p> <p>I have already updated the bootloader to the latest one using rpiboot and tried disabling eMMC boot using the jumper cable with no avail. USB boot is not working as well so I&#39;m at a loss now. I&#39;ve tried 3 different sd cards as well as literally every compatible pi os version. </p> <p>What&#39;s going on, is it not really compatible with the CM4?</p> <p>Would really appreciate help! I tried posting in sticky thread but no help and was getting a hit depserate :(</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/AmountOk3836"> /u/AmountOk3836 </a> <br/> <span><a href
