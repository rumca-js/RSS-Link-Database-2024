Running a large model like LLaMa 3.1 takes so long that I can get other tasks done while waiting for it to initialize.

## AI that lets you import your own samples and have it build music around it?

## AGI and sentience deep thought

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I know the topic of sentience is a common rabbit-hole discussion, but I strongly believe that AI will soon be able to <em>convince</em> people that it&#39;s sentient, thereby achieving a sort of faux sentience that&#39;s indistinguishable from the real thing.</p> <p>Since we don&#39;t really know what sentience/consciousness even is, there&#39;s no clearcut way to measure it, test it, or demonstrate it. For example, if I asked you to prove you&#39;re sentient, how would you do it?? You can&#39;t.</p> <p>So, all this talk about AI achieving sentience seems to be misguided, because it doesn&#39;t matter if the AI is truly sentient or not. All that matters is if it can convince you that it is. 🤯</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Siciliano777"> /u/Siciliano777 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1hektnu/agi_and_sentience_deep_thought/">[link]</a></span> &#3

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I graduated undergrad with a Finance degree. I do marketing currently as my own business but am bored out of my mind and hate it. I&#39;m considering law school because I&#39;ve always loved law and want a change. Between my GPA, probable LSAT score, and resources to do well, I&#39;d imagine I&#39;d end up at a top law school.</p> <p>Law is a slow evolving industry. They still do things some industries gave up 50 years ago. Do I think AI is an IMMEDIATE threat to law? No. But do I see it eventually taking over contracts and research and making firms hire 80% less lawyers? 100%.</p> <p>I&#39;m really trying to figure out if I spend all that money and time to do this if in say, 20 years, it&#39;s turned on it&#39;s head and rendered useless. </p> <p>How do you think AI will effect Law?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Santal33nStocks"> /u/Santal33nStocks </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.
