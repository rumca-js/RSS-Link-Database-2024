## Shawn Speakman, while at Dragonsteel Nexus, allegedly said that George is at the max amount of pages the publisher can bind for TWOW. Random House wants to do a split and publish what is available while George wants to avoid a AFFC/ADWD split.

Sometimes it feels like the book is almost too on the nose about colonialism. until i remind myself that what we&#39;re reading is <em>still</em> less brutal than what happened in real life.

I&#39;m missing a couple of books, but they&#39;ve all so far been defined by the importance of the three religions to the setting, story, and characters. And yet, while we have definite proof as to the existence of magic, and the numinous, and some kind of life after death that can sometimes be interfered in multiple ways, resulting in various forms of hauntings, there is no equivalent evidence of the veracity of either one of the faiths. The fantastical nature of the world makes it is possible for there to be a god, or more, but the only certain supernatural elements are all of a pagan nature. </p> <p>There is no way to get a definite answer from the text, but I was wondering how people interpret the world of Sarantium. Are the three faiths essentially hookum, or do they fit into the natural magic of the world? Is Jad behind magic, and ghosts part of his afterlife, or does he

It&#39;s cool, I liked it. In the same vein, you can play Invoker in Dota 2 and have kind of the same mechanic, though you will probably be distracted from the wizard fantasy by the general experience of playing dota.</p> <p>There is Nox - an old diablo-like where, if you play a wizard, you hear your character pronounce the incantation and see the gestures he makes flash in little circles. This is cool. I&#39;m not a huge fan of diablo-likes, so I didn&#39;t actually beat it, but now that writing this post made me remember about that game, so I went and installed it again, maybe I&#39;ll finis

Finally get them to listen to some of my favourites that they kept saying they wanted to read but never got around to. And it&#39;s worked!

I was so fed up with the main character’s idiocy that I couldn’t take it anymore. But what really made me quit was the railroading by the author. It was one of the most severe cases I’ve ever seen and was the main culprit of the main character’s poor decision making.</p> <p>So why would I restart the series you ask? Well I’ve never had quite as much fun learning Magic as I did reading this series. The Mentor and mentee relationship in the first half of the first book was everything I could ask for. Even if the mentor did overdo the grinch role a bit. The magic system and magic lore throughout the world was also very interesting. It had a bunch of cliches but it did them well in these cases.</p> <p>But when he leaves home the book and series seems to lose itself.

This is the third of her books that I&#39;ve read, and possibly my favorite after her utterly fantastical <em>A Face Like Glass</em>. </p> <p>The book takes place in the country/continent of Raddith, an enigmatic and isolated part of the world reknowned for its deeply haunted coastal marsh woods, and it&#39;s (not unrelated) cursing problem. Raddith is a place that reveres the contract and respect for the contract. As the book makes clear, when there&#39;s fae wonders in the woods all around you, you respect hewing to honest agreements more than looking for myth and wonder. </p>

My feelings on this book are pretty conflicted. On the one hand, this is some of the most ambitious and exciting storytelling I&#39;ve ever seen in the epic fantasy genre. On the other hand, there are some <em>abysmal</em> flaws that drag the experience down quite a bit.</p> <p>Before I get into the review, I do want to say something: I am a Brandon Sanderson fan—I believe some of the books he&#39;s written stand alongside the best of the genre, like Hobb&#39;s Tawny Man trilogy, Abercrombie&#39;s <em>The Heroes</em>, Fonda Lee&#39;s <em>Green Bone Saga</em>, and more. But I&#39;m also very critical of his work, because when I read works of his that have major weaknesses, I know that he can do a lot better from other things I&#39;ve read from him.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>After finishing a few darker books, I&#39;m looking for something lighter but not a full comedy. Even a witty book that&#39;s darker (Blacktongue Thief) could do. </p> <p>A similar &#39;vibe&#39; I think are things like Cradle by Will Wight, Star Wars, The Eye of the World by Robert Jordan, Lord of the Rings, Codex Alera and Riyria by Michael J Sullivan.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/BadNewsBears62"> /u/BadNewsBears62 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1hehbvu/novels_with_heart/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1hehbvu/novels_with_heart/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I am looking for a book series I can’t remember if they were mage or wizard , but basically the main character finds a relic from the past that teaches him magic , and he can put magic in sand or something like that to make bombs and he eventually learns to make flying things to fly on and drop those bombs from. I think the main character was a poor guy who would go into relic graves or thombs and find things to sell for money to survive</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Gameznoob1"> /u/Gameznoob1 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1heh1hg/cant_remember_title/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1heh1hg/cant_remember_title/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am currently on book 4 of I think 11 (That&#39;s how many I purchased on Kindle) and I love this series. I don&#39;t have any friends who read so my excitement gets deflated when I try to talk to people about books and they don&#39;t really care. If you have please no spoilers.... I just want to talk to someone about a series I am in love with.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/BelleoftheBall0131"> /u/BelleoftheBall0131 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1heggi2/has_anyone_read_the_royals_of_villian_academy/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1heggi2/has_anyone_read_the_royals_of_villian_academy/">[comments]</a></span>
