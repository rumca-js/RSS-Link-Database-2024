<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>It’s definitely dated in a few spots but gosh I don’t think any other future film has felt so disturbing to me. Particularly because the human population is still very much alive but now extremely overpopulated. Planet of the Apes, I Am Legend, or most post apocalypse films have very few humans left. Granted I know the population will never get this bad but it felt more real to me. </p> <p>And the final twist which I’m sure everyone knows by now, most humans are processed to be converted into food for the rest also feels real. I’ve recently learned much of the food we eat is grown in sewage! A shocking truth but hey what else can we do? We need food! And the rich practically get away with everything! Again who do we know recently this has happened with? </p> <p>Gosh the film has really left me shaken still all these years.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/seveer37"> /u/seveer37 </a> <br/> <span><a

A film not only about illusions themselves but also the balance of art and relationships, and the obfuscation of the true ugly nature of how these illusions operate and the massive physical and mental toll they take on the performer, such as Angier’s constant suicidal water tank trick, recreating for himself over and over again the same experience that led to the death of his wife.</p> <p>At the end of The Dark Knight , Gordon and Batman decide to lie to the public ab

It plays often like a rehash of the original (even making fun of it, like when Willis asks how it can happen to him twice). The villains are fine, but not anywhere near as memorable as Alan Rickman or Irons. And so on.</p> <p>But I still really like it as a fun action flick and a worthy successor even if it doesn&#39;t quite compare to its predecessor and successor. The setting is great as an airport at Christmas is a fabulous setting for maximum carnage and chaos.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I recently watched the new Taron Egerton film Carry-on and the whole main guy with an Earpiece being blackmailed by a mysterious bad guy reminded me allot of the 2002 film phone booth. I then thought and reminded that its scarily similar to the first half of 24 season 1. Is there any more films or tv shows that follow that same kind of concept?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/OkBuy1504"> /u/OkBuy1504 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hequ81/carryon_style_films_and_tv_shows/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hequ81/carryon_style_films_and_tv_shows/">[comments]</a></span>

The guy travels for a long time through our solar system until the last planet. He finds his dad’s wrecked ship and turns out his dad is alive and living in the ship. I hope this made sense.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>First and foremost I know this is a much discussed movie. When I first saw the promo pic for it, it looked like any other rom com. Plus Rachel macadams had done The Vow and Time travelers wife before it. So I initially judged it harshly.</p> <p>I fell in love with this movie around 2018 when I finally got around to it and it’s become one of my top movies to watch.</p> <p>I’ve realized why I love it so much and find it so comforting. The father and son relationship reminds me so much of my husband and his dad. They have a wonderful relationship of friendship, respect, playfulness and love. Whenever my husband is out of town and I’m missing him, I watch this movie and I’ve only just realized it’s because it reminds me of him in a way. </p> <p>We have 2 daughters and while he won’t have the son and father relationship, I know he will have the same silly and playful relationship with them rooted in love.</p> <p>Sorry that was a lot! lol </p> <p>What movi

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey all, I love going to watch movies in the theatre as I truly believe it can make a huge difference for many films compared with watching at home. Unfortunately I don&#39;t always have friends or family that want to join but I&#39;ve always felt too socially uncomfortable to go by myself as I feel people will judge me.</p> <p>I just recently decided I should give it a try and man am I happy I did. Some movies are great to watch with friends, but sometimes it&#39;s awesome to be able to fully focus and engage with a film without being distracted by others, especially at the theatre. Most recently I went to catch the re-release of Interstellar in 70mm on my own and it was genuinely one of the best movie theatre experiences I&#39;ve ever had. </p> <p>Long story short, if you&#39;ve ever held back on going to a see a film alone, do yourself a favor and go to the movies on your own you won&#39;t regret it. Nobody is judging you!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Does anyone else have a soft spot for this movie? Something about it just does it for me. Pre weird-era Johnny Depp as a rare books dealer; part Indiana Jones adventure, part National Treasure, but with satanic manuscripts instead of doodads and geegaws. Not really horror, but still spooky and unsettling at times. Impeccable vibes, not really sure how to describe other than mellow and dusty? Still plenty entertaining and engaging though- this is one of my go-to rewatches and always hits the spot.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Dingus_Squatford"> /u/Dingus_Squatford </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hegku9/ninth_gate_johnny_depp_dir_roman_polanski_1999/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hegku9/ninth_gate_johnny_depp_dir_roman_polanski_1999/">[comments]</a></span>
