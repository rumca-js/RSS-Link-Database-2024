## Ask HN: How do you find part time work?

<p>I have a project that I'm working on turning into a small business. I've done some part-time work (retainers and project-based) over the past year and it's gone well. It's relatively high pay for part-time work, leaving me time and flexibility to work on my own project.<p>The thing, I haven't really put much work into finding this kind of work. I've had a few opportunities land in my lap pretty nicely. Now, I need to seek out more work like this. I have ideas, but I'm curious to see how others are finding part-time work. Ideally, I would get 10-15/hr a week retainers, but project-based work is ok too. The key is that I can keep getting the work with consistency.<p>My corporate career was a cross between engineering and product management. I truly believe my best utility is the cross-over of the two. I'd be happy to do part-time leadership for small teams, take on independent projects, do things like build and maintain small apps/integrations, etc.<p>So:<p>1) How are you finding pa

<p>Hello, everyone. I built Unicorn: an embeddable MISRA C:2012 implementation of essential Unicode Algorithms.<p>Unicorn is designed to be fully customizable: you can select which Unicode algorithms and character properties are included or excluded from compilation. You can also exclude Unicode character blocks wholesale for scripts your application does not support. It's perfect for resource constrained devices like microcontrollers and IoT devices.<p>About me: I quit my Big Corp job a few years back to pursue my passion for software development and this is one of my first commercial releases.</p>

## Lost IBM OS/2 Warp 3 and 4 localizations: Looking for help finding and archiving

<p>It's amazing how software from a major company that is less than 30 years old can get lost & forgotten so fast.<p>Building on a 2022 post about finding a copy of the long lost Slovenian OS/2 Warp 4 - https://www.os2museum.com/wp/slovenian-os-2-warp-4/ - some fellow software archaeologists have concluded some other localization editions are still missing - copied from the post's comments:<p>--
OBattler says:

It turns out Slovenian isn’t the only version missing of OS/2 Warp 4.0 – Portuguese (Portugal) and Portuguese (Brazil) are also missing, as are Dutch, French, Finnish, Norwegian, and Swedish, and a non-trial version of Hungarian.<p>OBattler says:
December 8, 2024 at 10:01 am
I just found FixPack 5 for OS/2 Warp 3.0 (or at least, references thereof) Arabic, French (Canada), Hebrew, Thai, Turkish, and, apparently, also Bulgarian and Lithuaian! So OS/2 Warp 4.0 must have also existed in these languages.<p>Source: https://ecsoft2.org/system-fixpacks-and-

## I Track My Health Data in Markdown: Lessons in Digital Longevity

<p>I’ve spent years tracking my sleep, diet, and exercise with apps and wearables. But here’s the problem: when an app gets discontinued or stops syncing, the data—and all the insights—disappear.<p>That’s why I’ve adopted a “file over app” philosophy for health tracking. Instead of relying on apps, I save everything in open, accessible formats like Markdown or CSV. These files are local, portable, and universally readable—ensuring my data outlives any app or platform.<p>Here’s how I do it:
 • Workouts, meals, and sleep logs go into plain text notes.
 • Trends and averages (e.g., weekly sleep hours) are calculated in Google Sheets.
 • Files sync to the cloud (Google Drive) and back up locally.<p>For example, my sleep log might look like this:<p>### Sleep Log (December 2024)  
- 12/01: 7.5 hrs (11:00 PM - 6:30 AM)  
- 12/02: 6 hrs (12:30 AM - 6:30 AM) - Felt tired, adjusted bedtime.  
- 12/03: 8 hrs (10:30 PM - 6:30 AM)<p>Why this matters:
 • Plain text lasts. It’s universally accessib
