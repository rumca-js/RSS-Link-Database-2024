I was previously using 7800xt, so I swapped it with new card and installed the distro provided drivers. I tried running some games, specifically tried running Alan Wake 2. I am on 1440p so I am expecting the card to max out all settings and I do that, but immediately the game drops to 16 fps. So I thought it could just be Ray tracing on linux so I turned it off, the performance was better, but still less than 60 fps on average. My 7800xt was performing better than this. So I switched on the logs (jornalctl -f) and I noticed while the game was launching, somewhere it was mentioned like reporting as AMD gpu. I tried launching another game and noticed the same message. I then ran Superposition benchmark and the results were somewhere between 3080 ti and 3090 and then I notice the GPU, it says amdgpu. Why is this? Could this be the cause for terrible performance?
