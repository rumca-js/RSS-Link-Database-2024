So, I&#39;m ready to give it a chance, but wanted to listen impressions from theouse who plays / played the game in regards of two things:</p> <p>1) How do you find pre-build decks? I don&#39;t have plans to collect cards, build my own decks, etc. I&#39;d enjoy default decks / scenarios and question is if it is enjoyable.</p> <p>and</p> <p>2) If it indeed allows to create a story? Like RPG like expierence? Considering that I have a group that has creativity willing to implement it during the game.</p> <p>What do you think?

So I recently got my hands on campaign for North Africa and my gaming group and I have been playing short 25 hour long games of it for about a month.

I\u2019ve skim read all the rules and to me it seems like I can just cut out loads of stuff and barely anything will change, but I want the opinion of others first, and also I feel like it goes against the spirit of the board game. The only reason it\u2019s in anyway famous is because of its extreme length and complexity, and turning it into a more complex HOI4 seems like an insult to the creator.

I know that Is Better with 3 player or more, but I know It exists an automa expansion. Does It improve the game for 2 player, giving the best experience of the game? (I usually Always play with my wife, because it&#39;s Always difficult to organize with Friends). -I know that exists Gaia Project and Age of Innovation, but I also know that these games are a lot more complex (if I understood correctly), and I don&#39;t want this. -I tried Terra Mystica online and really liked It (but obviously having It physically could change the experience). -I also know It exists Ark Nova, which Is considered Better, but I want a single map shared between players. It give Is a Better competition feeling. -Or does exists other games with similar experience?</p> <p>Thank you!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Doudo19\"> /u/Doudo19 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"http",
