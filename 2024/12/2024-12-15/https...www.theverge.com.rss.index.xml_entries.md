  <p id="HXzLQO">Apple hopes to release a foldable 18.8-inch creaseless iPad by about 2028, <em>Bloomberg</em>’s Mark Gurman writes in <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-12-15/apple-working-on-giant-foldable-ipad-revamped-mouse-longer-range-airtag-2">today’s <em>Power On </em>newsletter</a>.
