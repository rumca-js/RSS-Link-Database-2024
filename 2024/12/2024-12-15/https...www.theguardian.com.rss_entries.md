The defending Super Bowl champions have 10 wins by seven points or less, with six coming on the game’s final play.

Five years ago Exeter were beating Toulouse en route to winning the Champions Cup and putting the seal on one of English team sport’s great Cinderella tales. These days the gap between the teams is such a yawning chasm that the French visitors had a bonus point wrapped up after just 35 minutes.</p><p>To be fair to Exeter, the defending champions are in a sufficiently rich vein of form in this competition that it almost doesn’t matter whom they are playing against.

<p><strong>London Coliseum</strong> <br>Artistic director Aaron S Watkin oversees a faintly surreal Edwardian setting of dancing chimney sweeps, suffragettes and Liquorice Allsorts in a sweet but not sickly production</p><p>English National Ballet’s brand new production of the Nutcracker vastly improves on its previous version. It doesn’t come with a gimmick or drastic reinterpretation, only the sense that artistic director Aaron S Watkin has really thought things through – and hired a cracking designer, Dick Bird, to make the stage zing.<br><br>
 The setting is Edwardian London, a view of St Paul’s, chimney sweeps and suffragettes (very Mary Poppins), where magician Drosselmeyer owns a sweet emporium (very Willy Wonka) and is the person pulling all the strings. Getting ahead of Nutcracker’s famously unsatisfying narrative, Watkin and co-choreographer Arielle Smith lay breadcrumbs in the prologue for the later scenes, and make a good stab at weaving some coherence through the acts, w

Yet the Brighton manager will be disappointed by the way his side allowed their emotions to get the better of them as Ismaïla Sarr scored twice to seal a memorable victory for Palace over their arch-enemies that ended their unbeaten record at home this season.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/dec/15/brighton-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report">Continue read

<p>Silver medallist at the European Rowing Championships in 1962 who became an inspiring coach and influential administrator</p><p>When Penny Chuter, who has died aged 82, began to mess about in a rowing dinghy as a toddler and with water sports as a teenager, rowing clubs were for men only. The European Championships and the Olympics were open only to men, and the council of Britain’s Amateur Rowing Association (ARA) hardly ever saw a woman at its table.</p><p>Now clubs welcome female members. The world championships and the Olympics offer equal numbers of open events for women and men (as does the Henley Royal Regatta), and the headcount of women who row has grown enormously in schools, universities, clubs, competitions and worldwide.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/dec/15/penny-chuter-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

Externally untouched since it was finished in 1966, this celebrated Brutalist masterpiece came with a few caveats – namely its single-glazed windows set in iron frames, that don’t open, making it more than a little chilly in winter and a greenhouse when temperatures soar. “You have to really love this building to live in this apartment,” laughs Giorgetti, joking that he needs to wear a hat and scarf in bed during winter and still wakes up with a frozen face.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/dec/15/finding-beauty-in-brut

Sadly, this eventually stopped him from going on holiday. Then I, too, started to suffer similar apprehension, so I consulted a psychotherapist. She recommended a small piece of cognitive behavioural therapy, which involved acknowledging the mental and physical symptoms of anxiety, but telling myself that these were essentially indistinguishable from feelings of excitement about the prospect of a journey. This reframing of my feelings has been reasonably effective – it’s one way of dealing with uncertainty.</p><p>It’s not just the uncertainty of travel that we all have to face. No

<p>6,400m up a rarely climbed peak in the Himalayas, two climbers lost most of their kit – and nearly their lives. One of them, Fay Manners, explains what keeps her climbing</p><p>Fay Manners was 6,400m up a mountain in the Indian Himalayas when she heard her climbing partner, Michelle Dvorak, scream from below. The rope attaching her to the rock face snapped tight, but held firm. Fearing something terrible had happened, Manners looked down with dread – but thankfully Dvorak was still dangling beneath her on the end of the rope.</p><p>Her relief quickly turned to horror when she realised the bag containing most of their gear, which they had been hauling on the rope behind them, had been cut loose by a falling rock and was gone. Along with it went much of their&nbsp;safety gear, their tent, food, stove and water.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/15/if-we-dont-get-off-this-mountain-i-dont-think-i-can-do-another-night-climber-fay-manners-on-surviving-the-odds">Con

<p>Humour and pathos go hand in hand in Rungano Nyoni’s award-winning second feature</p><p>With this follow-up to her Bafta-winning 2017 debut <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/22/i-am-not-a-witch-review-magical-surrealism-margaret-mulubwa-rungano-nyoni">I Am Not a Witch</a></em>, the Zambian-Welsh director Rungano Nyoni cements her position as one of the most distinctive and exciting film-makers at work in the UK. The black comedy <em>On Becoming a Guinea Fowl</em>, which last weekend picked up British independent film awards for best director and breakthrough performance (for Susan Chardy), is a fascinating, fresh take on a familiar theme.</p><p>There are parallels here with everything from Thomas Vinterberg’s <em>Festen</em> to Mira Nair’s <em>Monsoon Wedding</em> in the premise: an extended family gathering – in this case a funeral and period of ritual mourning – acts as a catalyst that uncovers long-buried family shame and secrets.

As well as batch-making mince pies, biscuit logs and vol-au-vents, I love a festive-themed ice-cream or, in this instance, semifreddo. This cassata-inspired one is my new festive favourite – it’s embarrassingly easy (pretend it’s harder, if you like) and triumphs on so many Christmas flavours.

<p>Last season’s finalists Littler and Humphries start favourites but the field of potential winners is wider than ever</p><p>The double two. At the end of the seventh set. Luke Littler’s on 58, two darts left, but he thinks he’s on 68. He hits the treble-18. Realises what he’s done. Steps away. Steps up. Misses the double two that would have put him 5-2 up in the world championship final. Loses the next five sets in a row. In his idler moments Littler sometimes watches this match back, and this is the point at which he has to turn off.<br><br>
 There’s a good case for anointing that double two as the most famous missed dart in the history of the sport. It’s either that or Michael van Gerwen’s double-12 after 17 perfect darts in the 2014 semi-final. The point is that nowhere else does so much taper down to so little, so quickly.

<p>Don’t write them off as just another step in your routine: primers can make a huge difference to whatever goes on top</p><p>I never really thought that primers would form a significant part of my makeup ritual. For me, primers were simply another step I just didn’t have time for. And so I skipped it. To my peril. What I have long realised is that a decent primer is imperative to the (quality) finish of your makeup. It creates an even, blurring and hydrating base for everything that follows. This means, fundamentally, you avoid everything on your face sliding around before you’ve made it down the street. Putting on makeup without a primer is a bit like painting over layers of wallpaper. You think it looks OK. Then you compare it to a wall that has been skimmed, cleaned and primed before being painted. And you get an aha moment. There’s no comparing the two. However, I do understand why, aside from the time factor, tons of people don’t use primers. Historically, the textures and for

<p>The challenges facing Ahmed al-Sharaa’s new government are numerous, complex and daunting. But the west must not attempt to dictate events </p><p>One struggle ends, another begins. Revolution begets counter-revolution. Hopes soar, disappointment and disillusion follow. Is this what the future holds for Syria? In the immediate aftermath of last weekend’s sudden <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/14/the-army-just-ran-away-how-bashar-al-assad-lost-his-brutal-grip-on-syria">toppling of Bashar al-Assad’s despicable regime</a>, euphoria reigns. After 13 years of civil war, and more than 50 years of oppressive dictatorship, the scent of freedom is intoxicating. The people of Syria celebrated their liberation on the streets in vast numbers. Statues of Assad and his father, Hafez, lifeless monuments to fear, were pulled down and smashed. Who would deny them these moments of vital joy? Theirs is a victory for all who love freedom.</p><p>Elation conceals deep anxiety. The ch

<p>It’s about facing the freedom you have now, not as an overwhelming burden but as an opportunity</p><p><em><strong>The question </strong>I am nearing 80 and am overwhelmed by what I think is called existential boredom. The truth is I’ve been struggling with it for what seems like aeons</em><em>… I have achieved all my ambitions – and loads more – but I’m now at a loss as to what do next. I am constantly told to get a hobby or join a choir, by people who have no idea of what deep boredom is</em><em>. I envy them! What do you suggest I do?</em></p><p><em><strong>Philippa’s answer </strong></em>That existential boredom you describe, it’s not just any boredom, is it? It’s not the kind that can be swept away with a new hobby or a trivial distraction. No wonder you feel frustrated when people tell you to “keep busy”, as though filling time could address what’s really going on inside you.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/dec/15/im-nearly-80-and-theres-a-void-in-m
