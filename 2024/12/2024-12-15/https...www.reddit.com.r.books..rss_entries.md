<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Wow. Just...wow. I am speechless. It&#39;s been one month since I finished this book and I have yet to decide how I should write this review for I am afraid I will not do justice to it. Isn&#39;t it funny? How unpredictable books can be? You enter to a book with little to no expectations and somehow, it ends up becoming one of your most favourite books. There&#39;s something magical with this. <em>Just like there was something magical with this book.</em></p> <p>I can&#39;t say that I am a huge fan of the original novel of Peter Pan. Sure, it is very whimsical, adventurous and fun and it also has some dark elements that add more to the story. But I never felt any particular connection with it. That being said, last year I developed a keen interest on Peter Pan&#39;s retellings. I was always a firm believer of how easy it is to twist the tale of Peter Pan and Neverland and how much scope of imagination one can find in this story. Last year, I had the

And ofc a whole found family that is just like her with traumatic passes and magic and are so badass and hot and cool in a laid back way and would do anything for each other. I mean I just eat it up every time! </p> <p>Itâ€™s the adult version of the type of books I devoured as a child. Itâ€™s magic but also thereâ€™s sex and trauma and the stakes are way higher lol.</p> <p>Oh and how can I forget I also love Gods an

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I read a lot of fantasy. I was just thinking about how I got into fantasy. Some 30 years ago in my early high school years I was reading Stephen King. I read Tommyknockers and Needful Things, then I stumbled across The Eyes of the Dragon and LOVED it. While reading it, my uncle bought me the first book in the Dragon King trilogy by Stephen R. Law Lawhead which I devoured and then followed it with his Pendragon Cycle. Taliesin (Pendragon book 1) was the first books that really evoked an emotional response from me. And I&#39;ve been hooked on the genre ever sense.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Sulcata13"> /u/Sulcata13 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hejebm/how_did_you_get_into_your_favorite_genre/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hejebm/how_did_you_get_into_your_favorite_genre/">[comments]</a></span>
