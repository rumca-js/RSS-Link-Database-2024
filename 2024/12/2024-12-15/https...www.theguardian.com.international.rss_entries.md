## Chelsea see off Brentford but Cucurella’s goal marred by post-match red

<p>Keeping up the pretence that this is no title challenge is becoming harder for Chelsea to maintain. Boosted by Arsenal and Liverpool squandering points on Saturday, Enzo Maresca’s team broke Brentford’s hold over them and delivered in the manner of potential champions by winning a tight game thanks to goals from Marc Cucurella, who was sent off after full time, and Nicolas Jackson.</p><p>No doubt Maresca will stay measured, even after seeing Chelsea end a run of three consecutive home defeats to their neighbours. He will note that Robert Sánchez, so often maligned, had to make a huge save from Christian Nørgaard at 1-0. Fábio Carvalho, the Brentford substitute, then hit the bar during a nervy finale. Bryan Mbeumo halved the deficit in the 90th minute.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/dec/15/chelsea-brentford-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

## James Maddison doubles up in Tottenham’s rout of sorry Southampton

<p>As a battle of the Premier League’s two most idealistic managers, it registered as a no-contest. Such was the dominance of Ange Postecoglou’s version of the glory game over Southampton’s it ended up being a question of exactly when Russell Martin’s misguided evangelism will be discontinued. And not if. Saints’ main contribution to any free-flowing, inventive football was letting Spurs play exactly as they liked.</p><p>In pre-match, there had been insurrection in the ranks of the away support, calling for the departure of Daniel Levy after the chairman was spotted in the stands. If there are doubts in Postecoglou, the fault lines between fan and boardroom run far deeper. Two seasons ago, on Tottenham’s previous Premier League visit to St Mary’s, a rancorous 3-3 draw had preceded Antonio Conte kissing off with a post-match rant for the ages, leaving Levy and the club’s executive class’s ears burning as he took his leave.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/dec/15/

<p>The creators of We Might Regret This, an unflinching and taboo-busting sitcom about a tetraplegic woman and her friend/carer, challenges the perceptions of disability. But this is just the start of their story</p><p>There’s little in their new BBC sitcom, <em>We Might Regret This</em>, its co-creators Kyla Harris and Lee Getty shy away from. Harris also stars in the show, playing Freya – a charismatic, tetraplegic 30-something artist fresh from a transatlantic move to London. In need of a personal care assistant (PA), she turns to Jo (Elena Saurel), her chaotic, impulsive best friend. It doesn’t exactly go well. While storylines are entirely fictionalised, the terrain explored – between PA and care-receiver, yes, but also between friends: one disabled, one not – speaks directly to their experiences. And they don’t hold back.</p><p>Take what’s referred to as “The Shit Scene” in their shared shorthand. A particular on-screen sequence the pair believe gets to the heart of their serie

<p>From celebrity lookalike competitions to biopic casting, we seem to be revealing a modern obsession with similarity</p><p>As Halloween approached, flyers began to appear on lamp-posts and trees in cities across the world. They were printed in black-and-white, with a little face in a square, and they advertised lookalike contests. The first was in New York, where hundreds of Timothée Chalamets congregated in Washington Square Park, with police arriving to disperse the crowd and eventually arrest one contestant just as the real Chalamet arrived. Half a head taller than the contestants and with a little moustache, it appeared he’d come as Charlie Chaplin (who famously once lost a Charlie Chaplin lookalike contest). This was the beginning of the winter of our duplicate. But looking back, hasn’t the whole year been distracted by doubles?</p><p>Lookalike contests were held in Dublin (Paul Mescal), London (Harry Styles), San Francisco (Dev Patel), Chicago (Jeremy Allen White), Brooklyn (

## Queer review – seedily terrific Daniel Craig carries Luca Guadagnino’s artificial-looking drama

<p>The Call Me by Your Name director’s overlong William Burroughs adaptation boasts some fine performances, but any gritty realism feels totally manicured</p><p>The writing of William Burroughs is not for everyone. But even his detractors would agree that he was not in the business of prettification. His loosely autobiographical satires – <em>Junkie</em>, for example, or the novella <em>Queer</em>, which forms the basis for this film – embrace the brutish ugliness of base and animalistic urges. His was a defiantly unsavoury writing voice – prose that was rotten with self-loathing and reeking of stale beer sweat. Whatever else, it came from a place of unvarnished personal truth and authenticity. All of which makes the incongruous approach of Italian director Luca Guadagnino (<em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/nov/18/suspiria-review-mark-kermode-film-of-the-week">Suspiria</a></em>; <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/29/call-me-by-your-name-review-pea

<p>Serve with cold whipped cream for a decadent festive treat that provides a welcome counterpoint to all those heavy puddings and pastries</p><p>At Christmas, there is a much-loved and valued place for raisins and citrus peel steeped in booze and unrefined sugars – stirred into puddings, say, or to fill crumbly, short pastry. Of course, I’m not denying this most obvious fact, but please don’t downplay the pivotal role that chocolate plays in the mix. Too much stewed fruit is dispiriting, but put a bowl of whipped, deeply chocolatey mousse on the table and the world is righted. If we can agree that Christmas is about decadence and indulgence, then we can also agree that a rich, velvety chocolate mousse with boozy things to pour on top is an absolute must.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/dec/15/velvety-chocolate-mousse-boozy-cherries-recipe-thomasina-miers">Continue reading...</a>
