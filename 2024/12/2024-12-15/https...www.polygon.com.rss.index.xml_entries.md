<p class="has-text-align-none">Step Up is more than just the franchise that minted Channing Tatum as a star. It’s more, even, than a franchise that gave us a gem of a sequel subhed.

<p class="has-text-align-none">For <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24156672/polygon-book-year-of-the-ring-pre-order">Peter Jackson’s Lord of the Rings trilogy</a>, screenwriter Philippa Boyens, Jackson, and Fran Walsh took on the task of translating three expansive novels into three live-action movies.
