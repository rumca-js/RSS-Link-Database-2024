<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’m looking for a recommendation on a library/framework, can be python or js, that lets me set a base url, set how many levels deep and maybe a few other basic things and scrapes whatever it can find. </p> <p>But, it would be great if this library also used modern anti detection techniques like smart browser fingerprinting and the of course robust proxy configuration.</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/indicava"> /u/indicava </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1hf0t25/looking_for_an_old_school_scraper_but_with_modern/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1hf0t25/looking_for_an_old_school_scraper_but_with_modern/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all! I am very inexperienced, so appologize if I am asking a silly question. Is it technically possible to build a search engine that tells you what Newsletters a certain email address has subscribed to?</p> <p>I think this could be very beneficial for highly targetted marketing of high ticket sales (e.g. If someone wants to sell their company and wants to advertise to CEOs of companies potentially acquiring their business).</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/pwicki"> /u/pwicki </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1hexbyz/is_this_possible/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1hexbyz/is_this_possible/">[comments]</a></span>
