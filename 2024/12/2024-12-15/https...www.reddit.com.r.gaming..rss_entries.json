A couple of years after the stroke, he attempted to play but felt sick when playing certain games, particularly if there was a lot of action on screen or if it&#39;s too fast paced.</p> <p>He&#39;s recently been mentioning that he&#39;d like to get back into gaming, so I&#39;ve bought him an Xbox Series X for Christmas. Just wondering which games people could recommend for someone who suffers from video motion sickness? I doubt he&#39;d be into games like Stardew Valley or Unpacking, so looking for some options with a bit more excitement but not as intense or fast paced as modern day CoD, if any titles exist!</p> <p>Sorry of this isn&#39;t a lot to go on and feel free to ask for more info!</p> <p>Thank you all so much!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/use",

I enjoyed squadding up, completing the missions against NPCs, helping others complete their missions, progressing through the missions/rewards, and the occasional PVP battle. It&#39;s one of the few games where the randoms you squad with are generally pro-team and want to help each other get things checked off. </p> <p>What Playstation extraction shooter is the most similar to the DMZ experience? I&#39;m not sure if they all have the dual PVE/PVP aspects of DMZ or if most are mainly PVP? For me DMZ was 75% PVE and 25% PVP how I played it and that was cool for me. I know some people played it exclusively to go PVP hunting but that&#39;s not my style and the toxic proximity chat was crazy at times. Is there another game that plays the same with missions, etc. ? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a ",
