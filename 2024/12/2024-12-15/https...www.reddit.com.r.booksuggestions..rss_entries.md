<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I really want to get my Mama a book for Christmas but I’m not really a book person, I just like watching things based on books lol. She loves books set in Southern America like Fried Green Tomatoes (anything from Fannie Flagg really), where the Crawdads Sing, A Colour Purple etc. Olive Kitteridge is also one of her favourite books so you kind of get the idea of the vibes she likes. Does anyone have any recommendations? I would really appreciate it!!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/YourMomStinksOfMkat"> /u/YourMomStinksOfMkat </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1hf2vt5/books_set_in_southern_america/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1hf2vt5/books_set_in_southern_america/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m an English teacher. A girl in my class handed me a novel she had written, almost 35 000 words long. She&#39;s tomboyish, loves music, plays guitar and she&#39;s a swing dancer.</p> <p>Her novel is about a boy that gets raised by the leader of a city. Once his adopted father dies, the boy is able to barter a peace between his home city and the nearby wealthier city state, by showing both sides how cooperation is mutually beneficial.</p> <p>It&#39;s more alternate history than sci-fi or fantasy. The only fantastical element is a drug that can keep a deadly infection at bay and gives the user an inflated sense of self.</p> <p>The book is obviously written by a young person, especially towards the end, where most of the political drama gets abandoned by a very cringe romance. I am going to tell her to include the love interest earlier on in the story and tie her into the plot.</p> <p>Still, the book is very well written for a fourteen year old. I

I&#39;m heavily interested in psychological horror, things that are just strange and creepy appearing at first but later reveal themselves to be extremely deep and profound and leave me with layers of melancholy. They&#39;re not actually about ghosts, or anything supernatural but reflect upon something prevalent in the society, humanity, mental illness etc.. it could have an open-ended ending or some body horror, romance, suicide sci fi etc. With the sadness and melancholy aspect, I&#39;d want something like the Ghibli move &quot;Grave of the Fireflies&quot; or something more relatable like &quot;100 centimetres per second&quot;. Maybe it could be like Junji Ito&#39;s works? Idk Sidenote but I also really like the psychological horror indie games, things like mouthwashing, doki doki literature club and silent hill Sorry if my though

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m looking for a book with a mmc like Rigel; would die for her, possessive, tortured soul, wants to protect her from himself, etc. Preferably set in highschool. I don&#39;t like mafia books or sports romances, so not that lol. Spice is also preferred. I love the sombre, gloomy vibes of The Tearsmith. I can give more details if there are questions on what I&#39;m looking for lol.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/trollbellygem"> /u/trollbellygem </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1heib8v/looking_for_a_book_like_the_tearsmith/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1heib8v/looking_for_a_book_like_the_tearsmith/">[comments]</a></span>

## Books with themes of women and reproductive justice, similar to A Thousand Splendid Suns

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am hoping to find something with similar themes as Khaled Hosseini&#39;s A Thousand Splendid Suns; a story that centres on women and their experiences with pregnancy, childbirth, forced reproduction, domestic violence etc. I want it to lean into the themes of sisterhood (like between Laila and Mariam) and explore the struggles of women in countries where women&#39;s rights are nonexistent and reproduction is used as a form of control. Sorry if this request doesn&#39;t make sense and thanks in advance!! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Low_Cry_9004"> /u/Low_Cry_9004 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1hei2yh/books_with_themes_of_women_and_reproductive/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1hei2yh/books_with_themes_of_women_and_reproductive/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello All,</p> <p>I am in dire need of a book to read, as I am about to proctor 2 two-hour final exams, where I do nothing but sit and read while the students take their exam. (This is for a Philosophy course, by the way.)</p> <p>I am out of authors. I recently re-read Kurt Vonnegut for the nth time, as well as Douglas Adams. I read an old Neil Stephenson novel called, <em>The Big U</em>, which was cool at first but about halfway through turned into an almost unreadable mix of sci-fi, fantasy, and college satire. I looked at his other novels and none seemed interesting for to me to read.</p> <p>I&#39;ve read Tom Robbins - too sexualized for me.</p> <p>I&#39;ve read a lot of non-fiction over the last 10+ years (including Philosophy, Biology, and History), but am slowly getting back into fiction. But I am at a total loss. I was an English minor, so I got exposed to some great authors, and some not-so-great ones. Joseph Hellinger and <em>Catch-22</em>,
