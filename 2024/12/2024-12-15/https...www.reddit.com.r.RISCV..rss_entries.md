<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>It has been over 2 years since India announced RISC-V roadmap in 2022. What does the scene look like today? Are there any companies working in this space? Is there a low cost board for data logging? Is there a plan for high-performance board which can make it into kids laptop? Do they support TLS encrypted communication?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Jazzlike_770"> /u/Jazzlike_770 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1heysnj/risc_v_scene_in_in_india/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1heysnj/risc_v_scene_in_in_india/">[comments]</a></span>

It includes all the cables you need to connect it to the motherboard of a desktop PC for USB, power, reset, etc., and a half-height bracket. It also includes a micro-SD card with the software already installed, very nice. The two USB type-A to type-C cables I received were both <em>defective</em>, the NanoKVM failed to ennumerate with either one.</p> <p><strong>First Use:</strong> I didn&#39;t install into a PC yet. While it can be powered from the motherboard, you can also supply power externally, and there is a separate USB connector for HID (mouse and keyboard). The HDMI cable
