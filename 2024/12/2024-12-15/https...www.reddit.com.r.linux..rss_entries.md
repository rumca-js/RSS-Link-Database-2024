<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have 2 ssd’s with me. I installed Cachyos on SSD1, spent weeks setting it up with all my workspace requirements. I wanted to have another cachy os on SSD2 for my dad, so plugged the pendrive and did the installation. I very carefully selected the SSD2 in the launcher, and very carefully selected the partition where I want it to get installed, installation went well. But now I am unable to select SSD1 and boot into it, SSD2 has now becomes the only bootable device. SSD1 is not visible in the boot loader list anymore. I used systemd (which is default) and btrfs if that’s relevant.</p> <p>Suggestions please. Thank you for your time.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/wolfisraging"> /u/wolfisraging </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1hf0oxs/unable_to_boot_in_ssd_1_with_cachyos_after/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1hf0oxs/

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>We all know how capable the command line is and many of us even prefer it over graphical apps. But anyway there is no harm in having more options, and I think it&#39;s ok to prefer GUIs for all or certain tasks, even for advanced system administration, monitoring and the like. What is one area you wish to see more gui options for?
