<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been looking for a good music streaming app outside the usual suspects on Android but so far I haven&#39;t found much. Gyawun seemed cool but you can&#39;t shuffle playlists, or at least I haven&#39;t found a way to do so. Right now YouTube Music Vanced is acting pretty erratic so I&#39;m trying to find something else. I mean, this is a pretty standard feature so there&#39;s got to be something right? I tried XManager but I can&#39;t even get past the main screen with the list of patches and such.
