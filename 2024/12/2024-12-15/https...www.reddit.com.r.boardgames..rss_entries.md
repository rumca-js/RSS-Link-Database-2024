<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Dear All. I&#39;ve been looking at this game for a long time because of the theme. So, I&#39;m ready to give it a chance, but wanted to listen impressions from theouse who plays / played the game in regards of two things:</p> <p>1) How do you find pre-build decks? I don&#39;t have plans to collect cards, build my own decks, etc. I&#39;d enjoy default decks / scenarios and question is if it is enjoyable.</p> <p>and</p> <p>2) If it indeed allows to create a story? Like RPG like expierence? Considering that I have a group that has creativity willing to implement it during the game.</p> <p>What do you think?

I want to try to condense down the ~400 page rule book into about 50 so that my group can actually try to play a full game. Do you think that feasible for one person to actually do? I’ve skim read all the rules and to me it seems like I can just cut out loads of stuff and barely anything will change, but I want the opinion of others first, and also I feel like it goes against the spirit of the board game. The only reason it’s in anyway famous is because of its extreme length and complexity, and turning it into a more complex HOI4 seems like an insult to the creator. What are your opinions on this?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Prize-Nothing7946"> /u/Prize-Nothing7946 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/
