<p class="has-text-align-none">Days before the final episode of <em>Survivor</em>’s 47th season, gaming company Exploding Kittens announced <em>Survivor The Tribe Has Spoken</em>, a new card-based party game designed in collaboration with the show’s Emmy Award-winning host and producer Jeff Probst. Designed for both superfans and the uninitiated alike, the <em>Survivor</em> card game attempts to mirror the social strategy the genre-defining reality show has become famous for. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is not the first licensed game by the Exploding Kittens team — having released <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Exploding-Minions-Card-Game-Activities/dp/B0D2FNTT99">Exploding Minions</a></em> in 2021 — but

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Viper Napuatzi</strong> is a boss in <em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/path-of-exile-2/445409">Path of Exile 2</a></em>’s third act. Located in Utzaal, Napuatzi deploys a variety of poison attacks in an extremely small arena, forcing you into a claustrophobic fight.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Viper Napuatzi may not be as complex or overwhelming as some of the other fights in Act 2 or Act 3, but the limited size of the arena and the power of poison makes her extremely deadly. This is especially true when she uses a number of core moves in quick succession to cover the arena in poison or pin you in a corner. </p>
