## Choosing the right format for USB flash drives matters. Here’s why

<p>Technically, it has never been a problem to format USB drives with a storage capacity of more than 32GB with the FAT32 file system. Only Windows itself has never been able to do this, so you always have to resort to external tools.</p>



<p>This is set to change in the future. </p>



<p>Last summer, Microsoft announced that the operating system’s internal format command would also support storage media up to 2TB with FAT32. Compared to the previous 32GB limit, this is more than 60 times as much.</p>



<p>Although the new function is currently only available in some Insider pre-release versions of Windows 11, if it runs smoothly in the preview builds, it will be included in the normal operating system in the coming months. </p>

<p>While traveling this holiday season, security is probably the last thing on your mind—outside of keeping your laptop from being stolen. But snoops can be as much of a problem as thieves.</p>



<p>Fortunately, it takes just seconds to lock down your PC whenever you want to step away. Just press these two keys: <strong>Win + L</strong>. Anyone who wants access to your computer will then need to unlock it for use. </p>



<p>If <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2466412/why-you-should-be-using-windows-hello-to-secure-your-pc.html">you’ve set up Windows Hello</a>, securing your PC before you step away won’t be inconvenient. You’ll be able to quickly get back into your account with biometrics (when supported by your computer hardware) or a PIN. </p>



<p>I personally like this shortcut best since I have full control and am guaranteed the PC is locked. S

<p>I’m a standing desk evangelist. I believe in standing desks so much that if you and I were to meet and get talking and I were to find out you work at a desk, I’d try to convince you to <em>stand</em> at it instead.</p>



<p>I stand almost all day, swaying and rocking on my two feet like a silly person to keep my posture upright and to keep my deep veins from thrombosing. You’d never find me in an office chair, let alone one of those premium office chairs that cost upwards of a grand.</p>



<p>So, when Sihoo asked me to check out their <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SIHOO-Doro-C300-Pro-Ultra-Soft/dp/B0CW1JKB4F/">Doro C300 Pro office chair</a> with a $700 MSRP, I told the lovely PR rep not to bother. I wouldn’t use it, I told them. But they insisted, so I acquiesced… and now here I am.</p>



<p>I’m sitting in Sihoo’s Doro C300 Pro as I write this. A chai
