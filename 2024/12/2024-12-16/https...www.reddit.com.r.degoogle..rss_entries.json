The power button doesn&#39;t work well anymore and the pictures are subpar, in addition to lacking wireless charging and just being too big for my taste (6.5 inches, why did I ever think that was reasonable). I do very much like LineageOS, so I&#39;m looking for a refurbished phone I can flash a new ROM on.</p> <p>I am leaning to the Galaxy S23 or S24 depending on availability, but I&#39;m wondering what the options are for newer Samsung devices and if those options will have (at least security) updates for the next 5+ years. Otherwise the Pixel 8 with GrapheneOS looks like a good option, but it seems quite ironic to buy a Google device when I&#39;m trying to deGoogle as much as reasonably possible.</p> <p>What are your experiences with custom ROMs on new Samsung devices? Is it worth it, or should I consider the Pixel 8 instead?</p> </div><!-",
