That video got me wondering, is there an equivalent to this genre in Fantasy? To clarify, I don&#39;t mean something like Weird West stories, where it&#39;s the wild West but with magical stuff. What I mean is, stories that take place in fantasy settings, that borrow tropes, themes, and motifs of the Western Genre. The only example I can think of off the top of my head is the Nomad of Nowhere. If I haven&#39;t explained myself well enough, I will happily try to make it more clear if needed.

If two people tell me, it\u2019s added to my TBR. Three or more people and my suddenly hackles raise, I grow skeptical of anyone and everyone, and I\u2019m ready to write up a 1-star review of the thing. But that\u2019s between me and my therapist. All of this to say I went into Dungeon Crawler Carl (DCC) skeptical, thinking it was probably overhyped.</p> <p>Nope!</p> <p>I don\u2019t really know how to best pitch this series. What works for me best is how it feels almost like an update on the Hunger Games - a deadly game competition that also manages to poke fun at the ridiculously callous nature of modern media. For DCC, this starts to go more towards the reality TV side of things, using some of the behind-the-scenes natures of such show as part of the commentary and plot.</p> <p>It also takes aspects from RPGs like Dungeons and Dragons or MMOs like World of Warcraft and us",

Were they trying to kill the Kadoshim permanently in the real world since they were made flesh? If so why did they need a distraction? Asroth would know the Ben-Elim could follow him anyway, so it should have been no surprise they came. </p> <p>2) What was the point of destroying the cauldron and other treasures? At that point both Ben-Elim and Kadoshim were already through to the real world. If they died their souls were gone for good, not sent back like the possessed Jehar. Destroying the cauldron served no purpose other than encasing Asroth which I&#39;m assuming is teeing up the sequels. </p> <p>3) W",

I haven&#39;t read any of Gwynne&#39;s other stuff, so I was considering starting his previous series. Just wanna hear peoples&#39; thoughts before I spend time on it, though. Is it similar? Better? Worse? I really enjoyed his pacing in the Bloodsworn books and the way pretty much anyone could die. There wasn&#39;t a lot of plot armor.</p> <p>And on that note, if not The Faithful and the Fallen, any other recs if I like the Bloodsworn series?
