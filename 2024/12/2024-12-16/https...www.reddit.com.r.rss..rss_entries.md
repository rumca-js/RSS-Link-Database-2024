<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello I wonder if somebody can help me, I set up an RSS feed from SoundCloud to Apple, many years ago, and now I want to change the image that is shown on the Apple podcasts, but I cannot see anywhere I can change this image, I donâ€™t see anywhere in the SoundCloud preferences to do this, and there is nothing in the Apple podcast area, any advice would be much appreciated. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/HelpImpossible5158"> /u/HelpImpossible5158 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1hfrctv/help_needed_rssapple/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1hfrctv/help_needed_rssapple/">[comments]</a></span>

## I've been trying to find an app that combines feeds and from the the different news apps that I'm subscribed to. A one stop shop kind of thing. Anyone knows about something similar. I'd really appreciate it.
