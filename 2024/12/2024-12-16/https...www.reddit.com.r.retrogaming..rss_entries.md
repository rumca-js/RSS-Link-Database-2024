<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Didn&#39;t grow up in the 8 bit era, never owned a NES controller till I was 30 this year.</p> <p>The controller is just so damn precise. I feel like I&#39;m dancing ballet with enemies in Zelda now when before on my Xbox controller everything just felt worse.</p> <p>Cant be nostalgia, so anyone else in my age range with this experience?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Onmius"> /u/Onmius </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1hf6ffi/no_nostalgia_first_console_was_n64_love_the/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1hf6ffi/no_nostalgia_first_console_was_n64_love_the/">[comments]</a></span>
