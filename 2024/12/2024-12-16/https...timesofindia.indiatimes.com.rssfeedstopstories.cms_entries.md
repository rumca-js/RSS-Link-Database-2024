In The Wolf of Wall Street, drugs fueled excess and chaos; today, Wall Street’s drugs drive hyper-productivity. Adderall, the go-to stimulant, powers young bankers through 90-hour weeks, while Vyvanse offers smoother, longer-lasting focus.

When prescriptions fail, desperate bankers turn to the risky underground market, risking counterfeit pills laced with fentanyl. These substances help junior bankers survive relentless workloads, but at a steep cost: burnout, dependency, and lost humanity. The grind continues, but the drugs have evolved—along with the toll.
