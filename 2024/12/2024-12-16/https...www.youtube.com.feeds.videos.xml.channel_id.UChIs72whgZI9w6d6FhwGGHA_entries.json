There are seemingly endless coolers, and we know we haven't gotten to all of them this (or any) year, so we're basing this off of what we've tested for 2024. The round-up includes the best CPU coolers for value, budget, noise-normalized thermals in both air and liquid categories (since they are in different classes), best mechanical design, and best overall. Thermalright took the industry by storm in the past few years with its onslaught of cheap (but good) air coolers, and now, multiple others are trying to get in on the party. That includes Arctic with its Freezer 36 and ID-Cooling with its A720 and SE-214-XT coolers.
