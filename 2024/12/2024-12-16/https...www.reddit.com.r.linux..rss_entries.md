<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Watch too much YouTube? Battery life poor under Linux? Fan running too often? If you answered yes to all of these, it might be because Firefox is not using your GPU properly.</p> <p>YouTube tends to use the AV1 and VP9 codecs and, if you don&#39;t see happy green when you scroll about half way down in about:support to Media for Hardware Decoding for these, your CPU is working hard doing stuff your GPU was specifically designed for.</p> <p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/ql2lrz9pn97e1.png?width=1006&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d142c4554ec47df1b09a2c32ecb0f53a092a5a3c">https://preview.redd.it/ql2lrz9pn97e1.png?width=1006&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d142c4554ec47df1b09a2c32ecb0f53a092a5a3c</a></p> <p>The fix? Simple. In about:config, toggle media.ffmpeg.vaapi.enabled so it&#39;s true.</p> <p>Once I made this change, and restarted Firefox, my CPU usage dropped by half whenever I watched a YouTube video.</p> <p>Hope this helps someone else!

I’ve used all three operating systems and still do and I see many people complain about aspects primarily with Windows which I’ve personally never experienced other than the ads. </p> <p>Even then, while I 100% agree that an OS you PAID for should not have ads, ive never been necessarily bothered by them. They’re just there but never have I felt like they obstruct anything </p> <p>I also see some people talk about random reboots for updates in the middle of doing work or playing a game. I’ve genuinely never experienced this in my life. </p> <p>Only one I tend to agree with as of now is the recall feature being shit. I’m not too worried since I don’t have a copilot+ PC/ laptop but still something I’m staying up to date on since that would most definitely be the deal breaker for me if it were ever able to run on my machine </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Professio
