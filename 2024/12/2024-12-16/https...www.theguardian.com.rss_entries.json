        "description": "<p>Bournemouth simply do not know when they are beaten. The substitute Enes Unal powered an unstoppable free-kick into the top corner, seconds after West Ham snatched an unlikely lead courtesy of a contentious penalty. Another Bournemouth substitute, Tyler Adams, was penalised for handling Aaron Wan-Bissaka\u2019s cross from the right and Lucas Paquet\u00e1 converted the subsequent spot-kick, awarded following a VAR review.</p><p>Lopetegui insisted the uplift from a welcome victory at home to Wolves had been forgotten as West Ham targeted back-to-back league wins for the first time this season. The West Ham manager made two changes, one enforced with Emerson suspended, so Wan-Bissaka shifted to left-back and Vladimir Coufal came into the starting lineup at right-back. Lucas Paquet\u00e1, who has struggled for form, was a surprise inclusion in place of Crysencio Summerville.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/dec/16/bournemouth-west-ham-premier-league-match-report\">Continue readi",

However, there is a science behind it too. Being in groups A or B means you have more rest in between matches and more time to recover for the knockout fixtures. Group A\u2019s winners generally tend to have the kindest knockout pathway too.

        "description": "<p>The general population needs far less protein than is often made out by influencers. Don\u2019t miss out on other important aspects of your diet</p><p>This is a myth, says Bethan Crouse, a&nbsp;performance nutritionist from Loughborough University. She says that while the protein macromolecules \u2013 which are most abundant in meat, dairy and some legumes \u2013 are an important nutrient for repairing and maintaining muscle, the general population needs far less than is often made out by fitness influencers pushing high-protein recipes.</p><p>For the average person, the recommended daily allowance is 0.75g of protein for every kg of body weight. For a 65kg (143lb) person that might mean eating a chicken breast, 200g (7oz) of Greek yoghurt and an egg (57g of protein). That figure rises slightly if you work out. \u201cThe average couch-to-5K runner might need 1.2g per kg,\u201d she says. If you are trying to build muscle then that could rise to 1.8-2.0g per kg.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/life",
