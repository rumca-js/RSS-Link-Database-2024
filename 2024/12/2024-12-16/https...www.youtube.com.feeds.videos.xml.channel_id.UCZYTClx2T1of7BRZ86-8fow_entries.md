This video was made in collaboration with Seafood Watch, a program of the Monterey Bay Aquarium. Seafood Watch takes a scientific approach to assess the environmental sustainability of seafood sold on the U.S. market and then uses those findings to transform how seafood is fished and farmed around the globe. Go to https://www.seafoodwatch.org/guides to get started.
