The movie has great humor, rarely is a joke just a flat out dud, I laughed out loud several times (which takes a lot) the story is heartwarming, everyone including a bunch of child actors does a great job. For me, this will be a new Christmas classic I&#39;ll probably watch every year. I related to a ton of it and it&#39;s got so many quick subtle jokes that I&#39;ll probably find something new to laugh at every time. </p> <p>I highly recommend this if you want a new Christmas movie that doesn&#39;t suck. I think even kids would enjoy it. Get yo",

In fact, I watched 505 as I also viewed a few bonus movies.</p> <p>I built the list from Best Picture winners from the big award shows. (Academy Awards, BAFTA, Screen Actors Guild, etc.) I also used every \u201cTop 100\u201d list I could find, and even used a helpful post here on Reddit that compiled the top 250 based on users scores, which helped find foreign movies.</p> <p>I made a rule for myself that I had to finish every movie, even if I hated it. (Which gave me the chance to change my mind on a few, like \u201cHoly Motors,\u201d etc.)</p> <p>So, here\u2019s my Top 5 from each decade, except the 20s which only got 4, and the 2000s, which had too many great movies and gets 11.

They have a love-hate relationship in which Kate (O&#39;Hara) always sees the bad in Kevin (Macaulay Culkin), because he&#39;s a kid who allows his emotions to get the best of him when he&#39;s bullied by Buzz or cursed at by his no good Uncle, but she also has a lot of love for him.

In Megalopolis, Wow, Julia, and Vesta all sleep and/or want to sleep with Ceasar. - In Double Down, Niel Breen has constant flashbacks to his dead girlfriend. In Megalopolis, there are four random flashbacks to Caesar&#39;s dead wife. - In Breens movies, there are many disjoint plots taking place simultaneously. In Megalopolis, there is the plot between Caesar and Cicero amd the bank takeover plot with Wow and Shia Labeouf to name two. - In Breens movies, Breen is always endowed with supernatural power. One of the biggest selling points of Megalopolis is that Caesar has the power to stop time among others. - In Breens movies, the villains/antagoni",

Looking at his filmography, he was productive from 1961-1975, but after that he became more inconsistent with his projects, pretty much taking years before he does one.</p> <p>From what I read, Beatty was a bit of a perfectionist and to the detriment of the crew, who takes his time and was go multitude of takes.</p> <p>I will say, I think Bonnie &amp; Clyde, Reds, &amp; Bulworth are masterpieces, and Dick Tracy is fun. However, he is also notable for some real stinkers, Ishtar is middling but it really tanked his image. Town &amp; Country is bad and it pretty much put him into exile and Rules Don&#39;t Apply, his comeback, reaffirmed that exile.</p> <p>O",

She gives each of the twins subtle characteristics that make them feel like 2 completely different people. I mean they actually felt like real twin girls, who were separated at birth. The way she gives the one twin certain mannerisms, to distinguish the two apart is so cool. Not a single time during my viewing was I confused at which \u201ctwin\u201d was on my screen. The fact that it was her first movie is insane to me. It was a performance way beyond her years. </p> <p>Every single line delivery of hers is incredible.

I wanted the film to explore every inch of its tale, show me as many parts of its universe as possible and meet more characters to learn about their story.</p> <p>It was the most innocent but still a very true and sometimes hard hitting story about the meaning of death for both sides, the living and the dead. It&#39;s pretty awesome how Pixar managed to get those very dark and adult themes told in a movie mainly aimed at a very young audience. </p> <p>Also, the movie looks beautiful.
