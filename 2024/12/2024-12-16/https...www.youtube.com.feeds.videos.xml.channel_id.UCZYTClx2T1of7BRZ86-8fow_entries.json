        "description": "This video was made in collaboration with Seafood Watch, a program of the Monterey Bay Aquarium. Seafood Watch takes a scientific approach to assess the environmental sustainability of seafood sold on the U.S. market and then uses those findings to transform how seafood is fished and farmed around the globe. Go to https://www.seafoodwatch.org/guides to get started.\n\nWhen fishermen cast their nets, they often catch a lot more than the species they're after. Those unlucky creatures are called bycatch, and it's a huge problem in the industry. Fortunately, scientists have been working hard to solve it with high-tech nets and other innovations. \n\nHosted by: Savannah Geary (they/them)\n----------\nSupport us for $8/month on Patreon and keep SciShow going!\nhttps://www.patreon.com/scishow\nOr support us directly: https://complexly.com/support\nJoin our SciShow email list to get the latest news and highlights: \nhttps://mailchi.mp/scishow/email\n----------\nHuge thanks go to the following Patreon su",
