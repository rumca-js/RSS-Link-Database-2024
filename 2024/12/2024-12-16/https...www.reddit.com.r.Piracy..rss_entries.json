So I wanted to mess a little and have fun testing some software and burning Anime/Idol BDMV. Tried ashampoo, nero and dvdfab. SO far had the best success with dvdfab as all discs are playable on xsx but it&#39;s using BD-J which causes issues. Nevertheless, my question is as follows: Where are you getting your BDMV sources if any1 even bothers with burning BD discs? Nyaa has some collection but I wonder if there is maybe some community or other places dedicated to Burning BDMV discs instead of just BD rips ?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Kriss_Hietala\"> /u/Kriss_Hietala </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1hflti4/bdmv_sources/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1hflti4/bdmv_sources/\">[c",
