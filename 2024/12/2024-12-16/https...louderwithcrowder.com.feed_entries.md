But also according to the left, trans women are women. And also according to the left, women’s sports exist. However, it’s unclear why it exists when trans women are women and no one can even determine what a woman is. </p><p>It does not take a lot to beat the left at their own game, as they are not beholden to logic or reason. Subsequently, Ted Cruz demolished a woke witness who could not define anything she claimed to defend.</p><p><br/></p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">“Why do women’s sports exist?

They do this to confuse, mislead, and gaslight the masses in an attempt to bring their woke revolution to fruition. And given that the left is so pathetic, they cannot handle basic words like “women.” This is why they have decided that third graders should be brainwashed into believing “womyn” is an actual word, even though it makes no sense. </p>
