        "description": "Sitcoms have been around for nearly a century.  Shows like I Love Lucy, All in the Family, Friends, The Office, Parks and Rec, It's Always Sunny, Scrubs, 30 Rock and countless others have entertained audiences on TV for nearly a century.   Though with recent trends in awards voting, it seems the typical sitcom has fallen off for more subversive shows in the genre.  With shows like The Bear, Hacks, Barry and Atlanta sneaking into the Best Comedy category, it begs the question, can sitcoms just be funny anymore?   \n\n#sitcom #emmys #theoffice #thebear #abbottelementary #itsalwayssunnyinphiladelphia",
