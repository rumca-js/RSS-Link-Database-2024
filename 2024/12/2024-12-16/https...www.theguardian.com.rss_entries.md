## Enes Unal’s stunning free-kick earns Bournemouth point against West Ham

<p>Bournemouth simply do not know when they are beaten. The substitute Enes Unal powered an unstoppable free-kick into the top corner, seconds after West Ham snatched an unlikely lead courtesy of a contentious penalty. Another Bournemouth substitute, Tyler Adams, was penalised for handling Aaron Wan-Bissaka’s cross from the right and Lucas Paquetá converted the subsequent spot-kick, awarded following a VAR review.</p><p>Lopetegui insisted the uplift from a welcome victory at home to Wolves had been forgotten as West Ham targeted back-to-back league wins for the first time this season. The West Ham manager made two changes, one enforced with Emerson suspended, so Wan-Bissaka shifted to left-back and Vladimir Coufal came into the starting lineup at right-back. Lucas Paquetá, who has struggled for form, was a surprise inclusion in place of Crysencio Summerville.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/dec/16/bournemouth-west-ham-premier-league-match-report">Continue readi

<p>Holliday Grainger and Tom Burke are excellent again as detectives on the tail of a killer. But given the impenetrable source material and workaday plot, it’s shrug-worthy TV at best</p><p>Is Robin Ellacott in love with Cormoran Strike? “I definitely don’t want to be,” says Robin (Holliday Grainger) of her friend and private-investigator business partner. “That’d screw everything up.” In the sixth season of Strike, a crime drama based on the sixth Strike novel by Robert Galbraith, AKA JK Rowling, it feels more than ever as though the show itself is afraid that this is true. Grainger and Tom Burke, who plays the titular Strike, do a lovely line in will-they-won’t-they romance, but the series might expire if that ever resolved itself, because the sleuthing part of it is moribund already.</p><p>As a work of crime fiction, the TV version of Strike is several removes from having a compelling reason to exist. It is based on a series of hit novels – fine, nearly all detective dramas are –

The same, sadly, cannot be said for Russell Martin, whose fanatical zealotry when it came to making Southampton play football in what he perceived to be The Right Way when almost all available evidence suggested it was the wrong way, has finally cost him his job after his side suffered a humiliating home defeat at the hands of Tottenham at St Mary’s on Monday night.</p><p>Many Manchester City fans are seeing their team’s present predicament as virtually the end of the world (or at least the end of an era) while others, clearly in denial, regard the last 10 games a

<p>Misinformation about health, nutrition and food are rampant on social media. For people prone to eating disorders, this can lead down a dangerous path</p><p>Weeks after giving birth to my son in early 2022, I found a lump in my breast. After an ultrasound, it was deemed suspicious and required a biopsy. The two-week wait for results was terrifying, not least because I have a family history of breast cancer. The chronic eczema I have always suffered from flared up, thanks to stress, sleep deprivation and the upheaval of early parenthood.</p><p>The lump turned out to be benign, but the experience brought my mortality into sharp relief and my anxiety levels to new highs. After treating my skin with round after round of prescription medication, to little avail, I became committed to “naturally” curing the eczema, staving off disease and perfecting my already cautious diet.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2024/dec/16/food-nutrition-misinformation-social-media">Continu

However, there is a science behind it too. Being in groups A or B means you have more rest in between matches and more time to recover for the knockout fixtures. Group A’s winners generally tend to have the kindest knockout pathway too.

You can then play “spot the young Mischa Barton” in a number of films. In the famous scene in Notting Hill where Hugh Grant hasn’t seen the film and then has to interview the cast at the press junket, it is Barton who plays the young child actor who has already appeared in 22 films, her favourite with Leonardo DiCaprio. (“Is he your favourite Italian director?” asks Hugh.)

<p>It is probably wrong to touch, even gently, a sea anemone. But even now, I find it difficult to resist</p><p>In her book Theatres of Glass, Rebecca Stott writes about the Victorian craze for home aquariums – which swept London in the 1850s, with people taking animals from the seaside and making miniature rock pools at home in large glass enclosures or pie dishes. The craze did not last long; people didn’t have a way to oxygenate the water and most of what they collected died. <br><br>
 But among the people who loved the idea that you could create a rock pool at home was Mary Ann Evans – who wrote as George Eliot. She and her partner, the philosopher and critic George Henry Lewes, spent two summers hunting sea anemones in the town of Ilfracombe, where they were “absolutely fascinated” by what they saw, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/b05w9dxn">says Stott</a>.

The royal surgeon <a href="https://hekint.org/2019/10/31/it-is-good-to-be-the-king-the-french-surgical-revolution/">Charles-François Félix</a> invented a curved silver scalpel to get at the fistula – you can see it in this glittering science history blockbuster – and practised on local paupers, killing several.

From ready meals to breakfast cereals, these foods are engineered for convenience and taste – but at what cost?

Before taking to the opposite dugout on Sunday, Matt Beard, the Liverpool head coach, lauded her for doing “a fantastic job” and said it would be “great for the game” were she to stay on permanently; afterwards, Alessia Russo, the match-winner, credited Slegers with instilling fresh motivation in the team. Arsenal were far from perfect against Liverpool but, in grinding out a 1-0 win on Merseyside, showed a resilience that was lacking under Jonas Eidevall at the start of the season.

Austere, beautiful structures transform and rotate at the player’s touch, creating new paths and staircases for its minimalist characters to traverse. Doorways can lead anywhere. Switches cause columns to rise out of the ground, a perspective shift can reveal a cache of hidden pathways. Since 2014 these games have been smartphone must-plays, one of the best and most elegant examples of satisfying touch-screen puzzlers. But the third in the series, released last week, is a little different.</p><p>The Moroccan-inspired architecture that made the game famous is still present, but this time your geometric character Noor walks alongside blooming flowers and twisting vines, too. She sails a small boat. She gets lost in fields of bright yellow wheat. And there are many more people around her: she is a light

## Is it true that … most of us aren’t getting enough protein?

<p>The general population needs far less protein than is often made out by influencers. Don’t miss out on other important aspects of your diet</p><p>This is a myth, says Bethan Crouse, a&nbsp;performance nutritionist from Loughborough University. She says that while the protein macromolecules – which are most abundant in meat, dairy and some legumes – are an important nutrient for repairing and maintaining muscle, the general population needs far less than is often made out by fitness influencers pushing high-protein recipes.</p><p>For the average person, the recommended daily allowance is 0.75g of protein for every kg of body weight. For a 65kg (143lb) person that might mean eating a chicken breast, 200g (7oz) of Greek yoghurt and an egg (57g of protein). That figure rises slightly if you work out. “The average couch-to-5K runner might need 1.2g per kg,” she says. If you are trying to build muscle then that could rise to 1.8-2.0g per kg.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/life
