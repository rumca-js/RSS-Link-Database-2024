## Does the exoplanet Trappist-1 b have an atmosphere after all?

Recent measurements with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) cast doubt on the current understanding of the exoplanet Trappist-1 b's nature. Until now, it was assumed to be a dark rocky planet without an atmosphere, shaped by a billion-year-long cosmic impact of radiation and meteorites. The opposite appears to be true. The surface shows no signs of weathering, which could indicate geological activity such as volcanism and plate tectonics. Alternatively, a planet with a hazy atmosphere composed of carbon dioxide is also viable. The results demonstrate the challenges of determining the properties of exoplanets with thin atmospheres.

## Unlocking the journey of gold through magmatic fluids

When one tectonic plate sinks beneath another, it generates magmas rich in volatiles such as water, sulphur and chlorine. As these magmas ascend, they release magmatic fluids, in which sulphur and chlorine bind to metals such as gold and copper, and transport these metals towards the surface of the Earth. As the extreme conditions relevant to natural magmas are very difficult to reproduce in the laboratory, the precise role of the different forms of sulphur in metal transport remains highly debated. However, an innovative approach has demonstrated that sulphur, in its bisulphide (HS-) form, is crucial for the transport of gold in magmatic fluids.

How does the Earth generate its magnetic field? While the basic mechanisms seem to be understood, many details remain unresolved. A team of researchers has introduced a simulation method that promises new insights into the Earth's core. The method simulates not only the behavior of atoms, but also the magnetic properties of materials. The approach is significant for geophysics, but could also support the development of future technologies such as neuromorphic computing -- an innovative approach to more efficient AI systems.

Craniopharyngiomas are brain tumors that negatively impact the hormonal function of the nearby pituitary. The tumor location often prevents necessary surgical intervention. Alternative pharmacological therapy requires an in-depth understanding of the tumor molecular characteristics. To address this gap, researchers analyzed gene expression within individual tumor cells. This study reports the molecular features and interactions of tumor and immune cells associated with two craniopharyngioma subtypes that will help identify future targeted therapeutics.

## Flavonoid powerhouse: Kaempferol's role in taming allergic responses

Food allergies affect millions of people worldwide, and flavonoids are promising natural compounds to help modulate the immune response and treat inflammation caused by these allergies. In a recent study, researchers have identified that kaempferol, a flavonoid, produces an anti-inflammatory effect through regulatory T-cell development. This occurred through increased RADLH2 expression in dendritic cells via AhR-mediated and PU.1/IRF-4 dependent mechanisms. Additionally, kaempferol suppressed several allergic symptoms in mice with food allergies.

A study is the first-of-its-kind to recognize American Sign Language (ASL) alphabet gestures using computer vision. Researchers developed a custom dataset of 29,820 static images of ASL hand gestures. Each image was annotated with 21 key landmarks on the hand, providing detailed spatial information about its structure and position. Combining MediaPipe and YOLOv8, a deep learning method they trained, with fine-tuning hyperparameters for the best accuracy, represents a groundbreaking and innovative approach that hasn't been explored in previous research.

On February 2, 1887, residents of Punxsutawney Pennsylvania consulted a large rodent regarding the arrival of spring, marking the first official celebration of Groundhog Day. Our ability to predict the timing of seasons hasn't improved much since then, but a new study is set to make seasonal forecasting a lot more reliable.

Prostate cancer, especially in advanced stages such as castration-resistant prostate cancer, is challenging to treat. Traditional therapies targeting androgen receptor (AR) signaling have limited efficacy. In a recent study, researchers investigated the potential of azolato-bridged dinuclear platinum(II) complexes, particularly 5-H-Y, as promising alternatives. Their findings highlight the complex's ability to inhibit AR signaling and induce cell death in prostate cancer cells, providing a new avenue for prostate cancer treatment.

New research shows that many wildlife species in the U.S., like the endangered giant kangaroo rat, will face much more frequent and severe droughts in the future. By 2050-2080, year-long droughts could happen almost five times as often, and three-year droughts almost seven times as often compared to past decades. These changes will require animals to adapt significantly. Scientists have identified areas with high biodiversity and high risk that can help managers focus attention for conservation efforts. The southwestern U.S. is a critical area where many species will be more affected by increased droughts.

In the U.S., atrial fibrillation (AF), a heart condition that causes an irregular heartbeat in the upper chambers of the heart, affects up to one in three people in their lifetime. Significant complications associated with this condition include ischemic stroke, heart failure, myocardial infarction, chronic kidney disease, dementia and mortality. In a new review article scientists summarize the current evidence regarding the epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis and management of AF.

Current treatments can slow muscle damage, but don't address the root problem.

## Influenza virus genome: Finally discovered in its coat

To fight the virus that causes influenza, one of the avenues being explored by scientists is the development of drugs capable of destabilizing its genome, made up of RNA molecules. But the challenge is daunting: each RNA molecule is tightly bound to an assembly of proteins which creates a double helix, forming a protective coat that is difficult to manipulate.

But blocking the protein restores vaccine efficacy in an animal model.

Researchers have gained new insights into the molecular changes leading to Rett syndrome, a severe neurological disorder caused by mutations in the MeCP2 gene encoding methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2). The team reports that loss of MeCP2 in adulthood causes immediate progressive dysregulation of hundreds of genes -- some are activated while others are suppressed -- and these changes occur well before any measurable deficiencies in neurological function.

## Butchered bones suggest violent 'othering' of enemies in Bronze Age Britain

Analysis of the remains of at least 37 individuals from Early Bronze Age England finds they were killed, butchered, and probably consumed before being thrown down a 15m-deep shaft. It is the largest-scale example of interpersonal violence from British prehistory. The treatment of the remains was likely a means to dehumanize or 'other' the victims. This massacre was probably revenge for a perceived offense, implying a cycle of violence and questioning the idea that Early Bronze Age Britain was relatively peaceful.
