<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Heard about this movie on a podcast the other day and decided to give it a shot even though I&#39;d never heard a peep about it before and it was apparently an HBO Max original, but damn I loved it! </p> <p>Neil Patrick Harris plays the father of a young girl and he narrates a flashback story about him as a kid hoping to get an NES for Christmas in the 80s and doing everything he could to get his hands on it. The movie has great humor, rarely is a joke just a flat out dud, I laughed out loud several times (which takes a lot) the story is heartwarming, everyone including a bunch of child actors does a great job. For me, this will be a new Christmas classic I&#39;ll probably watch every year. I related to a ton of it and it&#39;s got so many quick subtle jokes that I&#39;ll probably find something new to laugh at every time. </p> <p>I highly recommend this if you want a new Christmas movie that doesn&#39;t suck. I think even kids would enjoy it. Get yo

In fact, I watched 505 as I also viewed a few bonus movies.</p> <p>I built the list from Best Picture winners from the big award shows. (Academy Awards, BAFTA, Screen Actors Guild, etc.) I also used every “Top 100” list I could find, and even used a helpful post here on Reddit that compiled the top 250 based on users scores, which helped find foreign movies.</p> <p>I made a rule for myself that I had to finish every movie, even if I hated it. (Which gave me the chance to change my mind on a few, like “Holy Motors,” etc.)</p> <p>So, here’s my Top 5 from each decade, except the 20s which only got 4, and the 2000s, which had too many great movies and gets 11. The movies are only listed

## Catherine O'Hara is simply spectacular as Kevin's mom in the Home Alone movies. She made the most out of a thin role, giving it more humor and depht than it deserved.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>If you go through the Home Alone movies, the bond between Kevin and his mom is the heart of the Film. They have a love-hate relationship in which Kate (O&#39;Hara) always sees the bad in Kevin (Macaulay Culkin), because he&#39;s a kid who allows his emotions to get the best of him when he&#39;s bullied by Buzz or cursed at by his no good Uncle, but she also has a lot of love for him. But when Kevin is lost or left by the wayside, it&#39;s the mom who bears the guilt and tries to figure out what went wrong as well as acknowledging her mistakes. </p> <p>One thing I felt lacked in Lost in New York was the mom&#39;s subplot. I loved the Catherine O&#39;Hara and John Candy&#39;s scenes in the first movie, great chemistry and O&#39;Hara&#39;s character got to do a self-examination. </p> <p>The sequel, O&#39;Hara is given less to do but the crux of the film continues to be the bond between Kevin and his mom. It&#39;s no accident that she&#39;s always the on

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Did Neil Breen have an influence on the script for Megalopolis, direct or indirect?</p> <p>To clarify what I mean, I highlight a number of similarities between Breens work and Megalopolis: - In Breens movies, every attractive woman wants to sleep with Breen, resulting in a romantic subplot or love triangle. In Megalopolis, Wow, Julia, and Vesta all sleep and/or want to sleep with Ceasar. - In Double Down, Niel Breen has constant flashbacks to his dead girlfriend. In Megalopolis, there are four random flashbacks to Caesar&#39;s dead wife. - In Breens movies, there are many disjoint plots taking place simultaneously. In Megalopolis, there is the plot between Caesar and Cicero amd the bank takeover plot with Wow and Shia Labeouf to name two. - In Breens movies, Breen is always endowed with supernatural power. One of the biggest selling points of Megalopolis is that Caesar has the power to stop time among others. - In Breens movies, the villains/antagoni

Looking at his filmography, he was productive from 1961-1975, but after that he became more inconsistent with his projects, pretty much taking years before he does one.</p> <p>From what I read, Beatty was a bit of a perfectionist and to the detriment of the crew, who takes his time and was go multitude of takes.</p> <p>I will say, I think Bonnie &amp; Clyde, Reds, &amp; Bulworth are masterpieces, and Dick Tracy is fun. However, he is also notable for some real stinkers, Ishtar is middling but it really tanked his image. Town &amp; Country is bad and it pretty much put him into exile and Rules Don&#39;t Apply, his comeback, reaffirmed that exile.</p> <p>O

The way she gives the one twin certain mannerisms, to distinguish the two apart is so cool. Not a single time during my viewing was I confused at which “twin” was on my screen. The fact that it was her first movie is insane to me. It was a performance way beyond her years. </p> <p>Every single line delivery of hers is incredible. Every single joke lands.</p> <p>There’s a certain scene about 20 mins into the movie, where the 2 girls discover that they’re twins. There’s a specific line that she delivers that absolutely broke my heart, and brought a tear to my eye. She delivers
