        "description": "When you look back at the Nintendo Switch and its original release in March 2017, it's incredible how far the console has come. While 2024 saw sales of the console nose-dive, especially after news of the Switch's successor being revealed by March 31st, 2025, it's ironic. \n\nThe console's momentum could only really slow down from the hype of Nintendo's next big thing. Regardless, the onslaught of quality releases for the Switch didn't stop. The year saw the arrival of hits like The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, Princess Peach: Showtime!, Super Mario Party Jamboree, and more. \n\nRemakes and ports of classics like Mario vs. Donkey Kong and Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon also made their way to the console. Let's go over 15 of the top Switch releases of 2024.",

        "description": "We don't know exactly how long we're going to be waiting for an Elden Ring 2, even if it does seem like an inevitability, but as far as the near future is concerned, fans of FromSoftware's open world epic have something rather unexpected to keep an eye on. \n\nA standalone multiplayer title set in the Elden Ring universe wasn't on anyone's card, so suffice to say, Elden Ring: Nightreign's announcement at The Game Awards came as a surprise to many. Due out next year, the game represents an intriguing experiment from FromSoftware, and for fans of the studio's works, an unusual proposition, as its first ever multiplayer-centric title, and one spinning off from an unexpected source on top of that. \n\nNonetheless, there's plenty that we've already learned about Elden Ring: Nightreign so far, even if the coming weeks and months are likely to bring plenty more information, so join us as we go over the key early details you should know about the game.",

        "description": "As games increase in complexity and visual fidelity, one has to question whether they can evolve in scale without running into all kinds of technical issues. However, if the past decade or so has proven anything, the open-world genre can thrive under several constraints and offer some of the most memorable experiences in gaming.\n\nEven as we focus on the 30 best open-world games ever made (as of 2024), there's truly something for everyone. The narratively minded will love Ghost of Tsushima, Red Dead Redemption 2, Horizon Forbidden West, and Death Stranding. Those who favor emergent gameplay have Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain, Dragon's Dogma 2, and Sea of Thieves.\n\nThen you have titles that reward creativity, like The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, Satisfactory, and The Forest. Let's look at all the other incredible open-world titles available and what makes them so great.",
