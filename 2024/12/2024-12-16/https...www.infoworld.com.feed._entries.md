<p>Well, that didn’t last long. <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3689973/what-is-generative-ai-artificial-intelligence-that-creates.html">Generative AI</a> has existed just a few short years, but already we seem to be alternating between bouts of disillusionment and euphoria. More worrying, however, is not where we are on <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/articles/hype-cycle-for-artificial-intelligence">Gartner’s Hype Cycle</a>, but how genAI has already been weaponized, sometimes by accident and sometimes quite intentionally. It’s normal for new technologies to overlook security as they rise to prominence, but for genAI, security shortcomings may erode the trust the technology needs f

<p>WebAssembly, or <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2255892/what-is-webassembly-the-next-generation-web-platform-explained.html">Wasm</a>, is an open standard that defines a portable binary-code format and corresponding text format for executable programs. Created and maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), Wasm is designed to facilitate high-performance applications on web pages. It supports multiple languages, is compact and fast, is supported by every major browser, and is generally safe and secure.</p>
