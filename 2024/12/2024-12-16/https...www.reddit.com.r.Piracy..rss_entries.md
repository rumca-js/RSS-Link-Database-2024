But what about streaming and visiting those websites? I&#39;m wanting to watch smiling friends but I don&#39;t currently subscribe to anything that has it. However this site has it for free <a href="https://www.smilingfriendsseason2.com/smiling-friends-season-2-watch">https://www.smilingfriendsseason2.com/smiling-friends-season-2-watch</a> (I checked it on virus total it&#39;s safe) it streams the episodes, so is it like torrenting or downloading? Or neither? I also found multiple sites that host free mangas that run directly on browser no downloads needed. Also, is it piracy to watch smiling friends here?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been using VLC Media Player for most of my life, in conjunction with content downloaded from Torrents. Recently, I&#39;ve also started using streaming sites online for watching. The UI and UX of these websites is very modern, I love the glassy effects, smooth transitions, and overall care for the experience. However, sometimes I find that a show is difficult to find in high quality on these sites, and so I go back to good ol&#39; reliable torrents. They&#39;re good, but my issue is with the media player I use to play this content.</p> <p>VLC is old. VLC looks like it&#39;s old. It&#39;s reliable, no doubt. But I find myself craving a better experience of watching movies and TV than VLC. I wish there was something that combined the beautiful UI of these sites online with the content that I can only get from torrents downloaded locally.</p> <p>Is there anything like that? <strong>What apps/programs do people on this sub use to watch their torr

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Might not be the right place to ask, but I really need to know. I use AirVPN for the port forwarding features, they provide wireguard config files. The best part about this is that you can use any wireguard client you want, I just don&#39;t know what to use. I specifically want a kill switch and split tunneling. Currently I&#39;m using the official wireguard client which is nice, but doesn&#39;t have either feature.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/AdamDaBest1"> /u/AdamDaBest1 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1hfchki/do_any_of_yall_use_a_custom_wireguard_client/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1hfchki/do_any_of_yall_use_a_custom_wireguard_client/">[comments]</a></span>
