I\u2019ve tried a lot, including working with specialists and doing CBT-I (currently on my third round). Despite that, I find it really hard to calm my active mind at night when my brain just won\u2019t turn off.</p> <p>I\u2019m wondering if anyone here has had success using VR devices, like Meta Quest VR (or any other VR platform), for improving sleep. Have you tried meditation, relaxation, or sleep focused apps in VR? If so, did they help with winding down, sleep quality, or anything else?</p> <p>I\u2019d love to hear about your experiences, what apps you\u2019d recommend, or even what didn\u2019t work for you as these things can be expensive. Any advice is appreciated. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/DragonfruitBright932\"> /u/DragonfruitBright932 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://ww",

The issue is downstairs plugged in the TP link router I get about 2400 Mbps but upstairs in my bedroom I only get roughly 535 Mbps, </p> <p>So I want to still play in my bedroom but getting a stronger Mbps, I was thinking a long ethernet cable running upstairs plugged into my TP link 5400 then into laptop or possibly another extender.

I am probably going to invest in the Vive Ultimate Trackers to finally get full body tracking. I&#39;d say I do equal parts of PCVR and Stabdalone while using my headset alone. However, I&#39;d like to maybe stream and/or record PCVR gameplay. Sometimes while using the link (wired or wireless) on the Quest 3, it can still have battery life issues, disconnections from time to time. When playing by myself I&#39;m fine with tinkering a bit sometimes, especially as someone coming from a Pimax lmao. Though to guarantee my viewers a greater experience, I have recently been looking into buying a used Reverb G2 as some say it offers similar quality and everall experience. It&#39;d supposedly remove the disconnection issues I can sometimes experience with",
