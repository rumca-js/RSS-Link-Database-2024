<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>First book was about the leader of a big mercenary army, who gets hired to protect a monastery (I think it was a monastery) from monsters living in the nearby ancient forest. Later in the book it is revealed that the monastery cleared parts of the forest for new fields and that the army of the forest people simply tried to protect their forest. Pretty sure the mercenary group won at the end because the king and his army arrived.</p> <p>2nd book was about a neighbouring country (an old empire in decline) hiring the mercenaries for - I think - a civil war of some sort. Succession crisis if I remember correctly, next in line was a woman and parts of the empire didn&#39;t like that. Don&#39;t remember most of it.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi. I was watching a video on Space Westerns, with some examples being Cowboy Bebop, Trigun, Firefly, and similar properties. That video got me wondering, is there an equivalent to this genre in Fantasy? To clarify, I don&#39;t mean something like Weird West stories, where it&#39;s the wild West but with magical stuff. What I mean is, stories that take place in fantasy settings, that borrow tropes, themes, and motifs of the Western Genre. The only example I can think of off the top of my head is the Nomad of Nowhere. If I haven&#39;t explained myself well enough, I will happily try to make it more clear if needed.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Beyond beautful prose, enticing magic, and a well thought out world, something i&#39;ve found I love in books is when there is a struggle for power; not out of greed necessarily, but out of necessity (or at least a perceived necessity). Rin from The Poppy War is one of my favorite characters for this reason, does anyone have any books (preferably series, though not too long) to suggest that have the traits I mentioned?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>First off, I’m a hater and a contrarian. If one person tells me to try something, I’m intrigued. If two people tell me, it’s added to my TBR. Three or more people and my suddenly hackles raise, I grow skeptical of anyone and everyone, and I’m ready to write up a 1-star review of the thing. But that’s between me and my therapist. All of this to say I went into Dungeon Crawler Carl (DCC) skeptical, thinking it was probably overhyped.</p> <p>Nope!</p> <p>I don’t really know how to best pitch this series. What works for me best is how it feels almost like an update on the Hunger Games - a deadly game competition that also manages to poke fun at the ridiculously callous nature of modern media. For DCC, this starts to go more towards the reality TV side of things, using some of the behind-the-scenes natures of such show as part of the commentary and plot.</p> <p>It also takes aspects from RPGs like Dungeons and Dragons or MMOs like World of Warcraft and us

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Just finished book 4. Really enjoyed reading the books, but now that they&#39;re wrapped there were there were major plot points that made no logical sense to me. Can someone help explain?</p> <p>1) What was Meical&#39;s plan? He said to distract Asroth, but for what purpose? In the end, the Ben-Elim went through the cauldron along with the Kadoshim. Were they trying to kill the Kadoshim permanently in the real world since they were made flesh? If so why did they need a distraction? Asroth would know the Ben-Elim could follow him anyway, so it should have been no surprise they came. </p> <p>2) What was the point of destroying the cauldron and other treasures? At that point both Ben-Elim and Kadoshim were already through to the real world. If they died their souls were gone for good, not sent back like the possessed Jehar. Destroying the cauldron served no purpose other than encasing Asroth which I&#39;m assuming is teeing up the sequels. </p> <p>3) W

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>The _The Guild Codex: Spellbound_ series comprises 8 main books with a couple of prequels and another couple of spin-off series. </p> <p>We follow Tori Dawson, a 20-ish yr old red-head Vancouverite (*) who, after being fired from yet-another job due to bad temper, finds herself filling a position as bartender in a pub. </p> <p>Of course, the pub is but the entrance of a magic guild. Of course, all young mages are hot and single (and rich? Yes, what did you expect?). Of course, bad guys have a bounty on their heads and the hot mages go after them -- with Tori following close. Of course, Tori has no powers and still manages to be at the centre of the action, getting involved with mages, fae, evil witches, druids, more than a few demons, and the occasional dragon. </p> <p>My assessment should not surprise you:</p> <ul> <li>&quot;New adult&quot; Urban Fantasy</li> <li>Fun to read (I did laugh out loud on a few occasions), easy to read, quick to read</li>

## If I liked The Bloodsworn Trilogy, is The Faithful and the Fallen a good next series?

Just wanna hear peoples&#39; thoughts before I spend time on it, though. Is it similar? Better? Worse? I really enjoyed his pacing in the Bloodsworn books and the way pretty much anyone could die. There wasn&#39;t a lot of plot armor.</p> <p>And on that note, if not The Faithful and the Fallen, any other recs if I like the Bloodsworn series? Again, fantasy books with no plot armor (Game of Thrones!) really get me going, haha.

It took me a bit to get into the story initially, but once I did, I was hooked. The setting shifts, the sense of mystery, the tension—it all really pulled me in. I was so invested in figuring out what was going on and where this was all leading. What was inside the Edifice ? I really hoped it would hold up to my expectations, something unpredictable and fantastic.</p> <p>Then came <em>that bloody sentence.</em> &quot;An Alien intelligence-gathering machine is sucking their brains a little at a time&quot;. </p> <p>And honestly? I’m so disappointed. It felt like it undermined everything that made the story so compelling up until that point.

Book 2 definitely delivered but it’s not TTC level and I didn’t expect it to be. </p> <p>In DoC we follow our two main characters from the first book but also a new character, Malo, an augmented warden who’s got enhanced senses of smell, vision and a very muscular right arm (clean your mind). A man has being murdered, only discovered because the flesh eating turtles already had their fill on other corpses, floating out the empire satellite state of yarrow. Upon investigating this murder, our detective trio discover a body overcome with mutation, growing a tree from the stomach, fish bones from the back and facial overgrowths. It appears they’ve rapidly undergone massive mutation but nothing we know of in the empire can do t

She downplays her own trauma, and treats Simon like a child far more than she should.</p> <p>For Simon, he overreacts big-time, but to be fair, I kind of understand.
