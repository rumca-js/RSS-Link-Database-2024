<p>From Software launched <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/elden-ring-review-death-of-the-wild/1900-6417832/">Elden Ring</a> in February 2022, and the game quickly caught on among players.

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/alan-wake-ii/">Alan Wake 2</a> has been one of a handful of games that hasn't gotten off to the best start on Sony's new PlayStation 5 Pro. Image quality issues, persistent performance wobbles, and challenges with the console's exclusive AI-upscaling technology, PSSR have all been noted. A <a href="https://www.alanwake.com/story/alan-wake-2-update-notes/">new update for the survival-horror game</a> aims to fix most of these issues, some of which boil down to disabling PSSR entirely.</p><p>Alan Wake 2 is the first game to allow players to toggle PSSR on or off, with the game falling back to its previous implementation of AMD's FSR upscaling when disabled. In most instances, PSSR has been an improvement over FSR (which uses linear scaling as opposed to AI-enchanced upscaling), but Alan Wake 2 has been an outlier.
