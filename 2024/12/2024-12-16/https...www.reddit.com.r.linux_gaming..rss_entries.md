<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I came across this post when looking for VSR alternative on Linux. Which essentially says that the lack if proper filtering makes it a waste of resources to use. My question is if there is any benefit of increasing the internal resolution and then apply FSR/DLSS/XeSS on the image?</p> <p>Or do I completely miss the mark in my understanding of this technology? The scaling factor of Ultra Quality for XeSS is 1.3. So upscaling from 4K internal resolution with a 1440p monitor would give you a (2160/1.3) base resolution before upscaling to 4k and then downscale again to 1440p. Wouldn&#39;t XeSS act as a kind of filter and make the image quality better?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Smygert"> /u/Smygert </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/s/bixDgAFb0z">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1hfvpco/super_sampling_on_linux/">[c

It&#39;s worked flawlessly, I even was on last night for ~3 hours. This morning I got up to hop on and I was running at 8fps. I thought it would be a GPU drivers problem (I use an Radeon 7700 XT) and it took me a whole new Ubuntu installation and 3 hours to eventually get it to (I think?) fix that issue. Now though, it gives me this error when trying to launch from the launcher downloaded from steam from the official website. I honestly am completely out of ideas and just wanna play this amazing game again, help would be appreciated</p> <

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Recently I got myself a second-hand GTX 1080Ti FE, and believe it is underperforming. In the heavier games I&#39;ve tested, Dead Space Remake and Space Marine II in particular, are performing absolutely awful, unable to hit 60fps (even struggling to maintain stable 30 in SM2&#39;s case) at native 1080p low in both games. FSR, DRS, dropping the resolution - nothing manages to help the card break 60. Upping the resolution to 1440p doesn&#39;t drop performance much either. CPU temps are around 60C and GPU is around 84C while in-game. Could this all be due to DX12 limitations on the 10 series? A Linux problem? I&#39;m stumped right now and would really appreciate some help. I&#39;ve tried several different proton versions, several system updates, using X11, using Hyprland, using nouveau drivers instead of proprietary and running with gamescope.</p> <p>Specs: Fedora 41, KDE Plasma 6.2.4 on Wayland, Mainline Kernel 6.12.4, Ryzen 5 7600, 1080Ti FE, 32GB 640
