All I want is something that will allow me to make a survey form with conditional routes, file upload and the ability to resume the form if not completed and the ability to have accounts for my boss and a few coworkers. Is there maybe a better solution for this that I have not found. Self hosted is greatly preferred but we have a short form that we pay way too much to jotform for it makes no sense.

For this topic I want to ask if I had a 2TB SSD or HD (doesn&#39;t matter), and I backed my data specifically right now I am using restic which essentially creates snapshots of your data. </p> <p>In any case the reason I had to mention that because if I was not using snapshots then I think it would not matter about my next question.</p> <p>Lets say I fully take up 2TB (currently only at 50gb) but need to think about this. But lets say I take all 2TB some day what would I realistically have to do? Do I then have to buy lets say a 4TB HD and drag and drop everything over to the 2TB storage? </p> <p>My idea would be simply to upload it to the cloud in the mean time and then buy a bigger drive &gt; redownload it back to my drive (4TB) in this case. </p> <p>Please let me know some suggestion...</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Swiss_Meats\"> /u/Swiss_Meats </a> <br/>",
