<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I forgot the name of one game, I played it a long time ago and don’t remember the plot, but I remembered some details. The game seems to be made in a pixel style, where two men torture you and your friend to find out some information. You have a choice either to tell or endure torture .You need to hold out for a certain number of days. Every day the torture becomes more severe, at first they just beat you, then they come with a torch, etc.One day, another friend of ours appears who is hiding, and every subsequent day, at your choice, he gives either medicine or painkillers to relieve your suffering.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So, Sorry is a very popular game, but it does have one aspect I&#39;ve always found annoying: At the start and end of the game, players will often draw multiple cards in a row that are useless to them.</p> <p>I thought of a way this could be improved: Instead of just drawing one card each turn, players are each dealt a hand of 5 or so cards which they can choose from on their turn, drawing one to end it. The 2 card simply allows a second card to be played.</p> <p>If a player has only one card with valid moves, it must be played. If a player has no playable cards, then they draw one, playing it if it can be played. Otherwise, they discard one card of their choice.</p> <p>On the subject, I hate the exclusion of 6s and 9s, I think they should just add a card that lets you move either 6 or 9.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/TurtleKing0505"> /u/TurtleKing0505 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.redd

We&#39;ve started doing Ticket to Ride as well as Azul, and she&#39;ll be getting Survive the Island (the newer version of Escape from Atlantis) as a Christmas gift.</p> <p>Given the recent popularity of board games, I&#39;m realizing that she&#39;ll get quite a different board gaming experience than I did growing up, when games were limited to Sorry, Monopoly, Clue, etc. I&#39;m thinking I might still want to introduce my kids to some more of those types of games, but am also quite happy to get them with the games in my collection that offer a lot more in the way of strategy.</p> <p>Have you been sticking to the classics with your kids, doing more new options, or trying a mix of both?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->

Over the years we have bought Dominion (big favourite) and basically all the expansions, Ticket to Ride, Sherlock Holmes (plus extra sets later), Harry Potter Battle(?) plus expansions. They play Yu-gi-oh duel a lot (have all the sets) we also have quick games like code names, Dobble and classics like Monopoly and Scrabble which they never really liked which only get used occasionally. When they were little &quot;Frog Juice&quot; was the absolute favourite and it still gets brought out sometimes for nostalgia.</p> <p>I don&#39;t have much money this year so can&#39;t afford a really expensive game but was wondering if something cheap like Trash Pandas would be good for adults, or do you think spending a bit more on something like Splendor would be better? I also looked at Exit - Death on the Orient Express ( but no replay value?) and love the look o

My first introduction to this style of game was through Dr Who Battles in Time about 20 years ago. But I can&#39;t remember it well. In that version, according to something I found online, players would have a set of 5 cards they could look at in their hand at all times — they could choose which to attack with / which to defend with. Also, once a player lost a round, his/her card was put to one side, removed from the game.</p> <p>These mechanics are different to the standard Top Trumps rules I see everywhere, which state that players can only use the top card in their pile, and the winner of a round takes both their card AND the opponents losing card and puts it at the bottom of their pile.</p> <p>Do BOTH sets of rules check out from a mechanics perspective?
