<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone. I m a back-end developer currently working with .Net for a company in Brazil. I did not go to college (keep in mind that I am 19), but I have a technician degree in IT and have been working as a developer for almost 2 years (I also have experience as a full stack dev). After some time working my interest in working for a company abroad grew, due to the fact that my English is somewhat advanced (for latam standards). I have applied for some positions through LinkedIn but haven&#39;t heard back from any of them, so I wandered if people that work for such companies or work in english speaking environments would have any advice for me. Thank you.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/motograchado"> /u/motograchado </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1hfomd5/how_can_i_find_remote_jobs_as_a_backend_developer/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.r
