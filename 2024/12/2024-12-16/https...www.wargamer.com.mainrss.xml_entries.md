								<p>For sci-fi tabletop wargame fans, it often feels like it's <strong>Warhammer 40k</strong>'s world, and we're just living in it - but original, non-grimdark miniature game concepts can come from the weirdest of places. Case in point: <strong>The Block War</strong>, a new wargame and 3D printable model range by two independent creators, based on a future conflict between high-tech armies of... spheres and blocks.</p>

However, thanks to a fan-made <b>Dungeons and Dragons</b> homebrew, I’m considering letting my D&amp;D character have at her with a sword.</p>
