<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>First, anyone who knows anything about American politics understands that because of the 2010 Supreme Court decision in Citizens United v. FEC, billionaires almost completely control the U.S. government.</p> <p>The way they do this is by anonymously donating to super PACs who then funnel their money to the campaigns of the politicians they wish to control.</p> <p>If anyone doubts that this money owns our politicians, ask any AI how much time the average House or Senate member spends on the phone each day calling rich people to solicit campaign contributions.</p> <p>Let&#39;s start with the motive some (but obviously not all) billionaires have to slow down AI progress. Billionaires became billionaires by being very smart about how they invest. Their very legitimate fear is that although few people can match their financial acumen, it won&#39;t be long until AIs specifically trained in investment will be easily out-maneuvering them in virtually every w

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’m reading Kurt Vonnegut’s Sirens of Titan and stumbled upon this quote that honest to goodness seems about as close to how AI works as you could possibly describe it in 1959:</p> <p>“It’s like a cloud that everybody has given a little puff of mist to, and then the cloud does all the heavy thinking for everybody. I don’t mean there’s really a cloud. I just mean it’s something like that. If you don’t understand what I’m talking about, Skip, there’s no sense in trying to explain it to you.”</p> <p>Does this seem absolutely uncanny to anyone else?

## Why AI Transcription is so bad

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Progress in AI Transcription seems to have stagnated over the last couple of years. On its surface AI Transcription seems relatively simple: (1) Transcribe the audio or video (2) assign the speakers. However, assignment of speakers requires a few discrete tasks. First is speaker diarization (e.g. what unique voice said what) which actually requires quite a bit of pre-processing to even perform. And second is speaker identification (e.g. what is the name of the person who is speaking). While improvements continue to be made to speech-to-text models, it seems like very little progress is being made in the speaker diarization and speaker identification space. Its worth noting that speaker identification, in particular, is driven primarily by context. Human transcriptionists are able to do this with relative ease, but speech-to-text and diarization models are not trained for these tasks.</p> <p>So how do we solve these problems? Well, I spend a lot of ti

I&#39;ve been diving deep into the world of AI, not just with language models like Gemini Advanced, GPT, and Claude, but also by exploring things like using AI to program quantum computers (still early days, but fascinating!) and even generate Doom maps. I will details this work on a seperate post... But one of my latest projects is a bit different: an AI-powered podcast called &quot;Transhuman Radio.&quot; </p> <p>It&#39;s a fictional cyberpunk talk show where I use AI to create a transhuman host (Z9TRON8) and guests who discuss mind-blowing topics like: * Solving the Navier-Stokes equations (S2.E1) * The Biotech Singularity and genetic engineering (S2.E2) * The ethics of mind uploading (coming soon!). Think of it as a blend of science, philosophy, and futuristic storytelling, all brought to life by AI - where I make the best AI&#39;s to have a discussion with eachother in this set
