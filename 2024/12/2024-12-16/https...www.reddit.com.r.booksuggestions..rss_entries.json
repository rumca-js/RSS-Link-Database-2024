I&#39;ve been wanting to read &quot;American Psycho&quot; as I found the movie really interesting. I don&#39;t necessarily know if I have a favorite genre, I just love books that I can become fully invested in and unable to put down. I&#39;d like to knock some &quot;Classics&quot; (Newer or old) off of my reading list, so I&#39;m open to older suggestions for sure. I&#39;m not too interested in anything overly romantic, or anything too too sad. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/loveurmotherr",

I read Harry Potter at 8, Animal Farm at 12, was obsessed with Percy Jackson for a bit. Ive always loved reading, especially fiction, but I could never properly focus on non fiction because I found it boring- even on topics that really intrested me. Anyway, lately, in the past few years, I feel like I havent been reading as much because of school and social media but I feel like in the last couple of months Ive really gotten back into reading. Like before, I would read maybe 2 books per month. Lately, for example over the autumn break, I finished 15. I just truly love book and Im really happy im getting back into reading. Im currently reading Vallet of the dolls, almost done, but Im looking for some book recs, ideally fiction. I do love philosophy and classics, b",

Maybe it&#39;s because I work in a writing job that&#39;s more technical and punchy than creative writing, but it drives me up the wall!</p> <p>I make exceptions for flowery writing when its good world building or really well done. I quite enjoy Tolkien for example.</p> <p>In recent years I&#39;ve torn through Asimov books because I find his style punchy. Recently I&#39;ve also gotten through &quot;There is no anti-memetics division&quot; which again worked because it was quite to the point, although characters were pretty shallow. I also quite enjoyed Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night because with it&#39;s autistic POV character, the writing was very much clear and concise.</p> <p>Can anyo",

I am going to describe my perfect book and maybe that reminds you of something. </p> <p>steam punk / victorian era esthetics, a good mix of magic and science like how they do in Arcane the show. A hint of Eldridge horror in the background, also has fantastical elements (like creatures, or different types of humans), good world building that you get lost in. </p> <p>i know i am being optimistic here and the book i want probably doesn&#39;t exist but if you know of a book that has some of these elements mainly the mix of science and magic then id very grateful.</p> </div><!-- SC_",

It\u2019s always felt like a challenge for me\u2014slower than everyone else, never quite able to keep up or comprehend everything. But recently, I\u2019ve started giving audiobooks a chance, and I have to say, I\u2019m really enjoying them! I know some people might argue that audiobooks aren\u2019t \u201creading,\u201d but for me, they\u2019re a total game-changer, and I\u2019m counting them as reading\u2014no matter what anyone says! </p> <p>I just finished &quot;Verity&quot; by Colleen Hoover and absolutely loved it.

I saw so many reviews for those books claiming they\u2019d \u201cchange your brain chemistry,\u201d so I was really excited to dive in, but they ended up feeling predictable and didn\u2019t leave much of an impact. </p> <p>I know both of",
