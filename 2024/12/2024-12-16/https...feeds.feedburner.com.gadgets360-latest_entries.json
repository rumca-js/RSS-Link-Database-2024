These caverns, known for their smooth, swirling marble walls, reflect vibrant turquoise hues due to the glacial silt in the water. Originally limestone, the rock underwent metamorphosis under intense heat and pressure, resulting in the intricate patterns seen today. Accessible only by boat or kayak, the caves offer visitors a breathtaking view of nature's artistry, with light and water creating ever-changing visuals. The icy waters, though tropical in appearance, highlight the glacial origins of this unique wonder, making it a must-see destination for explorers seeking beauty shaped by millennia of erosion.",
