        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Have any of you that watch booktube noticed booktubers acting like this lately because I have and I wonder. why? Some of the booktubers that I&#39;ve been watching lately have been making these challenges for themselves where they have to read a certain amount of pages for the month and when they don&#39;t they get disappointed with themselves. </p> <p>Saying I&#39;m going to try again next month and I&#39;m going to beat it. Also they will make videos doing wrap ups talking about all the books they read the previous month and how sometimes they&#39;re disappointed with themselves because they haven&#39;t read as many as the month before that or as many as they normally do. </p> <p>These same people also get disappointed with themselves when their yearly goal isn&#39;t the same or more as the previous one. Meaning they haven&#39;t read as many as last year or more than last year. So I&#39;m genuinely curious why they&#39;re doing this to themselves? ",
