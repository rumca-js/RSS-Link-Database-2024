The plan is to scrape data from event calendars (like dates, times, locations) and then use some kind of existing tools or services to estimate visitor numbers. Im based in Austria and specifically looking at Austrian events if that&#39;s releveant</p> <p>So far, I&#39;ve looked into services like PredictHQ and <a href=\"http://Placer.ai\">Placer.ai</a> which seem to offer some tools where i can just plug in event data and (hopefully) get an estimated visitor count returned. </p> <p>Here are some questions I have:</p> <ol> <li>What are your thoughts on how to best scrape event data? Websites like Fb, Eventbrite but also regional/local websites will be relevant</li> <",
