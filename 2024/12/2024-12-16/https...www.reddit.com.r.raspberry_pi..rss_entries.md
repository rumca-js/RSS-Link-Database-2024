<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Initially it was a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/klippers/comments/1hezz1a/skr_mini_didnt_appear_on_usb_device_list/">post</a> on another subreddit (if you want to see details of my first steps).</p> <p>In short words, I changed my RPi in 3d printer from RPi3 to RPi4 (and SD-card with operation system as well), and found companion board (SKR mini, based on STM32F103) stops responding.</p> <p>First decision was - something wrong with board. But connecting it back to RPi3 (with the new SD-card) shows it works fine.</p> <p>Board is externally powered, so power issue also excluded.<br/> Connect/disconnect of board generates no info in dmesg, the same as pressing reset button.</p> <p>And I have no idea how to check with usbhubctl, because board always powered and I see no indication about USB power.</p> <p>Adding &#39;max_usb_current=1&#39; to config.txt also shows no results.</p> <p>Is there any way to change RPi4 USB behavior similar to RPi3?</p> </

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello! I am doing a small console/pc project and this is my first time using a raspberry pi. I decided to purchase the pi zero and a touchscreen, and then a battery and some other stuff to make it portable.</p> <p>Everything was going fine, but when I plugged the screen I just saw a white light. If I connect it to a monitor i do see video. So I watched a tutorial on youtube that explained that you need drivers for it to work, I tried installing them but it didn&#39;t work, the screen just flashed and did weird things but didn&#39;t work, it still showed white light.</p> <p>I have tried installing raspberry os from the official website, from the screen company, retropie, and some other stuff but it always gives white screen, no tutorial or forum helps me, it&#39;s always white.</p> <p>If you need more info I got the screen on aliexpresss, it&#39;s a 2,4 inch 320 x 240 pixels screen. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://w

I want to create something a little different—something fresh and valuable that stands out. </p> <p>The goal is to offer <strong>onsite workshops</strong> that not only teach STEM skills but also help kids build a sense of community. The workshops will be tailored to three age groups: <strong>9-10 years</strong>, <strong>11-12 years</strong>, and <strong>13-14 years</strong>.</p> <p>Here are my initial ideas:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Python Programming Course:</strong> Using a DIY IoT home model kit (designed by me) with a Raspberry Pi. The kit would include features like programmable LEDs, an electromagnet for holding doors, a numeric keypad, a microphone (for a basic voice assistant), and possibly a servo motor. The course
