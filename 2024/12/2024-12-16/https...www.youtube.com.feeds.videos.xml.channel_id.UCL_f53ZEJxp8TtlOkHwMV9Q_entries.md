Dr. Jordan B. Peterson sits down with researcher and Rutgers University Professor of Psychology Lee Jessim. They discuss the denial of Left-wing authoritarianism across academia, how Leeâ€™s research proved such authoritarianism exists, the backlash and attempted cancellations he received for his work, and how he not only survived the battle, but also garnered a promotion as a result. 

This episode was filmed on December 7th, 2024.
