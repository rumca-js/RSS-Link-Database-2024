I had downloaded the DLC in the easy way, i.e. getting the zipped files from Qiwi and then dragging the extracted folder in the Sims&#39; one.</p> <p>Things I tried to solve the issue: - removing those folders and repeating the procedure (I still had the zipped files in my downloads) - following Anadius&#39; &quot;other problems&quot; instructions, dragged the Sims folder in my desktop and started the game - now I lost all my saves but still the problem persists.</p> <p>Does anyone have a solution/suggestion?

Problem number 1 is that it is now telling me to insert a D3 code but it was fine yesterday so i dont know what should i do with it. I did go to the games folder and found a file named doomkey and just in case i copied it, and when it showed to insert the doom key, i look in the doom key file again and it was not there, so i put it in but it is still showing the same. what should i do? i tried to put it in the game first like it showed me to but it didnt worked, then i tried to put it in the doom key file</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Heavy-Cheesecake5200\"> /u/Heavy-Cheesecake5200 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CrackSupport/comments/1hflwc4/can_someone_help/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www",
