They found 2 images that appear to be the same person. </p> <p>Since Pimeyes charges about 20USD for the URL for each image found, I tried screenshotting the resulting images and reverse image searched those through several sites. No results.</p> <p>What&#39;s curious to me is how Pimeyes can apparently find images that no other site finds? I&#39;m sceptical because the reverse image searches didn&#39;t bring up anything, yet the 2 results from Pimeyes look legit.</p> <p>Any suggestions to move forward without paying for Pimeyes?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/supertexter\"> /u/supertexter </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1hofebu/facial_recognition_stuck_after_pimeyes_results/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.re",
