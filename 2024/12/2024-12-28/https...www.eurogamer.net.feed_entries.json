Other games undoubtedly had more affecting storylines and characters, but as someone who obviously loves video games a great deal, Sony's PS5 nostalgia-fest drilled right into whichever part of my brain processes joy. And let's be honest, that part has been used less and less in recent years.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/games-of-2024-astro-bot-made-the-best-play-for-nos",
