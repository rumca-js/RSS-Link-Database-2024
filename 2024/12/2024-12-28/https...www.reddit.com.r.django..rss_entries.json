One of the main projects I started working on (quite naively I must say in hindsight) was creating business management software for a company I was interning at. Some two years and a lot of itterations later, I decided to open-source the project under the name <strong>Bloomerp</strong>.</p> <p>The vision behind the project is to allow developers to build scalable business management software for companies <strong>by just defining the Django models</strong>, whilst maintaining the ability to add custom functionality that fits integrates within the project&#39;s UI.</p> <p>Some out-of-the-box features that Bloomerp provides:</p> <ul> <li>Intuitive CRUD views with built-in access control</li> <li>Advanced list views offering powerful filtering</li> <li>A PDF generation system for documents based on objects (like contracts, using Employee objects)</li> <li>Customizabl",
