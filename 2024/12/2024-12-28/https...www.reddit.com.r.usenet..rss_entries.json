What I initially thought would be a quick task ended up being far more time-consuming than expected.</p> <p>I reviewed nine different indexers where I hold memberships. The ease of gathering data varied significantly depending on each indexer&#39;s category search functions and API. The indexers I examined include both public and private ones, with at least one not listed among publicly discussed indexers. I intentionally avoided newer indexers formed within the last 2-3 years.</p> <p>As part of this exercise, I counted over 450 Million nzbs. I only examined the 2000, 3000, 5000, and 6000 categories for these indexers.</p> <p>I\u2019m not naming any indexers because I want to keep the focus on the data, rather than spark discussions about which indexer offers what. This is purely for informational purposes.</p> <h1>Age ",
