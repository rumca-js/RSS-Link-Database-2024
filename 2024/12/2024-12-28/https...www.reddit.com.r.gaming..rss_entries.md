<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Like most “grown ups”, I have a job, a family, other responsibilities and hobbies: I just don’t have time to play as many games as I wish I could these days.</p> <p>But I still love to play games, and I try to keep up with how gaming is evolving. As much as people like to presage doom about the industry, as someone who has played games for 30+ years, I’d say the gaming landscape is vibrant, exciting, and full of experiences that you just can’t have with any other medium.</p> <p>So for myself and everyone else who doesn’t have the same amount of time as they used to have: what are your recommendations for games that are absolutely “must-plays” - not so much games that are standards (like Half-Life, or Witcher 3, or Resi 4 or The Last of Us), but more games that are slightly off the beaten path: strange, unusual, absolutely unique experiences that everyone should add to their play list to try at least once?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I was watching a behind the scenes documentary on Cyberpunk 2077 and one of the developers said something that really stuck out. He said that all his mentors and predecessors could make 40-50 games in their lifetime. But modern games are so complex, he&#39;ll be lucky if he works on 6. Having one or two flops out of 40 isn&#39;t a big deal. But one or two out of 6 ruins a resume.
