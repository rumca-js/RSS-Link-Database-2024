<p>As the scheming show returns for a third series, its appeal to millions worldwide suggests everyone has a wicked side</p><p>For the benefit of the uninitiated, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/16/love-island-review-the-traitors-australia-celebrity-save-our-sperm-heat"><em>The Traitors</em></a><em> </em>is a BBC One game show involving 22 players, classed as either Traitors or Faithfuls. Staged at a Scottish castle (Ardross Castle in the Highlands, north of Inverness), it features a group of selected Traitors who must “murder” the Faithful, while the Faithful identify and banish Traitors. If a Traitor evades detection and makes it to the end, they swipe the entire prize pot, totalling as much as £120k.</p><p>So, yes, it’s a gameshow, but, as those in thrall to the cloaked global entertainment franchise could tell you, it’s also so much more than that. It’s a dark and terrible dance of back-stabbing and scheming. It’s the pungent base notes of human nature.

<p>For more than 25 years, <a href="https://venturearts.org/artists/horace-lindezey/">Horace Lindezey</a> has been making art at Venture Arts, a Manchester-based studio working with learning disabled artists. In his ever-growing collection of ceramic blue plaques, created with the assistance of ceramicist <a href="https://www.claystudio.co.uk/about">Caroline Tattersall</a>, he celebrates people who have meant something to him – family members, friends, TV personalities and musicians – focusing on life’s central milestones: births, marriages and deaths. “I feel happy with making the plaques,” says Lindezey. “I roll the clay on to the mould, paint it white, then I put the letters on it. I like showing them in exhibitions, in Blackburn and London. I like to see them out there – they are nice memories of some people that have died.”</p><ul><li>A limited edition book of <em>The Blue Plaques</em> (£25), signed by the artist, is available at <a href="http://venturearts.org/">venturearts.org

Saracens travelled west aiming to make it four wins from four in December, but were dismissed with contemptuous ease by Johann van Graan’s finely-tuned side.

Not the dark in and of itself, but what I was certain it contained: bad spirits, bad people, monsters with ill intent. The dark hid creatures with talons and teeth, or men with weapons who would use them to sneak up on an unsuspecting child and do them harm. The dark let curses slip out of buildings or hedges and attach to a child walking past. I kept myself bounded within the dome of torchlight on winter afternoons, thinking of light as a spell of protection. I went to bed by the orange glow of a nightlight, the hall light on and the door ajar.</p><p>I borrowed Jill Tomlinson’s book <em>The Owl Who Was Afraid of the Dark</em> from the library and fell in love with the baby barn owl, Plop.

Maybe it thought I was a threat on my bike</p><p>As I cycled up the narrow country lane, I&nbsp;stopped when I heard an almighty piercing call. I quickly spotted an extremely large bird perching among the bare branches of the tall trees that loomed above me. Luckily, I kept my eyes on the magnificent bird as it took flight, because despite the woodland winter nakedness, it was camouflaged so well in the bare branches that I&nbsp;wouldn’t have noticed where the&nbsp;shrieking was coming from.</p><p>I was amazed at how elegant it was to watch, despite its size, and I instantly recognised it as a red kite. I am fortunate to see these birds soaring over fields around here, with their acrobatic flight, graceful gliding and their enormous red wingspan, which can reach up to 195cm!</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/dec/28/young-country-diary-whats-that-piercing-cry-in-the-winter

<p>Complaining about BA is a ‘national sport’, but even critics says its £7bn turnaround plan is starting to bear fruit</p><p>It’s been a long and turbulent time since anyone used British Airways’ old slogan “the world’s favourite airline” with a straight face. After a decade during which the UK flag carrier was tarnished by cost-cutting, IT fiascos, mass redundancies and strikes, BA was then pushed to the brink by Covid.</p><p>Hopes of a smooth recovery disappeared like lost luggage on a carousel, as cancellations and delays plagued an airline seen as pricier than short-haul competitors and dowdier than the Gulf carriers. With burgeoning complaints about customer service, pledges by bosses to turn things round were met with some scepticism.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/dec/28/is-british-airways-getting-better-complaints-7bn-turnaround-plan">Continue reading...</a>

Both McCarthy and Trump rose to power as demagogues who fed on the American public’s fear of “enemies within”. My family had cause to fear on the biggest of these counts: my parents were communists from an early age, although they had quit the party in 1939 after Hitler’s pact with Stalin. In the heyday of US power, families such as mine were persecuted for a cause in which they no longer believed.

<p>John Harris and family revisit the first serious hill-walk they made in a landscape that’s more comforting than challenging – just what they’re looking for at this time of year</p><p>I moved to Somerset in 2009, from a home in Wales between Bannau Brycheiniog (the Brecon Beacons) and the Black Mountains. The change took me closer to London and rid me of painfully long train journeys, but I really missed the landscape – and, more specifically, walking around it. The little I knew about my new home county was mostly centred on two attractions: the Glastonbury festival and Cheddar Gorge – that deep topographical crack that draws thousands of tourists to caves, overpriced cheese and the kind of shops and cafes that make it feel like a&nbsp;mid-level English coastal resort, without any sea. It didn’t seem to offer much of a substitute.</p><p>What I didn’t know about was the other 70-odd square miles of the Mendip Hills, all craggy outcrops, dry-stone walls, waterfalls and dizzyingly be
