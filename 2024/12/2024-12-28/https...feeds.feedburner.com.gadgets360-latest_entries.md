Axial Seamount, an undersea volcano located off the coast of Oregon, is showing signs of an impending eruption, with scientists predicting it could occur as early as 2025. The volcano’s surface has been swelling, and seismic activity is increasing, both of which mirror patterns seen before previous eruptions. Researchers have been closely monitoring the volcano using a sophisticated network of sensors, providing real-time data to help refine eruption forecasts. The use of artificial intelligence to analyse seismic patterns from past eruptions offers new hope for more accurate predictions. While Axial Seamount’s eruption poses minimal direct risk to human populations, improved forecasting could help protect vulnerable coastal areas from potential tsunami threats.

Organic molecules, the building blocks of life, have been discovered across space—from interstellar clouds to asteroids and comets. Findings from missions like Rosetta, Hayabusa2, and Osiris-Rex reveal that these compounds existed long before the Sun formed. Scientists believe organic molecules survived planetary formation in protoplanetary disks and contribute to the chemistry of emerging worlds. This cosmic chemistry not only sheds light on life’s origins on Earth but also raises the possibility of life elsewhere in the universe

Space exploration in 2025 will see remarkable missions from global agencies like NASA, ESA, China, and Japan. Key initiatives include lunar landings through NASA’s CLPS and Japan’s M2/Resilience, which will test new technologies and study lunar resources. China’s Tianwen-2 mission aims to collect asteroid samples and explore a comet, advancing knowledge of the solar system. Deep-space flybys, including ESA’s JUICE and NASA’s Europa Clipper, will aid long-term planetary exploration. These missions, featuring asteroid studies, Moon research, and interplanetary journeys, promise to expand humanity’s scientific understanding while advancing the technologies essential for future exploration efforts.

ISRO’s Spadex mission, scheduled for December 30, will demonstrate satellite docking with two small spacecraft, SDX01 and SDX02, launched into orbit using PSLV-C60. The mission will highlight innovative technologies, such as precision sensors and orbit determination systems, and showcase power transfer between the docked satellites. Payloads on both satellites will remain operational for two years, contributing to vegetation monitoring, resource management, and space radiation analysis. This landmark mission is a critical step for future ISRO projects, including Chandrayaan-4 and the proposed Bharatiya Antariksh Station
