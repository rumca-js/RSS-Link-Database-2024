<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hai. I am building a chrome extension with react vite. Have some issues with it dealing with styles on the content script generation. If anyone experience building this plzz help.</p> <p>Started off with a boiler plate . Using tailwind. Trying to build a password manager kind of thing.

So that I need that content script</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/HungryFall6866"> /u/HungryFall6866 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1hoa7ht/help_buil
