If anyone experience building this plzz help.</p> <p>Started off with a boiler plate . Using tailwind. Trying to build a password manager kind of thing. So I need to write a content script to display a modal prompting the user to save the credentials. But the popup build inside the content script is not using tailwind styles.</p> <p>Also wish to know if a user presses a button for example the login button. Can we bring the extension popup prompting the user to store the credentials. As per my knowledge it&#39;s not possible. That why I plan to show a modal page in the web page .
