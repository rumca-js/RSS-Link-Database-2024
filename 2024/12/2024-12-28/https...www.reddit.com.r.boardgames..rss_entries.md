Troup gets 2 damage. Then through some bug&#39;s ability (or even in the next round by rearranging items), the troop loses the armour. What happens to the damage?

If the armour gets transfered to another troop, so does the damage</p> <p>2) Med bay returns a troop to life with 1HP. Question is... do they still have their ability? What if they&#39;ve already used it this round, does it &quot;recharge&quot;?</p> <p>3) Assault commander (and a division ability) lets you move a troop to the front of the lane and

I did some online research and i&#39;ve narrowed down the choices to Seaside, Adventures, Dark Ages, and Hinterlands. Dark ages is the largest, and has cool trashing mechanics, but I&#39;m not sure how well it works with cards from other expansions in the same game. Seaside and Adventures have lots of duration cards, and adventures has journey tokens and upgradeable cards. I don&#39;t know as much about Hinterlands, but the theme is interesting and the cards seem cool. Any advice? Thanks</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https:

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>A year ago I played The Game of Life for the first time and was disappointed, I know this criticism is stupid considering this is a kids game but I found it too unrealistic- some things were too hard (like, having a child), some things were too easy (finding a job/living), and didn&#39;t leave enough liberty. So I decided to take it and remake it</p> <p>And remake it did I!</p> <p>I finished it this summer and it was the funniest thing! I added multiple fields you can graduate from, so finding a job will be super hard! I added taxes, so not only do you need to have the money to buy a house, you also need a good job to make sure you can pay all the bills!! Now, you can&#39;t get married anymore out of nowhere, you first need to find yourself a partner, which is not hard, expecially if you take the raum &quot;download tinder&quot;; where you still might fail! But don&#39;t worry, you&#39;ll be able to find new partners during your life time, and potent

Just under half of these plays are from BGA or digital, almost exactly half of them were 2P with my wife.</p> <p>I typically play 2-player games, as I most often play with my wife and my collection of close to 200-ish games is geared towards euros that are great at 2P, with a handful of solo games and even less Dudes on a Map games.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>For Christmas we got Wizard Omnibus and have had an all out war on an ambiguous portion of the rules for Wizard Omnibus Camelot. Hoping someone else may have encountered this and has the solution. </p> <p>When an Excalibur is played, who leads the deal after? Is it who won the last deal? Is it the person who played the Excalibur? Is it the person to the left (whose deal would be next in the next round)?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Misdowluna"> /u/Misdowluna </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1hnutq6/wizard_omnibus_camelot_rules/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1hnutq6/wizard_omnibus_camelot_rules/">[comments]</a></span>
