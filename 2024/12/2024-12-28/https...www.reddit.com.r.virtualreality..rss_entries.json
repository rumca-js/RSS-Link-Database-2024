I thought that maybe the port was weird so I tried the cable in different spots but I got the same result, this made me think that I had bought a bad cord so then I tried the air link method but when that loaded in, the exact same problem with the grey glitching screen occurred. So with both of the widely used methods not working I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s just my pc or headset that\u2019s the problem. I tried updating my pc, updating drivers and changing graphic settings and the same problems still happen and was wondering if there\u2019s anything I can do at this point.</p> </div><!--",

I hooked my Quest 3 up to my PC and used Meta Quest Link to go onto my desktop and play the games through there, I&#39;ve been able to run simple games like Blood Trail and The Lab but they still seem to lag even slightly no matter what. Trying other, more powerful games like Half Life Alyx or Bootstrap island gives the same result, muddy graphics with slight lag spikes. I&#39;ve tried basically everything I can from getting a tp-link AV1000 and even trying out Steam link or tweaking settings but nothing changes the outcome. Does anyone know what could be wrong at all? Much thanks in advance.

The way I have set everything up is that my PC is connected to router with Ethernet cable (CAT6) and Quest 3 is connected to same home Wifi on 5G band.</p> <p>The network speed with speedtest is around 80mbps for download and 5-10mbps for upload</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/OptimalAttempt3\"> /u/OptimalAttempt3 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1hocc65/quest_3_with_pcvr_getting_weird_stutters_is_that/\">[link]</a><",

I\u2019m not just looking for gaming but also for productivity like having multiple screens to stay organized and the idea of sitting on top of a virtual mountain while being productive sounds awesome.</p> <p>One thing I\u2019m concerned about with the Quest 3S is the fresnel lenses versus the pancake lenses on the Quest 3. I don&#39;t know much about the difference, but from what I\u2019ve heard it seems like it could be a deal-breaker, especially for clarity and comfort. I also wear glasses, so that\u2019s another factor to consider maybe?</p> <p>For those with experience, is the Quest 3 worth saving up for the better lenses and overall performance or is the 3S still a good option for a first-timer?</p> <p>Would love to hear your thoughts.

I have a Quest Pro and currently run it with Index Base Stations &amp; Controllers + 4 Vive Trackers. I love to shuffle but currently live in a second floor apartment, and I just can&#39;t dance like that here. I had the goofy idea to rent a garage in front of my apartment and do some sort of wifi extension so I can use my Quest in the garage. Obviously, I can&#39;t use my lighthouse tracked equipment in there, so is there something I could use instead that would actually work decently at an extended range? I&#39;m willing to spend money to do this because I miss being able to dance freely, and moving into a house or another apartment is not an option at this time.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ohk-d\"> /u/ohk-d </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1ho4tc7/garage_dan",

The native psvr2 version, or the praydog pc mod ?</p> <p>I haven&#39;t buy any vr headset for now, and depending on the answer, I&#39;ll chose a path.</p> <p>I only played re7 on the psvr1 for info, that&#39;s it with my experience with VR so far. I tried my psvr1 headset on my pc using trinus and reshade, but I noticed that it was pretty clunky and limited. For example, I could only move my head in left-right-up-down directions, but there was no &quot;space tracking&quot; (I don&#39;t know how to call it) when I moved my head forwards or backwards, so it felt pretty superficial, unlike on my ps4 where I could move my head freely in the 3d space. Anyways, I was wondering, if I buy a pc vr headset and play RE8 praydog, will I have this same issue of no space tracking ?</p> <p>Thanks ! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitte",
