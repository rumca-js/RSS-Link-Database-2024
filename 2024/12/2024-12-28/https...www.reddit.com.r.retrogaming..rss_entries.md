<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi fellow retrogamers,</p> <p>I encountered a problem with my Commodore64 and AppleII when I try to connect either of them to one of these 14&quot; portable HDMI monitors you see pop up all over Amazon etc.<br/> That thing doesn´t understand the 4:3 aspect ratio.</p> <p>The setups I tried are like this:<br/> Apple II composite output -&gt; McBazel ODV -&gt; HDMI Monitor = no output<br/> C64 S-Video -&gt; McBazel ODV -&gt; HDMI Monitor = no output<br/> My (way too large) TV does work with the output of the ODV. That is more or less my standard setup with the ol&#39; reliable C64.</p> <p>Now the question: What do I need to convert the 4:3 (480p or 576p) output from the ODV (or the AppleII | C64) to 16:9 (720p or 1080p) the dumb monitor understands? The monitor itself works with let´s say a standard RaspberryPi at 1920x1080 or 1280x720, so it´s not broken. But if I set the resolution of the Pi to 640x480 the monitor just says &quot;no support&quot;.<br/

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>It&#39;s sad but at the same time I can&#39;t feel bad. Their prices post-covid were just simply astronomical for anything retro gaming related. They had a great selection of comic books, merchandise, some playable pinball machines, but their prices just got too greedy and it&#39;s not surprising to see them go. The fact that they stayed open this long in a dead shopping center (The Hamilton Mall), its a miracle they survived this long. I had many memories buying a lot of things there throughout the years but anything I saw there I could buy for much cheaper online. Goodbye Level Up, you were a great store but survived as long as you could due to greedy practices and in turn it&#39;s what also caused you to lose many customers.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey guys! I would like to start by apologizing because this is a game I probably played around 92-93, when I was 7-8 years old. I can’t recall much detail, other than there was a level (maybe several) where you would reach the end of a level and then have to track yourself back before the timer on a bomb ran out.</p> <p>It was space-based. I THINK I remember the character wearing a spacesuit, or at least a helmet. It’s not Metroid. </p> <p>I never owned it, but I either rented it or was leant it for a bit.</p> <p>I’ll think about the game from time to time and have both tried google and ChatGPT with no luck.</p> <p>Sorry for the lack of details but I figured if no one here knows then that’s that.</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/zorthex"> /u/zorthex </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1hnsuyn/help_me_find_the_name_of_an_nes_game/">[link]</a></span
