        "description": "Bathroom exhaust fan ventilation tips\u2026mold and mildew made the air quality bad in this bathroom. Healthy indoor air quality is important to everyone, especially those with small kids and pets. According to the EPA, poor indoor air quality can cause respiratory and heart issues. The solution is to remove the problem and properly ventilate the space. I used insulated ductwork and connected it to the Panasonic Whisper Cozy\u2019s adaptor using a clamp and foil tape. In addition, the fan should be ventilated outside and sealed to the drywall with silicone to maximize indoor air quality. Panasonic\u2019s Whisper Cozy is available at your local Home Depot store. Many thanks to @panasonic for sponsoring my client\u2019s project \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\udd25#bathroomexhaustfan #indoorairquality #panasonic #brandpartner",
