<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi together,</p> <p>I am still using an old Pixel 3a with DivestOS as kind of dumb phone - means I do not have any finance apps or password manager installed. Neither do I have stored any pictures nor sensitive data. I use it only for Signal, YouTube, Reddit and light web browsing. </p> <p>I also have a Pixel 7a, which is used for anything else, but mostly kept in the drawer. I just prefer using the 3a for some reason.</p> <p>I am really anxious about not receiving security updates even if I do not store sensitive data. Is keeping DivestOS for my use case safe? Or should I better switch to LineageOS, which still supports the 3a?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/DerGemeineAutist"> /u/DerGemeineAutist </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/degoogle/comments/1hobw0c/dumb_phone_use_case_keep_divestos/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/degoogle/comments/1hobw0

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>In the last couple of months I’ve been recieving emails from companies with someone else’s personal details such as bank statements, bond applications, business registrations etc with my exact email address but I know very well I didn’t sign up for these things. </p> <p>With further investigation, this person that I’ve been emails for has the same first name and last name (which is what I use for my gmail account), the only thing that’s different is their second name. For example my initials are FG and their initials are FS but our first and last names are exactly the same. </p> <p>I’ve emailed the companies back tell them they have the wrong email address but it doesn’t help. At this stage I’ve had this email address for YEARS, I can’t change it now, I use it for so many of my personal accounts. Is there a way I can block other people from using my email address? </p> <p>I don’t want to leave it then in future be linked to anything fraudulent. </p>
