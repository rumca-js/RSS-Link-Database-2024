Here's what to expect from Nintendo in 2025 and a look at the Nintendo 2025 games on the way next year. Soon it will be 2025, also known as the year Nintendo finally pulls back the curtain on its next console. After 2024 was filled with shaky rumors, alleged leaks, and nonstop speculation about the Nintendo Switch 2, we know for a fact Nintendo will share more about the next generation in less than 100 days. If that’s not exciting enough for you, the Nintendo Switch still has a few cards up its sleeve and 2025 will finally see the launch of Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, eight years after its initial announcement. And, as always, there will surely be some surprises along the way, with some possibly tied to Mario's 40th anniversary.

## Yellow Paint in Video Games Needs to Stop

Yellow paint in games isn’t a new complaint, but the last couple of years have seen it rise to prominence. Both yellow paint in Resident Evil 4 and FF7 Rebirth (Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth) stoked the online debate, with everyone from your average gamers to AAA developers getting involved. Because the trope of using lashings of yellow paint to guide players had been well and truly highlighted, I wrongly assumed that we’d likely seen the end of it. That was until I began playing A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead and Stalker 2 and they were covered in yellow muck telling me where to go.

Why is this still happening? How have we got here? I needed answers from someone who knew exactly why developers turn to games yellow paint time and time again. I got in touch with a lead UI Designer to help make sense of this yellow madness and hopefully provide an alternative solution to the glossy paint assault.
