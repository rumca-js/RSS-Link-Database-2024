Half read, half listened to, it\u2019s honestly a very cool take on the urban-fantasy-modern wizard genre. Also the audiobook rocks, so that helps. Very interesting mix of hard and soft magic systems, likable characters, and sarcastic British humor- made even better by the narrator (Kobna Holdbrook-Smith). Has the Dresden elements of police work and investigation but without the Dresden elements that are often complained about: \u201cmale gaze\u201d, repetitiveness, and Dresden generally being a whiny and \u201cchivalrous\u201d punk for half the book. There\u2019s well written romance, but that\u2019s not the main focus. IMO it\u2019s much less pulpy feeling than Dresden (don\u2019t get me wrong I love pulp, Conan is my favorite series ever), and is great as a fun read. </p> <p>Side note: I love Jim Butcher, and I\u2019ve tried to get into Dresden four or five times, but I ha",
