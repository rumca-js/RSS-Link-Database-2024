        "description": "For RPG fans, 2024 has been an incredible year, to put it mildly. Regardless of which style of RPG you prefer, these last dozen months have had plenty on offer for everyone, and the majority of it has been excellent. \n\nWhether 2025 will continue that trend remains to be seen, but even so, a handful of titles are officially confirmed for the year that suggest there's going to be no shortage of great RPGs to play in the near-future- and among that list of games, Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is also present.",
