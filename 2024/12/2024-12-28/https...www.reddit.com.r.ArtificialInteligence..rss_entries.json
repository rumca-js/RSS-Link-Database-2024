I have a simple LLM chat bot (Llama3.2) that i am trying to teach a data set, rules and information about a particular subject. I currently am using Open WebUI and have files in the workspace Knowledge section. The chat bot can converse quite well but can never seem to recall information i have included. It seems to be checking the files but even when I ask it questions about the data files it does not recall the info properly. I am curious as to whether this means i need to train the bot more about the information or perhaps the data is in the wrong format and the bot doesnt know what it is looking for or if I need to go another way to get it to use all this information. all of this is stored locally on my PC and is not accessing a cloud or the internet as far as I am aware.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/OkEstablishment6038\"> /u/OkEstablishment6038 </a> <br/> <span><a href",
