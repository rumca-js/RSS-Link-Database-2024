<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@KiunB">Kiun B’s YouTube videos</a> are mini documentaries about her life and the lives of the 800 people who live in her hometown of Yakutia, Siberia, aka the coldest town on Earth. The creator, who narrates the videos, says she and her community are native to the region. The enchanting mini docs showcase their customs, culture, and day-to-day life — which looks quite different when it’s 95 degrees Fahrenheit below zero outside.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Dreams on a Pillow</em> is a video game experience about the 1948 Nakba, an event where roughly 700,000 people were displaced from their land and homes due to Zionist occupation.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The game, described as “a pseudo-3D stealth adventure game about a land full of people being made into a people without land,” is from Palestinian developer Rasheed Abu-Eideh. But before I tell you more about that, let me tell you about his previous game.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We live in a landscape where words like “reboot” and “retcon” are common knowledge. Hollywood executives use the word “multiverse” in complete seriousness. No one can talk about “Batman in the movies” anymore — you have to specify. Nolan Batman? Snyder Batman? Reeves Batman? Bryan Singer’s Magneto, or the <em>First Class</em> one? Raimi Spider-Man or the Amazing run or the MCU version? Superhero movies don’t have to explain comics anymore. They can just <em>be</em> like comics — places for creative folks to drop in, do their take on a long-established character, and see what the audience thinks about it.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The end of the year is nearly upon us, and while that means all kinds of things, one thing that might get lost is how many streaming services are cleaning out their catalogs for 2025. Of course, there will be plenty of movies added to platforms like Netflix, Prime Video, and Criterion Channel next year, but for now, we’re focusing on the best movies leaving at the end of December. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This month’s selection of movies includes a perfect companion to one of the most surprising games of the year, a perfect companion to this Christmas’ Bob Dylan biopic, one of the best comedies of the 2010s, and a horror classic. </p>
