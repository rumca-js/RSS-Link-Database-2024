<p>Capcom released an absolute gem of a game this year. No, I'm not talking about Dragon's Dogma 2, Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster, or Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection--all of which hit shelves in 2024. And you didn't miss a stealth release in the Resident Evil, Street Fighter, or Monster Hunter series. Alongside three major well-received releases, Capcom released an off-beat game filled with ghosts, Japanese tradition, and strategic job assignment: Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess. This game was released in 2024, but it feels like it was sent forward from 2004--in all the best ways.</p><p>No one is going to blame you for having missed it. To say it flew under the radar is an understatement, and Capcom said in a recent financial briefing that the game did not meet sales targets. But Kunitsu-Gami should be treated as almost a historical document, both in the way the game is designed and in its actual content.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://ww
