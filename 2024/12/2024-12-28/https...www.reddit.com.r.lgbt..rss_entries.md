<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>She was a transgender teen who was ruthlessly abused by her Christian family after coming out, and forced her into brutal conversion therapy. They also tried to isolate her as much as possible, leading Leelah to write a suicide note online, and she was later found dead. Her parents falsely claimed to lover her and the aftermath and purposefully misgendered her.</p> <p>In her suicide note, she said she wanted her death to mean something. So, as a trans girl myself, I&#39;m writing a character in an original novel of mine that&#39;s a direct homage to her, in the form of a captain of a massive starship. I deeply resonate with her struggles, and I&#39;ve been experiencing similar abusive from my MAGA Christian family. We must keep fighting for our equality. Victory is the greatest tribute we can pay, for those who died under bigotry and oppression. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/B_Wing_83"> /u/B_W

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t believe that these types of virtual protests work in most cases, nor do I think we have the numbers to influence anything even if we <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=laT7xex-0dM">all grouped up and hit it till it dies.</a></p> <p>What I think makes this worthwhile is the interesting test to see what our speaking power actually is in the queer community. In case anyone needs a reminder about why this is important: First is trans kid erasure, then is trans erasure (already in progress), then it&#39;s queer erasure as a whole, and the whole of the media and entertainment industry will follow suit in regression if we don&#39;t start throwing up the defensive front. We have to at least try.</p> <p>At this time, throwing a ton of dislikes at the youtube ad isn&#39;t gonna do much because disney is filtering/silencing the anti-hate campaign. So we go for the throat instead: Rotten Tomatoes and IMDB when the series actually launches. If w

Unfortunately it&#39;s hard to avoid this time of year, especially after the election.</p> <p>She always says that she is supportive of the LGBTQ community. But I honestly think that her support only extends to those she personally likes.</p> <p>Today we were visiting family and she brought up how so-and-so is trans, that he&#39;s started wearing makeup and dresses but isn&#39;t going by a different name/pronouns. This caught me off guard but I was curious, since I&#39;m LGBTQ too. (I was zoning out so I didn&#39;t catch WHO she was talking about)</p> <p>I felt safe asking about it during the car ride home, since she had sounded supportive when she brought it up.
