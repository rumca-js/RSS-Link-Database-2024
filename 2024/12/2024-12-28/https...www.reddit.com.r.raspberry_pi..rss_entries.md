For almost two years, I’ve been working on a project for the Raspberry Pi Pico (meanwhile, the Pico 2 has been released, lol). The idea was to create a scheduler with specific features: reliable and highly precise. That’s how &quot;MediumPico&quot; was born.</p> <p>Here are its features:</p> <ul> <li>Remote control via a web interface (web server on pico)</li> <li>Control via MQTT</li> <li>Precision down to the second</li> <li>Logging of executed tasks and errors</li> <li>Multi-threading: the scheduler has a dedicated core</li> <li>Immediate saving of tasks and logs to flash memory for persistence in case of power or connection loss</li> <li>Ability to operate offline</li> <li>Up to 10 tasks can be managed, with each task controlling up to 8 relays</li> <li>A display to show the device&#39;s status</li> </ul> <p><strong>How a Task W

The other thing is that when plugged into my windows PC, the device manager sees the pi zero as a USB serial device and gives me baud rate options, etc. but no accessible folder pops up in file exploder.
