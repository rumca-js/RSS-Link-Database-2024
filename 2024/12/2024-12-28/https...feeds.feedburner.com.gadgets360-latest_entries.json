        "description": "Axial Seamount, an undersea volcano located off the coast of Oregon, is showing signs of an impending eruption, with scientists predicting it could occur as early as 2025. The volcano\u2019s surface has been swelling, and seismic activity is increasing, both of which mirror patterns seen before previous eruptions. Researchers have been closely monitoring the volcano using a sophisticated network of sensors, providing real-time data to help refine eruption forecasts. The use of artificial intelligence to analyse seismic patterns from past eruptions offers new hope for more accurate predictions. While Axial Seamount\u2019s eruption poses minimal direct risk to human populations, improved forecasting could help protect vulnerable coastal areas from potential tsunami threats.",
