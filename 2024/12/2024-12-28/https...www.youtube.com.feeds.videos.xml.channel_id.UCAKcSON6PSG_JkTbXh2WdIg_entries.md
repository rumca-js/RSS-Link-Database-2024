Chicago indie-rock band DEHD are on a bit of a roll. On their most recent album, Poetry, the three-piece band got a little bit more experimental with their sound — something that really came alive as they wrote and recorded songs in a couple of different locations; specifically, in Taos, New Mexico, and on Bainbridge Island in the state of Washington. They also took another new step in bringing a producer into the studio with them. The results proved a bit more creatively satisfying and liberating. 

As further evidence of a more free-wheeling DEHD, the three band members — Emily Kempf, Eric McGrady and Jason Balla — recorded a three-song acoustic set of songs while visiting The Current studio, eschewing drums and bass for a couple of acoustic guitars to accompany their vocals. Watch them perform "Dog Days" above.
