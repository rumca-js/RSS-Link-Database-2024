They also tried to isolate her as much as possible, leading Leelah to write a suicide note online, and she was later found dead. Her parents falsely claimed to lover her and the aftermath and purposefully misgendered her.</p> <p>In her suicide note, she said she wanted her death to mean something. So, as a trans girl myself, I&#39;m writing a character in an original novel of mine that&#39;s a direct homage to her, in the form of a captain of a massive starship. I deeply resonate with her struggles, and I&#39;ve been experiencing similar abusive from my MAGA Christian family. We must keep fighting for our equality. Victory is the greatest tribute we can pay, for those who died under bigotry and oppression. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/B_Wing_83\"> /u/B_W",

Do they ever stop to ask themselves if they are attracted to every opposite sex person they meet? If I like someone, gay or straight or bi or pan or whatever, it does not mean I am sexually attracted. If I love a friend...nope, no physical attraction. There is a bond between humans that transcends sex. I like that bond, the feel of it, the warmth, the familiarity, the joy. But it hardly ever leads to physical attraction. That, at least for me, has been a rare occurrence. So, dear straight people...most people in the LGBT community are not attracted to you.
