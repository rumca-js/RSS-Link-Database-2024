Neither do I have stored any pictures nor sensitive data. I use it only for Signal, YouTube, Reddit and light web browsing. </p> <p>I also have a Pixel 7a, which is used for anything else, but mostly kept in the drawer. I just prefer using the 3a for some reason.</p> <p>I am really anxious about not receiving security updates even if I do not store sensitive data. Is keeping DivestOS for my use case safe? Or should I better switch to LineageOS, which still supports the 3a?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/DerGemeineAutist\"> /u/DerGemeineAutist </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/degoogle/comments/1hobw0c/dumb_phone_use_case_keep_divestos/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/degoogle/comments/1hobw0",
