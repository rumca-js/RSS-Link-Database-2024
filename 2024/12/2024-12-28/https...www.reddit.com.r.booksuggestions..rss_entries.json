I don\u2019t mind if it\u2019s slightly morally grey but there\u2019s a fine line between morally grey and abusive and most dark romances don\u2019t know the difference imo.

It is so challenging for me, every second that I spend reading a book feels like an aeon. My mind refuses to dial in and engage with the material. My scattered focus leaves me frustrated and disconnects me from literature as a whole.</p> <p>What puzzles me is that I can read Reddit stories and scroll through other forums with ease. So why is it so hard for me to have the same experience with books?</p> <p>I just feel so left out to be honest. A lot of my friends read (notably manga) and we bonded over that. I just want to be able to relate with them like I was once able too and build a good habit as a bonus.

I\u2019ve landed on the below. Would love your suggestions on books you\u2019ve enjoyed that might fit each category! If you want to do the whole thing, great, but if you only have a suggestion for a few that\u2019s perfect, too! </p> <p>To give you an idea of what I like, some of my favorite reads the last few years were: - The Nix by Nathan Hill - The Nickel Boys by Colson Underwood - Burial Rites by Hannah Kent - In the Dream House by Carmen Maria Machado - I Who Have Never Known Men by J. Harpman - My Friends by Hisham Matar - Shuggie Bain by Douglas Stuart - Station Eleven by Emily SJM</p> <p>Ok, here is what I\u2019m looking to do: </p> <p>2025 Reading Challenge - [ ] 2025 Release - [ ] 2024 Release - [ ] NYT Bestseller - [ ]",

Some examples: Morisaki Bookshop series - Satoshi Yagisawa What you are looking for is in the library - Michiko Aoyama The Midnight Library - Matt Haig</p> <p>Weirdly enough, these are all related to books as well, but this is not why I enjoyed them.

We are talking Medusa and Poseidon, Persephone dragged into the underworld and drowning in darkness.

I will read modern fiction but would prefer fantasy. Romance doesn&#39;t need to be the front and center of the book. Actually prefer if it&#39;s not the whole plot. Psychological stuff is a bonus.
