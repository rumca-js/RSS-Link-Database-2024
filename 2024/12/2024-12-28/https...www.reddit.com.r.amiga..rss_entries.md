<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am in the U.S., and I have — since the eighties — has my eyes on an Amiga. I would love to get my hands on an AGA-capable model but, that seems in short supply here in the States. </p> <p>Does anyone know a good place to try to find such models? I have tried camping out on eBay and my word they are pricey. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ShortBeardo"> /u/ShortBeardo </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1hoft2j/getting_my_hands_on_an_amiga_in_the_states/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1hoft2j/getting_my_hands_on_an_amiga_in_the_states/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I got AmigaVision working with the MegaAGS right now. However, when I play it on my pocket, I can&#39;t figure out how to exit a game without restarting. Is that posslbe? How do I exit back to the AGS menu without a full restart of the core?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/DorkyMcDorky"> /u/DorkyMcDorky </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1hocxem/amigavision_pocket_question_how_do_i_exit_a_game/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1hocxem/amigavision_pocket_question_how_do_i_exit_a_game/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I&#39;m going to attack my default amiga 1200 config again.</p> <p>Right now I have a 4-ROM switcher. I&#39;d like to reprogram it so I can run the following workbenches:</p> <p>1.3</p> <p>2.0</p> <p>3.1 (AGS)</p> <p>3.2</p> <p>First - would that work? Is it possible to have 1.3 and 2.0 load up on a 1200? I know there&#39;s a floppy that allows you to do it, but can it work OOTB? I&#39;d gamble it wouldn&#39;t but wondering if anyone has ever done a similar setup?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/DorkyMcDorky"> /u/DorkyMcDorky </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1hocvry/a1200_rom_switcher_best_options_for_best/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1hocvry/a1200_rom_switcher_best_options_for_best/">[comments]</a></span>
