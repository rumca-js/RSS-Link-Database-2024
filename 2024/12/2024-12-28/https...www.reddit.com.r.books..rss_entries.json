I would buy some used books instead.

Oathbringer still remains my favorite book of all time.

There were far too many side characters introduced or given unnecessary attention, detracting from the main storyline.

I understand that Jones wanted to originally include even more swearing and sexuality. I am curious to read this uncut edition, has anyone read it? Are there big differences?
