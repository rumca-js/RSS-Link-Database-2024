From the visual musical cuts to the sludgy slapdashery in edits... the story lines and character background that leaves room for a cavalcade of imaginative insinuations by the viewer. The mix of local lore and outsider commentary. </p> <p>Class warfare, psychopathy, transgenerational poverty and the dangers of being walled up in an isolated microculture.

All of her lines sound either forced or emotionless, her crying scenes are as bad as Tamra Judge&#39;s in The Real Housewives of Orange County. </p> <p>Because so much of Love Story is about Jenny dying, you do need to feel a connection but if you can&#39;t believe anything she does or says, it&#39;s up for Ryan O&#39;Neal and Francis Lai, the composer, to do the heavy lifting and they nearly pull it off. </p> <p>It says a lot that MacGraw isn&#39;t in the movie a lot, she never gets her own perspective like O&#39;Neal, the film is more about Oliver than Jenny (even though MacGraw got Top Billing). I wonder if it&#39;s because the director was aware MacGraw didn&#39;t have much range. </p> <p>To be fair to MacGraw, she got better.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Okay, that was a tough watch… This feels like the best John Hughes movie that John Hughes never got to write and direct. The pain of adolescence felt so real! Yet the ending was sort of invalidating of everything that came before, because it seemed to boil down the lead character&#39;s struggles to immaturity and... lack of empathy?</p> <p>The movie is about Nadine, a sardonic teenager played perfectly by Hailee Steinfeld. Nadine never fully recovered from the death of her father, the only person in her family that ever treated her right, because Nadine’s mother, played by Kyra Sedgwick, is a nutcase and only has eyes for Nadine’s brother Darian, played by Blake Jenner. We get the feeling that when they were little the mom used to buy Premium Pampers for precious Darian and sat Nadine on a greasy KFC bucket with two leg holes.</p> <p>Nadine also could be experiencing some undiagnosed form of depression since the death of her father (Kyra and Blake ne

## Kubrick, Lynch, and Von Trier all make you feel uneasy in different ways, and I think it’s interesting how they do it.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Kubrick’s all about that cold, perfect symmetry. His shots are so precise, everything is in its place, and that can make you feel trapped. It’s like he’s designing a world where everything’s just a little too perfect—The Shining and 2001 are prime examples. It’s unsettling because there’s no room for warmth or messiness, just this suffocating control.</p> <p>Lynch also loves symmetry, but he warps it with a surreal, dreamlike quality. It’s less about precision and more about creating a weird, subconscious unease. Movies like Mulholland Drive or Blue Velvet use strange, almost off-putting moments to dig into our fears, memories, and desires. It’s like a nightmare you can’t quite understand, but it sticks with you.</p> <p>Then there’s Von Trier, who throws all that control out the window. His camera’s often shaky, the frames feel off-center, and the whole thing just feels chaotic. Antichrist or Melancholia are all about raw emotion, showing the messine

For me, I definitely could understand how Heather was feeling. With the absolute horror and uncertainty of her situation, as the true extent of the danger she’s in finally becomes clear. Heather felt where she couldn’t even open or close her eyes for fear of what that would entail. Is it Better to Die Awake or Asleep? Aware or Oblivious?
