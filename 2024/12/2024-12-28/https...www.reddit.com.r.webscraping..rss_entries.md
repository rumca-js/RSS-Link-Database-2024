<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m scraping ski resort lift ticket prices and all of the tickets on the Epic Pass implement a &quot;queue&quot; page that has a CAPTCHA. I don&#39;t think the page is always road-blocked by this, so one of my options would be to just wait. I&#39;m using Playwright and after a bit of research I&#39;ve found Playwright stealth. </p> <p>I figured it&#39;d be best to ask people with more experience than me how they&#39;d approach this. Am I better off just waiting for later to scrape? The data is added to a database, so I&#39;d only need to scrape once/day. Would you recommend using Playwright Stealth, or would that even fix my problem? Thanks!</p> <p>Here&#39;s a website that uses this queue as an example (I&#39;m not sure if you&#39;ll consistently get it): <a href="https://www.mountsnow.com/plan-your-trip/lift-access/tickets.aspx?startDate=12/29/2024&amp;numberOfDays=1&amp;ageGroup=Adult">https://www.mountsnow.com/plan-your-trip/lift-access/ticke

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi! I&#39;m looking for advice on overcoming a problem I’ve run into while web scraping a site that has recently tightened its blocking methods.</p> <p>Until recently, I was using a combination of VPN (to rotate IPs and avoid blocks) + Cloudscraper (to handle Cloudflare’s protections). This worked perfectly, but about a month ago, the site seems to have updated its filters, and Cloudscraper stopped working.</p> <p>I switched to Botasaurus instead of Cloudscraper, and that worked for a while, still using a VPN alongside it. However, in the past few days, neither Botasaurus nor the VPNs seem to work anymore. I’ve tried multiple private VPNs, but all of them result in the same Cloudflare block with this error:</p> <p><code>Refused to display &#39;https://XXX.XXX&#39; in a frame because it set &#39;X-Frame-Options&#39; to &#39;sameorigin&#39;.</code></p> <p>It seems Cloudflare is detecting and blocking VPN IPs outright.
