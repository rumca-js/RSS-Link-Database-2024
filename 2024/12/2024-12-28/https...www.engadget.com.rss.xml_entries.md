<p>A set of new requirements proposed by the US Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS) Office for Civil Rights could bring healthcare organizations up to par with modern cybersecurity practices. The <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2024-30983.pdf" data-original-link="https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2024-30983.pdf"><ins>proposal</ins></a>, posted to the Federal Register on Friday, includes requirements for multifactor authentication, data encryption and routine scans for vulnerabilities and breaches. It would also make the use of anti-malware protection mandatory for systems handling sensitive information, along with network segmentation, the implementation of separate controls for data backup and recovery, and yearly audits to check for compliance.</p>

<p>NASA said on Friday that it received a signal from the Parker Solar Probe confirming that the spacecraft had survived its closest ever flyby of the sun. The approach took it just 3.8 million miles from the surface, passing within the sun’s corona and allowing for unprecedented data collection in the vicinity of a star. A few million miles might seem like a pretty great distance, but to put things in perspective, <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://science.nasa.gov/science-research/heliophysics/nasas-parker-solar-probe-makes-history-with-closest-pass-to-sun/" data-original-link="https://science.nasa.gov/science-research/heliophysics/nasas-parker-solar-probe-makes-history-with-closest-pass-to-sun/">NASA</a> explains, “If the solar system was scaled down with the distance between the sun and Earth the length of a football field, Parker Solar Probe would be just four yards from the end zone.”</p>

The company has conducted — and <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.blueorigin.com/news/new-glenn-completes-integrated-launch-vehicle-hotfire">successfully completed</a> — a wet dress rehearsal or a full run-through of the rocket&#39;s launch countdown. As <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/27/science/new-glenn-blue-origin.html"><em>The New York Times</em></a> reports, Blue Origin had to attempt the countdown several times over a few hours, but the company managed to ignite and fire New Glenn&#39;s seven engines for 24 seconds in the end.&nbsp;</p>
<p>New Glenn&#39;s tanks were filled with fuel and the rocket was fitted with a 45,000-pound payload mass simulator as if it truly was heading to space. Blue Origin says this i
