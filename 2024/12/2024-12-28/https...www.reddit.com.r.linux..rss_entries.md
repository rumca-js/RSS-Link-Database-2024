I start the user session on the laptop manualy , then I use my main computer with the windows remote desktop to take control on the laptop (On which, you&#39;ll have understood, I enabled the desktop sharing). </p> <p>This works pretty fine, but I can&#39;t increase the resolution beside the laptop screen resolution (which seems technically understable)</p> <p>But I wonder if there is any way/configuration to virtually increase this resolution up to my main computer screen resolution. The screen of the laptop is pretty small and it&#39;s not confortable at all to work with.</p> <p>Il check all the configuration file/UI I found on the laptop and on RDP, I also tried with vino&amp;VNC without more success.</p> <p>What do you think about it ?</p> <p>Thanks :-]</p> </di
