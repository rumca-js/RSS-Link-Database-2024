The difference was that it was hard and you had to figure out how to do what you wanted, often completely independently, because your parents didn\u2019t know how they worked, or didn\u2019t care to show you. I will never forget the feeling of finally getting dialup to work in a remote location after <em>days</em> of attempts. Or how it felt when I burnt my first CD after fucking with limewire for what felt like 1000 years.</p> <p>So I\u2019m wondering: do we think giving kids a PC or an old PSP or something and saying \u201cyou have no money, figure out how to get Roblox on here, it is possible\u201d or wha",

Does anybody know of similar sites already that don&#39;t do that? Can&#39;t seem to be able to get my hands on any tracker invites either for such stuff...</p> <p>I&#39;ve got aeblender and vfxmed on the list already but was hoping maybe someone has already gone through the 1000+ pages of google search results of Persian etc websites and has directions? Or perhaps even specific search prompts that perhaps I wouldn&#39;t know to use within this context? Tried the Persian &quot;search&quot; addition to other keywords but yeah, a lot to wade through (page 71 atm, yay).</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <",

I have plenty of rips with &quot;ATMOS&quot; in the name, but they don&#39;t have a separate audio track for Atmos. Do Atmos rips just play in Stereo if that&#39;s what you have your PC set to, and if you have Atmos on your PC, will it play the Atmos mix?
