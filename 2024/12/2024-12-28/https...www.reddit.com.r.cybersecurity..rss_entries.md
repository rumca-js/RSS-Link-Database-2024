Cybersecurity and networking remind me of a constant game of cat and mouse. On one side, you‚Äôve got defenders trying to monitor networks, find vulnerabilities, and patch them up. On the other, you‚Äôve got attackers finding new ways to disrupt organizations. It‚Äôs the classic fight between good and bad, and it never really stops.</p> <p>With all the AI-focused solutions popping up, companies are getting better at detecting vulnerabilities and fixing them quickly.
