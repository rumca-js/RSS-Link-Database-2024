With projects like Nightshade (very cool btw) aimed at protecting real artists from copy right infringement, raising in popularity, I have to wonder if it would be an ethical, legal form of protest (hypothetically of course) to further disrupt things like resume readers for big corporations. </p> <p>It seems nonsensical to just sit back and allow a machine (with all of the internet biases) to determine anyone&#39;s ability or worth in a job setting.</p> <p>Does anyone have thoughts on this type of resistance? Ideas? Ethical issues? Legal issues? Is it even possible and feasible to do?</p> <p>I&#39;m just hoping to run this by some minds other then my own and I just haven&#39;t found much discourse on the topic. All opinions are welcome and encouraged.</p> <p>P.s",
