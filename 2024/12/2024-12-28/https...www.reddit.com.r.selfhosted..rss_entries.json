It takes a simple script and allows you to apply a cron schedule to it. The main advantage here is that you can set the script running and dip into the output as and when you need to. I know that you can background a task, etc. Via the CLI, but I wondered if there were any alternatives even if they were CLI based that gave you a slightly easier way of triggering stopping and monitoring scripts that take a while to run.

On the other hand, cloud storage services can be expensive for large storage needs, have high long-term costs, and, most importantly, store data on third-party servers, which compromises privacy.

Right now, I&#39;m just trying to learn.</p> <p>And I learned that my ISP blocks incoming port 80. So I can&#39;t just point my DNS records to my IP and have fun. I did some research and found CF Tunnels. It seems to make sense in my situation. I got it working if I set up a public hostname for each service I&#39;m running. But I want to run Traefik as a reverse proxy and use a wildcard in the tunnel/DNS record and then let Traefik handle routing internally. When I follow the tutorials online to do this however, the traffic never makes it past Cloudflare. I get a 502 error and the traceroute shows the final IP as a Cloudflare server. </p> <p>I posted on the CF forums, but no one responded. Whil",
