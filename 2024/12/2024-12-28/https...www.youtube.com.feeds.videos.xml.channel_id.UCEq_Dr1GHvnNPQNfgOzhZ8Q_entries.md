The Justice League interview a potential new member, Plastic Man! He can stretch! And more! However Batman get's cold feet about it as he explains to Superman that the "and more" is nothing to scoff at. Unless you did, which is the intent. It's meant to be funny. You should be scoffing a lot. Scoffing plenty actually.
