Sometimes I do really feel down yet I made myself and my girl a promise to keep pushing. I&#39;m also going hand to hand to rehap on a bad habit. Anyways... my content is Sekiro oriented since my first sekiro content hit 900 views with 40 subs. Before that I was publishing indie games and they hit 200 views at best.</p> <p>Now Im stuck with like 6 more sekiro videos and best was 500.</p> <p>I&#39;m still having hard time finding my niche and I don&#39;t wanna let go.</p> <p>I hope you haven&#39;t got bored reading.
