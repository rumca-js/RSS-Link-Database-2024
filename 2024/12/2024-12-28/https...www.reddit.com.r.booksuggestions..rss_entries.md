<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Heya, I am looking for spicy books I can find on my Nook. I love dark and twisted books, paranormal or fantasy books preferred I also like sci-fi (the love interest doesn’t have to be another species) can anyone recommend something that is written well with a good plot? I loved reading Her Soul To Take by Harley Laroux but noticed that they don’t have a lot of their books on Nook.

Think of things like: LOTR, Shadowhunters, Leigh Bardugo’ Grishaverse, etc. I never read shadowhunters but I’ve watched the show and enjoyed it, and my older sister also enjoyed the books. I adore LOTR, so I suppose the main thing I’m looking for is something similar to that. And I adore the Grishaverse.</p> <p>No dark romances please, especially not the super super dark ones. I don’t mind if it’s slightly morally grey but there’s a fine line between morally grey and abusive and most dark romances don’t know the difference imo. I don’t mind smut, or romance, but I prefer the main point to be the plot and not the romance.</p> <p>Thankyou in advance :] (Bonus points if they’re on KU)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/DeliriousToothy"> /u/DeliriousToo

I’ve read a couple of their other books and didn’t love them as much, but that one was great. I just started the Right Move by Liz Tomforde but it’s a bit too spicy for me so I stopped. I also wasn’t a big fan of the writing style. Not usually rom coms, but I adore Liane Moriarty books as well if that helps! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/kainani_s"> /u/kainani_s </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1ho91ia/rom_coms_with_mild_spice/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1ho91ia/rom_coms_with_mild_spice/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’m shooting to read 30 books in 2025. I find I enjoy reading most when I’m consuming a diverse range of books - different genres, authors, languages (translated), etc., so I was on the lookout for a challenge that would help me achieve that. I’ve landed on the below. Would love your suggestions on books you’ve enjoyed that might fit each category! If you want to do the whole thing, great, but if you only have a suggestion for a few that’s perfect, too! </p> <p>To give you an idea of what I like, some of my favorite reads the last few years were: - The Nix by Nathan Hill - The Nickel Boys by Colson Underwood - Burial Rites by Hannah Kent - In the Dream House by Carmen Maria Machado - I Who Have Never Known Men by J. Harpman - My Friends by Hisham Matar - Shuggie Bain by Douglas Stuart - Station Eleven by Emily SJM</p> <p>Ok, here is what I’m looking to do: </p> <p>2025 Reading Challenge - [ ] 2025 Release - [ ] 2024 Release - [ ] NYT Bestseller - [ ]

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>When I look back at the books I enjoyed most in 2024, I realise that they have one thing in common: the main characters are all unhappy in their current lives and are looking for a change. Some examples: Morisaki Bookshop series - Satoshi Yagisawa What you are looking for is in the library - Michiko Aoyama The Midnight Library - Matt Haig</p> <p>Weirdly enough, these are all related to books as well, but this is not why I enjoyed them. I am currently the cliche of a depressed person who feels stuck in her life, that is why I would love to read more inspiring stories of people who manage to turn their lives around.

I will read modern fiction but would prefer fantasy. Romance doesn&#39;t need to be the front and center of the book. Actually prefer if it&#39;s not the whole plot. Psychological stuff is a bonus.
