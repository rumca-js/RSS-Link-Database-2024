That is more or less my standard setup with the ol&#39; reliable C64.</p> <p>Now the question: What do I need to convert the 4:3 (480p or 576p) output from the ODV (or the AppleII | C64) to 16:9 (720p or 1080p) the dumb monitor understands? The monitor itself works with let\u00b4s say a standard RaspberryPi at 1920x1080 or 1280x720, so it\u00b4s not broken. But if I set the resolution of the Pi to 640x480 the monitor just says &quot;no support&quot;.<br/",

They had a great selection of comic books, merchandise, some playable pinball machines, but their prices just got too greedy and it&#39;s not surprising to see them go. The fact that they stayed open this long in a dead shopping center (The Hamilton Mall), its a miracle they survived this long. I had many memories buying a lot of things there throughout the years but anything I saw there I could buy for much cheaper online.
