<p>You may have already experienced it yourself with a new desktop PC or notebook: After the final installation of Windows 11, the desktop is covered in icons — much of which is bloatware. Common culprits are test versions of security suites and virus scanners as well as programs for image editing, photo books, and cloud services.</p>
