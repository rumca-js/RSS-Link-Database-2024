It&#39;s one thing to state unconditionally that AI will replace MDs, it&#39;s another to claim that it&#39;ll happen in 8-10 years. I&#39;ve also seen people argue that 25% of skilled jobs will be automated within 5 years, or that this is going to start happening across the board in 2025. </p> <p>The question here is not if it&#39;s possible, it&#39;s how you think it&#39;ll happen in the timeframe you think it will. People don&#39;t seem to appreciate how much back and forth there is between research and development before a product is feasible, how much work it takes to go from a proof of concept to a viable product, or what a realistic timeline looks like for the widespread adoption of an existing product/solution/system.</p> <p>For the sake of discussi

However, I often see posts on various tech subs (<a href="/r/singularity">r/singularity</a> being the worst at this) that seem to treat LLMs as more than just computational tools. Some even suggest that AGI and ASI are just around the corner. It seems kind of obvious that the vague hinting at AGI hype by certain LLM companies is a useful marketing strategy.</p> <p>I also frequently see comparisons between AI/LLMs and the human brain. But the human brain is far more complex than LLM architecture. It’s a biological organ: squishy, wet, and unpredictable— with various neuron types, functional diversity, varying electrophysiology, neurotransmitters, and a non-linear, dynamic mode of operation. Comparing an LLM architecture to the brain is a bit like comparing a bird to an airplane: you can draw parallels, but they’re fundamentally diffe

Essentially, the model constructs agent prompts in real time to improve its output.</p> <p>Since the LLM itself is becoming less relevant while ICL algorithms are comparatively fast and cheap to implement, smart startup founders can now compete with big players rather than merely creating niche AI wrappers.</p> <p>O3 is a clear sign that the LLM itself is turning into a commodity, and that ICL—combined with other “simple” algorithms—will significantly surpass the performance of traditional approaches, pavi

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I came across an article on Perplexity claiming &quot;AI Chatbots Show Dementia,&quot; and I find this assertion baffling. Chatbots are powered by large language models (LLMs), which are essentially computational processes designed to predict the next word based on input. While LLMs may appear &quot;creative&quot; due to a parameter like temperature, which introduces variability, they remain probabilistic computation systems.</p> <p>Unlike biological brains, LLMs operate in a digital space that doesn’t degrade or &quot;forget&quot; in the human sense. Their functionality depends on physical hardware, which can fail but is replaceable. The digital data itself, encoded as binary (0s and 1s), persists unless deliberately erased. The idea of erosion or memory loss doesn’t apply to this realm—at least not until we introduce quantum computing at scale.</p> <p>Here’s the article:<br/> <a href="https://www.perplexity.ai/page/ai-chatbots-show-dementia-zhAIfit

It’s a platform that utilizes several API’s such as llama, Claude, perplexity and chatgpt. It can dedicate time to summarize your pdf’s. If you are on a time constraint, you can use the platform to watch summarize youtube videos.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>AI is coming whether we like it or not—it’s just a matter of how soon and how much it’ll shape every field out there. From healthcare and education to art, engineering, and farming, AI is already making a huge impact. It can handle boring tasks, crunch massive amounts of data, and give us insights we’d never figure out on our own. Even people who don’t trust AI will end up using it because it’ll be too useful to ignore. As it keeps getting better, AI won’t just help us do things faster—it’ll change the way we think, work, and create.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/TheLogiqueViper"> /u/TheLogiqueViper </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1hmd51r/stop_seeing_what_humans_can_do_and_ai_cant_and/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1hmd51r/stop_seeing_what_humans_can_do_and_ai_cant_and/">[comments
