<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Does anyone else feel, especially when they are playing something original on a preferred instrument , that what is being played is “already there”? I quite literally feel like when I play a guitar solo that I am pulling the notes off a sheet of music that has already been written. When I go about my day I always hear melodies in my surroundings or reminders of licks I love. Does anyone else feel this way, or am I delusional?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/hngl_mccringleberrry"> /u/hngl_mccringleberrry </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1hmdmfh/bear_with_me/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1hmdmfh/bear_with_me/">[comments]</a></span>
