<p>Liverpool have kicked off at 8pm on a Boxing Day twice in their history. The first time was in 2019, when Jürgen Klopp’s team demolished Leicester en route to winning the Premier League title with ease. The second time ended with another convincing defeat of the Foxes. That may not be the only repeat.</p><p>Arne Slot’s soaring leaders moved seven points clear of their closest challengers for the title, with a game in hand, courtesy of a controlled comeback against Ruud van Nistelrooy’s side. Leicester took a shock early lead through Jordan Ayew and, while Liverpool never hit the heights of their 2019 performance at the King Power Stadium, goals from Cody Gakpo, Curtis Jones and Mohamed Salah’s 19th of the season ensured the outcome remained the same.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/dec/26/mo-salah-rounds-off-liverpool-recovery-to-sink-leicester-and-stretch-lead">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Since they were piloted in 2008, these courts have expanded their reach across England, writes <strong>Miranda Paris</strong></p><p>Jane Lawson (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/law/2024/dec/17/the-role-of-courts-in-tackling-addiction">Letters, 17 December</a>), extolled the virtues of the late Nicholas Crichton and his implementation of family drug and alcohol courts (FDACs) at Wells Street in London. However, FDACs were not “all destroyed” following the closure of courts like Wells Street. FDACs are still operating to this day. Since they were piloted in 2008, their reach has expanded: there are now 13 FDAC services that cover 38 local authorities across England and 21 family courts, with additional services due to open in 2025. A national evaluation of FDACs published in 2023 found that children were four times more likely to be reunited with their parents at the end of proceedings compared with similar families in non-FDAC care proceedings.

Perhaps Neto might be better served trying to tackle with his feet in future.</p><p>But there was no debate about the winner, which arrived five minutes into added time, tucked in calmly by the sub Rodrigo Muniz, reward for a relentless second-half display, and a moment that left the Fulham bench leaping and writhing in a full bobbing huddle on the touchline.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/dec/26/chelsea-fulham-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

It is the cue for analysts at Deutsche Bank to remind investors how much can change in the course of 25 years, in this case from the days when Nokia phones and fax machines, rather than iPhones and Amazon, were everyday features of life.</p><p>Here’s one jaw-dropper: back in sunny days of 1999, there was a live debate as to when the US would pay down its entire stock of government debt. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) reckoned the glorious day would arrive sometime in 2013. In reality, borrowing headed in the other direction almost immediately – and the US debt-to-GDP ratio is now above 100%. The CBO reckons annual deficits will take th

He once mailed himself across the US in a wooden crate. He says things like: “What would happen if the camera was Buddhist?” and, until now, he has never made a feature film. Not the obvious candidate to entrust with adapting a Pulitzer-winning novel, you might think, yet Ross has managed to make a movie that is socially impassioned and highly awards-friendly – and so avant garde that it almost reinvents cinema.</p><p>In its subject matter alone, Nickel Boys is remarkable: adapted from Colson Whitehead’s novel, it follows two young Black boys at a segregated reform school in Florida in the 1960s. It is a story of friendship in the face of racism, injustice, abuse and even murder. The setting is based on the infamous real-life <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/

<p>From orgasm-drama Slip to gorgeous comedy We Might Regret This, there’s been so much brilliant TV this year that you may have let some corkers pass you by. Here are the finest shows to catch up on now</p><p>The premise sells itself: a thirtysomething woman is transported to a parallel life each time she orgasms. But, actually, this lends itself surprisingly well to digging deep into millennial frustrations, anxiety and ennui. Zoe Lister-Jones plays Mae Cannon, a New York art curator who feels stuck in a rut with her life – specifically with her longterm husband. When she cheats with another man, she wakes up in a new life where she married him, and so the cycle begins, with each new relationship forcing Mae to re-examine her identity and ideals. Does she want, or get, her original life back? No spoilers here, but without ever zapping the smart, sharp comedy that carries it through, this introspection is relatable for many. <em>Watch it on ITVX</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguar

<p>Based on a massacre in an Austrian town at the end of the second world war, this thoughtful novel confronts the long shadow of Nazism</p><p>In the small Austrian town of Darkenbloom, near the Hungarian border, tempers are flaring at a&nbsp;public meeting. The mayor gives a&nbsp;speech; the vintner explodes in protest. Some cheer, while others bang on tables. The vintner declares that he&nbsp;is tired of deception. “Scratch the surface with your fingernail anywhere in Darkenbloom,” he shouts,&nbsp;“and you uncover some new abomination!” He is right, and not just&nbsp;about dodgy council dealings. Darkenbloom is a town of nasty, close-held secrets: a place where it is dangerous, sometimes even&nbsp;fatal, to expose the truth.</p><p>Unearthing, digging up and truth-hunting run through Darkenbloom, the latest novel by the Berlin-based Austrian author Eva Menasse.

To the uninformed, here is a brief primer on 2024’s hottest It-mammal.</p><p>On 10 July 2024, a female pygmy hippo was born at the Khao Kheow Open Zoo in Thailand, to mother Jona and father Tony. The zoo launched a public poll to choose a name for the infant. There were three meat-themed names to choose from: Moo Deng (bouncy pork), Moo Sap (minced pork) and Moo Daeng (red pork). Moo Deng won with 20,000 votes and soon captured the world’s imagination. Photographs of the infant – a slippery, chaotic and yes, bouncy beast shaped like a large potato, with a rolling eye, frequently open mouth and seemingly strong opinions – brought wonder to a jaded world.</p> <a

But eventually there will be nowhere left for them to go</p><p></p><p>Built like a small bison, weighing as much as a grand piano and covered in thick, shaggy coat, the musk ox is one of the most distinctive species in the high Arctic. But from a hill on Greenland’s tundra, they seem impossible to find.</p><p>Each bush, rock and clump of grass resembles a mass of wool and horns in the blustery chill on the edge of the island’s enormous polar ice cap.

<p>When we get into the actual games, the smash-kit K-drama finds its feet. But it spends far too many episodes dragging its heels extremely painfully. Series three must do better</p><p>One of Hollywood’s many bad habits is the bloat caused by splitting a story in half in a bid to double the profits (cough, cough, Dune and Wicked). Squid Game was always a perfect one-series story. Gambling addict Seong Gi-hun (Lee Jung-jae) became Player 456, a desperate man who attempts to pay off his debts by taking part in a twisted underground fight-to-the-death competition. He beats the odds by surviving every one of its potentially fatal playground games.
