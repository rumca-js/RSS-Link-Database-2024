WELCOME TO SPEARHEADZ! This casual gaming series is going to explore Warhammer's new format of fixed-list casual gaming. This wide-onramp new system for playing Games Workshop's cosmic-fantasy wargame is perfect for the kitchen-table game crowd and is perfectly suited for where I'm at with gaming. 

Chase is in with the THUNDERBROTHERS of the Sons of Behemat to take on the fishy raiders of the Idoneth Deepkin. More SPEARTIPZ today as well!
