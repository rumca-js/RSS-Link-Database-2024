But anyway I have this Pinterest account where I saved very very gay things like memes, masc outfits, or some of my celebrity crushes. On Dec 21 So my mom opened my phone and went on Pinterest (like a mom would do to any young teen) and saw everything I saved. When I opened up my phone when I got it back my soul left my body cuz I didn&#39;t think she liked gay people cuz she has said some questionable things.I saw my Pinterest profile. She didn&#39;t say anything until the next morning, it felt really good discussing it with her she promised to not tell my dad until I was ready. but also offered conversion therapy (Idfk where she would get it it&#39;s illegal where I live but that might change when trumps in office) I declined because it&#39;s a harmful science that I don&#39;t want to be involved in.

We have our first round of IUI treatment in November and weren&#39;t expecting for it to be successful on our first try - due to the fact that my wife (who is carrying) had a very low follicle count. We are obviously over the moon that we have been successful on the first try and also aware that we are still in the very early days of the pregnancy. I am feeling so anxious and worried about telling my best friend about the due date, even though I know that she will be absolutely over the moon for us that we are having a baby. I know that the likelihood of us being able to attend the wedding is extremely slim, as it is four hours away from where we live but I also want to be completely open with her about the fact that we will probably not be there. Any advice on breaking the news? We really want to do a pr

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am closeted 22M gay, living in a Christian family and community. Living in a closet feels like a torture. The guilt I am feeling when my parents don&#39;t know I have a same sex partner, but at the same time I felt the need to embrace my true self. The guilt I feel when I know to myself that they are really good parents because they always provide things for us and have sacrificed a lot just for us to have a good education, but in my head, I plan to run away from this family in the time they won&#39;t accept me. The guilt I feel when I feel that my churchmates are genuinely willing to build relationship with me but they do not know that I already do not believe in Christianity anymore. Thinking about how long I have to play this role makes me very sad. Sometimes I wish that one day I wake up bein straight so I won&#39;t have this type of dilemma. I am tired of having a superficial relationship with my family, wearing a mask for so long.</p> </div><

I was raised as a traditional catholic and although I&#39;ve stopped attending for a multitude of reasons my parents and at least half of my friends still attend. (No Hate to them of, it just wasn&#39;t working for me) But since I&#39;ve stopped going to church I know my parents feel like they&#39;ve failed in some way. They love me so much and just want the best for me and I feel like telling them might hurt them due to their beliefs. Also since I&#39;m attracted to girls and boys there&#39;s a chance I&#39;ll never date a girl, plus I&#39;m moving out pretty far after high school and if I did date girls they wouldn&#39;t have to know unless it got serious. I feel like it&#39;s just best to leave it be for now but I also don&#39;t want to lie. I think most of my friends wouldn&#39;t care but I do have a few who are catholic so idk how telling them would go down. An
