<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Overall: I would be okay with more stories from the LoTR universe told through this medium. A lot of fantasy would work well with being animated rather than through live-action.</p> <p>Animation: I saw it going in with no expectations for better or for worse. When the trailer first came out, the style of animation reminded of me the slow FPS animation of Castlevania, but my impression after watching it is that the animation is more detailed and fluid than in the trailer. There were some choppy moments with character movements as they were trying to animate the movement in a way that seemed natural rather than animated. Even though a Japanese studio animated the film, it tones down expressions and movements that you would see in a typical Japanese animation.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi Reddit literary sleuths. My father has been looking for a book that he read years ago and I would like to try and find it for him. He didn’t know the author, but he did share some of the plot. Quoting him, “ Years ago, I read an anthology of dragon stories. In it, a dragon told his story in a dragonish sort of English and in clever humor. Some of the plot points included carrying an abducted princess to his cave. She was naked on top of a castle sunning herself when he found her and abducted her. She was rescued by an inept knight.” Does anyone remember it? Is this enough to go on? To me it felt like an old Piers Anthony book, or maybe the “castle for sale” series? I don’t know, but I am sure one of you does. Please help me find that series for him.

No good dragons (St. George killed a dragon = dragon bad. But I was thinking of The Wizard of Earthsea)</p> <p>I was reading Dune and she asked so I started explaining very roughly and then reading her a bit and she loved it. Asked for something like this. Note: She liked the Baron Harkonnen because she too doesn’t like and wants to get rid of a family member that doesn’t respect her and her property. She didn’t mind (I think she liked) that there were female priests, the Bene Gesserit. Note 2: We are Cretan-Greek, for those that known what that means, so she loves a vendetta and getting back at those who wronged you. </p

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I literally just finished the book an hour ago. I loved it and heartily recommend.</p> <p>However, the title doesn&#39;t make sense. This feels foolish, but I&#39;ll ask anyway: Why is the Tainted Cup called The Tainted <em>Cup</em>?</p> <p>It&#39;s specifically the &quot;cup&quot; part I&#39;m confused about. There&#39;s mention of <span class="md-spoiler-text">a tainted teapot. Also, a tainted ewer of some kind. Two tainted bathtubs.</span> But where&#39;s the cup? Am I being stupid? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/bogrollben"> /u/bogrollben </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1hmcdg9/why_is_the_tainted_cup_called_the_tainted_cup/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1hmcdg9/why_is_the_tainted_cup_called_the_tainted_cup/">[comments]</a></span>
