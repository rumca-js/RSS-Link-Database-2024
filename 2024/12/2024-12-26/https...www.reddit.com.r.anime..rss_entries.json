I really like in anime where they draw someone differently, as a way to extra express the emotions they are feeling or add to the humor of the situation. I especially like when it&#39;s meta and diagetic, like they acknowledge the difference (for example, in the first episode of maid sama, she gets embarrassed and turns into a &quot;grey blob&quot; and someone else is like &quot;eww what is that thing, or someone grows mushrooms and that is acknowledged). I&#39;m looking for anime that utilizes this a lot. Im fine with any genre, although I do especially like Hunter X Hunter, where it&#39;s serious but broken up with these cute things (but they don&#39;t utilize near enough for my tastes).

One of the aspects that stood out for me was how the characters were goofy and silly without being annoying and irritating, which is rare in many shounen anime. This highlights how great the characters are written. The format of the anime also reminded me of my favorite anime, Mob Psycho. I love the balance between serious missions and slice of life episodes where the characters interact and develop meaningful relationships with each other. It&#39;s always a joy to see this mix of intense action followed by character growth. </p> <p>Are there other anime that follow the same structure? It doesn&#39;t have to specifically revolve around espers, spirits or aliens. I am just looking for something that combines high-stake scenes with lighthearted moments.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.",
