Attic air leak tips…gaps between the top plate and drywall can make rooms feel cold. Plus the top plate can be hard to reach. For this situation I use Great Stuff Wide Spray. It completely seals air leaks and stops drafts during the winter. Many thanks to @greatstufffoam for sponsoring this project.
