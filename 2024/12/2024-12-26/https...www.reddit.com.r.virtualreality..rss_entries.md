<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone!</p> <p>Ive been playing vr with my quest 2 on pc for years now and have loved it, however i would love to upgrade into something newer with a better FOV. I haven&#39;t particularly kept up the vr world as much as I once did due to being happy with my quest, but its service is coming to an end and its time to move on.</p> <p>What are some recommendations for a headset upgrade at the mid-end?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi folks! I&#39;ve been looking to get into VR for a long time now (years), and it feels like these days the conversation is absolutely dominated by the Quest 3 with the occasional mention of the PSVR 2, unless you start looking at Bigscreen/Varjo/etc. territory. I know other companies can&#39;t subsidize like Meta does, but I just wish there were more choices. I tried a Quest 3 in Best Buy and I wasn&#39;t extremely impressed. The image felt very flat and lifeless which I know is a common complaint with it, I&#39;ve tried some others in the past (I don&#39;t remember which ones, they were like corporate demos or whatever) and those honestly just blew me away and felt so <em>real</em> in a way the Quest didn&#39;t. I don&#39;t have a lot of space near my PC for a wired headset, but would something like a PSVR2 or a used Vive/Index still make sense assuming I could make room to use it? I have a 3080 so that could work. I mostly want to play Beat Saber

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>so im wondering. Iv been interested in fbt projects for a while. And i have plans on making slime vr at some point. But could i get just a ps move settup with more than 3 tracking points set up? Since price compared to what i get i suppose is ok. I could get 4 cameras and 9 controllers for about $200 and just want it as a temporarry solution and multi point tracking if possible. I also know about the models that people use to mod the controllers to be more comfoetable to wear. Later on my plan is to run full slime with lucidbvr gloves too. All this will be paired up with a pico 4 running over to pc with virtual desktop streamer. But i wonder if this would be a good deal if its possible with multi points rather than just hips and feet. &quot;Not that i need more but if i can id do it.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’ve dealt with DPDR (depersonalization/derealization) for over 15 years since I was a child, about 7 or 8. I still remember getting my first VR headset, the Oculus Rift, while I was at university. The first few times I used it, it triggered some seriously intense DPDR episodes—way more intense than what I was used to. It was like my usual derealization had been cranked up to 11, and it honestly freaked me out.</p> <p>But here’s the thing—I really wanted to play. So I kept using it despite the discomfort, and over time, something shifted. I started to <em>expect</em> the intensified DPDR feelings whenever I used VR, and somehow that expectation made the experience feel less threatening. Slowly, I stopped being afraid of it.</p> <p>Eventually, I became so desensitized that those same feelings of DPDR—both in VR and in general—just didn’t bother me anymore. These days, I’m still a regular VR user. Sure, if I go for a super long session after taking a b

Setting up a good 6 or 6E router (capable of 2400 Mbps) as an access point mostly makes sense, except for one thing. A lot of these routers only have a ethernet bandwidth of 1000 Mbps, doesn&#39;t that directly restrict its performance as an access point to 1000 Mbps? This is just confusing since a lot of people rave about the importance of 2400 Mbps, or at least how it makes a big difference, but how?</p> <p>I&#39;m all pretty new to this stuff, so maybe there&#39;s a simple explanation I&#39;m missing here. Thanks for any and all help!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ArinkRinkRink"> /u/ArinkRinkRink </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1hmhc50/whats_the_point_of_buying_a_wifi_6e

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone,</p> <p>I&#39;ve been diving into VR headsets for a while and trying to figure out which one offers the best value for money. After doing some research and considering factors like price, performance, and overall user experience, the Meta Quest 3 (at €550) seems to be the best deal at the moment.</p> <p>From what I&#39;ve seen, it strikes a good balance with its solid resolution (2064 x 2208 per eye), a 120 Hz refresh rate, and the ability to be used wirelessly via Air Link or with a wired connection via USB-C to my PC for SteamVR games. It seems like a really versatile option.</p> <p>I&#39;m not necessarily looking for the absolute highest performance, but rather something that’s efficient and still offers solid performance. The Meta Quest 3 seems to offer that sweet spot where it’s practical and effective, without compromising too much on the VR experience.</p> <p>I’ve also read a lot about the controllers, and while they seem like a s
