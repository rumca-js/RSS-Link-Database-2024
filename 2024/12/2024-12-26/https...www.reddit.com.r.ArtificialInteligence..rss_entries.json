It\u2019s a platform that utilizes several API\u2019s such as llama, Claude, perplexity and chatgpt. It can dedicate time to summarize your pdf\u2019s. If you are on a time constraint, you can use the platform to watch summarize youtube videos. It also includes music and art generation at a cheaper cost than most other platforms.</p> <p><a href=\"https://ninjatools.ai\">https://ninjatools.ai</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/imperialsheriff\"> /u/imperialsheriff </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligenc",
