<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Regardless of distro Linux is like two operating systems. One is a beautiful headless system filled with a rich and modular ecosystem, the other is a fragmented desktop mess. Wayland/X11, Pulseaudio/Pipewire, Qt/GDK, etc.</p> <p>Why can&#39;t we have a modular and unified desktop server instead of separate display/audio servers? A user could hot swap different components, like, the display component, the audio component, the compositor component, the window manager component, the accessibility component, the global keyboard shortcuts component, the tab switcher component, the panel component, and so on.</p> <p>IMO this would be better than different desktop environments.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/aquanoid1"> /u/aquanoid1 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1hmrtzl/linux_desktop/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1hm

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I tend to dual boot my systems and while I understand not every use case will be supported, I just saw two separate distros fail to install using suggested settings.</p> <p>I really like CachyOS on my Legion Go, so I figured it would be a great option on my new laptop. Before knowing I&#39;d keep it, I had just used the OEM 512 GB SSD. CachyOS got the whole thing and all was well.( Use Plasma , the other desktops have weird issues).</p> <p>Then after I fell in love with the device, I decided to upgrade my SSD to a 2TB( on 2280 drives this is like 90 to 100$). Reinstalled Windows and then left a full 1TB empty for CachyOS.</p> <p>Tell CachyOS to use its guided share a drive partioning. It either tried to use the Windows EFI drive , or created one that was too small. The install failed. </p> <p>To be honest this wasn&#39;t too surprising since it also fails when trying to dual boot on the Go.</p> <p>The fix is to manually create two patterns.</p> <p>On
