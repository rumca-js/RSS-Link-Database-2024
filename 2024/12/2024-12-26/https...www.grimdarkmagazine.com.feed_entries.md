<p>Last Updated on December 26, 2024 When I asked the team for the best science fiction, fantasy, and horror books of 2024, I expected a bit of a mixed bag. There is some absolutely epic reading coming out in 2025 but this year felt, at first, like it had been a little lean in the grimdark and dark SFF world. Seeing what the team enjoyed reading this year, I, of course, was wrong. It&#8217;s easy to forget across the course of a whole year, 300+ book reviews, and all the other things released around the book world that there has been some amazing reading published this year. Even looking back our favourite reads of 2024 so far in July, I should have known better. Fortunately for you, the team has come up with a list for the ages, with plenty in there for a wide range of readers, all with the things we know you love&#8211;grim stories set in a dark world told by morally grey characters. Sit back this Boxing Day, and pick a few books to pad out your TBR pile. Empire of the Damned by Ja
