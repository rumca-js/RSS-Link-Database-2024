        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hello all, I&#39;m not too experienced in networks or scraping, but I&#39;ve been investigating how to retrieve backend API endpoints of betting sites. Some were easier than others, however, William Hill&#39;s was interesting. They had a spoof API that would give placeholder/false odds data.</p> <p>These placeholder values would render for a few frames in the frontend before getting updated with the real odds values.</p> <p>Going further to the rabbit hole, I&#39;ve found that there are websocket connections that has a strong correlation of receiving data when the frontend values updates (Hard copium rn). Upon establishing a connection to the websocket, and replicating the necessary headers and responses by inspecting the networks tab, I&#39;ve found that most of these data are encoded and are unreadable. Although, it seems the responses that we send back to the websocket seems to be a request for the client to subscribe to a certain match event.</p>",
