But my friend circle really changed during/after covid and I really fell off playing them. But I would love to play some again! </p> <p>Favorites include all seasons of pandemic legacy, gloomhaven, betrayal, shadows of brimstone, Arkham Horror if it&#39;s coop and legacy/campaign I&#39;m pretty much willing to play it. But I don&#39;t really know what&#39;s come out in the genre in the last 5 years.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>A friend from my game group is a bit of a Kickstarter fanatic and gifted me some games that he never played or only played once. He even very generously wrapped them! I unwrapped them and, to my surprise, one of them was Food Chain Magnate, a game I have been wanting to at least try for years but couldn&#39;t bring myself to spend the 120+ dollars to purchase it! I have gone over the rules several times and can&#39;t wait to get it to the table.</p> <p>I also received a copy of Martin Wallace&#39;s Rocketmen. I have skimmed the rules a bit and it seems like a solid little deckbuilder, but I haven&#39;t really had a deep dive into it.</p> <p>Lastly, he gave me a brand new Galactic Box edition of Voidfall, which I am very excited to start a solo campaign of. The rulebook looks like a bit of a bear (perhaps comparable to Gloomhaven?) but I am nonetheless grateful to my friend for such awesome Christmas presents!</p> <p>If you have played any of these ga
