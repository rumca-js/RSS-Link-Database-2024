My fiance and her mom wanted to contribute to my collection so they both gave me Christmas money. I\u2019m a super indecisive person and I struggle to make decisions when it comes to \u201cbig\u201d purchases. I want a Modretro chromatic. Specifically the GameStop version. With the matching headphones. I also really want a GameCube. There is also an N64 in box with the atomic purple controller at an antique shop near me. I don\u2019t own any GameCube or N64 games at the moment but Zoids Battle Legends and Wind Waker and Pokemon Colusseum are both on my list.

Everything starts okay, then at some point the drop-outs start happening and the heatsink is noticeably hot to the touch, like 60C or so by feel. </p> <p>During use with 240p/480i/p (PS, PS2, GameCube, OG Xbox) sources, the unit also heats up significantly, bot not as much as drop-outs don&#39;t occur...or at least they don&#39;t occur during my normal multi-hour sessions with 22-23C ambient. Maybe during summer it will become a problem. Is this normal behavior or could I screw up somewhere during either firmware or hardware installation that could result in these elevated temps?</p> <p>I initially thought - screw it, I&#39;ll just hook up a fan to the unit to cool it down.
