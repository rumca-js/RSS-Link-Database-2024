I can see selfhosted music streaming via Jellyfin, Amplifi, Plex, etc, but nothing that quite fits the scenario I&#39;m looking for. </p> <p>Scenario: Many people are at a house at a party. We have bluetooth speakers, but someone then must hold the phone/tablet and control the music. What I want is for guests to be able to scan a QR code that goes to a web interface where they can scroll through the library and request songs, and if they see one they like, add it to the queue. This allows it to be unattended. Alternatively, something like a kiosk where you can set up a tablet to do that. </p> <p>Ideally, you could also cast to multiple speakers, since people will be both indoor and in the pool outside. Also ideally, no auth is needed, but an admin can do things like remove songs from the playlist. Also ideally light enough to run on a Pi, but not strictly needed.<",

When you&#39;re managing hundreds of sets and pieces occasionally go missing (as they do!), it becomes really challenging to keep track of everything with existing tools.</p> <h1>What can it do?</h1> <ul> <li><strong>Track multiple copies of the same set</strong> - Each set gets a unique ID, so you can track different missing pieces across duplicate sets</li> <li><strong>Manage missing pieces<",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi guys! I am considering of creating a new forum for a little fun, by hosting a current open-source forum software and making some changes and tweaks . An independent place on the Internet without any outside influence or interference. </p> <p>I plan to make it a place similar to 4chan in its glory days, without all of the illegality of the forum, as well as without all of the chaos that 4chan known for. </p> <p>The community would be like a mini Internet, where people can discuss about things, share stuffs and information. A place for everyone to talk about current events, or share their amazing stories and projects with everyone, or meet new friends (as some of the plans for the features of the community). The community would be tightly moderated (so the software needed to have moderation tools) too. It could even be an alternative to Reddit without karma ofc in the future (as an example of mass and usage example) but I only expect at most of 0.1%",

I&#39;ve got everything setup, as in all the RR apps, Plex, etc. I&#39;ve also added Traefik in the front, bought my own domain and used Cloudflare for DNS hosting and security (enabled some WAF rules for geo-fencing). I&#39;m exposing through Traefik just Overseerr, Plex and Grafana dashboards.</p> <p>From what I see Cloudflare adds automatically HTTPS to the requests served so I didn&#39;t generate my own certificate and add it in Traefik yet. Not 100% sure about this service though.</p> <p>My question is: is this enough security for a home media server? Am I exposing my network to some crazy risks by doing this? Any recommendations?</p> <p>Note 1: I&#39;m planning to share it to some friends outside of my home network too.</p> <p>Note 2: I&#39;ve only forwarded and opened ports 80 and 443.</p> <p>Note 3: I&#39;m not hosting any kind of important data ",

I\u2019m using Calibre/Calibre-Web and I haven\u2019t dug too far into them, but what I\u2019m looking for now is the following:</p> <ul> <li>A comparable solution to something like Overseerr+Prowlarr+Radarr/Sonarr but geared towards books.</li> <li>I\u2019m not certain if Calibre/Web does this but to auto send to my Kindle, Boox or iPad when a new book is imported.</li> <li>I am using Tachiyomi for manga, but Calibre to auto import and covert to epub. Not sure if there are any specific settings that would help them look better on e-ink.</li> </ul> <p>Any help or advice is appreciated! I basically want to stand up an easy discovery, archive and distribute path to all my devices.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Spudly2319\"> /u/Spudly2319 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/commen",

My usage has been primarily for data hoarding purposes and I haven&#39;t really made an effort to create a nice viewing experience.</p> <p>I&#39;d really like something that&#39;s easy for the kids to watch, so clients for Roku, Chromecast, Android tablets, etc. would be a huge plus for me. Somewhat less important but still a positive would be ease of administration for my non-technical wife.</p> <p>Right now I&#39;m eyeballing TubeArchivist + Jellyfin (with the TubeArchivist plugin). I don&#39;t currently have either of these set up so I&#39;m not sure how good they are in practice.</p> <p>Any advice, horror stories, etc. would be greatly appreciated!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/s992\"> /u/s992 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.red",
