<p>It was impossible to ignore the shift in mood, the supporters singing the name of their charismatic Portuguese head coach, parachuted in to solve a myriad issues but chiefly the miserable results and the leaky defence. Determined to immerse himself in the local culture, he and his staff spent Christmas Day enjoying a traditional lunch at a local pub a few miles out of town. Then there is the friction between those who pay their money in the stands and those who spend it in the boardroom. It has been an unhappy picture for a while, the players presumably thinking of an appropriate escape route. The problem for Ruben Amorim is that Vítor Pereira was the manager who triumphed here.</p><p>For Manchester United, it is now four defeats in their past five matches. United, who drop a place to 14th, are eight points above the relegation zone, 11 from the top four, which is badly fading from view, having taken seven points from a possible 21 since Amorim replaced Erik ten Hag.

<p>Over the holidays, this column will explore next year’s urgent issues. Today we look at the crisis in western democracy, Donald Trump’s victory and the role played by digital media</p><p>In November 2020, shortly after Donald&nbsp;Trump’s defeat&nbsp;in the US presidential election, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/11/why-obama-fears-for-our-democracy/617087/">Barack Obama</a> observed that America risked entering “an&nbsp;epistemological crisis”. The prospect of Mr&nbsp;Trump’s return to the White House in January validates his predecessor’s premonition.</p><p>Mr Obama was talking about media fragmentation and polarisation: different segments of society existing in discrete information spaces; arguments no longer drawn from a common reservoir of facts; no shared reality, no foundation of truth. “Then by definition the&nbsp;marketplace of ideas doesn’t work,” he said. “And&nbsp;by definition our democracy doesn’t work.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.c

Nicky Henderson, his trainer, was teary, the punters who sent him off favourite were jubilant and Nico de Boinville, the winner’s jockey, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=431922103326038">was rounding on the critics</a>. “It was definitely worth the wait,” he told an ITV racing reporter shortly after their handing only a second career defeat to the excellent mare, Lossiemouth. “And one more thing. Paddy Brennan, you can shove that where the sun don’t shine.”</p><p>It was, perhaps, a little unnecessary in what is, after all, a game of opinions, and his former weighing-room colleague’s pre-race view that Lossiemouth would emerge victorious was clearly shared by many, as she set off at 11-8.

Gilbert Jessop, David Hookes, Sanath Jayasuriya, Rishabh Pant, most of England’s current lineup – plenty have had their shot. It’s not that nobody has ever played a scoop shot to Jasprit Bumrah in a Test – ask Joe Root, who soon found it didn’t work out so well.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/dec/26/australia-india-
