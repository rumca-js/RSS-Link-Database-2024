<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>The last time I pirated a show was Breaking Bad in 2012. Then life moved along and started experimenting with Netflix and YouTube premium. Later the prices of the subscription started mounting. Also, my favourite shows or the movie I want to watch was on different streaming platforms. Netflix keep me logging out because I can&#39;t signin more than 4 devices. This made me frustrated. I started thinking the old ways was the best ways. I decided to start downloading my movies and shows (with VPN). I loved it. High resolution picture quality and full control over the material. I have it in my hard disk. It made me connect with my younger self. I think I won&#39;t go back. Let me know your experience with moving back to piracy. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/sujeet5216"> /u/sujeet5216 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1hmlce3/after_12_years_i_started_pirating_again_

I have a file that is something like 150 GB of a show I want to download, but it is on Dropbox, so I am wondering if like the torrent it would flag on my Internet Provider? I know about Binding for torrents now and have protonvpn, but because this is about Dropbox, I wasn&#39;t sure if it is safe right now to try and download it or if I should look into an alternative method? I imagine that even with protonvpn my provider will go &quot;hmm, what is this large file he&#39;s downloading?&quot;, or was it specifically because I did a torrent that they saw it and emailed me? For reference they knew the show title, and it is Verison.

Help? also worth noting this didnt happen the first time, where the download link took me to something called a windows installer package which i thought looked odd. then I couldnt figure out how to run the thing, I put it in bitcomet but it didnt run it just got converted to a bitcomet file. Then I deleted it. tried redownloading it but I think its just the wrong file. man, I just wanna play silent hill 2.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Junksonder"> /u/Junksonder </
