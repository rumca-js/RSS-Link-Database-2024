<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>What language have you found the most exploitable vulnerabilities in over your career?</p> <p>Backstory on them is welcome. Did you find a no click vuln that would have given the attacker admin level access? I would absolutely love to hear about it </p> <p>Both developer created ones and ones existing in the language or various functions/processes in language itself. </p> <p>Is there one that you instantly remember or think of like, oh yeah that&#39;s Javascript for sure. Or, yeah by far python, mostly due to developer error. Maybe you have experience as a high level developer and have seen stuff so dumb it made you wanna cry. </p> <p>Tell me all of the vulnerability things. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Junior-Bear-6955"> /u/Junior-Bear-6955 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1hmfkec/what_programming_language_consistently_had_the/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <spa
