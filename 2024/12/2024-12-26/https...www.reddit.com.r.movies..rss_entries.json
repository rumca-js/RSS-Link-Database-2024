Where you had no expectations or generally thought the movie won\u2019t be good but you were genuinely surprised how good it actually turned out. For me that\u2019s definitely The war of the rohirrim. As a huge Lotr Fan I was really skeptical. And also which movie did disappoint you the most? What movie did not live up to the hype it had.

At most, movies might have opening or closing narration, but I cant think of many other movies throughout the history of film that is fully narrated for the length of the film. And even more rare is for the narration to be done by the main character, usually its a disembodied storyteller. Deadpool is the last one I could remember but his narration makes sense as he is made to be a fourth-wall breaker. Even at that he didn&#39;t narrate his movies the whole way through.</p> <p>Can you imagine any modern movie today with full narration in the vein of A Christmas Story?
