<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Just last night, I finished reading the manga series <em>Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou</em> (also known as the <em>Yokohama Shopping Log</em> in English). </p> <p>These series (which I’ll refer to as YKK from now on), have been seen as a part of many different genres, from Solarpunk to cozy fiction, to post-apocalyptic. And they are honestly all of them. It is a phenomenal read, mostly because of how it is able to convey so many emotions of nostalgia, sadness, coziness and calmness together.</p> <p>The story takes place in Japan, sometime in the distant (or maybe closer, given current global events) future: climate change has rampaged the Earth, sea levels are rising more and more each year, and as it seems, the usual world order has, for the most part, faltered. Our main character is Alpha Hatsuseno (or just Alpha), a sentient android girl, who runs a small café in some isolated region in the flooded Miura Peninsula near Yokohama. The manga tells of her e

## I learned *literally* today that the 1947 movie 'Miracle on 34th Street' had an accompanying novella. It's bad.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Earlier today, I was researching one of my all-time favourite Christmas movies: <strong>Miracle on 34th Street</strong>, released in 1947. I found out that, as well as the well-known remake in 1994, there were also three television adaptations over the decades. </p> <p>And there was a novella. </p> <p>The man who came up with the original story for this movie, Valentine Davies, didn&#39;t write the screenplay. He offered it to his friend, director George Seaton, who sold the idea to 20th Century Fox, and who wrote the screenplay. But Davies still had &quot;Story By&quot; credit in the movie. </p> <p>The studio decided to get a book published, to coincide with the movie&#39;s release. They put Davies in touch with a friendly publisher (Harcourt Brace &amp; Company), who worked with Davies to get it written and printed. </p> <p>It&#39;s only a short novella, about 23,000 words. </p> <p>I bought it as an e-book today, and read it almost in a single sitt

Maybe there were plans to adapt said book (like Delirium by Lauren Oliver) but they were canceled, leaving readers longing for more after seeing the pilot. Do you think it would be possible for fans to create more or less independent visual adaptations of a book, using generative AI? Like imagine you keep giving prompts to the AI of every book scene and then voice it over, would it be possible to get a satisfying result?</p> <p>What do you guys think?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I was wondering if anyone has any suggestions for software for managing your book collections? </p> <p>Like most people on this sub, I&#39;ve not got <em>a lot</em> of books. Between my wife&#39;s and my grown up book collection and the kids&#39; sprawling collection of children&#39;s books, there are a lot of books all over our house. And not only are they in great quantity, but they&#39;re also located in lots of different places- some on the main bookshelves in our lounge, some in each bedroom, some in the study, some packed away in longer term storage. </p> <p>Frankly, it&#39;s impossible to keep track of.</p> <p>I&#39;ve looked idly at library software, but most of it is targeted at real libraries and is a) overkill with lending and payment features and the like, and b) expensive. I don&#39;t mind paying for software, but not institutional prices! </p> <p>All I really need is something that will let me scan barcodes and tag a location for each b

And before the end of the year I&#39;m suggesting we play a little game.</p> <p>The game consists of trying to guess the name of a book based on a written <strong>tagline</strong> or <strong>logline</strong>.</p> <p>Your answer must contain the name of the book that tagline reminded you of and then a tagline of your own. There are no correct or wrong answers. But try not to add names or be too precise; let the text be as vague as possible. It can be a book you read this year, or a book that stuck with you ever since — a book you disliked, even.</p> <p>As I&#39;m starting this, I&#39;ll write 2 examples.</p> <p>1- A girl lost her best friend and to discover the truth, she starts a new life in another city.</p> <p>2- After a plane crash, the survivors struggled to survive while learning to cooperate with one another.</p> <p>I hope we

He acts like he cares so much about everyone else, but he sees how bad they are all hurt by his “attempt” and his self harm yet makes absolutely zero effort to solve anything.

Weeks go by and he has friends he meets in this prison, there’s a bully that is secretly working for the school to keep kids “in check”, and eventually this boy and a girl he meets and falls for (she’s the only “different” one, or she at least knows this whole thing is messed up) they run and escape, hiding and sleeping in a gas station or something, trying to make it to Canada. </p> <p>I read this book and loved it, but I can’t remember the name for the life of me.
