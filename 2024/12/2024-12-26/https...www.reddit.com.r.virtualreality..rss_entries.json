I&#39;ve been looking to get into VR for a long time now (years), and it feels like these days the conversation is absolutely dominated by the Quest 3 with the occasional mention of the PSVR 2, unless you start looking at Bigscreen/Varjo/etc. territory. I know other companies can&#39;t subsidize like Meta does, but I just wish there were more choices. I tried a Quest 3 in Best Buy and I wasn&#39;t extremely impressed. The image felt very flat and lifeless which I know is a common complaint with it, I&#39;ve tried some others in the past (I don&#39;t remember which ones, they were like corporate demos or whatever) and those honestly just blew me away and felt so <em>real</em> in a way the Quest didn&#39;t. I don&#39;t have a lot of space near my PC for a wired headset, but would something like a PSVR2 or a used Vive/Index still make sense assuming I could make room to use it? I have a 3080 so that could work. I mostly want to play Beat Saber",

But could i get just a ps move settup with more than 3 tracking points set up? Since price compared to what i get i suppose is ok. I could get 4 cameras and 9 controllers for about $200 and just want it as a temporarry solution and multi point tracking if possible. I also know about the models that people use to mod the controllers to be more comfoetable to wear. Later on my plan is to run full slime with lucidbvr gloves too. All this will be paired up with a pico 4 running over to pc with virtual desktop streamer. But i wonder if this would be a good deal if its possible with multi points rather than just hips and feet. &quot;Not that i need more but if i can id do it. Pluss cameras and controllers they dont want to sell seperate.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/SiccsideProductions",

Not great, but alright. However, it didnt WORK smoothly at all. So many black screens, screen stretching, image twitching, etc etc yall get the point. The problem i mainly have right now is that whenever i join the link lobby or whatever its called it is BLURRY as hell and pixelated. No, my lenses are not dirty, its an image issue. It looks like an incredibly compressed image. After messing around with settings, it suddenly goes back to normal AT RANDOM. i dont know how. But even so, (il",
