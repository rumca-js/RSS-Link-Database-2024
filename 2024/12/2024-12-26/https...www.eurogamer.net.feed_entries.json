The UE5-powered action epic sold millions of copies when it launched earlier this year, impressing with its fast gameplay and sophisticated visuals. However, its configuration on PS5 left something to be desired, employing bizarre frame-rate locks and frame generation with a 30fps base frame-rate. Developer Game Science has addressed at least some of those issues as of the latest patch - and the studio has also added <a data-keyword=\"true\" href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro\">PS5 Pro</a> support, using PSSR to improve image quality for Pro players. So is the console version finally in reasonable shape? And should we expect any issues from the Pro upgrade?</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-gets-a-ps5",

I can't tell where this fear came from. I can't even tell you what my child self thought it was - the exact creature was boringly undefined, labelled simply as 'Very Bad' (and it certainly didn't help that my Dad kept one of his old wetsuits hanging from the rafters like a piece of eternally damp shedded skin).</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/games-of-2024-grunn-was-the-best-vehicle-for-reliving-childhood-fears\">Read more</a></p>",
