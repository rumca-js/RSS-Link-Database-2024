Experts suggest that thunderstorms could interfere with measurements by amplifying particle showers in the atmosphere, leading to overestimated gamma ray energy levels. A study by Ashot Chilingarian and Mary Zazyan highlighted how thunderstorms' electric fields could enhance these showers, raising concerns that LHAASO's observations might be skewed. While LHAASO claims that weather conditions are monitored, the lack of disclosed weather data has led to calls for greater transparency",

Through ancient genome sequencing and strontium isotope studies, this work strengthens linguistic theories and challenges alternative migration models",
