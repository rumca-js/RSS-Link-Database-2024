<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello, so far I&#39;ve been only using scripts and tools made by others. Now I want to build my own customized tools like RATs, InfoStealers, Wireless attack tools etc. Specifically I intend to build my own RAT one day but before that I want to explore and understand the process of making malwares.</p> <p>Please help me with necessary resources or courses I should look into. Free courses will be much appreciated as I am a student right now. </p> <p>(I have prior programming knowledge in JavaScript, Go and Python) </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/mostaqim77"> /u/mostaqim77 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking_Tutorials/comments/1hmeayl/exploit_development_tutorials_or_courses/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking_Tutorials/comments/1hmeayl/exploit_development_tutorials_or_courses/">[comments]</a></span>
