Here are the finest shows to catch up on now</p><p>The premise sells itself: a thirtysomething woman is transported to a parallel life each time she orgasms. But, actually, this lends itself surprisingly well to digging deep into millennial frustrations, anxiety and ennui. Zoe Lister-Jones plays Mae Cannon, a New York art curator who feels stuck in a rut with her life \u2013 specifically with her longterm husband. When she cheats with another man, she wakes up in a new life where she married him, and so the cycle begins, with each new relationship forcing Mae to re-examine her identity and ideals. Does she want, or get, her original life back? No spoilers here, but without ever zapping the smart, sharp comedy that carries it through, this introspection is relatable for many. <em>Watch it on ITVX</em></p> <a href=\"https://www.theguar",

It\u2019s one for fans of the genre only</p><p>The easiest way to describe The Road Trip would be to call it the TV equivalent of an airport novel. Perhaps that is because it is. Beth O\u2019Leary has long kept the WH Smith industrial complex alive, with bestselling novels including The Flatshare, which sold more than 1m copies. That book was adapted into a six-part TV series in 2022, and followed two roommates thrust together by the fact that they rented the same bed \u2013 cleverly twisting the hellscape that is the London rental market into the stuff of a fluffy romcom. This one follows Dylan and Addie, a pair of exes thrust together by the fact that they have to use the same method of transport to get to a wedding 1,000 miles away. Like a rat, a potential love affair is never more than 6ft away in O\u2019Leary\u2019s world.</p><p>This time, our star-crossed, claustrophobic pairing are Dylan and ",
