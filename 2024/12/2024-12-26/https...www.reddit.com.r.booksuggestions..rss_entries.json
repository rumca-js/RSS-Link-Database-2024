Long back I red the 1st book of the red queen series and was obsessed over the twists, but I got exams and paused reading for a while but idk what happened after that I was unable to bring back the interest I once had even though I tried to read the 2nd book I ended up dnfing it. Recently I have been on a slump. I usually read fantasy books and I came across a video talking about the ending of the red queen series and how amazing it was. So should I try to start reading from the 2nd book or just go for some other series. If some other series. I&#39;d like to have recs. As I said I read fantasy. I like the folk of air series, acotar, these hollow vows, legendborn series, the shadow between us duology, once upon a broken heart. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/BlueBerrix\"> /u/BlueBerrix </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comme",

I also love Flannery O\u2019Connor, and I think the ASOIAF books are fun. I was most recently trying to read Absalom Absalom but it\u2019s tough to stick with and not get lost as I\u2019m reading while I doze off, so I need a book that isn\u2019t challengingly avant-garde or complex in structure. I also read three quarters of Blood Meridian but the unrelenting repetition of violence started to wear on me; although I found it fascinating, especially in terms of the Apache Empire. It\u2019s hard to say why I like these books or the link between them except that they paint complicated pictures about human nature and don\u2019t give easy answers. Anything like these, or even something out of left field is welcome. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Educationa",

The book was called Firehorse and combined every single one of those things. The main character was even a girl that shared my name. I still love all those things, with a pinch of romance, but want something obviously more age-appropriate as an adult.
