<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Yes you heard that right. Moving Violations is a comedy from 1985 starring Bill Murray&#39;s brother John Murray, Meg Tilly&#39;s sister Jennifer Tilly and Stacy Keach&#39;s brother James Keach. Any other movies like this starring less famous siblings? </p> <p>I have fond memories of this unjustly forgotten comedy from it endlessly playing on HBO as a kid and I think it still holds up pretty well.</p> <p>It even has Fred Willard, Sally Kellerman and the &quot;Where&#39;s the beef?&quot; Lady</p> <p>Has there ever been a movie starring so many siblings of other actors?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I think between 5-6 years ago (maybe earlier) I watched a Latin American film on a flight and I can’t remember the name of it. It’s starts with an archeologist being interviewed about a recent discovery she’s made, and I think she’s ridiculed by the man journalist. Then it cuts to her in the dessert, and somehow she meets a woman who is addicted to morphine (or something injectable) but the archeologist doesn’t realize she’s addicted until later in the film. I remember scenes of them writing horses together through the desert too. Eventually I think they find this mysterious creature the archeologist has been discovering?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Like, wtf. The premise of &quot;old tired Santa has to get subsidies from US Government to keep his workshop open, and an evil kid hires a bitter bounty hunter to kill him&quot; is clearly a B movie, at best, but my God everyone acted their hearts out in it. Mel Gisbon nailed it as a bitter old Santa who is just tired. &quot;All I have is a loathing for a world that&#39;s forgotten me.&quot; Like, wtf. Marianne Jean-Baptiste was awesome as a supporting character- a Mrs. Claus who wants to remind her husband of why he does what he does. And of course Walton Goggins, as always, delivers. &quot;You never forget the smell of burning flesh and menthols.&quot; Even the kid actors do a fantastic job imo. The scene with the car battery, legitimately felt like the little shit was gonna shock the poor girl. This is clearly a movie where people could have just phoned it in, but gotdamn.

Where you had no expectations or generally thought the movie won’t be good but you were genuinely surprised how good it actually turned out. For me that’s definitely The war of the rohirrim. As a huge Lotr Fan I was really skeptical. And also which movie did disappoint you the most? What movie did not live up to the hype it had. For me thats Dune Part II. I expected a action packed sci-fi movie and got a vouge fashion romance.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>For some strange reason Guy Pearce’s career reminds me of 90s Gary Oldman where he just takes on roles that he likes and yet delivers solid performances. Ive been following Pearce’s career ever since The Count of Monte Cristo and Memento and so him being in discussion for Supporting Actor this year is just cool. His collaborations with John Hillcoat are absolutely brilliant. Although I havent watched The Brutalist yet, I’m very intrigued now and will definitely watch out for it.</p> <p>With this, what is your favorite role of his and favorite film?</p> <p>Just check out some of his filmography which showcases his range: - The Proposition (Him and John Hillcoat are magic) - Rover - Priscilla Queen of the Desert - LA Confidential - Memento - The Count of Monte Cristo - Animal Kingdom - The Time Machine - A Slipping Down Life - The Road - King’s Speech</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ChrisEvansFan">

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I recently saw Unforgiven (1992) and True Grit (2010) and oh my gosh they are two of the best movies i have ever seen in my opinion. I have loved the game Red Dead Redemption 2 for so long that it was about time i watched a film with some of the same essense. I also love neo-western films like No country for old men, Sicario and Hell or highwater. I tried a google search for films like those, but the first movie that got recommended was «the quick and the dead» wich i saw and felt was nothing like the two i mentioned first in terms of pacing, directing, editing and so on. so any tips? Tv shows would be appreciated too! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/NecessaryFlow"> /u/NecessaryFlow </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hmluz3/saw_my_first_two_western_movies_and_now_i_want/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hmluz3/saw_

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I love movies and data, which is I started tracking every movie that I watched as a new years resolution on January 1st, 2019. </p> <p>I rated each movie based on how entertaining it was in context of the genre(s) it was in. Then, I recorded the IMDB scores of each film after I had given my own score, and calculate a difference between my score and the IMDB score.</p> <p>Some movies I watched in movie theaters, a lot I watched on Netflix, or Peacock, Hulu, Amazon, Paramount, YouTube (free with ads), and other streaming services. Before the pandemic, I used to go to the movie theater at least once a week. But now, I go about once a month, at most. </p> <p>In total, I watched 1,113 movies. Looking at the number of movies per year, On average, I watched 185 movies per year. This comes out to about 15 movies per month, or about 1 movies every other day.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>It really is a rare thing in film. At most, movies might have opening or closing narration, but I cant think of many other movies throughout the history of film that is fully narrated for the length of the film. And even more rare is for the narration to be done by the main character, usually its a disembodied storyteller. Deadpool is the last one I could remember but his narration makes sense as he is made to be a fourth-wall breaker. Even at that he didn&#39;t narrate his movies the whole way through.</p> <p>Can you imagine any modern movie today with full narration in the vein of A Christmas Story? The character pretty much narrating what hos thoughts and actions were at the time that he is reciting this story? </p> <p>What are your favorite movies with narration? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ryohazuki224"> /u/ryohazuki224 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’m not a huge fan of Christmas movies in general, but when you’re stuck with watching what the family wants I don’t have much say. We watched A Christmas Story, Die Hard, and Fred Clause in that order today. </p> <p>I forgot how amazing the original Die Hard is, so grounded and claustrophobic. Really like the motif of Ode to Joy reoccurring and thought it was shot amazingly. But Fred Clause really had me laughing for some reason. </p> <p>I have a very odd sense of humor, the entire movie has Looney Tunes sound effects through out that just made me burst out laughing. I thought there were also some really well written jokes. </p> <p>The main story also hit my pretty hard, being an older brother with a more successful younger brother. The feeling of spite and love, I thought Vince Vaughn and Paul Giamatti gave great performances. John Michael Higgens always makes me laugh no matter what he’s in.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I was rather lukewarm on the Brosnan Bond era when I was younger, but over time I&#39;ve come to view him as the best 007 after Connery. Craig embodies the ruthlessness of Bond, but takes him into territory that&#39;s too cold and remorseless. Craig is aided by the fact that the movies he was in were better made and had more relevance to the Bond narrative trajectory—Brosnan&#39;s films, released in that amorphous territory between the fall of the Soviet Union and the retreat into sullen, narcissistic reaction, had no compelling plot or arcs, but nevertheless entertain because the lead possessed the chops to make Bond his own...</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Tarbuckle"> /u/Tarbuckle </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hme0r3/the_brosnan_bond_movies/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hme0r3/the_brosnan_bond_movies/">
