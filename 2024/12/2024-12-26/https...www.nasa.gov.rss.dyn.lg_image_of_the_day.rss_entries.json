This full-power test, during which the engine generates additional thrust, validates the additional power needed for meeting the testing conditions of the aircraft. The X-59 is the centerpiece of NASA\u2019s Quesst mission, which aims to overcome a major barrier to supersonic flight over land by reducing the noise of sonic booms.",
