There are no correct or wrong answers. But try not to add names or be too precise; let the text be as vague as possible. It can be a book you read this year, or a book that stuck with you ever since \u2014 a book you disliked, even.</p> <p>As I&#39;m starting this, I&#39;ll write 2 examples.</p> <p>1- A girl lost her best friend and to discover the truth, she starts a new life in another city.</p> <p>2- After a plane crash, the survivors struggled to survive while learning to cooperate with one another.</p> <p>I hope we",

Nearly every great nonfiction book I\u2019ve read in the past 5 years has this.</p> <p>Sometimes I love it when you can skip chapters of a certain storyline you don\u2019t like.

Everyone around him is putting their entire life on hold to be there for him and he can\u2019t even attempt to get help for his problems. He acts like he cares so much about everyone else, but he sees how bad they are all hurt by his \u201cattempt\u201d and his self harm yet makes absolutely zero effort to solve anything. He refuses to simply try therapy (that they literally set up for him) or even open up to any of his friends/parents at his big age of 40-something. He actually refuses to do anything except sit around and feel sorry for himself. </p> <p>I get he\u2019s had a hard life but for how many years are you going to make Harold, Willem and Andy (etc) prove over and over again that they care about you, for how long are you going to take advantage of their kindness that you say you don\u2019t deserve while continuing to shut them out then mope about being u",
