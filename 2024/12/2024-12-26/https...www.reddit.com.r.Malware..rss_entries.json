The only information that I am aware of about 123Search, is that it\u2019s a spyware browser hijacker, and it originates from <em>Search-123.com</em>.</p> <p>If anyone could inform me more about 123Search, I would appreciate it. Relevant information that I\u2019d like to know about is <em>what did the website look like?</em>, <em>what was the creation date and some of the first instances?</em>, <em>who is the creator?</em> and <em>what other affiliations did 123Search have?</em></p> <p>The last question comes from the fact that there are many other malware like 123Search that serve the same or similar purpose. Due to their similarities, it made me suspect that they all had some sort of relation amongst each other.</p> <p><em>If there is a better subreddit, I\u2019d appreciate it if you can redirect me there.</em>",
