The guilt I am feeling when my parents don&#39;t know I have a same sex partner, but at the same time I felt the need to embrace my true self. The guilt I feel when I know to myself that they are really good parents because they always provide things for us and have sacrificed a lot just for us to have a good education, but in my head, I plan to run away from this family in the time they won&#39;t accept me. The guilt I feel when I feel that my churchmates are genuinely willing to build relationship with me but they do not know that I already do not believe in Christianity anymore. Thinking about how long I have to play this role makes me very sad. Sometimes I wish that one day I wake up bein straight so I won&#39;t have this type of dilemma. I am tired of having a superficial relationship with my family, wearing a mask for so long.</p> </div><",

I was raised as a traditional catholic and although I&#39;ve stopped attending for a multitude of reasons my parents and at least half of my friends still attend. (No Hate to them of, it just wasn&#39;t working for me) But since I&#39;ve stopped going to church I know my parents feel like they&#39;ve failed in some way. They love me so much and just want the best for me and I feel like telling them might hurt them due to their beliefs. Also since I&#39;m attracted to girls and boys there&#39;s a chance I&#39;ll never date a girl, plus I&#39;m moving out pretty far after high school and if I did date girls they wouldn&#39;t have to know unless it got serious. I feel like it&#39;s just best to leave it be for now but I also don&#39;t want to lie. I think most of my friends wouldn&#39;t care but I do have a few who are catholic so idk how telling them would go down. An",
