<p>Optimizing the performance of your .NET applications requires efficient resource management. Memory allocations and deallocations must be performed optimally in performance-critical applications. One of the best strategies to perform resource management in an optimal way in an application is by allocating and deallocating string objects judiciously.</p>



<p>C# provides the string.Split() method to split strings in .NET applications. However, we have a better alternative, the ReadOnlySpan<char>.Split() method, which accomplishes the same thing in a much more efficient way. In this article, weâ€™ll examine the performance drawbacks of the string.Split() method and illustrate how the ReadOnlySpan<
