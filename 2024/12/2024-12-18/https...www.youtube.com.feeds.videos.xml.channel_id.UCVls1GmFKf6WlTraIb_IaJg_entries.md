We are closing the books on the year 2024.  What will 2025 bring us?  Here are five predictions that I have regarding Linux and FOSS in 2025:

0:00 Intro
0:56 Linux desktop marketshare will double again...10%?
2:49 Immutable distros become more prevalent (major distros adopting the model).
3:42 A.I. integration into major desktop environments.
4:49 More corporate influence and less community-oriented.
6:20 Free software and open source will both continue to gain supporters.
