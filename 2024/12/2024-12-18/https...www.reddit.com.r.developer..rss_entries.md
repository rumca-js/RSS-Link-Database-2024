<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi, I have been struggling with getting the API to work at scale, I have tried sending asyncronous requests that did help a lot but still the requests take too long for example with gpt-4o-mini I am getting 5 mins to do 1000 requests, which is too slow for my use case any tips?</p> <p>I want to scale to around 500K requests per hour</p> <p>FYI open to using other APIs to create a solution that works. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/phicreative1997"> /u/phicreative1997 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1hh9pu7/how_to_scale_openai_api_to_millions_of_requests/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1hh9pu7/how_to_scale_openai_api_to_millions_of_requests/">[comments]</a></span>
