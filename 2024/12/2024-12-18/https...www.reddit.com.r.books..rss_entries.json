I\u2019ve just finished book two and found an inconsistency that has irked me. It\u2019s such a small thing that doesn\u2019t mean much in the grand scheme of the series but annoy me it has. </p> <p>So it\u2019s about wizards and through time the amount of wizard blood is diluted and people who have magic are given a % of power they have. In book 1 Hulda is introduced as having 12% and Beth as having 8%. But then in book 2 Hulda now has 8% and Beth has 4%?! Why the change?! I mean it really is a silly change and I don\u2019t know why it bothers me so much, but it does. But on to book 3 all the same.</p> <p>So I was just wondering, what inconsistencies have you come across in your series that may have made you laugh or perhaps bothered you more than it should or was just completely just like \u2018wut\u2019? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/MermaidBeast\"> /u",

It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve read a fantasy series, while I enjoyed it, I was reminded how clunky recaps are at the beginning of each book in a series, especially if the author attempts to do it within the narrative of the story itself, narrated by a character who would have no reason to recap in the context of their story. It is for this reason that I prefer an author prologue or even have it through written, like Tolkien. Given that most authors earn most of their income from residual sales it seems strange, when reading a sequence back to back, that the industry insists on slowing down storytelling to service such short term gains. I\u2019d be interested in anyone\u2019s thoughts. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/patrickwall\"> /u/patrickwall </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hhcch5/scrap_the_recap/\">[link]</a></span> &#3",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I\u2019ve been listening to this on Spotify (I actually had no idea how many books were on there?) because audiobooks have become my favorite way to revisit books I really liked. I think I love it even more the second time.</p> <p>I feel like Virginia Woolf wrote books for people who feel too many things and get overwhelmed by the sheer quantity of feelings (me) and this is my favorite one besides maybe <em>Between the Acts</em>. It took me a while to get used to the <em>no plot just feelings and beautiful words</em> vibes of her books but once I did they became SO fascinating to me.</p> <p>Also, the way the characters kind of exist collectively as a unit made me think about the concept of chakras, and I really like thinking of each of seven main characters as embodying one of the chakras. (In my mind this means Percival as the Root Chakra, Jinny as Sacral, Susan as Solar Plexus, Bernard as heart, Neville as throat, Louis as Third Eye and Rhoda as Crown.)",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;ve noticed that I can read Albert Camus&#39;s works with much more ease compared to Franz Kafka&#39;s. With Camus, the reading feels fluid and straightforward, while Kafka&#39;s writing often feels dense or harder to process. Is it just a stylistic difference, or does it have something to do with their philosophies, themes, or even translation nuances?</p> <p>Ive read the trial, metamorphosis and letter to his father. When compared to the stranger (in which i&#39;m currently reading) I feel as though it&#39;s easier. Initially, I thought it was due to Kafka being german-translated. But Camus is french-translated no? Albert Camus has a more simplistic, straight to the point, descriptive style in my opinion.</p> <p>I&#39;d love to hear others&#39; thoughts on this!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/nasescob4r\"> /u/nasescob4r </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hgp",
