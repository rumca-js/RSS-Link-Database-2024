Going in without knowing anything about the story, I thought this film was going to be a Sly action film going wild on bad guys (which is also a fun time) but when it started progressing, I was surprised when he is actually getting into a long spanning fight with the police. </p> <p>I loved how this film was more reflective and character work is done so smoothly through dialogues and flashbacks. A soldier isolated and ostracized by society riddled with PTSD getting pushed around with no limits. I am not saying he is not at fault too but the first blood was not shed by him. A troubled man getting troubled further. </p> <p>That monologue at the end of the film was just absolutely fantastic and heartbreaking. It also puts into perspective the mental anguish of the character in broad strokes. Overall, First Blood is a triumphant film in all the right ways</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www",
