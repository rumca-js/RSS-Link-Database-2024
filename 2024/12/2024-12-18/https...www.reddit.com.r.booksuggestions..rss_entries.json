I\u2019ve been fascinated to notice how very often I can\u2019t keep up with the new opportunities and degrees of freedom that I win for myself, or that life offers, and how I tend to get confused and uncomfortable and end up sabotaging these opportunities.</p> <p>So I\u2019d be interested in reading a book where a character shows signs of that - having ambition yet lagging to act on it because of learned helplessness. The empowerment can come from simply growing up out of an abusive family, moving countries, magic if you will. </p> <p>Bonus points if there\u2019s progress and we see into their self-talk/what they rely on to overcome it. Even more bonus points if it\u2019s realism.</p> <p>To add some context, I\u2019ve been discussing this with someone and it looks like a lot of books have the premise but fail to actua",

Something that will make me appreciate life. Not sure if all of this makes sense.</p> <p>A little bit of context about me - i am not much of a reader at all. I am new to this thing and I am thinking of making reading books a habit. I am more of a visualiser.

On occasion, I get suggestions on Instagram about spicy book series, but they&#39;re always slightly not for me. It&#39;s like an alpha wolf picking you for the pack? I&#39;m sure it&#39;s steamy, but the fantasy wolf part doesn&#39;t tickle my fancy. But these suggestions I see have me interested in reading these types of things again. </p> <p>There&#39;s that scene in Miller&#39;s Girl. Like midway through the movie. He makes her read a few lines from a book while things happen. THAT was great and I&#39;m looking into that. I guess I don&#39;t really know how to look up smut books? Lol. I also appreciate a good story, not just straight smut. But I also don&#39;t want it to be overtly smut.</p> <p>Any suggestions? \ud83d\ude05</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/cakeismyliife\"> /u/cakeismyliife </a> <br/> <span><a href",

Basically I want to feel what I felt while reading books like The Hunger Games, Harry Potter, and Maze Runner. </p> <p>Two genres/themes I&#39;ve been curious about lately mainly because I rarely ever see anyone talk about, has been nordic and pirate inspired fantasy books. I did try searching some up but I don&#39;t know...none of the plots seem worth investing my time in. So if anyone has any recommendations of a good trilogy or duology that&#39;s gonna make me feel things and cry/laugh my eyes out for the characters and is a nordic or pirate inspired story please let me know \ud83d\ude4f</p> <p>Another thing worth mentioning, I am still in the beginner phase of trying to get back to reading so committing to really long books or series is really difficult.

The more dramatic the story--genius! war! triumph of the human spirit!--the better. Lively nonfiction, or biographical novels would be perfect.
