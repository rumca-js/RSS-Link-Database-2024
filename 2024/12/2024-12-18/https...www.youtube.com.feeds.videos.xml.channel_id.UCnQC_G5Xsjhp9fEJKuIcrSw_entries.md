Ben discusses Canadian politician Pierre Poilievre, who will likely be Canada‚Äôs next Prime Minister. He is a man of the people who wants to see his people live the Canadian dream but knows the government has failed them. Ben talks about how when the Canadian government intervenes, families wither and die because when the government helps, the entitlement remains, but the duties disappear. The dream can only be accomplished by families allowed to live free, to keep their property, and to live without the heavy hand of government dictating every aspect of how they raise their children.
