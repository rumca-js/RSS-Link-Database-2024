The update I found only worked for Tenoke release, so I downloaded that instead. </p> <p>The update works fine, other than 1 problem. I now get less than half of the frames I used to get, even with identical settings to what I had on the other release. I was at ~210 before with my 4080S, now i&#39;m at ~90. When I first launched the game, Path Tracing was enabled and my frames were around ~15. </p> <p>My GPU utilization is also down, from ~90% to ~60%, which I think is the bulk of the problem.
