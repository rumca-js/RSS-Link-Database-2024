<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>my grandfather generally likes horror movies. he&#39;s not a diehard horror fan like me or my mom but he likes them fine. he just generally prefers horror movies from the past century, although he does like hereditary and the witch. however, one genre that he absolutely cannot stand is zombie movies. he claims that it&#39;s just the same thing over and over and over again with very little different. </p> <p>a few years ago, at my suggestion, he watched danny boyle&#39;s 28 days later, one of my top 5 favorite zombie movies. he went in with pretty low expectations but he ended up liking it quite a bit. he said that the film offered a unique spin on the zombie formula and that the performances were good. however, he did say that he doesn&#39;t really consider it to be a zombie movie because the virus doesn&#39;t kill people and make them zombies but rather just makes them really angry. </p> <p>he&#39;s still not a zombie movie fan but he can at least s

## First Blood (1982) is stellar

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have to preface this first. Going in without knowing anything about the story, I thought this film was going to be a Sly action film going wild on bad guys (which is also a fun time) but when it started progressing, I was surprised when he is actually getting into a long spanning fight with the police. </p> <p>I loved how this film was more reflective and character work is done so smoothly through dialogues and flashbacks. A soldier isolated and ostracized by society riddled with PTSD getting pushed around with no limits. I am not saying he is not at fault too but the first blood was not shed by him. A troubled man getting troubled further. </p> <p>That monologue at the end of the film was just absolutely fantastic and heartbreaking. It also puts into perspective the mental anguish of the character in broad strokes. Overall, First Blood is a triumphant film in all the right ways</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>In my opinion Sergio Leone has made several all-time great movies especially Once Upon a Time in the West and Once Upon a Time in America but to me The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly is his masterpiece. Most people recognize it as a really fun and cool classic western which I certainly is but I want to write about what it makes it transcend into a truly artistic masterpiece that most people probably miss. I think it is a lot more complex, creative and emotional than it seems at first glance.</p> <p>First thing is the film has a strong message and theme about morality. On the surface it is a deconstruction of a classic western with the clear cut hero and villain. The hero of a standard Hollywood western is morally upright and does the right thing for the benefit of others. Of course in Leone&#39;s westerns every character is greedy and at best morally grey. However, I think this message is already clear in the first two films of the dollars trilogy and L

He was a staple in my household and one of the first movie stars I admired. But for some reason my early mind couldn’t come to accept his early films. </p> <p>I saw numerous times the vhs boxes for The Burbs and Joe vs the Volcano at the rental store and always created in my head the reasons these weren’t movies for me. I think it was chaos on the covers. I just got a sense they weren’t made for me at that age and I wouldn’t appreciate them. And in a way I was right and in a way I’m beyond glad I waited to age up before I watched them for the first time. </p> <p>You are never surprised watching early hanks movies that he became what he did but at times your disappointed that beyond snl appearances that he focused on dramas.

The movie made me enjoy just being an audience member to someone proving their point via Ted Talk for 2/3 of the movie. Like I can probably rewatch this movie more than once or have it playing on the background at some point and appreciate the writing and execution.</p> <p>Other movies that come to mind would probably be The Hateful Eight.
