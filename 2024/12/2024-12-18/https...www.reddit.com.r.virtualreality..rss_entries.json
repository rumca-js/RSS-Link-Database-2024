He&#39;s not spent his birthday money for 2+ years, spend very little re pocket money so nice to see him actually want something and he can (just) afford one. I would make up the difference for the Meta Quest 3 if that&#39;s the better purchase. </p> <p>I know (I think) the recommended age is 13+. I plan to monitor and limit his use. I&#39;m also likely to be using it. </p> <p>Due to age, he won&#39;t be playing Zombie games or overly inappropriate ones. He loves fortnite so I don&#39;t have an issue with 1st person shooter (within reason). </p> <p>I&#39;d rather not get tied down to hefty subscription fees.",
