## When did it happen, that online games are not about fun but doing daily quests, unlocking skins, farming ingame currency or progressing in the battle pass?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I play almost exclusively the ARAM mode. The other MoBAs are very serious and toxic so it&#39;s nice to have a more casual place for the fun times. It&#39;s not rare to see the whole team saying gg after a match and even losing matches commonly have people honestly saying gg. I think ARAM might be more popular than the normal matches, at least judging by the short queues in ARAM.</p> <p>ARAM gives everyone 3 hero choices so the draft has surprisingly much depth for creating interesting team comps. It even occasionally blesses the players with a possibility to have 3 or even 4 of the same hero in a team which makes memorable matches. </p> <p>If you&#39;ve played other MoBAs and gotten tired of the toxicity, tryharding and snowballing with no possibility to recover, you should give HoTS a try. It&#39;s also a more welcoming place to start with the genre. Not a great game if you&#39;re planning to play competitively. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; subm

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>What’s, in your opinion, the sequels that completely knocked it out of the park compared to its predecessor? It can be anything from gameplay, storytelling, graphics. </p> <p>For me it’s probably The Witcher 2 and Mass Effect 2. Their predecessors were great games in terms of storytelling but everything else… was a product of their time for sure. The sequels took everything to the next level. Third installments in the series were also amazing but they didn’t hit as hard compared to the stark contrast between 1 and 2.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Nomaaaad"> /u/Nomaaaad </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1hgv3ar/largest_leap_in_quality_for_a_sequel/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1hgv3ar/largest_leap_in_quality_for_a_sequel/">[comments]</a></span>
