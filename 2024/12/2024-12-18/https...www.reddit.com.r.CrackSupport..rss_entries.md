<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi. My Xbox 360 controller won&#39;t work with the game. I can feel the vibration on the controller but the controls won&#39;t respond and I would still see action icons for keyboard keys only. I tried reinstalling the controller drivers and reconnecting it. It works with other games like Marvel&#39;s Spider-man. Is there a solution for this issue?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/nobody01810"> /u/nobody01810 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CrackSupport/comments/1hgx6ze/xbox_360_controller_wont_work_with_fitgirls_until/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CrackSupport/comments/1hgx6ze/xbox_360_controller_wont_work_with_fitgirls_until/">[comments]</a></span>

## AC Unity on PC keeps freezing

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’m replaying AC Unity on PC and I have an issue where my game keeps freezing after I assassinate Rioulle (Rouille? Don’t remember how to spell it). I get through the cut scenes where you see his memories but after that my game freezes when trying to come back to Arno. Every single time it freezes at that moment. I checked my drivers and stuff they’re all up to date, my specs are more than enough to run AC Unity so I just don’t see how it’s my PC’s issue. Does anyone know how to fix this?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Leading_Corner_7790"> /u/Leading_Corner_7790 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CrackSupport/comments/1hgvvxz/ac_unity_on_pc_keeps_freezing/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CrackSupport/comments/1hgvvxz/ac_unity_on_pc_keeps_freezing/">[comments]</a></span>

## Is there a way to play Eldin Ring with the messaging system? I don't care about the co-op or writing messages, all I want to do is read amusing messages or messages that will help me uncover hidden walls. Maybe there's a mod that adds messages near hidden walls and areas?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>For some context, I got the game off steamrip originally, the day it became available. After a week or so of playing, I found out there was a day 1 patch that added a path tracing setting, so I tried to update the game. The update I found only worked for Tenoke release, so I downloaded that instead. </p> <p>The update works fine, other than 1 problem. I now get less than half of the frames I used to get, even with identical settings to what I had on the other release. I was at ~210 before with my 4080S, now i&#39;m at ~90. When I first launched the game, Path Tracing was enabled and my frames were around ~15. </p> <p>My GPU utilization is also down, from ~90% to ~60%, which I think is the bulk of the problem. I&#39;m guessing there&#39;s some settings file where I can tell it to use my GPU more? Just not sure what i&#39;m looking for.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/JenNettles"> /u/JenNettles </a
