<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi Everyone,</p> <p>I wanted to figure out some of the difference in a lot of the default settings of the infill patterns as there isn&#39;t a ton of clear information on there. Note this is not a comparison of technical structural integrity and which one is the strongest under what kinds of loads. This is simply a comparison of what each infill pattern does to your print times and the amount of filament it uses compared to the general support it provides.</p> <p>TLDR at the bottom.</p> <p>For this test I did each pattern on two models, the first was a large plain cube that used as much of the print bed as possible and wanted as much infill as possible. That will be the first set of columns that you set. The second was that same cube but almost completely flattened down to allow for very little infill and has more of a horizontal approach to the print.</p> <p>I use Rectilinear as my default control for number comparisons below the table as that what
