<p>The US Departments of Commerce, Defense, and Justice have all launched their own investigations into TP-Link, whose ubiquitous routers are among the top sellers on Amazon and have made their way into roughly 65 percent of US homes and small businesses. TP-Link devices are also used by the Department of Defense and other government agencies.</p>



<p>What’s so bad about TP-Link routers? Well, they come with security flaws and have been linked to cyberattacks in the

<p>Rumors have been circulating for some time that Elon Musk wants to create his own email service, one that would be a direct competitor to the world-popular Gmail. Musk has apparently confirmed such plans now, but concrete details about features and appearance are still missing.</p>



<p>Musk published a <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1868615974955737140">short message</a> on X (formerly Twitter): “That’s exactly what we are going to do.” This was in response to a <a href="https://x.com/rpoo/status/1868504033893531776">comment</a> from one user who had written the following:</p>

<p>A virtual private network service, aka a VPN, is one of the best tools you can use to boost your online privacy and security. It encrypts your traffic and tunnels it through a private server, allowing you to keep your online activities anonymous and hidden from prying eyes.</p>



<p>When looking for a great VPN, you’ll want to consider a few things: First and foremost, does it have a good privacy record; how are its average connection speeds; is it able to unblock streaming services effectively; and finally, does it have a large enough server network for your specific location needs? All of my curated picks below deliver these essentials plus more.</p>



<p><strong>Why you should trust me:</strong> Here at PCWorld we’ve been testing computer hardware, software, and services since the 1980s. For my own part, I’m continually testing all of the major VPNs o

<p>I finally gave in this year and made sure Santa is bringing me a PlayStation VR2 because I absolutely need to play <em>Beat Saber</em>. And when you see this <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-Horizon-MountainTM-Bundle-PSVR2-5/dp/B0C1Q9X8VH/">discounted PS VR2 with <em>Horizon Call of the Mountain</em></a>, you’re going to want one, too. It’s down from $600 to just $349, a whopping 42 percent discount and the best price we’ve ever seen for it.</p>



<p>The PS VR2 is one of the best and most affordable virtual reality headsets out there. It has eye tracking and 3D audio for a realistic gaming experience, and the headset subtly vibrates for haptic feedback. The controllers are comfortable to hold and easy to use, and they come with adaptive triggers and even more haptic feedback for a fun time.</p>



<p>As for visuals, the PS VR2 has OLED panels t

<p>If you’re an avid gamer, the best way to assess your PC’s gaming performance is to use an FPS counter. An FPS counter allows you to see the number of frames per second your computer is rendering. This is good for identifying performance issues like bottlenecking and low frame rates. Luckily, Steam and Nvidia offer FPS counters that are free to use. Let’s get into it.</p>

<p>Football and TV commercials go together like eggs and bacon, but NFL RedZone is — usually, at least — a weekly oasis from the relentless car, beer, and insurance ads. But this past Sunday, the NFL had a little surprise for RedZone streamers. </p>



<p>Instead of seven hours of uninterrupted coverage of NFL teams making their way into scoring position, RedZone viewers found themselves sitting through <a href="https://www.nbcsports.com/nfl/profootballtalk/rumor-mill/news/nfl-sees-fan-backlash-after-showing-commercials-during-sundays-redzone-broadcast" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">four “short” commercial breaks</a>, with the ads presented side-by-side with the gridiron while the football audio was muted.  </p>



<p>NFL fans were unsurprisingly furious, with a few eagle-eyed viewers noting that RedZone host Scott Hanson had replaced his traditio

<p>We expect <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/395115/the-best-usb-c-cables-for-charging-and-transferring-data.html">USB-C cables</a> to simply perform a specified task, to either transfer data or files between two or more devices and give little more thought to the matter, but malicious USB-C cables can do much more than just that.</p>



<p>These cables hide malicious hardware that can intercept data, eavesdrop on phone calls and messages, or in the worst cases, take complete control of your PC or cellphone. The first of these appeared in 2008 — but back then they were very rare and expensive — which meant the average user was largely safeguarded.</p>



<p>Since then, their availability has increased 100-fold and now with both specialist spy retailers selling them as “spy cables” as well as unscrupulous sellers passing them off as legitimate product

Unfortunately, it now appears that this new software has its own problems, with users reporting performance drops of up to 15 percent in games — and testing by Tom’s Hardware shows the issue really does exist.</p>
