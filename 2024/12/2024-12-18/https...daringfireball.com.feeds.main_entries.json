Whether you are a longtime Acorn user (<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2007/09/10/acorn\">like me</a>), or a would-be new user, you should set aside some time to actual read Acorn\u2019s documentation. It\u2019s a full user manual, and it not only describes, in detail, what every feature in the app does and how to use them, but also a vast array of \u201chow-to\u201d tutorials, many of them videos.</p>\n\n<p>In broad strokes, there are two approaches to documenting a serious, professional-level app or software system. One was is a comprehensive functional reference resource. That\u2019s a way that you, the user, can teach yourself how to use a feature, refresh your memory about a feature you haven\u2019t used in a while, or even just check to see if a certain feature even exists. The other is a narrative, storytelling, tutorial approach. That\u2019s not teaching yourself\u2009\u2014\u2009that\u2019s letting an expert teach you, and today that\u2019s often a visual approach through video.</p>\n\n<p>Acorn\u2019s do",

A few of them will be familiar to Apple\nplatform users: subject selection uses machine learning to let\nyou quickly isolate and grab the subject of a picture (there\u2019s\nalso a corresponding \u201cRemove Background\u201d feature to simplify\nthat task) and a Live Text tool allows you to select and copy\ntext within an image.</p>\n\n<p>For me, the star of the show is the fascinating Data Merge, which\nis a bit like Mail Merge for images. If you\u2019ve ever needed to\ncreate the same image several times but with different information\u2009\u2014\u2009nametags, for example, or personalized gift cards\u2009\u2014\u2009this is a\nlife-saver. You open your template image, identify your variables,\nthen hand Acorn a CSV file with the relevant data and it will\nprocess through them, assigning text where needed and even putting\nimages in assigned layers. It\u2019s the kind of wild au",
