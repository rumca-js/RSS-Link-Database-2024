My question is, is this &quot;normal&quot; something that we just deal or is something I am missing? I even thought in trying other distro or even switch GPU to AMD. I have checked with gamemode active and disabled, not using vsync or anything similar, I checked mouse polling rate and its 1000hz right now, I think Nvidia reflex adds more input lag I am not sure. The game the I feel higher input lag is the finals, but I tried cs2 and it also doesn&#39;t seems so direct and raw as windows.
