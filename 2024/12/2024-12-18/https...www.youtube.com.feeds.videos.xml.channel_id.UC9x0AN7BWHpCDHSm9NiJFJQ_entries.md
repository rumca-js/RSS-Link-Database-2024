I created my own cryptocurrency… but I didn’t stop there. I wanted to teach my kids how crypto works, so I had them create their own tokens using Solana. I explained everything—how the blockchain works, what makes crypto valuable, and how markets operate. Then, to take things up a notch, I created a cryptocurrency for their allowance—paying them in tokens when they do their chores. Forget cash… we’re building a family economy on the blockchain. Now it’s up to YOU to decide which coin is best—Addie’s or Chloe’s.
