Which I assumed worked, but when I try to reinstall and use the trial again, I get a notification stating &quot;You have already used your free trial period&quot;. I can only assume that I am missing the removal/resetting of something so I can reuse a trial. </p> <p>Any insight is really, really appreciated because I honestly have no clue.

And let’s not even talk about Shippuden or the fillers that still somehow sucked me in.</p> <p>Now? With just a few clicks, I can download the entire series for free, along with every spinoff, movie, OST, and maybe even a few episodes I accidentally pirated in HD. It’s crazy how things have changed.</p> <p>I’m not saying it’s the right way (support the creators when you can!), but man, the struggle was real back then.
