A recent discovery in Somerset has uncovered a dark chapter of British prehistory. Researchers found 4,000-year-old human remains at Charterhouse Warren, with over 3,000 bone fragments belonging to at least 37 individuals. Evidence shows brutal acts such as scalping, decapitation, evisceration, and signs of cannibalism. Experts suggest these violent events may have been politically or socially motivated, with disease like the plague possibly contributing to this period of unrest

## Do Atoms Really Touch? Science Explains Their Complex Interactions

The question of whether atoms ever truly "touch" depends on overlapping electron clouds rather than physical surfaces. According to Christopher Baird of West Texas A&M University, atomic "touching" is different from everyday physical contact. Atoms lack defined outer surfaces, and their interaction signals the start of physical effects like bonding. Chemical bonds in solids and liquids and gas collisions demonstrate these interactions. High-energy environments, like those created in CERN’s Large Hadron Collider, enable unique atomic behaviors, including elastic and inelastic collisions.

Massive starspots have been observed on the red giant star XX Trianguli, located 630 light-years from Earth. These starspots, larger than the sun's entire surface, make XX Trianguli the "most spotted star in the sky." Researchers from the Leibniz Institute for Astrophysics Potsdam and HUN-REN RCAES discovered that the star's internal magnetic dynamo is chaotic, differing from the sun's predictable cycles. Observations show starspots affecting the star’s brightness and shifting its photocenter by 10% of its radius. The findings offer key insights into stellar magnetic activity and internal dynamics.

Researchers have developed a synthetic antioxidant inspired by Deinococcus radiodurans, a bacterium nicknamed "Conan the Bacterium" for its ability to survive extreme radiation levels. This lab-made compound, called manganese-dependent peptide (MDP), combines manganese ions, phosphate ions, and a peptide from D. radiodurans to neutralise harmful radiation effects. It can endure radiation levels 12,000 times higher than what humans can tolerate. The discovery could have wide applications, including aiding astronauts in prolonged space missions and providing treatment options for acute radiation exposure or metabolic ageing.
