<ul><li>Plans take shape for demanding special general meeting</li><li>‘They have to go. Clubs have just had enough,’ says source</li></ul><p>Bill Sweeney and Tom Ilube could be ousted from the Rugby Football Union early next year with both senior figures facing a motion to be dismissed at a likely special general meeting following a grassroots rebellion.</p><p>Led by the Rugby Football Referees’ Union and backed by the Championship clubs, there is a campaign to sign up enough clubs to force a special general meeting. Plans are being finalised to table a motion calling for both Ilube, the chairman, and Sweeney, the chief executive, to be removed. There is a belief among the rebels that up to 300 clubs may eventually sign up – easily surpassing the required 100 and giving Sweeney 14 days to respond, and 45 days to convene the meeting, most likely in February.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/dec/18/rugby-union-bill-sweeney-tom-ilube-grassroots-rebellion">Continue re

<p>It was a night that Simon Rusk will never forget, the one when he took charge of Southampton for the first time in the wake of Russell Martin’s sacking and carried the fight to Arne Slot and Liverpool. Nobody gave Southampton a prayer – and not only because they had conceded five in defeat in each of their previous two home matches. It has been a season of remorseless struggle for them.</p><p>When Liverpool surged into a two-goal lead before the interval, they were strolling and this Carabao Cup quarter-final looked over. Darwin Núñez scored the first and there was then a first goal of an injury-hit season for Harvey Elliott. Slot watched from up in the press box as he served a touchline suspension for three yellow cards.

<p>Influx of young talent such as Bethell, Atkinson and Carse leaves head coach with revived team but more big choices</p><p>As Brendon McCullum appraised 12 months of fluctuating fortunes for England’s Test side, and looked ahead to a defining year against India and Australia, it was hard not to wonder if a coach known for his gambler’s outlook had let slip a tell.</p><p>The 2-1 series victory here in New Zealand tipped England’s ledger for 2024 to nine Test wins and eight defeats, all while introducing fresh personnel into the setup and dropping the average age of the side by nearly five years. “We’re a better team than we were back then,” said McCullum.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/dec/18/better-now-brendon-mccullum-verdict-england-cricket">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Our favourite animated heroes return, facing arch nemesis Feathers McGraw alongside a malfunctioning AI gnome – it’s an exciting and utterly timeless joy</p><p>Forget Tom Cruise riding his motorbike off a cliff in Mission: Impossible. Wallace and Gromit are on a comfy narrowboat teetering on the edge of the Pontcysyllte aqueduct, having defiantly chucked a bunch of boots at the villain … weapons which, gloriously, have the sole purpose of facilitating a gag about something getting “rebooted”. Nick Park’s immortal creations return in the first Wallace and Gromit adventure for 16 years, a stop-motion animated sequel to the 1993 Oscar-winning short <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/gallery/2023/aug/21/wallace-and-gromit-the-wrong-trousers-30-exhibition-cartoon-museum">The Wrong Trousers</a>.

Usually, the idea of Christmas alone filled me with nightmarish images of isolation and despair. But I had recently lost both my parents. For the past 11 months, my brother and I had been in our parents’ house going through a lifetime of letters, books, clothes, pictures and precious possessions. I&nbsp;needed a break from it all.

<p>In the late 90s, Springer’s talkshow dominated the ratings with some of the most controversial stories ever told. It certainly wasn’t easy to make – but what do its producers think of it now?</p><p>Is there anything The Jerry Springer Show wouldn’t do? The shock talkshow, an arena for people in love triangles to come to blows, also featured incest, white supremacists and a man who married his horse. “I did pitch a guy having an affair,” says Tobias Yoshimura, one of the show’s producers. “He was a necrophiliac. That one got shot down pretty quickly.” Perhaps not so much for matters of taste, as for the practicalities of television and any hopes of a good fight scene. The third guest – the shock reveal of the affair partner – says Yoshimura with a wry smile, “would have to be a cadaver. So that was the step too far.”</p><p>The Jerry Springer Show, which ran from 1991 before finally fizzling out in 2018, started as a mundane daytime talkshow, fronted by Springer, a mild-mannered new

<p>Paddington’s stepdad narrates a visually stunning nature documentary.

There is certainly pleasure to be found in hearing Paddington’s stepdad – if it is OK to call him that – describing how a clever female bear weaves herself a bed out of branches, then piles leaves on top to make an extra-comfortable forest mattress. You half expect a jar of marmalade to pop up to finish off the scene.</p><p>This 10-part docuseries, made up of 30-minute episodes, sadly, is not an animal instalment of Channel 4’s Secret Life of … franchise, in which hidden cameras expose the chillingly ruthless bargains that toddlers can strike when left alone and unsupervised.
