## Google Play Services on GrapheneOS in Work Profile vs. Private Space vs. 2nd Profile?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m new to GrapheneOS and I spent the last 3 hours searching every possible reddit sub and google result and still can&#39;t understand the difference (in terms of privacy) between installing Google Play Services on a 2nd profile vs in a Private Space or Work Profile (which I can&#39;t find anywhere; is there Work Profile on GrapheneOS?)</p> <p>I read so many comments saying &quot;it&#39;s a matter of preference&quot; or &quot;it depends how private you want to be&quot; kind of comments but I couldn&#39;t find a single explanation from a reliable source (not just someone who say &quot;I think&quot; or &quot;My guess is...&quot;) as to what are the privacy implications?</p> <p>If GrapheneOS does a good job in sandboxing Google Play Services, than why would it matter if you just install it on the main profile? Is it exposing you to any information leaked to Google that&#39;s different from Private Spaces/Work Profile and 2nd profile?</p> </div><!--
