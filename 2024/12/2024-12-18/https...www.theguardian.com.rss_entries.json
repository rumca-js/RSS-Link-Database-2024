Plans are being finalised to table a motion calling for both Ilube, the chairman, and Sweeney, the chief executive, to be removed. There is a belief among the rebels that up to 300 clubs may eventually sign up \u2013 easily surpassing the required 100 and giving Sweeney 14 days to respond, and 45 days to convene the meeting, most likely in February.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/dec/18/rugby-union-bill-sweeney-tom-ilube-grassroots-rebellion\">Continue re",
