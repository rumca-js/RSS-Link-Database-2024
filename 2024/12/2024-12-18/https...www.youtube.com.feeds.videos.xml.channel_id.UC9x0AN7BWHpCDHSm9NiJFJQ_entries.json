Get 50% off with code nwc50 \u27a1\ufe0f https://ntck.co/dashlanenwc50\n\n\nI created my own cryptocurrency\u2026 but I didn\u2019t stop there. I wanted to teach my kids how crypto works, so I had them create their own tokens using Solana. I explained everything\u2014how the blockchain works, what makes crypto valuable, and how markets operate. Then, to take things up a notch, I created a cryptocurrency for their allowance\u2014paying them in tokens when they do their chores. Forget cash\u2026 we\u2019re building a family economy on the blockchain. Now it\u2019s up to YOU to decide which coin is best\u2014Addie\u2019s or Chloe\u2019s.\n\n\n\n\ud83e\ude99 Vote for your favorite coin:\n\nAddie\u2019s Coin \u27a1\ufe0f https://explorer.solana.com/address/mntDkYeFWQ6GY9HM4Auiorx8PHLmzB4piGVj4CytZye\n\nChloe\u2019s Coin \u27a1\ufe0f https://explorer.solana.com/address/mnt3QWpXmowA8e1iED7P7BvjJyj7xdMEEfurhLNDzQG\n\n\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udcc3\ud83d\udcc3\ud83d\udcc3Guide/Documentation: https://blog.networkchuck.com/posts/create-a-solana-token/\n\n\n\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25Join the NetworkChuck Academy!: https://ntck.co/NCAcademy",
