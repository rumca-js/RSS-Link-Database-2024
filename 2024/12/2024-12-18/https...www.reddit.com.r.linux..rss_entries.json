The DBA roles, isn&#39;t really a DBA position, it&#39;s more Linux work then DBA work and the last few DBAs they hired didn&#39;t last because the refused to work outside of databases. I, on the other hand, have plenty of data analysis/management experience in my 20+ years as a Linux Admin/Engineer. From the get-go, I found that the Linux team really could use my help and started fixing small things at the OS level. When I came on-board, I only had 20 database servers to manage.</p> <p>The contract was up for recompete/re-bid and my company lost the contract. For reasons I&#39;m not privy to, the new company did NOT bring the linux team lead back on-board, in addition to the project manager; but they did bring me back.

The GPU BIOS can&#39;t really pose a direct attack vector, as it can&#39;t really communicate to the outside world. Stuf like the Intel ME or AMD PSP on the other hand is concerning because of it&#39;s widespread access on RAM and the network interfaces.</p> <p>While I was &quot;worrying&quot; about this it came to my mind that the average Linux install must have quite a few proprietary drivers too, ranging from GPU, to wireless cards and so on. </p> <p>My question now would be what else is commonly proprietary on the OS level and how well are they isolated? The scenario for my thoughts is a compromised driver.</p> <p>I&#39;m not looking to discuss if considerations like these are par",

In short, it interprets three fingers on the trackpad as a mouse-down input, and motion with three fingers afterwards for mouse movement. It can be quite handy, as it will save your hand some effort for moving windows around and highlighting text.</p> <p>Here is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Fy6imaiHWE\">an example</a> of three-finger dragging in action on a MacBook.</p> <h2>About the project</h2> <p>Using the structure of <a href=\"https://github.com/marsqing/libinput-three-fi",
