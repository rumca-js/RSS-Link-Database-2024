I\u2019m currently reading through the Kingkiller trilogy (enjoying it so far, but I\u2019ve just recently started) and have the Cradle series on my TBR as well. But I also wanted to ask for specific recommendations for myself, as I find myself hesitant to try new books when I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll like them. There are a few observations I\u2019ve made in regards to what books I enjoyed. Please keep in mind that I\u2019m fairly new to fantasy as an adult.
