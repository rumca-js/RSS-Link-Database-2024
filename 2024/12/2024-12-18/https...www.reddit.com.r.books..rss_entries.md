<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I’m currently reading the Whimbrel House series by Charlie N. Holmberg. I’ve just finished book two and found an inconsistency that has irked me. It’s such a small thing that doesn’t mean much in the grand scheme of the series but annoy me it has. </p> <p>So it’s about wizards and through time the amount of wizard blood is diluted and people who have magic are given a % of power they have. In book 1 Hulda is introduced as having 12% and Beth as having 8%. But then in book 2 Hulda now has 8% and Beth has 4%?! Why the change?! I mean it really is a silly change and I don’t know why it bothers me so much, but it does. But on to book 3 all the same.</p> <p>So I was just wondering, what inconsistencies have you come across in your series that may have made you laugh or perhaps bothered you more than it should or was just completely just like ‘wut’? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/MermaidBeast"> /u

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I recently read The Farseer Trilogy by Robin Hobb. It’s been a while since I’ve read a fantasy series, while I enjoyed it, I was reminded how clunky recaps are at the beginning of each book in a series, especially if the author attempts to do it within the narrative of the story itself, narrated by a character who would have no reason to recap in the context of their story. It is for this reason that I prefer an author prologue or even have it through written, like Tolkien. Given that most authors earn most of their income from residual sales it seems strange, when reading a sequence back to back, that the industry insists on slowing down storytelling to service such short term gains. I’d be interested in anyone’s thoughts. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/patrickwall"> /u/patrickwall </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hhcch5/scrap_the_recap/">[link]</a></span> &#3

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Have you ever read/heard a book quoted and decided to add it to your TBR? I wanted to start reading books that I wouldn’t normally read while I was trying to get out of a rut, and decided to give this a try. This also led me to think I needed to start reading/listening to more of the classics (a lot of the reading I now is in audiobook form). If you’ve done this, what were the books or quotes?</p> <p>A while back, I was watching one of my favorite TV shows and heard the famous quote from Jane Eyre: “If all the world hated you and believed you wicked, while your own conscience approved of you and absolved you from guilt, you would not be without friends.” I decided to read the book (I listened to it as an audiobook).</p> <p>Years ago, a book series I was reading mentioned Watership Down. This was almost a decade ago,but I still think of the quote often. It is now on my TBR list. “All the world will be your enemy, Prince with a Thousand Enemies, and wh

Weird man. Scientology was a huge chunk of her life for it to only get a vague “I slept in celebrity center after I had a fallout with my mom”.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am a huge classics fan, with most of my fav list occupied by them apart from Harry Potter series. Maybe its a personal bias, but I feel the older books had a better connect with the audience (for me personally, most contemporary works rarely give me the <em>feels</em> that classics do, with the exceptions being-HP series and books related to war torn societies)</p> <p>I also believe they continue to inspire and influence the pop culture (both in movies and books) more than contemporary works. Most of the romantic fiction industry to this date (Mills and Boon Harlequin, Indie authors) are directly based on male characterizations inspired by or in many cases outright copies of Heathcliff and Darcy. Emma too has spawned many female characterizations in movies. Multiple storylines have been inspired by ancient Greek and Roman Classics, same with Count of Monte Cristo. Rick Riordan gave a modern twist to ancient greek stories which still are amongst the

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’ve been listening to this on Spotify (I actually had no idea how many books were on there?) because audiobooks have become my favorite way to revisit books I really liked. I think I love it even more the second time.</p> <p>I feel like Virginia Woolf wrote books for people who feel too many things and get overwhelmed by the sheer quantity of feelings (me) and this is my favorite one besides maybe <em>Between the Acts</em>. It took me a while to get used to the <em>no plot just feelings and beautiful words</em> vibes of her books but once I did they became SO fascinating to me.</p> <p>Also, the way the characters kind of exist collectively as a unit made me think about the concept of chakras, and I really like thinking of each of seven main characters as embodying one of the chakras. (In my mind this means Percival as the Root Chakra, Jinny as Sacral, Susan as Solar Plexus, Bernard as heart, Neville as throat, Louis as Third Eye and Rhoda as Crown.)

## I feel that reading Albert Camus is smoother than Kafka.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve noticed that I can read Albert Camus&#39;s works with much more ease compared to Franz Kafka&#39;s. With Camus, the reading feels fluid and straightforward, while Kafka&#39;s writing often feels dense or harder to process. Is it just a stylistic difference, or does it have something to do with their philosophies, themes, or even translation nuances?</p> <p>Ive read the trial, metamorphosis and letter to his father. When compared to the stranger (in which i&#39;m currently reading) I feel as though it&#39;s easier. Initially, I thought it was due to Kafka being german-translated. But Camus is french-translated no? Albert Camus has a more simplistic, straight to the point, descriptive style in my opinion.</p> <p>I&#39;d love to hear others&#39; thoughts on this!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/nasescob4r"> /u/nasescob4r </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hgp
