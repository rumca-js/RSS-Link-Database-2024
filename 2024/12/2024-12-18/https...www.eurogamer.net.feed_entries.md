It&rsquo;s been marketed by the Chinese brand as a &lsquo;zero gravity&rsquo; chair, possibly designed to make you feel as if you&rsquo;re floating in mid-air when in reality you&rsquo;re writing an important email.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-sihoo-doro-s300-review-a-space-age-office-chair">Read more</a></p>

<img src="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/PRO-site_jA0zEXr.png?width=1920&height=1920&fit=bounds&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp" /> <p>When Sony revealed the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PlayStation 5 Pro</a>, it did so in a very different manner to the reveal of PlayStation 4 Pro and PlayStation 5. While lead system architect Mark Cerny was 'master of ceremonies' for the Pro reveal, the debut has a shortlived nine-minute affair - and a good proportion of that run-time celebrated the achievements of the standard PlayStation 5 console. It was a far cry from the detailed presentation given for the reveal of Sony's first 'Pro' console and somewhat bereft of detail compared to the now legendary 'Road to PS5' presentation given by Cerny in March 2020. We were left hungry for more details - and now, they have finally arrived.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-ps5-pro-deep-dive">Read more</a></p>

<img src="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Cerny_OGrCcbG.jpg?width=1920&height=1920&fit=bounds&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp" /> <p>Sony's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PlayStation 5 Pro</a> is a powerful mid-generation upgrade that delivers machine learning upscaling, improved ray tracing and more raw graphics horsepower. We've spent hours testing and discussing its capabilities, but it's always fascinating to see the other side: how it was built and how its software was designed. With that in mind, Digital Foundry's Oliver Mackenzie spoke to PS5 Pro lead system architect Mark Cerny and core technology director at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/insomniac-games">Insomniac Games</a>, Mike Fitzgerald. </p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-sony-ps5-pro-tech-interview-with-mark-cerny-and-mike-fitzgerald">Read more</a></p>
