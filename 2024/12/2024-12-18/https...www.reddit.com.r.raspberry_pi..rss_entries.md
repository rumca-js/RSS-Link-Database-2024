<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’m doing a project where I need a pi running of another pis power to communicate with eachother using I2C, they share a common ground and I am 10000% sure they are wired correctly (SDA and SCL pins) but whatever I do running I2Cdetect -y 1 gives no results, I have tried running this on both of the pis but they won’t detect eachother, I am also sure I have enabled I2C in the config but maybe not one of them as a slave? I’m not sure if this is even completely necessary Please help!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/BitterFudge8510"> /u/BitterFudge8510 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1hhdras/my_pis_wont_talk_to_eachother_over_i2c/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1hhdras/my_pis_wont_talk_to_eachother_over_i2c/">[comments]</a></span>

Im using 4 AA Batteries to run the pico, the LED and the Speaker.</p> <p>The Neopixel LED im using is the 3 WS2812b LEDs in a small ring. Im programming in CurcuitPython.</p> <p>Right now the speaker works perfectly fine but the LEDs doesnt even turn on. I tried everything:</p> <ol> <li>Checked the wiring. The Dataline and the Energylines are working fine. The LED gets 5V.</li> <li>Changed the GPIO Pins multiple times.</li> <li>Tried using the LED without the speaker

## Audio is low quality when playing through Rust.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am using a Raspberry Pi 4 with the newest version of Raspbian installed. The sound plays normally in high quality when directly clicking the sound, playing it with VLC player. But when I try to play the sound in a Rust project, the sound is slowed down, and has a lot of cracking/glitchy noise. I already tested it on different Raspberry PI&#39;s, as well as using different audio frameworks on Rust, changing the sample rate of the audio file, many other things. Has anyone experienced this before and is there a solution to this?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/JohnyWuijtsNL"> /u/JohnyWuijtsNL </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1hgz65a/audio_is_low_quality_when_playing_through_rust/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1hgz65a/audio_is_low_quality_when_playing_through_rust/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I just purchased a Raspberry PI Zero W. This is the first time I have used one and I am struggling to set it up and get it working for Magic Mirror. I get to the npm install and then it starts giving me node errors and EBADENGINE errors. I have tried downloading different versions and using chat gpt to help without any luck.</p> <p>I am hoping someone can help guide me through this so I can get Magic Mirror downloaded.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/EditorOk8204"> /u/EditorOk8204 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1hgv4bv/magic_mirror_with_raspberry_pi_zero_w/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1hgv4bv/magic_mirror_with_raspberry_pi_zero_w/">[comments]</a></span>
