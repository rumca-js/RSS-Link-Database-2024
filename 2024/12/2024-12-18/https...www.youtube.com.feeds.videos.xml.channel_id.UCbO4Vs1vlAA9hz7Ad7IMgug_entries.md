Welcome to the next episode of the GMG Indie Hour! This series focuses on games you may have never even heard of and gives us an inside look at the wider world of independantly published Tabletop Wargames of all genres.

In this episode we're going to keep to our format - One game suggested by Patrons and one game I think needs more HYPE. Patrons selected TRENCH CRUSADE for a live look and as the gaming somalier that I am I paired this with The Last War or a game I think deserves more Hype!

Check out The Last War starter set HERE: https://wargamesatlantic.com/products/the-last-war?srsltid=AfmBOor5WcAOpgkXxMAlKNqNCOmnFYkTRUlMUYByqe384g0S5ulzHYEV
