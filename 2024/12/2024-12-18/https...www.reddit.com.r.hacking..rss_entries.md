<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello fellow redditors,I&#39;m looking for new ideas for my GitHub project.Currently I&#39;m working to make the links be as less suspicious visible as they can,and I&#39;m working on the location to be even more specific and helpful. This is the project: <a href="https://github.com/dedsec1121fk/DedSec">https://github.com/dedsec1121fk/DedSec</a> Inside the program you helped me with,in the project credits and the project code as comment, I will add your GitHub or Reddit account name. I need to expand the possibilities even more. (Not self promotion,I&#39;m a Greek citizen and here,even if you search, not many people care about these things,even the YouTube tutorials in my language are old asf,so I need help.)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/FK_GAMES"> /u/FK_GAMES </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1hh9fbi/help_with_ideas_please/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a h

## I have an old winrar file and I know what the password is supposed to be, but I think I mistyped it when I encrypted it. Can someone walk me through how to tell hashcat what code to use in this regard?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s say my file is named DumbFile.rar</p> <p>Let&#39;s say the password is Johnny1234</p> <p>That&#39;s the same format as the password, including the number of characters, first letter being capital, and there are 4 digits at the end.</p> <p>My belief is that I mistyped and set the password as Johnnny1234 or Johnny12234 or Johnnyq1234 or something like that.</p> <p>I have hashcat-6.2.6. I see mountains of information on it, but I&#39;m unfamiliar with nearly every term being used. The simplest, dumbest question is - how the hell do I run it?</p> <blockquote> <p>To run a Windows console program in mintty or Cygwin/MSYS/MSYS2 sshd, prepend winpty to the command line: </p> </blockquote> <p>^ Might as well ask me to remove a tumor from a cat while it&#39;s running. All of the explanations I see require a great deal of understanding terms that I don&#39;t know.</p> <p>I need to install other software first? Or do I run it in a command prompt? If so
