This includes MLP layers and a small number of attention heads that transfer operand and operator information to predict the correct output.</p> <p>First, we establish our foundational model by selecting an appropriate pre-trained transformer-based language model like GPT, Llama, or Pythia.</p> <p>Next, we define a specific arithmetic task we want to study, such as basic operations (+, -, ×, ÷). We need to make sure that the numbers we work with can be properly tokenized by our model.</p> <p>We need to create a diverse dataset of arithmetic problems that span different operations and number ranges. For example, we should include prompts like “226–68 =” alongside various other calculations.

Maybe by rereading them several times I can internalize them more easily than by reading a book?
