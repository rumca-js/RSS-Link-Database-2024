IGN sat down with director Barry Jenkins, songwriter Lin-Manuel Miranda, and the cast of Mufasa: The Lion King to talk about the impact of the original film, its evolving musical identity, and how the incredibly difficult platformer version of the game for Sega Genesis scarred Taka actor Kelvin Harrison Jr. for life.

Mufasa: The Lion King, reviewed by Robert Daniels. Narrated by Erik Adams.

Moonlight’s Barry Jenkins makes the leap to big budget, popcorn entertainment – and just like the CGI stars of Mufasa, he lands on his feet. This origin story stands alone by pitting familiar characters against new villains, resulting in a photorealistic film that’s driven as much by its storytelling as by its technology. The ungainly structure and self-aware winks at the audience can sometimes distract from Mufasa’s powerful mythmaking. But Jenkins’ knack for eliciting deep emotion and visual wonder remains sharp, especially when bolstered by Aaron Pierre and Kelvin Harrison Jr.’s delightful voice work.

## Is Elden Ring Nightreign Starting a FromSoft Multiverse?

For the first couple of minutes, the trailer for Elden Ring Nightreign is… not exactly predictable, but certainly understandable. It’s Elden Ring like we’ve never seen it before, remixed and reassembled, but still unmistakably a return to The Lands Between. And then… is that The Nameless King from Dark Souls 3?

Who could have guessed that, on the day FromSoft announced a game with battle royale elements, that the thing we’d be obsessing over was the return of a gargantuan bastard from Dark Souls 3? One thing is clear: you can count on FromSoft to continuously surprise us.

Alien: Rogue Incursion reviewed by Travis Northup on PSVR 2, also available on PC.

Alien: Rogue Incursion is a faithful and entertaining stab at bringing Alien to virtual reality. The excellent story, spot-on Alien environments, and creepy Xenomorphs keep the horrifying times going throughout its eight-hour duration – even when repetitive combat, predictable AI, and the odd bug here and there make it clear this is the first attempt that it is. But while there’s plenty of room for this budding series to grow, I can already happily recommend Rogue Incursion as a strong proof of concept to Alien fans and newcomers alike – one that’s left me eagerly awaiting part two.

It's soon revealed that the chimpanzees had been harboring a deadly virus that sends its victims into a furious, murderous rage, and in the days following the initial exposure, the entire population was nearly wiped out due to the resulting homicidal rampage.

Via a leak, Helldivers 2 may be getting a crossover with dormant Sony IP Killzone. An upcoming warbond is reported to feature equipment used by the Helghast, the villains in the Killzone series. Sony of course has taken down all the images of the leak, which says to us that there's some legitimacy to them. In other news, Borderlands 4 may feature a more serious tone compared the previous games in the series. While the franchise may not turn into a super-serious action shooter any time soon, expect less toilet humor and cringey pop culture references. And finally, Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth's director, Naoki Hamaguchi, is asking modders to not make inappropriate modes dor the game's upcoming PC release. You hear that, modders? Wholesome mods only, please.
