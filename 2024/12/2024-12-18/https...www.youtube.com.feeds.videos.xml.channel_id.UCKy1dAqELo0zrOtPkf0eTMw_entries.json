Narrated by Erik Adams.\n\nMoonlight\u2019s Barry Jenkins makes the leap to big budget, popcorn entertainment \u2013 and just like the CGI stars of Mufasa, he lands on his feet. This origin story stands alone by pitting familiar characters against new villains, resulting in a photorealistic film that\u2019s driven as much by its storytelling as by its technology. The ungainly structure and self-aware winks at the audience can sometimes distract from Mufasa\u2019s powerful mythmaking. But Jenkins\u2019 knack for eliciting deep emotion and visual wonder remains sharp, especially when bolstered by Aaron Pierre and Kelvin Harrison Jr.\u2019s delightful voice work.\n\n#MufasaTheLionKing #TheLionKing #IGN",

The excellent story, spot-on Alien environments, and creepy Xenomorphs keep the horrifying times going throughout its eight-hour duration \u2013 even when repetitive combat, predictable AI, and the odd bug here and there make it clear this is the first attempt that it is. But while there\u2019s plenty of room for this budding series to grow, I can already happily recommend Rogue Incursion as a strong proof of concept to Alien fans and newcomers alike \u2013 one that\u2019s left me eagerly awaiting part two.",

        "description": "In today's Daily Fix:\nVia a leak, Helldivers 2 may be getting a crossover with dormant Sony IP Killzone. An upcoming warbond is reported to feature equipment used by the Helghast, the villains in the Killzone series. Sony of course has taken down all the images of the leak, which says to us that there's some legitimacy to them. In other news, Borderlands 4 may feature a more serious tone compared the previous games in the series. While the franchise may not turn into a super-serious action shooter any time soon, expect less toilet humor and cringey pop culture references. And finally, Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth's director, Naoki Hamaguchi, is asking modders to not make inappropriate modes dor the game's upcoming PC release. You hear that, modders? Wholesome mods only, please.",
