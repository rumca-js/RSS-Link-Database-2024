<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>PS5 already owned, no interest in getting a PC. Wanted for an 11 year old. </p> <p>Apologies for asking something that appears to have been asked slightly differently several times... I have done a search and read 100s of posts but am still on the fence as none fully answer my questions. </p> <p>My son, age 11 is keen to buy himself a VR headset. He&#39;s not spent his birthday money for 2+ years, spend very little re pocket money so nice to see him actually want something and he can (just) afford one. I would make up the difference for the Meta Quest 3 if that&#39;s the better purchase. </p> <p>I know (I think) the recommended age is 13+. I plan to monitor and limit his use. I&#39;m also likely to be using it. </p> <p>Due to age, he won&#39;t be playing Zombie games or overly inappropriate ones. He loves fortnite so I don&#39;t have an issue with 1st person shooter (within reason). </p> <p>I&#39;d rather not get tied down to hefty subscription fees.

## Question about Quest 3 vs Other headsets

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’m considering buying the Q3, but during my research people are explaining how the Q3 essentially plays it’s games using a “compressed video data stream”</p> <p>I don’t understand how that’s the case. Is that still the issue even when connecting the Q3 to PC via USB-C directly to the GPU? Is it practically pointless to get a Q3 when wanting to play PCVR games?

I was thinking the standard of just showing them richies plank experience or some Rollercoaster game.

## I find headphones to be less immersive than default Quest speakers

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Of course I love good headphones or IEMs for games like Beat Saber, I&#39;m not talking about the <em>quality</em> of sound. But when it comes to spatial audio, everything I&#39;ve tried so far is too &quot;inside your head&quot; to be convincing in immersive games. The soundstage of most headphones is too narrow, and the ear cups (or earbuds) are a subconscious reminder you&#39;re in a game.</p> <p>If there&#39;s one thing I miss most about selling my Index, it&#39;s those off-ear speakers hovering over your ears.

## How is 360 stereoscopic achieved?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I understand with filmmaking that two eyes are needed to make the 180 VR perspective stereoscopic. But I swore I saw something where it was 360 but also 3D but live action. How is that achieved? Wouldn&#39;t you need a sort of continuous 360 double lenses of stereoscopic imagery? Or is it faked somehow, like it&#39;s really a finite number of stereoscopic perspectives stitched together and if you look closely enough, you can see where the seams of the 3D perspectives don&#39;t really align?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/CyJackX"> /u/CyJackX </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1hhb3sd/how_is_360_stereoscopic_achieved/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1hhb3sd/how_is_360_stereoscopic_achieved/">[comments]</a></span>

I ended up in this place called Sunset Bar, and the moment I walked in, I got hit with flashing lights, loud music, and people talking over each other in groups—like stepping into a real bar where you don’t know anyone.</p> <p>There was even a guy playing the role of a bouncer, asking for IDs and telling me to “enjoy the night” as he let me in. I stood there for a bit feeling awkward—like, who do I talk to?—and that same social anxiety hit me that I’d probably feel at an actual bar alone.</p> <p>Eventually, I sat down at the counter and started chatting with the avatar next to me.
