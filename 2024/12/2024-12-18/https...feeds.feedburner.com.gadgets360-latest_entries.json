        "description": "A recent discovery in Somerset has uncovered a dark chapter of British prehistory. Researchers found 4,000-year-old human remains at Charterhouse Warren, with over 3,000 bone fragments belonging to at least 37 individuals. Evidence shows brutal acts such as scalping, decapitation, evisceration, and signs of cannibalism. Experts suggest these violent events may have been politically or socially motivated, with disease like the plague possibly contributing to this period of unrest",

Short-range radiation is safely captured within the diamond casing, ensuring safety for practical use. Carbon-14 is sourced from graphite blocks in nuclear reactors. The innovative battery could revolutionise low-energy applications like pacemakers, X-ray machines, and deep-sea or space exploration by providing long-lasting, maintenance-free power",

        "description": "The question of whether atoms ever truly \"touch\" depends on overlapping electron clouds rather than physical surfaces. According to Christopher Baird of West Texas A&M University, atomic \"touching\" is different from everyday physical contact. Atoms lack defined outer surfaces, and their interaction signals the start of physical effects like bonding. Chemical bonds in solids and liquids and gas collisions demonstrate these interactions. High-energy environments, like those created in CERN\u2019s Large Hadron Collider, enable unique atomic behaviors, including elastic and inelastic collisions.",

Conducted by researchers at Johns Hopkins University using a high-pressure freezing imaging method, the discovery showed rotund blobs connected by thin tubes within axons. These structures, explained by physical mechanics, may influence the speed of neural signal transmission.",

It can endure radiation levels 12,000 times higher than what humans can tolerate. The discovery could have wide applications, including aiding astronauts in prolonged space missions and providing treatment options for acute radiation exposure or metabolic ageing.",
