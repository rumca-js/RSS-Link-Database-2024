<p>The release Tuesday by OpenAI of OpenA1 o1, its reasoning model, in API, along with three new sets of tools for developers, is a “smart move that keeps [it] in the corporate/enterprise conversation, as so many customers are shifting their focus towards agentic applications over simpler chat-based applications,” an industry analyst said.</p>



<p>Jason Andersen, VP and principal analyst with Moor Insights & Strategies, also described it as “something of a defensive move, since we have seen AWS, Google, and Microsoft releasing API-based multi-model development frameworks such as Bedrock and AI Foundry.”</p>



<p>Some of those frameworks, he said, “do have OpenAI as a potential model target, but

<p>Few languages are as highly esteemed by developers as <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2255250/what-is-rust-safe-fast-and-easy-software-development.html">Rust</a>, which promises robust memory safety without compromising speed. Rust also has a steep learning curve, though, and some of its programming concepts can feel like a barrier to knowing it well.</p>



<p>As an aid to the aspiring Rustaceans, here are four key concepts of the Rustosphere—the kinds of things a more experienced Rust developer might wish they knew from the beginning. Having a grasp on these concepts will give you a head start when you start writing programs with Rust.</p>

<p>There are many stacks on the server side and one of the most longstanding and capable ones is the .NET platform using C#. <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2264488/what-is-the-net-framework-microsofts-answer-to-java.html">.NET is broadly comparable to the Java platform</a>, and over the years, the two have been competitors and mutual influencers. Each draws inspiration from the other. In this article, we’ll develop a simple server-side generated application using C#. We’ll throw in a dash of HTMX for dynamic front-end interactivity without the JavaScript.</p>

<p>One of the coolest things about software development is that you don’t need anyone’s permission to do it. If you need an application for your business or personal use, there isn’t a single thing stopping you from learning to code and writing it yourself. There’s no trade organization or governing body to seek approval from. <br><br>Now, if you want to practice law, or issue drug prescriptions, or even cut hair, you have to get permission from some government entity. But if you want to write the next viral application used by millions, you can just fire up your computer and start building. Nobody is going to stop you.<br><br>And more importantly, no one should stop you.</p>
