<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello guys,</p> <p>I&#39;m curious if there are any good open-source resources for developing honeypots in Windows. I would like to be able to use this to obtain malware samples for a personal project. From an initial google search, it seems like everything that&#39;s out there is either a Linux honeypot solution, a commercial tool, or really old. Are there any decent free resources that could help me develop a honeypot for Windows? Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Throwaway_vks55992"> /u/Throwaway_vks55992 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Malware/comments/1hh5vem/windows_honeypot_for_research/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Malware/comments/1hh5vem/windows_honeypot_for_research/">[comments]</a></span>
