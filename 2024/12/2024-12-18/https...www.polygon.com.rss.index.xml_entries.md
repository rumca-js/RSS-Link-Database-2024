## Digital de-aging has been a shortcut for bad movies, but a Star Trek short proves it can make for great art too

<p class="has-drop-cap has-text-align-none">If you want to make a cinephile cringe, “digital face replacement” is the phrase that pays. “Digital de-aging” and “deepfake” will do the trick, too. While theoretically just the latest addition to the filmmaker’s toolkit, it’s proven to enable some of Hollywood’s ugliest and most cowardly instincts. In an industry already averse to risk and change, digital de-aging and the more dehumanizing practice of outright replacing an unknown actor’s face with a familiar one allows media corporations to lean more than ever on the

Crush 40 musician Johnny Gioeli is suing Sega of America for breach of contract, saying the publisher only has rights to the lyrics, not any other part of the composition.

<p>2024 picked up where its predecessor left off, with one notable exception: more original ideas, fewer franchise movies (although there were still a few standouts). Nations around the globe contributed stellar entries to the genre, with big-budget spectacle and precise low-budget projects alike providing the joys of hard-hitting action. And that’s all without a John Wick, James Bond, or Mission: Impossible in sight.<

<p class="has-drop-cap has-text-align-none">Though the three Sonic the Hedgehog movies have charms of their own, they’ve also clearly benefited from a confluence of lucky breaks in order to reach their rarefied beloved-franchise status. The generally poor track record of previous video game adaptations; the release of the first movie before COVID closed theaters and the second one not long after movie-going started to return to normal; genre fan weariness with the sheer volume of Marvel continuity; the Sonic-nostalgic ’90s kids starting to have kids of their own: All of this has combined to overcome the fact that the Sonic movies tend to be sloppy, motor
