								<p><b>Dungeons and Dragons</b> dropped a surprise playtest document on December 17, and it suggests a heap of minor changes to the Artificer class. There’s nothing explosive inside, and some fans may lament how familiar the Artificer looks overall. However, things <i>have</i> changed – and not always for the better.</p>

								<p>There’s an atmosphere of hope in <strong>Magic: The Gathering's</strong> Modern format right now. A format-warping card, The One Ring, was cast into the fire, and the dominant energy decks were nerfed a little bit more with Amped Raptor copping a ban. While it’s still too early to draw any strong conclusions, so far one deck has seen a significant victory in the post-ban meta: Kethis Combo.</p>
