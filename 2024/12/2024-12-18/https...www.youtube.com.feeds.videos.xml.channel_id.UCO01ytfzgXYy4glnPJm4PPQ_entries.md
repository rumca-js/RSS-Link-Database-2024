Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the Academy Awards put out their shortlist for documentaries. Somehow, the number one documentary of the decade didn't make the list. Also, Joe Biden says that the mysterious so-called drones in the sky are probably not nefarious, but he's not exactly sure. San Francisco, having solved all of its other problems, appoints a "fat acceptance" czar. And Justice Kentanji Brown Jackson goes from being a really bad jurist to an even worse Broadway star.
