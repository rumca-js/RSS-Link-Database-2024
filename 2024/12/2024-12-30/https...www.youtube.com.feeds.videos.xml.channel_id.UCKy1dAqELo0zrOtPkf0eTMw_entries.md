The hit Netflix show Squid Game is back, with Squid Game season 2. In IGN’s Squid Game season 2 review, we discuss how Squid Game finds its second wind by exploring the complex layers of a deadly system. Storytelling continues to be Squid Game’s strongest asset, and a leaner season two helps to focus energy on a more nuanced approach to this expanding fictional Squid Game universe.

Squid Game Season 2 stars Lee Jung-jae, Yim Si-wan, Kang Ha-neul, Park Gyu-young,Park Sung-hoon, Jo Yu-ri, Cho Sang-woo, Yang Dong-geun, Kang Ae-sim, Lee David, Lee Jin-uk, Choi Seung-hyun, Roh Jae-won, Won Ji-an and more! And of course, it wouldn’t be Squid Game without creator and director Hwang Dong-hyuk.

Xbox ended the year extremely strong, dropping three exclusive bangers in a row: STALKER 2, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, and my personal vote for Game of the Year in 2024 and the game that I think is the best Xbox exclusive in years, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. 
So, can Microsoft keep that positive momentum going into 2025? Xbox games in 2025 could be the strongest and most bountiful since at least 2021, when it dropped Forza Horizon 5, Halo Infinite, and Psychonauts 2. Let’s dig into why we're optimistic.
