<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I host a video game tournament amojg friends, and we&#39;ve always done 2v2 games only. Typically the best and most competitive games are from the Xbox 360 era on - we&#39;ve sunk a lot of time into stuff like QuadSmash and Clusterpuck.</p> <p>I&#39;m looking for competitive stuff, can be 8-bit up through 360, think easy to pick up, difficult to master. Trying to avoid full blown sports games or fighting games, mini games within collections are also ideal.</p> <p>We also play some 8p chaos games like Knight Squad, so free for all multiplayer also fits the bill.

## 90's kids may get this one. I am pretty proud of it. I have not posted anything for quite a while, but I feel this one is worthy enough. I think it looks pretty good with my scale garage stuff! X1C for main unit, and A1M for buttons and misc.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi group, I&#39;ve been using chatGPT to help me understand and install certain settings on RetroArch. It has been wonderful by saving me time on forums or google looking for answers, for example; It showed me how to set the CRT filters or shaders and how to transfer my SAV files from my SNES mini to RetroArch.</p> <p>It helped me run Rondo of Blood by guiding me on how to install the Turbo&#39;s BIOS files.<br/> Being able to use CRT filters or shadres has been a game-changing on my emulation and I&#39;ve been emulating since like &#39;96.</p> <p>It has also helped me pass through certain levels in some games. It&#39;s been awesome and it makes me wanna know other ideas or use cases I can use from LLMs to enjoy my gaming.</p> <p>How have you been using LLMs or AI in your emulation? :D</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/alejandronanuz"> /u/alejandronanuz </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.
