Willing to try anything to help in the interim while I convince her to talk to a professional.</p> <p>Broad themes of what she\u2019s struggling with are aging / not feeling like she\u2019s accomplished anything, feeling behind her friends who are married / have kids (she\u2019s single), finding purpose, and in my opinion, negative self-talk and not finding the good in herself or finding what fulfills her. </p> <p>Looking for books that touch on any of these themes. She\u2019s not a very touchy-feely person so she\u2019d respond well to a more straight forward tone. She also connects with personal anecdotes so memoirs are also on the table.

Where Jack walks into the lounge and starts talking to ghosts and drinking from alcohol that never existed in the first place, where Wendy starts hearing big band music and dwells on how great the party is going, where Danny has his foreshadowing visions. I want to read a book that makes me feel like I\u2019m also slowly losing my mind, rather than being worried about a slasher chasing me. Movies that give me a similar feel that I love are Inception, Shutter Island, and I also just love movies like About Time and Blade Runner 2049, if that helps.

I would prefer the child be male, and a young adolescent, somewhere between kid and teenager. Bonus points if they are adopted by a wealthy couple, not celebrities per se, but they are financially comfortable. The couple doesn&#39;t have other children, so they learn to navigate life as new parents throughout the story. I&#39;m looking for something with a lot of introspective, emotional moments, and healing from past abuse for the child. Something that is focused on the interpersonal relationships between the couple and the adopted kid. I think that would qualify as feel-good fiction? It can be from the kid or parent&#39;s perspective, but I would prefer both. </p> <p>I&#39;m most likely being too specific with my request, so this may not exist.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/DepressedRain81",

I myself have always preferred older characters and an older protagonist, so I&#39;m wondering if anyone could have some recommendations!</p> <p>Just to clarify, I&#39;m not looking for characters who&#39;s ages have been explicitly stated. I&#39;m just looking for characters who, more or less, don&#39;t feel like they&#39;re all 20 years old like many characters in YA novels do (and that&#39;s not a bad thing!

Here\u2019s what I recall: </p> <p>The story centers around a family who moves into a house that belonged to a deceased relative. The family includes a father (who seems to be the protagonist), a mother, twin daughters, a son, and the mother\u2019s mother.<br/> One by one, family members die due to a curse that seems connected to mysterious gifts they receive. Each gift comes with a ruin or a symbol written on strange paper, and once the paper is exposed to the elements, the recipient dies within a week.<br/> I remember specific tragic deaths: the son dies after being struck by lightning while chasing his dog during a thunderstorm; the mother dies when a sharp icicle (or some kind of ice) falls and pierces her eye; and the grandmother dies after being stung by bees while picking apples. </p> <p>The tone of the book is dark, mysterious, and tragic, with a focus on the curse",

Recently I\u2019ve only read more classic novels. I don\u2019t know why, it\u2019s not to be pretentious. It\u2019s just easy for me to pick up a book with a name I\u2019m familiar with, but these can be arduous reads for me. I particularly like Dostoyevsky, Tolstoy, D.H. Lawrence, anything that dives deep into human nature. I need to branch out and very much want to read something more modern but have no idea where to start. Not a huge fan of historical fiction, crime or fantasy.

He\u2019s isolated himself and lost many friends in the process.</p> <p>He listens to podcasts about adhd to navigate that, but often tells me that he lacks PURPOSE and he feels lost in life. He has lost who he is.</p> <p>It feels as if he thinks that everyone walks around with a purpose that is like a lighthouse guiding their way in life, and it\u2019s always the answer to any question. It could probably be like that, but at the same time, does it have to be so grand?</p> <p>I\u2019m looking for self help books, biographies, or anything that he could relate to in terms of finding a purpose and himself. </p> <p>I personally love Hermann Hesse\u2019s both Demian and Siddhartha, but I think they\u2019re too\u2026 heavy?</p> <p>So hopefully so",
