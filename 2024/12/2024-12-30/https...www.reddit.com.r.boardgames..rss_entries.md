The issue is that the murder never wins when we play unless there is a mistake.</p> <p>The location and cause of death clue cards seem to always pinpoint exactly who did it. The location cards are way too specific (since you can choose the best one of 4). I heard the expansion has a more general/vague location card. Should I make my own version of that card?</p> <p>I&#39;m having a hard time convincing my friends to play this game since it never seems to work out when we try. We usually have around 6 people. Could that be too low? Should we always play with 6 clue and 6 means cards?</p> <p>We also get the murderer to try and take their time picking their cards but it still ends up being too easy.</p> <p>Thanks.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Joshvideo"> /u/Joshvideo </a> <br/> <span><a href="https:/

Big big win. </p> <p>The tunneling mechanic definitely screwed me over but also adds another layer of fun into the game. The ferry mechanic made the locomotives (rainbow/wildcards) that much important. Most of the time those were snagged as soon as they hit the line up. </p> <p>Would purchase and recommended!

Group into a party to defeat a monster then all party members suffer all the bad before and after battle effects and suffer all the wounds each, but the reward is split so no incentive to group </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a hre

So many classics, like Ra, Scythe, El Grande, Cascadia, Frosthaven, Descent...

I&#39;ve always been the &quot;game guy&quot; though i dont have many. My friends mainly just played monopoly, risk and stuff like that. They like board games, we just aren&#39;t committed enough to make it a hobby.</p> <p>So, anyway. I was looking for a game to play with 6 players. They really love Citadels, so much that many bought it even though they dont play many board games, and hated the Game of Thrones risk-like game, and i wanted to bring something new.</p> <p>Something immediate but deep enough to be entertaining in the medium-long run, where agency of the player matters and where there is some sort of conflict between players.</p> <p>Personally, I loved Puerto Rico, but it lacks the dicrect PvP aspect. I was thinking about Catan+6 player expansion. Any other suggestion? </p> <p>Quick please, i dont have much time </p> </div>

This culminated during the last game where I finally had a good roll (with 9 dice) to put me in position to win when I again rolled 3 danger markers within 3 rolls to spin out right at the finish line before crossing.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I must say, there&#39;s allot I love about gloomhaven (specifically jaws of the lion, cuz that&#39;s the game I got); All the character types, progression of unlocking new cards, items, the hex grid system, setting etc.</p> <p>However, I find all the upkeep very difficult. Flipping cards on every attack by enemy or myself, tokens to track enemies healths which are fiddily and easy to mix around between another unit of same enemy type, or god lord the different status effects like poison, that u gotta remember to remove at the end of round too.. so small and hard to remember.</p> <p>is there a game that&#39;s epicy, campaigning with progression between scenarios, but lesser up keep than gloomhaven?</p> <p>for context (if this helps in any way), I find Death may die&#39;s or marvel champions upkeep quite manageable.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Acceptable-Drink7987"> /u/Acceptable-Drink7987 <

## Boss Monster: very light Dungeon Keeper the board game

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Okay competitive filler with tableau building. Essentially a very simplified tabletop version of Dungeon Keeper. You focus on building dungeons to lure heroes there and kill them, and compete with other dungeon lords, who will gather most unlucky souls of adventurers first.</p> <p>There is a bit of strategy: which types of heroes to collect, since different dungeon rooms attract different kinds of heroes, warriors, thieves, mages etc. </p> <p>A bit of combinations: hopefully your different types of rooms will interact efficiently - you do not want heroes to reach your boss alive and hurt him!</p> <p>A bit of interaction between players: dirty tricks (spell)s to throw at each other. </p> <p>Game is prety random due to random cards draw and random arrival of heroes (it so there is a chance that one dungeon boss gets a buncxh of them while others get nothing or almost nothing), but on the other hand it is fast. </p> <p>Also art is cute, very retro style
