I read hundreds of books on it, kept it in great condition, and used it every day. I then sort of fell out of using one in favor of traditional books following college and have been enjoying those ever since. </p> <p>That is until I started reading the first Dungeon Crawler Carl book 2 days ago and absolutely tore through it. Like a lot of people, I found the premise a bit silly and off-putting at a glance with the humor, dungeon-crawling, and stat-system all being far different from what I usually read. But the consistently positive reviews for this series on this sub combined with the assurances that the litRPG system, humor, and characters were all great made me curious. </p> <p>I haven&#39;t had that much fun reading a book in a long time. Everything in the series works for me from the author making the litRPG style humorous without being annoying, engaging without being overly complex ",

I&#39;ve never really explored any non fiction or really anything based in this world that comes to mind.<br/> My favorite series is the Lord of the rings and the whole tolkein legendarium. Some other top contenders coming to mind being, A song of ice and fire, Kingkiller Chronicles, John Gwynne, Stephen King and I&#39;ve recently started into Brandon Sanderson. </p> <p>After finishing my latest read of the Silmarillion I&#39;ve been thinking I might enjoy something more based in reality but still along those lines. I know much about the elder days in fantasy world but not much in our own. So essentially I am looking for recommendations for books along the lines of Greek, Roman, Norse history whether they be Non fiction (but not to dry like a textbook) or I would also be interested in any good books relating stories of those Mythologies. </p> <p>Thanks so much. </p> <p>TL",

Was there an &quot;aha!&quot; moment?</p> <p>I believe this is part of a series. I&#39;d describe it as dark fantasy, although it sometimes felt more like magical realism. It&#39;s originally in Ukrainian, so it wouldn&#39;t surprise me if some of its meaning is lost in translation.

I love the idea of reading books and getting addicted to them but I can\u2019t seem to find any books that I really really enjoy. I\u2019ve read Eragon but that\u2019s super cheesy and basic, the Circle Series by Ted Dekker was really good and I thoroughly enjoyed those. (If anyone else has read them let me know lol) the Ghormanghast Trilogy sounds interesting but I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s super slow. Brandan Sanderson also intrigues me solely because of the popularity. What should I read?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/I_think_ImConcussed\"> /u/I_think_ImConcussed </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1hpgnbv/alright_yall_have_at_it_give_me_some_books_to_get/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comm",

That&#39;s about as bland and basic a map as one could come up with.

The first few chapters have a siege where an army is fighting this epic dragon moon lord who lives on a floating mountain. </p></li> <li><p>It&#39;s 10/10 escapism. It has a long journey through a magical land but also a long journey through different time periods on that land.</p></li> <li><p>It&#39;s a commitment, the New Year&#39;s resolution sorts. It&#39;s complex without feeling like a chore, but it asks you to stick around for 10 books and not take breaks for long</p></li> <li><p>The author loves his world. You can tell he wrote the series with a lot of passion.</p></li> <li><p>It has memorable characters (hundreds of them) that go through all kinds of shit, including death and reincarnation/resurrectio",

Generally I don\u2019t like heavy romance or smut in my fantasy - to each their own, but for some reason it interferes with the escapism I seek in the genre. I don\u2019t mind some romantic tension or fade to black though. </p> <p>Anyway, I just finished my yearly reread of HP which has left a gaping void, I have the flu, and it\u2019s that weird period between Christmas and New Years. So I\u2019ve decided to make an exception to my rule, open my mind, and give ACOTAR a second chance.
