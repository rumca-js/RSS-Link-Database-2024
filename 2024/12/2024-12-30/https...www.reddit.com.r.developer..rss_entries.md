<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>First of all, this is just me over sharing a bit because I&#39;ve nobody to talk about that to. And I&#39;m mainly looking for clues on what to do next.</p> <p>I&#39;m a full stack software developer (python/js) and I was fired almost 6 months ago, because I got burnt out and once I got back at work, they fired me. Having close to 6 years of EXP, I&#39;ve decided to switch as freelance and work on my own projects.</p> <p>But I really struggle finding customers and making money. With the era of Ai coming in, I&#39;m also fearing for my job. Basically, I&#39;m questioning my choice of becoming freelance and if there&#39;s still hope for me in the future. And if yes, how to start finding customers.</p> <p>I&#39;m sorry if I didn&#39;t post it the right sub.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Bravo2bad"> /u/Bravo2bad </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1hpbu2n/is_there_
