But there are a ton of great games outside the Season One offerings too, for when you\u2019ve finished the whole batch or, for newer players, while you\u2019re waiting for new games between the weekly drops. Here, I\u2019ll highlight some of the best games I\u2019ve played so far from the Playdate Catalog. It\u2019ll mainly be split two ways: games that use the crank and games that don\u2019t. There are also a couple of titles that aren\u2019t <em>quite</em> games, but are worth checking out all the same.</p> \n<h",
