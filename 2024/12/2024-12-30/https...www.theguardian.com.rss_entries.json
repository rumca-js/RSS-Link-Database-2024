The sheer character Van Gerwen showed as he fought off a sizzling comeback from Jeffrey de Graaf! Whatever you thought you knew about Van Gerwen\u2019s chances of claiming his fourth world title, reconsider them now. Because on this form it\u2019s worth asking: who stops him?</p><p>To watch the world No 3 and the world No 81 punch lumps out of each other in front of a riotous Alexandra Palace crowd was to discover a thorough repudiation of Newton\u2019s third law of motion. Here every action seemed to produce a violently disproportionate reaction. First Van Gerwen sailed into a two-set lead, abetted by a painfully off-beam De Graaf. Then the Swede exploded after the break, whitewashing the third set in just 40 darts and sensationally levelling the match at 2-2.</p> ",

When it comes to ham, it isn\u2019t enough to hope that there are leftovers; it is necessary to <em>ensure</em> that there are leftovers, for sandwiches or to go with fried eggs and thin chips. And because a little ham goes a long way, I hope for leftovers of leftovers, which can be cut into small chunks and added to ham ",
