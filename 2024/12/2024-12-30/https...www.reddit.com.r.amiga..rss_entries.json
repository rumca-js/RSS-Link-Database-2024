I have installed 3.1 from ADF images. All good. </p> <p>Now I realize I dont really have floppy for things like my <a href=\"http://amiga.resource.cx/exp/ariadne2\">Ariadne II</a> card, Picasso IV etc. I have mostly LHA files of everything and Im trying to figure out the best approach here. </p> <p>What I&#39;m currently thinking is to create a separate ADF floppy on my other Amiga (or in an emulator) and load it with &quot;good stuff&quot; like lha, 060 lib, p96, Ariadne device, Miami, MUI etc. to get me started at least.</p> <p>Are there any other good ways? </p> <p>I Aso have a Zip drive and an Zulu SCSI that im not using atm, Was thinking to use that as my main HD and use the CF card as &quot;tools drive&quot; </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/kY2iB3yH0mN8wI2h\"> ",

But it works on Amiga 1200 and above. To sanity check, I ported to different systems. Hope I can get it to work on Amiga 500 and Kick 1.3 soon.</p> <p>So once that is done, I&#39;ll be writing a small visual novel type of text adventure game for retro computers with graphics and all, but the twist is that some characters would generate their dialog with llm.
