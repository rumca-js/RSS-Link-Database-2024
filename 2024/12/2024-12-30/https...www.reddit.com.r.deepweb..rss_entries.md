<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m trying to get into the dark/deep webs(idk what yall wanna call it) for personal business reasons. I was curious what browsers(tor/nord/etc.) is best for me. I tried nord but i cant figure out how to download the actual browser. Tor had low ratings in my google play store. I have an acer laptop so whatever is the best with the highest security would be preferred. Please let me know. Also if you have any tips for a new guy on there lmk.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SkeveMartin"> /u/SkeveMartin </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/deepweb/comments/1hpv3dd/new_to_the_dark_webs/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/deepweb/comments/1hpv3dd/new_to_the_dark_webs/">[comments]</a></span>
