Since this sub doesn&#39;t do the official &quot;year end wrap up threads&quot; anymore, I thought I&#39;d just make a special thread to ask people for their niche recommendations. We all know about the Astro Boys and Metaphors and FF Rebirths of the world, but what are the rest of us missing?</p> <p>My recommendation is for <strong>Shadow of the Ninja Reborn</strong>. It&#39;s a traditional 2D action platformer (i.e., <em>not</em> Metroidvania), and - despite that being one of the most prolific genres in the history of video games - I think it&#39;s one of the best ever made. It really stands shoulder-to-shoulder with the likes of Rondo of Blood, Alien Soldier, and GNG Resurrection IMO. T",
