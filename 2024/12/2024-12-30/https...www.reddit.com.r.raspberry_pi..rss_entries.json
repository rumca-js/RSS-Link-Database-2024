I tried installing <code>xserver-xorg-video-dummy</code>, and it seems to work, but every time I reboot, I can&#39;t reconnect my physical monitor. The HDMI port gets disabled, and I can&#39;t find a way to re-enable it. I&#39;m also unable to install the virtual monitor without disabling the HDMI ports.</p> <p>Does anyone know how I could install the virtual monitor while still being able to use a physical screen from time to time?</p> <p>Thanks in advance for your help!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Maxvy66\"> /u/Maxvy66 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1hpde6k/setting_up_virtual_and_physical_monitors_on/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <",
