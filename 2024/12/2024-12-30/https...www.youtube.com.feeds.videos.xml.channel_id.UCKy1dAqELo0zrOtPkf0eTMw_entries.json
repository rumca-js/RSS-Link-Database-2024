In IGN\u2019s Squid Game season 2 review, we discuss how Squid Game finds its second wind by exploring the complex layers of a deadly system. Storytelling continues to be Squid Game\u2019s strongest asset, and a leaner season two helps to focus energy on a more nuanced approach to this expanding fictional Squid Game universe.\n\nSquid Game Season 2 stars Lee Jung-jae, Yim Si-wan, Kang Ha-neul, Park Gyu-young,Park Sung-hoon, Jo Yu-ri, Cho Sang-woo, Yang Dong-geun, Kang Ae-sim, Lee David, Lee Jin-uk, Choi Seung-hyun, Roh Jae-won, Won Ji-an and more! And of course, it wouldn\u2019t be Squid Game without creator and director Hwang Dong-hyuk.",
