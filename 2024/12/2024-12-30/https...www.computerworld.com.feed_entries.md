<p>OpenAI thinks it has found a way to make its transformation from non-profit to for-profit a little more palatable: make the for-profit part a Delaware Public Benefit Corporation, while quietly limiting the ability of the non-profit board to oversee commercial operations.</p>

<p>We may be on the brink of 2025, but PDFs are still unavoidable in the professional world. No matter what industry you work in, you’re bound to whittle away precious moments wading through reports, white papers, and other dense documents in that clunky-feeling form.</p>



<p>If that sounds all too familiar, take heed: Adobe thinks it’s at long last found a way to bring PDFs into the current century — thanks to the power of AI.</p>

<p>That’s the cycle for what actually happens. At any point during this cycle, the rumors or leaks might turn out to be wrong. Companies could change their minds, or internal trials might show that they shouldn’t pursue an actual direction.</p>
