<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>One of their pwn challenges that I won&#39;t attempt to spell was about becoming root in Stock ToaruOS 2.2.0. A wonderful hobby OS by Kevin Lange.</p> <p>The flag encouraged people to report the issues they found after the CTF, so there are a lot of issues on the projects github page that are very instructive for kernel level bugs. Some even with PoCs.</p> <p>If you are curious or trying to get into this stuff, it&#39;s probably a lot more accessible than &quot;real&quot; kernel vulns on any major OS. So take a look. <a href="https://github.com/klange/toaruos/issues">https://github.com/klange/toaruos/issues</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Firzen_"> /u/Firzen_ </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1hq0opy/hxp_ctf_ended_yesterday_and_had_a_great_challenge/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1hq0opy/hxp_ctf_ended_yester
