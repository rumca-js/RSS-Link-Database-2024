Vertical tile shower wall tips…I use the wet saw and grinder to cut around my shower glass u-channel. Any chipping can be addressed with a 200 or 400 grit polishing pad. The most important step is getting full mortar coverage. I shoot for at least 95% coverage. The tile leveling system helps keep everything flat at the edges 👍🏽🔥#tile #tileshower #bathroomremodel #homerenovationideas
