<ul><li>Three-time PDC world champion beat Swede 4-2 in last 16</li><li>Stephen Bunting and Nathan Aspinall also advance</li></ul><p>A statement win for Michael van Gerwen, but also in its own way an exclamation, a command and question. The sheer character Van Gerwen showed as he fought off a sizzling comeback from Jeffrey de Graaf! Whatever you thought you knew about Van Gerwen’s chances of claiming his fourth world title, reconsider them now. Because on this form it’s worth asking: who stops him?</p><p>To watch the world No 3 and the world No 81 punch lumps out of each other in front of a riotous Alexandra Palace crowd was to discover a thorough repudiation of Newton’s third law of motion. Here every action seemed to produce a violently disproportionate reaction. First Van Gerwen sailed into a two-set lead, abetted by a painfully off-beam De Graaf. Then the Swede exploded after the break, whitewashing the third set in just 40 darts and sensationally levelling the match at 2-2.</p>

<p>Manchester United are dipping towards the drop zone under Ruben Amorim, a head coach who took over on 11 November and forgot to pack the “bounce” often gifted to an employer after sacking the last guy. This is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2024/dec/30/manchester-united-v-newcastle-united-premier-league-live-score-updates">United’s fourth consecutive loss</a> and, after 11 games, the Portuguese coach’s record reads six defeats and four wins.</p><p>Peer at the table and Amorim’s side are 14th on 22 points after taking the same number, 11, in nine league matches as they did under Erik ten Hag, his predecessor. Yet again the 3-4-3 formation failed and to see Joshua Zirkzee yanked off after the half hour was to witness an encapsulation of United’s disarray. Another was the reinstatement of Marcus Rashford to the squad after the forward said he wanted a “new challenge”. Make sense of the head coach’s thinking on that one, if you&nbsp;can.</p> <a href="https://www.th

<p>Ipswich’s wait is over. Portman Road would not be denied its first Premier League win since April 2002. Chelsea’s title challenge, such as it was, will not reach 2025.

<p><strong>Queen Elizabeth Hall, London<br></strong>This hotch-potch musical with disappointingly broad characters, jarring over-acting and lack of emotional impact falls flat</p><p>This tale about a town whose grownups mysteriously disappear plays on the concept of children “Home Alone” but with added scares and a climate message. All the elements of an appealing children’s show are in this adaptation of Tom Fletcher’s book, from puppetry to song and dance, yet it fails to create magic.</p><p>Under Tom Jackson Greaves’s direction, the story is too slow to set off, with the Creakers – rubbish-loving monsters, of sorts – not emerging in fullness until the end of the first act. When they do reveal themselves they are an interesting mix of the cuddly and grotesque, but not characterful enough.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2024/dec/30/the-creakers-a-magical-musical-adventure-review-queen-elizabeth-hall-london-mcfly-tom-fletcher">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The average woman in the UK will spend 474 days applying makeup. Without it, I have more time for a life well spent</p><p>I am not sure when I gave up wearing makeup. I was never particularly good at it. As a student, I was thrown into an early 2000s performance of femininity that involved thick eyeliner flicks, dyed hair, doll-like blusher and bright pink lips. I felt the pressure of magazines, adverts and other women’s faces pressing me towards cosmetics like a hockey player being clapped into drinking beer out of their own shoe.</p><p>The fact that I never had the patience or the money to pull it off didn’t seem to matter. I wore makeup to work and even more makeup to sweat off on the dancefloor when I wasn’t at work. As my 20s slid into my 30s, I still wore mascara most days. I still owned lipsticks and liquid eyeliners and a vintage powder compact. I could still slap it on in the office toilet mirrors, under the arctic glare of a unisex lightbulb.</p> <a href="https://www.the

There’s far more to it than ‘good’ or ‘bad’ genes</p><p>Like so many of us, I was dispirited to wake up a few weeks ago to learn that Donald Trump will be back in the White House. This time he was aided by the world’s richest man and professional spaceship-crasher, Elon Musk.

Trump is an enthusiastic <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2020-10-05/trump-debate-white-supremacy-racehorse-theory">advocate</a> of “racehorse theory”, which he shares with white supremacists; the belief that he is personally superior and that this is rooted in his “good genes”.

Whether it was cathartic, or Wilson was simply happy to put up the Jets’ first points of the day, the vibe had shifted.</p><p>Two interceptions, one of which perfec

<p>A Polish ex-soldier returns to his home town and takes on local gangsters in an exhausting barrage of violence in humourless action film</p><p>Here is a film from Poland that is proof that when a macho action hero has a canine sidekick, it makes him at least 64% more likable. The dog – a veteran of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan – is called Tiny (the name is ironic, she’s huge). Her human is Maks (Eryk Lubos), a brooding loner who served 25 years in an elite special forces unit. Maks doesn’t say much and betrays less emotion than his dog. The pair of them live off-grid deep in the forest until, one wintry afternoon, news arrives that Maks’s father is dead.</p><p>Back in his home town, Maks is greeted like a returning hero. But after the funeral, before he can slip back into his lumberjack shirt, he disturbs a break-in at his father’s house. He instantly switches into fighting-machine mode, biffing the bad guys and breaking the nose of a local gangland thug’s son. So begins an exhaus

<p>Critics often imply his time in the White House was a failure, but Carter got more done in four years than most presidents accomplish in twice the time</p><p>Jimmy Carter has died. He is sometimes referred to, especially by Republican critics, as America’s best former president – implying that his time in the White House was, by contrast, a failure. In fact, he was by most measures a highly successful one-term president, getting more done in four years than most presidents accomplish in twice the time.</p><p>It is true that his post-presidency accomplishments were unprecedented – a fact attested to by, among other things, his receipt of the 2002 Nobel peace prize for “his decades of untiring effort to find peaceful solutions to international conflicts, to advance democracy and human rights, and to promote economic and social development”.</p><p>Peter G Bourne served in the Carter White House as special assistant to the president.

<p>A novel approach to a side of gammon, wrapped in fresh bread, may well be your new favourite party centrepiece</p><p>As well as being a glorious thing, a well-cured ham is a generous thing, giving many times over. The first is the simmering, which Nigella Lawson describes as “a savoury clove-scented fog” filling the room, poaching the joint and creating a highly flavoured stock for later use. Then comes the second fog of roasting meat and, in the case of this recipe, the bread wrapped around it, which is an idea borrowed from a cafeteria buffet in Trieste.</p><p>There is the pleasure of ham itself, too, brought to the table, carved and enjoyed, but only up to a point. When it comes to ham, it isn’t enough to hope that there are leftovers; it is necessary to <em>ensure</em> that there are leftovers, for sandwiches or to go with fried eggs and thin chips. And because a little ham goes a long way, I hope for leftovers of leftovers, which can be cut into small chunks and added to ham

Reality, however, has become much more frightening than fiction. As a result of the climate crisis, unprecedented natural disasters have wiped out countless herds, including Davaa and Zaya’s own.
