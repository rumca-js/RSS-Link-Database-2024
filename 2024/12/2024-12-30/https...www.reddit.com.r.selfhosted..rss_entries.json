It\u2019s a simple, lightweight alternative to Google Analytics.</p> <p>I\u2019ve been trial-running it for a while now and really like it because it\u2019s straightforward and not overwhelming to use (I can now see my visitors beyond the 30-minute mark <code>;-)</code>). Since my trial period is ending soon, it was high time to decide what to do.</p> <p>You can either use Plausible in the cloud or self-host it. I chose to self-host it because <a href=\"https://kamal-deploy.org/\">Kamal</a> makes it a breeze, and the requirements are minimal.</p> <p>Read more here: <a href=\"https://kyrylo.org/kamal/2024/11/15/how-to-self-host-plausible-analytics-with-kamal.html\">https://kyrylo.org/kamal/2024/11/15/how-to-self-host-plausible-analytics-with-kamal.html</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted ",

I also want to try out imich.</p> <p>I am considering a n100-based machine as I have good experience with this processor and I am thinking about setting up these applications using proxmox. So far so good.</p> <p>However I would like to pass the iGPU to plex and imich for obvious reasons. Is this feasible in a proxmox setup with separate VMs in LXCs using gvt-g (if possible?) or should I abandon proxmox, use ubuntu+docker and share igpu that way (if possible?)</p> <p>Any help is appreciated!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Torgshop86\"> /u/Torgshop86 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1hppkj9/igpu_passt",
