<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Back in high school, I got a Kindle and absolutely loved it. I read hundreds of books on it, kept it in great condition, and used it every day. I then sort of fell out of using one in favor of traditional books following college and have been enjoying those ever since. </p> <p>That is until I started reading the first Dungeon Crawler Carl book 2 days ago and absolutely tore through it. Like a lot of people, I found the premise a bit silly and off-putting at a glance with the humor, dungeon-crawling, and stat-system all being far different from what I usually read. But the consistently positive reviews for this series on this sub combined with the assurances that the litRPG system, humor, and characters were all great made me curious. </p> <p>I haven&#39;t had that much fun reading a book in a long time. Everything in the series works for me from the author making the litRPG style humorous without being annoying, engaging without being overly complex

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello, Let me start by saying I am a huge fantasy and science fiction book fan. I&#39;ve never really explored any non fiction or really anything based in this world that comes to mind.<br/> My favorite series is the Lord of the rings and the whole tolkein legendarium. Some other top contenders coming to mind being, A song of ice and fire, Kingkiller Chronicles, John Gwynne, Stephen King and I&#39;ve recently started into Brandon Sanderson. </p> <p>After finishing my latest read of the Silmarillion I&#39;ve been thinking I might enjoy something more based in reality but still along those lines. I know much about the elder days in fantasy world but not much in our own. So essentially I am looking for recommendations for books along the lines of Greek, Roman, Norse history whether they be Non fiction (but not to dry like a textbook) or I would also be interested in any good books relating stories of those Mythologies. </p> <p>Thanks so much. </p> <p>TL

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>One of my favorite type of fantasy novel is the coming of age fantasy adventure. These <em>typically</em> have a young male protagonist, some tragedy, and then them getting older/wiser, and overcoming obstacles while exploring the world with great world building. However, they all usually have this great flaw where it becomes a magical school novel, completely halting the adventure and the world building and intrigue. </p> <p>Some examples:</p> <ul> <li><p><em>The Name of the Wind</em> This is probably my favorite example of this sub-genre. I absolutely loved it...up until the part where the MC was stuck in a school. </p></li> <li><p><em>Assassin&#39;s Apprentice</em> I enjoyed it, but felt like the scope and world building was not that good.

I don&#39;t think I have fully digested this book and at the moment don&#39;t know if I&#39;m wowed by it or let down. It&#39;s the type of book you either hate or love and probably needs to be interpreted openly. Have any of you read it? What are your thoughts? What did you take away from it? Was there an &quot;aha!&quot; moment?</p> <p>I believe this is part of a series. I&#39;d describe it as dark fantasy, although it sometimes felt more like magical realism. It&#39;s originally in Ukrainian, so it wouldn&#39;t surprise me if some of its meaning is lost in translation. It&#39;s a literary piece of work with dark academia vibes - definitely not something to read quickly like I did because I&#39;m a masochist.</p> <p>Please mark your comments with spoilers if it applies.</p> </div><!-- SC

I completely understand that we re-living the story through Severian, a sheltered young man who doesn&#39;t understand much about his adventure or the people he meets (thus making him an unreliable narrator). </p> <p>But the treatment of women by Severian, and his expectations of women are such that I really don&#39;t want to invest my time in three more books which by many accounts only seems to get worse. If Severian was a villain I would have no problem with this. If Severian is a hero where his motivations and thinking about women has some sort of plausible explanation then this is fine too. </p> <p>But it is too much of a stretch for me that due to his relatively sheltered life, his expectations of reality are what they are. What this actually smacks of is what I tend to think are the worst kinds of 80s sci-fi tropes where the all action male hero has women throwing themse

It seems so obvious that the author simply wanted to create a rift between them without really considering what was natural for her characters</p> <p>I also don&#39;t understand the inconsistencies within the book. For example: Celaena killed for Chaol and risked her life for him but she couldn’t bring herself to forgive him for not telling her some information about how the king wanted to ask Nahemia some questions? </p> <p>Chaol is also described very inconsistently. Like one moment he is risking his life for Celaena and is generally good and steadfast man and the next he is calling her a monster because she is fae and has magic. </p> <p>I just feel like

She did this too with ACOTAR too but at least it wasn&#39;t as bad.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Scantra"> /u/Scantra </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1hpqplm/sarah_j_maas_rant/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1hpqplm/sarah_j_maas_rant/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone, I&#39;m wrapping up Wind and Truth currently and my outlined reading list for next year has me more anxious than excited. There are a few longer series I want to tackle but also want to leave room for some anticipated releases. I&#39;ve read all of the cosmere except mistborn era 2 so have that, realm of the elderlings (first 9 books) and the green bone&#39;s sage as my main target but afraid that&#39;s going to consume all of 2025. How do you go about organizing your reading list to tackle large series but also have room for flexibility?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Ataraxia14"> /u/Ataraxia14 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1hph6n9/tbr_overload/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1hph6n9/tbr_overload/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So i just finished the Sword of Kaigen, loved it overall, though it was a long book (for me) at 600+ pages. Im an overall slow reader, only reading a few pages a night typically. However this weekend i blasted through like 10 chapters to finish it. (again, alot for me).</p> <p>With that book out of the way, im onto the next and wanting to see how many books i can read in a year, starting on the 1st. </p> <p>The 2 choices that im between are Guards Guards by Terry Pratchett, or Howling Dark by Christopher Ruocchio. </p> <p>Ive havent read a Terry Pratchett book, ever, however i have listened to some of Mort via audiobook and liked it from what i heard. Guards Guards seems like a little less serious of a read and a shorter book at ~350 pages, which is why its on the list. Though again, 350 pages will take me a few weeks lol. I know im sorry.</p> <p>OR</p> <p>Do i read the 2nd book of the Sun Eater series? This is another 600+ page book. I read The Empi

I’ve read Eragon but that’s super cheesy and basic, the Circle Series by Ted Dekker was really good and I thoroughly enjoyed those.

No magic, no prophecies, no grand speeches about destroying the world. Just cold, ruthless pragmatism and absolute certainty in his own righteousness. He&#39;s terrifying because you can actually imagine meeting someone like him.</p> <p>Or look at Low-Key Lyesmith from American Gods. [Minor Spoilers ahead] The brilliance is how naturally he fits into the world before you realize what he really is. He doesn&#39;t announce his villainy - he&#39;s just there, subtle as a knife between the ribs.</p> <p>My personal favorite might be Mayor Prentiss from the Chaos Walking trilogy.

However, I personally don&#39;t get why so many people like them.</p> <p>I read the first two books and lacked motivation to read the third and fourth. For starters, the world itself felt very, very generic. The continent of Alagaesia is literally just ocean to the west, big desert in the middle, mountains to the south and forest to the north, plus another mountain range on the coast. That&#39;s about as bland and basic a map as one could come up with. The sentient races in said world are basically orcs, humans, elves, and dwarves, plus a few dragons, and all of the races correspond one-to-one with the standard fantasy depiction of them: dwarves mine and live in the mountains, plus they live long and hold grudges;
