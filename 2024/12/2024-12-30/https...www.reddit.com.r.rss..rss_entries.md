<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey guys, how do you handle following social media applications accounts via RSS? I’ve been just testing a tool is called Follow that supports to subscribe multiple applications such as X(Twitter), and it’s an open-sourced project in GitHub. <a href="https://github.com/RSSNext/Follow">https://github.com/RSSNext/Follow</a> However, based my experience, I’ve noticed some accounts, like Donald Trump’s, shows errors about a month ago, and can’t receive further updates. Furthermore, some YouTube Channels I followed, their RSS Feeds created by Follow directly through their original URLs seem that the images cannot be displayed correctly in their updates, while there’s no such problem in the same channel’s updates subscribed through the search bar found out. Unfortunately, I can&#39;t find most favorited Channels through the search bar... Has anyone else tested Follow&#39;s feature, or are there other tools that support multiple applications’ subscriptions?
