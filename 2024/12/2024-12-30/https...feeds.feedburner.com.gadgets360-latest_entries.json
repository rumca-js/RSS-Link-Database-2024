Among these findings is the potential detection of an intermediate black hole near Sagittarius A*, bridging the gap between stellar-mass and supermassive black holes. The James Webb Space Telescope observed a supermassive black hole consuming material at rates defying theoretical limits, shedding light on the rapid growth of early black holes. Theories suggest primordial black holes may have formed from collapsing gas clouds, potentially solving the mystery of dark matter. Astronomers also documented record-long plasma jets spanning 23 million light-years and linked \u201cheartbeat\u201d signals in black hole flares to shock waves in consumed material.",
