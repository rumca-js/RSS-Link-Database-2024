<p class="has-drop-cap has-text-align-none">In the fall of 2021 the burnout, my friends, was real. That October, I determined that I needed to rapidly disassemble my day-to-day routine, yeet myself clear of everything that I considered normal, and not deal with… anything for just a little while, at least. The tool I used to break the chains that bound me to a cable modem and my three LCD screens was backpacking. Four years on now and it’s sort of stuck, and it’s all YouTube’s fault.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All three YouTubers create content in the storytime animation genre. This is when an artist narrates a story, usually comedic or lighthearted in nature, while depicting its events in an animation or animatic — an animated storyboard with fewer frames than a traditional animation.

<p class="has-text-align-none">First released as <em>Clue</em> in the United States in 1949 by Parker Brothers, the game has sold more than 150 million copies and is listed as the second-most-popular board game in the world behind <em>Monopoly </em>(and not including chess and checkers), according to Hasbro, which bought Parker Brothers in 1991. But <em>Clue</em>’s story doesn’t actually start in 1949. The game dates back even further, all the way to the second World War.</p>
