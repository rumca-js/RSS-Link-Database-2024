This MSI Katana 15 with an impressive configuration is <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/msi-katana-15-15-6-144hz-fhd-gaming-laptop-ryzen-9-8945hs-with-16gb-memory-rtx-4070-1tb-ssd-black/6575345.p?skuId=6575345\">down $400 right now at Best Buy</a>, making it available for $1,100 rather than its usual $1,500.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what makes this laptop a unicorn find? Well, first of all, it comes with a Ryzen 9 CPU and 16GB of RAM. Sure, we\u2019d love to see a bit more RAM on this machine, but that\u2019s about the max you\u2019ll see at this price point. Worry not, however, because you can upgrade to a max 64GB DDR5, which will turn this laptop into a rocket.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The MSI Katana is also gaming-ready, thanks to the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 GPU.

Just as that CPU line heralded an age of Intel-driven x86 dominance, Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon X Elite chips have now taken us into a new era of competition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But 2024 was only the preview. Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon debut was limited, targeting a specific subset of premium, thin-and-light Windows laptops that don\u2019t require discrete graphics. 2025 will be the year that shows us the true extent of Arm innovation in PCs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I spoke with two expert analysts in the hardware space for insights on how Arm PCs will continue to grow going forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><strong>Further reading: </strong><a href=\"ht",
