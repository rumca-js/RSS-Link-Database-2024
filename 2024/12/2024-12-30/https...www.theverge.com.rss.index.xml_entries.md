  <p id="IsZhbe">For months, the location information of around 800,000 electric Volkswagen vehicles was available online due to a data leak, according to <a href="https://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/web/volkswagen-konzern-datenleck-wir-wissen-wo-dein-auto-steht-a-e12d33d0-97bc-493c-96d1-aa5892861027">a report from the German news magazine <em>Der Spiegel</em></a>. The leak reportedly stemmed from the software running inside Volkswagen vehicles and could've allowed a bad actor to trace a driver’s exact movements, <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/12/30/massive-data-leak-at-volkswagen-exposes-800000-ev-drivers/">as noted by <em>Electrek</em></a>.</p>
