<p>It’s not every day that we get to find fantastic laptop deals, but this one may be the best one we’ll see before the year ends. This MSI Katana 15 with an impressive configuration is <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/msi-katana-15-15-6-144hz-fhd-gaming-laptop-ryzen-9-8945hs-with-16gb-memory-rtx-4070-1tb-ssd-black/6575345.p?skuId=6575345">down $400 right now at Best Buy</a>, making it available for $1,100 rather than its usual $1,500.</p>



<p>So what makes this laptop a unicorn find? Well, first of all, it comes with a Ryzen 9 CPU and 16GB of RAM. Sure, we’d love to see a bit more RAM on this machine, but that’s about the max you’ll see at this price point. Worry not, however, because you can upgrade to a max 64GB DDR5, which will turn this laptop into a rocket.</p>



<p>The MSI Katana is also gaming-ready, thanks to the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 GPU.

<p>Qualcomm’s 2024 debut of new Arm processors for Windows laptops was arguably the most important PC hardware announcement since the introduction of Intel’s 486 processors in 1989. Just as that CPU line heralded an age of Intel-driven x86 dominance, Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X Elite chips have now taken us into a new era of competition.</p>



<p>But 2024 was only the preview. Qualcomm’s Snapdragon debut was limited, targeting a specific subset of premium, thin-and-light Windows laptops that don’t require discrete graphics. 2025 will be the year that shows us the true extent of Arm innovation in PCs.</p>



<p>I spoke with two expert analysts in the hardware space for insights on how Arm PCs will continue to grow going forward.</p>
