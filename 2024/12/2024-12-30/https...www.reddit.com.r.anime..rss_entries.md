But when dragon ball sparking zero came out, I got the craving to start watching again. I just finished my rewatch of the og Dragon ball. Witch, I had loved all 153 episodes. I plan on watching all of the dragon ball series with my wife, who is new to anime. But I didn&#39;t realize how much I missed it. I want to watch more. So I&#39;m gonna keep watching on my own as well. And I was just wondering if there&#39;s anything good I missed in 9 years. I&#39;m thinking about starting Fire force.

Even though the series has action-centric parts, the mood of the anime is generally pensive, introspective, and ultimately relaxing and calming. It also has emotional moments, but they feel much more heartwarming and endearing rather than heavy.</p> <p><strong>Yuru Camp</strong> even moreso as a slice-of-life comedy centered around group of girls who love camping. Lots of nature, chill moods and music in both shows.</p> <p>What I&#39;m asking for doesn&#39;t have to be nature-specific or anything similar (I would imagine some might suggest <strong>Mushihi</strong>, which I haven&#39;t totally explored but has come up a lot in these kinds of discussions).

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I can’t remember the name and none of my searches have worked. It’s about a guy who owns a shop and makes potions. I think that he is an alchemist. He gets this book from a friend and while he’s reading it, he falls into it. There’s like this Forrest, but he can’t go to all parts of it only certain sections and he notices that some of the stuff that’s there are ingredients that he can use for potions which make them super strong. While he’s there, he ends up meeting these magical animals that he ends up adopting I think one is a cat one is a wolf. He also meets these Beatles and helps them defeat these evil ants. this is something that also seems to be affecting the real world. And because his potions are so strong all the guilds are wanting to recruit him. If anyone can help me out I would appreciate it. Thank you.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/mihappy"> /u/mihappy </a> <br/> <span><a href="ht

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Ok, I vaguely remember an anime with a bunch of gray haired boys wondering around an old European landscape. There&#39;s some sort of suspense happening and their trying to solve some big mystery or something... At the same time there is a weird sub plot with a boy on island? It has that old fashioned anime style to it. Think Tezuka or even Night on the Galactic Railroad but with more talking. Every time I look up gray haired anime boys I get these heart throb types which is so not what I&#39;m looking for. It&#39;s an obscure one. I found it long ago but never finished it, but remembered it was really unique. This is an anime nobody is talking about too.
