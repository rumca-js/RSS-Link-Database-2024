<p>The legendary Serb intends to battle Father Time with an unlikely doubles partner and an even unlikelier coach</p><p>Novak Djokovic did not waste any time in producing a moment of magic. Flitting left of the tramlines in the first set of his 21st&nbsp;season as a professional, he bent a backhand slice between net post and umpire’s chair for a spectacular, untouchable winner. It was the type of athleticism, resourcefulness and shotmaking that has made him the most successful player of all time.</p><p>As a full, ebullient crowd under lights at the Pat Rafter Arena in Brisbane responded, Djokovic’s celebration was even more unusual than the shot; he sprinted across the court to embrace none other than Nick Kyrgios. For a long time, Djokovic and Kyrgios were only mentioned together when the Australian had fired another public, unprovoked insult towards him, yet here they stood as doubles partners on the same side of the net.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/dec/30/t

It is by Vladimir Nazor, who was Croatia’s first head of state.

<p>A brilliantly simple canapé of scallop and mushroom topped with herby breadcrumbs and served in half-shells</p><p>You can serve these in one of two ways: three scallops, each in large half-shells or small ramekins as a dinner party starter, or if you are lucky enough to have 18 small shells, serve them as canapes – my daughter appropriated my collection into her toy kitchen, so I had to beg for them back: “I’m making fish fingers in a shell!” She didn’t buy it. For anyone who isn’t a toddler, these are a lovely, easy, prep-ahead dish.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/dec/30/quick-and-easy-recipe-for-scallop-leek-and-mushroom-gratins-rukmini-iyer">Continue reading...</a>

But as they prepare to go on the road, the Williams brothers talk about their momentous decision to play without Goodwin</p><p>Just over four years ago, Doves were on the crest of a wave. Their first album in more than a decade – The Universal Want – had been rapturously received, helping them notch up their third UK No 1. All set to perform it live, the tour was suddenly cancelled due to frontman Jimi Goodwin’s mental health – he has since said he is in recovery from substance abuse.</p><p>The cancellation “was heartbreaking for us because this is all we’ve ever wanted to do,” explains guitarist Jez Williams, who formed Doves with drummer brother Andy and schoolfriend Goodwin in Wilmslow, Cheshire in 1998. Sat alongside him in a Manchester eaterie, Andy explains: “You can get away with that once, but if we had to pull a tour again it would be curtains.” Thus, in late 2023, with a new album on the way, and Go
