        "description": "Due to the SAG and Writers Strikes of 2024, there were a lot of questionable releases in theaters across the country.  Though none were quite as bad as Eli Roth's Borderlands.  Borderlands should have been a home run.  It's a beloved video game franchise ripe for adaptation to the big screen.  But even a star studded cast couldn't save Borderlands from being one of the worst movies of 2024.  Thankfully, it doesn't seem like Eli Roth will get another chance to expand his version of the Borderlands universe. \n\n#borderlands #eliroth #kevinhart #borderlands3",
