<p>Tides ebb and flow. Pendulums swing. Ideas come and go, especially in programming, where the technologies and techniques for creating software continuously evolve.</p>



<p>Some programming languages, libraries, platforms, and tools become hot and irresistible. When they’re mentioned, everyone at the planning meeting jumps on the table and cheers. Others lose steam or fall from favor, drawing sighs or blank looks. Everyone stares at their shoes. Maybe they were impossibly hot just last week, but that was then and this is now.</p>



<p>In the interest of advancing the art, here is a list of trends we’ve noticed. They’re arranged in pairs because often the rise of one approach goes hand in hand

<p>In a <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2515691/multitenant-data-management.html">previous article</a>, we explored various approaches to managing data for multitenant applications. We examined the benefits, compromises and limitations of different deployment models, including share-nothing, share-everything, and hybrid. We discussed the needs and challenges of each approach, from ensuring data isolation and scalability to managing customized tenant requirements.</p>



<p>One key takeaway from this discussion is that building multitenant applications is easier than building multitenant storage. In most cases, the application is stateless, and can adopt growth-friendly architectural pat

<p>Open Source Initiative (OSI) chief Stefano Maffulli says Meta is “bullying” the industry on the concept of <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3429076/what-is-open-source-software-open-source-and-foss-explained.html">open source</a>. The Economist more colorfully <a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2024/08/28/meta-is-accused-of-bullying-the-open-source-community">characterizes the dispute as</a> “bare-it-all purists … confronting Meta, the social-media giant controlled by a mankini-clad Mark Zuckerberg.” It’s all much ado about something as AI proves exceptionally difficult to stuff into a decades-old definition of the term <em>open source</em>, which had already been <a href="ht
