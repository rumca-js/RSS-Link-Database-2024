<blockquote>
  <p>An upcoming version of the Magic Mouse with voice control for AI
would “make sense,” Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman <a href="https://x.com/markgurman/status/1873823834123755601">said today</a>, though
he claimed that he has heard no rumors about the feature so far.</p>

<p>Alongside the voice-input mouse, it’d make just as much sense to bring back some of that 1998 iMac aesthetic by switching MacBooks to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpWhugUmV5U">transparent aluminum</a>.</p>
