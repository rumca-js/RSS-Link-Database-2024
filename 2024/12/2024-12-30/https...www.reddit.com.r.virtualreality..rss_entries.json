I have told him to just go out and buy a meta quest because of the simplicity, cost, and it would probably be nicer than the vive but apparently they do not play Google Earth VR. I want to give him options for either a prebuilt system that will run this or an easily upgradable one (simplicity is key here, he does not have time to go out and build a pc, but I can also help him out with simple upgrades like installing a graphics card to a prebuilt) Money is not really an issue here, he is happy to spend whatever it takes but I dont want to tell him to get something super overkill and have him waste money. Any thoughts on what I should recommend he get?

Yesterday bought VD so I can access its debug tool to try to narrow down the problem and might have? But not sure what to make of this, hoped someone might be able to assist.</p> <p>So an example - have a game running at stable 90Fps, its all good and stable, but then every minute or so there is a stutter. It seems to often coincide with a movement in physical space and before I got VD it was also accompanied by sudden pixelation of the image. With VD this seems not to occur.</p> <p>When this happens, FPS drops from the stable 90 to around 60 (but feels more like 10 in headset) and also it coincides with a spike in the Latency reading in VD tools. Usually its between 30-45 ms but when it stutters, it becomes orange and goes over 60ms. Also the Networking reading does the same, it becomes orange and goes from usual 5ms to over 15ms.</p> <p>An",

The game is fantastic and I am the perfect audience for that game. Well there lies the biggest problem. To me Stalker 2 is just a \u201cgame\u201d.

Windows 11 Virtual Desktop: After the latest updates, how does this perform for PCVR and productivity? 5.
