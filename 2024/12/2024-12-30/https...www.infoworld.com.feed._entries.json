Pendulums swing. Ideas come and go, especially in programming, where the technologies and techniques for creating software continuously evolve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some programming languages, libraries, platforms, and tools become hot and irresistible. When they\u2019re mentioned, everyone at the planning meeting jumps on the table and cheers. Others lose steam or fall from favor, drawing sighs or blank looks. Everyone stares at their shoes. Maybe they were impossibly hot just last week, but that was then and this is now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the interest of advancing the art, here is a list of trends we\u2019ve noticed. They\u2019re arranged in pairs because often the rise of one approach goes hand in hand",

We examined the benefits, compromises and limitations of different deployment models, including share-nothing, share-everything, and hybrid. We discussed the needs and challenges of each approach, from ensuring data isolation and scalability to managing customized tenant requirements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One key takeaway from this discussion is that building multitenant applications is easier than building multitenant storage. In most cases, the application is stateless, and can adopt growth-friendly architectural pat",
