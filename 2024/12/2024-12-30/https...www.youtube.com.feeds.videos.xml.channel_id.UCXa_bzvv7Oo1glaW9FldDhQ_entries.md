Baldur’s Gate 3 demonstrated just how much ‘game’ can be jammed into an early access build. The turn-based RPG would then go on to win countless game of the year awards with its full launch in 2023. 2024 has no shortage of early access gems shining with a similar amount of potential.

Some games on this list have been in development longer than others, nearly reaching their full launch. And then there’s the recent ones like Astrometica, which display heaps of potential with its meaningful space exploration and quality base building. 

One common denominator between all the games on this list are the low price of entry which carry over to the full release. It’s usually a bit of a risk to invest in an unfinished game, but these 15 examples exude enough quality and content in their early access form to at least warrant the consideration.

Nearly six years after Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze received a Nintendo Switch release, its predecessor is finally getting the HD treatment. Launched in 2010 for the Wii, Donkey Kong Country Returns marks the return of Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong after a long absence in a new side-scrolling platforming adventure.

The HD version carries all the new features from the Nintendo 3DS port, including New Mode, with extra hearts and a more forgiving difficulty. You can also explore a new world full of unique stages while partaking in extras like Mirror Mode and Time Attack.

Outside of using the JoyCons for local play and motion control, Donkey Kong Country Returns HD doesn't significantly revamp the original's gameplay. It's still a bonafide classic worth experiencing when it launches on January 16th, 2025, for Nintendo Switch. Here's what you should know before picking it up.
