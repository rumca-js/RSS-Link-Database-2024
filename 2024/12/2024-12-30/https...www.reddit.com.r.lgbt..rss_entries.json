I was genuinely curious and wanted to know different people&#39;s options on this so that I can start saying that I am one with an explanation as to why and that I can be. I mean, in my opinion, i don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything wrong with it, im just wearing slightly feminine clothes and other than that I appear as a male quiet frequently. I don&#39;t know. Thank you!!! &lt;3</p> <p>Edit: Thank you all for the support, this all means so much to me considering all my home stuff happening currently. For all of you guys that are so sweet and loving, I wanna give my biggest most greatful thank to you, I cannot express how much this means to me. \ud83e\udd0d</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.c",
