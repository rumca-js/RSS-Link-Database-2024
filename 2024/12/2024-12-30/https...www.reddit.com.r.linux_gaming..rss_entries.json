At the time the blizzard launcher was the only option to play this on PC. Did they ever fix that issue with the blizzard launcher or does it still not work? As of right now the only way for me to play this game is to let it download with the blizzard launcher and crack the game I paid for to remove the DRM so that I can play on my computer which is completely stupid. I tried sending blizzard and email to see if they would do a key exchange to give me a steam version and they said no. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/XDM_Inc\"> /u/XDM_Inc </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1hq1bvo/did_they_ever_fix_crash_bandicoot_4_with_b",
