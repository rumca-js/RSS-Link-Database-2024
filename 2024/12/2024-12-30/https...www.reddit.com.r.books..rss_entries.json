(Apologies if this post is not allowed, but as the main mod over at <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ayearofbookhub/\">r/ayearofbookhub</a> I just wanted to highlight these groups)</p> <p>If you are interested in reading more classics in 2025 and would like to join a book club that specializes in that, then please check out these wonderful bookish communities below. These are fun, mostly casual communities that host these book clubs for the joy of reading, so anyone with any type of background knowledge is welcome to join.</p> <p>Most of the groups read a chapter or two per week for most of the year, while some go further and read a chapter a day. Most of the groups also post regular discussion posts to talk about the texts in-depth. </p> <p>Confirmed Readings/Book Clubs:</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"/r/yearofannakarenina\">r/year",

Trust me, I\u2019m a literature major and reading classics is what I do all the time but the usage of some words had me completely stumped. I ended up building a giant vocabulary list but I\u2019m musing whether I\u2019ll end up using them anywhere. But yes, I am glad this was my last read of the year.

Dimitri ends up in prison, Smerdyakov is dead, and Ivan is mentally broken\u2014none of them seem to have a chance for redemption or closure. The only character who experiences any sort of resolution is Alyosha, but even his journey feels overshadowed by the religious and moral messages that the novel seems to push. It almost feels like the book becomes more of a sermon, with an emphasis on the idea of religious faith. Each character that denied or questioned the existence of God was punished. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Oldgit3\"> /u/Oldgit3 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hpkjb3/i_finished_the_brothers_karamazov/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hpkjb3/i_f",

I thought Sloane was gonna find a way to maintain her own values while embracing the realities of being a vampire, but I don\u2019t think murdering the first person they come across after making that decision really sells it.

I was in middle school when the movie came out and that&#39;s when I read the book. Reading it then was a different experience now. Now the white savior trope feels more obvious but it&#39;s really the dialect that gets me. Each chapter is written from the perspective of one of the 3 characters. Skeeter and all the while characters speak plainly. You wouldn&#39;t guess they&#39;re from the south based ofc how they speak but Minny, Aibileen, and all the black characters speak with not only a southern dialect but the spelling and grammar reflect that. Being from the south myself I feel that the white characters could have been written similarly and the fact that they aren&#39;t is a bit distracting. Some of the poorer white characters don&#39;t speak in dialect either. When I first read the book I didn&#39;t even notice it but it&#39;s",
