It&#39;s up there with stuff like Anaconda or Ewe Boll movies, but somehow even better. The whole movie, you&#39;re just like: Wait.. noooo, they&#39;re not seriously. Yep! Wow. How could they have decided to go with that line?! We were blown away with entertainment from start to finish, but it IS a bad movie at the end of the day. The only downside is it leaves you wishing you could watch it for the first time again. Not much re-watching value. </p> <p>It made us think a lot about what constitutes a so-bad-it&#39;s-good movie.

Ho, ho, ho!&quot; I could have SWORN there was an iconic callback to this scene later in the movie, when Gruber steals McClane&#39;s gun and disappears into a nearby elevator.

It&#39;s not overtly a Christmas movie, but the holiday cheer also adds an often forced gaiety and backdrop against the various struggles of the group of friends/protagonists. And the fact that the film ends on New Year&#39;s Eve 1959, literally as the 50s end and the 60s begin, underlines Levinson&#39;s masterful open ending that things are changing whether the main characters want it or not.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Mst3Kgf\"> /u/Mst3Kgf </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hpshiw/among_its_many_virtues_diner_is_an_excellent/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <s",

The two main characters are in the middle of something very serious, yet their approach is one of na\u00efvet\u00e9 and/or ambivalence. While I was watching and settling into the fact that the movie wasn\u2019t exactly what the trailers advertised, I was reminded of The Last Detail or Out of Sight - both movies where characters find themselves in serious situations at various times and their responses are humorous and/or blunt and/or confused all while still being a thrilling experience. At times, the movie also had a bit of a free flowing/stream of consciousness feel like some of Linklater\u2019s work.</p> <p>I know the reviews (as well as many of you) likely",

Of course, watching it as a 7 year old I would wonder if I had a secret twin I\u2019d meet at summer camp. As a kid, I would think about how cool it\u2019d be to have a twin, what if I switched places with her, I wish I went to that summer camp, etc etc. Well, I\u2019m aware we should re-read things &amp; re-watch things years later to see how our perspective has changed &amp; it was so wild to watch as an adult in my 30\u2019s. I was curious about the Mom\u2019s point of view. What if my ex husband was engaged, but my daughters wanted me to work things out? Would I have gone on the camping trip? Was that a plan to break them up? Would I have kissed him in the wine cellar? Also, the ending when he did come after her when that\u2019s what she wanted before when younger, honestly made me cry because I was so happy for her. Just makes you think, thanks for reading!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; s",
