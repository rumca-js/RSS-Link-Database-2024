<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello hustlers,</p> <p>So basically we were working on another AI tool we developed. For marketing we researched various ad hooks and ran different types of ad campaigns. As a result we ended up with over 1,500 pre-tested ad templates, and that’s how we got the idea for our second product.</p> <p>Best things about our product are:<br/> - All templates are based on successful ads with high CTRs.<br/> - Templates are directly editable in Canva—no design experience needed!<br/> - The library is continuously updated to keep up with trends.<br/> - It’s cost-effective, as all templates are verified, saves you time too. </p> <p>The idea of this AI tool was just to make a collection of ad hooks for our own use. But it turned into a hooks library so we decided that it deserves to be shared with the world. 😂 </p> <p>You can try it out here: hookads.ai<a href="https://hookads.ai/">hookads.ai</a> Will be happy to hear your feedback!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone, I recently published a post on my blog composed of incomplete research about the cultural fingerprints embedded in the ethical frameworks of large language models in the US, China, and France. It’s fascinating how the cultural, political, and regulatory landscapes of each country shape the ethical guardrails for AI development.</p> <p>In the US, where freedom of expression and individual rights are highly valued, LLMs often emphasize privacy but struggle to address issues like bias, misinformation, and harmful content. The regulatory approach here tends to be reactive rather than proactive, focusing more on innovation than on regulation.</p> <p>In China, ethical guardrails are more about state control. AI models are heavily censored to align with the political agenda and to maintain social harmony. The government takes a central role in regulating these technologies, placing collective values and national security over individual freedo

Businesses compete with each other in the economy, and people compete for jobs. Nothing in life is guaranteed, but some people take jobs for granted. It&#39;s assumed that if you work hard you&#39;ll succeed, but that doesn&#39;t always happen. In a capitalist system, there is no reason why everyone who needs/wants a job should get one.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><strong>Little intro from my side:</strong></p> <p>I&#39;m a computer science student interested in AI and its application in financial markets. I&#39;ve been interested in trading for a long time, especially forex and commodities. I did the BabyPips course, but midway, I realized how much news influences the market than technical analysis (I’m leaning toward a more fundamentally driven perspective). Every time I see posts about people making money from event-driven trading, I think, &quot;I COULD DO THE SAME,&quot; but either I was unaware of the news due to my classes, I was sleeping or doing something else, or it was just too late to act on it.</p> <p>That’s when I explored algo trading. While it mainly focuses on numerical price patterns, it has a very limited scope for capturing sudden market shifts driven by social sentiment or breaking news.</p> <p>So now, I’m conceptualizing a system that continuously scrapes social media, using NLP and LLM-b

My long-term aspiration has been to work in medical AI, combining my knowledge in AI and computational neuroscience to contribute to healthcare innovation, whether in diagnostics, therapeutics, or personalised medicine.</p> <p>Initially, I thought pursuing a PhD was the natural next step, but after finishing my master’s, I feel a bit lost. I think I might need a break from academia and want to explore whether there’s an industry pathway to achieving this goal instead of committing to a PhD right away.</p> <p>Here are a few questions where I’d love some guidance: 1. Is a PhD essential to build a meaningful career in medical AI, or are there viable industry routes where I can grow into this field without one? 2. What kinds of entry-level roles or companies should I target
