Linus' old NAS is a hodgepodge of ancient drives, a very old CPU, and an extremely loud power supply. Also, it's actually 2 servers. Now it's finally time to replace them with awesome CD8 Enterprise drives from KIOXIA, a bunch of hard drives for even more storage, and a new power supply to quiet things down.
