Yesterday, SpaceX successfully launched four broadband satellites built by Astranis (YC W16), marking the first time a commercial manufacturer sent four of its own satellites to geostationary orbit (GEO) on a single mission.

Earlier this year, we visited Astranis' HQ for a behind-the-scenes look at how they did it, from a scrappy startup that began in an SF apartment to launching more satellites to GEO over the past two years than any other operator in the world.
