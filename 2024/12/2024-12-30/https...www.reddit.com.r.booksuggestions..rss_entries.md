<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have a friend (30sF) who is going through a tough time right now, which culminated last night in me having to talk her down off a figurative ledge. I’m doing my best to get her to seek real help, but I think she may be more responsive to start with reading a few books. Willing to try anything to help in the interim while I convince her to talk to a professional.</p> <p>Broad themes of what she’s struggling with are aging / not feeling like she’s accomplished anything, feeling behind her friends who are married / have kids (she’s single), finding purpose, and in my opinion, negative self-talk and not finding the good in herself or finding what fulfills her. </p> <p>Looking for books that touch on any of these themes. She’s not a very touchy-feely person so she’d respond well to a more straight forward tone. She also connects with personal anecdotes so memoirs are also on the table. For example, she enjoyed The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck.</p> <p

In the past couple of anime release seasons there have been some absolute bangers of shows, I&#39;m primarily talking about Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End and Delicious in Dungeon. I love the complexity of magical systems in Frieren along with the overarching goal of reaching Ende with very fleshed-out characters. Delicious in Dungeon is absolutely amazing in it&#39;s world-building and it&#39;s relevance to the plot. I also heard off of a YouTube channel that there&#39;s a third similar series called Witch-Hat Altier which uncovers the inner workings of social taboos regarding being a wizard and goes in depth in the actual creation of magic itself (runes, circles, etc) I really love these shows/series but I want to see if there&#39;s any book like them.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I just read The Shining by Stephen King and I loved it, for a very specific reason; I love the moments in the story where the characters slowly succumb to the thoughts that the hotel puts into their brain. Where Jack walks into the lounge and starts talking to ghosts and drinking from alcohol that never existed in the first place, where Wendy starts hearing big band music and dwells on how great the party is going, where Danny has his foreshadowing visions. I want to read a book that makes me feel like I’m also slowly losing my mind, rather than being worried about a slasher chasing me. Movies that give me a similar feel that I love are Inception, Shutter Island, and I also just love movies like About Time and Blade Runner 2049, if that helps. Doesn’t have to be purely horror whatsoever.

But the big thing that I&#39;m really looking for is older gay characters.</p> <p>Seems maybe weird, but I&#39;ve started to notice that a lot of recommendations for gay/lesbian romances tends to be in the YA genre, aka, very young adult characters. I myself have always preferred older characters and an older protagonist, so I&#39;m wondering if anyone could have some recommendations!</p> <p>Just to clarify, I&#39;m not looking for characters who&#39;s ages have been explicitly stated. I&#39;m just looking for characters who, more or less, don&#39;t feel like they&#39;re all 20 years old like many characters in YA novels do (and that&#39;s not a bad thing!

The family includes a father (who seems to be the protagonist), a mother, twin daughters, a son, and the mother’s mother.<br/> One by one, family members die due to a curse that seems connected to mysterious gifts they receive. Each gift comes with a ruin or a symbol written on strange paper, and once the paper is exposed to the elements, the recipient dies within a week.<br/> I remember specific tragic deaths: the son dies after being struck by lightning while chasing his dog during a thunderstorm; the mother dies when a sharp icicle (or some kind of ice) falls and pierces her eye; and the grandmother dies after being stung by bees while picking apples. </p> <p>The tone of the book is dark, mysterious, and tragic, with a focus on the curse

He’s isolated himself and lost many friends in the process.</p> <p>He listens to podcasts about adhd to navigate that, but often tells me that he lacks PURPOSE and he feels lost in life. He has lost who he is.</p> <p>It feels as if he thinks that everyone walks around with a purpose that is like a lighthouse guiding their way in life, and it’s always the answer to any question. It could probably be like that, but at the same time, does it have to be so grand?</p> <p>I’m looking for self help books, biographies, or anything that he could relate to in terms of finding a purpose and himself. </p> <p>I personally love Hermann Hesse’s both Demian and Siddhartha, but I think they’re too… heavy?</p> <p>So hopefully so
