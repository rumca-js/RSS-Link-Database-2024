<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey! I have never scraped anything and completely newb in this. I&#39;m interested in one specific subforum, which i want to turn into a personal RAG knowledge base on the subject. Quite fast i figured out it’s behind cloudflare defence and tried all sorts of tricks to pass it through, but haven’t had success yet. Still figuring out how to do it and what are my mistakes, but recently i started wondering, it it’s even possible without long period of learning inner mechanics of web, http, browsers and all that sort of stuff. So my question is: is it realistic for newbie to start scraping a forum behind cloudflare in reasonable time (week or so)? I’m not going to wreck their servers with requests, i’m ready for very slow pace of scraping, it’s ok to spend month or even more on this process, if it runs with minimum control from myself. There are ~20k pages of content that interests me. So, what are your thoughts?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted

I’m trying to find text on each of the web pages but because sometimes the text is an image.

## Scraping All Google Business Listings for a Specific Street

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey guys, </p> <p>I’m trying to gather all Google Business listings on specific streets. My process is pretty manual right now: I use the Maps Live View feature to navigate along the street, then enter the addresses into Proxi to organize them. It’s slow, and I’m sure there’s a more efficient way to do this.</p> <p>I know there’s a lot of software and services for scraping business data, but most are focused on lead scraping by vertical (e.g., restaurants, gyms, etc.), not by location like a specific street.</p> <p>My questions:</p> <ol> <li>Are there tools or methods anyone has used to automate this kind of task?</li> <li>If you were to outsource this, what kind of professional or freelancer would you hire? Would it be someone specializing in web scraping, a Python developer, or a different kind of expert?</li> </ol> <p>Thanks in advance.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/hjjjjjjjjjjjjjj"> /u/hjjj

Having a static list ordered from 0-100% would be awesome.</p> <p>Being able to easily generate a new list every few months would be helpful to put the newest movies on the list as well.</p> <p>Not sure if this is the place to ask but <a href="/r/movies">r/movies</a> sure isn&#39;t. </p> <p>There <em>is</em> a feature on JustWatch that apparently lets you search by specific percentage numbers, but it&#39;s a premium feature and I have no other reason to pay for that site so I won&#39;
