I\u2019ve been just testing a tool is called Follow that supports to subscribe multiple applications such as X(Twitter), and it\u2019s an open-sourced project in GitHub. <a href=\"https://github.com/RSSNext/Follow\">https://github.com/RSSNext/Follow</a> However, based my experience, I\u2019ve noticed some accounts, like Donald Trump\u2019s, shows errors about a month ago, and can\u2019t receive further updates. Furthermore, some YouTube Channels I followed, their RSS Feeds created by Follow directly through their original URLs seem that the images cannot be displayed correctly in their updates, while there\u2019s no such problem in the same channel\u2019s updates subscribed through the search bar found out. Unfortunately, I can&#39;t find most favorited Channels through the search bar... Has anyone else tested Follow&#39;s feature, or are there other tools that support multiple applications\u2019 subscriptions?",
