<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>TLDR: Run pglocklogger on your prod databases. Whenever there&#39;s an outage due to blocking in PostgreSQL, it may give you essential observability.</p> <p>Recently, I experienced a prod outage caused by a blocked migration.</p> <p>The migration itself was almost instantaneous, but it picks up a lock before it actually runs. That may take a while, but that&#39;s no problem, right? The migration runs a bit later, no worries.</p> <p>That&#39;s when I learned that an ALTER TABLE waiting on a lock, itself also blocks benign work that would otherwise run concurrently. So having your blocked ALTER TABLE can spiral into an application-wide outage quite easily.</p> <p>For example, a SELECT WITH UPDATE can run simultaneously with a SELECT, but not if an ALTER TABLE is executed in between. This is to prevent livelocks. A simple solution is to set a lock_timeout in your migrations, which causes the ALTER to fail early and allow all other work to continue. Then
