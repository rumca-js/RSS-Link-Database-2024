We're tearing apart the Intel Battlemage B580 video card in this video, featuring Intel's new Arc GPU. The B580 'Limited Edition' card from Intel is on the modmat today, getting torn down for inspection into its assembly quality after the nightmarish assembly of the original Arc A770 and A750 GPUs. Intel has improved in huge ways with this much simpler, more "boring" (in a good way) video card design.

Watch our original tear-down of the A770 -- or just read the comments, because they're hilarious: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N371iMe_nfA
