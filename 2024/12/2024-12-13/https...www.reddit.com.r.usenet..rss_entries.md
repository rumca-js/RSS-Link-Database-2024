<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Over the last few months I have noticed a lot of downloads failing and getting errors about missing articles or that the media does not exist on the server. I can still get some downloads to work, but for example, one new series fails every episode and it seems like anything over a few months fails too. I have Demon as primary and blocknews as the backup.</p> <p>All server tests work as expected since some downloads work.</p> <p>Deleted all servers, restarted and added them back- no change.</p> <p>How can I fix this?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/djdanko1"> /u/djdanko1 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1hdhynu/did_something_change_with_geek_or_is_my_config/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1hdhynu/did_something_change_with_geek_or_is_my_config/">[comments]</a></span>
