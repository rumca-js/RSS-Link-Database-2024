<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been looking through both the mega thread and some tutorials, but they all have the assumption that, even if I&#39;m brand new to piracy, that I know a decent amount about technology. Like, just a few minutes ago I had no idea about my mac&#39;s terminal and was tearing my hair out trying to figure out what the guide I was looking at meant (still trying to download SpotX lol), so I&#39;m clearly deeply tech illiterate. </p> <p>Going through this sub feels like I&#39;m a third grader that was given a scientific journal by a master in the field to peer review. I am very very small and also dumb and maybe even stupid too.
