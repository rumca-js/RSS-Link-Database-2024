Research suggests Earth’s inner core, a metal sphere within the molten outer core, is slowing its spin and reshaping. Seismic wave analyses from earthquakes reveal discrepancies indicating deformation on the core’s surface or changes in rotation. John Vidale, a geophysicist from the University of Southern California, presented these findings, shedding light on potential interactions with Earth's mantle and outer core.

NASA’s Hubble Telescope has tracked atmospheric and seasonal changes on Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune over ten years. Key findings include shifts in Jupiter’s Great Red Spot, Saturn’s seasonal phenomena, Uranus’ polar brightness, and Neptune’s storm activity. These insights, part of NASA’s Outer Planet Atmospheres Legacy (OPAL) program, offer a deeper understanding of gas giants' dynamics and have contributed to over 60 scientific studies. The data underscores the value of long-term planetary observation programs.

A new study proposes a potential solution to the long-standing black hole information paradox, suggesting that black holes might leak information through gravitational waves. Researchers at the California Institute of Technology have explored how quantum nonlocality could connect the interior of a black hole with its exterior. This connection would allow information to escape through subtle space-time ripples generated during black hole mergers. These ripples, embedded in gravitational waves, could hold the missing information, offering a resolution to Stephen Hawking’s original paradox. While current gravitational wave detectors like LIGO and Virgo lack the sensitivity to confirm these patterns, upcoming next-generation detectors could potentially test these findings.

The James Webb Space Telescope has identified dozens of Jupiter-mass binary objects (JuMBOs) in the Orion Nebula. These enigmatic rogue gas giant pairs orbit each other at distances of 25 to 400 AU. Researchers propose they could be failed stars formed under extreme radiation conditions, ejected planetary systems, or a mix of both. Simulations replicate the JuMBOs' traits, supporting the theory that high-energy radiation compresses pre-stellar cores to create these objects. Further studies in other star-forming regions are planned to validate these findings.
