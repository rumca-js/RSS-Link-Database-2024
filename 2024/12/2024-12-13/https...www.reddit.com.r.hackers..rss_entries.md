<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>My case is probably pretty simple.</p> <p>There is someone repeatedly creating fake accounts on linkedin and adding me. I block it, but then the next day there’s a new fake account with similar or equal name asking for connection.</p> <p>This has been going on for days and now the persistence of this person is starting to worry me. Who the hell is taking so much time doing this and why?</p> <p>My question: how can I find the email and other info that this person is using to create the accounts?</p> <p>The contact information is not publicly available on the profiles and I’ve already tried Lusha and Rocket Reach to no avail.</p> <p>Can somebody help me? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Far-Accountant7904"> /u/Far-Accountant7904 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hackers/comments/1hd59xm/how_to_uncover_a_fake_linkedin_account/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.redd
