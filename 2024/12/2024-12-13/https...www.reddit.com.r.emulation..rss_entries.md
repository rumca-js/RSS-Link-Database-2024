## Question About Streaming ROMs and Copyright Laws

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I already know that owning a physical copy of a game and converting it into a ROM is legal. However, I’ve been wondering about the implications of streaming. If I were to stream myself playing a ROM without mentioning that I’m using an emulator on Steam, would anyone be able to tell? Should I avoid streaming a pirated ROM, or can I take the risk without facing penalties? The games I&#39;m mainly referring to are from NES, GBA, and Sega consoles.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Mr_smil3y69"> /u/Mr_smil3y69 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emulation/comments/1hd9jaq/question_about_streaming_roms_and_copyright_laws/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emulation/comments/1hd9jaq/question_about_streaming_roms_and_copyright_laws/">[comments]</a></span>
