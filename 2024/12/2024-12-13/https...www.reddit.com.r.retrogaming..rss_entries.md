## KICKMASTER 1992 on NES must be one of the biggest suprises i ever had on the NES. Amazing graphics, great soundtrack, amazing cutscenes, it has that NINJA GAIDEN flair to it and oh my gosh the amazing bosses and so many moves. I honestly adore this game and btw, dude looks like DAVID CARRADINE here.

It is ok nothing special but then i thought before i spent 140 for the retrotink 2x pro, because i need my scanlines, check your mcbazel scanline generator out. I already bought one for my pandoras box long time ago (it works great here or for the snk mini arcade thing).</p> <p>So my idea was N64 &gt;&gt; retro upscaler 2x &gt;&gt; hdmi scanline generator. The problem: i get no Signal. Im not sure if the mcbazel scanline generator expect 1080p? But i read in old posts/threads that some people had a similar setup. Do i something wrong? Is it the N64 input? I also doesnt work with the gamecube.</p> <p>The HDMI Scanline Generator <a href="https://www.amazon.de/Mcbazel-Scanline-Generator-Tragbare-Emulator-HDMI/dp/B078ZFD774">https://www.amazon.de/Mcbazel-Scanline-Generator-Tragbare-Emulator-HDMI/dp/B078ZFD774</a></p> <p>Bewinn

My head was tooting along to the double dragon music before I knew it, I knew the moves to jump fore down on operation c and iv not played it in 30 years!</p> <p>And these games are not easy, not forgiving, game over is game over start again. My 12 year old self must have spent hours and hours drilling these games.</p> <p>And that&#39;s when the weirdness set in. I felt a bit like I was 12 again, like I was in my parents house again on the sofa. Thoughts of school and 90s tv flood back, memories i had not remembered. I didn&#39;t have a terrible terrible childhood but there was some trauma there at times. I think during some of it I must have been playing or used my gameboy as an escape from it because some of those fee

I&#39;m a few years younger than him (he is now 45) and was completely unaware of this cultural moment. He actually still has his original NES and it works like a charm.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi, I discovered a retro Game box console. For me, as a fan of retro games, this is a great opportunity to play multiple platforms in one box. I found many versions, from g5, g10, g11, g12, g13, g13pro, game box x+. Many manufacturers offer more or less games in the same version. I understand that this depends on the memory card, but even if the size of the card matches, some sellers list 20,000 games, others up to 60,000. Is this just a marketing ploy, or are there versions from different manufacturers that really offer 60,000 games, while I understand there are a lot of games cloned, but every extra game counts. I would like to have the most games already in the base, without unnecessary downloading and saving to the library. I would also like to know how it is with the versions and with the response of the drivers or with other problems. Does anyone have experience with this? Thanks for the advice Sorry for my english </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#3
