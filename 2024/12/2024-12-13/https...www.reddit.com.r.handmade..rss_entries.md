I am making this ornament which is a Scottie dog that I made out of air dry clay and his green coat. </p> <p>I somehow thought that leaving the tin foil armature exposed on his back would give me a better surface to glue his green dog coat onto (it’s felt with some quilt wadding stuff to make it feel a bit soft)</p> <p>I thought a glue gun would make the quilt wadding stick to the foil - it didn’t stick at all. Next tried mod podge, it didn’t stick.</p> <p>Is quilt wadding just an awkward material that isn’t going to stick, or was my mistake the tin foil? </p> <p>I can put air dry clay on top of the foil and try sticking to that? I don’t know, any suggestion greatly
