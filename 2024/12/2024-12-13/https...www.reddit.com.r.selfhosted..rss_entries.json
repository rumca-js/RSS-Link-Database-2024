For about 3 years, I have been using the following setup as my home server:</p> <ol> <li>An ARM64 based QNAP NAS 25TB with only 2 GBs of RAM as my basic storage solution via NFS shares and SMB.</li> <li>A Rpi4 8GB (OS on a USB3 SSD) headless with Docker and several applications as containers (Caddy, Emby, 3 Instances of Radarr, Sonarr, Bazarr, Home Assistant, Ubooquity, Immich plus more).</li> </ol> <p>It was time for an upgrade, so a Rpi5 8GB is on the way. My initial plan was to simply replace the Rpi4, but I started to think it would be more fun to use both raspberries and even the NAS itself (running docker) as a cluster!</p> <p>I have never been so deep with dockers connected to each other or kubernetes/kos/k3s etc. but I am always ready to learn more!</p> <p>What do you think?

The ultimate goal is to manage Docker VMs in Proxmox and use Docker volumes to host the folders of the services I use.</p> <p>The problem I currently have is with Jellyfin, Sonarr, Radar and Prowlarr. If I use docker volumes for these containers, it is extremely slow to import movies and tv series. Also, it&#39;s very slow when I search Sonarr or Radarr to display files available through Prowlarr.</p> <p>A temporary solution I found is to not use NFS share for the /config folder on most containers. So they are hosted directly on the VM instead of on TrueNAS. It is very fast to perform the same tasks. Since the VMs on Proxmox run on SSDs, I was wondering if having 2-3 SSDs on TrueNAS to manage the containers&#39; /config folders could improve performance even if they are on NFS share or it is completely irrelevant.</p> <p>If po",
