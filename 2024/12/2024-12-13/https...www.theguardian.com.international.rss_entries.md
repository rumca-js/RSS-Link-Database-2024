<p>Seen as a controversial nominee, Patel is acquiring senate judiciary committee support for confirmation</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>’s nominee for FBI director, Kash Patel, has broadly locked down support from Republicans on the Senate judiciary committee, paving the way for his confirmation to the role after the current director announced his <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/11/fbi-director-christopher-wray-resign">intention to resign</a> when the president-elect takes office in January.</p><p>The idea of securing support from the judiciary committee, according to two people familiar with the matter, is that if the committee reports out his nomination perhaps unanimously, it would make it politically harder for any skeptical Republicans to oppose him later.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/13/fbi-kash-patel-senate-support">Continue reading...</a>

<p>It was a mixed round for Europe’s biggest clubs. We hand out honours and dishonours from the latest round of action</p><p><strong>Real Madrid:</strong> Are the serial champions finally stirring? The holders have been sleepy and tetchy amid the new format as the problems of assimilating Kylian Mbappé play out in public. But in a vital 3-2 away win over Atalanta, Mbappé played his part, scoring a fine goal before leaving with an injury. That left the stage open for Real’s other modern Galácticos, with Vinícius Júnior and Jude Bellingham scoring the goals that took the game away from last season’s Europa League winners. Mateo Retegui’s late effort had Madrid’s hearts thumping but it flew wide, and was probably offside anyway. To automatically qualify in a top-eight place Madrid need to rediscover the belief that winning games at this level is their right. Their final two assignments, against Salzburg and Brest, look very winnable, although Real sit 20th, four points off the automatic
