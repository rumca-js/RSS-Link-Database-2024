I have a personal tradition of reading books set in countries when I travel to them, and I&#39;d like to try and get initiated in that tradition by gifting her something she&#39;d like that&#39;s set there. Are there any books about / set in Greece or Greek Mythology (she really likes greek mythology) that you think a middle-aged person would appreciate? Bonus points if Crete, but no biggie. </p> <p>Fiction, non-fiction, it&#39;s all good, any suggestion will do :) Just not something too racy (I considered <em>Song of Achilles</em> but although she&#39;s an ally I think that&#39;d be a bit too much for her already) or &quot;abstract&quot; (I also thought of <em>Outline</em> by Rachel Cusk), but she&#39;d probably already get confused by its format)</p> <p>Thank you in advance!</p> </div

The only issue here is, I don’t really know what book I could use for this gift, I’m wondering if some of you could give me some suggestions. For some context, we have been very close since middle school but things haven’t always been good between us.
