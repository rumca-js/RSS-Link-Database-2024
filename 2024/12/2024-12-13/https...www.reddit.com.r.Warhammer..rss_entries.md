<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Posted a while back about potentially buying husband an airbrush for Xmas and I got so much excellent advice that gave me a lot to think about. </p> <p>In the end (and after some light investigative work with the husband) I nixed the airbrush and I&#39;ve ended up getting him some Artis Opus D and M brushes, some Vallejo paints and a better hobby light.</p> <p>I actually cocked it as I was supposed to order the S series but I ordered them literally as soon as I woke up on payday and I don&#39;t think I was fully conscious. I still think they&#39;re a good addition to his paintbrush arsenal but he might get the S series for our anniversary as his everyday brushes are starting to be a bit past their prime 😅</p> <p>Anyway, it was just to say - I really did get some great advice, so thanks for being such a knowledgeable, kind and supportive community 😊</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/raechiibbz"> /u/

Titus was seemingly sent to die just moments after doing everything he had done in SM2.
