<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Given Ubuntu&#39;s pivotal role in making Linux more accessible to the general public, why has it not seen wider adoption across desktop and enterprise markets, especially considering its user-friendly interface, strong community support, and vast software ecosystem? What factors might be preventing it from becoming a more dominant player in comparison to other operating systems like Windows or macOS?</p> <p>Also I&#39;ve been seeing decline in Linux users in who are on Ubuntu?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I know that there are tons of Minesweeper like games for Linux but most of them are not exactly like classic Windows Minesweeper that I enjoyed playing years ago so I decided to write my own in C++ with SDL2 and few other things.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been a dedicated Linux user for about four years now, and I absolutely love it. I can&#39;t imagine going back to Windows. As someone who considers themselves an experienced Linux user, I want to share my perspective on what an ideal Linux distribution for the average PC user should look like—designed not for tech enthusiasts but for regular students, workers, and everyday people.</p> <p>Linux is truly remarkable, offering:</p> <ul> <li>Freedom</li> <li>Customizability</li> <li>The ability to modify or replace any part of the system</li> <li>Independence from proprietary services, allowing users to choose their preferred package manager, desktop environment, and more</li> </ul> <p>However, these strengths can sometimes become weaknesses. Don’t get me wrong—these are fantastic advantages for those who enjoy tinkering and fine-tuning their system. But for the average user, the priority is simply to boot up and use their computer without worryi

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello everyone,</p> <p>I have a question regarding dual-booting. I have two SSDs in my laptop—one primarily dedicated to Windows and the other for my data and games. I want to dual-boot Kali Linux by creating a partition on the second SSD.</p> <p>However, I’ve heard that the Windows bootloader might override the GRUB bootloader, potentially making Kali inaccessible. My question is: can we install the GRUB bootloader on the second SSD (if such an option exists) so that both Windows and Kali remain unaffected?</p> <p>Currently, I use a Kali VM for my tasks, but it feels limiting due to fewer customization options and certain restrictions. That’s why I want to dual-boot Kali with Windows 11.</p> <p>Please share your insights or suggestions—it would be a great help!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/EstimateJealousHigh"> /u/EstimateJealousHigh </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/co
