<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>The Stormlight Archive and The Kingkiller Chronicle are my favourite series. I haven&#39;t read any other big fantasy series, but I&#39;ve watched LOTR/The Hobbit and GOT so don&#39;t feel motivated to read them.</p> <p>The one series I&#39;ve tried to read recently, as I had seen it recommended online frequently, was Realm of the Elderlings. My problem with RotE is Hobb&#39;s writing style. It is too complex and descriptive for me. I generally liked the setting and the world-building in the beginning of Fits&#39; story, but the elaborate writing lead to my attention slipping away very often, forcing me to reread the page and frustrating me after some time.</p> <p>On the other hand, Sanderson&#39;s and Rothfuss&#39;s writing was such a smooth experience that on some days I managed to read up to 200 pages, which is a lot for me since I usually read 50 pages a day.</p> <p>Maybe I will get back to RotE someday, but currently I&#39;d like to find some ne

## The Liveship Traders series is superior to the Fitz novels.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>That series was often legitimately very dark, violent, and grim in tone. There was some silliness, sure, but overall, it had a nice tone of bleakness with a fundamental optimism at its heart. </p> <p>It is confusing to me that his epic fantasy series, which is supposed to be even more mature in tone than Mistborn, is getting progressively more juvenile and crass in its tone and sense of humor. They are still fundamentally enjoyable books, but the seriousness of what&#39;s going on in the plot is often undermined by humor about feces, farts, extremely sanitized middle school sex jokes. </p> <p>It&#39;s just a really jarring clash with the narrative and plight of the characters. Does it need to be dark to be good epic fantasy? No. But I really don&#39;t know of any other epic fantasy series that has this kind of middle grade humor so pervasive throughout.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Regular_Bee

I regretted my original thought both because a dragon is a magical creature and doesn&#39;t necessarily follow traditional rules for animal anatomy, and also because I believed that I had somehow spiritually motivated someone to create those items without ever having met me. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Anxious-Repeat-191"> /u/Anxious-Repeat-191 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1hdm575/anatomically_correct_dragons/">[link]</a></sp

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>The best description I can come up with for this book is “dark <em>Alice in Wonderland</em>, with themes of intergenerational trauma and bodily autonomy.”</p> <p>The protagonist of this book is Gemma, who lives with her antique-shop-owner mother Virginia (Gigi). Their home/store is next to a “little strip of woods” in their small Michigan hometown, which Gemma and Gigi know is also a vast, ancient, dark fairy forest. At least Gigi knows something about it; what Gemma knows is that her mother is very, very clear with her that there are monsters in the woods, and Gemma must never, ever go into them.</p> <p>Gemma, being a kid, ignores this warning. In fact, being a kid, she takes every opportunity to go into the woods precisely <em>because</em> of this warning. She sometimes encounters scary things, but she also encounters things like fairy princes that make her question her mother’s insistent warnings. Luckily (depending on your point of view) Gigi is

One of life’s few consolations for Marek is his enduring bond with the blind village midwife, Ina, who suckled him as a baby, as she did so many of the village’s children. Ina’s gifts extend beyond childcare: she possesses a unique ability to communicate with the natural world. Her gift often brings her the transmission of sacred knowledge on levels far beyond those available to other villagers, however religious they might be. For some people, Ina’s home in the woods outside of the village is a place to fear and to avoid, a godless place. </p> <p>Among their nu

A few years back, I got about as far as 1/3 of Oathbringer before getting distracted by other books, video games and work. So now it&#39;s my 3rd time reading WoK and I&#39;m enjoying it more than ever before. I&#39;m noticing little details and foreshadowing (especially with Shallan) that I did not see before. Also you gotta appreciate how well Sanderson does the opening novel in a series. Similarity to WoT&#39;s Eye of the World, Way of Kings is a masterfully crafted serie debut that is very good at setting up all the major, and many minor, characters and getting the readers fully invested and immersed in the world. And doing all this without major info dumps. World-building is Sanderson&#39;s game, and it&#39;s more apparent than ever in Way of Kings.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/crusadertsar"> /u/crusadertsar </a> <br/> <span><a href="htt

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Almost everyone I know loved the first few books of the Stormlight Archive. I still really liked the third, although it had some flaws. The fourth book spent a lot of time away from the characters we’d already grown to love, and while it was still a good book, it suffered from that. I still liked it, but less so, and I know several ardent fans of the Stormlight Archive who were very disappointed by it.</p> <p><strong>The good news:</strong> the fifth book spends <em>plenty</em> of time with characters we love already. There are some really clever twists and some surprising – but well-foreshadowed – reveals. A lot of plot threads get satisfying resolutions, and the series continues to develop its focus on mental health themes in a meaningful way.</p> <p><strong>However, if book one was a brisk hike through a hilly countryside, book five is a straight-up mountain climb.</strong> This book takes <em>effort</em> to read and follow. There are more than te

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Just finished The Mask of Mirrors and while I enjoyed all the lies, gossip, scheming, and manipulation, the lore and magic went way over my head so I dont think I&#39;ll be able to continue the series.</p> <p>The main thing I loved was how every piece of dialogue holds tension because of the possibility of being out-manoeuvred or getting caught in a lie. Plus pettiness and gossip between nobles Imao. And major power moves.</p> <p>Any suggestions that contain a female lead and MINIMAL/no romance? I don&#39;t mind if there&#39;s romance between side characters.</p> <p>Bonus points if the main character if the character isn&#39;t a major player but is learning the game, or if there&#39;s a con involved like MoM and Mistborn!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/thanoshalpert"> /u/thanoshalpert </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1hd2503/books_with_court_politics_scheming_a

## Humor in books vs audio books.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I have seen a lot of talk on here. Talking about Sanderson humor and books not being funny. I always thought that was kind of odd as I typical enjoyed how he wrote shallan and lift two characters people found annoying. I never thought they where the funniest character ever but they where enjoyable and humor was okay at worst and great at best. I think these jokes landed for me is I’m primarily an audible listener. I have a reading disability so although I do enjoy reading I have found that I often listen to a series first and then will go back and reread it or read the second book in a series. As it takes me a longer time to read a series than listen to it.</p> <p>While listening to a series I feel like Kate Reading does a great job when it comes to humor. Shallan jokes come off as corky word play that people chuckle at not some amazingly witty joke that people are dying laughing at. Lift sounds like a hyper active kid which helps when she screams

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;d love to meet more well know authors for book signings and panels. I&#39;ve gone to cons for a while but rarely see authors there. Dragonsteel has been the welcome exception.</p> <p>What is really like to know is how I can identify when/where authors are attending an event nearby.
