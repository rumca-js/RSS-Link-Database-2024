<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Since NNW doesn’t support adding external links from outside the app to save for later or mark as starred, I’m curious about what solutions you guys use for saving things you want to revisit later.</p> <p>Currently, I use Safari’s Reading List, which works okay, but it’s a bit too tucked away, so I often forget to check it.</p> <p>I also prefer keeping my apps to a minimum, so while using something like Goodlinks, Pocket, or Reader could work, it’s not the ideal solution for me.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Ill_Connection_3017"> /u/Ill_Connection_3017 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1hd84zl/newnewswire_users_how_do_you_save_external/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1hd84zl/newnewswire_users_how_do_you_save_external/">[comments]</a></span>
