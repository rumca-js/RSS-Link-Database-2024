It is ok nothing special but then i thought before i spent 140 for the retrotink 2x pro, because i need my scanlines, check your mcbazel scanline generator out. I already bought one for my pandoras box long time ago (it works great here or for the snk mini arcade thing).</p> <p>So my idea was N64 &gt;&gt; retro upscaler 2x &gt;&gt; hdmi scanline generator. The problem: i get no Signal. Im not sure if the mcbazel scanline generator expect 1080p? But i read in old posts/threads that some people had a similar setup. Do i something wrong? Is it the N64 input? I also doesnt work with the gamecube.</p> <p>The HDMI Scanline Generator <a href=\"https://www.amazon.de/Mcbazel-Scanline-Generator-Tragbare-Emulator-HDMI/dp/B078ZFD774\">https://www.amazon.de/Mcbazel-Scanline-Generator-Tragbare-Emulator-HDMI/dp/B078ZFD774</a></p> <p>Bewinn",

It looks better and has 2 player co-op. It is harder than the NES version, but you get unlimited continues except at the final stage. But there&#39;s an easy to do in-game cheat that will give you unlimited continues so it is definitely beatable in one sitting. This version was developed by Sega so its quite interesting.

For me, as a fan of retro games, this is a great opportunity to play multiple platforms in one box. I found many versions, from g5, g10, g11, g12, g13, g13pro, game box x+. Many manufacturers offer more or less games in the same version. I understand that this depends on the memory card, but even if the size of the card matches, some sellers list 20,000 games, others up to 60,000. Is this just a marketing ploy, or are there versions from different manufacturers that really offer 60,000 games, while I understand there are a lot of games cloned, but every extra game counts. I would like to have the most games already in the base, without unnecessary downloading and saving to the library. I would also like to know how it is with the versions and with the response of the drivers or with other problems. Does anyone have experience with this? Thanks for the advice Sorry for my english </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#3",
