Watch our IGN Delta Force review by Justin Koreis on PC.

Delta Force isn’t the best extraction shooter, nor does it do big PvP battles better than games you probably already own. However, doing both of those modes reasonably well in one free-to-play package is pretty noteworthy. The massive, vehicle-filled battles are respectable fun – especially in Attack and Defend – as long as you can get comfortable with the more realistic shooting mechanics and how they mix with fantastical powers. The Operations mode, meanwhile, makes for one of the most formulaic and accessible extraction shooters I’ve played, though the great levels are wasted on too much direction toward the only worthwhile loot. Still, it’s a good option for either way you want to play, and deserves credit for doing a solid, if unspectacular and not especially imaginative job of two very different first-person shooter styles.

It started, of course, with J.R.R. Tolkien’s epic fantasy books, The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. Adaptations followed over the years, first on radio, then in animation, before Peter Jackson finally brought the realm of Middle-earth to a worldwide audience with his acclaimed LOTR trilogy. Since then, the adaptations have continued, with the newest take being an anime-style film that peers into a previously untold chapter of Tolkien’s world: The War of the Rohirrim.

Coming from Jackson trilogy co-writer Philippa Boyens and studio New Line, The War of the Rohirrim dives into Tokien’s Lord of the Rings appendices to fill in some of the gaps of Middle-earth history. But it also is very clearly set in the Peter Jackson version of Tolkien’s fantasy world.

We talked to Boyens and producer Jason DeMarco about how they cracked the code on telling a brand new Lord of the Rings story while managing to stay true not just to Tolkien, but to Peter Jackson too. The pair also spoke about what
