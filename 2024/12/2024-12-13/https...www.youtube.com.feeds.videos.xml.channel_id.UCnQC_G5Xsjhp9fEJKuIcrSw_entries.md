Biden is racing to auction off parts of the border wall before they can be utilized. Ben discusses Trump‚Äôs expected plan to use an executive order to restart construction almost immediately once he takes office. He also talks about NATO chief Mark Rutte‚Äôs recent press conference, during which he says it‚Äôs time to shift to a wartime mindset. Trump believes Europe should take the lead with the war in Ukraine and says he wants to see a strong, well-armed Ukraine emerge from a cessation of fighting. Ben also discusses the DOJ‚Äôs report, which reveals the FBI‚Äôs lack of canvassing and preparation before January 6th.

Dr. Kevin Roberts is the President of The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank that plays a central role in hosting national public policy debates among the political right. In his new book, ‚ÄúDawn‚Äôs Early Light,‚Äù Roberts offers a diagnosis of America‚Äôs most urgent problems, as well as a series of policy prescriptions for a more prosperous future. In this episode of The Sunday Special, Kevin discusses the tradeoffs inherent to policymaking, why Republicans must not neglect fiscal conservatism any longer, and which executive agency he would reform first. Roberts also injects nuance into our foreign policy debates and explains why some institutions are not even worth overhauling. Stay tuned, and welcome back to another episode of The Sunday Special.

Joe Biden is still wildly unpopular and will be leaving office in infamy. Only 2 in 10 Americans approve of him pardoning his son. Ben discusses Bill Clinton‚Äôs latest interview, where he states that the Trump administration made up Hillary‚Äôs classified email claims, yet goes on to say that maybe he should talk to Biden about a preemptive pardon for Hillary. Ben also talks about the recent good news for Republicans. The 5th Circuit stated that the SEC‚Äôs policy for NASDAQ is a violation of the law, and their adversity mandate is a joke. Lastly, he talks about Justin Trudeau bashing Americans for not electing Hillary or Kamala.
