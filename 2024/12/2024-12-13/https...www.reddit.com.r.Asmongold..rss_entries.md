Sven, one of the creators of Baulder&#39;s Gate 3, one of the best games in literally years renown by people across the gaming world? Bad, mid, L, etc. Meanwhile a trailer with 0 gameplay and a mediocre looking cinematic from the creators of DNF (Dungeon and Fighter) with a guy yelling and killing monsters almost got more praise than the actual POE2 gameplay trailer. I had to get that off my chest, because its hard to ignore almost a quarter of the screen of people spamming. His chat is literally becoming the definition of NPC responses.</p> <p>This is most likely going to get a lot hate, but how about you don&#39;t knee jerk so hard you knock yourself over and hurt what little brain power you have left.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Z

## CDPR said not so long ago that the new Witcher will not be The Witcher 4. And yet, they announce The Witcher 4. I was hyped about Ciri being the main focus, but i feel it's gonna be one of those "teachable" moments where you need to do push ups if you misgender someone. Hope i am wrong.
