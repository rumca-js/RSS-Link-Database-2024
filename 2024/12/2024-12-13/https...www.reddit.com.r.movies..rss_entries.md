<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all,</p> <p>Not sure if this is appropriate for this sub, but I was watching some classics this week and was noticing some performances that I really loved where the actor was only on screen for a very short time. </p> <ul> <li>Elmo Blatch from Shawshank Redemption - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xB8016CS8bU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xB8016CS8bU</a> This guy just manages to come across as totally evil and remorseless in like 45 seconds of screen time.</li> <li>Shrimp boat guy from Forrest Gump - <a href="https://youtu.be/Wg-gYbp3mAM?t=40">https://youtu.be/Wg-gYbp3mAM?t=40</a> This guy only has a couple of lines, but he always makes me smile, and he absolutely feels like exactly the sort of character you&#39;d meet on a dock.</li> <li>Vincent Grey from Sixth Sense. Struggling to find a good link, but MAN Donnie Wahlberg just CRUSHES this character in around 1 min of screen time. What a powerful scene to start that movie.</li> </ul

## The lighting in Easy A (2010) is so freaking good.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I was watching Easy A on Netflix and aside from being one of the best comedies of the 2010&#39;s I can&#39;t help but notice how exceptional the lighting is. It really brings that essential warmth and sunny brightness of California that I miss seeing in movies to the full front and it looks so natural to the eye. Maybe I&#39;m glazing it but I just miss that type of quality lighting in movies. The type of lighting that can something simple like a parking lot or a teenager&#39;s room look really cinematic and alive. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Legitimate-Fee3883"> /u/Legitimate-Fee3883 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hdhcy1/the_lighting_in_easy_a_2010_is_so_freaking_good/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hdhcy1/the_lighting_in_easy_a_2010_is_so_freaking_good/">[comments]</a></span>

## Depictions that were considered historically or scientifically accurate at the time, but not anymore due to later discoveries

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Movies don&#39;t always strive for historical or scientific accuracy, but sometimes they do, only for new information to emerge later that changes the academic consensus and it turns out it wasn&#39;t actually accurate after all.</p> <p>For example, back in the day, historians mostly accepted that the Titanic sank whole (some witnesses had insisted that it had split in two though, but it was dark and hard to see so their testimonies were considered unreliable). As such, movies used to depict it sinking in one piece. But in 1985, the wreckage of the Titanic was discovered and it was proven that the Titanic had split in two, and as such movies released afterwards, especially the James Cameron movie, have depicted sinking it accurately.</p> <p>The public perception of dinosaurs mostly comes from what we&#39;ve seen in movies, and a lot of it is because of Jurassic Park . The dinosaurs in Jurassic Park mostly looked like what scientists thought that dino

## The filmmakers who are taking inspirations from "Die Hard" seems to be forgetting something, especially with regards to the main character.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have seen the trailer &quot;Cleaner&quot; starring Daisy Ridley and it seems that the filmmakers have taken cues from the film &quot;Die Hard&quot;. However, I&#39;ve noticed something when others are taking inspirations from the said film. John McLane is basically a normal cop who is just trying to fix his marriage to his wife who is working in the building that he came in. When the hostage ensues and his wife is one of those hostages, he was forced to take action. Yes, he beat some of the bad guys, but he&#39;s hurt and bloodied a lot (and almost half-naked to say the least), and on the verge of giving up (he knows he&#39;s gonna die but he&#39;s afraid of it). These are the reasons why I loved this character. He&#39;s vulnerable but he&#39;s determined to his job especially when he has to save his wife. Films inspired by &quot;Die Hard&quot; are pretty entertaining in terms of action but they don&#39;t have the main character that we supposed to

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Just watched Kubo and the Two Strings, a masterpiece from Laika – the stop-motion studio that gave us Coraline, Paranorman and Missing Link. I can’t believe this movie is real. I’m watching behind the scenes videos in awe of how the characters we see were indeed physical figures whose limbs were moved a fraction of a fraction of an inch by the animators.</p> <p>Stop motion is insane by itself, but if we look at the works from Aardman - the creators of “Chicken Run” and “Wallace &amp; Gromit” (which I love, btw) – we can see the movements are not as fluid, and that’s part of their charm. Not to mention the LEGO movies, whose characters are stiff by nature. Kubo’s characters, on the other hand, are so fluid they look like CGI. (In fact, they used a lot of CGI for the backgrounds, and the movie was nominated for a VFX Oscar - the only animated film besides Nightmare Before Christmas to get this distinction.)</p> <p>Also stop motion characters are usuall
