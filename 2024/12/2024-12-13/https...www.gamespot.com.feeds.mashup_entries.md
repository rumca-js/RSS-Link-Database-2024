<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sunderfolk/">Sunderfolk</a>, a four-player co-op turn-based RPG, is looking like the next game to encourage folks to experience the joy of tabletop games. It sees players fight together through a story where every NPC and player choice is narrated by a game master, allowing a group of friends to party up for weekly game nights to play through a campaign together. Sunderfolk doesn't offer the same level of narrative freedom as a game like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/baldurs-gate-3/">Baldur's Gate 3</a> (or playing an actual tabletop game with a real person as the game master); instead, it honors binary choices in a curated narrative. Even if that means Sunderfolk's game master is technically always railroading the players (a major faux pas in the tabletop community), I still think this feature sounds incredibly cool, potentially doing enough to still emulate what it's like to play in a story-driven tabletop campaign with your frie

<p>The Call of Duty franchise in recent years has been known for its totally over-the-top skins, operators, and finishing moves, and the newest one for Black Ops 6 and Warzone might top them all.</p><p>The upcoming Brightmare Tracer Pack is themed around unicorns, and the finishing move--called "Refraction Action"--spawns a unicorn who emits a deadly rainbow fart to take down your enemy.

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/path-of-exile-2/">Path of Exile 2 </a>features a wide variety of small items that can make a huge impact on your character. From Orbs of Augmentation to runes for every element, these items provide small or large buffs to different aspects of your gear. Of course, the best way to upgrade your gear is to simply increase its rarity. Orbs of Transmutation allow you to change a normal item into a magic item, which is what you'll do with some gear pieces at the start of Path of Exile 2. However, once you get into the mid and late-game, you'll want to use Regal Orbs, changing your magic items into rare items.</p><h2>How to find Regal Orbs in Path of Exile 2</h2><p>There are two ways to acquire a Regal Orb in Path of Exile 2. The first is the most straightforward method: Loot it from an enemy or chest. Like all other items in the game, Regal Orbs have the chance to drop as loot after you kill an enemy or boss, or when you loot a chest.</p><p>As Reg
