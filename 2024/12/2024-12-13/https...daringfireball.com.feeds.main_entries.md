<p>Federico Viticci, writing at MacStories “<a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/apple-intelligence-and-chatgpt-in-18-2/">Apple Intelligence in iOS 18.2: A Deep Dive into Working with Siri and ChatGPT, Together</a>”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In testing the updated Writing Tools with ChatGPT integration,
I’ve run into some limitations that I will cover below, but I also
had two <em>very</em> positive experiences with the Notes app that I want
to mention here since they should give you an idea of what’s
possible.</p>

<p>In my first test, I was working with a note that contained a list
of payments for my work at MacStories and Relay FM, plus the
amount of taxes I was setting aside each month. The note
originated in <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a>, and after I pasted it into Apple
Notes, it lost all its formatting.</p>

<p>There were no proper section headings, the formatting was
inconsistent between paragraphs, and the monetary amounts had been
entered with different c

<p>Ryan Christoffel, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/12/13/whats-new-in-ios-18-2">also</a> at 9to5Mac:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are two key features that will are <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/12/05/ios-18-2-release-notes/">part of iOS 18.2</a>,
but aren’t yet ready for the Mac yet:</p>

<li><a href="https://9to5mac.com/image-tools-in-ios-182-these-new-apple-intelligence-features-are-coming/">Genmoji</a></li>
<li><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/11/22/ios-182-upgrades-apple-mail-with-its-biggest-redesign-ever/">Mail app redesign</a></li>
</ol>

<p>Genmoji are an especially unfortunate omission, as they’re
available on both iPhone and iPad with iOS and iPadOS 18.2.
Meanwhile the Mail app redesign is currently iPhone-exclusive, so
it’s missing from both the Mac and iPad in these next software
updates.</p>

<p>The omission of Genmoji creation in MacOS 15.2, and the omission of the new AI inbox categorization features in Mail on both iPad and M

## What’s New in iOS 18.2

<p>Chance Miller has a good rundown for 9to5Mac:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The update includes major new Apple Intelligence features,
upgrades to the Camera Control on iPhone 16, a redesign for the
Mail app, and much more.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The new Apple Intelligence features lead the list, and certainly lead Apple’s marketing, but there’s quite a bit else new in 18.2 too.</p>

<p>New app, spearheaded by Ev Williams:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mozi is a private social network for seeing your people more, IRL.
Add your plans, check who’s in town, and know when you overlap.</p>

<p>iOS only at the moment, with “Sign in with Apple” as the only supported authentication method. One clever idea is that you can share travel plans and your location, and Mozi will coordinate when you might be in the same area as a friend. <a href="https://www.mozi.app/faqs">From their FAQ</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Why do you need access to my contacts? Will you ever contact
people in my phone book?</em></p>

<p>Never. We ask for access to your contacts so that you can connect
with the people you already know on Mozi. In order to see someone
on Mozi, you have to both be on Mozi and both have one another
saved as iOS contacts. We never send, sell or share any of your
information, and we will never contact your people on your behalf.
And instead of storing any actual ph
