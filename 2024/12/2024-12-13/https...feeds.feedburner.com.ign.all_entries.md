The women don’t know each other, and through a tech glitch suffered on account of the publisher trying to steal their ideas, their stories end up literally overlapping each other. That means Zoe gets thrown into Mio’s dark and gritty sci-fi world, and the pair are involuntarily thrown back and forth between that place and Zoe’s spells-and-sorcery woodland fantasy realm.

But even with the infusion of speed and action, it’s still very much a stealth game.
