An atmospheric probe model attached upside down to a quad rotor remotely piloted aircraft ascends with the Moon visible on Oct. 22, 2024. The quad rotor aircraft released the probe above Rogers Dry Lake, a flight area adjacent NASAâ€™s Armstrong Flight Research Center in Edwards, California. The probe was designed and built at the center.
