  <p id="LYOyRo">OpenAI is rolling out a feature called “Projects” to ChatGPT. It’s basically a folder system that makes it easier to organize things you’re working on while using the AI chatbot. </p>
<p id="9NiuYJ">As shown <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/FcB97h3vrzk?si=cGjzZ_h-mwQ-el5V">in a demo video</a>, your list of Projects will show up in the sidebar. If you make a new project, you can do things like edit the title, set a color for the project’s icon, and add files as well as instructions to tailor how ChatGPT responds to things in that individual project. You can also add previous chats to your project to keep track of them.</p>
