<p>Your PC storage drives won’t last forever — which is why a backup strategy is so crucial for keeping your data safe. The best Windows backup software is your cover if/when your primary drive fails.</p>



<p>While Apple’s Time Machine provides users with an effective, set-it-and-forget-it recovery system, Microsoft users aren’t so lucky. Instead, users are stuck deciding the best way to keep their data safe with a patchwork system of restore points, recovery discs, and file backups. Thankfully, there are a number of great third-party backup options for Windows. </p>



<p><strong>Why you should trust us:</strong> It’s in our name: PCWorld. Our reviewers have been testing PC hardware, software, and services for decades. Our backup evaluations are thorough and rigorous, testing the promises and limitations of every product — from performance to the practical

<p>Endless rumors have pointed to CES 2025 in January as the big reveal for Nvidia’s hotly anticipated GeForce RTX 50-series graphics cards, powered by the company’s new “Blackwell” architecture. With a media blitz timed to coincide with this year’s (surprisingly good!) Game Awards, Nvidia effectively made it unofficially official.</p>



<p>First, the part I’m personally most hyped about: CDProjekt’s surprise <em>Witcher 4</em> cinematic reveal. I’ve dropped the trailer below (handle your biz, Ciri!), but the important part for this article is the note right at the beginning: “Cinematic trailer pre-rendered in Unreal Engine 5 on an unannounced Nvidia GeForce RTX GPU.” Giggity!</p>

<p>Thermal paste (otherwise known as thermal grease) is mentioned a lot more than you might think in gamer forums and by PC builders, which is surprising considering it’s just a small addition to any rig.</p>



<p>But the fact is thermal paste does keep CPU and GPU temperatures down and aids performance when it’s applied properly, so getting it right is certainly worth doing.</p>



<p>Here we look at how thermal pastes can differ, what to look out for, and how best to apply them.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="why-thermal-paste-matters">Why thermal paste matters</h3>



<p>If you’re going to be building a gaming PC or overclocking it, you’re going to want thermal paste on your CPU and / or your GPU. These pastes, which are made up of different compounds, are designed to fill in the space between the processors and their heatsinks and siphon heat aw

<p>Pour one out. <a href="https://windowsreport.com/mozilla-firefox-removes-do-not-track-feature-support-heres-what-it-means-for-your-privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Windows Report reports</a> that Mozilla has removed the tracking blocker in its Firefox browser.

<p>Mozilla writes on its support page that the setting has been removed, as it simply does not work well enough anymore. “Many sites do not respect this indication of a person’s privacy preferences, and, in some cases, it can reduce privacy,” Mozilla says. This is why we can’t have nice things. </p>

<p>With so many data breaches lately, receiving yet another email about yet another breach no longer feels unusual. But before you click on any links, take a closer look at the message — it might be a phishing attempt.</p>



<p>Yep, the message you received could be a fake, designed to trick you into sharing sensitive info like your login credentials or personal details. These kinds of grabs at your data aren’t unusual, and the approaches can vary. Some may directly impersonate companies while others may pose as security software (e.g., Norton, Malwarebytes, etc.), which periodically send legitimate emails to subscribers about the latest online attacks.</p>



<p>Fortunately, you can avoid these attacks by sidestepping the messages. Don’t click on any links — instead, open a new browser tab and search for the name of the company plus “data breach” or “hacked

<p>Virtual private networks, or VPNs, are one of the most effective ways to keep your data private and secure while online. They encrypt and hide our confidential web activity and are a key component in helping us to navigate safely while connected to the internet.</p>



<p>As VPN usage continues to increase globally these apps are quickly becoming a cornerstone of our online security. Due to this importance, it’s worth looking at what’s in store for the next-gen VPNs to see how they’ll continue to provide us privacy and security into the future.</p>



<p>From VPNs utilizing blockchain to new encryption standards even quantum computers can’t break—and maybe even anonymity for your smart appliances—here are the coming advancements in VPN tech I’m most excited for.</p>
