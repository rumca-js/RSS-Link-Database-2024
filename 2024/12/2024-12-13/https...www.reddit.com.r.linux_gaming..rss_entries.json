With most nvidia drivers, I have the issue where my DVI monitor gets no input despite being recognised (known issue but 565.77 does not work). I was keeping the drivers pinned to dkms 535 with yay for this reason.</p> <p>Well, I ran `pacman -Syu` (i use arch btw) and it ran into issues with version 535. Fine, I&#39;ll get the latest that Nvidia recommends for my card. That being 550.135. Installed with yay, again.</p> <p>Except, I wasn&#39;t going yay when the update was done. I used the Nvidia x-server settings to tweak the colours on my main display as they are quite washed out (not the monitor&#39;s fault, my xbox has great colour on it).</p> <p>Is there any way of getting those settings back without breaking my fragile driver installation?</p> <p>Edit, with more information:</p> <ul> <li>In steam, the top menu item",

I recently imaged a new PC and mistakenly installed the Flatpak steam rather than the Debian steam, I only noticed when I went to install ALVR and it wouldn&#39;t link to steamVR. Before this I was playing a bunch of Marvel Rivals with my friends with no issues. When I switched over to the Debian version of steam, I noticed the video intro and video background on the home screen of Marvel Rivals was just black, come to find out I needed the GE version of proton for media codecs. My question is, why didn&#39;t I need the GE version in the Flatpak version of steam? Are media codecs included with the Flatpak version?
