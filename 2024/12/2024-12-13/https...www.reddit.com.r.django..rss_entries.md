Do you agree with me here? It seems that the framework is not written to follow SOLID. Does it follow some kind of other philosophy? It&#39;s hard for me to understand what&#39;s best practice when even the giant in the industry (e.g. Django) doesn&#39;t follow it...</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/aldosebastian"> /u/aldosebastian </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/1hdidm0/django_and_solid_principles/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/1hdidm0/django_and_solid_principles/">[comm
