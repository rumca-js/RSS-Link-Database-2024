<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I may be committing a Cardinal sin here.... But I&#39;m not a developer. BUT I want to hear genuine opinions from the community so hopefully you&#39;ll lend me your ears. </p> <p>I have an idea for an app. I know in my soul that it will be successful. I can&#39;t stop thinking about it. Id love to give a developer the money they deserve to use their talents and hard earned experience to develop it. However I don&#39;t have that money. What I want to do is offer someone payment in terms of business partnership that includes a % amount of the profits once the app is making money. </p> <p>My question is, would anyone find that offer offensive? I appreciate that putting work into something with no payment upfront and no actual guarantee it will take off is a risk but I want to make sure I don&#39;t look like an A-hole you know? </p> <p>If the general consensus is that an offer like this is ok and it&#39;s a yes or no type deal - where is the best plac

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi there.</p> <p>I am a web developper, using typescript, with reactjs and nest for a living. I would like to learn another language that is all purpose. I have made some c# softwares for myself, and i have been learning python also.</p> <p>At the moment i am learning pygame and my goal is to create indie games without any game engine (only frameworks). I will stop using python because of the performance problem, and if in years i would like to make a much bigger game, that could be a problem (or not, it might be faster in years)</p> <p>There is bevy for rust and monogame for c#.</p> <p>I would like to know, which language would you guys choose to learn, to create games, web applications and desktop applications (such as game launchers, updater and tools to make it faster/easier to maintain or add stuff.)</p> <p>I am using linux and soon macos for developping, and windows only to play. I would like also to get rid of all the Microsoft ecosystem.</p>
