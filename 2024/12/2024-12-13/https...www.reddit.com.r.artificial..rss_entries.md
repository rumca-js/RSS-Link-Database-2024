<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’m not a programmer but I am just thinking we should reframe how we look at AI.</p> <p>It is a new type of intelligence, it’s like a tool.</p> <p>But it’s to a tool to emulate us.</p> <p>That is how a child functions, through imitation.</p> <p>Right now AI is in its infancy so of course many are going to be like “It’s not that smart, it can’t do my job yet”….yet. </p> <p>Literally everything we can do on computers can be imitated. Even our voices. </p> <p>Humanity has created its own unified child. And we are teaching…rapidly. Before we know it it’ll be an adult. </p> <p>I think many people still are not even aware of the potential AI will be able to do. </p> <p>The film industry is going to be hit the hardest first because of the ease of generation. </p> <p>Now a lot of these changes will probably be really good. Just as with every new generation there are discoveries and fresh perspectives…it changes the current lifestyle and status quo.</p> <p>AI
