        "description": "<p>Conan the Barbarian: Battle of the Black Stone #3 begins with the Heroes of Man reeling from the loss of two of their own. The giant, many-armed creature now known as the Beast of the Black Stone has demonstrated that it\u2019s capable of pursuing and killing its victims across time and space, and that there is no safe refuge for Conan and the other gathered champions. The Pictish scout Brissa guides them through the wilderness using a fragment of the Black Stone that harbors a remnant of the immolated Texan author James Allison\u2019s soul. Thrown together by circumstance, the six survivors react differently to their task and their companions. Conan and Brissa relish their unexpected reunion. Dour Puritan adventurer Solomon Kane and hot-tempered swordswoman Dark Agnes de Chastillon\u2014both displaced from the 16th century\u2014are skeptical of their companions but face the struggle against the Beast with grim resolve. Conrad and Kirowan remain fascinated by the occult implications of their plight. ",
