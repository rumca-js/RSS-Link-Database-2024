## Show HN: @smoores/epub, a JavaScript library for working with EPUB publications

<p>Howdy! I've just written a blog post about this, and I figured I would share it here: <a href="https://smoores.dev/post/announcing_smoores_epub/" rel="nofollow">https://smoores.dev/post/announcing_smoores_epub/</a>. As I've been working on Storyteller[1], I've been developing a library for working with EPUB files, since that's a large amount of the work that Storyteller does. After a friend asked for advice on creating EPUB books in Node.js, I decided to publish Storyteller's EPUB library as a standalone NPM package. I really love the EPUB spec, and I think the Node.js developer community deserves an actively maintained library for working with it!<p>[1]: <a href="https://smoores.gitlab.io/storyteller" rel="nofollow">https://smoores.gitlab.io/storyteller</a></p>

<p>Hey HN!<p>A few weeks ago, meet.hn was released.
We are now about 1700 hackers willing to meet each other in almost 700 locations worldwide.<p>Since then, some community requested features and bug fixes have been implemented.<p>- locations are now searchable and not restricted to a simplistic city-country pair<p>- locations work with diacritics and diverse languages<p>- new socials: personal website, email, Mastodon, Discord, GitLab, Google Scholar, YouTube, etc.<p>- upon user request, I can now showcase your local meetups on your location listing, as it's done for Old Toronto: [1]<p>About actual meetings, I'm aware of around a dozen so far, but I think many more occurred.<p>Why am I writing this post?<p>About 80% of the ~1700 signups happened in the first 36 hours after launch.
As expected, signups dropped pretty quickly, and now it gains about one new user every other day.<p>I think a ton of global value (and local joy) can emerge from HN users meeting each other.
That's why I'm

## Show HN: I made the slowest, most expensive GPT
 - [https://ithy.com](https://ithy.com)
 - RSS feed: $source
 - date published: 2024-12-13T15:05:07+00:00

<p>This is another one of my automate-my-life projects - I'm constantly asking the same question to different AIs since there's always the hope of getting a better answer somewhere else. Maybe ChatGPT's answer is too short, so I ask Perplexity. But I realize that's hallucinated, so I try Gemini. That answer sounds right, but I cross-reference with Claude just to make sure.<p>This doesn't really apply to math/coding (where o1 or Gemini can probably one-shot an excellent response), but more to online search, where information is more fluid and there's no "right" search engine + text restructuring + model combination every time. Even o1 doesn't have online search, so it's obviously a hard problem to solve.<p>An example is something like "best ski resorts in the US", which will get a different response from every GPT, but most of their rankings won't reflect actual skiers' consensus - say, on Reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/skiing/comments/sew297/updated_us_ski_areas_tier_list_v

<p>It was a lot of work as a solo project but I hope you guys think it’s cool. When I say “we” in the website it’s only in the most royal sense possible. I also did all the photo/videography. I started out designing a single machine for personal use, but like many things it sort of spiraled out of control from there.<p>I felt like espresso machines were getting very large, plasticky, and app-integrated without actually improving the underlying technologies that make them work. The noisy vibratory pumps in particular are from 1977 and haven’t really changed since then. So I wanted to focus on making the most advanced internals I could and leaving everything else as minimalist as possible. The pump is, as far as I know, completely unique in terms of power density and price. Without spending several thousand dollars, it was difficult to find a machine with a gear pump, and adjustable pressure was also similarly expensive but this machine has those things and costs a normal amount to buy
