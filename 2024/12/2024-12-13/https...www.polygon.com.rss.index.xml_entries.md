<p class="has-text-align-none">During Thursday night’s Game Awards ceremony, founder and host Geoff Keighley surprised everyone by looking  like he was going to burst into tears as he revealed that Capcom is working on a sequel to its PlayStation 2 classic <em>Okami</em> with original director Hideki Kamiya.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s one of the most human and relatable things I’ve ever seen Keighley do, and I was right there with him. As I watched the simple teaser — which consists of little more than stirring music, footage of a wolf running, the Capcom logo, and Kamiya’s name — I too did a little cry.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is the crux of understanding what’s new, interesting, and ultimately unwieldy about <em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</em>, the first entry in the decades-old series to actively court casual flyers and Xbox Game Pass-ersby. The series’ modern handlers at Asobo Studio aim for two extremes in this iteration: a realistic flight sim that lets aviation pros flip every switch on the overhead panel of an Airbus A310 airliner, and a gamepad-friendly, assists-filled game that teaches basic skills and allows the player to set a course to pretty-lo
