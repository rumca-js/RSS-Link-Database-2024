I&#39;m wondering if there are any issues and solutions available about playing while sitted on the wheelchair, such as turning and moving? I&#39;m looking specifically at the PSVR2 and Quest 3. Does the hand tracking means I do not need to hold the controllers and can just use my hands for playing?
