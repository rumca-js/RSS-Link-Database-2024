I can&#39;t stop thinking about it. Id love to give a developer the money they deserve to use their talents and hard earned experience to develop it. However I don&#39;t have that money. What I want to do is offer someone payment in terms of business partnership that includes a % amount of the profits once the app is making money. </p> <p>My question is, would anyone find that offer offensive? I appreciate that putting work into something with no payment upfront and no actual guarantee it will take off is a risk but I want to make sure I don&#39;t look like an A-hole you know? </p> <p>If the general consensus is that an offer like this is ok and it&#39;s a yes or no type deal - where is the best plac",
