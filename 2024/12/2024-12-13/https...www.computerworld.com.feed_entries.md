<p>Although the amount “hidden” was only $151 million — at the high end of Macy’s original estimate of “$132 million to $154 million” — the retailer said it exposed a massive weakness in its checks and balances procedures.</p>

<p>Apple has already seized a leadership position with Apple Silicon. Now, it seeks to build a second bridgehead in networking chips so it can <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3619921/apples-iphone-se-4-will-matter-very-much-indeed.html">make the 5G chip</a>, the Wi-Fi chip, and Bluetooth chips used inside its devices.</p>



<p>Why? </p>



<p>Cutting component costs might be part of its calculation, but improving performance, battery life, and the integration of these very different networking components might well yield a greater prize.</p>



<p>Apple now aims to introduce the first combined Wi-FI/Bluetooth chip in Apple TV and HomePod mini in early 2025, with the component set t

<p>Google <a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/notebooklm-google-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unveiled NotebookLM last year</a>, initially under the name Project Tailwind, and began testing the AI-powered “notebook” with select users.

Users can then query via a generative AI (genAI) chatbot interface. </p>

<p>For all the ways travel’s evolved over the years, one thing has remained maddeningly steadfast: Moving from one place to another is almost always a hassle. There’s endless room for inconvenience and error, and a journey rarely goes according to plan.</p>

<p>A new class action lawsuit alleges poor working conditions and “exploitive” behavior by AI data processing company Scale AI, saying that workers responsible for generating much of its product were mischaracterized by the company as independent contractors, rather than full employees.</p>



<p>Scale AI’s core business centers on using human input to label and shape AI responses to queries, helping to make responses more accurate and usable. For instance, a worker might label images from a car’s LIDAR detector to help create an AI that more accurately identifies objects.</p>
