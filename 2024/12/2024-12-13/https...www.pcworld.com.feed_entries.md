If you’re still using those apps, you’ll start receiving pop-ups notifying you that end-of-support is coming up on December 31, 2024, and you’ll be urged to switch over to the new Outlook app that Microsoft is focusing on.</p>



<p>More recently, Microsoft has started pushing users in that direction even harder.
