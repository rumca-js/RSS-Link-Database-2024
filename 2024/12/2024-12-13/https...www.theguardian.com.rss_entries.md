This month, the company unveiled a “<a href="https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/openai-confirms-200-monthly-subscription-180000283.html">pro mode</a>” for its new “o1” AI system, offering human-level reasoning — for 10 times the current $20 monthly subscription fee.

In testing, when the system was led to believe it would be shut down, it attempted to disable an oversight mechanism.

<p>(Scarlet Tiger)<br>Producer Felix Weatherall adopts another guise, swapping lo-fi analogue for a disorienting burst of alternative dance music</p><p>Felix Weatherall, the London producer best known as <a href="https://www.rossfromfriends.net/">Ross From Friends</a>, has spent much of his career escaping other people’s preconceptions. He <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tKKNV5sXUs">emerged</a> in the mid-2010s as the most popular face of the so-called “lo-fi house” or “YouTube house” scene – not really a scene, as much as a collection of producers making analog-sounding dance music that algorithms loved – and since then has worked hard to show he has more to offer than just supremely curated vibes. His latest project, under the alias Bubble Love, is a sharp pivot away from sepia-toned gauziness: it’s a high-energy pop-club record that’s extremely fun, if far from groundbreaking.</p><p><em><a href="https://bubblelove.lnk.to/BubbleLovePR">Bubble Love</a></em><a href="https:/

<p>The former England captain on CTE, legal action and 2003 World Cup winners reunion for ‘Unbreakable’ documentary </p><p>Phil Vickery sighs. His cheeks are red, his eyes are wet. “I’m quite emotional, always have been,” he says. “I don’t know why. Maybe it’s my upbringing, middle child, the-forgotten-about-one, I don’t know. No one ever gave me anything. I used to argue with the sports psychologist, they always told you: ‘Emotion clouds judgment’. Well it might well do, sunshine, but let me tell you, when you’re binding up for a scrum and you’re a-metre-and-a-half apart and you’ve got something over there, a tonnage, who wants to fucking eat you, you need to be emotional. If you ain’t, there’s something wrong with you.”</p><p>Retirement has been hard on Vickery. He used that emotional energy as fuel when he was a player.

<p>There are between 100,000 and 300,000 of these snakes in the region – and they can swallow a small deer whole. What can Florida do about this threat to biodiversity?</p><p>An invasive predator that can grow up to 20ft, weigh over 100kg and devour prey six times its size – it is enough to make anyone’s skin crawl. That’s what residents of southern Florida have been struggling with for the past few decades, with the rapid growth of the Burmese python population in the Everglades.</p><p>In a recent study in <a href="https://journals.ku.edu/reptilesandamphibians/article/view/21867">Reptiles and Amphibians</a>, a team of researchers considered the maximal gape of three Burmese pythons – in other words, they measured how wide the snakes could open their mouths. The smallest of the pythons had been found consuming a 35kg deer. So perhaps it isn’t surprising the researchers discovered that all three snakes had impressive maximal gapes of 26cm (10 inches), 1.5in wider than previous studies

<p>A Manchester derby at a bad time for both teams, managers with shared values and Forest’s European dream</p><p>Sean Dyche may be struggling to find reasons for optimism before his Everton side travel to Arsenal. The Toffees used to be tricky opponents for Mikel Arteta, earning wins under Carlo Ancelotti and Rafael Benítez. Dyche enjoyed a 1-0 win at Goodison in his first meeting with Arsenal as Everton manager, but has lost their three encounters since. Everton’s only win on the road this season came at Ipswich in October – also the last time they scored away from home – while Arteta’s side are on a 14-game unbeaten run at the Emirates. Dyche can be forgiven for having one eye on the January transfer window, saying on Thursday that the Friedkin Group’s proposed takeover “is looking very possible … but, until it’s done, it’s not done.” Whatever the result on Saturday, we can expect set-piece goals. Arsenal have scored a league-high 23 goals from corners since the start of last seas

<p>The new gatekeepers use ‘trust’ to discredit the press and talk about removing bias with AI - distracting us from their own shift to the right</p><p>If we want to know what news organisations will look like under the second Trump administration in America, well, we are beginning to get an idea. At the Dealbook conference in New York last week, Jeff Bezos, the owner of the Washington Post and multi-billionaire founder of Amazon, gave a very <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/04/business/dealbook/jeff-bezos-trump-amazon-washington-post.html">favourable assessment</a> of Donald Trump’s upcoming second term. “I am very hopeful … he seems to have a lot of energy around reducing regulation,” beamed Bezos.

Instead the writers crafted an endorsement of Democratic candidate Kamala Harris which Bezos killed, in his first act of blatant editorial interference since he bought the title

<p>The hosts were unbeatable at the Gabba until India broke the spell but a series of changes mean they can start to rebuild the record in the third Test</p><p>It’s passing strange. In town ahead of the Australia-India Test, Brisbane feels as it always has: guys walking down Queen Street carrying boxes of mangoes, the Queensland humidity performing its ritual of luxuriant suffocation as the city’s air begrudgingly shifts along the snake-path of the river.

Pointed out with a heavy drumbeat of symbolism, the previous visiting winner was the great West Indies team of 1988. It took the best ever to achieve this feat, was the message.
