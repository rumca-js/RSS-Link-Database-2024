        "description": "Dexter's run on television is often seen as having many up's and downs during it's airing on Showtime.  With 8 seasons in the original series, a continuation with Dexter New Blood and an upcoming prequel series Dexter Original Sin, there have been many adversaries Dexter has gone up against.  But no other villain in the series quite stacked up like the Trinity Killer.   The Trinity Killer was Dexters most complex villain.  Not only because of his characters background and motivation, but because the Trinity Killer was basically a mirror being held up to Dexter.  But what exactly made him Dexter's greatest villain? \n\n#dexter #dexternewblood #johnlithgow #michaelchall #nerdstalgic",
