I live in Italy and prices for importing them from the US o UK are too high for me and here they are almost impossible to find and if you do they have prices over 2-300 euros. Is there some kind of way for me to print them on my own? I really have no clue as to how I might do it so I&#39;m posting this to see if someone can give me some advice.

While on vacation with one of the couples I picked up dice forge and we really enjoyed playing it. The problem is it is only 4 players, so our normal group of six can\u2019t play it. For anyone that has played the game do you think we could buy an extra version of the game add say two extra cards to each stack, add two extra tiles to each section, and adjust the rolling where maybe the 6th player doesn\u2019t roll or something to that extent. I\u2019m wondering if anyone can think of ways to make it work. Our group doesn\u2019t split and play separate either so please don\u2019t make that suggestion.

I used to really like playing games like that too as a kid (there\u2019s one in particular but the name is escaping me).
