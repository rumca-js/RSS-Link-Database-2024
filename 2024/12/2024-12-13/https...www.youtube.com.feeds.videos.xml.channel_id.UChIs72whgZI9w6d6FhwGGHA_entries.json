The B580 'Limited Edition' card from Intel is on the modmat today, getting torn down for inspection into its assembly quality after the nightmarish assembly of the original Arc A770 and A750 GPUs. Intel has improved in huge ways with this much simpler, more \"boring\" (in a good way) video card design.\n\nWatch our original tear-down of the A770 -- or just read the comments, because they're hilarious: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N371iMe_nfA\nHere's our Intel B580 review with all the gaming, power, frametime, and efficiency benchmarks! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjdCkSsLYLk\n\nWhile it's still active, use code 'PUCKGAMERSNEXUS' on the store for 10% off!
