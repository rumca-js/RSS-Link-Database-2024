However, I\u2019ve been wondering about the implications of streaming. If I were to stream myself playing a ROM without mentioning that I\u2019m using an emulator on Steam, would anyone be able to tell? Should I avoid streaming a pirated ROM, or can I take the risk without facing penalties? The games I&#39;m mainly referring to are from NES, GBA, and Sega consoles.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Mr_smil3y69\"> /u/Mr_smil3y69 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/emulation/comments/1hd9jaq/question_about_streaming_roms_and_copyright_laws/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/emulation/comments/1hd9jaq/question_about_streaming_roms_and_copyright_laws/\">[comments]</a></span>",
