In order, we have 2017's Resident Evil 7, the remakes for RE 2 and 3, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-village">Resident Evil Village</a>, and most recently <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-4-remake">Resident Evil 4 Remake</a>. Capcom's in-house RE Engine forms the technical backbone for all five games, of course, and each one runs as a native PS5 app. Except, there's often been a catch to their performance delivery on base PS5 - whether it's using RT features at 60fps in some cases, or enabling a 120Hz HFR mode in others, there's potential not b

So, too, is Mythwrecked's promise of a wholesome, frictionless adventure - as we haul ourselves towards 2024's finishing line, I can't imagine anything more delightful than losing a few hours exploring a lush, tropical island.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mythwrecked-ambrosia-island-review">Read more</a></p>

First, there was the arrival of a major update for Lego Fortnite Odyssey (the mode previously also simply known as 'Lego Fortnite') that adds the Storm King boss as a big endgame challenge, akin to the Ender Dragon in Minecraft.

## The Cabin Factory review - a gimmick worth the cheap price of entry

<img src="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/The-Cabin-Factory-header.jpg?width=1920&height=1920&fit=bounds&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp" /> <p>I like a good gimmick. I think the term unfortunately has negative connotations, used by people to downplay something neat as the only thing going for a product - a game, film, bit of tech, etc. The Cabin Factory is essentially one gimmick. It's not really a full game built around a gimmick, it's just the gimmick. It's a really cool one, though. Is a cabin haunted? Yes or no. Simple. I couldn't play with headphones on, needed to make the room bright, and had Bluey playing on my phone next to my monitor to lower my stress level. It's a damn scary gimmick!</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-cabin-factory-review">Read more</a></p>
