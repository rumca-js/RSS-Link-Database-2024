These stay the same in every document.</p> <p>The content changes depending on the customer, with variables like the customer\u2019s name, the amount of money, and a short recommendation.</p> <p>From a purely text point of view, writing the content itself is straightforward since it\u2019s not overly complicated and ChatGPT can already write what I need almost prefectly.

Is it because the output isn&#39;t language that humans find relatable, and therefore they aren&#39;t compelled to anthropomorphize it, or because marketing has effectively obscured how radically different the things we call AI are?</p> <p>In a way, it reminds me of the shitstorm of hype surrounding blockchain and cryptocurrency. Both technologies have sparked immense interest and investment, driven by their potential to revolutionize various industries. However, this fervor often emphasizes flashy, high-profile applications, and when people started getting disillusioned with them they sort of threw the baby out with the bathwater.

Wouldn&#39;t it be a flawed and dangerous tool ? The fundamental concern here is that AGI, like any AI, learns from the data it is trained on. If that data is biased, manipulative, or outright false, the AGI could inherit those flaws, potentially amplifying them in ways that are difficult to control. If an AGI is exposed to disinformation - whether in the form of political propaganda, fake news, or manipulated narratives - it may learn to perpetuate or even amplify these falsehoods. This could lead to the spread of harmful ideologies or decisions based on inaccurate information, both in political contexts and beyond. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/FluidMeasurement8494\"> /u/FluidMeasurement8494 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Ar",

I\u2019m working on a project that involves generating a series of AI-generated frames using Stable Diffusion to create smooth and consistent animations. My workflow requires:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Consistent art style</strong> across frames (using LoRA fine-tuning).</li> <li><strong>Consistent key elements</strong> like characters or objects (using DreamBooth).</li> <li><strong>Smooth transitions</strong> between frames (using techniques like Flux).</li> </ul> <p>Currently, I\u2019m experiencing a major bottleneck\u2014each frame takes ~3 minutes to render on my setup, and creating enough frames for even a short animation is incredibly time-consuming. At this rate, generating a one-minute video could take over 24 hours!</p> <p>I\u2019m already exploring AWS g4 instances (Tesla T4 GPUs) to speed up rendering, but I\u2019d like to know if anyone has tips or experience with:</p> <ol> <li>Optimized Stable Diffusion models or alternative lightweight architectures.</l",

I saw HIX AI, which claims to help make AI writing clearer as well as make it detection proof.</p> <p>Has anyone tried making instructional content with it? Did it really improve readability and clarity? What were the detection rates on certain services? Thanks in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/glutenbag\"> /u/glutenbag </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1hd5ffy/can_hix_ai_improve_technical_writing/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1hd5ffy/can_hix_ai_improve_technical_writing/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Smart grids, leveraging AI algorithms to analyze real-time data from numerous sources (weather patterns, energy consumption levels, grid stability indicators), dynamically adjust energy distribution to minimize waste and optimize resource allocation. This granular control leads to reduced operational costs for utilities, decreased reliance on peak power generation (often from less efficient sources), and ultimately a smaller carbon footprint.</p> <p><a href=\"https://sustainability-directory.com/question/what-are-the-long-term-implications-of-ai-powered-energy-management-for-the-energy-sector-and-society/\">https://sustainability-directory.com/question/what-are-the-long-term-implications-of-ai-powered-energy-management-for-the-energy-sector-and-society/</a></p> <p>Source: <a href=\"https://remoteupskill.com\">https://remoteupskill.com</a></p> ",
