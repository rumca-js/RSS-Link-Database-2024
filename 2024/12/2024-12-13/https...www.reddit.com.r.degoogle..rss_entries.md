<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I did find a thread from a year ago, but wanted to see if anybody has any recent recommendations on an alternative to Google keep which has worked well but IOS 18 broke it and it&#39;s stuck at Updating. One thing I would need is a decent web interface as well as I like to keep the different lists like Costco, BJ&#39;s, work, upcoming birthdays, etc all open in a tab in Safari.

I got flashbacks of the time they forced me out of chrome. </p> <p>For a while I&#39;ve been unable to login to my mail account.
