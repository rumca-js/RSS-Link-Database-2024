There's so many wargames out there - are we spoiled for choice, or fracturing wargaming? Commenters have let me know.

I'm now a partner on Twitch! I paint minis every Friday morning and Monday night, and sometimes take paint breaks (play video games poorly). Follow me: http://www.twitch.tv/tabletopminions
