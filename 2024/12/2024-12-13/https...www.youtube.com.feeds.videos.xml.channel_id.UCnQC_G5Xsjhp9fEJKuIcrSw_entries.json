Ben also discusses the DOJ\u2019s report, which reveals the FBI\u2019s lack of canvassing and preparation before January 6th. \n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Click here to join the member-exclusive portion of my show: https://bit.ly/3WDjgHE\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Finish your Christmas shopping with one click.

        "description": "Dr. Kevin Roberts is the President of The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank that plays a central role in hosting national public policy debates among the political right. In his new book, \u201cDawn\u2019s Early Light,\u201d Roberts offers a diagnosis of America\u2019s most urgent problems, as well as a series of policy prescriptions for a more prosperous future. In this episode of The Sunday Special, Kevin discusses the tradeoffs inherent to policymaking, why Republicans must not neglect fiscal conservatism any longer, and which executive agency he would reform first. Roberts also injects nuance into our foreign policy debates and explains why some institutions are not even worth overhauling. Stay tuned, and welcome back to another episode of The Sunday Special.\n\n- - -\u00a0\n\nToday\u2019s Sponsors:\n\nCollars & Co - Get 20% off your first order when you use code BEN at: https://collarsandco.com\n\nTax Network USA - Seize control of your financial future!

Ben discusses Bill Clinton\u2019s latest interview, where he states that the Trump administration made up Hillary\u2019s classified email claims, yet goes on to say that maybe he should talk to Biden about a preemptive pardon for Hillary. Ben also talks about the recent good news for Republicans. The 5th Circuit stated that the SEC\u2019s policy for NASDAQ is a violation of the law, and their adversity mandate is a joke. Lastly, he talks about Justin Trudeau bashing Americans for not electing Hillary or Kamala. \n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Click here to join the member-exclusive portion of my show: https://bit.ly/3WDjgHE\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Finish your Christmas shopping with one click.
