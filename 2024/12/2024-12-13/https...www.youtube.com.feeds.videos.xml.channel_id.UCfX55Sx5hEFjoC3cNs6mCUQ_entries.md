The Linux Foundation's Open Source Maturity in Europe report aims to capture the region's unique, community-driven approach to open source, contrasting it with North America's more industry-focused initiatives. In this episode, Cailean Osborne, Researcher, and Mirko Boehm, Senior Director of Community Development at the Linux Foundation Europe, explore key insights from the report. They discuss Europeâ€™s strong support for open source principles, the challenges in bridging public and private sector adoption, and the role of open source in advancing AI and machine learning under emerging regulations like the EU AI Act. They also highlight cultural barriers and the need for leadership support and financial support to sustain open source growth.
