<blockquote>
  <p>Researchers at OpenAI believe that some rival AI developers are
training their reasoning models by using OpenAI’s o1 reasoning
models to generate training data, according to a person who has
spoken to the company’s researchers about it. In short, the rivals
can ask the o1 models to solve various problems and then use the
models’ <em>chain of thought</em> — the “thought process” the models use
to solve those problems — as training data, the person said.</p>

<p>You might be wondering how rival developers can do that. OpenAI
has explicitly said it hides its reasoning models’ raw chains of
thought due in part to competitive concerns.</p>

<p>But in answering questions, o1 models include a summarized version
of the chain of thought to help the customer understand how the
models arrived at the answer. Rivals can simply ask another LLM to
take that summarized chain of thought and predict what the

<p><strong>Stanford Review:</strong> That is an application question that we have to answer to apply here.</p>
