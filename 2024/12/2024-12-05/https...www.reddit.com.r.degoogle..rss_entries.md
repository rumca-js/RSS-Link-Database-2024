<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am wanting to start degoogling. I want to essentially start with email. However my entire life seems to be intertwined with my Gmail account. I read a little about tuta amd it seemed it may offer me the ability to import my email.</p> <p>I have read very little about proton, but they are based in Switzerland. I trust the Swiss over the Germans when it comes to protecting privacy. I am honestly probably overreacting g a little as I live a not interesting life to the usgov. But I value my privacy and don&#39;t want to risk that as I have been doing. </p> <p>After email what&#39;s the next logical step? I don&#39;t have cable.pr satellite amd use youtubetv. I&#39;m am avid üèà fan and want sunday ticket. Is it OK to not degoogle cable? Thanks for reading this far if you have. Also if you have other su s in here you want to just link for me to read that&#39;s fine. No need to rehash it all again my search just doesn&#39;t seem to always get me the answer
