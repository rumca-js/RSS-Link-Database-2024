  <i>This is an edited transcript of a talk I just gave at <a href="https://cbdstconference.com/">CBD
 S&amp;T</a>, a chem-bio defence conference.  I needed to submit the slides
 several months in advance, so I tried out a new-to-me approach where the
 slides are visual support only and I finalized the text of the talk later
 on.  This does mean there are places where it would be great to have
    additional slides to illustrate some concepts</i>

 <i>Additionally, this was the first time I gave a talk where I wrote out
 everything I wanted to say in advance.  I think this made for a much less
 engaging talk, and for future ones I'm planning to go back to speaking from
 bullets.</i>
