<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>The recent murder of the CEO of United Healthcare and the corresponding discourse on the internet harkens directly back to the words of Steinbeck.</p> <p>I am in no way promoting nor celebrating violence, as Steinbeck quite clearly discusses how meaningless and futile such action is against large organizations.</p> <p>It&#39;s just impressive how true the words Steinbeck wrote were and perhaps will forever be. Here are some quotes from chapter 5 that I&#39;m sure most on this sub are quite familiar with.</p> <p>.....</p> <p>We&#39;re sorry. It&#39;s not us. It&#39;s the monster. The bank isn&#39;t like a man.</p> <p>Yes, but the bank is made of men.</p> <p>No, you&#39;re wrong there -- quite wrong there. The bank is something else than men. It happens that every man in a bank hates what the bank does, and yet the bank does it. The bank is something more than men, I tell you. It&#39;s the monster. Men made it, but they can&#39;t control it.</p> <p>...

It just had the exact cadence and word choices that I&#39;ve seen from ChatGPT often. I was also really disappointed in the second half because I thought it was gonna be a great slow burn romance and went a very different direction. Overall there were definitely things I liked about it but I just can&#39;t shake the feeling that she used AI writing.</p> <p>Examples (all from the same page):</p> <p>‚ÄúWow, C, I love how your moral compass rarely wavers, even when I try to corrupt it.

I&#39;ve looked at posts/comments from other parents about what good books are for the age group so I thought I&#39;d look back at my Goodreads and give a review informed by a 5/6 year old&#39;s perspective.</p> <p><strong>The BFG</strong> by Roald Dahl - The kid loved this. I found it unpleasant for reading aloud just for how many made up words there are, but it&#39;s fun.</p> <p><strong>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</strong> by Roald Dahl - This was probably the biggest hit. We&#39;ve been chasing this high all year. As an adult, you know if you are reading a book called &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; that Charlie Bucket is going to get one of those golden tickets. The joy and excitement on my kids face when he finally gets the ticket was a top 10 parenting moment. (Gene Wilder movie afterwards was also a hit.)</p
