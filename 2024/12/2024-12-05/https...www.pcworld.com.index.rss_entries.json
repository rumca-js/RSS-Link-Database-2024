Not only do they allow you to stay anonymous, but they can help safeguard your data and keep intrusive trackers at bay. Plus, they allow you to get around region blocks on streaming services and avoid ISP speed throttling. However, you usually have to pay for a VPN subscription and adding an extra monthly expense might not work. That\u2019s where a free VPN can come in handy, providing you with a similar level of security for no cost at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While I advise that you opt for a premium VPN, such as those in our roundup of <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/406870/best-vpn-services-apps-reviews-buying-advice.html\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/406870/best-vpn-services-apps-reviews-buying-advice.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer ",
