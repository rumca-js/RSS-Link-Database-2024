								<p><b>What are the best tabletop roleplaying games?</b> This guide picks the top tabletop RPGs in every genre, and explains the kind of gameplay they provide, what’s special about the system, and what you should be aware of before you play.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, we’ve included Dungeons and Dragons in this list. Its <a href="https://www.wargamer.com/dnd/classes">DnD classes</a> and <a href="https://www.wargamer.com/dnd/races">DnD races</a> are more iconic than any other TTRPG rules set. However, we don’t advocate for <i>only</i> playing D&amp;D. There are heaps of varied tabletop RPGs out there, with different strengths and settings, and they’re equally as worthy of your attention.</p>

Most magical RPGs have necromancers as a subclass of Wizards, but Paizo announced on December 4 that it would split necromancy off into its own dedicated class, with playtesting starting on December 9. Considering how disappointing necromancy is in <b>Dungeons and Dragons</b>, Pathfinder’s big sibling, this is something to get very excited about.</p>
