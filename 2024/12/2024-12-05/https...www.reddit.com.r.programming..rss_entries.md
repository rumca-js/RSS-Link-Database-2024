<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>There&#39;s this really old game called rollerball I had on a computer as a kid. I tried downloading it and it wouldn&#39;t run on my Windows 11 laptop. It just shows a white screen, flashing black very briefly a few times, while playing the menu music for a few seconds. Then the music just stops. The window also is labeled &quot;MainForm&quot; for some reason. I even tried running it on a Windows XP virtual machine (I used VirtualBox) and it did the same thing, except the music was much slower and very corrupt. The issue is exactly the same no matter where I download it from. This game came out in 2001 and 3D pinball space cadet, which came out in 1995, works just fine. </p> <p>If someone could figure out how to run this game that would be great!
