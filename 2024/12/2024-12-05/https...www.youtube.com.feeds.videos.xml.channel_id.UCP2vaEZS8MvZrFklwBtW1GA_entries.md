Schluter shower drain installation tips…I set the drain after the pan and ensure it’s centered. One big mistake folks make is leaving excess mortar under the KERDI waterproofing. It has to sit flat against the drain and the shower pan fleece. That allows the mortar to anchor into the fleece, crystallize, and form a matrix too intertwined for water to pass through 👍🏽🔥#showerremodel #showerdrain #schlutersystems #bathroomremodeling
