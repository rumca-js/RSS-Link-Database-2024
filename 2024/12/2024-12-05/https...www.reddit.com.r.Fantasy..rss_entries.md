It really highlights a big part of the subgenre today: self publishing. As a member of other book subs, many Romance focused, a large part of the culture is a desire to discover new authors and an adventurous spirit. Nearly half of the reading I did this year was of authors who are self or indie published. </p> <p>I know this sub doesn‚Äôt generally like Romantasy much but I did want to share: </p> <p><a href="https://www.uncannymagazine.com/article/romantasy-all-along/">https://www.uncanny

## Sanderson Deus Ex Machina

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Mistborn Spoilers*</p> <p>I often see one of the biggest reasons people love Sanderson (along with hard magic in general), is that his strict rules on writing involve a story NOT relying on deus ex machina.</p> <p>However, having read the first Mistborn book, I am very confused. It seemed to me like Final Empire ended with a deus ex machina. When Vin beats the bad guy, she takes in the mists. It didn‚Äôt seem to be hinted that was possible, and felt like an unexpected, last-minute boost to win the day. Is that not deus ex machina?</p> <p>And maybe later books discuss this, but does that erase the deus ex machina? The fact that there was information we didn‚Äôt know about at the time to justify it? If that‚Äôs the case, couldn‚Äôt you make that same argument for ALL deus ex machina? That it‚Äôs not cheating, you just don‚Äôt know all the details to justify it at the time?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Kooky

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So you&#39;ve started a series and you like it. You read through them , enjoying the world building, plot and characters but then you hit the one (or sometimes more than one) that doesn&#39;t fit&#39; with the rest. The characters are off doing out of character things, apparently the author forgot that the magic system doesn&#39;t work that way, the plot is weak, etc. Sometimes its right in the middle, and after that subsquent books return to form and you like them, but are always left wondering about that ONE book, was the author was forced to publish SOMETHING to keep the momentum going, or maybe trying something new that didn&#39;t work?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I don‚Äôt remember the last time I sat and read a physical novel, but I started a new job recently and there‚Äôs a lot of twiddling thumbs and the boss told me to get a good book so I picked up the Final Empire. </p> <p>I am fully committed to unraveling the Cosmere now. I really enjoyed the characters, the setting, the magic systems. It‚Äôs all awesome. And despite how bleak the world of Mistborn is, the characters provide so much (much needed) levity. It was just a very fun read and I‚Äôm excited to continue when Well of Ascension gets delivered to me tomorrow. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Sidopath"> /u/Sidopath </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1h6w40w/conversely_sanderson_has_me_completely_wrapped/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1h6w40w/conversely_sanderson_has_me_completely_wrapped/">[comments]</a></span>
