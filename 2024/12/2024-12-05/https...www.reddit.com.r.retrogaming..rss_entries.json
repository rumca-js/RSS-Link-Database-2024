I want to get a console for my son for Christmas, but I don&#39;t even really know what I&#39;m looking for. I&#39;ve had some experience using emulators on my laptop. Is there some kind of console out there that works like an emulator, something I can load games onto via a thumb drive maybe? I don&#39;t think I need any crazy graphics cards or anything, but I do want two player capability. My son likes Minecraft and I&#39;d like to show him some of the classic SNES games and maybe some N64.

If anyone knows of an Active community that this post would fit better with, I would be glad to repost this there to continue with the topic.</p> <p>Now, years have come and gone and with money being tight this year, I thought I might go back to an old game I&#39;ve played before for a change of pace. It&#39;s been years, so I&#39;ve just been wondering about good deck builds possible to make in the early game(first eleven floors) that can make winning future matches much easier.

Do you recall the first game you remember hearing as being &quot;rare&quot; and valuable in the earliest days of game collecting? Back in the pre-Reddit days on gaming forums I recall that Tengen Tetris for the NES was, for a time, considered one of the rarest games out there as everyone was familiar with the story of it being pulled from the market. As it turned out, once collecting became more popular Tengen Tetris really wasn&#39;t all that rare and I actually found a copy out in the wild a few years later. Stadium Events was certainly another but that&#39;s held up.</p> <p>Any other memories about games we thought were rare that didn&#39;t turn out to be or similar stories?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/cityside75\"> /u/cityside75 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1h7g8kb/what_was_the_first_",

He remembers that there was character that was a girl/woman that had either a white wolf or a white dog. It was supposedly not a side-scrolling fighting game, but something that worked sort of like Street Fighter. He played it in an arcade he used to go to.</p> <p>I&#39;ve googled for ages but cannot find out which game it is (not surprising considering the vague description), and I was thinking of giving him something related to the mystery game for x-mas.</p> <p>Anyone has an idea which game he may be thinking of?

I am a big fan of Retro Games Limited and interested to know what comes next.</p> <p>We are expecting an Amiga full size keyboard in Q1 2025, but what next? Here&#39;s a few ideas I would like:</p> <ol> <li>Full Size BBC Micro, so we can relive school days playing Tea Shop and Bomber on our lunch break / typing Guess The Number games. I would gladly settle for an Acorn Electron. It&#39;s only fair to Chris, seeing as Sir Clive has got his tribute.</li> <li>The CD32 Mini, to relive or play all the Amiga games we missed out on. With it&#39;s grey shell and paired with a matching controller, it would look amazing in my cabinet.</li> </ol> <p>Well, that&#39;s my ideas guys. I would love to know your opinions on my choices and what you would like to see.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/us",

I even tried plugging it directly into the board, but still no luck.<br/> My guess is that the HyloX update file skips the MVSX because it has a newer firmware version. Since it\u2019s already running version 2.0i, it might ignore the 2.0 HyloX firmware.<br/> Is there any way to install HyloX on my MVSX?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Artistic-Bear-8380\"> /u/Artistic-Bear-8380 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1h73q6a/mvsx_with_20i_firmware_not_recognizing_hylox/\">[link]</a></span> &#32",
