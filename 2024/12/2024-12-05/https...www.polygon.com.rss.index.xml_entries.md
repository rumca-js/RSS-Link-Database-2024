<p class="has-text-align-none">I love a good show about teenagers fighting supernatural entities while also facing the mortifying ordeal of being a high school student. So Netflix’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/animation-cartoons/464621/jentry-chau-vs-the-underworld-netflix-teaser-ali-wng"><em>Jentry Chau vs. the Underworld</em></a>, which not only sees a superpowered teenage girl battle demons but <em>also</em> draws from Chinese mythology, seems like it was created in a lab just for me. From the first trailer, I had high expectations. With bright, bold colors and character designs, compelling character relationships, and some very funky monsters and acti

<p class="has-text-align-none">Shortly after <a href="https://www.polygon.com/review/489950/infinity-nikki-windows-pc-review"><em>Infinity Nikki</em> launched late on Wednesday night</a>, hackers took down developer Infold Games’ official <em>Infinity Nikki</em> website to display a message encouraging suicide and pointing players toward <em>Genshin Impact</em> along with a QR code that seemingly led to a Discord server. The website for Infold Games’ science fiction romance simulation game <em>Love and Deepspace</em> was hacked with the same message, <a href="https://x.com/Legend0777/status/1864573047874736301">according to social media reports</a>.</p>
