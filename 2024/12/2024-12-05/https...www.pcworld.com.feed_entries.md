<p><a href="https://www.expressvpn.com/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.expressvpn.com/">ExpressVPN</a> continues its productive year with the roll-out of its new dedicated IP feature.

<p>The new feature will be an optional add-on service to ExpressVPN’s main subscription plan. It is currently available for Android, iOS, and Windows, with further platform availability expected in the near future.</p>



<p>Users will have the option to choose from dedicated IPs in 29 locations across 22 countries worldwide. The majority of which are located in Europe and North America. Pricing for the add-on service starts at $3.49 per month.</p>
