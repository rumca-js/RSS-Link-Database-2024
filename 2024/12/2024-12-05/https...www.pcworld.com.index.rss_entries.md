## Is Thunderbolt 5 storage ready? A first look at the cutting-edge tech

<p>Though it was a bit rough around the edges in terms of backwards compatibility, my first look at 80Gbps Thunderbolt 5 storage reveals a very nice uptick in performance — about twice the 40Gbps of Thunderbolt 3/USB 4 in certain benchmarks. Logical.</p>



<p>By way of comparison, that’s roughly as fast as an NVMe SSD on the PCIe 4.0 bus. And a PCIe 4.0 NVMe SSD is exactly what’s inside the OWC Envoy Ultra portable drive I used to test Thunderbolt 5 storage.</p>



<p><em>Note that you’ll see 120Gbps listed in the Thunderbolt 5 specs, but that’s uni-directional output for driving multiple high-resolution displays. Bi-directional transfers such as those used by storage devices are “limited” to 80Gbps, or roughly 6- to 7GBps after overhead.</em></p>

<p>Shopping for a smart thermostat that works with the new Matter standard? There aren’t many to choose from, but now you’ve got one more option. </p>



<p>Smart home manufacturer Meross has just unleashed its first thermostat to support Matter, the 2-year-old protocol that allows the big smart-home platforms to play nice with each other. </p>



<p>On sale now for $69.99 (a $30 price cut from its $99.99 list price), the <a href="https://shop.meross.com/collections/smart-thermostat/products/matter-smart-thermostat-mts300ma" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Meross Smart Wi-Fi Thermostat</a> is rated to work with 95 percent of HVAC systems, including single- and multi-stage furnaces, boilers, air conditioners, heat pumps, and fan coil units. </p>

<p>VPNs, or virtual private networks, are one of the most effective ways to stay safe online. Not only do they allow you to stay anonymous, but they can help safeguard your data and keep intrusive trackers at bay. Plus, they allow you to get around region blocks on streaming services and avoid ISP speed throttling. However, you usually have to pay for a VPN subscription and adding an extra monthly expense might not work. That’s where a free VPN can come in handy, providing you with a similar level of security for no cost at all.</p>



<p>While I advise that you opt for a premium VPN, such as those in our roundup of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/406870/best-vpn-services-apps-reviews-buying-advice.html" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.pcworld.com/article/406870/best-vpn-services-apps-reviews-buying-advice.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer

<p>According to a <a href="https://www.bristol.ac.uk/news/2024/december/diamond-battery-media-release.html">University of Bristol press release</a>, a team of scientists and engineers have made a significant breakthrough, successfully creating the world’s first carbon-14 diamond battery.</p>



<p>Based on the same radioactive isotope used in carbon dating, the new battery technology harnesses the radioactive decay of carbon-14, which emits a low level of energy for an extremely long time. It works like solar panels (which convert light into electricity) except instead of capturing photons (light particles), the diamond battery captures fast-moving electrons from the diamond’s structure.</p>

<p>Although I’ve been reviewing streaming devices for about a decade now, Samsung TVs have always been a blind spot.</p>



<p>I’ve never owned a Samsung TV until this past week, when I was bitten by the Black Friday OLED bug and installed one in my basement. And while I’d normally prefer an external streaming device over Samsung’s built-in smart TV software, the HDMI inputs have already been claimed by my <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1666826/tune-your-gaming-pc-for-the-living-room-10-tips-and-tweaks.html">home theater gaming PC</a>, an array of consoles, and a soundbar.</p>



<p>Thus I find myself learning to live with Samsung’s Tizen-based smart TV software and finding some ways to make the most of it. Here are the tips and tricks that I’ve found the most useful:</p>

<p>The perfect day-to-day laptop is one that has a good processor, plenty of RAM, and lots of storage space for all your files. Well, this HP Envy x360 2-in-1 laptop that checks all those boxes is <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/hp-envy-2-in-1-16-2k-touch-screen-laptop-amd-ryzen-7-16gb-memory-1tb-ssd-meteor-silver/6571083.p?skuId=6571083">on sale for just $650 at Best Buy</a> — a jaw-dropping $450 off its original $1,100 MSRP.</p>



<p>This 16-inch laptop features a 1920×1200 resolution touchscreen that’s great for work productivity and for light gaming. The display sits on a 360-degree hinge that you can fold back, turning it into a tablet-like form factor (which is what makes it a 2-in-1 laptop). It’s the perfect mode for reading documents, browsing the web, or even tenting the laptop so you have a propped-up screen for streaming TV shows and movies

<p>Microsoft is slowly launching Copilot Vision in preview, a version of Copilot that “reads over your shoulder” as you browse the web, to Copilot Pro subscribers today.</p>



<p>Microsoft is pitching Copilot Vision as a collaborative assistant that works along with you as you browse the Internet. Vision was part of a suite of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2472065/copilot-will-be-able-to-see-and-talk-to-you-microsoft-says.html">new Copilot demonstrations</a> that Microsoft showed off in October, and was easily the most underwhelming example of new Copilot technologies that I’d seen.</p>



<p>Copilot Vision isn’t a multimodal AI capability that can interpret the world around you. Instead, it’s a cross between <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2338891/windows-recall-could-solve-my-biggest-problem-in-tech.html">Windows Recall </a>and the cur

<p>There has been a lot of talk about AI chatbots over the past few years, but how much are they actually used? OpenAI’s CEO Sam Altman shared in a <a href="https://x.com/OpenAINewsroom/status/1864373399218475440">tweet</a> (spotted by <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/people-send-1-billion-messages-to-chatgpt-every-day/">MSPoweruser</a>) some figures that blew us away.</p>



<p>ChatGPT apparently has 300 million <em>weekly</em> active users, and the AI chatbot receives over 1 billion messages <em>every day</em>. Altman also boasts that over 1.3 million developers in the US alone have built upon OpenAI for various tools and services.

By accurately recording the time spent, workflows can be better planned and analyzed, which helps to optimize productivity. It’s important for companies to choose a tool that’s easy to use and integrate into existing systems, while freelancers should focus on flexibility and mobility.</p>



<p>The ability to generate reports and invoices also helps to communicate transparently with clients and avoid disputes over hours worked. Selection criteria include data protection and security, compatibility with various end devices, and flexible pricing based on individual needs.</p>

<p>At this time of year, an email about your annual benefits or bonus may not seem unusual. So you open the attached Word document, only for the app report that the file is corrupted but can be recovered. If you choose to recover the content, much less scan the QR code that appears, boom—you’ve fallen prey to a phishing attack. </p>



<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/novel-phishing-campaign-uses-corrupted-word-documents-to-evade-security/">BleepingComputer</a>, users tricked by this scheme are routed to a fake Microsoft login page that steals credential info if it’s entered.
