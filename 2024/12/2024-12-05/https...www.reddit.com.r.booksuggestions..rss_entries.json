I enjoy gothic literature and books with a darker feel, from classics (like Frankenstein, Dracula, We Have Always Lived In The Castle, Something Wicked This Way Comes etc) but also love more modern books like The Night Circus, thrillers like those by Gillian Flynn, Lisa Jewell... I&#39;m open to YA and fantasy as well (as long as there isn&#39;t a ton of world building to keep track of, I just started the Disc world series and my brain is at capacity \ud83d\ude02).

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi!! I\u2019ve been on a high fantasy kick for a while and it\u2019s bled into other outlets and interest. I\u2019m looking for a nonfiction guidebook on how to be a princess irl. Of course it sounds very far fetched but anything similar to that would be very appreciated, biographies, historical accounts, anything fascinating and would be a fun read for a fella who wants to be more like a princess in his everyday life. Hope you all have a wonderful day. And any recommendations you can come up with would be greatly appreciated.</p> <p>Sidenote: anything historical on lady knights as well would be very appreciated\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude0a\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Status-Secretary6854\"> /u/Status-Secretary6854 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1h78vh5/how_to_be_a_princess_handbook/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1h78vh5/how_to",

Some of them are really heavygoing. I feel a bit traumatized by the characters&#39;s life and experience.</p> <p>So I am looking for some novels that are easier to read, maybe hilarious, and non-fiction (preferably modern time), such as light novels, but not too fan-service like many romantic ones or lowbrow. I&#39;m interested in books that help me think positively, not looking life through rose-colored glasses. Something like To kill a mocking bird by Harper Lee or Don Quixote is suitable.</p> <p>Thank you in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/AndyRay07\"> /u/AndyRay07 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1h78gx9/slice_of_life_lightweight_books_to_find/\">[",

Among them are 1984, Animal Farm, The Collector, All Quiet on the Western Front, Master and Margarita, Metamorphosis, and Meditations.</p> <p>Most other books felt outdated, unimportant, or shallow. They didn\u2019t change me or bring something meaningful to my life. I feel like I could\u2019ve skipped them without missing anything significant. I even tried several masterpieces, but I often felt this sense of unimportance\u2014for example, while reading Anna Karenina, Crime and Punishment, Philosophical Dictionary, The Odyssey, An American Tragedy, and The Decameron.</p> <p>I just finished another Charles Dickens book, A Tale of Two Cities, and it also felt outdated and shallow.</p> <p>My question is: How can I pick books and not be disappointed?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/laudanumn",

Like I watched countless video essays and documentaries on people like Nietzsche and Arthur Sophureneher, their thought process fascinated me to no end, then I discovered people like Kafka and Dostovesky from Jordan Peterson (put your political views aside, I too disagree on some points but nonetheless he&#39;s good at debating) and their work of fiction as depicted by lectures from JP, as he explained the whole psychic of Roskolnikov, it just made me curious to read. </p> <p>So I bought Crime and Punishment from Amazon, 2 page, then 4 page and on 6th page I just lost where I began. Same with Kafka&#39;s book Trial, my friend gave me the book and I just got lost in storyline. </p> <p>However, I just wondered, Am i aiming too high?
