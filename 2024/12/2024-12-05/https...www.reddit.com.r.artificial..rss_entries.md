<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey r/artificial </p> <p>I’ve been exploring tools for building and managing AI workflows, especially for applications powered by LLMs. Along the way, I’ve often felt the frustration of juggling multiple tools that don’t quite fit together seamlessly.</p> <p>To address this, I ended up building something that simplifies the process end-to-end (it’s called Athina).</p> <p>Here’s what it helps you do:</p> <ul> <li>Test &amp; version control prompts</li> <li>Build multi-step AI workflows</li> <li>Manage datasets with a spreadsheet UI</li> <li>Run evaluations on datasets or CI/CD</li> <li>Compare outputs across prompts/models</li> <li>Monitor traces, evaluations, &amp; regressions.</li> </ul> <p>And so much more...</p> <p>I’d love to know—how are you all handling prompt testing, dataset management, or workflow automation in your AI projects? What tools or strategies do you use?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I stumbled on this old 2015 conversation between Elon Musk and Sam Altman, and it’s kind of mind-blowing to see how different their outlooks were back then, especially on AI.</p> <p>It’s wild to hear the foundations of what would eventually become OpenAI and to realize how much both of them (and the tech world) have evolved since that time.</p> <p>I pulled out a few of the most interesting snippets and shared them over on my Twitter (X) account—no heavy self-promo intended, just thought some of you might appreciate these highlights if you don’t have time to watch the full thing.</p> <p>Clips: <a href="https://x.com/ahmetdedeler101/status/1864774581006877021">https://x.com/ahmetdedeler101/status/1864774581006877021</a><br/> The Full Podcast: <a href="https://youtu.be/SqEo107j-uw">https://youtu.be/SqEo107j-uw</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ahmett9"> /u/ahmett9 </a> <br/> <span><a href="http
