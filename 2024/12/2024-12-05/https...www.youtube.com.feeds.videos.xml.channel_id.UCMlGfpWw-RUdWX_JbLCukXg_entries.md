Leveraging C++20/23 Features for Low Level Interactions - Jeffrey Erickson - CppCon 2024
---

Low level interactions are a core part of embedded implementations. All too often, C++ developers rely on C constructs and interactions due to prior biases around language support.  Herein we present effective leveraging of C++20 and C++23 constructs in an embedded driver code base. From using an existing C driver more effectively with modern C++ smart pointers to leveraging constexprs for bit and byte manipulation in the standard library, we will go over how you can stay on the cutting edge of the C++ language evolution in the embedded space.
