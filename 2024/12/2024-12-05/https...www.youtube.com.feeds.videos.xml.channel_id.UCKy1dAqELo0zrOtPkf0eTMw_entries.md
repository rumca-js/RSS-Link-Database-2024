Dragon Age: The Veilguard finally debuted this Halloween, concluding with an intense final act full of shocking twists and devastating consequences. Unsurprisingly, choice and consequence both ended up being integral threads in the fabric of the game. Whether it’s sacrificing one city to save another, deciding the future of the griffins, or, yes, choosing just what happens to our bald elven antagonist Solas, you’re making some pretty big moves on the continent of Thedas.

Fans have been quick to theorize what we might expect in a potential Dragon Age 5, especially after the massive reveals we got in this installment of the series. While DA5 remains unconfirmed and Bioware currently has no plans to release DLC for The Veilguard, questions linger about the future of Thedas now that the war with the elven gods has seemingly come to an end.

With the dust settled, IGN sat down with Dragon Age Creative Director John Epler and Game Director Corinne Busche in a 45-minute conversation to dis

Secret Level, reviewed by Steven Nguyen Scaife. Narrated by Alan Wheeler.

If Secret Level isn’t quite a transparent marketing ploy, it still falls victim to the sort of fatigue that results from mainlining one video game trailer after another. Beyond a few highlights, it is too often a humorless smear of action-heavy conflict that fails to convey the breadth of the medium, all while suffering the usual pitfalls of the anthology format. If nothing else, the series accurately represents what a season of Love, Death, and Robots might be like if it were all about brands.
