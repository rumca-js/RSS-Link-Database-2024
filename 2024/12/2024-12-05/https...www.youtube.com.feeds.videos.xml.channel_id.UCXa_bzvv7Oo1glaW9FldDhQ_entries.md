Cyberpunk 2077, Starfield, Star Wars Outlaws, Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, S.T.A.L.KE.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl- the list of games that launch with major technical issues for some reason or another is, unfortunately, a long one, and not only is it growing longer by the day, but it’s also doing so at an alarming pace. 

Even if games are decidedly better looking, more ambitious, and more complex than ever before in a multitude of ways, in this specific area, things only seem to be backsliding with no signs of recovery.

The reasons are many, but more of them point to crippling issues within the games industry and the direction it’s headed in at large- here, we discuss all of that and manner.

CD Projekt Red have confirmed that they will not be produced a PS5 Pro patch for Cyberpunk 2077. The decision surprises many given the game’s reputation for technological boundary pushing, but CD Projekt Red – whilst not wholly explaining their decision – do have reasonable excuses for considering their work on Cyberpunk 2077 complete. 

First, they’ve numerous other big projects in the production pipeline so it could be a case of not wanting to take manpower away from their next titles. They’ve already released a free patch in the form of the 2.0 update too: an update presenting a seismic overhaul over its predecessor. This feature explores these reasons more in-depth and proposes what a PS5 Pro patch might entail should CD Projekt Red ever backtrack.
