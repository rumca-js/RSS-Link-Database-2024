        "description": "Cyberpunk 2077, Starfield, Star Wars Outlaws, Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, S.T.A.L.KE.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl- the list of games that launch with major technical issues for some reason or another is, unfortunately, a long one, and not only is it growing longer by the day, but it\u2019s also doing so at an alarming pace. \n\nEven if games are decidedly better looking, more ambitious, and more complex than ever before in a multitude of ways, in this specific area, things only seem to be backsliding with no signs of recovery. \n\nSo why exactly is it that we\u2019re seeing an increasing number of games releasing in technically unstable conditions, and often to unacceptable extents? The reasons are many, but more of them point to crippling issues within the games industry and the direction it\u2019s headed in at large- here, we discuss all of that and manner.",

        "description": "CD Projekt Red have confirmed that they will not be produced a PS5 Pro patch for Cyberpunk 2077. The decision surprises many given the game\u2019s reputation for technological boundary pushing, but CD Projekt Red \u2013 whilst not wholly explaining their decision \u2013 do have reasonable excuses for considering their work on Cyberpunk 2077 complete. \n\nFirst, they\u2019ve numerous other big projects in the production pipeline so it could be a case of not wanting to take manpower away from their next titles. They\u2019ve already released a free patch in the form of the 2.0 update too: an update presenting a seismic overhaul over its predecessor. This feature explores these reasons more in-depth and proposes what a PS5 Pro patch might entail should CD Projekt Red ever backtrack.",
