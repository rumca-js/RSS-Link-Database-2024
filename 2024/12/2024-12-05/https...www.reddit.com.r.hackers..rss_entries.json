I used the key 3 times before Xbox promoted me to use the password. I don&#39;t have the password since it was his... now I&#39;m stuck trying to log into my old account and dealing with Microsoft shitty support since you can never call anyone for help they just send you online for online support.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Aware-Assistant-2526\"> /u/Aware-Assistant-2526 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/hackers/comments/1h7md5n/old_xbox_account/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/hackers/comments/1h7md5n/old_xbox_account/\">[comments]</a></span>",
