Because of that I wanted to buy him a really nice board game this year for Christmas, but I don’t know much about them. He’s already bought Catan, and Here to Slay for himself this year. He’s a lover of card based, fantasy/rpg style games that he can trick people in, but he also loves party style games. It would be nice if the game could be played with a minimum of two people so we can play together- but could also be played with a couple more in case he wants to play with friends. I don’t mind it being a lil pricy but would rather not go over $60. </p> <p>I’m not sure what else would help people help me- he loves animals but he’s also a mortician so he likes horror based stuff!

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi Board-game community,</p> <p>I might need your hive intelligence. I&#39;m currently traveling through Australia and I&#39;m trying to find the local game-stores in all the cities I&#39;m traveling. Is there any map or list out there where I can easier find the often quite hidden places? I would love to hear your recommendations.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Jim8Knopf"> /u/Jim8Knopf </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1h71r69/is_there_a_local_game_store_map/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1h71r69/is_there_a_local_game_store_map/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello all,</p> <p>I am a huge fan of Co-Op board games and turn based RPGs in general. I never really find time to play through long campaign games like Gloomhaven though physically. Also these games often have really long setup time.</p> <p>Does anyone know some good games that allow interesting builds and play like a Co-Op RPG but based around one off scenarios or short campaigns that are less than 10 hours.</p> <p>Only RPG game I can think of is Too Many Bones. It allows for build variety while playing through scenarios and always have a good time. Most similar games require long campaigns.</p> <p>I do enjoy coop card games that give similar feels like Marvel Champions, Lord of the Rings and Arkham Horror (shorter campaigns). They give the ability to &quot;build&quot; my deck and play through scenarios. </p> <p>Marvel United is another good example of an scenario based RPG fell, but it doesn&#39;t have any build variety but makes up for it with a

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;d like to gift my dad some sort of game we can remote play together. He&#39;s in america, I&#39;m in Korea. He is former military. He lives alone and I&#39;d like to play a game with him across the world. One he can set up on a table and look at when I send a move. But with decks of cards and dice rolls, I&#39;m very unfamiliar with how people do this. What advice do you have? Is there a good 2 player remote game, maybe a war or COIN game, that we can spend a good amount of time on? </p> <p>Any and all advice is greatly appreciated.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/StuTeacher82"> /u/StuTeacher82 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1h6wjy6/remote_play_with_dad_need_help/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1h6wjy6/remote_play_with_dad_need_help/">[comments]</a></span>
