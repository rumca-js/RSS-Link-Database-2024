So whoever read the initial outline for Prime Video's imminent gaming-inspired animated anthology and pitched <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-reportedly-working-on-animated-anthology-tv-series-featuring-spelunky-and-other-video-game-worlds">Secret Level</a> as the title deserves a shoutout. It's short, snappy and succeeds at putting a general audience in mind of video games while also hinting at something exciting and mysterious. Crucially, it also communicates that this series will build on something that already exists: a little extra treat. </p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/four-episodes-of-amazons-secret-level-anthology-hints-at-a-rich-visual-picknmix-but-is-that-enough">Read more</a></p>

## Writing WipEout, one of gaming's most enduring, vivid worlds

<img src="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/wipeout-manual-header.png?width=1920&height=1920&fit=bounds&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp" /> <p>Have you ever chewed fog? Of the many pleasures that games have given us, I'm not sure that I can recall it. Even in the clammier moments of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a>, when the mists bulge and bruise with all manner of malevolence, I couldn't tell you what it tastes like. The question arises because of a booklet, that of WipEout, for the PlayStation, which briskly summarises the joys within: "Pick the team you want to race for. take control of your souped-up anti-gravity racer. then ride the six huge circuits leaving the rest to chew the fog." Note the lack of capital letters at the launch of each sentence. In this world, there is never such thing as a <em>full</em> stop.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/writing-wipeout-one-of-gamings-most-enduring-vivid-worlds">Read more</
