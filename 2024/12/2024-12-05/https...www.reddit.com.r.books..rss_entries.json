It seems like Clark is using him as a justification for the more straightforward prose sections &amp; as a good conduit for the themes (e.g. the reveal at the end that he <span class=\"md-spoiler-text\">obtained and published the girl&#39;s first-hand accounts illegally</span>), but that overall his perspective doesn&#39;t influence the &#39;truth&#39; of the story Clark is telling very much. Did anyone get a different conclusion from reading those prose sections more closely, or from the book generally?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by ",
