What are the most commonly used free and open source software (FOSS) packages? In this webinar, the team behind the third Census collaboration, “Census III of Free and Open Source Software - Application Libraries,” will discuss the findings from their study of the most common packages used at the application library level. With data from Software Composition Analysis partners FOSSA, Snyk, Sonatype, and Synopsys Cybersecurity Research Center, the investigators from the Laboratory of Innovation Science at Harvard and the Linux Foundation captured detailed results of FOSS usage and key patterns of this usage that will help enhance the security of these packages, including changes since the previous Census II report.
