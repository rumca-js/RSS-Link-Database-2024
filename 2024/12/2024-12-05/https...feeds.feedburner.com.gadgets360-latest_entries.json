        "description": "A study published in Nature Communications predicts the Arctic Ocean could face its first ice-free day as early as 2027, marking a critical environmental milestone. Conducted using 11 climate models and 366 simulations, the research highlights the urgent need for emission reductions. The loss of sea ice in the Arctic exacerbates global warming through the albedo effect, and the region is already warming four times faster than the global average.",

This conclusion highlights the stark contrast between Venus and Earth, and upcoming missions from NASA and ESA aim to further explore the planet\u2019s history",

        "description": "A study published in Royal Society Open Science explores how changes in ocean density influence marine plankton, particularly the foraminifera species Trilobatus trilobus, in incorporating carbon into their shells. These organisms play a key role in the carbon cycle by sequestering carbon in the ocean floor after death. The study, led by Dr Stergios Zarkogiannis from the University of Oxford, reveals that melting ice sheets and freshwater influx reduce ocean density, impacting plankton's calcification process.",

        "description": "A study published in the European Journal of Archaeology proposes that slate plaques from the Late Neolithic and Copper Age Iberian Peninsula (3200\u20132200 BC) served as non-verbal genealogical records. The plaques, found in tombs across Portugal and Spain, were engraved with intricate geometric patterns and may have indicated clan affiliations and ancestral lineage. Research led by Prof. Katina Lillios suggests these plaques were likely used by elites, possibly to manage marriage alliances, property and burial rights.",

Despite encountering technical challenges with GPS units, the CubeSats successfully began transmitting data in mid-2024. The first data products were made available in October 2024, marking the first systematic quantification of far-infrared radiation from the poles.
