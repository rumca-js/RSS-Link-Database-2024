<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>hello! a couple months ago my cousin (cishet man in late 20s) told me excitedly that he got into the routine of reading about stoicism every morning and also showed me the chapter of that day, which worried me a little. i don‘t want him to fall into the trap of that sort of hustle-culture mindset or into a toxic masculinity of not being able to express his emotions bc he thinks that makes him weak and logic rules all, as that just can‘t be healthy to his psyche yk. so does anybody have a good recommendation of a book i could gift him for christmas? he rlly enjoys reading, last year i gifted him a short story collection and he loved it. so maybe there‘s a novel that could nudge him in a different direction or maybe an anti-capitalist philosophy book?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/AirSoSweet"> /u/AirSoSweet </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1h7n7ms/antist

But one of my biggest challenges is retaining what I read and, more importantly, applying that knowledge in my daily life. If we don’t use what we learn, it can feel like a waste of time, right?</p> <p>So, I’ve been thinking about creating an app to solve this problem—something I’d first build for myself but could help others too. The idea is to use AI and principles from neuroscience to ask smart, interactive questions about the books we read. Here’s how it would work:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Intelligent Questions</strong>: The app would generate questions tailored to a specific book, focusing on helping you recall and apply its key ideas.</li> <li><strong>Interactive Responses</strong>: You’d answer these questions using voice or text, and the app would analyze your response.</li> <li><strong>Feedback and Explanation</strong>: Based on your a

I usually only read ebooks and audiobooks from the library, so I thought this would be a nice excuse to buy a pretty book. I looked around at a bookstore, and was surprised how many there were - I guess it&#39;s a huge trend, and maybe it makes me basic but I think they&#39;re awesome. 😂</p> <p>BUT most are romance, fantasy, or classics (that I&#39;ve either already read or have no interest in.) </p> <p>I&#39;m not really into these genres - does anyone know of nice editions with sprayed edges that are more like contemporary Sci-fi, speculative fiction, literary fiction, horror, or a thriller? It can <em>have</em> romance, if it&#39;s not so much like the smutty rom coms/romantasy/Bridgertonesque books that are popular (no shame if you like them, just not for me.) 🤔</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/KATE

I feel a bit traumatized by the characters&#39;s life and experience.</p> <p>So I am looking for some novels that are easier to read, maybe hilarious, and non-fiction (preferably modern time), such as light novels, but not too fan-service like many romantic ones or lowbrow.

I’ve tagged this romance because I enjoy having a romance plot line in my books, but it doesn’t need to! </p> <p>Currently curating the selection of books I want to read during winter break. I’m a Native American studies grad student, and I’d love to find some fictional novels about Indigenous Americans pre/early contact period. </p> <p>Preferably very adventurous with a traditional heroes arc as opposed to a more biopic/diary style fiction. Romance or fantasy aspects are welcome! Nothing too gruesome or dark (Obviously there were literal genocides that occurred because of colonization, and dark topics may be unavoidable depending on the time period, but I don’t want to read gruesome depictions of crimes.) </p> <p>( Question inspired by the book “Where They Burn Books, They Also Burn People” by Marcos Hernandez. )</p> <p>Thanks!! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/boochaplease"> /u/boochaplease

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>(I&#39;m not much familiar with this site so excuse me for not using correct tags and whatnot) </p> <p>Hey so to start off, I&#39;m a big fan of philosophy. Like I watched countless video essays and documentaries on people like Nietzsche and Arthur Sophureneher, their thought process fascinated me to no end, then I discovered people like Kafka and Dostovesky from Jordan Peterson (put your political views aside, I too disagree on some points but nonetheless he&#39;s good at debating) and their work of fiction as depicted by lectures from JP, as he explained the whole psychic of Roskolnikov, it just made me curious to read. </p> <p>So I bought Crime and Punishment from Amazon, 2 page, then 4 page and on 6th page I just lost where I began. Same with Kafka&#39;s book Trial, my friend gave me the book and I just got lost in storyline. </p> <p>However, I just wondered, Am i aiming too high? I read other books from library, like Subtle art of ..., Alchemist
