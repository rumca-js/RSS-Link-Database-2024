A study published in Royal Society Open Science explores how changes in ocean density influence marine plankton, particularly the foraminifera species Trilobatus trilobus, in incorporating carbon into their shells. These organisms play a key role in the carbon cycle by sequestering carbon in the ocean floor after death. The study, led by Dr Stergios Zarkogiannis from the University of Oxford, reveals that melting ice sheets and freshwater influx reduce ocean density, impacting plankton's calcification process.
