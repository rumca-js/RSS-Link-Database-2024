<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey</p> <p>For some reason I&#39;ve recently been having issues finding media that is not natively in english, but has english audio tracks.

For a long time it was <a href="/u/brickfrog2">/u/brickfrog2</a> . He did an incredible job, but <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/14dnl6f/future_of_rusenet_moderators_stepping_down/">he quit along with the rest of the mod team over the API changes</a>.
