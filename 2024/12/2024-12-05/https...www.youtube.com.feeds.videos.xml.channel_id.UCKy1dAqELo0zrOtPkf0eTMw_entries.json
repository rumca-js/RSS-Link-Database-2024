Narrated by Alan Wheeler.\n\nIf Secret Level isn\u2019t quite a transparent marketing ploy, it still falls victim to the sort of fatigue that results from mainlining one video game trailer after another. Beyond a few highlights, it is too often a humorless smear of action-heavy conflict that fails to convey the breadth of the medium, all while suffering the usual pitfalls of the anthology format. If nothing else, the series accurately represents what a season of Love, Death, and Robots might be like if it were all about brands.",

There's a smorgasbord of nonsensical, destructive, monster slaying loot games on the market right now and they are begging for your attention. There has never been a better moment than now to take on games like Path of Exile, Diablo 4, Last Epoch, and more. The developers of said games are locked in what seems to be a war of attrition meant to do everything in their power to create new and engaging content that keeps you coming back through the seasons and leagues. Here's why you should consider partaking in this genre. Or, here's valadation on how and why it's awesome you already no-life the endless loot grind.",
