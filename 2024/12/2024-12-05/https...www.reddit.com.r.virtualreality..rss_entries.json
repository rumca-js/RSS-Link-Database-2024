I actually wanted full body tracking for a long time but there was always something in the way. Prices aside, my living situation means I can&#39;t really use base stations, so Vive 3.0/Tundra is out. I would be somewhat warmer towards Slime trackers if not for how slowly they ship.

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hello,</p> <p>Currently, I\u2019m running a quest 3 for PCVR. I NEVER use it standalone since I don\u2019t really care about it being wireless and I don\u2019t like the graphics. Lately, i\u2019ve been wondering if I should sell the Quest 3, and buy an index instead. The quest 3 constantly runs out of battery, loses tracking, and completely stops working randomly. I\u2019ve also heard that it takes much more processing power just to use link and it just looks worse since it\u2019s not made for PCVR. I\u2019ve read that virtual desktop looks really good if you crank it up to max and i have the specs for it but i don\u2019t have great wifi. I\u2019m unsure if buying an index in 2024/2025 is a good idea, though.</p> <p>relevant specs: Asus TUF 4090 Ryzen 9 7950x3D 128GB 6000mhz</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Martijnrrtje12\"> /u/Martijnrrtje12 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1h7avm0/index_or_quest_3_f",

I would be happy to pay for time. This project isn&#39;t for money making purposes. It would be an entirely one use sentimental situation.</p> <p>Essentially I need a small walk through scene created with various building elements creating a path. The detail would not need to be massively impressive, and the size would be limited to the area I have available to physically walk in (20ft x 30ft ish). </p> <p>So I&#39;m looking for either a developer/creator with some free time who doesn&#39;t mind small jobs, or alternatively I&#39;d be happy to get some advice on where to start with making a walkthrough scene.
