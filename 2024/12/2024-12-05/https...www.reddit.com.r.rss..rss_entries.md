<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi, I’m looking for an iOS reader app supporting TTRSS and “pagination”. I would like to read long articles flipping pages rather than scrolling. Right now I use Lire, but it’s not paginated. I was looking into Reeder Classic but I can’t find info about pagination. Do you have any suggestions?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Odd-Let9042"> /u/Odd-Let9042 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1h7bmlg/ios_app_supporting_ttrss_and_pagination/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1h7bmlg/ios_app_supporting_ttrss_and_pagination/">[comments]</a></span>
