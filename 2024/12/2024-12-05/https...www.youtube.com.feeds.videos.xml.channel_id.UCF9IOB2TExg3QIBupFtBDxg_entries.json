        "description": "On November 27, 2024, heavy rainfall triggered a massive mudslide in Bulambuli, Uganda, burying villages across six areas, including Masugu, Namakyele, and Mamolo. The tragedy has claimed at least 28 lives so far, with over 125 homes destroyed and more people missing. Survivors are now grappling with urgent challenges like food shortages, lack of medical care, inadequate housing, and insufficient clothing.\n\n(We have been planting trees for fruit and to stabalise the soils as well, we hope over time this will reduce or stop land slips) \n\nIf you would like to donate to Buanga, Way to Health\n\nSend via, John Campbell, \nhttps://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=XS59XPZ527YFL\n\nOr direct to Uganda\n\nhttps://buymeacoffee.com/awmedicalvideos\n\nhttps://www.gofundme.com/f/build-inpatient-wards-for-buwanga-way-to-health-foundation\n\nLink to Wefwafwa\u2019s youtube channel, https://www.youtube.com/@WefwafwaAndrew\n\nLink to our organization's website: https://buwanga.org/\n\nTo contact Wefwafwa directl",
