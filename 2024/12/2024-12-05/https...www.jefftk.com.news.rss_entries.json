I needed to submit the slides\n several months in advance, so I tried out a new-to-me approach where the\n slides are visual support only and I finalized the text of the talk later\n on.  This does mean there are places where it would be great to have\n    additional slides to illustrate some concepts</i>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n <i>Additionally, this was the first time I gave a talk where I wrote out\n everything I wanted to say in advance.  I think this made for a much less\n engaging talk, and for future ones I'm planning to go back to speaking from\n bullets.</i>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  \n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/cbdst-2024-slide-000-big.png\"><img src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/cbdst-2024-slide-000.png\" width=\"550\" h",
