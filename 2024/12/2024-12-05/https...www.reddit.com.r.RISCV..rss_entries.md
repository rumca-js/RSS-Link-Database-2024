<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am planning on running language/multimodal models on RISC V and am unclear/skeptical of the development flow. I have these models running on Raspberry Pi. Has anyone been able to duplicate Raspberry Pi-like AI model development flow on RISC V (i.e. Python/Numpy/HF transformer/PyTorch/TFLite etc? What would be a good development board that is available in the US? If Python can&#39;t be used, should I start from compiling the source?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/andyjosh123456"> /u/andyjosh123456 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1h7fsms/ai_models_on_risc_v/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1h7fsms/ai_models_on_risc_v/">[comments]</a></span>
