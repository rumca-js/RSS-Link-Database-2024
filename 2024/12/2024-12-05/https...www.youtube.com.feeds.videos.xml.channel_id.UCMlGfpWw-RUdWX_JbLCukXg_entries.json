All too often, C++ developers rely on C constructs and interactions due to prior biases around language support.  Herein we present effective leveraging of C++20 and C++23 constructs in an embedded driver code base. From using an existing C driver more effectively with modern C++ smart pointers to leveraging constexprs for bit and byte manipulation in the standard library, we will go over how you can stay on the cutting edge of the C++ language evolution in the embedded space.\n---\n\nSlides: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2024/blob/main/Presentations/Leveraging_Cpp20_23_Features_for_Low_Level_Interactions.pdf\n\nSponsored by JetBrains: https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/\n---\n\nJeffrey Erickson\n\nJeffrey E Erickson works in HW/SW Codesign Architecture at Altera, an Intel company.
