Dr. Jordan B. Peterson sits down with teacher, filmmaker, and YouTuber, Warren Smith. They discuss his unexpected virality after Elon Musk retweeted a video of him teaching critical thinking. They also walk through the aftermath, Warren’s run-ins and eventual firing by administrative bureaucrats, why asking permission to take on the unknown is not needed, and how the choice to live a safe life or accept an extraordinary adventure is ultimately yours to make.
