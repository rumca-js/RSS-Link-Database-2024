<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone,</p> <p>Iâ€™m starting an AI bot project that will rely on web-scraped data and Iâ€™m trying to understand the technical risks. For example:</p> <ul> <li>Is web-scraped data generally clean, or will I need heavy preprocessing?</li> <li>Are there common risks of systems crashing if the data sources change unexpectedly?</li> <li>Can web scraping handle real-time data needs, or is it too slow/unreliable?</li> </ul> <p>Would love to hear your experiences or advice on how to manage these challenges!</p> <p>Thanks in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Benzer_60"> /u/Benzer_60 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1h76rcr/technical_risks_of_using_webscraped_data_for_an/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1h76rcr/technical_risks_of_using_webscraped_data_for_an/">[comments]</a></span>

It automates scraping job boards by finding the XPaths for job links and figuring out how pagination works.</p> <p>It currently supports job boards that:</p> <ul> <li>Have clickable links to individual job pages.</li> <li>Use URL-based pagination (e.g., example.com/jobs?query=abc&amp;pg=2 or example.com/jobs?offset=25).</li>
