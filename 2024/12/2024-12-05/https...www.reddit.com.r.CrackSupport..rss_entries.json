Opened the installer file in Steam using Proton 9.0-3 compatibility, got the whole installer UI, seems like it was working fine until it got to 99.1% and stopped at the compressing step. The time is still ticking up, so that&#39;s cool, and of course it&#39;s the step that says it&#39;s going to look like it&#39;s stuck. Am I good to close the installer and try to run the game or should I try it again, maybe with a different compatibility version?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/k1132810\"> /u/k1132810 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CrackSupport/comments/1h6xhp9/fitgirl_on_linux_wsteamproton/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CrackSupport/comments/1h6xhp9/fitgirl_on_linux_wsteamproton/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I played for about 30 minutes until an odd glitch occurred where the game wouldn&#39;t switch between mouse and keyboard icons and controller icons. I saved my progress and closed the game using Alt+F4, as I usually do. However, now every time I try to launch the game, it briefly shows a black screen before crashing.</p> <p>Since the repack installs quickly, I uninstalled and reinstalled the game while keeping my save data to avoid losing progress. Unfortunately, the issue persists. Does anyone have a solution? Should I completely wipe all the game files, or is there another fix?</p> <p>This issue might be related to Razer Cortex. On my old computer, it worked fine, but on this one, it caused significant problems. The app has an auto-optimization feature meant to improve game performance.
