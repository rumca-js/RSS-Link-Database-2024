<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Raspberry Pi OS has come a long way since its inception as Raspbian back in 2012. Along the way, the developers have pursued increasingly advanced features, such as graphics acceleration, robust graphical interfaces such as Wayland, and artificial intelligence features.</p> <p>Concurrently with the development of advanced features, the Raspbian / Raspberry Pi OS team has maintained a &quot;Lite&quot; version that excludes a windowed, GUI-based OS and accompanying libraries, but otherwise retains the Linux kernel, a terminal-based shell, and libraries that can be executed in non-GUI-based environments. Raspberry Pi OS Lite is perfect for lower-spec devices that do not have sufficient resources to execute a windowed OS, including the Raspberry Pi Zero and Zero 2. It is also excellent for projects that do not require a rich GUI environment, such as headless configurations (e.g., webservers and file servers) and single-app &quot;kiosk&quot; projects (e.g

## Is raspberry pi capable of capturing 4k video and upload it to the cloud 24/7?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I want to do a pet project where I have a 4k camera and I want to record 24/7 footage, split the videos in chunks of 5 minutes (for later reconstruction of certain time periods) and send these chunks to the cloud.</p> <p>Is a raspberry pi capable of such task? If so, what&#39;s the best way to achieve this? A capturing card?</p> <p>My idea is to run an ffmpeg script that encodes video from an external camera @4k 30fps non-stop and saves chunks every 5 minutes, and then have another process to upload the contents to a cloud service.</p> <p>I have never owned any raspberry before, so I would like some advice before spending my hard earned $$$</p> <p>I have also did some short research for the past couple days, but haven&#39;t found any satisfactory results. I either bump with cameras specific to the raspberry or I bump into turning a raspberry into a capturing device. None of these are quite what I need... </p> <p>Thanks in advance! </p> </div><!-- SC_
