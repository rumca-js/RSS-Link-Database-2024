<p>Nvidia has been instrumental in the current AI boom that’s going on, but primarily as the manufacturer of GPUs that power all the next-gen AI processing tasks. But the company isn’t content with just providing shovels to all the diggers. They’ve gone ahead and joined in the fray with their own AI model that does something truly novel.</p>



<p>Reported by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/11/nvidias-new-ai-audio-model-can-synthesize-sounds-that-have-never-existed/">Ars Technica</a>, Nvidia’s new AI model is called Fugatto and it combines new AI training methods and technologies to transform music, voices, and other sounds in ways that have never been done before, to create soundscapes never before experienced.</p>

<p>Cyber Monday is delivering some of the best deals we’ve seen in a while. The 43-inch Samsung Odyssey Neo G7 is a prime example, <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/samsung-odyssey-neo-g7-43-mini-4k-uhd-1ms-amd-freesync-premium-pro-smart-gaming-monitor-with-hdr600-black/6559079.p?skuId=6559079">now just $500 at Best Buy</a> — a massive 50 percent off its $1,000 MSRP.</p>



<p>This massive monitor was designed with gaming in mind. With its 144Hz refresh rate and 4K resolution of 3840×2160, it’s the perfect combination of sharp images and smooth visuals that gamers need to bask in immersive goodness while gaining an edge over their opponents.</p>

That’s a hair under $7,093 in American Freedom Bucks.</p>



<p>What could possibly make a PC case worth more than the price of an okay used car? Nothing. It’s nothing, okay? You can stop reading now.</p>

<p>Cyber Monday will be gone in a flash, so it’s important to swoop in now when the time is right, especially when there’s an awesome laptop deal afoot. Today, you can get the long-lasting Lenovo ThinkPad T14s Gen 6 for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lenovo-ThinkPad-T14s-Gen-6-2024/dp/B0D6YLBBZL/">just $1,343.80 on Amazon</a>. That’s over $350 off!</p>



<p>Having <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2441407/lenovo-thinkpad-t14s-gen-6-review.html">reviewed</a> this specific configuration back in September, we were absolutely floored by the battery life results. This laptop lasted almost 24 hours on a single charge, which is absolutely absurd.</p>



<p>So, why does it have such phenomenal battery life? We suspect it has something to do with its low-power display — a 14-inch 1920×1200 60Hz display that’s perfectly serviceable for day-to-day tasks but en

<p>Usually, Macs skip the deep discounts found during the holiday shopping season. Not this year! For Cyber Monday the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-2022-MacBook-Laptop-chip/dp/B0DLJ4JKHB">M2 MacBook Air with 16GB of RAM dropped to $799</a>, a rare $200 discount from its MSRP and $400 off the price it was just last month. This is <em>easily</em> the best price we’ve seen for this laptop.</p>



<p>The best part about this discount is that it makes the 16GB version of the laptop just $50 above <a href="https://www.amazon.com/2022-Apple-MacBook-Laptop-chip/dp/B0B3BVWJ6Y/">the model that sports half the RAM</a>, making the upgrade an easy pick as Apple charges $200 for the upgrade.

<p>We found the perfect power bank for outdoorsy folks. No, really, we have! Because this power bank doesn’t just have a massive capacity, but it also charges by simply being in the sun. The best part is that <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Power-Bank-Solar-Charger-42800mAh-Portable-Built-Flashlight/dp/B0C4JTVBBH?th=1">it’s only $25.90 at Amazon</a>, a good 28% under its MSRP.</p>



<p>Let’s start by saying this power bank has a 42,800mAh capacity. That’s absolutely massive! It’s enough to recharge your phone fully about eight times. This power bank has two USB-A and one USB-C port, so you can charge multiple devices at once.</p>



<p>Since durability will obviously be a concern when you’re out and about in nature, you shouldn’t worry about this power bank. It’s not only IP67 waterproof but also drop-proof and dust-proof. However, we’d probably be careful

<p>There is no joy in <s>Mudville</s> Intel’s corporate headquarters. The company has had an epically horrible year, with widespread issues plaguing its flagship chips, massive upswings from rivals AMD and Nvidia, and a stock downturn so dramatic it’s been called one of the worst performers in the industry. So, maybe it isn’t surprising that CEO Pat Gelsinger is leaving.</p>



<p>The announcement was made <a href="https://www.intc.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1719/intel-announces-retirement-of-ceo-pat-gelsinger">via press release this morning</a>, calling the move a retirement.
