<p>Amazon Web Services has updated AWS PartyRock, its mostly free low code tool for building generative AI applications with a new app search function and the ability to build document processing into applications.</p>



<p>PartyRock, otherwise known as Amazon Bedrock Playground, was introduced at last year’s AWS re:Invent conference, and the updates at this year’s event enable developers to continue experimenting with building applications underpinned by generative AI.</p>



<p>AWS had said that PartyRock is aimed at users who don’t know how to code. Other features that make the service unique among AWS services are that users don’t need an AWS account to access the service, and that it can be

Not because we’re all going to be replaced by machines, but because there are <em>so</em> many areas in the SDLC that are perfect fits for AI and again, more specifically, LLMs.</p>
