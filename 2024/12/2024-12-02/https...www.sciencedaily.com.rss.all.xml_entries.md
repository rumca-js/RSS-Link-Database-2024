Clay minerals are a major constituent of the earth's surface and are mainly found in the sediments of lakes, rivers and oceans. The properties of clay and claystone crucially depend on how the tiny sediment particles are orientated. A research team has now succeeded for the first time in observing in detail how some of the processes work.

Since the first fiber optic cables rolled out in the 1970s, they've become a major part of everything from medical devices to high-speed internet and cable TV. But as it turns out, one group of marine mollusks was way ahead of us. A new study reveals that clams called heart cockles have unique structures in their shells that act like fiber optic cables to convey specific wavelengths of light into the bivalves' tissues.

## Evidence of primordial black holes may be hiding in planets, or even everyday objects here on Earth

A theoretical study suggests that small black holes born in the early universe may have left behind hollow planetoids and microscopic tunnels, and that we should start looking within rocks and old buildings for them. The research proposes thinking both big and small to confirm the existence of primordial black holes, suggesting that their signatures could range from very large -- hollow planetoids in space -- to minute -- microscopic tunnels in everyday materials found on Earth, like rocks, metal and glass.

## Newfound mechanism may explain why some cancer treatments boost risk of heart disease

A cancer therapy that prompts the body's immune defenses against viruses and bacteria to attack tumors can make patients more vulnerable to heart attack and stroke. A possible explanation for this side effect is that the treatment interferes with immune regulation in the heart's largest blood vessels, a new study suggests.

## 'Spooky action' at a very short distance: Scientists map out quantum entanglement in protons

Scientists have a new way to use data from high-energy particle smashups to peer inside protons. Their approach uses quantum information science to map out how particle tracks streaming from electron-proton collisions are influenced by quantum entanglement inside the proton. The results reveal that quarks and gluons, the fundamental building blocks that make up a proton's structure, are subject to so-called quantum entanglement.

A new study increases our knowledge about the gut and the life of gut bacteria.

An international team has tracked at BESSY II how heavy molecules -- in this case bromochloromethane -- disintegrate into smaller fragments when they absorb X-ray light. Using a newly developed analytical method, they were able to visualize the ultrafast dynamics of this process. In this process, the X-ray photons trigger a 'molecular catapult effect': light atomic groups are ejected first, similar to projectiles fired from a catapult, while the heavier atoms -- bromine and chlorine -- separate more slowly.

## Temporary tattoo printed directly on the scalp offers easy, hair-friendly solution for measuring brainwaves

Scientists have invented a liquid ink that doctors can print onto a patient's scalp to measure brain activity. The technology offers a promising alternative to the cumbersome process currently used for monitoring brainwaves and diagnosing neurological conditions. It also has the potential to enhance non-invasive brain-computer interface applications.

## Ketone bodies: More than energy, they are powerful signaling metabolites that clean up damaged proteins
 - [https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/12/241202123528.htm](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/12/241202123528.htm)

Ketone bodies are not just about energy. These metabolites are powerful signaling molecules that have profound effects on the proteome and protein quality control in the brain. Scientists, working in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease and aging, and in the nematode C. elegans, reveal the ketone body -hydroxybutyrate interacts directly with misfolded proteins, altering their solubility and structure so they can be cleared from the brain through the process of autophagy. The work hints at a tantalizing possibility -- ketone bodies as a global treatment to restore the integrity of the proteome, addressing one of the key hallmarks of aging.
