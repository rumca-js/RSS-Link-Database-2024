<p>This astonishing docu-drama delves into the blazing rivalry between Michelangelo, Raphael and Leonardo – and Dance somehow resists the urge to ham it up to the max. Whatever you do, just don’t make a Ninja Turtles joke</p><p>There is a growing fashion in historical documentary-making for blending factual accounts with dramatised versions thereof. Royal Kill List (about the Restoration) and Royal Bastards: The Rise of the Tudors used actors to deliver both, but others prefer to use sensible people for at least the factual stuff, and the latter is the path Renaissance: The Blood and the Beauty has chosen to follow.</p><p>Here are gathered contemporary artists including Antony Gormley, Alison Lapper, biographers of the artistic colossi under discussion and art historians aplenty, along with pertinent others, such as Sarah Dunant – author of several novels about Renaissance Italy. Their role is to impart the vital facts about the careers, creations and increasingly intense rivalries o

<p>The second remake of FW Murnau’s unofficial Dracula adaptation is handsomely shot and stylised, with a forbiddingly gruesome monster, but walks the line between self-conscious and scary</p><p>Here is Robert Eggers’s avowed passion project as writer-director: a luxury-arthouse remake on a grand scale, paying homage to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/oct/24/nosferatu-eview">FW Murnau’s classic silent film from 1922</a>, the German expressionist nightmare of Count Orlok, or Nosferatu, the “evil one”, a pallid vampire living in the shadow of the Carpathian Mountains. Eggers’s film can’t quite bear to say the comedy word “Transylvania” out loud, though we get to glimpse it on a map. It is an interesting new Nosferatu for our age of pandemic fear, with some beautiful images and striking moments, particularly in the eerie moonlit hallucination sequence at the beginning, which makes the rest of the story feel slightly literal and self-conscious.</p><p>The German stage actor

<p>Defender’s domination of Manchester City striker Erling Haaland represents the contrasting paths of both clubs</p><p>Like crocuses pushing up through the soil, like a first glimpse of daffodil in spring, you know something’s up at West Ham, and indeed Everton, when David Moyes starts turning up on Match of the Day 2 like a hopeful uncle at a funeral, looking trim and urgent and chiselled, with perhaps even a slight shade of spray-salon, a touch of Ibiza Whisper.</p><p>Moyes did a thorough video debrief for the BBC of Virgil van Dijk’s defending against Erling Haaland at Anfield. This wasn’t the toughest analysis given it basically involved showing Van Dijk gliding about taking the ball away, doing Dad-defender stuff – Erling, we’ve talked about this, you’ll have to wait for Crystal Palace – and generally defanging an elite striker he just seems to have the cheat code to every time.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/dec/02/virgil-van-dijk-liverpool-keystone-spi

<p>The word ‘probably’ will haunt this fish for the rest of its days – a deflating description for a cute, toxic creature</p><p>Pufferfish are cute, and most pufferfish are toxic. Like people, they spend their weeks moving between states of puffed up and deflated. Or, really, three states: normal, puffed up, and then the hangover after the puffing up. Ironically, the pufferfish toxin, called tetrodotoxin, is deadly because it stops a person’s diaphragm from moving – in other words, it stops you from being able to puff yourself up. And you could see that as a lesson in the bravado of wanting to eat them in the first place.</p><p>You’re wondering what is inside a blown-up pufferfish, how they inflate. Firstly: it is not air, or else they would pop up and out of the water like a balloon in a swimming pool. Also, air is hard to come by down there. They turn themselves into absurd-looking spherical objects by sucking water – something called, grossly, “buccal pumping” – into their extreme

<p>Yui Kiyohara’s film of long shots and silences could be deeply boring or oddly fascinating depending on your point of view</p><p>Japanese director Yui Kiyohara is clearly a believer in time, not speed, and situation over story. For nearly two hours, with virtually no plot to speak of, her slow, drifting drama follows three women on a spring day in a suburb near Tokyo. It’s a film of long shots and long silences. The mood is difficult to pin down; challenging arthouse that tiptoes close to quirky. In places it feels almost like CCTV directed by Wes Anderson. How well you get on with it will probably depend on how you feel about watching a woman carefully sorting through a pile of mail for well over a minute.

<p>Welsh snooker player who won the world championship at his first attempt in 1979</p><p>Terry Griffiths, who has died aged 77 after suffering from dementia, became world snooker champion at his first attempt in 1979, just as the sport was transforming itself from a low-profile activity into a television attraction enjoyed by millions. A rookie pro from Llanelli who was new to TV audiences, he beat four leading players of the day, Perrie Mans, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/jul/25/alex-higgins-obituary-snooker-champion">Alex Higgins</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/nov/09/guardianobituaries.sport">Eddie Charlton</a> and Dennis Taylor, to reach the summit of the sport.</p><p>Griffiths had only turned professional the previous year, having realised that the game was beginning to provide more opportunities for fame and fortune or, at the least, a chance to earn a congenial living.

<p>Fiorentina and Inter players had squabbled over a VAR check before the hosts’ midfielder suffered a cardiac arrest</p><p>Before Edoardo Bove fell, it had seemed as though a disallowed goal was the most important thing in the world. Fiorentina and Inter were waiting for a VAR check to confirm whether the ball really had gone out as Denzel Dumfries set up Lautaro Martínez to score in the 17th minute of their top-four clash. Players and coaches voiced their disagreement in the usual theatrical terms.</p><p>And then, it did not matter at all. Bove had not involved himself in the discussion, waiting in the far half of the pitch. He dropped to a knee for a moment, presumed to be tying a shoelace, but in fact using his hands to steady himself on the turf. After standing back up, he took a handful of steps then collapsed beside Hakan Calhanoglu.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/dec/02/edoardo-bove-cardiac-arrest-fiorentina-inter-milan-serie-a">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Documentary provides a useful introduction to the country, even if the geopolitics at times are a little simplistic</p><p>Producer-director Vanessa Hope has worked on a number of films about China and its neighbouring nations, and this new one focuses on Taiwan, which is increasingly in the news as anxieties mount over a possible invasion by the People’s Republic across the Taiwan Strait. As a work of journalistic explication for interested but underinformed western viewers, it’s a bit all over the shop, although admittedly the history of the island is fiendishly complex and confusing.</p><p>We get some handy-dandy animated map-based graphics that explain how it passed through the hands of various colonialist invaders, from both Europe and Asia.

<p>The meeting with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy comes weeks after Scholz spoke with Vladimir Putin</p><p>Good morning and welcome to our coverage of Russia’s war on Ukraine. The German chancellor, <strong>Olaf Scholz</strong>, visited Ukraine for the first time in more than two and a half years on Monday.<br><br>
 The diplomatic trip comes just weeks after he was criticised by Ukrainian President <strong>Volodymyr Zelenskyy</strong> for having a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin.<br><br>
 Their call came at a time of widespread speculation about what the new administration of president-elect Donald Trump will mean for Ukraine.<br><br>
 Scholz, who is under pressure from many voters to cut aid to Kyiv, said that, in his meeting with Zelenskyy, he will announce further military supplies this month totalling €650m (£539m). Zelenskyy is set to push Nato to invite Ukraine to join the military alliance at a meeting in Brussels this week.<br><br>

<p>Edwin Frank’s finely judged survey of modern fiction from Dostoevsky to Sebald will have you reaching for novels you hadn’t thought about in years</p><p>Edwin Frank vows in his introduction to this book to try to do for the fiction of the last century what the critic Alex Ross’s landmark book <em>The Rest </em><em>Is Noise</em> did for its music. He is as good as his word. This is the most engaging imagining of the progress of the 20th-century novel you will read. Frank brings serious erudition to the task – in his day job he is editorial director of New York Review Books and has for 25 years edited its eclectic classics series which breathes new life into half-forgotten or out-of-print treasures. Though he has a fine critical judgment, Frank writes as an enthusiast at least as much as an academic, trusting his taste, always alive to the stories he is telling and the arguments he makes.</p><p>His method is broadly chronological, offering the reader a “long” 20th century, beginning

<p>Documentary shows the gruelling labour put in by a married couple wringing out drops of black gold as their son looks for a different living</p><p>In Saeed Taji Farouky’s impressionistic documentary, the act of manual labour gains a sensorial, almost celestial dimension. The film’s opening sequences are near-wordless, as the camera gazes on the Burmese village of Dahat Pin. Here, the muddy, golden-hued landscape is dotted with countless derricks, simple bamboo structures. A cacophony of cranking levers, roaring generators, and sputtering smoke plumes harmonises into a dynamic soundscape, bringing to life the operations of these hand-operated, independent oil extractors. Unique to Myanmar, these oil-fields are unregulated by the government and often face intimidation from the army.</p><p>Among those living this way are Htwe Tin and Thein Shwe, a married middle-aged couple whose daily travails constitute the film’s beating heart.

<p>The jailing of pro-democracy activists, omnipresent surveillance and a distrust of the police have driven people into a fearful silence</p><p>Growing up, I had always dreamed of becoming a police officer like my uncle. In my childhood in the 1980s and 90s, the police had a positive and brave image. I remember when I was in first or second grade, struggling with English, my uncle would tutor me. After our lessons, I would stay at his house to play.
