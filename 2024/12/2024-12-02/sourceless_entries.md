Silk was the driving force behind the opening of the Silk Road, positioning this material as a global commodity that greatly influenced the progress of human civilization. Due to the natural protein properties of silk, the internal structure and external characteristics of silk cultural relics are irreversibly destroyed during the process of burial or when passed down through the generations until the production information and material components completely disappear, making it difficult to obtain direct archaeological evidence for pinpointing the origin of silk.

Among the artifacts, one grid-like ware artifact first appeared in the Bronze Age in China. The two sides of the grid-like ware were grid-like ovals made of bronze material, and inside, there was an oval-shaped complete piece of

In urbanised landscapes, the scarcity of green spaces and increased exposure to anthropogenic noise have adverse effects on health and wellbeing. While reduced speed limits have historically been implemented to address traffic safety, their potential impact on residents’ wellbeing, especially in relation to engagement with natural soundscapes, remains understudied.

Higher levels of hedonic tone, indicative of positive mood, was noted with natural soundscapes, but diminished when combined with 40 mi/h traffic noise. Our results sho
