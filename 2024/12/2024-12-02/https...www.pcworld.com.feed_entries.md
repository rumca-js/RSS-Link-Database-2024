<p>Cyber Monday often feels like a lighter version of Black Friday. But even with many deals being sold out by today, I still purposely wait until today for select deals.</p>



<p>Why? Because for software and services, it can stretch how long I can make use of the deal. Prices drop for Black Friday, and then the deals extend into Cyber Monday. If you wait, you don’t lose out. There’s no product to run out of.</p>



<p>Each year (including this one), you’ll find me scooping up these discounts.</p>

<p>One of the most fun things you can use artificial intelligence for is image generation. You simply write a descriptive text and then the AI service creates the image you want. No special commands are required, you just type your text in plain language, for example <strong><em>A cat playing chess </em></strong>or <strong><em>A blue wallpaper for Windows 11</em></strong>. If you’re not happy with the result, just add more details.</p>



<p>You can then download the image you have created and use it however you like. Copyright only applies to material created by humans, not by machines. One of the pioneers of AI images is the Dall-E service from Open AI. It’s the same company behind the chatbot Chat GPT<strong><em> </em></strong>and you can access both services in one place. However, a more convenient way to create images is to use the Microsoft Designer se

<p>Portable solid-state drives are great, offering lots of storage and faster speeds than a USB flash drive while in a still-portable package.

<p>Whether you’re on the hunt for a lightning fast gaming rig or a Chromebook with great battery life, Cyber Monday is the best time to look for a laptop on a sweet deal. A lot of laptops can be found at a hearty discount, but some retailers tout big savings that aren’t really savings at all.</p>



<p>That’s where I come in (cue the majestic trumpets)! I’ve been overseeing PCWorld’s laptop reviews operation for years, helping our team evaluate hundreds and hundreds of notebooks of all shapes, sizes, and price points. I’ve compiled a list of worthwhile laptop deals from all over the web, from laptop manufacturers like Dell and Acer, as well as sales from online retailers like Best Buy and B&H. Not all Cyber Monday laptop deals are truly deals, but the hand-curated ones I’ve selected below certainly are.</p>

<p>The yearly fray of Cyber Monday consumerism is upon us. Yet, as I’ve been covering monitor deals in the days leading up to the post-turkey blitz, I’ve gotta say… this year’s deals are <em>especially</em> delicious.

<p>We’ve checked all of the deals below for accuracy, value, and, you know, whether they’re actually worth getting in the first place.
