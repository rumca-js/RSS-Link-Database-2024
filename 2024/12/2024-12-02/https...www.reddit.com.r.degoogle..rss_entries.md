<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been planning on moving all my Google Photos data to a hard drive (plus backups), but what really holds me back is the convenience of the map function – you get a heat map of all your photos&#39; location data, and a list with only the photos that are in the portion of the map you zoom on, that updates dynamically as you pan and zoom in and out.</p> <p>Is there anything else that can do that? I have to do it either way because I&#39;m running out of space, but I really hope I don&#39;t have to miss out on this.</p> <p>There are also other features I&#39;m less hopeful about, like photos being automatically categorized as screenshots, or it recognizing objects in the photos, and face recognition. I doubt a replacement for that exists, but it would be nice to know if it does.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Eic17H"> /u/Eic17H </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/degoogle/comm

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>EDIT: I just realised I wrote client. I mean provider!</p> <p>Hello guys and gals, as per title, I&#39;m looking for a privacy-friendly email client that doesn&#39;t feature a subscription plan.</p> <p>I&#39;m currently using Tuta (formerly Tutanota) and I love it so far, but due to its limitations, mainly re: internal search, I only use it for important matters. I&#39;m not against paying for a good software, but I don&#39;t like a subscription model, and I don&#39;t think I could afford it every year.</p> <p>Nevertheless, I do need a more practical email account for daily matters, online purchases and such. So far I&#39;ve been using gmail but I want to stop using that. Do you know any client that&#39;s reliant, privacy-focused and either free or featuring a one-time-only payment?</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/offalreek"> /u/offalreek </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddi
