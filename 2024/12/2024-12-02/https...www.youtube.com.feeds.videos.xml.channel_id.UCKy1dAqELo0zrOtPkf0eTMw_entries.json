        "description": "In today's Daily Fix:\nMarvel Rivals' roster keeps on growing, and we now have a first look at Wolverine via a new trailer. The fan-favorite mutant's new design, however, is raising some eyebrows for its lack of iconic mask and overall younger look. But purists shouldn't fret, as his more recognizable outfits will likely be coming in a season pass or other (likely paid) DLC. In other news, The PlayStation 5 just got a console software update which allows you to choose a new start-up animation and menu theme. This is part of Sony's celebration of the PlayStation's 30th anniversary, and now you can wax nostalgic while your modern PS5 boots up to the sound of the PS1's start-up animation. And finally, a trailer has leaked for a cancelled James Bond game, and no this isn't related to the upcoming Project 007 from IO interactive\u2014it's a Lego game!\n\n#IGN #Gaming #Marvel",

Despite Daisy Ridley saying only a few weeks ago that the Rey-focused Star Wars movie was \u201cevolving\u201d and we\u2019d get an update soon, the news came soon after that the next untitled Star Wars film has been yanked from its December 18, 2026, release date.\n\nAnd yet, it\u2019s not at all surprising. Regardless of anyone\u2019s thoughts on the quality of individual projects, the Disney Star Wars era has been rife with corporate mismanagement, constant second-guessing, and an inability to envision a future for the property beyond pilfering from its past. It\u2019s a sad state of affairs, but it\u2019s also what Lucasfilm has been doing for far too long, to the point that it\u2019s time we stop giving the company any credence unless they go through a serious realignment. Let\u2019s take a look at why we all need to stop paying attention to Star Wars.\n\nThe Rey movie, currently set to be directed by Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy, may",

On the other hand, some games do come out in some form, only to be pulled offline, like SEGA\u2019s Hyenas, which never made it past a public beta, or PlayStation\u2019s massive flop, Concord, which was completely taken offline just two weeks after launch.
