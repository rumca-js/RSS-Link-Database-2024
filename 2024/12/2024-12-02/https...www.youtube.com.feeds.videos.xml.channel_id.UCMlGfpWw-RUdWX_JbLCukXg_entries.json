Using Return Value Optimization for Performance in Bloomberg C++ Codebases - Michelle Fae D'Souza - CppCon 2024\n---\n\nLearn what Return Value Optimization (RVO) is, and what you can do to ensure the compiler applies it on your C++ code! This talk is open to beginner, intermediate, and advanced C++ audiences, and will be especially valuable for engineers who work on large-scale and/or high performance codebases.\n\nWhile this compiler optimization technique was first added into the C++ Standard way back in 1997, many of today\u2019s engineers have forgotten to utilize it in their production-deployed code.\n\nThis talk will dive into different perspectives as to what RVO is, including how copy elision is defined in the C++ Standard, as well as an analysis of Assembly when RVO is enabled. We will cover the different types of RVO, compiler support for it, and guidelines to help programmers ensure that the compiler uses RVO on their code. These guidelines will ",
