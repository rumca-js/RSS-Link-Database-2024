<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I received the Stardew Valley board game as a bday gift from my girlfriend. She knows I like games, and we have played a ton of Stardew together on PC (and me with an additional 200+ hrs on my own), so it was a pretty safe home-run of a gift. I was worried because, although I wanted the game when it came out (and was more readily available), I hesitated because of the mixed reviews and criticism. </p> <p>Well, we finally got around to playing it, and we actually had a great time! We played twice, back-to-back, losing the first game sorely (only completing like 2 bundles and no goals lol), and winning the second game decidedly (winning on the first turn of winter). Here are some of my takeaways:</p> <p>+ The game seemed like a lot at first, but actually flows pretty well and plays intuitively, not super hard to get going</p> <p>+ Two players was a great player count, games didn&#39;t feel too long (after getting a hang of the rules ofc)</p> <p>+ There

Blue lands two tiles south of red, and has a north exit, but can&#39;t play a tile to the north because of the wall that red has placed. On red&#39;s next turn, they move north, darkening the tile that was previously occupying the single space between blue and red. Blue now has an open space to their north. Does this immediately get illuminated? Or at the start of blue&#39;s next turn? Or not at all? When relighting occurs, the rules make it clear that relevan

Without taking over the entire post-reception time, just seeing any ideas for what would be good inclusion, maybe large group orientated games? </p> <p>We were already thinking we could have guests complete custom Chameleon game boards for our guestbook! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/llames"> /u/llames </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1h4rlzm/board_games_for_a_wedding/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1h4rlzm/board_games_for_a_wedding/">[comments]</a></span>

## Wonderlands War - resolving order?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>We played 4 rounds of WW and really enjoyed it. One thing that bugged us, though, was the resolving of everything after a battle ends. </p> <p>So you have to check what each chip does individually after battle (either back to bag, tranform etc.), smithing and checking for quests. </p> <p>In which order do you resolve all of this without messing it up? </p> <p>What I mean is, do you first Smith? But then you lose track of important active-chips-related quests. Do you first resolve chip effects? Again, may lose track of quest achievement, or you would have liked to Smith it, but you already tossed it back in the bag. </p> <p>Thanks for any suggestions :) </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Troll-or-D"> /u/Troll-or-D </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1h4q8i8/wonderlands_war_resolving_order/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/

I’m wondering, what good games are out there designed by women? I’ve found that <em>Lost Ruins of Arnak</em> is one of them (designed with her husband). The theme is appealing to me, but I haven’t played it yet. What other boardgames with solo game options would you recommend that should be taken into consideration?</p> <p>Thanks in advance! I can’t wait to learn more about the hobby :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/olibo27"> /u/olibo27 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1h4itmc/games_designed_by_women/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1h4itmc/games_designed_by_women/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi, I&#39;ve been a board game enthusiast since I was a kid, thanks to my brother, who has always loved them and introduced me to this hobby early on. His birthday is coming up, and I’d like to gift him a board game, but I need your help choosing the right one.</p> <p>Here’s what I’m looking for:</p> <ol> <li>He enjoys strategic games where you need to think carefully about your moves, but at the same time, they shouldn’t last too long (a maximum of 1 hour, maybe 1.5 hours including setup).</li> <li>It doesn’t matter if the game was released five years ago—older games are fine.</li> <li>Since I’m the only person he knows who enjoys playing board games, we usually play at home, which doesn’t have much space for games with a ton of components (like dice, maps, tiles, various pieces, etc.). As a result, we tend to play such games only once every 3–4 months.</li> </ol> <p>So, I’d love recommendations for games that meet these criteria:</p> <ol> <li>Strat
