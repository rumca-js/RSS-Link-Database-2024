So, my girlfriend got her Quest 2 shipped up to where we now live a while back, but the USPS truck that was holding the package was sprayed down by perfume. (This is common procedure for any delivery vehicles driven by people who smoke or vape.) The problem is that she has fragrance allergies, and as such is essentially unable to use the headset without having a bad reaction. We&#39;ve tried standard cleaning procedures to no avail. Even rubbing alcohol hasn&#39;t made a dent. Bleach could work, but naturally we have concerns about putting bleach on something meant for your face. If anyone has any advice, it would be highly appreciated.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/DioptaseSys\"> /u/DioptaseSys </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1h575ll/how_to_remove_perfume_from_vr_headset/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreali",

I currently have a Ryzen 7 3700x, 16gbs of Ram, and a 6GB RTX 2060. Im here because ive read conflicting reports on VR related issues for AMD cards. My VR rig consists of a Quest 2 with a USB 3 (type A) link cable for further context. As for games im trying to play, mainly Into the Radius (1 and 2) and Metro Awakening.

I\u2019m leaning towards buying my husband a VR headset, but I have no idea whatsoever about gaming myself</p> <p>For background, he loves playing his PS5, mostly soccer games and some adventure/quest games. He\u2019s in general a minimalist, and does not own a computer. He has expressed interest in VR but would never spend $300 on himself. He can totally play for hours on end and we joke his PS5 is the \u201cother woman\u201d in our relationship </p> <p>So if he only has a PS5, can I only get him the PS VR headset? Or I\u2019ve seen the Meta Quest is a great option too</p> <p>Will the games he already has and loves be compatible with VR? Will we have to purchase new games on top of buying the headset?</p> <p>Are there other potential issues I\u2019m not seeing, like is it such a personal decision I should ultimately be leaving up to him to choose which model? Do I need to buy hand accessories? I\u2019m so out of my wheelhouse here </p> </div><!-- S",

I never see that on the Quest store. It keeps popping in my face when I look for PSVR2 games.
