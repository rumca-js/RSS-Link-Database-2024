Cool. Now what if those two models were related by Generic Foreign Key? <code> one = Model_One() two = Model_Two(content_object=one) one.save() two.save() </code> Now this one does not work! Two complains that it&#39;s content_id is null. I went in the debugger. When models are instantiated, everything is at it should be, two has a field content_object that references one. But as soon as one is saved, for whatever reason two loses its reference to one, the field content_object is empty! Is this intended behavior? When I run the code below, everything is good, no",

I\u2019ve watched all of them at least ten times each ( 01/1224) but I can confidently say that if Django isn\u2019t your favourite then you are wrong ( simply it\u2019s no matter of opinion) if you watch Django unchained, the first scene of Mandingo fighting portrays 7 reactions to a murder in 3 seconds that I personally think is more valuable to modern cinematography than the 30 years that proceeds it. Honestly! Watch the eye popping scene again and again and you\u2019ll see that in 3 seconds we have 7 different societal beliefs emerge from one action.
