## Bandwidth speed knowledge eludes me :\

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I wish bandwidth speed was universal across all platforms. When I download a torrent, I get my full bandwidth of 900Mbps like 99% of the time. As long as I&#39;m not an initial seeder, its maxed out. But when I go to download a game from xbox or steam, I get around 130-200Mbps. This is all on wifi too. Every time I search anything how to improve speed, it always says to use ethernet cord. But Ill get max speed, using wifi, on a torrent everytime. But no where near even half from a big corp server. </p> <p>I did just connect up a bunch of cables to get my router to my room, from another room on the other side of my house. I am currently downloading RDR2 from steam and was getting the 130Mbps. After finally rerouting my modem and connecting the ethernet cable up, I did get 500Mbps. But only for about 3 minutes and it dropped back down to 130Mbps.. :&#39;(</p> <p>This is half rant, half wish list.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a hre

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi,</p> <p>So, weird issue, I guess. I have stremio app on Android. It is almost always locked to 3.9MBps caching speed regardless of the show I am watching. No matter what show, no matter how many seeders it got, it tops out at 3.9MBps. My internet is 100mbps, so, it should easily reach 10+ MBps, right?</p> <p>Anyway, I was looking into why that might be. Found that torrent profiles have something to do with it. So, I tried changing profile. I tried all 4 options. But there was no change. Literally no change between default, slow, fast or ultra fast profile. </p> <p>Honestly, I don&#39;t even understand how torrent profiles work. So, I am trying to figure it out here. Any ideas what might be wrong here?</p> <p>P.S. I don&#39;t even know why 3.9MBps?
