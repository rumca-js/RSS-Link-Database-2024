Basically, expose a player to the web that is playing movies from a playlist (say I ripped my Bond DVD collection years ago and want to just put them in order). No play/pause or any controls at all on the frontend, just a movie playing in a window. &quot;Dr. No&quot; ends, &quot;From Russia With Love&quot; starts. No interaction from the theoretical viewer needed or possible.</p> <p>Basically, I travel a lot and would love to have a way to put my ten favorite movies on a rotation and just be able to bring them up wherever I am, no thought, no control, just pop in mid movie and watch awhile. I know there are ways to serve playlists in Jellyfin (which I use and love), but I&#39;d like to take away all the clicking and decision making, go to &quot;bestmoviesever",

The problem is that they will quit supporting websites and mailboxes by september of 2025. We handled the website part by moving over to WordPress. But because I don&#39;t know a lot about mailboxes and all the stuff that comes with it, I have a hard time to find a good alternative. We payed mediaraven \u20ac40/year for the website and mailboxes. For our website domain we pay \u20ac4/year with us using WordPress now. So our budget would be around \u20ac40-50/year. We need emails for 16 people, 1 common mail and another one for the people leading our group of volunteers. The amount of people and thus emails will change every year and can vary between 10-30. What would you guys recommend we switch to?</p> <p>PS: I&#39;m not the one managing everything so don&#39;t know a lot about how we worked in the past. All I know is that all mails to our emai",

Whether you need a simple code for a URL or something more customizable for marketing, this site has got you covered. Plus, it offers real-time analytics, which can be super helpful for tracking engagement.</p> <p>The interface is user-friendly, and you can generate codes quickly, great for anyone who&#39;s new to QR codes or just wants to streamline the process.</p> <p>If you\u2019re curious about how QR codes can enhance your projects or business, this could be a great resource to check out!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/minemateinnovation\"> /u/minemateinnovation </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.c",

I\u2019ve also tried setting up NPM (Nginx Proxy Manager) with Authelia and Authentik, but they never seemed to play nicely in my environment.

At this point, I\u2019m getting a bit tired of searching for a simple reverse proxy with 2FA. Does anyone have any other suggestions or ideas? I\u2019d love to hear if there\u2019s anything else that might work for my setup!</p> <p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: Is there an all-in-one reverse proxy with built-in 2FA for securing website access?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"",
