Instead, I want a story that explores different stages of the characters&#39; lives, from childhood to adulthood.</p> <p>I\u2019d like each book to be a unique, self-contained adventure. The early books could have a &quot;children\u2019s book&quot; vibe, focusing on their pre-teen escapades. Then, the series could evolve with their lives: one book might explore their college adventures, another could be a detective story, followed by a war narrative where the characters are conscripted. Later entries could delve into supernatural horror, science fiction, and beyond, each reflecting a distinct genre while maintaining continuity in the characters&#39; journey.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32",

I also came across the Book Riot article &quot;Why More Men Should Read Romance,&quot; which talks about how romance novels can help men better understand communication, empathy, and the challenges women face.</p> <p>I\u2019m not into anime, sci-fi, or fantasy, but I\u2019m looking for books that focus on relationships, and emotional intelligence, or simply help broaden my understanding of women\u2019s experiences. Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!</p> <p>FYI: ",

Though most series I&#39;ve watched are all adaptations of books and people have been promising since years that books are actually even better than those adaptations we see on TV like on a whole another level. Besides adaptations my friends have been recommending books to me for years and promising I will not see life the same way after I read them.</p> <p>But the problem is I have ADHD the moment I start to read a book I get impatient, get distracted and lose track of what I&#39;m reading and my brain takes a while to rewind. This happens to me during watching TV too but I somehow manage and my brain sometimes goes into hyperfocus mode.</p> <p>Are books worth it? How different is the feel of the reading a book you&#39;re hooked to than watching a series or movie. One thing I can think of is on TV we&#39;re shown what they want us to see but whi",

It was very powerful in a way that it showed themes of self-expression, dealing with grief and loss, and at the same time, not shy to stick and depict how harsh life can be. Most importantly, it showed how we humans (no matter how long we already grieve) naturally long for our lost loved ones unconsciously to cope and heal. I love those kind of painful books. It is very natural and raw, and I love the art of grief and the beauty that accompanies when one conquers grief and loss. </p> <p>Can you guys recommend books that are immensely painful like these two books? Although the books I just read are both poetry, I&#39;d also love to read fictional books since I&#39;m expanding my taste.

The stories or the books have to be for adults and not for kids.
