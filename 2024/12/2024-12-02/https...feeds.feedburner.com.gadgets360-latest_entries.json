        "description": "A group of researchers have developed an artificial intelligence (AI) system that can protect users from undesired facial scanning by bad actors. Dubbed Chameleon, the AI model uses a special masking technology to generate a mask that hides the faces in images without impacting the visual quality of the protected image. Additionally, the researchers claim that the model is resource-optimised, making it usable even with limited processing power.",

Dubbed SmolVLM (where VLM is an acronym for vision language model), it is a compact-sized model that is focused on efficiency. The company claims that due to its smaller size and high efficiency, it can be useful for enterprises and AI enthusiasts who want AI capabilities without investing a lot in its infrastructure.",

        "description": "Efforts to protect Earth from asteroid impacts have made significant strides, notably with NASA\u2019s DART mission, which successfully altered the orbit of the asteroid moonlet Dimorphos in 2022. This achievement marked a key advancement in planetary defence, demonstrating that asteroid deflection is a viable strategy. However, the success of DART also highlighted the limitations in detection technology. The proposed NEO Surveyor, designed to improve asteroid detection, faced delays due to budget cuts, and the loss of the Arecibo Observatory further impacted monitoring efforts. Experts stress the importance of global cooperation and reinvestment in asteroid defence systems, including enhanced detection capabilities and preparedness for potential social, political, and economic disruptions in case of an asteroid threat.",
