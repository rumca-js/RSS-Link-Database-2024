<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone!</p> <p>I’m planning to make a pair of handmade crochet gloves as a gift for someone special, but I’ve never crocheted before. My goal is to complete it before 10th December, so I have about a week and a half to learn and finish. I would love some advice on how to get started and make this gift truly special!</p> <p>Here are my ideas so far:</p> <p>• Color Scheme: Black gloves with a small red heart on them.</p> <p>• Skill Level: I’m a total beginner, so any beginner-friendly patterns or tutorials would be amazing.</p> <p>• Additional Details: I want the gloves to feel cozy, thoughtful, and unique. Do you think adding something like a name initial, or perhaps a matching gift (e.g., a scarf) would make it even better?</p> <p>I’d love to see pictures of similar handmade crochet gloves for inspiration or links to patterns/tutorials that might help. Also, if you have any tips for beginners (like tools or techniques I should use), please share
