<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi! So, my girlfriend got her Quest 2 shipped up to where we now live a while back, but the USPS truck that was holding the package was sprayed down by perfume. (This is common procedure for any delivery vehicles driven by people who smoke or vape.) The problem is that she has fragrance allergies, and as such is essentially unable to use the headset without having a bad reaction. We&#39;ve tried standard cleaning procedures to no avail. Even rubbing alcohol hasn&#39;t made a dent. Bleach could work, but naturally we have concerns about putting bleach on something meant for your face. If anyone has any advice, it would be highly appreciated.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/DioptaseSys"> /u/DioptaseSys </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1h575ll/how_to_remove_perfume_from_vr_headset/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreali

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>There is a black Friday Deal for the PSVR2 at 350 USD. I&#39;m currently using the Meta Quest 2, but it gets really blurry, and PC games don&#39;t really look that good to me. I have heard that the Quest 3 looks really good with the pancake lenses, but the OLED display on the PSVR2 also intrigues me. Is it worth it at this price or should I try and get something else? I do have a PS5 I could use with it as well, but there isn&#39;t much on the PS catalog that piques my interest, tbh. I have a 4080 and a 7800x3D if that matters.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello there!</p> <p>I&#39;m looking for a VR headset primarily for PCVR use, especially for games like <em>Assetto Corsa</em>. I’ve been considering the Pico 4, which seems like a solid option for the price, but I’m a bit unsure about whether the higher-priced 256GB version is worth it.</p> <p>Since I’ll mostly be using it for PCVR (games like <em>Assetto Corsa</em> or other SteamVR titles), is the extra storage actually useful in this case? Or would the base model suffice?</p> <p>Also, would the Meta Quest (Quest 2 or 3) be a better option overall? I’d really appreciate any advice or recommendations!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/cornadon"> /u/cornadon </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1h4yewi/looking_for_advice_on_a_vr_headset_for_pcvr_newbie/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1h4yewi/looking_for_a

## Breachers control point mode is actually fun!

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I know Breachers is meant to be Rainbow6 in vr. Where tactical infiltration is the point of the game. But it is also the most boring mode if you are new to the game. Getting used to the guns and aiming can take you while in that mode. </p> <p>So I found that starting off with control point is the best way to enjoy the game. it is a lot more fast paced and great way to beat the learning curve. </p> <p>You can use all your gadgets and guns like you would in search and destroy. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/FewPossession2363"> /u/FewPossession2363 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1h4nksk/breachers_control_point_mode_is_actually_fun/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1h4nksk/breachers_control_point_mode_is_actually_fun/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Ive seen a lot of psvr2 vs quest 3 discussions understandably considering the prices are similar. The consensus for most ive seen is that the quest 3 is better particularly cause of pancake lens. Now I&#39;m curious with the psvr 2 discounted to 350 for the holidays, putting it closer to the quest 3s, what would you guys say wins out at that price point between the 3s and psvr2.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Suaremente"> /u/Suaremente </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1h4lz70/for_the_price_quest_3s_or_psvr2/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1h4lz70/for_the_price_quest_3s_or_psvr2/">[comments]</a></span>

## Gifting husband VR headset - I truly have no clue what I’m doing

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello! Thanks for any and all help! I’m leaning towards buying my husband a VR headset, but I have no idea whatsoever about gaming myself</p> <p>For background, he loves playing his PS5, mostly soccer games and some adventure/quest games. He’s in general a minimalist, and does not own a computer. He has expressed interest in VR but would never spend $300 on himself. He can totally play for hours on end and we joke his PS5 is the “other woman” in our relationship </p> <p>So if he only has a PS5, can I only get him the PS VR headset? Or I’ve seen the Meta Quest is a great option too</p> <p>Will the games he already has and loves be compatible with VR? Will we have to purchase new games on top of buying the headset?</p> <p>Are there other potential issues I’m not seeing, like is it such a personal decision I should ultimately be leaving up to him to choose which model? Do I need to buy hand accessories? I’m so out of my wheelhouse here </p> </div><!-- S

I never see that on the Quest store. It keeps popping in my face when I look for PSVR2 games. Who knows it&#39;s probably pretty good too.</p> <p>There&#39;s even bigger cash grabs and a few one man indie games that are sitting there right next to the elite like Resident Evil 8.</p> <p>I bet those guys did good too.
