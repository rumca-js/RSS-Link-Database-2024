Efforts to protect Earth from asteroid impacts have made significant strides, notably with NASA’s DART mission, which successfully altered the orbit of the asteroid moonlet Dimorphos in 2022. This achievement marked a key advancement in planetary defence, demonstrating that asteroid deflection is a viable strategy. However, the success of DART also highlighted the limitations in detection technology. The proposed NEO Surveyor, designed to improve asteroid detection, faced delays due to budget cuts, and the loss of the Arecibo Observatory further impacted monitoring efforts. Experts stress the importance of global cooperation and reinvestment in asteroid defence systems, including enhanced detection capabilities and preparedness for potential social, political, and economic disruptions in case of an asteroid threat.
