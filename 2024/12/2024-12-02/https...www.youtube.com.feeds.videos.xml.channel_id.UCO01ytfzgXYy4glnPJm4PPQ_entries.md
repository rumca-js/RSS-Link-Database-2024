Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Joe Biden proves—yet again—that he is as dishonest as he is corrupt. After repeatedly promising that he wouldn't, he just issued a pardon to his son, Hunter—but it's even worse than it sounds. In many ways, this pardon is unprecedented in American history. We'll discuss. Also, the New York Times is so desperate to smear Trump's pick for Secretary of Defense that they've now stooped to publishing private emails between Pete Hegseth and his mom. And, Pete Buttigieg gives his recipe for reducing violent crime. Apparently, crime has nothing to do with fatherless homes and everything to do with bad drinking water.
