<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi, I would like to develop code for RISC-V based ESP32 family SoCs (ESP32-C6) and I don&#39;t know which emulator or simulator would be the best for that. I&#39;ve used RARS and Ripes to learn the ISA but I&#39;m looking for something more robust that allows me to work focusing on ESP32, to have a model as close as possible to the real SoC in which I can polish my code. </p> <p>I&#39;ve looked at options like QEMU, Gem5 and Spike, but I&#39;d like to know your opinion based on your experience of use. Any feedback is welcome!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/kinotron27"> /u/kinotron27 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1h4shch/emulator_or_simulator_for_esp32_family/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1h4shch/emulator_or_simulator_for_esp32_family/">[comments]</a></span>
