<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Tl;dr: a flawed but competent conclusion to a competent but flawed epic fantasy series. 3/5 stars</p> <p>(I know that sounds like damning with faint praise, and I suspect the rest of this review will reinforce that perception, but it’s not meant to be. Not everything is going to be a genre-redefining masterpiece, and that’s okay.)</p> <p>--</p> <p>The Witch-Queen of Redwinter is the third and final book of the Redwinter trilogy, and in this capacity it is… fine. In what I will admit is a somewhat frosty approbation, this series is a competent and digestible fantasy epic. It is only three books (which, while not short, are not especially long), has a fairly manageable cast of characters, and doesn’t expect you to engage with a massive backstory or body of lore.</p> <p>The last point, to be clear, is not a demerit. The world-building in a lot of epic fantasy is generic and self-indulgent, displaying neither the creativity nor the thematic resonance of

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I just picked up the three &quot;main&quot; volumes of Elric from the Kindle market. I got an itch to read them and was feeling nostalgic for some classic swords &amp; sorcery fantasy before I dive into Sanderson&#39;s new Stormlight book in a few days. I hadn&#39;t read the main sequence of Elric (six books that, compared to modern behemoths, are almost novellas instead of novels) for probably 35 years, so it felt like a good time.</p> <p>It got me to wondering what it was that was so different, and as I&#39;m reading them, I&#39;ve figured it out. While there are recurring characters, the books fundamentally have a cast of one: Elric of Melnibone (it might be argued Stormbringer is a character, but that gets pretty esoteric). He&#39;ll link up with past acquaintances in his travels through the Young Kingdoms, but it&#39;s still primarily just about him. This is a huge contrast with the ensemble casts you find in more modern works like Sanderson, Jo

Arise! Arise, riders of Theoden. Spears shall be shaken. Shields shall be splintered. A sword day, a red day, ere the sun rises. Ride now, ride now. Ride for ruin and the world’s ending.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I didn’t totally know what to expect from this book when I first picked it up, but it was not this. Based off of the description that I saw, I was expecting something… I don’t know, slightly cozier, if that makes sense? Like, obviously not full on cozy fantasy since there is literally a war mentioned in the description, but I was imagining something kind of like a campier, more tongue-in-cheek version of 16 Ways to Defend a Walled City, like with a curmudgeonly protagonist who wants to just live a quiet life but has to balance managing a siege on top of “his stableboy apprentice, moody pregnant girlfriend, and sex wizard ex girlfriend” or whatever the summary said</p> <p>Instead, the book turned out to be a bit more serious and less satirical than that, but that’s fine, I’m on board for a classic adventure.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Was recently watching DOTA 2: Dragon&#39;s Blood, better than I thought it would be. </p> <p>Without getting into spoilers one of the major themes of the series, and the final season in particular, is the idea of fighting against fate and how trying to do so often leads to more harm than good. That the world isn&#39;t fair but that if you always try to change it to suit you that you just makes things worse. At some point there&#39;s a need to recognize that the world isn&#39;t fair and that we need to learn to accept what is and has been. But it&#39;s not fatalistic or morose about it, the acceptance of these things is portrayed in a positive light for the characters and the world.</p> <p>I feel like it&#39;s not a common theme I see in modern writing--that they tend to be big on either defying fate successfully or making the acceptance of fate actually give you everything you wanted. Here that is not the case.</p> <p>Any recommendations for good sto
