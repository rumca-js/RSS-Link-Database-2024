After about 15 mins of trying and several game overs I haven&#39;t even beat the first stage yet. Like... They give you no breathing room to learn the controls and gameplay first, so the tankier enemies will instantly cause you issues (due to the hp they have and the fact they are often placed on slopes/behind geometry, making them harder to hit). The flying enemies also catch you off guard sometimes, they are more agile than you&#39;d think. IDK man, maybe I&#39;m just really bad at run &#39;n gun gameplay (Contra Hard Corps is utterly impossible, but badass).
