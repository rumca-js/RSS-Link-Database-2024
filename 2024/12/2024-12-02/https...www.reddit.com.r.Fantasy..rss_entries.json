I hadn&#39;t read the main sequence of Elric (six books that, compared to modern behemoths, are almost novellas instead of novels) for probably 35 years, so it felt like a good time.</p> <p>It got me to wondering what it was that was so different, and as I&#39;m reading them, I&#39;ve figured it out. While there are recurring characters, the books fundamentally have a cast of one: Elric of Melnibone (it might be argued Stormbringer is a character, but that gets pretty esoteric). He&#39;ll link up with past acquaintances in his travels through the Young Kingdoms, but it&#39;s still primarily just about him.

So how do others circumvent their addictions to the cosmere or other great fantasy worlds when they aren\u2019t able to read?
