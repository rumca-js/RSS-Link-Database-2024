## Looking for a book series focusing on a single or group of protagonists and each book is a different genre

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m looking for a book series that follows the same main characters within a continuous timeline—unlike something like the animated series <em>Aeon Flux</em>, where the main character dies at the end of each episode and the episodes aren&#39;t connected. Instead, I want a story that explores different stages of the characters&#39; lives, from childhood to adulthood.</p> <p>I’d like each book to be a unique, self-contained adventure. The early books could have a &quot;children’s book&quot; vibe, focusing on their pre-teen escapades. Then, the series could evolve with their lives: one book might explore their college adventures, another could be a detective story, followed by a war narrative where the characters are conscripted. Later entries could delve into supernatural horror, science fiction, and beyond, each reflecting a distinct genre while maintaining continuity in the characters&#39; journey.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Why repost because my old post got removed due to an article link I wanted to paste </p> <p>Hi everyone! Most of my life has been about reading engineering books, self-help, or philosophy. I’ve recently decided to explore fiction, particularly stories that offer insights into relationships and women’s perspectives.</p> <p>I read <em>It Ends with Us</em> and <em>It Starts with Us</em> recently and appreciated how it highlighted the emotional depth and the complexities of relationships. I also came across the Book Riot article &quot;Why More Men Should Read Romance,&quot; which talks about how romance novels can help men better understand communication, empathy, and the challenges women face.</p> <p>I’m not into anime, sci-fi, or fantasy, but I’m looking for books that focus on relationships, and emotional intelligence, or simply help broaden my understanding of women’s experiences. Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!</p> <p>FYI:

I would like it to treat on historical events and life in general, but especially on philosophy, science, and culture, such as Sir Francis Bacon and Isaac Newton. References to the history of other European countries are welcome.</p> <p>I would prefer a book written before, say, the 1970s, since I prefer an older linguistic style when reading, and I have noticed a significant difference in style between 21st century and early 20th century writing. I would want the style of the book to be scholarly and dignified, using advanced vocabulary. Does anybody know such a book?

I almost never read them, with one notable exception being Agassi’s Open. Interesting as I’m a tennis enthusiast, written really well - not very heavy on lessons but has a lot on sacrifice, pursuing someone else’s goals, the pressure of performance and finding yourself..</p> <p>Looking forward to your thoughts 🙂</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/redditugo"> /u/redditugo </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/

I don&#39;t like romance, and am not a big fan of coming of age stories either. Favorite (alive) author is Margaret Atwood.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Just read two books by ocean vuong (Night Sky w exit wounds &amp; time is a mother). I was deeply crushed, and I love it LOL. It was very powerful in a way that it showed themes of self-expression, dealing with grief and loss, and at the same time, not shy to stick and depict how harsh life can be. Most importantly, it showed how we humans (no matter how long we already grieve) naturally long for our lost loved ones unconsciously to cope and heal. I love those kind of painful books. It is very natural and raw, and I love the art of grief and the beauty that accompanies when one conquers grief and loss. </p> <p>Can you guys recommend books that are immensely painful like these two books? Although the books I just read are both poetry, I&#39;d also love to read fictional books since I&#39;m expanding my taste.

Like the story about MMC stays in the marriage because of some agreement and nit because of love even though he tries his best please the FMC although FMC doesnt know about agreement. She thinks he loves her... then there is another man she is obsessed over but she has never crossed the line as the other man only saw her as a little sis but this obsession broke their marriage and now she has realised what she did and on her redemption arc..... everything was good until that half assed ending. They end up separated so I kinda hate it....</p> <p>But I would appreciate any recommendation similar to this but with ending up together of course and pls no crossing the line (sex with other man)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/RishamR"> /u/RishamR </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1h4p3rk/book_

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all! So audiobooks have changed my dad’s life recently. He has a degenerative eye condition and was born legally blind. He loves to read, but it’s always been slow going for him and is getting harder as his vision deteriorates. I finally got him into audiobooks and he’s so excited! He is in his early 60s and has gone from finishing a book or two every year to finishing multiple in a span of weeks.</p> <p>As a result, he’s quickly burned through all the book recs I gave him ages ago. We have pretty different tastes, so I’d like to know if anyone who knows more about these genres can help.</p> <p>Examples of books he has enjoyed (he’s now read pretty much everything by these authors):</p> <p><em>Three Day Road</em> by Joseph Boyden</p> <p><em>Killers of the Flower Moon</em> by David Grann</p> <p><em>The Devil in the White City</em> by Erik Larson</p> <p><em>Under the Banner of Heaven</em> by Jon Krakauer</p> <p><em>The Spy and the Traitor</em> by Be

I also love the author Shalom Auslander who has written nonfiction books analyzing his relationship with Orthodox Judaism -- not the same thing, but maybe worth mentioning?</p> <p>I love a spooky creepy mysterious novel -- like I really loved the vibes of The Dangers of Smoking in Bed by Mariana Enriquez and The Vegetarian by Han Kang.</p> <p>There&#39;s something about the dark brutality embedded in some Catholic themes that I am really interested in exploring, because the outgrowths of some of the negative sides of the faith are things that I&#39;m still grappling with today.
