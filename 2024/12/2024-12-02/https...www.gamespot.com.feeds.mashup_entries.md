<p dir="ltr">This week marks the 30th anniversary of PlayStation, and to celebrate, Sony is rolling out some nostalgic PS5 console features and a short retrospective trailer that's all about the feels.--specifically, the feelings generated by the biggest first- and third-party games that have appeared on Sony consoles over the years. There are a lot of themes mentioned here--from justice to fantasy--and the trailer ends with a shot of Bloodborne and the word "persistence".</p><p dir="ltr">The video is mostly focused on newer PlayStation games like Horizon, Marvel's Spider-Man, and Gran Turismo 7, but there are brief snippets of other influential games like Batman: Arkham Knight and Crash Bandicoot. You can see the trailer below, and in case you're curious, the video uses Dreams by The Cranberries as the backing track.</p><div data-embed-type="video" data-ref-id="2300-6465522" data-src="/videos/playstation-30th-anniversary-thank-you-compilation-video/2300-6465522/" data-width="100%" d
