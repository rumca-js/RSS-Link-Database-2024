 Books as fun as this one are few and far between. Every room in a luxury American hotel is booked out for a ludicrously OTT wedding – except for one.

This novel is unexpected and delightful, funny but never cruel, and loving and tender towards all its characters, even the villainous sister-in-law.

<p>An ambitious multi-part project will transform seven miles of seabed into an artistic destination with a cautionary message</p><p>Over the next few years, coastal waters just off of Miami Beach will be transformed by The ReefLine, an ambitious new project that aims to occupy seven miles of seabed within shouting distance of the sands. The ReefLine aims to one day create an enormous, art-studded underwater playland, including a sculpture park, snorkel trail, and artificial reef.</p><p>One of the first pieces of this project, Miami Reef Star — a gigantic 90-foot star that will eventually be visible to landing aircraft descending over the waters — will be on exhibition during Art Basel Miami Beach. Set up in prototype on Miami Beach itself, it will be a part of Star Compass, a series of three large-scale installations curated by Ximena Caminos and Dodie Kazanjian. In addition to Reef Star, Star Compass will also include The Great Elephant Migration, a work consisting of 100 life-size

<p>Debut director Harley Chamandy shows promise with a skilfully constructed portrait of a former music producer searching for simplicity and solace</p><p>Shot when director Harley Chamandy was 22, making him the youngest recipient of the <a href="https://www.wernerherzog.org/en/werner-herzog-stiftung-filmpreis.html">Munich film festival’s Werner Herzog award</a> for “special achievement in innovation, courage and vision”, this short Canadian drama digs into the peaceable Kaspar Hauser rather than the megalomaniac Aguirre end of the Herzog spectrum. Starring Vincent Leclerc as the eponymous former music producer taking refuge in a lakeside house, it has a disarming simplicity and aura of benevolence.</p><p>Allen Sunshine is a man who seems to have successfully decluttered his life. Accompanied by his great dane, Sully, he spends his time recording nature sounds in the surrounding woods and tweaking his electronica music indoors. He is, though, in recovery from trauma; an unannounced

<p>The astonishing real-life tale of how North Korea kidnapped an actor and her film director ex-husband makes for a fascinating graphic history</p><p>This graphic novel, published first in German, is based on a true story, and if you don’t already know that tale (I’m afraid I didn’t), it will astonish you. A successful actor and her movie director ex-husband are kidnapped by an enemy state, so that they might make movies to please a dictator. On paper, this is the stuff of a disaster-ridden major motion picture, dreamed up by some crazed auteur. But it really happened. In 1978, Choi Eun-Hee, a celebrated actor in her native South Korea, was kidnapped by North Korean agents in Hong Kong, and transported to the city of Namp’o, where she was met by Kim Jong-il, the son of the Great Leader, Kim Il-sung, and then head of the country’s propaganda unit and film studios.</p><p>When Choi’s ex-husband, the director Shin Sang-ok, travelled to Hong Kong to try to find her, the same thing happen

<p>Make simple blinis, classic cocktail sausages and moreish parmesan biscuits. Minimal effort, maximum flavour, guaranteed good times</p><p>“I have never thought of myself as the sort of cook who makes his own bits and pieces to serve with drinks,” said Nigel Slater, writing about Christmas in the Observer. “When I do, I realise I should have done so all along. Not just because what I’ve made often tastes better than anything I can buy, but because the effort is much more appreciated.”</p><p>With that in mind, we bring you simple, delicious recipes to please both guests and cooks throughout the festive season. Make Georgia Levy’s mac ’n’ cheese canapés, build Georgina Hayden’s blinis and try not to eat all of Anja Dunk’s triple-chocolate biscotti in one sitting. Then relax with a glass of Jared Brown and Anistatia Miller’s negroni punch. Happy Christmas from OFM!</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/dec/02/the-20-best-easy-christmas-party-recipes-blinis-pate-punch-and-

<p>Do those who run have a higher risk of osteoarthritis? And what should you do if you start to feel pain? We ask an expert</p><p>You know the warning people often give middle-aged joggers: don’t run too much or you’ll end up with bad knees? “It’s very much a myth,” says Richard Blagrove, senior lecturer in physiology at Loughborough University.</p><p>While many believe that running is&nbsp;linked to osteoarthritis (chronic joint pain) in the knees, studies have&nbsp;revealed that recreational and competitive runners have a much lower incidence of developing it compared with those who don’t run. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28504066/">Research from 25 studies</a> (with a&nbsp;total&nbsp;sample size of about 115,000 participants) has shown that running actually appears to be protective against hip and knee osteoarthritis as&nbsp;we age. Exercise causes very slight damage to muscles, tendons, bones and cartilage but also leads them to grow back stronger and healthier.</p>

<p>The president and supporters argue Hunter Biden would never have been charged were it not for his name – and any father might have done the same. But this exercise of power also looks like a validation of Donald Trump</p><p>A loving act of mercy by a father who has already known much sorrow? Or a hypocritical political manoeuvre reminiscent of his great foe? Maybe both can be true.</p><p>Joe Biden’s announcement on Sunday that he had <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/01/joe-biden-pardons-hunter">pardoned his son Hunter</a>, who is facing sentencing in two criminal cases, is likely to have been the product of a Shakespearean struggle between head and heart.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/02/hunter-biden-pardon-joe-biden-comment">Continue reading...</a>
