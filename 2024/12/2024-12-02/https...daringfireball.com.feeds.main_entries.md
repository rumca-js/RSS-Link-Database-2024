<p>Special guest Allen Pike joins the show to talk about the state of generative AI and how Apple Intelligence measures up (so far). Also: some speculation on Apple’s pending acquisition of the ever-difficult-to-pronounce Pixelmator.</p>

<p>Amazon is running a holiday discount on M3 MacBook Airs, but it’s tricky — you need to click around through various color choices and watch the prices and ship dates. My main link on this post goes to the config that looks like their best deal for price-conscious gift buyers: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DLHQGGN5?tag=df-amzn-20">the 13-inch M3 MacBook Air in space gray, with 24 GB RAM and 512 GB of storage for $1,299</a>, a $200 discount from the list price, with delivery in a few days. They’ve also got the same configuration, at the same price, with the same delivery window in silver. Starlight only has “5 remaining in stock” (and that was at 8 just a few minutes ago, so they’ll likely be gone by the time you read this), and midnight is already out of stock.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CX246FNZ?tag=df-amzn-20">13-inch configuration with 16 GB RAM and 512 GB storage is just $1,099</a>, but delivery dates are in early January. They’ve got <a href="http

<p>Ian King, Liana Baker, and Ryan Gould, reporting for Bloomberg:<sup>*</sup></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Intel Corp. Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger was forced out
after the board lost confidence in his plans to turn around the
iconic chipmaker, adding to turmoil at one of the pioneers of the
technology industry.</p>

<p>The clash came to a head last week when Gelsinger met with the
board about the company’s progress on winning back market share
and narrowing the gap with Nvidia Corp., according to people
familiar with the matter. He was given the option to retire or be
removed, and chose to announce the end of his career at Intel,
said the people, who declined to be identified discussing
proceedings that were not made public.</p>

<p>Intel Chief Financial Officer David Zinsner and Michelle Johnston
Holthaus are serving as interim co-CEOs while the board searches
for Gelsinger’s replacement, <a href="https://www.intc.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1719/intel-announces-reti
