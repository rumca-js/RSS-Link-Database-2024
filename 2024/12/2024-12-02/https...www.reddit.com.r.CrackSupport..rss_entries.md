I cant make changes to the game folder as if the game was running but its doesnt even appear in the task manager. Im using qbittorrent and downloaded multiple different torrents of it but all have the same problem. Any help?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/fds2034"> /u/fds2034 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CrackSupport/comments/1h4hxcz/metal_gear_solid_v_tpp_not_opening/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CrackSupport/comments/1h4hxcz/metal_gear_solid_v_tpp_not_opening/">[comments]
