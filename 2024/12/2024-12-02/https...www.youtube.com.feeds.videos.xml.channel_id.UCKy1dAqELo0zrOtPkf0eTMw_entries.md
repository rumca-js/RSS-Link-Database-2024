In today's Daily Fix:
Marvel Rivals' roster keeps on growing, and we now have a first look at Wolverine via a new trailer. The fan-favorite mutant's new design, however, is raising some eyebrows for its lack of iconic mask and overall younger look. But purists shouldn't fret, as his more recognizable outfits will likely be coming in a season pass or other (likely paid) DLC. In other news, The PlayStation 5 just got a console software update which allows you to choose a new start-up animation and menu theme. This is part of Sony's celebration of the PlayStation's 30th anniversary, and now you can wax nostalgic while your modern PS5 boots up to the sound of the PS1's start-up animation. And finally, a trailer has leaked for a cancelled James Bond game, and no this isn't related to the upcoming Project 007 from IO interactive—it's a Lego game!

## Disney! Stop Announcing Star Wars Movies and Make One

Another week, another Star Wars “announcement” that leads to languished sighs all over the internet. Despite Daisy Ridley saying only a few weeks ago that the Rey-focused Star Wars movie was “evolving” and we’d get an update soon, the news came soon after that the next untitled Star Wars film has been yanked from its December 18, 2026, release date.

And yet, it’s not at all surprising. Regardless of anyone’s thoughts on the quality of individual projects, the Disney Star Wars era has been rife with corporate mismanagement, constant second-guessing, and an inability to envision a future for the property beyond pilfering from its past. It’s a sad state of affairs, but it’s also what Lucasfilm has been doing for far too long, to the point that it’s time we stop giving the company any credence unless they go through a serious realignment. Let’s take a look at why we all need to stop paying attention to Star Wars.

The Rey movie, currently set to be directed by Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy, may

Video games have never been more popular, technically impressive, easily accessible to players, but the games industry has certainly seen better days. Skyrocketing budgets of AAA projects and diminishing returns on live-service games have resulted in over 23,000 jobs in the video game industry were lost in the two years. Over 30 video game development studios have ceased operations including Arkane Austin, Volition, and most recently, Firewalk Studios. While games as a service can be extremely lucrative, some projects never see the light of day, like Naughty Dog’s cancelled The Last of Us Online. On the other hand, some games do come out in some form, only to be pulled offline, like SEGA’s Hyenas, which never made it past a public beta, or PlayStation’s massive flop, Concord, which was completely taken offline just two weeks after launch. What’s the solution? There’s no clear answer, but smaller projects could allow for more innovation - after all, look at recent indie hits, like Bal
