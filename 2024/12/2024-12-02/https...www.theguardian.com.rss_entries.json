He is as good as his word. This is the most engaging imagining of the progress of the 20th-century novel you will read. Frank brings serious erudition to the task \u2013 in his day job he is editorial director of New York Review Books and has for 25 years edited its eclectic classics series which breathes new life into half-forgotten or out-of-print treasures. Though he has a fine critical judgment, Frank writes as an enthusiast at least as much as an academic, trusting his taste, always alive to the stories he is telling and the arguments he makes.</p><p>His method is broadly chronological, offering the reader a \u201clong\u201d 20th century, beginning",

The film\u2019s opening sequences are near-wordless, as the camera gazes on the Burmese village of Dahat Pin. Here, the muddy, golden-hued landscape is dotted with countless derricks, simple bamboo structures. A cacophony of cranking levers, roaring generators, and sputtering smoke plumes harmonises into a dynamic soundscape, bringing to life the operations of these hand-operated, independent oil extractors. Unique to Myanmar, these oil-fields are unregulated by the government and often face intimidation from the army.</p><p>Among those living this way are Htwe Tin and Thein Shwe, a married middle-aged couple whose daily travails constitute the film\u2019s beating heart. A former farmer, Thein Shwe now toils over two oil we",
