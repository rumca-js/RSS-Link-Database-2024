Is there a list or does it even exist or is it a thing that some indexers/providers do some things &quot;better&quot; than others or is it just a situation where the indexers index all of it so if I don&#39;t see it with NZBGeek then it isn&#39;t there? So I&#39;m asking is there a better place to go for Manga, Anime, Porn, Books than others; for both sides? &lt;--Meaning both indexer and/or provider.</li> <li>Using NZBGeek and Son

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m just trying to make sure that I have my Provider servers correct. I have 2 providers. Each has an EU server and then a US server. I have my EU servers set with a priority of &quot;0&quot; and have each server with half of the connections for that provider. I then have the US servers with a priority of &quot;1&quot; and half of the server connections. My thought process is to try to not get the max connections error when something is downloading. I think this is the way that I should have it setup but I&#39;m making sure. I&#39;m trying to see which providers actually pull for the next year to see which providers I should keep and which ones need to be changed, etc. Thanks in advance.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/justcam"> /u/justcam </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1h4zg0l/provider_server_settings_in_sab/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https:/
