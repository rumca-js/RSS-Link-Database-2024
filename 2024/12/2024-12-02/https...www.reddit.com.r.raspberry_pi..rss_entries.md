## CM5 PCIe Still Just 1 Lane Available

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Was anybody else hoping the CM5 would make 2-4 lanes of PCIe available? If the RP1 could have been attached with 1-2 lanes instead of 4, it would open up a lot of options for more robust expansion boards. <a href="/u/geerlingguy">u/geerlingguy</a> could really get some absurd projects fired up that way!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/cmrcmk"> /u/cmrcmk </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1h55q1u/cm5_pcie_still_just_1_lane_available/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1h55q1u/cm5_pcie_still_just_1_lane_available/">[comments]</a></span>
