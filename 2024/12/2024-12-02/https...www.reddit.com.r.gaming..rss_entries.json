I was playing Unreal Tournament 3 a lot, but it no longer has any available online multiplayer servers, as Epic dropped online support for that game (as well as Unreal Tournament 2004). Yesterday though, I remembered that the original Unreal Tournament from 1999 still has some active multiplayer servers, so I gave it a try, and what do you know, I was able to connect online with it and found multiple servers, some which were active with other players.</p> <p>The original Unreal Tournament is a fun game, so maybe I&#39;ll play that now for online multiplayer. I&#39;m curious why the online support for later Unreal Tournament games was removed when the original Unreal Tournament still has active online servers?</p> <p>Als",
