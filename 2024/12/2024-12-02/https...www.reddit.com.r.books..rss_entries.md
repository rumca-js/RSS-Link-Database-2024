<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>For years I’ve enjoyed Anthony Burgess’s Malayan trilogy <em>The Long Day Wanes</em>. It was a revelation, showing the complexities of a colonized multiethnic, multiracial, multilingual society facing ‘liberation’ and having to sort out its multiple contradictions and conflicts on its own as a new nation. Burgess skillfully detailed the languages and habits of many of the various groups involved. </p> <p>Recently I was given a copy of George Orwell’s first novel, <em>Burmese Days.</em> Published in 1934, it dealt with English colonials in a kind of Burmese backwater. The works bear obvious similarities and even more obvious differences. In both, the main protagonist is a white Englishman who more or less has fallen in love with the country and feels guilt for colonial transgressions. He’s outnumbered of course by the other white pukka sahibs and there is dark comedy in how he is scorned both by his fellow colonialists and the natives he secretly care

## After I finish reading a book, I always write a review. If I think the book is good or amazing, I give it 5 stars. But if it's bad I usually rate it 4 stars because I don't want to hurt the author's feelings.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>As I don’t want to hurt the author’s feelings, I never rate a book 1 star. Imagine putting in all that effort and time to write a book, only to get a 1 star rating, that must be really disheartening. For books I don&#39;t like or even bad books I give 4 stars and explain in the comments why it received that rating. I think this provides better feedback for the author, as they’ll understand why the book didn’t earn 5 stars. Also, before I read a book I do some research so most of the books I finish, I really enjoy. There are only a few that I don&#39;t like, but as far as I remember I&#39;ve never rated a book 1 star. Also, I don&#39;t think a 5 star rating is always sufficient, a 10 point scale would be better. If that were available, I could rate a book 6 or 7 if I didn&#39;t like it, but never 1 star.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Delicious_Maize9656"> /u/Delicious_Maize9656 </a> <br/> <span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>In a lot of books written by men (if it’s not glaringly obvious), I’m noticing this undercurrent of misogyny in a lot of their books I try to read. I’m currently reading “The Shadow of the Wind” by Carlos Ruiz Zafón, and the way women are described is just gross, makes me roll my eyes, and I honestly don’t feel like I want to pick up the book anymore because of it. I’m enjoying the plot otherwise, but it just gives me this nasty feeling any time a woman’s appearance is described. And this isn’t even <em>close</em> to being the worst example. I often DNF books with male authors because it seems like they just view women as sexual objects and not really deep characters. It makes it harder for me to relate to the story. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/sunlover010"> /u/sunlover010 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h4yb1i/finding_it_difficult_to_read_books_written_by_

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Ta-Nehisi Coates is a crucial writer for this era we find ourselves in now, in this chaotic year of 2024. </p> <p>When so much seems to be going wrong in the world, it’s important to have writers and artists lay out how the world is (and how the world should be), to interpret and express the contradictions and horrors of America, and of the world America has made. </p> <p>For some activists who are very tuned into certain current events, Coates’ book The Message won’t quite say anything new. But that isn’t really the point. It’s not a history book—it’s not meant to be a scholarly review of everything racist within America and in those countries propped up by American support. </p> <p>Rather, The Message is a personal book by a writer who overlays these issues through the filter of his own experiences. And that is where its true value lies. </p> <p>This memoir is made up of three essays, each more powerful than the last. In the first, Coates goes to S

I need to choose three book (series) where main female characters would have different archetypes. In addition, preferably, there should be diversity in my chosen books, so different authors, settings, and character dynamics are important. The first book series that I chose is The Cruel Prince, where Jude is a warrior archetype. Could you give me any advice on which other books I should choose? With main female characters who are different from Jude?
