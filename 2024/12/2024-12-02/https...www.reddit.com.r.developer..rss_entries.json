Honestly, I don&#39;t get why people would choose Windows over Unix based OS for software development, but that&#39;s another discussion.</p> <p>At the beginning I was really concerned having to migrate all my dev workflow to windows since I am a heavy terminal user with Neovim and Tmux, with all my keymaps and the speed this env offers me.</p> <p>I found a possible workaround via WSL to keep using the terminal. I some cases I could even run the projects directly from wsl. But in some others I could not, since they are dotnet projects developed in windows env and when trying to run them on wsl, the filesystem would blow up throwing a number of errors.</p> <p>The whole experience, with WSL and Neovim to edit the code and with Windows to run the projects, feels so clunky and very memory inefficient to me.
