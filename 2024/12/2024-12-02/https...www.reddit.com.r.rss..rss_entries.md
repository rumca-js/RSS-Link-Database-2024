<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I like to follow a ton of forums, usually to get movies, links, images, etc... But I have to go into each forum every time, update to the newest page... It&#39;s a pain in the ass. InoReader can turn some forums into RSS, but often it&#39;s just the same page, it doesn&#39;t get the next one once it&#39;s created. Is there any tool to help? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Tsavkko"> /u/Tsavkko </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1h51w18/rss_for_forums/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1h51w18/rss_for_forums/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Are there any materials on how to start doing this? I subscribe to openrss, so they can make a few for me. But I was thinking about how... making an rss feed from a BSKY search might be cool to learn to do.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/loudpersononthebus"> /u/loudpersononthebus </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1h4zyvf/how_to_get_started_making_my_own_feeds/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1h4zyvf/how_to_get_started_making_my_own_feeds/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m looking for a free RSS feed generator online that allows me to create a feed that updates frequently (once 2 hours approximately would be acceptable) and has a limit over that of 100 items per feed. I don&#39;t want to create multiple feeds, just one, but that one feed needs to hold at least 100 items. Is there any free resource available online?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/IndieDev7"> /u/IndieDev7 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1h4xg1s/free_rss_feed_generators_with_a_minimum_of_100/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1h4xg1s/free_rss_feed_generators_with_a_minimum_of_100/">[comments]</a></span>
