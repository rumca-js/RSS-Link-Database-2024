<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Ender mainboards, and printers like them, are literally just arduinos with power in, and 3-4 stepper motor drivers built in, plus some other pre made input/outputs. You can reprogram them with the Arduino IDE to use them for literally ANYTHING you need. If you are a maker/robotics tinkerer, this shit is hella undervalued just because it&#39;s in the form factor of a &quot;3d printer&quot;. Let&#39;s just look at the BOM. </p> <p>Literally just the parts alone; </p> <p>Nema 17 steppers: $10 x 3 = $30 24v psu: $20 Aluminum extrusions and other hardware: idk $20? Most importantly: Mainboard: $40 </p> <p>Total: $110 </p> <p>If you can find an ender for less than $110 it is a steal for whatever project you can think of that needs motors and an arduino. </p> <p>I have 2 ideas for repurposing old enders and would love to see more ideas showcase the reusability of these machines. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.

Not my model anyway. So I think Bats came out pretty good? Printed on my lightly modded Creality Ender 3 V3 KE bedslinger. Don’t ask me where I got the STL. I didn’t bookmark it and it’s been in my “print challenges” folder for a while. Harshest lighting to show detail. Cheap regular Black PLA. (JAYO) took about 10 hours to print. I like the way the slightly fuzzy skin gives it a rough matte finish. The supports weren’t required, kudos to the model maker, but those spots looked a bit rough without them. The ironed concentric base top kinda looks like water puddles?<
