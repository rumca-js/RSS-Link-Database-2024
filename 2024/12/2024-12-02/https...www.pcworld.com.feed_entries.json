You simply write a descriptive text and then the AI service creates the image you want. No special commands are required, you just type your text in plain language, for example <strong><em>A cat playing chess </em></strong>or <strong><em>A blue wallpaper for Windows 11</em></strong>. If you\u2019re not happy with the result, just add more details.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can then download the image you have created and use it however you like. Copyright only applies to material created by humans, not by machines. One of the pioneers of AI images is the Dall-E service from Open AI.
