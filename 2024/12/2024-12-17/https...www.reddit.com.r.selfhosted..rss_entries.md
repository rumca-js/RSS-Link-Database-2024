Let Proxmox handle the SMART readings and expose shares on a virtual bridge network that services (LXC) on the same physical server bind to? - Running an LXC (Turnkey fileserver or one with Cockpit and plugins) with a bind mount to a zpool on the host? - Creating shares on the host itself.</p> <p>I tried running Truenas Scale bare metal, but found it a waste of resources on a dual scalable CPU server. I also don&#39;t like Docker containers. First one I spun up after a fresh install of Electric Eel gave me a bunch of errors. It&#39;s like CasaOS on top of a NAS, except that with CasaOS at least NPM worked right of the bat. I do like Truenas for what it was designed to do. Being a NAS and being very good at it.
