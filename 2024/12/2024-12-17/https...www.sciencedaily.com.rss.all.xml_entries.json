Decay of uranium to lead within tiny crystals enabled scientists to precisely pinpoint dates for certain events. They determined this event occurred 119.5 million years ago -- coincident with evidence for massive volcanic eruptions -- and lasted for 1.1 million years. Study results help scientists better understand links between atmospheric CO2 levels, climate changes and conditions in the oceans.",
