While I feel confident in my abilities, I don\u2019t yet have professional development experience. Because of this, I\u2019ve been struggling to land an entry-level or junior developer role.</p> <p>I\u2019d love to hear feedback or advice from seasoned developers or anyone currently working in the field. Your feedback and advice are truly priceless to me, and I deeply appreciate any insights you can share.</p> <p>I\u2019m planning to include my resume and a link to my portfolio in this post for reference. Any tips or suggestions on how I can improve them, or general advice about entering the field, would mean a lot to me.</p> <p>Thank you so much for your time and help!</p> <p><a href=\"https://andersonportfolio.pythonanywhere.com/\">Portfolio</a> , <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PCKXsHPvmur7mJHSiufv_Gid5Axo4LAi/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ouid=",
