<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey guys, I guess there are some LiveNation investors here, so this might be useful for you. It’s about the anti-competitive practices revealed after last year&#39;s Taylor Swift tickets scandal. </p> <p>So, a few years ago LiveNation and Ticketmaster merged, with the condition of preserving the competition in the live events market (whatever that means, lol). </p> <p>However, in 2022, after its system crashed during Taylor Swift’s ticket presale, the platform was accused of anti-competitive practices, such as enforcing long contracts and punishing artists and venues that opted out.</p> <p>When this news came out, stock dropped and investors filed a lawsuit against the company for this conduct. The good news is that LiveNation finally decided to settle with investors and pay for the damages. </p> <p>So if you got hit by this, you can check the details and <a href="https://11thestate.com/cases/lyv-investor-lawsuit">file to get payment</a>.</p> <p>Anyw
