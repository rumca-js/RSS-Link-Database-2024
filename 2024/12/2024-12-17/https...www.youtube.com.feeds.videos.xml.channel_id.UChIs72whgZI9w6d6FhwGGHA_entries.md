Hardware news this past week has been slammed: Intel launched its B580 GPU in the Arc 'Battlemage' series, which has been widely received as a successful product launch for the company. Alongside this, Intel has a healthy mix of partner models this time, which we round-up in this video. Those include ASRock, Acer, Gunnir, Sparkle, and others. Additionally, we cover SteamOS branding guidelines appearing for third-party devices in a promising glimpse at a future of more non-Windows devices. Thermal Grizzly launched putty, Arctic launched an interesting passive under-desk PC, trade issues continue for China and the US, and more.
