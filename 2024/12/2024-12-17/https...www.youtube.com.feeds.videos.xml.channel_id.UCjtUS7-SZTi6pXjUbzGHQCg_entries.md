Believe it or not, the long-promised next generation of solar panels are here. A tandem perovskite solar panel with higher efficiency than silicon alone has just arrived on the market. The first batch has already been purchased by an undisclosed U.S. customer, which will soon install them in a 15-20 megawatt plant alongside traditional solar panels. This isn’t just hype: this is happening. Perovskites, whether used in hybrid setups or as fully functional solar cells, have finally materialized thanks to some big breakthroughs at Oxford PV. So how did they pull it off? What’s the catch? And has anyone else cracked the code on perovskite durability issues?
