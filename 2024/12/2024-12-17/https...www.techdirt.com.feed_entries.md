As a non-fan, non-supporter of Donald Trump, I don&#8217;t have much left after discovering a disturbing number of my fellow Americans prefer fascism to liberty. But I still have these things I will forever hold near and dear to my heart: schadenfreude and irony. And, if you&#8217;re like me, you get both of these things [&#8230;]

Katie Couric recently claimed that repealing Section 230 would help combat online misinformation. The problem is, she couldn&#8217;t be more wrong. Worse, as a prominent voice, she&#8217;s contributing to the widespread misinformation around Section 230 herself.

A few years back, Karl Bode wrote about YouTube TV&#8217;s 2020 price hike, going from $50/month for its base package, to $65/month.
