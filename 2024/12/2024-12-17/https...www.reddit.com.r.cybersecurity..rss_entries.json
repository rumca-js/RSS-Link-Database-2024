In a public organisations with over 30k staff and many more thousands of devices, up to 100k. This is especially fustrating for products that are hosted, managed etc. by us, or atleast in part. These kind of licensing models just make it simply impossible to justify the price, not only to management, but myself. Our corefunction, is not IT, but something else entirely. </p> <p>As an example, a product costing a mere 5\u20ac/month/user, would cost us just shy of 2 million euro a year. At that price, you can get for example, a password manager. This then leads to having several different kind of tools or then vendorlocking to for example a particular company starting with M. </p> <p>So, often or almost every single time, we simply, do not buy these products and look elsewhere.
