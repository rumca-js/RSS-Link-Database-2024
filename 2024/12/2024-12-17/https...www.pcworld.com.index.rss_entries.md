<p>Epic Games Store has officially started its annual winter sale — and as in previous years, Epic will also be giving away several PC games for free during this winter sale.</p>



<p>While Epic hasn’t revealed anything about which games are being given away just yet, in total there will be 16 games. And if they’re anything like the games given away before, we’re pretty excited to see what’s in store. In past years, we’ve seen everything from acclaimed indie games to bigger AAA games, like <em>Control</em> and <em>Death Stranding</em>.<br><br>The first game being given away for free is <em>The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria</em>, which has already been marked down <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/the-lord-of-the-rings-return-to-moria-f01344">on the Epic Games Store</a> and will stay that way until 8 AM on December 19.

<p>Outlook has been experiencing problems on Windows 10 and Windows 11 computers for days now, probably starting as early as December 2nd. It’s been reported by affected users across various forums and in Microsoft’s Feedback Hub that when users try to log into Outlook, the app issues error code 0x80049dd3.</p>



<p>Microsoft has acknowledged the issue and claims in the Feedback Hub to have solved the problem. <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/windows-outlook-0x80049dd3-bug-apparently-still-not-fixed-even-though-microsoft-says-it-is/">Neowin</a> quotes one Microsoft developer:</p>

<p>“This should be resolved now. Thanks for taking the time to report this. As always, please don’t hesitate to file a new piece of feedback to let us know if you continue experiencing issues.”</

<p>When buying a PC, it’s not just one single component that counts, like the best graphics card or the most powerful CPU. Instead, you need to consider many individual parts when making your decision.</p>



<p>One important component that plays a role, especially for demanding applications such as gaming or video editing, is the RAM. It serves as a cache for all of your system’s important data, programs, and more, so that it can be accessed more quickly. Working memory is also known as RAM, but why is it there at all?</p>

<p>Are you ready to snag one of the coolest pairs of earbuds you’ve ever seen? Because the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bose-Immersive-Wireless-OpenAudio-Awareness/dp/B0CPFV77W4/">Bose Ultra Open earbuds are just $229 on Amazon right now</a>, a cool 23 percent off their usual price.</p>



<p>These aren’t your typical earbuds. They don’t plug into your ear canals, so they won’t fall out when you bend over to pet your dog or when you go out jogging, and they won’t cause your ear holes to ache. Instead, they clip on by gently wrapping around the ridge of your ear.</p>



<p>Apart from that unique design choice, the Bose Ultra Open earbuds have IPX4 water resistance so they can withstand splashes, sweat, and rain, and they have a solid battery life of up to 7 hours of active playtime on a single charge. Overall, with the (non-wireless) charging case, you can

<p>Believe it or not, AI is already subtly reshaping the PC.</p>



<p>No, we’re not talking about the microprocessor or integrated NPUs. There, progress has been slow and stuttering, as chip vendors and Microsoft work toward establishing an ecosystem of Copilot+ PCs.</p>



<p>Instead, PC vendors are looking for ways to reinvent the familiar with AI capabilities. Within Windows, you’re already seeing this with generative AI and filtering influencing the direction of Photos and Paint. But we wanted to know what PC vendors thought about the future of the AI PCs they’re building. The unexpected answers? Voice. The phone. </p>
