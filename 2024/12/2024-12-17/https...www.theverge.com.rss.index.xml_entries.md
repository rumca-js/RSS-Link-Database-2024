  <p id="hflEAp">Google announced a bunch of new stuff last week, from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/11/24317436/google-deepmind-project-astra-mariner-ai-agent">Gemini 2.0 and Project Mariner</a> to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/12/24319528/google-android-xr-samsung-project-moohan-smart-glasses">Android XR and Project Moohan</a>.

  <p id="IKEVEe">The open social web still isn’t as open as we all might want, but a non-profit is being formed to try and change that. The non-profit, called <a href="https://www.anew.social">A New Social</a>, is being headed up by Ryan Barrett, the founder of Bridgy Fed, and Anuj Ahooja, an engineering leader and writer.</p>
<p id="fahiCz">“We believe that a healthy ecosystem competes on innovative features, not critical mass,” A New Social says <a href="https://www.anew.social/mission/">on its mission page</a>. “The social web should be centered around people, not platforms, and artificial walls should not deny them the relationships they’ve built online.” T
