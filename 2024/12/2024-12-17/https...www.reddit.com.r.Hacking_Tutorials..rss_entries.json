Back with yet another NOOB tutorial. We have all seen spacehuhn\u2019s wifi deauther and other variations. However, this one does not use the ESP8266 or ESP32. It uses a relatively new (or recently popular) microcontroller on the block \u2014 RTL8720DN (BW16) by Ai-Thinker. It features 2.4ghz/5ghz &amp; Bluetooth! </p> <p>Working on adding evil twin, and really seeing how much you can do with these BW16 chips, because I can imagine many ESP32 projects may not be compatible yet. I will release the custom PCB soon, for now you can follow the tutorial, grab the code and set it up yourself! Cost about ~$1",
