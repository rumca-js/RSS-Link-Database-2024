<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I just wondered. FBI&#39;s personal data got leaked years ago and a little piece of it still being shared in forums. I know it is not a real problem for them.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So long story short I had an online test and professor shared an encrypted pdf until we finish with identification of every student. Someone did brute force on that file and had it before the estimated time, how could one achieve this and what you need for that?</p> <p>I knew it could be done but never really researched about it.</p> <p>**EDIT: Do not send me messages about doing that for me, so I can pay you. The test has already be done yesterday and I have submitted my answers!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/InDaVlock"> /u/InDaVlock </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1hg8dzk/how_could_one_brute_force_an_encrypted_pdf/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1hg8dzk/how_could_one_brute_force_an_encrypted_pdf/">[comments]</a></span>

I&#39;m getting ready to begin performing regular bug bounty hunts in order to boost my resume and hopefully earn a couple extra dollars on the side.</p> <p>To begin, I&#39;ve been advised to shoot for &quot;Low hanging fruit&quot; such as SQLi and XXS vulnerabilities. I&#39;m looking for any sort of good place to learn how to execute these attacks or more information on what to go for as a beginner (such as which companies are good for beginners or what scopes).</p> <p>Any help is greatly appreciated and thank you in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Temporary_Concept_29"> /u/Temporary_Concept_29 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1hg0ehl/getting_started_with_bug_bounty_hunting/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1hg0ehl/getting_started_with_bug_bounty_hunting/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’ve done a lot of research back-and-forth, but I wanna make sure I’m clear. I know you can use the alpha with Kali or whatever distro to do the same thing as the pineapple can do my question is can you use the pineapple like a Wi-Fi adapter as well.? the reason I ask is because there’s a Wi-Fi pineapple vii local to me for $75 and I’m going to pick it up. I like the idea of having an easy way to get acclimated with how some of the stuff works to peak my interest, but also I’d like to learn how to do it with air crack and all of that stuff as well. Would I be able to do both of those things with the pineapple?Have the option to have a nice automated webinar face but also be able to do it manually?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/TThomps12"> /u/TThomps12 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1hfyku0/wifi_adapter_pineapple_or_alpha/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a hr
