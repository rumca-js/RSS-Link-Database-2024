In 2001, Justice League launched on Cartoon Network to almost universal acclaim. Building off of Batman and Superman solo animated series and spinning off into Justice League Unlimited, the creatives behind the show lead by Bruce Timm were also creating a blueprint that box-office busting superhero movies and TV universes are still using today. Over a decade before The Avengers officially took over the big screen, Timm and co. set a high bar for superhero team-ups.

But they also had a secret. 

Bruce Timm was a Marvel guy.

This is the Inside Story of DC’s flagship team revamping how superhero stories were told on screen, and doing it with the Marvel playbook.

This Inside Story was written by Charlie Lopresto and Evan Gaustad. Interviews conducted by Mike Avila. The video was produced by Clint Gage and Scott Collura, edited by Justin Donaldson with graphics by Kevin Cappiello.

One evening, Mady –a young student by day, locksmith by night– receives an emergency call from Claire to open a lock. But the door the young woman wants to open isn’t hers, and the bag she runs away with isn’t hers either.
