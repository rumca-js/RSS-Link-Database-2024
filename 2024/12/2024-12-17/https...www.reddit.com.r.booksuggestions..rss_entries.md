<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi! I’m looking to gift my brother a great read for Christmas. He’s never been the biggest reader but has recently gotten into books like the Hunger Games and the Maze Runner series. He’s also a big fan of the Lord of the Rings movies and world, but I think he finds the prose in the books a bit dry/complicated. He really likes learning all about different worlds and characters, and discussing the underlying philosophy/social commentary. Unfortunately I know little about adventure and fantasy books, so would love some recommendations for similar books or series! </p> <p>Thanks in advance! :) </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/fia_pia99"> /u/fia_pia99 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1hgk2qj/gift_ideas_similar_to_hunger_games_maze_runner/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1hgk2qj/gift_ideas_similar_to_h

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Psych student headed to be a therapist, musician, intelligent, deep thinker, enjoys complex thought. Nothing toooo big for times sake, but something gripping that’ll keep him turning the pages. He doesn’t care for sci-fi, westerns, action, or gore/horror. Loves people and the human condition, and what makes them tick. His favorite author is Tolstoy. I got him all of Carl Jung’s books a few years ago, which he loved. Favorite book of all time is Flowers for Algernon. I’m thinking of an enjoyable read for a grad student who needs a brain break and hasn’t read for pleasure for a long while, but asked for a book for Christmas! I imagine his preferred genre would be literary fiction, though he does enjoy biographies, and just about anything that he takes the time to read. If I can give any other helpful details, please let me know. Thank you! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Overall-Ad4596"> /u/Overal

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone,</p> <p>I’m a 22-year-old woman who’s always been self-aware, but I’ve let myself go the past two years—physically, mentally, and emotionally. I’ve gained weight, lost my sense of discipline, and I don’t feel like the person I want to be. The truth is, I know what I need to do. I know the steps. I know the habits. I just don’t do them.</p> <p>What I need right now isn’t a soft push or sugar-coated advice—I need hard words, brutal honesty, and real discipline. I need a book that slaps me in the face and reminds me what it means to show up for myself every single day, no excuses. Something that cuts through my BS, calls me out on my laziness, and forces me to take ownership of my life.</p> <p>I’ve already read: • Atomic Habits – great for small habit changes but too gentle for where I am now. • The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*** – good for mindset but not tough enough. • Can’t Hurt Me – my favorite so far because Goggins doesn’t hold back
