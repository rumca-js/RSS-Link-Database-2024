<p>If you’re like me, you probably find your laptop ports to be inadequate. They fill up fast, which is why you need a good docking station that will turn one port into many, expanding your connectivity options.</p>



<p>Plugable is one of our favorite brands for docks, and this <a href="https://shrsl.com/4sdkh">Plugable Thunderbolt 4 dock is down to $139.95 at Plugable.com</a>, a solid 39 percent off its original $229.95 MSRP. While the listing still shows full price, you get the discount once it’s added to your cart.</p>



<p>This super-useful USB4 docking station (model TBT4-UDX1) delivers an 11-in-1 experience, allowing you to fast-charge your laptop while also connecting two 4K@60Hz monitors for a true multitasking setup. Alternatively, you can connect one 8K@30Hz monitor via Thunderbolt 4 port (if you even have such a beast of a monitor).</p>

<p>Every year since 1955, the North American Air Defense Command (NORAD) simulates the path of Santa Claus as he leaves the North Pole and delivers gifts to children around the world.</p>
