But I think we move to the point where we would diversify the play with new leaders / units, etc. But as I understand in order to get even new Leaders + Bases we need to go booster packs route with randomness of their content. I was thinking - if I buy one display: will it guarantee that we can create two decks from display content? I understand that each booster has a base / leader - question is - if it could be that ALL boosters in display will be the same? I didn&#39;t play TCG much, so not sure how it works exactly.

Looking at niche 3D printing youtube videos, they get thousands of views. Looking at terrain making, it also, surprisingly, gets LOTS of views, but when looking at boardgames, once you remove Dice Tower, SU&amp;SD, and maybe like 3-4 channels, that is pretty much it. Everyone else is sitting at such low viewer count. Yesterday I watched a video about this board game and the girl had a serious production behind her! She had 5 of her friends there, she had cameras from different angles showing all the people playing, she had microphones on every person, great sound quality, a lot of b-roll material, nice colours and vibes, and it barely passed 1000 views. </p> <p>So what is with this hobby that is so popular &quot;to join&quot; but not so popular &quot;to watch&quot;</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/AlexRescueDotCom\"> /u/AlexRes",

It\u2019s a game I\u2019ve wanted for a very long time but just can\u2019t justify the money for it. I have a both an FSM and SLA 3D printer and the wife has a nice cricket and printer so I figure I could just make my own version so that I may FINALLY be able to own a copy even if it\u2019s just for me and my group to play. I\u2019ve played it before and was instantly hooked but had to take a big gulp of sadness when I saw the secondary market prices. So my question is that if anyone has a complete copy of the jumbo edition if they could DM me with a full component breakdown? Looking at the rules for it I can see there are 141 money cards but it doesn\u2019t say what the breakdown of those are ie how many of each denomination and so forth. Same with the container cards and what not. Any help would be incredible. Also has anyone ever made their own version of this game or o",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hello, I recently bought a used copy of netrunner 2012 by FFG. I was assured by the seller the copy is complete but I noticed that not all the cards of the core base set had 3 copies of each card? </p> <p>Some card only had a single or two copies. I heard this is normal and was wondering what&#39;s the total card count? Because for e.g. for Jinteki, the manual says I&#39;m supposed to have 28 cards but I counted 33 roughly? So is the 28 referring to 28 unique cards and was I supposed to have 28*3 Jinteki cards in the core set? Thank you.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Xazhariel\"> /u/Xazhariel </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1hfz1be/netrunner_2012/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1hfz1be/netrunner_2012/\">[comments]</a></span>",
