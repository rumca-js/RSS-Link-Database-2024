<p>This heartfelt prequel to the 1994 classic recounts the dramatic backstory of King Mufasa but is scarred by a forgettable musical score</p><p>How did Scar, the wicked uncle from The Lion King voiced by Jeremy Irons, get to be so … well … wicked? How is it that he was only ever known by that cruel and callous nickname, while everyone else got noble-sounding multisyllabic names ending in vowels? Was he once nice, even misunderstood? And, in providing the answers, will the prequel give a clear rebuke to the now rather discredited facial-scarring-equals-evil equation? Well, the answers will show that this movie musical, like the original, is still a rather old-fashioned Kiplingesque creation at heart.</p><p>It is certainly Scar who has the important character arc and narrative journey here, so it should perhaps be his name in the title. Mufasa, originally voiced by the legendary James Earl Jones, here turns out to be a thoroughly and unsurprisingly decent character from the outset. Th

<p>From reigning champions Chelsea in first to newcomers Crystal Palace in 12th, we run the rule over the top flight</p><p>Marking unbeaten Chelsea down a point may seem harsh and a kneejerk reaction to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/dec/14/leicester-chelsea-wsl-match-report">the 1-1 draw against Leicester</a> that rounded off their WSL schedule for 2024. Sonia Bompastor’s side were poor in that game, accruing 81 touches in the opposition box but mustering one goal. However, had they won, a 10 out of 10 score would not have been a given. Why? Bompastor’s side have thrilled this season, sweeping teams aside, and the results have been consistent, but the performances less so. They have conceded goals to Arsenal, Tottenham, Brighton and Leicester but, even when they have kept a clean sheet, there have been signs of a defensive fragility that, on different days, or against different opponents, could be punished. It may seem like scraping the barrel to find faults in a

A moving portrait of a gay actor, Dave Win, of Anglo-Burmese origin. A state-of-the-nation novel about the transition from the liberated 60s to the period of Brexit and Covid. A study of a changing landscape in which a market town’s identity is forever altered by pizza parlours and supermarkets. But less noticed has been Hollinghurst’s forensically accurate picture of British theatre over the last 60 years. The author’s own involvement in theatre has been mainly as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/sep/21/alan-hollinghurst-translating-racine-berenice">a translator of Racine</a> but he shows an acute understanding of an actor’s psyche and the artform

<p>The global calendar remains a mess and rugby’s power-brokers need to get a grip after a controversial weekend</p><p>It is still in there somewhere. The kernel of a great competition, albeit visible only in fleeting glimpses. The shimmering class of Toulouse’s Antoine Dupont, a gripping win for Northampton in Pretoria, the celebrations at the final whistle in Italy after Benetton had downed the English league leaders Bath, the “superman” try by La Rochelle’s Jack Nowell. Stick it all together and an Investec Champions Cup “best of” highlights reel remains a hugely attractive proposition.</p><p>If only that was the sole prerequisite. Because a glance beneath the bonnet of what should be the Rolls Royce of club rugby tournaments reveals an increasing number of misfiring parts, not all triggered by the expansion of Europe to accommodate South Africa’s leading sides. Fail to fix them as a matter of urgency and a once fantastic tournament will end up as little more than a wistful memory

Then, in 2020, he unleashed this masterpiece. Peculiar, poetic and largely preoccupied with the purpose of art, its 10 tracks seemed not just original songs but strikingly original thoughts. The record’s lead single was Murder Most Foul, which rolled in at 16 minutes and 54 seconds, enlisted Fiona Apple and Blake Mills, and considered the assassination of JFK in the broader setting of US political and cultural history. It was audacious and wonderful.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/dec/17/must-listen-late-albums-bob-dylan-aretha-franklin-bruce-springsteen">Continue r

<p>A boy raised underwater by dolphins goes in search of his human mother on dry land in Mohammad Kheirandish’s incoherent fable</p><p>‘Can I keep it, mommy?” It’s likely that even very small kids will smell something fishy about this family adventure from Iranian animator Mohammad Kheirandish. Like The Jungle Book at sea, this is the tale of a human baby rescued from drowning by a dolphin called Snowball and raised as one of the family. To try to explain the preposterousness of keeping a baby alive in the ocean, the dolphins are shown swimming him up to the surface for air every now and then. And to be honest, by the end of the movie, a human breathing underwater is the least of the narrative incoherences.</p><p>The baby, who fell into the ocean after the plane he was travelling in crash landed, grows up believing he is a dolphin. In fairness to him, there is a high degree of sameyness in the animation of the creatures: fish, dolphin, human, all have the same pop-eyed expression. Th

However, this does not mean that Moscow is about to withdraw from the region.

<p>Familiar worries about how to raise a neurodiverse child are played out with empathy but little subtlety</p><p>While normally I’m a soft touch for any film about autistic children, one just can’t let something as sappy and annoyingly didactic as this road movie get by without some honest assessment. It’s obvious the film-makers mean well and no doubt the work comes from a place of love and probably personal experience, but that doesn’t negate how profoundly irritating the main adult character is, as well as the conflict-hugs-closure structure, and the hammy acting from a cast that could do better.</p><p>The annoying adult in the room is Max (Bobby Cannavale), a New Jersey wise guy who is trying to make it as a standup comedian. Max’s idea of being brutally honest on stage is to do material about his adolescent son Ezra’s autism. That would be fine if it were actually daring, honest or actually funny, but instead it’s jokes about how Ezra (played by William A Fitzgerald) wouldn’t t

<p>A chocolate stallion-head Patronus anyone? Gryffindor scarf knitted out of icing? Or popcorn and mousse-filled snitches? These contestants’ culinary feats are utter wizardry</p><p>It is funny the things that stay with you, isn’t it? For instance, if I ever need to create an escape valve for rising feelings that risk bursting out, I allow myself a two-minute rage about the Bread Lion. That was the magnificent creation by Paul Jagger in the 2015 Bake Off’s bread week – yes, nine years ago, what’s your point? – sculpted out of three kinds of dough and which emerged from the oven an Aslanesque beauty, wise, benevolent but with just a hint of danger and Paul Hollywood called “one of the best things I’ve seen in bread, ever”. And yet, Jagger did not get star baker nor even a Hollywood handshake for his efforts. I have known no real peace since.</p><p>So it is possible that I approach Harry Potter: Wizards of Baking not entirely in the lighthearted spirit in which it was intended. Becaus

<p>For the past 10 years cosmologists have been left scratching their heads over why two methods for measuring the universe’s rate of expansion provide totally different results. There are two possible solutions to the puzzle, known as the Hubble tension: either something is wrong with the measurements or something is wrong with our model of the universe. It was hoped that observations from the James Webb space telescope might shed some light on the problem, but instead results published last week have continued to muddy the waters. To understand why the expansion rate of the universe remains a mystery, and what might be needed to finally pin it down, Madeleine Finlay speaks to Catherine Heymans, the astronomer royal for Scotland and a professor of astrophysics at the University of Edinburgh</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/nov/02/hubble-constant-mystery-that-keeps-getting-bigger-estimate-rate-expansion-universe-cosmology-cepheid">The Hubble constant: a

<p>Restoring age-old land rights has enabled 300 villagers to build a profitable business and halt the exodus to the city</p><p>It’s late morning and the sound of axes clacking against wood echoes through Pachgaon’s bamboo forest in the central Indian state of Maharashtra. A huge depot, larger than a cricket stadium,<strong> </strong>is full of bamboo branches, stacked neatly by size in different sections. Nearby is a small, windowless office painted in the colours of the forest – a record-keeper of Pachgaon’s turnaround from abject poverty to relative wealth in just over a decade.</p><p>Pachgaon’s rags-to-riches story follows the implementation of two longstanding Indian laws that restored to the local <em>adivasi</em><em> (</em>tribal) community its traditional ownership rights over the forest, which they lost to rulers and colonisers several generations ago.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/dec/17/india-adivasi-tribal-village-pachgaon-forest-law-tra
