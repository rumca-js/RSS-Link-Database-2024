<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I’ve seen a decent amount of animes and my girl is really into it but I have a hard time getting into it because I want to see more mature/dark elements that aren’t seen too often in animes. It seems like even good shows will eventually have fan service that change the tone or just plain boring filler backstories about every single character in the plot. My favorite animes are: Deathnote, which isn’t a total masterpiece Codegeass starts off great but quickly becomes cliche imo. Perfect Blue, a film I do deem as a masterpiece. Promised Neverland starts off pretty cool. Attack on titan, but totally overrated and prolonged. People tried getting me into Psychopass but I’m not that into sci-fi as much, unless its utterly creepy. So yea horror animes, mystery, thrillers, mind games, mind strategy, MATURE themes, war/politics, wether it’s a show or film, would love to find some more. BONUS POINTS if the characters aren’t highschoolers. </p> </div><!-- SC

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>With the vast array of shows set in the virtual world, it was inevitable for Gundam to dip its toes into the digital world. The results speak for themselves, another kid show made to sell model kits, a show with a unique idea of the virtual world, and a show that&#39;s disliked by the majority of the Gundam fanbase for merely existing. I honestly don&#39;t really share the same amount of malice towards this show as it doesn&#39;t really have anything that bugs the hell out of me personally. I think I tolerate this show a lot more than everyone else due to the mere fact that it&#39;s actually trying to be different. There&#39;s stuff I like, minor flaws that don&#39;t bug me one bit, and just stuff I genuinely prefer over the other shows. While I doubt I&#39;ll convince anyone that this show is not as bad as they make it out to be, this is more for me as I look back at why I tolerate this more than the last 2 shows.</p> <ul> <li>Plot: <ul> <li>With Gu

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Overlord intrigued me, I&#39;ve never been into anime, actually I have an innate hatred for it. Which is why I was impressed that an anime as infuriatingly befitting of every reason why I&#39;d hate an anime was actually able to draw me in. So I want another. After watching all of it&#39;s contents I&#39;m addicted. Though to be honest it&#39;s because of the whole 2B2T-like history it teased in the beginning. Long ago a league of no-life players created an empire through years of tomfoolery and grinding but then they all eventually stopped playing. One day, one of them comes back one last time to reminisce about this empire&#39;s glory days and all of the things he&#39;s done in the game with his friends before the serves for the game close. Only to be trapped inside the game. At least, it&#39;s not so bad being the Overlord.</p> <p>It&#39;s just interesting I keep feeling like I wanna know what else have they done I this game?
