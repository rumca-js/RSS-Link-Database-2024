Founded in 1968, they've been making fantastic audio kit including amps, record decks and headphones for such a long time, and as such, are a brand I've admired from afar. Their P100s are their first run at wireless, over-ear headphones with noise cancelling, which is as competitive of a market as it gets for audio.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-cambridge-audio-melomania-p100-review-a-genuine-disruptor">Read more</a></p>

<img src="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/animal-crossing-pocket-camp-complete-art.jpg?width=1920&height=1920&fit=bounds&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp" /> <p>The last time I wrote for Eurogamer, it was to tell the story of how Nintendo announced the end of Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp as a freemium live service game and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-totally-reasonable-reaction-to-nintendos-email-about-the-end-of-animal-crossing-pocket-camp">sent me into a tailspin of despair</a>. The only thing helping me through this bleak time was the fact that, tucked at the very end of Nintendo's email, was the revelation that my save data could live on in a paid app - Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp Complete - which would arrive in "the future".</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/animal-crossing-pocket-camp-complete-review">Read more</a></p>

<img src="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/HORIZON-SITE_88fwZyZ.png?width=1920&height=1920&fit=bounds&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp" /> <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-forbidden-west">Horizon Forbidden West</a> has received a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> patch and the game represents one of the best-looking and most interesting efforts we've seen on the new console. After all, developers Guerrilla Games are famous for their use of checkerboard rendering on PS4 and PS5, and they've now moved onto something new - but it's <em>not</em> PSSR, the upscaler introduced on PS5 Pro that has been used in so many other PS5 Pro enhanced games. Instead, it's its own solution - a kind of 'Guerilla Super Resolution', if you will, and it represents some of the cleanest reconstructed image quality we've seen on consoles. Just how good is it? We decided to find out.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digi
