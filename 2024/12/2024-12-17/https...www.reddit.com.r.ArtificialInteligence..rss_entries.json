There are AI models, that act like LLMs, but when you ask them for images, they generate one (they are called transformers iirc). So, why it is (or isn&#39;t) possible to create separate modules, for example, for math expression evaluations, or encryption/decryption, etc. For example, I have the following base64 encrypted string: <code>V2hhdCBkaWQgeW91IGV4cGVjdCB0byBzZWUgaGVyZT8K</code>. I say to AI something like <code>Can you please decrypt that base64 encoded string? &lt;string&gt;</code>, and it goes to separate module, which performs decryption, and returns decrypted string.
