## Questions I have regarding Capcom big western push in the 2000's.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I know by the mid 2000&#39;s Capcom&#39;s games were not selling as well in their home country as opposed to overseas. From what I understand, they began to gradually make more games in house that appealed more to the west with games like Shadow of Rome and Dead Rising. Though later (around 2009) they really pushed hard with it and outsourced more of their projects to western developers. Though I recall by that time there was at least one executive who noted that this push was not going as well as they hoped and would only get worse. Yet Capcom continued with said push for a few more years before realizing what a dumb idea it was and just stopped.</p> <p>Is this accurate? If not, more details and clarification would be appreciated.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Odd_Radio9225"> /u/Odd_Radio9225 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1hgkn5o/questions_i_have_regarding_

Everything you need to know about doing all the different types of repairs is in an in-game manual that rivals the in-game manual from &quot;Tunic&quot;</p> <p>Sometimes you get a job where you have to repair a broken AI module on a ship and at first, I hated doing those jobs.
