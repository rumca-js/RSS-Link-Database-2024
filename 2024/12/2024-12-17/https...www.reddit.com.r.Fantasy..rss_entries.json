Now I finish this novel knowing GGK&#39;s not only one of the best prose writers around, not only a great character writer: Ammar, Jehane, Rodrigo, Alvar and all the multifaceted dynamics between them especially the first three, not only a great story teller considering the layered poetry the story told has revealed itself to be: from the title of the book down to the poems within it but also perhaps the most impressive thing to me is how excellently he uses fake-outs. I never thought I&#39;ll come to not only not mind fake-outs after how much a lot of media have bastardised it throughout my life so far but will also grow to appreciate it and actively seek it out until the mast",

I had no idea that I could be so drawn into a completely different world. The world building was just the right balance\u2014not too complicated for a beginner like me, but still intriguing enough to immerse me in it. I really liked how the politics were intertwined with the fantasy elements without being overwhelming. It was just fun to imagine a whole new world. I\u2019ve also always been kind of picky about romance in books. I used to think it was all too predictable or just too pointless, but the subtle, slow burn enemies to lovers dynamic in The Cruel Prince really worked for me. It wasn\u2019t over the top, and that\u2019s exactly what I wanted. My friend tho didn\u2019t like it because she felt there wasn\u2019t enough romance an",

Dying girl goes into a book she loves but barely remembers to save her life. What she doesn&#39;t realise is how much she changes it just by existing. Fantastic concept, clever trope examination and great, layered characters.</p> <p>What I didnt: The ambigious ending? Is it great or is it awful? But even that&#39;s a stretch. I loved the realisation as well.</p> <p>Overall: I read this in about 24 hours.

A lot of the stuff in there is romance(which I don&#39;t like) video game inspired fantasy(which I am also not that into) or just kind of bad. Finding books on there is hard for me, because the algorithm keeps recommending me stuff that is popular but that I am just not interested in. However, since I already have a Kindle I would actually like to use it. I recently started reading The Bound and the Broken series by Ryan Cahill after it was recommended for me and have really been enjoying it. I am essentially looking for something similar to that. I like darker fantasy with flawed characters and don&#39;t mind if it gets depressing or brutal.

But I feel like some people are really missing out on things if they didn&#39;t read them when they were the &quot;appropriate&quot; age.</p> <p>I&#39;m curious how you feel about this. Are you less likely to read something if it&#39;s marketed towards children or teenagers? What makes something a classic you return to as an adult, or, conversely, something you&#39;re happy to leave in the kid&#39;s section? On the other hand, is there anything you read as a young&#39;un that was really inappropriate but you got away with it because it had a dragon on the cover? </p> <p>I&#39;d also love to hear some recommendations of recently published books mark",
