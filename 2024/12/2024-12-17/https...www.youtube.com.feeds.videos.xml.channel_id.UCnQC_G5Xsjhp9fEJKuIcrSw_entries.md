Ben discusses how the Canadian government is on the brink. Canadian parliament is split between parties to vote for a motion of no confidence in order to bring down the government. Similar events are also happening in Germany, where they are heading towards an early election after the embattled German chancellor lost a confidence vote, and Friedrich Merz is most likely to take over. Ben also talks about the world reshaping itself because President Trump is coming into office. Western countries are moving away from left-wing policies, and the NATO chief is encouraging more aid to Ukraine from other European countries. In Trump‚Äôs most recent press conference, he talked about the new energy and hope that‚Äôs broken out across the country, calling it ‚ÄòThe Golden Age Of America.‚Äô

The political and cultural elite are too online. Ben discusses Bernie Sanders and Chris Murphy ‚Äúpulling an Elizabeth Warren‚Äù in the media by suggesting shooting someone in the back is irresponsible, BUT it does raise a long-standing concern about the profit-driven healthcare system. Ben also talks about Caitlin Clark‚Äôs recent interview, in which she acknowledges her white privilege and wishes to use her voice on behalf of all the black WNBA stars. In response to this, the co-owner of the Washington Mystics rips into Caitlin and her fans, saying they only like her because she is white.
