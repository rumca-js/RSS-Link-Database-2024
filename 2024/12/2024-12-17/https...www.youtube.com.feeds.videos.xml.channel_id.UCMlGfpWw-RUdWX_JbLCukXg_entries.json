Are you familiar with Small String Optimization? Brace yourself for uncovering yet another ingenious strategy that might surprise you.\n\nEverybody, including me, tells you how great `constexpr` is, but do you truly believe its potential? Embark on a journey with me as we delve into a compelling example demonstrating the transformative impact of constexpr, which enhances runtime performance while reducing memory overhead.\n\nFurthermore, I'll unveil C++ Insights' capabilities and demonstrate how it can assist your approach to designing class data member layouts, ultimately optimizing the size of your data types.\n\nAre you leveraging uniform initialization fo",
