<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I keep hearing about how 20%, 30%, or even 50% of jobs will be replaced by AI, as a small number of people could perform those jobs more efficiently. Could this result in violent revolution and resistance? I used AI to auto-correct grammatical mistakes in this post, as my English isn&#39;t very good, and I couldn&#39;t have imagined this being possible 10 years ago.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Honestly no idea if this is a good place to ask this question, but lately I have seen a bunch of people talking pretty strangely and it all seems related to the blog LessWrong and other groups with similar thought processes. They all seem to be attempting to become perfectly rational in all aspects of their lives. This movement also seems related to effective altruism, though I mostly see it pop up in relation to AI and AGI. Other than AI related opinions, I have seen a lot of general reproduction of theories and ideas in other fields just using different jargon, and oddly enough race science. It all seems rather contrived, but I have seen people making assertions that this movement is really big in tech circles and that some of the most influential people in the world are involved or influenced by it directly.
