<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This one caught me off guard. I have a Lenovo 8 inch tablet and the screen broke a bit... (Still works but more and more is obscured each day) So I got another one just like it to migrate to... Hahaha! I have done my best to minimize Google, so making a complete backup of everything and sending it to them just so I can get it back is NOT on the agenda! And the few transfer programs I have seen are vendor specific, and Lenovo is not one of the vendors. :)</p> <p>Most of the stuff I can manually transfer, but that will be a pain. And my browser history I can not transfer unless I cloud my browser as well... I mean, why is this even a problem? We fixed it on PC decades ago! Any ideas?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/HoustonBOFH"> /u/HoustonBOFH </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/degoogle/comments/1hg1bcg/moving_an_android_tablet_without_google/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=
