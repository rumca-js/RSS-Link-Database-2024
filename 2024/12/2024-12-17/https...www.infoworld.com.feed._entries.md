<p>Google has launched new Gemini Code Assist tools that are designed to help developers improve their productivity from within an integrated development environment (IDE), such as Visual Studio Code or JetBrains.</p>



<p>“These tools are all about developer productivity by enabling them to stay in their coding interface (IDE) of choice while accessing related information from other applications or tools,” said Kathy Lange, research director at IDC.</p>



<p>Expanding further, Moor Strategy and Insights principal analyst, Jason Andersen, said that the launch of these tools is in sync with the industry trend of evolution of IDEs in general.</p>

<p>At AWS re:Invent 2024, Amazon Web Services addressed a critical concern for enterprises using modern cloud technology: managing the growing complexity of cloud environments at scale. Enterprises are confronted by the challenges of evolving systems, managing large-scale architectures, and optimizing operations. Cloud complexity is now a key obstacle to innovation and efficiency.</p>



<p>As defined by AWS, the complexity problem lies in the operational chaos often created by interconnected systems, unpredictable workloads, and the sheer scale of cloud deployments. To tackle this challenge, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/aim5x73crbM">AWS CTO Werner Vogels introduced</a> the concept of “si

<p>Since ChatGPT arrived in late 2022, <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3709489/large-language-models-the-foundations-of-generative-ai.html">large language models</a> (LLMs) have continued to raise the bar for what <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3689973/what-is-generative-ai-artificial-intelligence-that-creates.html">generative AI</a> systems can accomplish. For example, GPT-3.5, which powered ChatGPT, had an accuracy of 85.5% on common sense reasoning data sets, while GPT-4 in 2023 achieved around 95% accuracy on the same data sets. While GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 primarily focused on text processing, GPT-4o — released in May of 2024 — is multi-modal, allowing it to handle text, ima
