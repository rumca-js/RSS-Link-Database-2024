<p>Apple has been accused of knowingly financing a trade characterized by atrocities in criminal litigation launched by the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). It relates to use of so-called “blood minerals” in its devices.</p>



<p>While Apple will be the first tech firm to be targeted, it is unlikely to be the last, given that every digital device makes use of these materials.</p>



<p>The accusations reflect an unfortunate truth: that to some extent, the digital world and the devices used to drive it are built on slavery and other forms of human misery.</p>



<p>That’s the take-home message at the heart of the litigation. It claims Apple’s supply chain is contaminated by “blood minerals” (al

<p>You can do a lot more with generative AI (genAI) in Google Sheets than get help writing spreadsheet formulas. Thanks to extensions such as Claude for Sheets, you can also do things like:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Determine whether text sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral</li>



<li>Classify text into categories</li>



<li>Extract email addresses, phone numbers, and other entities from plain text</li>

<p>And you can do this without having to write computer code in a language like Python.</p>



<p>Instead, you only need spreadsheet formulas as simple as:</p>
