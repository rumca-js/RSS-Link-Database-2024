But today after it shows the error the app is unable to open. When I don&#39;t have anadius on I can open the EA app. Feel free to ask for more info. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Key_Feedback_4694"> /u/Key_Feedback_4694 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CrackSupport/comments/1hfyajb/sims_4_anadius_ea_app_not_launching/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CrackSupport/comments/1hfyajb/sims_4_anadius_ea_app_not_launching/">[comments]</a></span>
