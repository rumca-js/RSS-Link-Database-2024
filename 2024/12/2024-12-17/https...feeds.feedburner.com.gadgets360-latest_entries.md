NASA’s retired InSight Mars lander has been spotted by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) in a recent image taken on October 23, 2024. The image, captured using the HiRISE camera, shows dust accumulation on InSight’s solar panels, now matching the reddish-brown Martian surface. This observation provides insights into wind patterns and dust movement on Mars, aiding researchers in understanding its environmental changes. InSight’s mission ended in December 2022 after excessive dust on its panels disrupted communications. MRO continues to monitor changes on Mars, including both active and retired missions, offering long-term insights into the planet’s surface dynamics.

Permafrost, a frozen layer rich in organic matter, is degrading due to rising temperatures. By the end of the century, researchers predict significant thawing, releasing carbon into the atmosphere. In a study by Zhengzhou University and Purdue University, thawing scenarios under two climate pathways (SSP126 and SSP585) project the release of up to 252 gigatons of carbon. The study also explores the potential ecosystem impacts, including changes in plant growth and carbon storage. Mitigation of human-induced emissions is crucial to stabilising permafrost and the climate.

The Ursid Meteor Shower of 2024 will peak overnight from December 21 to 22, offering one last chance to catch a meteor display this year. The event, active from December 17 to 26, is expected to produce around 10 meteors per hour, with the best viewing conditions occurring before dawn on December 22. The shower's radiant point lies in the Ursa Minor constellation, or the Little Dipper, which will be visible all night in the Northern Hemisphere. Despite a waning gibbous moon, which may outshine some meteors, stargazers can still enjoy the show by watching around midnight when the moon is lower in the sky. For optimal viewing, finding a location away from artificial light is key.
