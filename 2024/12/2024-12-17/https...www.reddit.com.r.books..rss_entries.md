<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>What a great book, I just finished it. I have to say, I think the end is as much about Cal’s redemption as it is about Adam’s forgiveness to his brother, what with Cal being Charles’ son. </p> <p>There will always be Cains and Abels. Adam was an Abel forgiving a Cain in that moment. Really nice story. Lee was my favorite.</p> <p>Just wanted to share my thoughts.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/AdventurousCandle203"> /u/AdventurousCandle203 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hgh7zs/spoilers_the_ending_of_east_of_eden/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hgh7zs/spoilers_the_ending_of_east_of_eden/">[comments]</a></span>

## Storing books in insulated attic?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi. I&#39;m moving to a house with a completely insulated attic that could technically be turned into a bedroom (to give you an idea of how secure it is). It doesn&#39;t have its own heater but is dry and the warmth from the house will go up, of course. Would that be safe to put bookshelves in? I have shorter ones that I could put there, and there&#39;s no denying that I&#39;m gonna need space (the living room doesn&#39;t have enough wall real estate lmao). But I don&#39;t want my books to get damaged, obviously.</p> <p>I appreciate all input. Thanks in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/shiftinganathema"> /u/shiftinganathema </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hgdhiz/storing_books_in_insulated_attic/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hgdhiz/storing_books_in_insulated_attic/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>If you have read the book of the No. 1 Ladies&#39; Detective Agency, #8 - The Good Husband of Zebra Drive, maybe you can help me with something. Spoilers if you haven&#39;t and are planning to.</p> <p>How did the discussion between Mr JLB Matekoni and Mma Ramotswe conclude after he asked her if she would ever leave him? This is after he had developed the photo. He eventually asked her this while they were eating at the table. </p> <p>The library audiobook copy I have borrowed has an issue and skipped from that part to the bit about Mma Ramotswe thinking about the case with the hospital deaths in the same bed, specifically she is thinking that a good explanation has already been provided. Any information for what happened in between? Thank you.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/parallel_universes"> /u/parallel_universes </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hg9z3a/no_1_l

## Just read Matterhorn. What a great mix of aspects of a war novel

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This gripping book takes the reader to war with a young marine officer on his first combat tour. </p> <p>I&#39;ve read that the writing process took decades after Marlantes went to Vietnam. I believe it. The book introduces you to boredom and blood, body horror (leeches and rot) racial tension, beauracratic indifference and incompetence, theft and corruption, loyalty and courage, survivors guilt and more. </p> <p>The writing ranges from brutal and direct to philosophical and empathetic. If you have ever wanted to recommend catch 22 to someone but want a more straightforward story, Matterhorn would be a good choice. </p> <p>It&#39;s a well crafted story about flawed humans caught in complex structures, doing violence. I will probably revisit it, but not soon. </p> <p>If any of you have read it, what are your thoughts? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/boxer_dogs_dance"> /u/boxer_dogs_dance </a> <br

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I cant believe it took me this long.</p> <p>I dove right in without prior expectations, just a friend&#39;s book suggestion. Right out of the gate, l thought it had a comedic premise to it. Who can blame me? Gregor being turned into an insect and was practically unbothered by it was such an absurd situation, coupled with some lines which made me audibly chuckle. (mainly the part where he wanted to do a simple task as dragging a linen sheet, and there was a bracketed line (this task took him 4 hours)). That was hilarious.</p> <p>Anyway, after I finished the book, I couldn&#39;t help but wonder if turning into an insect was a euphemism (?) for depression. Think about it, struggling to get out of bed in the morning, being shut in his room, losing joy in things he used to love. IMO, this transformation was of a psychological suffering after losing his job, his self worth, being alienated from his family and society alike. It was an amazing read, witnessi
