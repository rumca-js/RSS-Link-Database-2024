And how do we get it out of our inventory, since we can’t sell it?</p> <p>2) can we buy more buildings after we get the barn, coop, and 2 starter buildings we drew at the start? </p> <p>3) we got a shed, and we can store unlimited resources in it… but when / who / how do we take resources out of it?</p> <p>4) At the beginning of each turn, we can trade… but there is no mention of whether that means 1:1 trading between 2 people or if it’s just a free for all where we can all swap tiles however we choose… how do you do it?</p> <p>I think that’s all for now!

I was thinking - if I buy one display: will it guarantee that we can create two decks from display content? I understand that each booster has a base / leader - question is - if it could be that ALL boosters in display will be the same? I didn&#39;t play TCG much, so not sure how it works exactly.

## Is there Murder Mystery-esque boardgames?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all! Very new to boardgaming but our group always loved escape rooms and the like.</p> <p>We played some of the &quot;Escape&quot; games which were great, but for our next night I had an idea of something pretty specific and wanted to ask you guys if something like it exists.</p> <p>So I&#39;m looking for a boardgame that plays like a Murder Mystery. Where someone (host, aka me, or non-player character) gets murdered and everyone plays to find the murderer. Ideally it&#39;s akin to a murder mystery dinner setting and focus on a bit of the social aspect (lying etc) too if possible.</p> <p>Curious what recommendations come up! Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Spaghetti-Enthusiast"> /u/Spaghetti-Enthusiast </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1hgf972/is_there_murder_mysteryesque_boardgames/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/b

Looking at terrain making, it also, surprisingly, gets LOTS of views, but when looking at boardgames, once you remove Dice Tower, SU&amp;SD, and maybe like 3-4 channels, that is pretty much it. Everyone else is sitting at such low viewer count. Yesterday I watched a video about this board game and the girl had a serious production behind her! She had 5 of her friends there, she had cameras from different angles showing all the people playing, she had microphones on every person, great sound quality, a lot of b-roll material, nice colours and vibes, and it barely passed 1000 views. </p> <p>So what is with this hobby that is so popular &quot;to join&quot; but not so popular &quot;to watch&quot;</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/AlexRescueDotCom"> /u/AlexRes

It’s a game I’ve wanted for a very long time but just can’t justify the money for it. I have a both an FSM and SLA 3D printer and the wife has a nice cricket and printer so I figure I could just make my own version so that I may FINALLY be able to own a copy even if it’s just for me and my group to play. I’ve played it before and was instantly hooked but had to take a big gulp of sadness when I saw the secondary market prices. So my question is that if anyone has a complete copy of the jumbo edition if they could DM me with a full component breakdown? Looking at the rules for it I can see there are 141 money cards but it doesn’t say what the breakdown of those are ie how many of each denomination and so forth. Same with the container cards and what not. Any help would be incredible. Also has anyone ever made their own version of this game or o

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Part of why I&#39;ve gotten my kid into board games isn&#39;t just to play; it&#39;s to get them to think and socialize in new ways. Not every game has to be educational, but I take what chances I get and see what interests or sparks. I&#39;m wondering what has worked for other parents to get their kids to think critically, abstractly, culturally, etc.</p> <p>Potentially, any game can do this, but some will be better than others. Ostensibly, we could discuss art or European Renaissance culture when we play Splendor, but outside of the couple of times my son has asked &#39;who&#39;s that,&#39; the conversation doesn&#39;t sustain, and certainly is not of interest during gameplay. Pandemic and Ticket to Ride are a bit different, as even now they can spark one of us to share a &#39;did you know?&#39; question about some city, which is good though often fleeting.
