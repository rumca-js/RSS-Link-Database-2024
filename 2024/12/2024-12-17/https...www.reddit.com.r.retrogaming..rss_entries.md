<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey all, just wanted to ask something to those who have owned a retrotink5x pro and 4k or just the 4k even. Was the jump worth it or the price worth the 4k? I use a samsung 43” uhd 4k tv (oled i think?) and just wanted to know if that retrotink4x is super worth it or if the 5x is close enough to the 4k . My main consoles are the ps2 and wii, and i mostly always play games like gt4, San andreas , Vice city. Some time down the road, i am definitely considering a CRT. But that day is still long away due to space and other constraints, so , is the 4k the super scaler a big jump from the 5x ? Or are they close enough where id be happy with a 5x on my ps2 on a 4k tv too?
