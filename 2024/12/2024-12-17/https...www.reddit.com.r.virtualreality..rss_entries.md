<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Yo</p> <p>So I play with the Bigscreen Beyond with the Valve Index controllers. Lemme be clear, they are amazing and cannot recommend those controllers enough... But the finger tracking is awkward on games where I REALLY need to keep a grip on stuff lol.</p> <p>Like in <a href="/r/BattleTalent">r/BattleTalent</a> or <a href="/r/BladeAndSorcery">r/BladeAndSorcery</a>. Weapons just don&#39;t seem to stay in my hands as much as I DESPERATELY need them to lol.</p> <p>I have a Quest 3 &amp; PSVR 2, but those controllers can&#39;t be used on PC. At least not without staying with their corresponding headsets.</p> <p>I don&#39;t have this issue on the same games on my Quest 3. I want to have the best of both worlds, with the quality &amp; comfort of my Bigscreen Beyond, and the grip of the Quest 3 (or just any controller with it).</p> <p>Any suggestions of controllers with a grip button on them? Links? I&#39;m not too picky.</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_

## How do people with missing upper limbs use VR?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone,</p> <p>I’ve been curious about how virtual reality can be used by individuals with upper limb differences (such as missing one or both hands or missing fingers). VR often relies heavily on controllers or hand tracking, so I’m wondering what kinds of setups, adaptations, or workarounds exist for people who don’t fully use their hands.</p> <p>Are there specific devices, software, or accessibility tools that make VR more inclusive? If you have personal experience or know someone who’s made VR work for them despite missing limbs, I’d love to hear about it.</p> <p>I would really appreciate any insights or stories you’re willing to share. Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/coacopaco"> /u/coacopaco </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1hgdtpk/how_do_people_with_missing_upper_limbs_use_vr/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.c

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>VR is badass. I love it. But having this clunky device on my face, and relying on a controller to move around- it&#39;s inconvenient. It&#39;s incredibly restrictive. Also, being able to actually <em>feel</em> what happens would, at the absolute least, be <em>interesting.</em> I don&#39;t think we&#39;re very close. Matter of fact, it kind of seems like the world forgot about furthering VR tech (I could very well be wrong about this, but from what I&#39;ve seen, that&#39;s how it appears).

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Whenever we see bullshit explanations for things like the Nervegear from SAO, we see all kinds of ridiculous explanations like using magical technology to block signals to the muscles or somehow inducing a dream in an unconscious state.</p> <p>Here’s my prediction for a future VR system: </p> <p>Nothing fancy. Just <em>physically</em> restraining the player.</p> <p>What could happen is you could have free hands with hand tracking like we have now (but maybe with haptic gloves), but for the legs, you could have some kind of strap that holds your legs down. Thanks to having free hands, you can use your hands to strap yourself in or take them off. </p> <p>How do you control your character’s legs? </p> <p>Let’s say you want to extend your leg.

I currently have my modem &gt; older router &gt; WiFi 6 access point &gt; PC, all wired with Ethernet in that order. I’m using an Asus RT-AX55 in access point mode, specifically to use as a dedicated access point for the Quest.</p> <p>I’ve tried AirLink, Steam Link, and Virtual Desktop, and they all end up freezing. My PC has a 7600X3D and a 4080S, and I’ve been trying to play Half Life Alyx. It worked for a bit, until it didn’t, and now any kind of streaming is unplayable. </p> <p>I manually changed the bandwidth of my 5Ghz access point network to 80 to max that out. Is there anything I could be missing at all? All of the routers and the PC are right next to each other, and I am right next to them with the headset. Any help would be appreciated!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/jos
