I installed Bazzite a month ago and it has definitely enhanced my experience to the point where my next desktop GPU will be AMD to install Steam OS on it. However, my only complain is the following: every time I restart Steam or turn on the machine, pretty much all my games download shaders, and it can be something that happens on a daily basis.</p> <p>As there is no option to split shader updates from normal updates, I decided to stop automatic game updates and only update games when I start them. Curiously, DX11 based games are the ones with longer shader cache size, having Persona 4 Golden almost 1gb.</p> <p>That being said, I have read people stating something called &quot;GLP&quot; on GPU drivers make shader pre caching on Steam (Linux) useless. My question is: does this apply as well on DX12 based games t

Running offline installed GOG 1179 Skyrim AE through Bottles on Linux Mint Cinnamon, latest edition, on Intel chip and MO2 2.4.4.

## Help needed with For Honor (Fedora 41)

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>For Honor on Linux runs amazingly, I&#39;m getting super high framerates and am overall happy with the performance. </p> <p>Until it decides to freeze my PC&#39;s entire graphical output, forcing a shutdown about 30 minutes into gameplay.</p> <p>I&#39;m on an nVidia 1070ti, running via proton experimental. I tried other proton versions, lower graphics, enabling vsync, windowed fullscreen and fullscreen, installing another DE, opening a text interface instance and rebooting from there (which it doesn&#39;t even let me do). I&#39;m using the proprietary nVidia drivers. I checked the core percentages, RAM usage, component temps and everything seems to be fine. When running other demanding games like CS2, the same doesn&#39;t happen. I&#39;m down to chock it up as an nVidia moment but if someone has any idea what is happening I&#39;d appreciate it.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/archmage-sully"> /u/

I’ve even tried launching SADX and the mod loader launches and selecting SA2 from the drop down menu, selecting a mod I had already loadings into the mod loader and hitting save and play, SA2 will launch but I’m pretty sure the mod loader isn’t registering my mods or the mod loader it’s self.</p> <p>Sorry for such a long and confusing breakdown, modding on Steam Deck is a lot harder than it looks</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Doc_Doom77"> /u/Doc_Doom77 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1hg1gnd/sa_mod_loader_not_starting_up_when_booting_sonic/">[link]</a><

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am trying to get my OP1 8k side buttons to work in linux as they work in my windows setup. In windows I have bound my side button to a key that I use to crouch or other things in games but the keybinding is not saved when I restart the computer and boot into linux and the software is not compatible to run in linux. If I try to bind it in CS2 for instance, nothing happens when I click the side button. I have tried running the mouse software with wine and with bottles and neither could get the software to run correctly for me as the GUI pops up but is unresponsive. Does anybody have any ideas as to how could bind the side buttons or do I need to just get a different mouse?
