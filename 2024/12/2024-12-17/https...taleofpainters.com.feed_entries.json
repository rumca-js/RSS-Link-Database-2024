With the night's drawing in, if you are like me, you are getting those lamps on and painting away regardless. I am pleased to be able to share photos of my Rogal Dorn Battle Tank. The Rogal Dorn is a \u201cheavy\u201d battle tank, with a vast array of weapon options. The Rogal Dorn can hold a battle line or move forward in a crushing advance with ease.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://taleofpainters.com/2024/12/showcase-cadian-rogal-dorn-battle-tank/\">Showcase: Cadian Rogal Dorn Battle Tank</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://taleofpainters.com\">Tale of Painters</a>.</p>",
