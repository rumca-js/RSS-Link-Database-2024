Building off of Batman and Superman solo animated series and spinning off into Justice League Unlimited, the creatives behind the show lead by Bruce Timm were also creating a blueprint that box-office busting superhero movies and TV universes are still using today. Over a decade before The Avengers officially took over the big screen, Timm and co. set a high bar for superhero team-ups.\n\nBut they also had a secret.\u00a0\n\nBruce Timm was a Marvel guy.\n\nThis is the Inside Story of DC\u2019s flagship team revamping how superhero stories were told on screen, and doing it with the Marvel playbook.\n\nThis Inside Story was written by Charlie Lopresto and Evan Gaustad. Interviews conducted by Mike Avila. The video was produced by Clint Gage and Scott Collura, edited by Justin Donaldson with graphics by Kevin Cappiello.\n\nSpecial thanks to Gary Miereanu\n\nFeaturing Stan Berkowitz, Maria Canals-Barrera, Kevin Conroy, Susan Eise",
