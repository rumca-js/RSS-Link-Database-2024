A lot of elements were implausible, even by 2006 standards, but I got completely distracted by the dog. </p> <p>Let&#39;s suppose you put enough trust in a complete stranger from another country to let them have free rein of your house and car without even meeting them. But you leave your DOG with them too? Did the Cameron Diaz character know the dog was part of the deal? Is the dog just accepting of complete strangers arriving at its house unaccompanied? Also, when the brother shows up there&#39;s no hint that he knows the dog, that it&#39;s happy to see him or anything, and he doesn&#39;t inquire about how it&#39;s doing. (Does the dog even have a name?)</p> <p>If that&#39;s not enough, Cameron Diaz decides just to bail after the first day and makes it as far as airport security before changing her mind.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>If you&#39;re looking for a new Christmas movie to put on this season and haven&#39;t watched the Holdovers, I&#39;d highly recommend it. I put it on later at night, after watching a show for some background noise and ended up being pulled in with its funny but comforting atmosphere.</p> <p>I&#39;m not a huge fan of Alexander Payne his movies tend to be enjoyable but nothing that really stands out, but the chemistry here in The Holdovers works really well. I&#39;m in-between the ages of the younger student Angus and the older mentor Paul, so I could see it from both sides. People coming to terms with their lives and the people they may or may not want in them. Even the cook Mary gives us a great perspective on the outside looking in on these characters lives and why everyone is important and has a story.</p> <p>Anyways its a good holiday movie and if you haven&#39;t watched it yet its free on Amazon Prime and perfect for this time of year.</p> </div>

But I had a lot of fun with the movie. (This is my first movie review, plus I&#39;m pretty tired, so I apologize in advance for how disjointed it may feel)</p> <p>I&#39;ll start with what I disliked, which honestly wasn&#39;t much: There were issues with the pacing and the dialogue, I found some performances a little stilted, and some twists were more expected than others (the Tet being evil was obvious from the get go).</p> <p>As for the positives: Tom Cruise, Andrea Riseborough, and Morgan Freeman delivered great performances I thought. I found myself actually being super absorbed in the plot, and it wasn&#39;t too difficult to follow (like a lot of sci-fi can be), which I liked. I think what everyone can agree on when it comes to this movie is that both the score and the visuals were absolutely top notch. The fact th

Anyway, I was playing on my phone and let the credits roll to the end, and something weird happened.</p> <p>Instead of the usual static that you get when a VHS tape finishes, there was a 3-second blip after the credits. It was grainy and muffled like someone was recording it on a camcorder they were trying to hide. It seemed to be one of the kids dads in front of the clubhouse saying something close to, ‘Take Tish’ (I watched it several times and that&#39;s the closest I could make out.)</p> <p>I’ve Googled it, checked Reddit, and searched YouTube, but I can’t find anyone talking about this. It feels like it could be an Easter egg or an accidental addition, but I can&#39;t make sense of it. </p> <p>Does anyone have a copy of this VHS and if so, does it have the bit at the end like

I mean, 90 years is a <em>looong</em> time! Here are some of the scenarios that came to mind:</p> <ul> <li>Jim and Aurora have kids, and how would those kids have dealt with their lives? Would they have resented their situation and sabotaged the ship? Also, if they don&#39;t wake up other passengers, there could be a risk of inbreeding!</li> <li>What if Jim and Aurora decided to wake up more passengers but ended up waking the wrong ones and it backfires when the new passengers are hostile?</li> <li>The movie shows Aurora forgiving Jim, but realistically, forgiveness isn’t that simple. What if she grew bitter over the years and sought revenge?</li> <li>Jim passes away, leaving Aurora alone. She is unable to figure out how to wake another passenger like Jim did.
