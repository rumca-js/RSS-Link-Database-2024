He\u2019s also a big fan of the Lord of the Rings movies and world, but I think he finds the prose in the books a bit dry/complicated. He really likes learning all about different worlds and characters, and discussing the underlying philosophy/social commentary.

The protagonist is a trans man who deals with family issues, ghosts, and romance of course! I got the rec from Book Tok for Queer Recs. Specifically for trans protagonist with romance at the forefront and I\u2019m loving this book so much! Have anyone else read it? I have a way to go but I\u2019m already 1/3 done with the book on my first day reading it. I got from the public library first because I was not sure if I wanted to buy a book I didn\u2019t like and I might actually get my own. If anyone had any other trans romance books suggestions please let me know!

Can you recommend any books for young kids about family (but not parents) with cancer? My sister is close with my kids and is a highly-involved third adult in our household, but isn&#39;t their mom, obviously.
