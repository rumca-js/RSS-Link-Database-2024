<p dir="ltr">Developer MachineGames has whipped out a second update for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle: a patch that in fact fixes a whip issue for the rugged archaeologist. It's one of many bugs squashed, alongside double-vision issues after nearly drowning and frame-rate stuttering in cutscenes.</p><p dir="ltr">The second update--posted <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/4lXgd5pRCMbAkv9clGQW6A/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-tm-update-2?linkId=100000319960825">on Bethesda's website</a>--aims to address a problem in which Dr. Jones couldn't equip his whip. The Indiana Jones and the Great Circle patch also brings "improvements to global illumination on Xbox." Basically, shadows look even better, with the image quality appearing less washed out. MachineGames also noted that it corrected a problem on PC where global illumination could be disabled because of "playing with below-minimum VRAM graphics cards."</p><div data-embed-type="imageGallery" data-ref-id="6045"><div clas

<p dir="ltr">"There's only so much I can do with hands."</p><p dir="ltr">Raccoon Logic creative director Alex Hutchinson attributes this quote to his animation director, Mike Menillo. It's a funny line, but it's also a short-and-sweet elevator pitch for one of the biggest changes for Revenge Of The Savage Planet, the follow-up to 2020's Journey To The Savage Planet.</p><p dir="ltr">Revenge is taking players out of the head of their characters and placing them over the characters' shoulders, as the first-person view gives way to a new third-person format.

<p>Talk to most collectors and they'll tell you that the pandemic almost five years ago changed the way people buy and sell collectibles. Pokemon cards were heavily affected and some big chain retailers like Target had to limit the number of packs they could sell to customers. They've become such a hot commodity that Japan's news media has reported that the mob is using cards to assist in laundering money.</p><p>As Shunkan Gendai online reports (via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/nongaming-news/pokemon-cards-are-so-valuable-that-criminals-are-using-them-to-launder-dirty-money-japanese-media-reports/">Automaton</a>), criminals have been turning their dirty money into Pokemon cards. The cards' portable size makes them easy to hide and transport, and then they resell the cards, converting their profits into local currency.</p><p>"Many criminals who commit bank transfer fraud are converting the money they steal into Pokemon cards. Shady money can't be deposited in a bank, and th

<p dir="ltr">There might be toilets in Borderlands 4, but the game's narrative director loathes the idea of this leading to skibidi jokes.

<p>Disney Speedstorm is finally starting to get characters from Moana, with the addition of the demigod Maui as a playable racer. The trailer shows off the Speedstorm makeover for the character with his own racing suit and themed car, along with a handful of his special moves.</p><p>As you might expect, Maui is a Trickster class. Tricksters have more Boost than other classes, and can gain nitro fuel by drifting. They also tend to get skills like Hack or Bomb. Maui's unique skill is called Hero to All. The standard version uses his magical fishhook to deliver a huge explosion, while in the charged version, he shapeshifts into a hawk to counterattack and speed past opponents.</p><p>The trailer notes that Maui is available now, and teases that Moana herself will be coming soon too. Like Maui, she appears to have gotten her own Speedstorm makeover and car, with a similar appearance to Maui's. Her skills were not detailed in this trailer.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/moan

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marvel-rivals/">Marvel Rivals</a> recently launched across PC, PS5, and Xbox, with players being able to fight against their friends or online opponents with its cross-play features. A big thing still missing from the game is cross-progression, so players would have all of their progress saved across the different systems. Right now, each of your game's progress is independent of the system you play it on.</p><p>As of now, there is no way of linking accounts to migrate everything into one place. However, the developers at NetEase Games know players want cross-progression and are working towards it. Unfortunately, it's not the easiest thing in the world with a game like Marvel Rivals.</p><div data-embed-type="video" data-ref-id="2300-6465518" data-src="/videos/marvel-rivals-official-rivals-til-the-end-cinematic-launch-trailer/2300-6465518/" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="0">          <iframe height="100%" width="100%"
