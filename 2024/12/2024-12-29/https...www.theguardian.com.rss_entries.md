<p>With 54 minutes gone at the London Stadium Trent Alexander-Arnold took a pass from Ryan Gravenberch with time to wait and look up, the lack of pressure from the West Ham players almost a public snub, before spanking a deflected shot past Alphonse Areola to make it 4-0 to Liverpool and kill off once again a game that was already long since dead.</p><p>In the process Alexander-Arnold did at least provide a moment of cartoon drama, performing a slightly embarrassed silencing-the-chatter celebration, one hand raised to his ear.

<p>A home game against relegation-threatened opposition ought to mean only one thing for Tottenham. Instead, there was an impossible-to-ignore sense of foreboding before and during plenty of this one. It is simply the period that Ange Postecoglou and his players are living.</p><p>Spurs trailed to Hwang Hee-chan, who started his first Premier League game for Wolves since August. They equalised through Rodrigo Bentancur. They missed a penalty, Son Heung-min the culprit. And then they led through Brennan Johnson. All inside the first half. They had the openings in the second period to make it 3-1, to soothe the nerves that were almost audible inside the stadium.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/dec/29/tottenham-wolves-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>When Aaron Ramsdale swapped warming the bench at Arsenal for a relegation battle with Southampton, even the England goalkeeper could not have imagined it would be this bad. Another defeat – a 15th in 19 Premier League games – was especially hard to take after Tyler Dibling had given them a surprise lead to end a four-match wait to score a league goal and their first under the new manager, Ivan Juric.</p><p>But while Ramsdale was angered by the decision not to disallow Trevoh Chalobah’s equaliser for a push on the Southampton goalkeeper, it was only down to a string of fine saves that the scoreline was respectable as Palace secured a second home victory of the campaign thanks to Eberechi Eze’s brilliant finish. That leaves Oliver Glasner’s side looking much more comfortable after their slow start to the season – while surpassing Derby’s Premier League record low points tally of 11 may be the limit to Juric’s ambitions.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/dec/29/c

<p>It was not without the kind of faults that have become the norm of late but Pep Guardiola finally rebooted his winning Manchester City machine in his 500<sup>th</sup> match in charge. “City are back,” came the chants from the away end at the final whistle. Erling Haaland sealed victory, heading in to cap a slick move, kickstarted by the substitute James McAtee. City flicked through gears they have struggled to find in recent weeks, shifting the ball from right to left and Haaland, played onside by Conor Coady, powered in unmarked after meeting Savinho’s cross.</p><p>Savinho got City up and running, feasting on the rebound of a bouncing Phil Foden shot, parried by the Leicester goalkeeper, Jakub Stolarczyk, but City’s second win in 14 matches, and second clean sheet in as many games, was anything but routine.

<p>Electric toothbrushes promise healthier teeth and gums and can transform your oral hygiene. We put more than 20 models to the test to reveal the best for every budget</p><p>If you grew up using a conventional toothbrush – essentially a stick with bristles on the end – you may be surprised to learn just how long the electric toothbrush has been around. The first was designed in the late 1930s, but that model was a long way from the sleek, feature-packed and Bluetooth-enabled beasts you can buy today.</p><p>There are now dozens of ultra-advanced versions on the market, but which ones are worth your cash? For the past two months, my teeth have become figurative guinea pigs to help you find the answer to that question.

Today, there is a new phrase that can freeze the heart just as easily as the sight of a slide projector, and it is: “I’ve done <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/14/family-history-secret-mother-brother">some research</a> into my family history and you’ll never guess what I’ve found out!” A scroll bearing a family tree unrolls to reveal a roster of Jacks and Noreens, leading back to some Charleses and Marys, each perching on ever-more-distant branches and ultimately signifying little about the people who are actually living and breathing around you.</p><p>For me, th

<p>The star’s relentless gurning adds frenzy but little else to this third spin-off from the video game franchise</p><p>Three garrulous alien critters – Sonic, Tails and Knuckles – each with their own distinct skill set and fur colour so lurid that it scorches your optic nerves, are summoned to protect humanity from an evil space hedgehog named Shadow (voiced by Keanu Reeves). Shadow has rage issues, super speed and a gloomy emo-black colour palette. But in this frenetically empty sequel, cluttered with pinballing animated extraterrestrial varmints, the most cartoonish performance comes from a member of the human cast: Jim Carrey reprises his role as the villainous inventor Doctor Robotnik, and takes on a new character, Robotnik’s demented grandfather Gerald.</p><p>While I had more time than many of my fellow critics for the two previous movie spin-offs from the Sega video game series, it turns out that you can, in fact, have too much of a good thing.

<p>Time flies when you’re… in a boring routine, according to research, which shows that new experiences, from foreign travel to a walk in nature, can alter our perception of time</p><p>It’s the time of the year for endless cliches. From “tis the season” and “the gift that keeps on giving” to “new year, new you”, there’s nowhere to hide from tired old phrases. One of my favourites is “Christmas comes around quicker each year” – which ignores the fact that one year equals one trip around the sun.</p><p>There’s often a kernel of truth in a cliche, though.

<p>The late feminist artists explored ideas of doubling and twinship, as well as helping to redefine notions of craft skills</p><p>The photographer Colleen Kenyon made this new year portrait of her identical twin sister Kathleen in 1977. At the time the two of them were embarking on a shared artistic journey that put them at the forefront of feminist artists interested in reclaiming and redefining “craft” skills, using photomontage and hand-colouring techniques to celebrate and ironise traditionally “domestic” artistic expression, such as scrapbooking. Over the subsequent 25 years the twins, born in 1951, pursued this practice at the Center for Photography at Woodstock in upstate New York, where Colleen became executive director in 1981 and her sister joined her as associate director. Together they developed the exhibition space and a programme of workshops to make the institution a prime mover in the advancement of women in the arts, and for artists of colour.</p><p>Their own distin

<p>One quick spritz and your makeup will remain perfectly in place</p><p>Right, let’s get one thing clear. A mist is not the same as a setting spray. There is a difference. A mist – a good one at least – is great for delivering an extra layer of hydration to your skin before you apply makeup. It’s also great for giving skin a midday refresh – especially useful when, thanks to central heating, the stiff air recirculating in your home or office has sucked the life out of your pores. What a mist won’t do, however, is stop your makeup from disintegrating as the day – or night – goes on. That is the job of a setting spray. A quick spritz of this magical potion provides a protective veil to keep your makeup in place. It is the thing that makes it more resistant to lots of things – sweat, oiliness smudging, creasing – that could potentially derail your makeup after a few hours. It means less need to keep touching up. It also means you won’t see photographs of yourself after the event and wo

<p>The novelist had grown up with the much-loved Disney rodent </p><p>In 1992, John Updike wrote, ‘It’s all in the ears,’ in this paean to the world’s most famous mouse and how he achieved iconic status. Updike, an accomplished cartoonist himself, displays a draughtsman’s precision in this extract from his preface to <em>The Art of Mickey Mouse: Artists Interpret the World’s Favourite Mouse</em> (Hyperion), edited by Craig Yoe and Janet Morra-Yoe.</p><p>Updike grew up with Mickey, knew him before he hit the big time. It was ‘a simple love’; he was ‘one of us, a bridge to the adult world’, and provided milestones. Young Updike won a Mickey Mouse piggy bank ‘in a third-grade spelling bee, my first intellectual triumph’. Enthralled by Walt Disney’s comic strips, he dreamed of becoming an animator for Disney. The ears are a stroke of genius: ‘two solid black circles, no matter the angle at which he holds his head’, bestowing a vital ‘surreal consistency’.</p> <a href="https://www.theguar

## Andi Oliver: ‘Life’s too short to be appalling’

<p>The TV personality, chef, musician and author has made her cultural mark, but has faced her fights – racism, violence, grief, poverty as a single mum. How did this nascent national treasure turn trauma into triumph?</p><p>There’s a stockpot simmering on Andi Oliver’s stove – for days, the broth has been bubbling. A mugful of the rib-sticking, rich elixir lands in front of me as I’m ushered into her east London kitchen from the cold. She ladles out a flask-full for Garfield, her boyfriend of 30 years, then peers into the saucepan. “I’ve not been well,” says Oliver, “and this has healed me.” She spent the past two months filming in Stratford-upon-Avon, where she always had a similar soup on the go. “It’s giving yourself the care you need. And sharing it with other people doesn’t just fix you, but briefly, the world around you.” Supplies depleted, she begins to rebuild the brew from its bones: pinches of cloves, juniper and star anise are dropped in. A glug of white wine. Taste, then

<p>The new US president will almost certainly bring unpredictability but several themes will dominate the year ahead. Observer writers offer their guide on what lies ahead in politics, film, fashion, sport and more</p><p>The only thing that can be predicted with absolute certainty about <strong>Donald Trump</strong>’s second term as US president is that it will be unpredictable. Trump does not really know what he wants to do on a range of issues. He talks a good game, which is how he got re-elected. But he often seems to decide policy on the basis of what the last person he spoke to told him. Is he serious about mobilising the military to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/04/donald-trump-mass-deportation-explainer">carry out mass deportations</a> of “illegal” migrants?

<p>When I stopped watching, listening, reading and doomscrolling constantly, I no longer felt I was banging my head against a brick wall</p><p>For as long as I can remember, I have been addicted to broadcast news. At least, I used to be. I would wake up to the babble of Radio 4’s Today programme and for the rest of the day subject myself to a bombardment of destabilising sound effects from the Middle East, Trumpland, PMQs and the odd shouty phone-in.</p><p>It was a habit that was formed long before I became a journalist. My father, a doctor, was a devoted consumer of current affairs. “What’s happening?” he would ask at breakfast. If you started to tell him about your plans for the day, he would listen politely and then say: “I meant, what’s happening <em>in the world?</em>”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/dec/29/how-i-beat-overwhelm-i-kicked-my-news-addiction-and-discovered-ways-to-make-a-proper-difference">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Plans to install huge solar farms in the beautiful Norfolk countryside have outraged residents</p><p>Two years ago, Chris and Jenna Humphrey moved from their urban house to their rural dream. “We wanted our kids to have this,” says Chris, gesturing at the green fields surrounding their cottage, which sits in splendid isolation in the south Norfolk countryside. “It was pitch black when we moved in and the first morning the kids woke up they looked out of the window and there were three deer walking across the field. It was magical for them.”</p><p>They are settled now. Their older children, six and eight, go to the village school and Jenna, a special needs teacher, is nursing their youngest at home. “We fell in love with the house, because every window has such a lovely view. We thought the children would grow up here and never get bored. My little boy is constantly getting the binoculars out, birdwatching from the window.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/
