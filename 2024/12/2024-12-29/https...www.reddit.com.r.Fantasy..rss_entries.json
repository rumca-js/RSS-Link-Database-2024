Her magic often operates in the shadows of perception - glamours, prophecies, blood rituals.

All of his books are excellent, but this one takes it to a different height.</p> <p>I am not done, but while I am reading, I had a weird epiphany. Likely this thought is not new to many of you, and it may already have been a subject of discussion here several times over. But it dawned on me that ALL of Kay&#39;s books are romantansies--the very best kind. A romance/love always is at the core of every one of his books. I guess what could make it not a romantasy is that the lovers don&#39;t always find their happy endings.</p> <p>In any event, for those of you who have not read Kay, I recommend him highly.",

I&#39;ve just finished Robin Hobb&#39;s RotE series and what I&#39;ve been missing the most is Fitz&#39;s beautiful bond with Nighteyes. I would absolutely love some recommendations that feature similar bonds with creatures. I think my favourite aspect of their relationship is their understanding and acceptance despite their differences in reality and perspective (and the humour that goes along with it), as well as the fierce loyalty and love they share.
