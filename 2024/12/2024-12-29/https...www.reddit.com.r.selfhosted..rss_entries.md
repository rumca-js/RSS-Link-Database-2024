I have Immich running on my NAS but I don&#39;t want to use the build in upload as i want to have finer control of the storage, and I don&#39;t want to be dependent on just one system which i might want to change in the future. So what i have now done is, I have created a dataset and mounted it as an external library into Immich as ive seen from others. This works very well but now I have to manually categorize my photos into the folder structure. I could write a python script to automatically upload and sort my photos, but i first wanted to ask whether there is a smarter solution, which I might have missed. Maybe even one I could use from my phone.</p> <p>I would be very happy to hear a

I purchased a RaspberryPi 5 with 8GB RAM, and attached a 1TB SSD using 52Pi N07 HAT. My main goal/purpose is for data backup so I installed OpenMediaVault7, setup SMB, and I also installed Immich, and I was satisfied with that system for a few days. Recently, I wanted to use Immich outside the house but it was challenging to setup Wireguard and then I realized that it might be impossible because my ISP is probably behind CGNAT (if my understanding is correct, it provides my router with dynamic/changing IP address which makes Wireguard incompatible/useless). I do have a spare domain and I was able to successfully setup CloudFlare tunnel, so right now, I am able to use Immich using public internet. And yesterday, or maybe 2 days ago, I was also abl

But unfortunately my ISP is a greedy fuck, so my connection is behind CGNAT. I was looking for a way to set this up without having to purchase a VPS, and I came across <a href="https://iq.thc.org/wireguard-into-a-private-lan-via-cloudflare-tunnels">this article</a>.

Network share &amp; backup for 2 laptops (1 Mac, 1 windows). 2. Pihole redundancy (already running a pi for Pihole) 3. Plex media server for a modest amount of media 4. Roon server 5. Experiment with self-host apps like actual budget, home automation, and others 6. Have a redundancy for the network share files 8. One day maybe have access to files when not at home. Not a critical requirement and lowest priority.<br/> 9. Avoid spending money on a NAS or serious hardware, since I’m still learning and don’t want to heavily invest in a system when I’m still learn
