<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I see people love osm+ maps, I think they are slow but pretty readable. </p> <p>My biggest problem is lack of understanding. I&#39;m trying to plan journey and I search &quot;manchester air port&quot;, I&#39;ve got no results, there is promt &quot;you need to extend radius of searching area&quot;, is there is special way how to find some places? Google maps, petal maps pretty easy, I search for some shop, I&#39;ve got the result. Osm is like a guessing game, most of the time I go with google maps. I hate the way how is zooming in and out without no reason and I&#39;ve got lost.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Negative_Pink_Hawk"> /u/Negative_Pink_Hawk </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/degoogle/comments/1hp5o9p/osm_maps_help_needed/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/degoogle/comments/1hp5o9p/osm_maps_help_needed/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I used albums to organize photos into respective dates &amp; events (Example: 2024.12.31 New Year Eve). I have over 300 albums to share with multiple people, but Google Photos doesn&#39;t have the feature to share all 300 albums with a single link. I have to click &quot;Share Album&quot; 300 times to share each individual albums, and I have 5 people to share it with, which is a lot of work. Plus, I have to repeat that process again if I add new albums. </p> <p>The partner-sharing feature is not what I&#39;m looking for because<br/> 1. It doesn&#39;t show my partner all the albums<br/> 2. It only allows one partner at a time.</p> <p>What other Google Photo storage alternatives which has the following features:<br/> 1. Facial recognition<br/> 2. Multi-user sharing capability<br/> 3. One single link to all 300 albums<br/> 4. The albums in the link with auto update if I add/edit/delete albums.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="ht
