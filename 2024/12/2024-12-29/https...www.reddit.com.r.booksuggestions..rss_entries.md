I really enjoyed the short story concept in the witcher, though I&#39;m not sure if I want to keep reading as I&#39;ve encountered a lot of criticism aimed at the next couple of books in the series. Still, I have the urge to read a good book with the same feeling/writing style as the Witcher with an interesting world to get myself into. Are there any suggestions?

It blends culture and modernism seamlessly and puts forward so many new ways of thinking that can be utilised to improve the world we live in. The first book, Ram: Scion of Ikshvaku, portrays Ram’s hardships growing up as a prince, being shunned for his inauspicious birth, his journeys across India and his meeting with different communities, and, his wife. The second book, Sita: Warrior of Mithila, shows about Sita’s childhood, where she was thought by her kingdom to not be worthy of the throne because of her adoption, her growing up in her Gurukul, her excellent governance of her kingdom and brilliant military strategies, and her meeting with her husband. The third book, my personal favourite, Raavan: Enemy of Aryavarta, showcases the prejudices put on Raavan, and why he was the way he was.

This is the first book I’ve ever read that is strictly to do with the sea. As such, there’s a lot of jargon and sea terminology that I have to keep looking up which is breaking my connection and concentration to the story. I have tried to skip over some words but then I find it difficult to contextualise and use my imagination because there’s no frame of reference for me to attach the words to imagery. </p> <p>I’m wondering if perhaps watching a documentary or the film on Disney+ will help me understand the book better?
