Thus, I would like to disable Proton seeing the right stick. Is this possible?</p> <p>As a side note, I can fix Proton seeing the right stick by editing the registry creating a DWORD named &quot;Map Controllers&quot; set to 0 inHKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\winebus . However, this completely breaks its recognition of the left stick - it seems to consider the entire range of movement to only be the bottom half of the stick&#39;s movement. M",

My last ditch while troubleshooting is to run steam in the terminal and scrutinize the output myself, where I noticed that proton was complaining about a corrupted prefix and being unable to update it, so I deleted it. I didn&#39;t find a single search engine result that said to try doing that for this specific error message, so hopefully putting this up helps someone.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/nbe390u54e2f\"> /u/nbe390u54e2f </a",

There are DX11 games that benefit from GPL and therefore shader caching is not a big deal. (I have found DX11 games have the biggest sized caches, curiously). There are some DX12 games that precompile shaders properly. So we should be able to select which games we want and when we want shaders to be updated for those games (daily, weekly, monthly basis). I have read people saying &quot;just turn that option off&quot;, however, those games that suffer shader compilation stutter on Windows will suffer the same on Linux if shaders are not processed. It is insane that lots of gb get downloaded on a daily basis even for games that simply don&#39;t need it. The tool is great, but why do you think Valve has not polish it? Is it like this on Steam Deck? (I am using Bazzite).</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Joker28CR\"> /u/",
