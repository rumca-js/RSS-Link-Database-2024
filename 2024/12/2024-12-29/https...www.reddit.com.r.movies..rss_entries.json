So a character, usually the protagonist, realizes something important right as the movie ends or as something takes effect that they could have otherwise prevented with this knowledge, and as they realize it, the music swells or the credits roll and they are symbolically left behind as they act crazy or sad or something. This probably sounds like the insane ramblings of a psychopath, but I can&#39;t really describe it any better than that. The best example of this trope I can think of right now is from the song Ballad of Dwight Fry by Alice Cooper around 3 minutes into the song, Cooper goes crazy while the song continues as normal.

I think it is a shame and a downright crime that Warner Bros. decided to release it in such a poor way. The performances are outstanding.

Something has been shoved in his mouth and an enormous needle is slowly descending towards his eye, and it&#39;s quite clear that he is absolutely terrified. I have no other context for this image -- it&#39;s like I was walking past the television while it was on. I have no idea how I came to see this image; it&#39;s not the sort of thing that I would have been allowed to watch as an eight year-old and nor is it the sort of film that my parents would have watched, either.</p> <p>Yesterday, thanks to a random suggestion from the YouTube algorithm, I found out that that image comes from the climax of the 1993 alien abduction film <em>Fire in the Sky</em>.

In Bruges is a near perfect movie to me. Every line, ever scene is important and comes back. Even small things like Chloe saying she needs to make a call after her date with Ray, her calling off robbing him, or the fat Americans climbing the tower, comes back and is important. The only thing that has bothered me for years is why Ken leaves Rays gun in the hotel drawer when he was getting ready for Harry to arrive. As far as Ken knew, Ray was gone. The only thing I could ever think is maybe he thought he and Harry would get in a gunfight and end up back at the hotel, but it\u2019s the only thing in the movie that seems like a total contrivance for the plot later, and not something that seems naturally set up. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Piratedking12\"> /u/Piratedking",
