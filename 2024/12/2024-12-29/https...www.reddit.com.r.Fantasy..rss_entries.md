<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been thinking a lot about how some of the most compelling magic in fantasy isn&#39;t about throwing fireballs or summoning lightning, but rather the unsettling, ambiguous kind that leaves you wondering what&#39;s real.</p> <p>Take Melisandre from ASOIAF/GOT. Her magic often operates in the shadows of perception - glamours, prophecies, blood rituals. There&#39;s always this uncertainty about whether she&#39;s truly wielding power or masterfully manipulating people&#39;s beliefs. That scene where she removes her necklace is more powerful than any magical battle could be.</p> <p>Or Morgenes from Memory, Sorrow and Thorn - his magic is so understated that it&#39;s often indistinguishable from scholarly wisdom and careful preparation. Yet there&#39;s always this sense that he&#39;s operating on a deeper level, seeing patterns others miss. His entire character challenges what we think of as &quot;magical.&quot;</p> <p>I find this approach to magic

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I recently finished the <em>Black Sun</em> books by Rebecca Roanhorse, which I thought were pretty great. In particular what compelled me about the series was how several characters grapple with being invested/influenced by the gods in ways that warp their selves and their lives. The book sets up a really interesting dichotomy between how in many ways the gods influence and power within them allows them to accomplish their goals, but at the same time it warps what those goals are, and something of their humanity and especially their agency is lost.</p> <p>I&#39;m looking for something else that has this as a major story element.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/diffyqgirl"> /u/diffyqgirl </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1hp2szv/looking_for_recs_god_touched_as_both_boon_and/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1hp2szv/

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am a huge fan of Guy Gavriel Kay and have been for quite some time. I love they lyricism of his novels and the world building through his characters. They all are memorable. And the books all are deeply thought provoking.</p> <p>I am currently reading The Lions of Al-Rassan. A poster on here had noted that this was their favorite. I think I concur. All of his books are excellent, but this one takes it to a different height.</p> <p>I am not done, but while I am reading, I had a weird epiphany. Likely this thought is not new to many of you, and it may already have been a subject of discussion here several times over. But it dawned on me that ALL of Kay&#39;s books are romantansies--the very best kind. A romance/love always is at the core of every one of his books. I guess what could make it not a romantasy is that the lovers don&#39;t always find their happy endings.</p> <p>In any event, for those of you who have not read Kay, I recommend him highly.

I have pretty severe ADHD and didn‚Äôt read much growing up, but discovering Audible over the past three years has been life-changing.

I especially enjoy deep worldbuilding and complex, well-developed characters.</p> <p>Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve read so far:</p> <p>Brandon Sanderson: Stormlight Archive (1‚Äì5 + novellas), Mistborn (Eras 1 &amp; 2), and the rest of the Cosmere</p> <p>J.R.R.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I would love some recommendations from you knowledgeable folks for someone trying to get back into fantasy books. I read Tolkien&#39;s books as a teen and loved them. As an adult I haven&#39;t really read any fantasy, but I am looking to get back into a book with that kind of world of magic, kingdoms, and fantastic creatures.</p> <p>Someone recommended Jordan&#39;s wheel of time series, and I have started the first book, but what is breaking the fourth wall for me is the dialogue (sometimes speaking things we would normally only think, maybe to move the narrative? Often presenting unnatural exchanges or cutting off a character&#39;s speech to indicate surprise, like in a comic book), and the way Jordan seems to like telling, not showing his reader (often with IMO unnecessary internal dialogue), or telegraphing reveals from miles away (the stuff about the protagonist&#39;s dad, and the compulsive rethinking and getting angsty about that is what is cur

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><strong>‚ÄúThe Darkness That Comes Before‚Äù is a book I reread twice for two reasons.</strong></p> <p>Firstly, my first attempt wasn‚Äôt in my native language and initially I was struggling a lot. Secondly, this book can be overwhelming thanks to its numerous names, characters and so on. After some time I took a break and forgot important nuances that hindered my understanding of later books of the whole trilogy. That being said, embarking on a journey with R. Scott Bakker you must be prepared for dense, convoluted prose and many tongue-twisting nomenclatue. However, the grim atmosphere combined with excellent, sometimes poetic writing, is what I‚Äôm fond of the most when it comes to reading books set in a fantasy universe. The author nailed it in terms of writing style as well as the construction of the fantasy setting. </p> <p>Taking the plot into account, I rarely had the opportunity to read such a riveting story, even though Bakker only lays a foundatio

I was in and out of the library 3-5 times a week, and could finish a book in a day. Now, as an adult, I don&#39;t have that drive anymore, and I honestly miss it.

I really want to get back in the habit of reading, but it&#39;s honestly a struggle. </p> <p>I have numerous unread books on my shelf that all have a premise that is interesting to me, but I just need to find a way to focus on them.
