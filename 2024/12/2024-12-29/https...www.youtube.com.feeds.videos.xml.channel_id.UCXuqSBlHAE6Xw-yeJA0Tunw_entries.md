Sure, TVs and Monitors have gotten brighter, but NOT BRIGHT ENOUGH! That’s why we embarked on a journey to see how many NITs we can hit, how many lumens we can summon, and use HIGH POWER LEDS to make a display so painfully bright, we are putting ourselves at risk every time we use it. We were too concerned if we COULD make the brightest Monitor in History, that we forgot to ask if we SHOULD.
