<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So, I grew up during the SNES era, enjoyed RPGs (7th saga was my first experience on there, but I&#39;d played dragon warrior earlier on NES, got ff6 later) along with some of the other solid games (Castlevania 4, super Metroid, Mario world of course, link to the past). In college when I first discovered emulators I made sure to experience crono trigger and secret of mana. It wasn&#39;t until years later that I ever even heard of Lufia 2, much less picked up a copy (then some life stuff happened, sold it along with SNES before I got around to playing it, knocked down my house and built a new one), and a few years later still I just got set up with a mister fpga and am giving it a whirl, and damn, this is a good game. The dungeons are great, no random encounters in dungeons is fantastic, the puzzles aren&#39;t toddler level, and the ip skill system is fantastic... For a game that I&#39;d never even heard of during its era, this is a way better game th

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>For those who are not familiar with that game, the game is kind of infamous from a modern gaming perspective because the game contains several copyrighted characters from the Punch Out series as Canadian Crusher is a direct copy of Bear Hugger himself.</p> <p>Secondly, the other infamous aspect of the game is that the music was not exactly original as it was directly taken from the OST of Rocky particularly the Flying High song used in that series for Rocky’s montages.</p> <p>Basically my point is that I wanted to look back at how video games back then were made to try to understand how copyrights worked in general as what surprises me the most about this particular game is again how much artwork it directly took from the Punch Out series as it was so blatant that I cannot believe Nintendo didn’t take any action against the game’s developers at the time Frank Bruno’s Boxing had originally been released.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#3

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Because I would love to play the original version on an arcade emulator, but the most frustrating aspect is that the game is impossible to emulate because it uses a punch button gimmick.</p> <p>My point is that when I look at some arcade games out there such as Time Crisis and again Sonic Blast Man, I sometimes wonder to myself if they can ever be emulated successfully knowing how they worked originally as I know that SMB uses a punch pad, but I still want to play the game anyway without having to look for it in an arcade center.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/KaleidoArachnid"> /u/KaleidoArachnid </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1homkla/i_wonder_if_it_will_ever_be_possible_to_bring_the/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1homkla/i_wonder_if_it_will_ever_be_possible_to_bring_the/">[comments]</a></span>

## Mame/emulator machine with arcade monitor. Bios screen display issues due to high resolution.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have a &quot;legit&quot; CRT arcade monitor in a cabinet hooked up to a modern PC via VGA to play MAME/emulators in pixelated glory.</p> <p>On a few occasions for whatever reason I need to enter into the BIOS screen for the motherboard. Normally this is fine. But arcade monitors are limited to a very low resolution. And annoyingly (for this one edge case) the BIOS of modern PCs now output in too high of a resolution. Higher than then monitor will accept, and/or different refresh rate. So as soon as the BIOS screen loads, the monitor says &quot;no signal&quot;.</p> <p>So I have lug out an LCD monitor with VGA port. Any way around this? Any mobos with low resolution / text mode settings?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/me2352"> /u/me2352 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1holrld/mameemulator_machine_with_arcade_monitor_bios/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a

Donkey Kong freaked me out the most as he covered his eyes and you could barely see that arm covering it in the dark. The worst part us he looked to me like he had a giant oreo cookie stuck in his mouth. And Diddy with one barely opened eye, his face looked grim. And again it scared me how you could barely see their limbs in the dark. They looked like they wanted to scare and haunt you. Even the game over letters looked freaky for some reason. The music was pretty creepy. And it was terrifying how it stopped and was silent with the screen still displayed. Loke that forever until somebody presses something.</p> <p>I even had nightmares about it.
