<p>Disney unveiled the first trailer for its long-awaited, MCU-adjacent animated series <em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/21452835/new-marvel-movies-come-out-release-schedule">Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man</a></em> on Sunday, on the heels of its big <em>What If…? </em>series finale .

<p class="has-text-align-none">YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@OddTinkering">Odd Tinkering</a> doesn’t hold many surprises — other than the disbelief at how good the consoles, controllers, and keyboards they restore look when the work is done. What starts as a broken, dirty Game Boy Color in this video becomes a crisp, clean handheld fit to be a 1998 Christmas present.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The creator, seemingly based in Finland, keeps their name off their channel — but that doesn’t mean they’re totally mysterious to fans. Subscribers often send in their water-damaged, Cheeto-finger-stained, cracked gaming devices to be repaired, and the process is sa
