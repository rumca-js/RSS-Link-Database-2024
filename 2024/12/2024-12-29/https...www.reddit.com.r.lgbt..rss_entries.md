<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So basically…. I am a women I just started my first semester of college this fall. I always knew I was bi, but when I started college I thought I was fully gay, but then I met this guy and we really hit it off so I decided to give him a chance. He’s a super super sweet guy, and we’ve been together for 3 months now. The other day we were talking over FaceTime since we are on winter break now and we were talking about our deal breakers. He said someone who can’t envision a future. That really got me thinking. Idk if it’s just because I haven’t seen him in a long time or if it’s true but when I envision my wedding I can only imagine it with another woman. I can’t imagine staying with him because that means I’ll never be with a woman. He’s coming to visit me the 5-9, should I tell him? And how do I tell him? Or should I wait till we go back to school and see how things go then? I’m so confused 😕 and I feel so bad because we are in the same friend group s
