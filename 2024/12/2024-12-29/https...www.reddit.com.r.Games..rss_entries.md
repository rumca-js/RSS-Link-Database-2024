I am a solo dev working on my dream game &quot;Rain Tactics&quot;. In a nutshell, it is a tactical RPG with roguelike elements set in a dark cyberpunk world where you play a god who wants to die.</p> <p><strong>What makes this game unique:</strong></p> <p>The main character, Winter, is invincible and can one punch almost anything. However, the more he uses his powers, the more likely he is to lose control and destroy the world.</p> <p>So in order to achieve your goal and reach the Gate of Oblivion, you have to constantly choose between unleashing Winter&#39;s godly powers and potentially destroying the world, or risking your champions life into battle (game works with a permadeath system per run).</p> <p>Game&#39;s universe is set in a cyber
