<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This was my first Stephen King book and I went into it completely blind. I picked it up as I loved the idea of a time slip into the past and changing history through it.</p> <p>All the small details about the 50s/60s made it so incredibly immersive. The world around Jake/George felt so real throughout the whole book. The time spent in Jodie was so enjoyable to take in, and I feel SK did a great job of making you feel the contrast of the town with Dallas. </p> <p>But the absolute highlight for me was Sadie and Jake’s life in Jodie. I’ve found myself going back to those initial pages where they first meet, go to the football game and dance at the Sadie Hawkins. Every time the story returned to them after days of spying on Oswald I felt so much more at ease (which I guess was the intention). Call me selfish or a hopeless romantic, but I was really hoping that Jake would stay with her, whether it was in the 60s or 2011, and keep thinking what that would’

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Probably been fifteen years since I read a book for fun. I&#39;m used to reading for school, where I skim to get the most important points, and where things a bit easier to remember because a lot of things are directly built upon previous topics and details. So by reading a paragraph that covers something new, it is also reinforcing what was previously covered.</p> <p>I started reading Dune recently. It&#39;s a great book but it is extremely dense. Every sentence is packed with details that shed light on the characters or universe, foreshadow something, and develop the book&#39;s themes all at once. So it is difficult to read. I&#39;ve been having some neurological and memory issues recently, so to make sure I don&#39;t overwhelm myself, I read one chapter at a time (chapters are only 3-4 pages), wait a few days, then reread the chapter. I reread each chapter 2-3 times.</p> <p>I want to get as much as I can out of the book, and make sure I understand

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I consider myself a thriller book enthusiast and so when I read the premise of An Unwanted Guest, I immediately picked it up. On the surface, the book has a fantastic concept. A bunch of strangers get trapped in an isolated hotel during a snowstorm and a killer lurks among them. Very Agatha Christie esque (whose work I absolutely adore).</p> <p>Unfortunately, that&#39;s where the similarities with Christie end. The major problem with the book is the prose. It is written in the present tense which I found a bit disconcerting but the real deal breaker was how bland the sentences were. The exposition feels too in the face and spoon fed to the reader. This is literally how every paragraph goes:</p> <p><em>X sees that they are heading to the hotel. X is hopeful this would be a good weekend. X knows her friend Y is trying to make her happy. But. X is not happy.</em></p> <p>Prose is very important to the book for me and such style of writing just ruins any

## If you could go back in time so as not to have read only one book, which would it be?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>My reason may surprise you, and I&#39;ll get to it, but first let me get this out of the way: A book being terrible would be the first reason to wish to have not read it. It&#39;s really the wish to have your hours or days or whatever back, time wasted, time that could have been used in reading something else that would have been more enjoyable, informative, and fulfilling. I get that. Someone mentioned a book by Ayn Rand. It was a long book so I think that just makes a worse. So that&#39;s why we got book reviews and why people ask around before making the commitment to read a book or series.</p> <p>But there are a lot of other reasons I can give for wishing I had not read a particular book. I mean the wonderful feeling of reading a book you really liked cannot be repeated. You already know what&#39;s gonna happen and can&#39;t just forget the main story instantly. Unless you don&#39;t read it like for 20 years and never think about it.</p> <p>For m

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi!</p> <p>I&#39;m going to be &quot;in between&quot; houses for the next year or two and what this means for me is smaller storage space and lack of office where I have my library at the moment. I wont be able to fit all the books that I currently have on display. I live in the UK and I have a loft. Has anyone stored books in such space for prolonged periods of time and is able to give me some tips how to make sure the books wont get damaged?</p> <p>Is the combination of clear plastic boxes with the lid and some silica gel enough or should I go with individual air tight packaging for each book?</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/earlesstoadvine"> /u/earlesstoadvine </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hok51p/storing_books_in_the_loft_uk_advice_needed/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hok51p/storing_books_in

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I can FINALLY say I have finished the entire &#39;Dark Tower&#39; series by Stephen King. Here as such Google says: &quot;The Dark Tower series by Stephen King has a total of 4,250–4,720 pages across its eight novels&quot; </p> <p>I can tell you that after reading these....I am IN LOVE with Stephen King. His emotions etched into this series match mine. A perfect ending that brought tears. Every twist and turn of the adventure with perfect timing, never leaving me bored. Creative complex concepts from a pseudo-time-period. A sprinkle of horror, but only to decipher the struggles we face in our lives and how we move past them. Beautiful characters throughout, with hearts of lions. And all in all, love.</p> <p>I also completed my reading goal for the year. Only five books, but a lot of thick ones I&#39;m still reading.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Forward-Elk-3607"> /u/Forward-Elk-3607 </a> <br/>
