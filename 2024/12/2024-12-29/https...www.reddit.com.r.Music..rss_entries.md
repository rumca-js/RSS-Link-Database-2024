<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I just finished watching Arcane and the soundtrack is absolutely fantastic. Every song fits perfectly and is genuinely great even outside of the show. It got me thinking. Do the show writers approach multiple artists for the same scene? Do they let the musicians in on the script? How much of a heads up do they give the musicians? Generally just curious on how the discussions go behind the scenes.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Sometime in the late 1989 or more likely the early 90s, I found an album of space-themed electronic/new age music that I loved, but can&#39;t remember the name or title. It was released on a very small subsidiary label of Capitol Records (I&#39;m pretty sure). It was a solo artist with a first or last name that began with an &quot;A&quot; like Amon or something very similar. One song in particular I remember had a title about &quot;docking with the mothership.&quot; </p> <p>Sorry to be so vague. I would be shocked if someone knows this.

Then there’s Abba’s Waterloo, which says “… at Waterloo, Napoleon did surrender”. A more obscure one is an album track from Marillion, called Hollow Girl, which claims that “… there isn’t a mountain in this whole world that hasn’t been climbed”. Can anyone add to my collection?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Singer songwriters have always played a crucial role in shaping the music industry by creating songs that resonate deeply with listeners. In this discussion, I want to explore the best pop singer songwriters of the new generation, specifically artists who debuted or rose to prominence in the late 2010s and early 2020s.</p> <p>For example, SZA is often celebrated for her incredible lyricism and ability to craft songs that feel both personal and universally relatable. I think her work on albums like Ctrl and SOS has been transformative for modern R&amp;B and pop music.</p> <p>Who are some other singer songwriters you think deserve to be highlighted? Are there specific songs or albums that demonstrate their talent? Let’s discuss their impact on pop music, and how they compare to artists of previous generations.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/AssistanceIll3950"> /u/AssistanceIll3950 </a> <br/> <span

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So, my boyfriend is a huge Rick Astley fan. He’s been obsessed with his cover of <em>“There Is a Light That Never Goes Out”</em> from Glastonbury. Naturally, I started listening to it too because it’s always playing when he’s around. </p> <p>A few days ago, he casually mentioned that the song is actually a cover, and he introduced me to the original by The Smiths. Let me just say, it was like a whole new world opened up for me. I’ve been listening to the entire <em>&quot;The Queen Is Dead&quot;</em> album on repeat, and I can’t get enough. </p> <p>It’s kind of cool how music you love can lead you to discover even more amazing artists. Has anyone else had this experience of falling in love with the original after hearing a cover first?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey Yall - I am trying to get some more information on a pretty obscure set of CDs released in 2003. The &quot;life in balance&quot; CDs were distributed for free with a shower product called &quot;Tilex Fresh shower&quot;. I listened to these CDs growing up and have enjoyed them over the years. This is new age electronic music similar to what Trammel Starks created for the weather channels (some people call it vaporwave now). As a musician myself I have tired over the years to find more information about this music.</p> <p>As far as what instruments are being used I am sure many of the sounds used are from the JV1080 and JD990 though I&#39;m sure other synths were also used. The only individuals credited for these albums are Elizabeth Cantlin and Sara Gilbert. This music is IMO too well made for these composers to have only worked on free CDs in an obscure give away. If anyone has any more information on this music I would appreciate it immensely!!

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So back in 2005ish I found a phantom of the Opera cover by a heavy metal band. I also recall them having a German song so maybe German band?</p> <p>One of their album covers had a girl wrapped in dark purple sheets, I think she was sprawled on a bed. Possibly some roses around. </p> <p>It&#39;s not nightwish.</p> <p>Thanks! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Fluffy_Ad_6581"> /u/Fluffy_Ad_6581 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1homhfs/need_help_in_finding_a_heavy_metal_band/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1homhfs/need_help_in_finding_a_heavy_metal_band/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I mostly use Spotify to stream and listen to music and that&#39;s where I find most of my new music. Occasionally I listen to music on YouTube when I&#39;m at work which also provides some avenues for music discovery as it uses a different algorithm to Spotify but I was wondering if there are really good places to purely find new music from artists I may not necessarily know. All answers are welcome!! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/songsquad97"> /u/songsquad97 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1hokxq9/what_do_you_use_to_discover_new_music/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1hokxq9/what_do_you_use_to_discover_new_music/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Nací en 2005, y como se darán cuenta no tengo mucha experiencia en internet almenos antes del 2012, pero para esos años mi familia obtuvo una computadora por primera vez y era un Windows Vista con capacidades mínimas. Lo que sí recuerdo es que mi prima sabía usar la PC, en ella reproducía en Youtube canciones del tipo Trance y Eurodance. Muchas canciones que nos pasábamos horas escuchando temazos mientras hacíamos la tarea o jugábamos algún juego flash. Luego de muchos años ya estaba establecido en éstos géneros, y solía escuchar con alguna frecuencia este tipo de canciones, en especial los euro. Pero hasta hace poco en Youtube me salió una recomendación de un Mix Nightcore con este tipo de canciones, ya sabía que era un Nightcore y llegué a escuchar algunas, pero ningúna y ni siquiera las canciones tradicionales que llevaba escuchando hace más de 10 años me hizo sentir la nostalgia que sentí con ese video, fue muy fuerte que quise llorar sin ninguna
