It was magical for them.\u201d</p><p>They are settled now. Their older children, six and eight, go to the village school and Jenna, a special needs teacher, is nursing their youngest at home. \u201cWe fell in love with the house, because every window has such a lovely view. We thought the children would grow up here and never get bored. My little boy is constantly getting the binoculars out, birdwatching from the window.\u201d</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/",
