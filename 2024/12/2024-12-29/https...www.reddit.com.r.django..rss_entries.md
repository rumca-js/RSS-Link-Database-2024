<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I know...another open source license post. </p> <p>Just curious how you guys are approaching licensing and Django projects with dependencies? Specifically websites or SaaS - are you looking at the dependencies and their licenses? Wouldn&#39;t any dependency with a GPL require you to be GPL? A lot of variation for example;</p> <p>Celery: BSD License<br/> Django Countries: MIT License<br/> Pandas: BSD3 License</p> <p>Etc.</p> <p>I am building a financial service website (crypto sphere). It might become commercial SaaS down the road. That being said I want the code to be open sourced, and MIT sounds like it would be very permissive. I&#39;m not reinventing the wheel here (I did write some algos that are useful, but nothing that a seasoned programmer couldn&#39;t write better). All the data is on a Postgresql DB, etc. </p> <p>Any downsides to using MIT? Most repos I&#39;m looking at are either MIT or BSD for libraries. </p> <p>I&#39;ve read through hundr

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been looking into various ways of structuring projects (highly recommended since it forces you to look under the hood at the project configuration files). I bough Two Scoops and started there, but also looking at other setups on github.</p> <p>I come from a design background, and having all the app folders along with other folders (templates, config, etc.) always seemed cluttered to me. I&#39;ve currently branched out and testing out an apps folder with the apps nested and other than having to type &quot;apps.app1&quot;, &quot;apps.app2&quot;, etc., there doesn&#39;t seem to be a downside and the project looks more ordered (IMHO).</p> <p>Is there a downside to this type of structure? What has been your experience so far? I&#39;m currently branched out in case it doesn&#39;t work well so I can revert to the old structure.</p> <pre><code>Project core settings.py apps app1 app2 app3 templates manage.py </code></pre> <p>EDIT: I can&#39;t seem to

## How do you manage sending mails with SMTP with all analytics and tracking on SES?
