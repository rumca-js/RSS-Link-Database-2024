## Miniflux - scraping of non-RSS feed sites?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I noticed this item listed in the Features list for Miniflux under <a href="https://miniflux.app/features.html#content-manipulation">Content Manipulation</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>Custom scraper rules based on CSS selectors</p> </blockquote> <p>I&#39;m a little confused by that. Does that suggest that Miniflux can create, in theory, unlimited web page scrapers that appear as standard feeds? If so, does their paid hosted option support this too? </p> <p>One of the reasons I stick with Inoreader is the reliable web scraping it offers to Pro users in the form of their &quot;web feeds&quot; but if Miniflux offers this too, I would really consider switching. Any current user that can shed a little light on this for me? Thanks</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/chickenandliver"> /u/chickenandliver </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1hp7ydi/miniflux_scraping_of_nonrss_feed_sites
