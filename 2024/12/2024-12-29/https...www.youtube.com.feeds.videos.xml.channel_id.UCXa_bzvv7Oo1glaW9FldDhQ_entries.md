The Dino Crisis franchise has drawn hundreds of thousands of fans with its unique premise and enchanting gameplay, but it’s long absence from the market has definitely left a void in the hearts of players. 

Whether a new game will be released in the future is something that remains to be seen, we do have a new and promising alternative to look forward to in the form of PALEOPHAGE. Currently in development at LogDev, PALEOPHAGE feels like a great modernization of Dino Crisis complete with a new over-the-shoulder perspective and fitting survival horror mechanics. 

There’s quite a bit of potential if LogDev plays its tactics right, and PALEOPHAGE might just end up as one of the biggest surprise hits of the near future.

Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 arrived in May, offering a solid action adventure with incredible visuals. S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl and Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 launched back-to-back, and despite many issues, both solidified themselves as enjoyable experiences. 

Meanwhile, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle ended things on a high note as one of the year's best games. Let's look at other big titles that Xbox Series X/S owners should get their hands on.
