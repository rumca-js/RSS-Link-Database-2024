## I didn’t know Threat Level Midnight was largely based off of an actual movie, Sudden Death.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Sudden Death is a ridiculous movie. At no point can you take it even remotely seriously. </p> <p>Early on, Van Damme has his probably toughest fight in the entire movie against a 110 pound model in a mascot costume. </p> <p>Van Damme then spends the rest of the movie trying to save his kids who got caught up in a plot to kill the vice president along with every one else in the stadium. </p> <p>He’s dodging machine gun fire from bad guys throughout the entire film while a very important hockey game is going on. </p> <p>However, Van Damme does find a way to make it on to the ice as goalie to make a very important goal save in the third period. He then signs “I love you” to his son in the stands. </p> <p>After watching Sudden Death I feel like Threat Level Midnight may be a more sane movie than what this movie was. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/1ThousandDollarBill"> /u/1ThousandDollarBill </a> <b

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I just finished watching The Shawshank Redemption for what feels like the zillionth time, and yet, it still overwhelms me with emotions. I’m sitting here in tears, completely moved by its brilliance.</p> <p>Brooks’ story always breaks me. His struggle to adjust to the outside world after a lifetime in prison, and that devastating letter before he takes his life, hits so hard. It’s a painful reminder of how freedom can feel like a prison when the world has moved on without you.</p> <p>But then there’s Andy and Red’s friendship—a beacon of hope amidst all the despair. The bond they share is so pure and life-affirming. Andy’s unshakable optimism and Red’s journey from cynicism to hope is the heart of the movie. That scene where Red finds Andy’s letter by the stone wall? It gets me every single time.</p> <p>This film is such a masterpiece, balancing the crushing weight of despair with the uplifting power of hope and connection. What do you guys feel when

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>With something like 110 feature films under his belt, Takashi Miike is the first that comes to mind for me. Even just in the “family” comedy genre , the range between happiness of the katikuris and visitor Q is astonishing. The former is actually close to family friendly (with the exception of one shot Iirc) and the latter is one of the most OTT-taboo-laden and shocking movies of all time —and both are hilarious. Of course he is most known for shock value and stylized violence, but the restraint and patience of the first 2/3 of Audition is unparalleled and truly makes the last act hit harder than anything I’ve ever seen. Taking the time to develop the characters and story makes all the difference, although much of the credit there belongs to the author of the novel, Ryu Murakami. Still, it is a really faithful and wonderful adaptation.</p> <p>I’m not even sure of another director with as many films, let alone as much range. Looking over to the west,

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t think of any specific instance of this happening in a film, but I just love the idea and want to see some examples of it. So a character, usually the protagonist, realizes something important right as the movie ends or as something takes effect that they could have otherwise prevented with this knowledge, and as they realize it, the music swells or the credits roll and they are symbolically left behind as they act crazy or sad or something. This probably sounds like the insane ramblings of a psychopath, but I can&#39;t really describe it any better than that. The best example of this trope I can think of right now is from the song Ballad of Dwight Fry by Alice Cooper around 3 minutes into the song, Cooper goes crazy while the song continues as normal.

And while Hal/Titan isn&#39;t portrayed as dangerous/evil as Syndrome is (he never tries to kidnap or kill children, at least not on camera), he&#39;s still a very disturbing concept, as in &quot;What if an incel type got superpowers?&quot; His behavior towards Roxanne was creepy from the start (the guy has a cutout of her over his bed with &quot;GOOD NIGHT HAL&quot; added to it, yikes), but once he gets superpowers, it just gets to another level. Especially once she gently turns him down, because then his sense of entitlement and rage at rejection causes him to go to some very dark places.</p> <p>The sequence where he shows off his powers by taking her flying especially shows this off. The scene is of course a parody of the classic Superman and Lois flight sequence in the original film, but in that, Superman invi

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Honestly, Van Damme should have played Balrog instead of Guile. He was completely miscast and he would have been a much better choice for Balrog. His athleticism and good looks made more sense for Balrog and I wish Van Damme, at that time, had played a bad guy. He had more range than he believed and I could see him do Balrog justice. </p> <p>But that isn&#39;t the part I was most pissed about. Guile should have never been the lead, he&#39;s more of a strong supporting character and he certainly should have been played by someone like Brad Pitt, not Van Damme. </p> <p>The most offensive part was sidelining Ken and Ryu into this comedic duo. They&#39;re pretty much shown as losers who are easily fooled and go through the movie like bumbling idiots. So disrespectful. I&#39;d rather they had not used them if this project was only intended to be a Van Damme vanity project. </p> <p>There were two characters I feel they got right. Raul Julia is the MVP as B

In it, a man is bathed in light and his head is being forcibly tilted back by a device. Something has been shoved in his mouth and an enormous needle is slowly descending towards his eye, and it&#39;s quite clear that he is absolutely terrified. I have no other context for this image -- it&#39;s like I was walking past the television while it was on.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>In Bruges is on of my favorite movies. I think this and 7 psychopaths, also from Martin McDonagh are unbelievably underrated movies. In Bruges is a near perfect movie to me. Every line, ever scene is important and comes back. Even small things like Chloe saying she needs to make a call after her date with Ray, her calling off robbing him, or the fat Americans climbing the tower, comes back and is important. The only thing that has bothered me for years is why Ken leaves Rays gun in the hotel drawer when he was getting ready for Harry to arrive. As far as Ken knew, Ray was gone. The only thing I could ever think is maybe he thought he and Harry would get in a gunfight and end up back at the hotel, but it’s the only thing in the movie that seems like a total contrivance for the plot later, and not something that seems naturally set up. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Piratedking12"> /u/Piratedking

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I know people have already talked this movie into the ground, but I just watched it, I&#39;ve been binging cheesy romcoms and holiday hallmark movies, laughing at them with my friend, then looking at reviews for them, and I haven&#39;t seen anyone mention this.</p> <p>The movie sucks! But what bothered me the most was the fact that I don&#39;t think anyone in The Kissing Booth 2 actually knows how to play DDR. Marco did a flip on it? Later, he and Elle did something like the tango? They were off the panel—the game would not register any of it! And yet they got full accuracy??</p> <p>I get it&#39;s a romCOM, but this bothered me so much!</p> <p>Did this bother anyone else? Any thoughts?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/TheDarkAngel_2"> /u/TheDarkAngel_2 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1holsvx/the_kissing_booth_2_does_not_know_how_ddr_works/">[link]</a></span> &#32

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>i was scrolling through i think netflix a few weeks ago and saw a movie that i wanted to watch when i was with my partner again as i am currently traveling; however i can’t for the life of me remember the name and the vague details i remember about it is not enough to help me search the internet. wanted to come here to see if y’all may know. the poster was of a woman laying on a medical evaluation table and it was a darkish room with just a harsh light illuminating her. the description i remember was something about how the woman was being held as a medical prisoner or something and her husband was either trying to save or get revenge (vague i know) if any of y’all know the movie i’m thinking of, this would be amazing! thank you so much</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Alternative-Bar5155"> /u/Alternative-Bar5155 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1holshg/help_with_
