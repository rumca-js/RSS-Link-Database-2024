Does that suggest that Miniflux can create, in theory, unlimited web page scrapers that appear as standard feeds? If so, does their paid hosted option support this too? </p> <p>One of the reasons I stick with Inoreader is the reliable web scraping it offers to Pro users in the form of their &quot;web feeds&quot; but if Miniflux offers this too, I would really consider switching. Any current user that can shed a little light on this for me?
