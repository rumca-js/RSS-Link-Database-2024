The Linux kernel can in turn invalidate TLB entries on remote CPUs without needing to send IPIs and without having to wait for remote CPUs to handle those interrupts. Synthetic benchmarks shown in that patch series were very promising and thus I carried out some benchmarking over the holidays of this AMD INVLPGB support for the Linux kernel.",
