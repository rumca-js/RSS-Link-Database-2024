You could place trap cards face down that would activate if someone did what the card describe, such as “whoever takes a sip of their drink has to draw X cards”. Trap cards also worked to counter other cards such as if someone put down a card that targets you, you’d counter with trap card.</p> <p>The actions are more silly than I just described and with enough people one game

I was going to have a get-together with some friends and I was wondering how doable it is to play the game with more than 5 people? I presume the easiest way would be to get the expansion packs and put them together but I wasn’t sure how that would all work?
