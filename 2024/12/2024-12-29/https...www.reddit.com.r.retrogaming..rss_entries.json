In college when I first discovered emulators I made sure to experience crono trigger and secret of mana. It wasn&#39;t until years later that I ever even heard of Lufia 2, much less picked up a copy (then some life stuff happened, sold it along with SNES before I got around to playing it, knocked down my house and built a new one), and a few years later still I just got set up with a mister fpga and am giving it a whirl, and damn, this is a good game. The dungeons are great, no random encounters in dungeons is fantastic, the puzzles aren&#39;t toddler level, and the ip skill system is fantastic...

Normally this is fine. But arcade monitors are limited to a very low resolution. And annoyingly (for this one edge case) the BIOS of modern PCs now output in too high of a resolution. Higher than then monitor will accept, and/or different refresh rate. So as soon as the BIOS screen loads, the monitor says &quot;no signal&quot;.</p> <p>So I have lug out an LCD monitor with VGA port. Any way around this?
