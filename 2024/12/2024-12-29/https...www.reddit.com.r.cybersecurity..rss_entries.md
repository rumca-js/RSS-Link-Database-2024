<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I was on X earlier and read about quantum computers potentially breaking current encryption standards, leading to a &quot;harvest now, decrypt later&quot; situation where data is collected today to be decrypted in the future when quantum capabilities are more advanced. </p> <p>I may be late to the party here, but this sparked my overly threat-oriented mind into thinking about a not-so-distant future where we could face a lot of attacks from orgs with access to quantum capabilities. </p> <p>I used to work in a company that had multiple contracts with gov agencies, and a breach there could be devastating... </p> <p>Any heard any conversation around quantum-resistant algorithms? How would that even look when transitioning infrastructure? </p> <p>I&#39;m not sure how much of it is hype versus real threat.
