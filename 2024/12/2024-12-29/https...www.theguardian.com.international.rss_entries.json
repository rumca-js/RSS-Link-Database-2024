Then, as prime minister from 2004, he forged a new relationship with the US, ended India\u2019s nuclear isolation and passed groundbreaking social legislation. In all this, he was bolstered by his reputation for absolute honesty, a considerable asset in the world of Indian politics.</p> <a href=\"https://www.the",
