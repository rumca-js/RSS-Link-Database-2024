        "description": "I colorized, restored, and designed the sound for this 1929 video of Liverpool, capturing its vibrant streets, iconic landmarks, and bustling docks. Trams glide through the city alongside horse-drawn carts, painting a vivid picture of a metropolis where tradition meets progress. From grand civic buildings to the ceaseless activity of its ports, Liverpool\u2019s energy and innovation are palpable. The film highlights a city deeply connected to its maritime heritage, alive with movement and modernity.\n\nVideo Restoration Process:\n\u2714 FPS boosted to 60 frames per second \n\u2714 Image resolution boosted up to HD \n\u2714 Improved video sharpness and brightness \n\u2714 Colorized only for the ambiance (not historically accurate)\n\u2714added sound design only for the ambiance\n\u2714restoration:(stabilisation,denoise,cleand,deblur) \n\nPlease, be aware that colorization colors are not real and fake, colorization was made only for the ambiance and do not represent real historical data.\n\nB&W Video Source: BFI (Free)\nB&W Video So",
