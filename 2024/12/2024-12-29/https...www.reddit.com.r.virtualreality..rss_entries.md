<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><h1>Intro</h1> <p>Hello everyone. Roughly 3 years ago, I had an Oculus Rift S on loan from a friend and I enjoyed the experience, but I didn&#39;t know if I wanted to invest roughly 500 EUR (at the time) for a VR setup.</p> <p>A few days ago, me and some other friends had a get together, and one of them, had bought a Pico 4 for roughly 205 EUR (used) and this peaked my interest, cause I was willing to spend that much.</p> <h2>Existing hardware and priorities</h2> <ul> <li>I already have 2 desktop PCs, between which I plan to move the VR setup. One has an i7 4790k and an RX 580, the other has a Ryzen 9 5900X and a GTX 1080.</li> <li>Both use a wired connection, and I don&#39;t have a Wifi 6(e) compatible router.</li> <li>I am basically only looking to play room-scale PCVR.</li> <li>Play space is about 300cm x 165cm</li> <li>I plan on mostly playing Beat Saber (probably 85%+ of my playtime will be in this game), Euro Truck Simulator 2, HL: Alyx, Superhot,

## Bit confused about Virtual Desktop. I understand that some games can launch directly from VD, but for others, is there any benefit to launching Steam VR through VD as opposed to simply launching Steam VR without VD?

I even have a couple Virpil HOTAS for stuff like Star Wars squadrons. I&#39;ve read a few ideas to get this working, trying to find the most effective / easiest setup that makes sense.</p> <p>Right now it is a WiFi 5 &gt; my computer. Gets a bit over 600 up and 120 down (yay Xfinity). I bought one of the recommended 6e wireless routers as a dedicated router for a Meta 3 I recently purchased. Without running an Ethernet from my new router to the existing, is there a fairly decent way to do this? I read something about how 5 and 6e are different frequencies, so you can connect to both. Also read having the new WiFi as AP only. And also something about setting it up as a wireless bridge.</

The psvr2 is going for 350$ rn brand new, I have a ps5 AND a good pc, which i will need to buy the psvr2 adapter as well to use it on PC. It’s tempting to get a psvr2 right now, I could probably have it in my hands in about an hour, but im not sure the drawback is worth it. I have no idea when the q3 refurbished models will be back in stock, could be tomorrow could be 2 months. The lens are the biggest draw back for me, fresnel lenses are super outdated, and i remember my q2 always having horrible god rays and looking like a blurry mess especially when watching movies in it in a virtual dark environment which is really when you notice how shit the lens are. But i really want feedback from someone who has used both of these, through the lens comparisons don’t re

After researching a bit I&#39;m in between these two, which are approximately the same price around the $1k mark.</p> <p>On one hand, I really like the idea of the small form factor and OLED of the BSB, but really turned off by the idea of having to do a back-and-forth with customer service to troubleshoot any potential issues, as it seems a lot of people have to do, as well as the $200 restocking fee if it turns out it&#39;s not for me.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So long story short I’m buying a valve index off a good mate of mine but the headset comes with no base stations and I’m not really sure what the major difference is other than the fact that the 2.0 covers more space and has a higher fov, although that could be good for others that doesn’t really apply for me because my room isn’t that big. I know for sure I’m not properly educated on the base stations so if anyone could just tell me the purpose of the base stations and what the major differences between them are I would appreciate it greatly.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/poiuytrdfv"> /u/poiuytrdfv </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1hopdqp/whats_the_difference_between_a_10_and_20_base/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1hopdqp/whats_the_difference_between_a_10_and_20_base/">[comments]</a></span>

I’m open to both titles from the Oculus Store and PC VR games.</p> <p>Most importantly, should I set my expectations high or low?

I&#39;ve absolutely loved it. Super easy to set up hardware, intuitive controls, an adapter so I can fit my glasses, and even the WMR bullcrap isn&#39;t the worst all things considered. I pretty much just use it to screw around and shitpost on VRchat (as well as a means to hang with the girlfriend while we&#39;re apart), but...I love it.</p> <p>So when I looked into some to buy for said GF, I was horribly disheartened to learn that it didn&#39;t do well and that HP was dipping out of the VR market. Like, I was genuinely bummed out, heartbroken even that there wouldn&#39;t be a G3 or any real support.</p> <p>So, as has been asked many times with few real clear answers...what would a good upgrade path be going forward for me?

I currently have a meta quest 3 and have used it with the PC to achieve this. However, I find myself not using it that much because it is always difficult to connect to the PC (it requires a bunch of steps to connect over the link or air link, it’s always requiring an update, it seems to require the quest software to be running to use it, the battery powered controllers are always running out of batteries (I don’t need the controllers for MSFS), and I need a whole account on Meta just to operate the VR. I don’t want or need the standalone gaming. In short, it’s not a great user experience for in and out gaming on the PC.</p> <p>I was wondering if there are other high quality comparable headsets that are geared to PC gaming and don’t have the added complexity of a separate OS or login or entire overlay that just delays getting to the gaming.
