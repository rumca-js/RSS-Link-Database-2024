The Mbororo tribe, a semi-nomadic subgroup of the Fulani people, are pastoralists renowned for their dedication to cattle herding, which is central to their livelihood and culture. Predominantly found in Central and West Africa, they are known for their striking appearance, colorful traditional attire, and unique blend of Islamic faith with animist traditions. Organized into clans, their society emphasizes strong kinship ties, traditional gender roles, and cattle-centered rituals. Despite their rich cultural heritage, the Mbororo face challenges like land disputes, marginalization, and the pressures of modernization, which threaten their traditional way of life.
