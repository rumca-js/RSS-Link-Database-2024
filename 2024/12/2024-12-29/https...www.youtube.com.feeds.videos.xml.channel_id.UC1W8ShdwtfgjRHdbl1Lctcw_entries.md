I colorized, restored, and designed the sound for this 1929 video of Liverpool, capturing its vibrant streets, iconic landmarks, and bustling docks. Trams glide through the city alongside horse-drawn carts, painting a vivid picture of a metropolis where tradition meets progress. From grand civic buildings to the ceaseless activity of its ports, Liverpool’s energy and innovation are palpable. The film highlights a city deeply connected to its maritime heritage, alive with movement and modernity.

Video Restoration Process:
✔ FPS boosted to 60 frames per second 
✔ Image resolution boosted up to HD 
✔ Improved video sharpness and brightness 
✔ Colorized only for the ambiance (not historically accurate)
