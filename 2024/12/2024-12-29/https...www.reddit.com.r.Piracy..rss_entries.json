I do my SDR video editing in the free version of DaVinci but is there any software that can edit existing HDR10, Dolby Vision profile 8, or Dolby Vision profile 5? I just want to remove 2 short scenes from an existing file and not lose the HDR metadata.</p> <p>Ideally I&#39;d want to not lose the DV RPU either (for the first 2.5h before the first edit) and also keep the JOC metadata in the associated DDP Atmos audio track. I have a feeling that for the parts I want to actually edit l&#39;ll lose DV/Atmos but all the edits I want to make are in the last 20 minutes of an almost 3h video.</p> <p>I have 4 copies of the video file in HEVC SDR, HEVC HDR10, HEVC DVp8, and HEVC DVp5, all with bit-identical eAC3-JOC audio. Container is irrelevant here since I can use ffmpeg to swap it to whatever I need.
