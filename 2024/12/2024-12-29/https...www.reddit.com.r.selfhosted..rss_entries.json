This works very well but now I have to manually categorize my photos into the folder structure.

Do I correctly understand that by having SATA enclosure with two M.2 disks inside performance will be divided by two? So once slower? Same in case 5x M.2 in single 3.5&quot; SATA enclosure? Speed will be slower, divided by 5?</p> <p>Another matter? If I fit two 256GB M.2 in to 2.5&quot; SATA enclosure, how computers will recognize it? As one whole disk of 512GB? Or two separated disks of 256GB? If two separate, do they get separate UUIDs?

I can setup OpenID through Authentik and it works, but without the forwardAuth middleware in Traefik, users can still access the Proxmox login page without authenticating first. </p> <p>What I&#39;m looking for: Prevent users from even accessing the Proxmox login page before authenticating.

To still be able to tinker I configured myfritz (as I have a Fritzbox) and wireguard. Wireguard worked flawless at first, but somehow a few days in it won&#39;t connect because &quot;error bringing ub tunnel: unable to resolve host name&quot;.</p> <p>I did not change anything, just toggled wireguard. Did I forget some option to fixate a DNS address and fritz changes it every few days by default? </p> <p>Thank you guys in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Momphus\"> /u/Momphus </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1hojioc/need_vpn_help/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1hojioc/need_vpn_help/\">[comments]</a></span>",
