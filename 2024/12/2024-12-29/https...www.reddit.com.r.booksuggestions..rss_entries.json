It blends culture and modernism seamlessly and puts forward so many new ways of thinking that can be utilised to improve the world we live in. The first book, Ram: Scion of Ikshvaku, portrays Ram\u2019s hardships growing up as a prince, being shunned for his inauspicious birth, his journeys across India and his meeting with different communities, and, his wife. The second book, Sita: Warrior of Mithila, shows about Sita\u2019s childhood, where she was thought by her kingdom to not be worthy of the throne because of her adoption, her growing up in her Gurukul, her excellent governance of her kingdom and brilliant military strategies, and her meeting with her husband.

As such, there\u2019s a lot of jargon and sea terminology that I have to keep looking up which is breaking my connection and concentration to the story. I have tried to skip over some words but then I find it difficult to contextualise and use my imagination because there\u2019s no frame of reference for me to attach the words to imagery. </p> <p>I\u2019m wondering if perhaps watching a documentary or the film on Disney+ will help me understand the book better? Or will this ruin the book for me? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/LemonCurdJ\"> /u/LemonCurdJ </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r",

Hopefully this isn&#39;t too specific a request, but I want to find my Mustang-loving, literature-loving friend a book featuring Mustangs, or cars in general. He likes classic literature, and I&#39;m looking more for a fictional story, or a true story, not a non-fiction list of facts (unless theres a really good one out there!). I&#39;m hoping to find something as gripping as the Ford v Ferrari movie in book form.
