I seem to recall that pairs and other dice combinations were more effective and I think there was also a resource gathering element as well but I can\u2019t remember. </p> <p>Gameplay was centered around upgrading your board in a tableau/engine builder style to add more dice, increase the value of the dice, make combos more consistent, etc; while simultaneously building your pyramid(s). </p> <p>What\u2019s worse is the friend I played with has no memory of this game so it all might be a fever dream. </p> <p>Thanks in advance for helping me find this game, it\u2019s been bugging me for ages. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/use",

Since then I have been wracking my brains about the woodland alliance and how it actually works because the instructions aren&#39;t very clear and it feels like the Woodland Alliance is at a disadvantage throughout the game. The people I was playing with also were struggling to understand so I&#39;m thankful it&#39;s not just me (a collective brain loss perhaps).</p> <p>To emphasise my point, I want to put across a worst case example that hopefully will help people understand where I am having trouble. If I have misinterpreted the situation please let me know as this may be where I am coming unstuck.</p> <blockquote> <p>Woodland Alliance starts with nothing on the board</p> <p>Birdsong: There is no sympathy at this stage so you cannot revolt. Spread your first sympathy, perhaps more.</p> <p>Daylight: Craft if you have anything, or add a card to the supporters",
