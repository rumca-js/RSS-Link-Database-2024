The game is inspired by games such as Journey, Firewatch, What Remains of Edith Finch, Brothers, etc.</p> <p>Kinsfolk is a short emotional single player adventure game about fatherhood. As the main character, you will embark on a journey to discover the meaning of family. Explore the beautiful world with atmospheric music.
