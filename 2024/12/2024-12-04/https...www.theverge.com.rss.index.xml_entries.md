  <p id="3WRwH2">Jeff Bezos and President-elect Donald Trump famously didn’t get along the last time Trump was in the White House. This time, Bezos says he’s “very optimistic” and even wants to help out.</p>
<p id="sr3Pvr">“I’m actually very optimistic this time around,” Bezos said of Trump during a rare public appearance at <em>The New York Times </em>DealBook Summit on Wednesday. “He seems to have a lot of energy around reducing regulation. If I can help him do that, I’m going to help him.”</p>
