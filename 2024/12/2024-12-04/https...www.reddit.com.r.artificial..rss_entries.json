I even decided to start a Saas business providing users access to tailored prompts for people to use to help them generate content, come up with ideas, analyze reports etc. However, I am noticing that a lot of the products people are raving about are products that obfuscate the prompt and/or use the API to do all of the prompting on the backend so the user just gets the output after filling out a few text fields.</p> <p>Is this you all&#39;s experience? Do you prefer having someone present a form rather than just plugging in a prompt into ChatGPT or is it that you think people just don&#39;t really know how to use LLMs or prompt? I&#39;m genuinely curious what you all&#39;s take on this is.</p> <p>Thanks in advance</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Alternative_End_5295\"> /u/Alternative_End_5295 </a> <br/>",
