        "description": "WELCOME TO SPEARHEADZ! This casual gaming series is going to explore Warhammer's new format of fixed-list casual gaming. This wide-onramp new system for playing Games Workshop's cosmic-fantasy wargame is perfect for the kitchen-table game crowd and is perfectly suited for where I'm at with gaming. \n\nToday the third SPEARHEAD to finish his boxed set is Mike from Epic Duck Studios! He's throwing down against my Skaven with his freshly painted Kharadron Overlords! He's also brought in the very cool SpearHeadz Terrain kits so we can use our old game boards to play this new Age of Sigmar Battlepack!
