They largely played well, but the graphical overhaul they received included low-quality AI-upscaled art, substandard models and awkward use of ancient animation data. Players also often levied one key aesthetic criticism: that the remasters didn't align closely enough with the originals in terms of lighting and colour, with a less stylised look. That's all set to change with patch six, which promises a new classic lighting mode and myriad other fixes - but does it do the job, and how have the other changes affected the final product? </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-gta-definitive-edition-does-patch-6s-classic-lighting-mode-finally-fix-the-look-of-the-games\">Read more</a></p>",

Midway through my year-six school trip to the Isle of Wight we'd gone on a day trip to Blackgang Chine - a kind of magical theme park of sorts where we were told Queen Mary in 1920 had her hat knocked off by a massive whale's jaw bone. Anyway, that's not important. We'd come inside to a cafe area as it had started to rain. In this cafe I have two of my most vivid childhood memories: hot cinnamon flavoured hard round sweets and a <a data-keyword=\"true\" href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/games/virtua-fighter\">Virtua Fighter</a> arcade cabinet. As a young lad who'd essentially learned to read and write largely off the back of Mean Machines SEGA magazine, you can imagine my excitement.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/how-blockbuster-and-a-mail-order-catalogue-helped-playstation-defeat-t",
