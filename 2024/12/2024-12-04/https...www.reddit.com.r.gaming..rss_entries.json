I have loved games such as The Last of Us, Days Gone, Zelda and so many more and I played almost every day especially since the ps3 days. Recently my hands and wrists have gotten a little painful so I haven\u2019t played in a few weeks. The thing is I don\u2019t miss it. Right now as it stands if I never played again it wouldn\u2019t kill me. It made me wonder how many of us are playing for the love of gaming or because it\u2019s become an easy habit to fall into. When was the last time any of us stopped playing for a week just to catch our breath so to speak? This is a hobby that can consume thousands of hours.Maybe we should set aside some of those hours in levelling ourselves up rather than our avatars. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/TemperatureTime1617\"> /u/TemperatureTime1617 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https",
