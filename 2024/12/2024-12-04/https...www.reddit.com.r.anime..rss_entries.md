But now that I have, I see that on all of MAL, AL, and Wikipedia, it&#39;s only described as a drama or drama/SOL, with no mention of romance. Is this just a case where it doesn&#39;t rise to the level needed for the tag, or is there actually no romance at all?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Good evening, I hope this post finds you well.</p> <p>After reviewing posts related to my subject, I&#39;ve come across a broad range of romance anime, however none really grabbed my attention. In other words, I suppose I have a very acute taste in romance anime.</p> <p>At this point, i&#39;m inclined to blindly pick an anime to watch. I would be ever so grateful if a kind netizen would assist me in choosing something suited to my tastes.</p> <p>I&#39;ve enjoyed watching <em>Bunny Girl Senpai</em>, which has had an everlasting impact on me as a person; as well as <em>Darling in the Franxx</em>. I would say these are my two favorite ever. I recently enjoyed <em>Horimiya.</em> I would say I enjoy the thrilling, most intimate moments of the romance. I also think I enjoyed the art style of these three. If it helps, just like the anime listed above, I too am a high school student. Any suggestions are welcomed and will be entertained.</p> <p>Best regards,

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>2019-2020; first season premiered and it&#39;s almost everywhere you can imagine. Very popular, but after the manga ended and second season came and went, it feels nobody talks about Beastars anymore. Even with the third season about to release, I don&#39;t see any real talk about it. It&#39;s so strange to me to see a series that was so popular feel like it never existed and fall from it&#39;s place. Anyone else feel that Beastars has kinda faded away as the years have gone by? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Clean-Cupcakes"> /u/Clean-Cupcakes </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1h653uh/why_did_beastars_decline_in_popularity/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1h653uh/why_did_beastars_decline_in_popularity/">[comments]</a></span>
