<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have a LG V20 that I&#39;d love to have just as a low-tech but still secure device. Obviously this is both dated and also not in Graphene&#39;s support system. It&#39;s been in a drawer so I&#39;m not worried about it having some compatibility issues, but if there is any idea of what I should be running, I&#39;d love some recommendations. I&#39;m pretty set with other software recommendations, just gotta get started.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/they_ruined_her"> /u/they_ruined_her </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/degoogle/comments/1h6ky51/grapheneos_seems_to_be_the_goto_android_distro/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/degoogle/comments/1h6ky51/grapheneos_seems_to_be_the_goto_android_distro/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>My quick list:</p> <ol> <li>Firefox Browser - never used Google Chrome much.</li> <li>Tuta Mail and Tuta Calendar - Gmail and Google Calendar are overloaded with features which I don&#39;t like.</li> <li>DeepL - it&#39;s better than Google Translate and it has all the languages that I need.</li> <li>F-Droid - or direct apk instead of Google Play.</li> <li>Bitwarden - Never tried Google Password Manager</li> <li>OpenStreetMaps - But sometimes I need to fall back to Google Maps (eg for traffic congestion updates). Is there a better alternative?</li> <li>PeerTube - I watch YouTube via PeerTube, but in the end it&#39;s still YouTube. Any suggestions here?</li> </ol> <p>Lastly, I still use Google Docs and Google Sheets. If anyone could hint me to a better alternative, I&#39;m all ears!</p> <p>What&#39;s on your list?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/petelombardio"> /u/petelombardio </a> <br/> <span><a

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been using a GrapheneOS phone for a little while, and it doesn&#39;t support Google&#39;s Theft Detection Lock feature. I&#39;ve tried an app called Private Lock, but it runs as a background service, crashes often, isn&#39;t up-to-date for the current Android API, and doesn&#39;t work super great.</p> <p>Is there an alternative app that maybe hooks into Google&#39;s APIs so it doesn&#39;t have to run as a background service, or at least can do so in a low-battery-consumption way (maybe similar to <a href="https://github.com/KieronQuinn/TapTap">https://github.com/KieronQuinn/TapTap</a> ?) and is updated?</p> <p>(this is still de-googling b/c it&#39;s not Play Services related stuff; I might be using a Pixel, but I&#39;d rather not have Play Services in charge of controlling the hardware in this way)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/goose1212"> /u/goose1212 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https:/
