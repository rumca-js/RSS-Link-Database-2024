<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all! We are a gamer couple lol but I only got into gaming deeply like 3 years ago so I’m more interested in modern games or games in the last 10-15 years. My boyfriend however has been gaming since he was a toddler and loves games like pokémon games, Zelda, sonic, old cod games etc etc. this probably isn’t like SUPER retro as we are in our early twenties but from his childhood essentially. he has replayed pokemon ruby probably a million times lol. He emulates a lot of games, is interested in old consoles, he loves Scott the Woz on YouTube. Just idk I got him two things off his Christmas list that are PlayStation 5 related but I wanted to add something that he didn’t have to explicitly ask for and is more tailored towards his likes. I know he is super interested in retro gaming and just looking for some gift ideas! Nothing crazy expensive I’d say try to stay under 100$ unless it’s something unbelievably awesome but yeah thank you guys:! </p> </div>

From what I see the game was released on PS1/N64.</p> <p>I was considering the super cheap (aliexpress) consoles on a stick because they come with 2 controllers but they seem a bit underwhelming for PS1/N64.
