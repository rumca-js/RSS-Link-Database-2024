<p>It took just a few years for AI art to evolve from text to 2D imagery to generated 3D video. Today, it’s taken the next step with Google’s Genie 2, which can generate playable 3D game worlds that are constructed on the fly, all from a simple text prompt.</p>



<p>Google’s Genie 2 is the evolution of its Generative Interactive Environments, which uses AI to construct new, interactive environments on the fly. <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2402.15391v1">Genie 1</a>, which Google released in February, could construct 2D environments. Now, Genie 2, <a href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/genie-2-a-large-scale-foundation-world-model/">which Google announced today</a>, takes that into 3D space.</p>



<p>Google calls Genie 2 a “world model,” which means it can simulate virtual worlds, with animations, physics, and object interactions. It’s a two-step p

<p>Did you know that Microsoft Edge, the built-in web browser on Windows PCs, can read text out loud to you? It works for text on web pages, PDF and Word documents, and more — an incredibly useful feature, particularly for users who have impaired vision.</p>



<p>Here’s how it works: In Edge, navigate to the web page with the content you want to listen to. Highlight a selection of text using your mouse cursor, then right-click and select <strong>Read selection aloud</strong> in the menu.</p>



<p>Once you do that, a toolbar will appear at the top of the browser. Here, you can click buttons to Pause/Play reading and to skip backward/forward through the selection line by line. The toolbar also has a <strong>Voice options</strong> button, which you can use to change the reading speed and the text-to-speech voice.</p>



<p>Alternatively, you can have Edge rea

<p>After months of dropping hints about a password-sharing crackdown, Max will begin “messaging” suspected streaming freeloaders starting next week. </p>



<p>“We will kick off literally in about a week,” Warner Bros. Discovery streaming exec JB Perrette said during a Wells Fargo tech and media conference on Tuesday, <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/max-password-sharing-crackdown-strategy-kick-off/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as The Wrap reports</a>. </p>



<p>Max’s initial password-sharing crackdown will be more akin to a warning, with some “early, gentle messaging” to streamers “who we think are definitely in the higher tier of usage.” That appears to be the extent of Max’s account-sharing crackdown for now. But sometime early next year, the streamer will roll out “a way to essentially add a member,” Perrette said. </p>

<p>Logitech’s MX series of mice is probably the best regarded line outside of the gaming space, and the family might be a little bigger than you think. In addition to the flagship MX Master and travel-friendly MX Anywhere, the MX Vertical is a favorite for its ergonomic design.</p>



<p>And right now, Amazon has a rare sale on this specialized mouse, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Vertical-Wireless-Mouse-Rechargeable/dp/B07FNJB8TT/">selling it for just over $76</a> with a 24 percent discount.</p>



<p>The MX Vertical, like other vertical mice, is rotated so that your hand sits at a more natural and comfortable position. Logitech says its 57-degree angle “reduces the pressure on your wrist, while your thumb is positioned comfortably on the thumb rest.” This is a matter of preference, of course. Only you can decide if you like it over conventional

But if you’ve been watching the company’s gaming aspirations over the last few years, you might also want to peek over at the Steam Hardware Survey, an ever-present source for juicy hardware trends. There, Intel’s Arc GPU family just made its debut in November, with 0.19 percent of Steam gamers using it.</p>

<p>Would a mini PC qualify as a stocking stuffer? Well, it depends on the size of the stocking, I guess. But if yours is big enough, here’s an amazing one to throw in there: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/GMKtec-i5-12450H-Windows-Computers-Display/dp/B0CWQ941FC/">GMKtec’s M3 mini PC is just $350 now on Amazon</a>. That’s $100 off with the on-page digital coupon.</p>



<p>This mini PC features an Intel Core i5-12450H CPU and a whopping 32GB of DDR4 RAM. That’s more than enough processing power and memory to handle all sorts of work tasks and day-to-day activity like browsing the web, streaming Netflix, and some moderate gaming.</p>



<p>The integrated Intel Iris XE Graphics G7 GPU may not be the greatest, but it’s still enough to support demanding graphics apps. In fact, it can support up to three 4K@60Hz displays, with two connected via HDMI ports and one

<p>The Dell S2721QS features a gorgeous 3840×2160 IPS display with a super-thin bezel. That’s always good, not just because it looks sleek and stylish but because it lets you put two of them side by side with minimal interruption down the middle. Note that it only has a 60Hz refresh rate, though, so don’t expect to game above 60 FPS on this thing.</p>



<p>This monitor’s IPS panel with HDR10 support delivers vibrant colors, deep blacks, and great contrast. The integrated Eyesafe technology filters out blue light at the source while maintaining vivid colors, which

<p>There’s no denying that ChatGPT and other AI chatbots make impressive chat companions that can converse with you on just about anything.</p>



<p>Their conversational powers can be extremely convincing too; if they’ve made you feel safe about sharing your personal details, you’re not alone. But — newsflash! — you’re not talking to your toaster. Anything you tell an AI chatbot can be stored on a server and resurface later, a fact that makes them inherently risky.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="why-are-chatbots-so-risky">Why are chatbots so risky?</h2>



<p>The problem stems from how the companies that run Large Language Models (LLMs) and their associated chatbots use your personal data — essentially, to train better bots.</p>
