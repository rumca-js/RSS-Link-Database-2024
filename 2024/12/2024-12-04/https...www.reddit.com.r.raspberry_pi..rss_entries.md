<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello Community,</p> <p>I am having trouble understanding how kernel booting works and which package manages kernel updates.</p> <p>I have a Raspberry Pi 4, and a few days ago, I upgraded to Debian 12 (Bookworm) from Debian 11 (Bullseye).</p> <p>To check the kernel version, I ran: </p> <p><code>uname -r</code> </p> <p><code>6.1.21-v8+</code></p> <p>I assumed this was an older version and that it could be updated. However, I thought the update would happen automatically with apt full-upgrade, but that doesn&#39;t seem to be the case. Otherwise, the kernel would already be updated to a more recent version (I did run apt full-upgrade).</p> <p>After some research, I found that the kernel can be updated using:</p> <p><code>- linux-image and linux-header</code></p> <p><code>- raspberrypi-kernel</code></p> <p><code>- rpi-update</code> </p> <p>I noticed that I didnâ€™t have linux-image or linux-headers installed, but I did have raspberrypi-kernel.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello! </p> <p>I am extremely new to Raspberry Pi in general. Essentially, I received a few of them for free as they were thought to be broken, but at least one of them works perfectly fine (Raspberry Pi 4 Model B). I then decided I wanted to use the Pi for a digital &#39;sign&#39; in my office to show me the overall status of my work sites. All I originally thought I&#39;d need to do is have the Pi automatically open Chromium to a certain URL and call it a day. </p> <p>I then realized in order to actually show all the information at this particular URL I would need to scroll the window down and back up continuously; I attempted to do this with an xdotool script that would just run continuously on startup, but I either don&#39;t know what I&#39;m missing (most likely) or Raspberry Pi and Xdotool don&#39;t work well together. </p> <p>I&#39;m just curious if anyone has a general idea of how this idea might work and could just point me in a direction to

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>My Raspberry 5 has currently an M.2+ HAT for SSD purposes, and I wanted to attach some sensors to it. By the way the HAT is built it blocks the GPIO pins, and after reading the schematics it seems that the pins number 3 and 5 (GPIO 0 and 1) are unused in this HAT but the documentation of the HAT+ spec states those pins are used for hardware ID. I&#39;m not sure how to interpret that, does anyone know? Is there a better alternative for just plugging some 4 pin sensors to the pi and reading some data from them?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/McOmghall"> /u/McOmghall </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1h67nz0/using_m2_hat_and_sensors_on_pi_5/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1h67nz0/using_m2_hat_and_sensors_on_pi_5/">[comments]</a></span>
