Ben discusses the distrust of American institutions, such as the weaponization of the FBI, and how this helped Trump win the election. Ben goes on to mention the full-scale weaponization of law happening by one particular party in South Korea. He also talks about something good happening and something not-so-good happening. The good thing is President Trump is planning to attend the reopening of Notre Dame in Paris, but the no-so-good thing is the rare mineral export ban from China to the US. China is creating supply chain warfare by cutting down the ability of the US to obtain manufacturing materials.

Ben discusses how Trump‚Äôs foreign policy will be different from Biden‚Äôs and the recent stance Trump has already taken against Hamas holding hostages. Since Hamas cares most about grabbing more territory, a proposal was put forward to suggest recognizing parts of Gaza as a permanent Israeli buffer zone if Hamas does not give up the hostages. He also talks about the ceasefire that was violated by Hezbollah when they fired at Israeli-controlled territory this week.
