        "description": "Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora was originally praised for its incredible level of immersion, allowing players a ground-level experience of being in the imaginary world of James Cameron\u2019s movie franchise. Its latest DLC release, Secrets of the Spires, hopes to double down on these feelings with its expanded flight-based abilities and more vertical zones. \n\nUnfortunately, the new flight abilities, while novel, quickly wear out their welcome, and the DLC generally feels strained under the weight of the core game\u2019s weaker points, including the fact that the grind for crafting materials to get better gear is still present. The DLC\u2019s story is also quite boring, and once again has players taking on RDA soldiers.",

        "description": "Speculatively dealing with the impact of technological advancement or future societal and environmental change is what makes science fiction such an imaginative genre. Sci-fi \u2013 as a backdrop \u2013 is used countless times in video games, with shooters arguably dominating sci-fi\u2019s influence across the medium, with Halo, Half-Life, and Mass Effect \u2013 for example \u2013 regarded as some of the best video games ever created. \n\nThere\u2019s no shortage of sci-fi shooters available now and upcoming, the chance to wield technologically fantastical weaponry throughout well-realised glimpses of future civilisation is too evocative to resist for game developers and players alike. The fifteen included in this rundown harbour just a small selection of sci-fi shooters upcoming for 2025 and beyond.",

        "description": "While many play video games to relax, it's no secret that others favor a challenge. They don't want to face insurmountable bosses but to succeed against overwhelming odds. There's a certain satisfaction in accomplishing the impossible without facing real danger. \n\nThis year has seen some pretty exceptional titles that can provide a variety of challenges. Frostpunk 2 offers all the moral challenges of managing a post-apocalyptic city like the original but throws in far more systems and a healthy amount of bureaucracy that you can't fail. \n\nElden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree goes above and beyond the base game in terms of boss battles, providing some of the most spectacular fights in FromSoftware's history. S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl is more about patience and endurance as you survive against harsh conditions, Anomalies, and Mutants. Meanwhile, Dragon's Dogma 2 turns your open-world perceptions on their head and punishes you for not adapting. Check out several other brutally d",
