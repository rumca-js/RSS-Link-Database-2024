Learn how to Build a Stable Diffusion VAE From Scratch using Pytorch. VAE stands for Variational Autoencoder. It's a type of Autoencoder and a neural network that trains using an unsupervised technique. They are widely used in Image generation models mainly on latent diffusion-based and GANs-based image generation models.
