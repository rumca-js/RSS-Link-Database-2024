While many play video games to relax, it's no secret that others favor a challenge. They don't want to face insurmountable bosses but to succeed against overwhelming odds. There's a certain satisfaction in accomplishing the impossible without facing real danger. 

This year has seen some pretty exceptional titles that can provide a variety of challenges. Frostpunk 2 offers all the moral challenges of managing a post-apocalyptic city like the original but throws in far more systems and a healthy amount of bureaucracy that you can't fail.
