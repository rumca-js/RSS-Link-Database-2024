I&#39;m also sorry if the post is too long.</p> <p>I have several domains and I wanted to use them for email forwarding to a certain email address of mine. First, I tried <a href="http://forwardemail.net">forwardemail.net</a>, it worked and it&#39;s free (improvmx and some other services limit how many domains can be registered in free tier, this one is not). The thing is, it doesn&#39;t work for most of my domains because those domains are TLDs that are banned on forwardemail because they deem them to be prone to spam usage. If I&#39;m not mistaken, I can bypass this by paying them some dollars per month per blocked domain, which may make it expensive for me because I have several domains.</p> <p>I tried cloudflare&#39;s mail forwarder too, but it needs me to change the nameservers of my domains to theirs.
