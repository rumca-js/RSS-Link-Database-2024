My wife and I love board gaming together, and she is actually a seamstress! So a game about dress making is obviously right up her alley. We have the newer deluxe plus edition, which had everything but that little figure. She was bummed to find out ours didn&#39;t have that when we got it. I&#39;d love to surprise her with that as a Christmas gift, but I can&#39;t find it for sale anywhere. Eagle griffens site only lists that as a gift to add to rococo if you&#39;re buying the game in their holiday sale, but no where to just get the queen. </p> <p>If you have the game and don&#39;t care about the little figure of the queen, please message me! Or even if you know where to buy it.</p> <p>Thanks</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/BigFish_89\"> /u/BigFish_89 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgam",

Overall I enjoyed it.</p> <p>+ An atmospheric world, fairly interesting characters, well-developed setting (specifically within the borders of Dragonholt village, although there is an interesting information on Terrinoth setting in general, too)</p> <p>+ Freedom of action within the village. You can meditate in a temple, you can go explore an abandoned crypt (if you meet some conditions), you can arrange a tavern fight, you can help an old man to find family happiness, you can simply chat with everyone... The only limitation is time available</p> <p>+ Choices made by you earlier have a serious impact on the plot</p> <p>+/- Extremely minimalistic combat; it is not even D6 dice, as in all other gamerbooks. It is simply &quot;if you have a skill suitable for combat - good, no \u2013 get injured.&quot; There is no random at all. Someone may like it, someone may not so much</p> <p>- Co",

Something like &quot;You can use this resource differently&quot; or &quot;You start with these items instead of these items&quot;. These usually come in the form of a game &#39;faction&#39; or &#39;character&#39; that you choose during set up, but could also be varied player boards or ability cards etc.</p> <p>I&#39;m curious what games like these folks would recommend, as I&#39;m always on the look for more! Bonus points if they also have secret goals / end game scoring features!</p> <p>For reference, I&#39;m talking about game like;<br/> - Terraforming Mars<br/> - Dune: Imperium<br/> - Apiary<br/> - Caverna: Forgotten Folk</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Spaghetti_Cartwheels\"> /u/Spaghetti_Cartwheels </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1h66yuz/games_with_unique",
