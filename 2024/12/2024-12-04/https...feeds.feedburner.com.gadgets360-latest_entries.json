The findings indicate that while insects like mealworms can eat and degrade plastics, their slow consumption rate makes them impractical for large-scale plastic waste management.",

Using 35 years of data, researchers found that rising nighttime temperatures significantly reduce the head rice rate (HRR), especially in Japan and China. The study also identifies solar radiation, precipitation changes, and vapor pressure as contributing factors. Projections suggest worsening impacts on rice quality, posing challenges for sustainable food security in the region.",

Researchers suggest the site\u2019s abandonment may reflect local resistance to hierarchical governance, offering fresh insights into the social dynamics of ancient societies",

        "description": "New research suggests that dark matter may have originated from a \"Dark Big Bang,\" a cosmic event distinct from the standard Big Bang. Proposed by scientists at Colgate University, the theory explores scenarios where dark matter could have been introduced into the universe up to a year after the initial Big Bang. Unlike regular matter, dark matter interacts only through gravity, making it elusive to detect. The study, published in Physical Review D, identifies gravitational waves as potential evidence for this theory, which could be detected by advanced experiments like the International Pulsar Timing Array. If confirmed, the \"Dark Big Bang\" could revolutionise our understanding of dark matter and its unique relationship with the rest of the universe",
