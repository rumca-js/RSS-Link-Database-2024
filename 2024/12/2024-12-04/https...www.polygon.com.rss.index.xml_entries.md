<p class="has-text-align-none">Gran Turismo developer Polyphony Digital will release a new, free-to-play version of <em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22957121/gran-turismo-7-review-ps5">Gran Turismo 7</a></em> on Friday under the name, <em>My First Gran Turismo</em>. Ostensibly a demo version of Polyphony’s “real driving simulator,” <em>My First Gran Turismo</em> is more interesting for what it’s trying to do: appeal not just to racing sim enthusiasts, but players aged “7 to 77”, <a href="https://www.gran-turismo.com/us/products/myfirstgt/">according to its official website</a>, “who have yet to experience Gran Turismo.”</p>

Intended to be an intense, raid-style endgame challenge for groups of players, the Dark Citadel is the first content in any Diablo game to require<em> </em>multiplayer. Diablo games have always had optional co-op, but they have also always been fully playable solo — until now.</p>

My Dimengeon device, a contraption that allows me to “bank” monster encounters, was nearly overflowing, so I had to take out over 40 enemies in a single battle. I continued to advance, thinking that the threats had been eliminated, yet numerous encounters piled up within mere seconds.</p>
