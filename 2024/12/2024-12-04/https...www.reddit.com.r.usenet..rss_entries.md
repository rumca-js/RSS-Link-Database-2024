<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Have been with them for ages, despite having alternatives. They sent a letter indicating they will now be adding a VPN and increasing their prices at the next billing cycle. Has anyone else received this?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>** Update, issue seems to be with Easynews servers in the Netherlands. </p> <p>Not sure what has changed in the past week, but all my usenet downloads are crawling, I am lucky if I get above 500KB. I&#39;ve checked my settings and connection to servers, firewall isn&#39;t reporting anything suspicious either and my bandwidth has been fine.</p> <p>So far in troubleshooting I have done the following:</p> <p>- updated Sabnzb from 4.1.x to 4.3.3</p> <p>- installed all windows updates and rebooted</p> <p>- reviewed cpu performance and ram, cpu never goes about 20% and ram sits around 3GB of 8GB</p> <p>- tested connection to switch, then to firewall using wireshark</p> <p>- tested bandwidth behind firewall and and directly connected, getting 300mb each way</p> <p>- Not sure if its related to usenet servers in Europe, but easynews seems to be my biggest culprit even though i have the priority set at 90. I use 2 other usenet services for download at 0 and 1,

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have paid subscription of DS, Geek, althub, Finder, NC, and dog. Providers I have are NH and easynews. Is there any chance of missing any article?
