After lots of rest and PT, it was suggested by my PT at the time (also a gamer) that I transition to VR which truly helped my lower back issues. Recently though I woke up with a pinched nerve, mri showed bulging discs and a mild annular tear at C-6/C-7, C-7/T-1. I had an epidural and am waiting to see if it helps. I&#39;m wondering if it was the VR that did me in, could have also been when I was painting my ceiling, who knows. My question is have any of you come back to VR after a neck injury like this?</p> <p>I use a Quest 2 with the BoboVR halo and external battery, comes in at about 1000g but it&#39;s balanced.

On the one hand, it seems like on paper that the 7090 XTX is the better value purchase. It has more memory, is cheaper, and performance seems either comparable or sometimes better that the 4080 S.</p> <p>The downside I can see to buying it is it seems like a lot of VR games and VR in general is optimized for Nvidia cards and not Radeon cards. At least that is what I have read and seen on youtube.</p> <p>Does anyone have any information on this? Do Radeon cards have issues with VR? Especially if I plan to use the Quest 3 as a cordless connection to the PC to play PCVR games?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Legitimate-mostlet\"> /u/Legitimate-mostlet </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1h6ojz3/any_proscons_between_an_4080_s_and_7090_xtx_one/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/",
