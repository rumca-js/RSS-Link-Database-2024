<p>Lawyers argue that sitting president is ‘immune from indictment or any criminal process, state or federal’</p><p>Donald Trump’s attorney in Georgia has asked the state’s appellate court to dismiss election interference charges against the president-elect, arguing that a sitting president “is completely immune from indictment or any criminal process, state or federal”.</p><p>The filing by attorney Steve Sadow before the Georgia court of appeals asks the court to dismiss Trump’s appeal of a lower-court decision to allow Fulton county district attorney Fani Willis to remain as prosecutor on the case, because the Fulton county superior court no longer has jurisdiction, given Trump’s electoral victory.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/04/trump-georgia-election-interference-case">Continue reading...</a>

Mothers, as a rule, are not known for their ungenerous assessments of their sons’ behavior. But Penelope Hegseth, the mother of the Fox News personality Pete Hegseth, Donald Trump’s nominee to lead the Department of Defense, once did just that in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/29/us/politics/hegseth-email-text.html">an email to her son</a>.</p><p>“I have no respect for a man that belittles, lies, cheats, sleeps around and uses women for his own power and ego,” Hegseth’s mother wrote to him. “You are that man (and have been for years) and as your mother, it pains and embarrasses me to say that, but it’s the sad, sad truth.” The email – which Hegseth’s mother later disavowed – appears to have come around the time of the dissolution of Hegseth’s second mar

<p>Trump deported 1.5 million people in his first term; it’s now suggested he’ll remove 1 million a year in his second term</p><p>When Donald Trump takes office in January, his administration plans to ignite the “largest deportation operation in American history” to rid the US of people he has claimed are “poisoning the blood” of the country.</p><p>The steps required to carry out this kind of campaign, which his supporters clamored for with “mass deportation now” signs at his rallies, would be unprecedented. It would involve made-for-TV raids designed to instill fear and menace. It would require the cooperation of local law enforcement. Tents would be put up for people to wait in before being sent away. Hundreds of thousands could be deported quickly. The incoming president plans to use obscure laws to justify these removals. Places previously seen as off-limits to immigration agents, like churches or schools, could become targets.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/202

<p>The president-elect’s two main arguments for his tariff threat – to reduce migration and to combat drugs – are not credible</p><p>“To me, the most beautiful word in the dictionary is tariff, and it’s my favorite word,” said <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> last month. Pundits, politicians and financial markets are trying to figure out why, since he announced a week ago that he would <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/25/trump-mexico-canada-tariffs-border">impose tariffs</a> on the United States’s three biggest trading partners: 25% for Mexico and Canada, and 10% for China.</p><p>One theory is that tariffs can be a beautiful distraction. Trump, more than any previous US president, has fed on distractions for years, both to campaign and to govern. He can move seamlessly from one distraction to the next, like a magician preparing for the opportune moment to pull a coin from where it appears to have been hidden behind your e
