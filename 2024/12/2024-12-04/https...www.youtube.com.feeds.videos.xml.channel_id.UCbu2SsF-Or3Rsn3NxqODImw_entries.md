Logan was born with the gift of razor-sharp claws and a powerful healing ability that allowed him to live for centuries. However, when the secretive government organization, Weapon X, shaped him through unspeakable pain and horrific experimentation, his humanity was forfeited to evolve him into an animalistic instrument of destruction. Now, having risen above his trauma, the Wolverine fights for what’s right, defending both Mutants and humanity. 

His world has become even more chaotic when the Timestream Entanglement began erasing entire realities. Now, Logan divides his time battling Doom 2099 and helping guide time-lost Mutants to safety on the island of Krakoa.
