I\u2019d really love a book with fun, page-turning adventure and a fun group of friends! bonus points if it\u2019s a series!! I\u2019ve already read the Davinci code and I thought it was alright, but i\u2019m looking for something a little less mature. Specifically a YA or romcom type, you know? Maybe a fantasy with a romance subplot would the best fit. Please leave your suggestions!

I tend to go for rom coms with witty narration and lots of banter. RWRB, Boyfriend Material, &amp; Bridget Jones are some of my 5-star reads from this genre. </p> <p>\u2744\ufe0fFantasy - doesn\u2019t need to be specifically Christmasy, but immersive worlds that have a strong sense of winter would be great. (Six of Crows scratched this particular itch perfectly last year.) </p> <p>\ud83c\udf32Nonfiction - cozy, winter-y, maybe nature-related, or some",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hello,</p> <p>I made the vow to myself to read a book, since I haven&#39;t in a long time, andI just finished the metamorphosis by Franz Kafka. It was very good. It made me feel frustrated and unsatisified for the main character. It took me a few weeks to get through the beginning of the book because I was busy and it seemed boring, but after page thirteen I read the rest of the book in one and half hours.</p> <p>This was the first book that I&#39;ve read to completion in maybe six years (Im 20M). The last book I read before this one was Midnight Thief by Livia Blackburn, and I&#39;ve read that maybe four times.</p> <p>I&#39;m looking to read my next book to read and I would like some recommendations to do so. I&#39;m not looking for any genre in specific, just something semi short, (more than 50 pages but less than 300) and interesting.</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/_Itano\"> /u/",
