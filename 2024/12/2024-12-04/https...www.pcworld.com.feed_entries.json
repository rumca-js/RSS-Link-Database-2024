After all, free versions are based on their paid counterparts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Good news is, when you see a free alternative to a paid version you like, you can safely assume the antivirus protection level is similar\u2014save for any specific malware types the free version doesn\u2019t cover.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To create this list of the top free antivirus programs, we looked at the top mainstream antivirus suites for Windows and selected the ones that offer a free version, as not all of them do.
