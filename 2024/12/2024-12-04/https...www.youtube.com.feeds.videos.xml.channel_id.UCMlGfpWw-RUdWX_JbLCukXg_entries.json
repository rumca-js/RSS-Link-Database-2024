This presentation delves into computing hashes for aggregated user-defined types and experimenting with various hash algorithms. We will explore the essentials of hash functions and their properties, techniques for hashing complex user-defined types, and customizing std::hash for specialized needs.  \n\nAdditionally, we (re)introduce a framework for experimenting with and benchmarking different hash algorithms. This will allow easy switching of hashing algorithms used by complex data structures, enabling easy comparisons. Hash algorithm designers can concentrate on designing better hash algorithms, with little worry about how these new algorithms can be incorporated into existing code. Type designers can create their hash support just once, without worrying about what hashing algorithm should be used.  \n\nYou will gain practical insights and t",
