So to clear things up, I wanted to attempt a brute-force method of hacking my way into the website. This is already what a lot of people are trying, just entering multiple different password combinations and guesses but instead of doing it manually, I&#39;ll just try it via a program. Nothing to do with hacking into the database, sensitive information, E-mails, etc. Just brute forcing my way into a password that the developer left hints for us specifically to find.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/EmoNation22\"> /u/EmoNation22 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r",

So they don&#39;t make pods with a QR code anymore either. This effectively means I can&#39;t use the coffee maker anymore, unless I somehow hack it to disable the QR check, or go with the physical approach just as the guy in the article below.</p> <p>This is an article explaining the issue and his workaround to it.
