The current scraping portion of the script works fine, but I need to modify it to include programmatic dual saving of the scraped data. I\u2019ve been scraping to JSON files so far, but dealing with millions of files is slow and inefficient to say the least. I want to add direct database saving while still at the same time saving and keeping JSON backups for redundancy. Since I need to rescrape one of the main sites soon due to new selector logic, this felt like the right time to scale and optimize for future updates.</p> <p>The project requires frequent rescraping (e.g., weekly) and the database will overwrite outdated data. The final data will be uploaded to a separate site that supports JSON or CSV imports. My server specs include 96 GB RAM and an 8-core CPU. My primary goals are relia",
