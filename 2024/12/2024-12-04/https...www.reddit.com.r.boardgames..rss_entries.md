I was replaying the same set over and over to get an strategic feel for the game. </p> <p>Watching the AI play i realized it was getting a lot of gold and them remodeling it to provinces.</p> <p>When i realized how fast that was i started playing around it and found a way to get ahead.

He bought multiple &quot;draw 2&quot; and trimmed his deck so heavily that when he drew a &quot;draw 2&quot; card one of the cards he drew was another such card. In effect he would draw his whole deck and be forced to reshuffle. When he did reshuffle he had to put his &quot;draw 2&quot; cards back in the deck, and then if he drew one of them again it created a loop. We weren&#39;t sure how to handle it. He went through half the map in one, neverending turn.</p> <p>Did we play this wrong?

Stuff like Warhammer 40k, Warmachine, etc. I actually think cloudspire is in this vein, despite it being sold as a Moba. It has the asymmetry, the interesting synergies between unit abilities, the customisable aspect where you have a lot of control over what sort of forces you are fielding. </p> <p>Another example that comes to mind is warcults. </p> <p>What else fits this type of game?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have a problem. I own over 100 games but it feels like we play the same 10-12 games every time we have a game night. We have tried randomizing our plays where the winner of a game rolls a dice and then we use a number generator where each of my games is assigned a random number, and whatever it lands on, it lands on. But it seems even then, it lands on the same games and a bunch don’t even come up.</p> <p>We’ve tried putting the games into tiers where we roll a D6 for the tier and a D20 for the game number. But that just doesn’t feel good.</p> <p>Does anyone have a good system for randomizing games so that the good stuff gets played but so does the other stuff you may not have played in a while?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Crafty_Machine_4502"> /u/Crafty_Machine_4502 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1h67ql1/randomize_board_game_plays/">[link]</a></span>

Something like &quot;You can use this resource differently&quot; or &quot;You start with these items instead of these items&quot;. These usually come in the form of a game &#39;faction&#39; or &#39;character&#39; that you choose during set up, but could also be varied player boards or ability cards etc.</p> <p>I&#39;m curious what games like these folks would recommend, as I&#39;m always on the look for more! Bonus points if they also have secret goals / end game scoring features!</p> <p>For reference, I&#39;m talking about game like;<br/> - Terraforming Mars<br/> - Dune: Imperium<br/> - Apiary<br/> - Caverna: Forgotten Folk</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Spaghetti_Cartwheels"> /u/Spaghetti_Cartwheels </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1h66yuz/games_with_unique
