<p>It may seem like players in the Fortnite community are always collectively up in arms about something--and that's because they pretty much always are. The object of this week's ire is the way that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-why-your-fortnite-xp-gains-are-slower-in-chapter-6/1100-6528184/">Epic Games has adjusted XP gains</a> in this newly launched Chapter 6, making progression through the Season 1 battle pass feel much slower than any Fortnite season has in years. Unsurprisingly, this has become the main topic of conversation in places like the Fortnite subreddit this week.</p><p dir="ltr">Epic has made two fundamental changes in how players will primarily earn XP, and these changes will prevent most players from being able to progress quickly through the new battle pass or OG Pass. With the way things are right now, getting through the battle pass is going to take longer than it did in the past. It's just a new fact of reality, though Epic has already soften

<p>Dancing is a fun way to show your personality and flair in Fortnite, but if you do it in certain locations with the game's newest update, you could pay a serious price. Fortnite's new Chapter 6, Season 1 update brings back "No Emoting" signs, and anyone who breaks the rule near the sign will get eliminated.</p><p>Fortnite had these signs in the game before, but previously they didn't do anything (<a href="https://www.thegamer.com/fortnites-no-emoting-signs-punish-kills-you-emoting/">via TheGamer</a>) and were part of mission objectives. As you can see in the video below, however, the rules have changed. Reddit user S4HAND whipped out their trombone and began to dance when they were catapulted off a cliff to their death. Remember, rules are rules!</p><p>This particular sign is located near Foxy Floodgates, and it's surrounded cones informing players they are entering a restricted space.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-adds-no-dancing-signs-with-deadly-consequ

<p dir="ltr">Citadelle des Morts is a new Zombies map arriving in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> on December 5, and Treyarch has released a short video to give players a behind-the-scenes look at the making of the French-inspired location. The video discusses the design choices and gives a better glimpse at the new Doppelghast enemy type.</p><p dir="ltr">Citadelle des Morts is a castle in France overrun with the undead. Treyarch says Zombies mode has plenty of maps "grounded in science fiction," and for this map, it wanted to lean more into magic. Citadelle des Morts also features elemental sword Wonder Weapons. This sounds similar to Black Ops 3's Der Eisendrache map, which was a snowy castle map with elemental bows. However, Treyarch says it has never featured a castle like Citadelle des Morts, as this new design lets players travel further into the claustrophobic bowels of the castle.</p><div data-embed-type="video"
