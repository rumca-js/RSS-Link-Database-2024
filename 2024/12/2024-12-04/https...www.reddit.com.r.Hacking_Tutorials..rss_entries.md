<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>We have an old clunky windows 10 computer. And it has username and admin. I found a small work around where you create a batch file it&#39;s like run as invoker or smtg like that. It works to force install some apps like t launcher worked and we played minecraft. But that doesn&#39;t work for all. I need to find a way to run as administrator for an installer or else It won&#39;t be good. Does anyone know any other work around to force install or get the admin and usernames. Thanks</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/EconomyPangolin4979"> /u/EconomyPangolin4979 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking_Tutorials/comments/1h6j0pn/bypass_admin_and_usernames/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking_Tutorials/comments/1h6j0pn/bypass_admin_and_usernames/">[comments]</a></span>
