        "description": "Learn how to Build a Stable Diffusion VAE From Scratch using Pytorch. VAE stands for Variational Autoencoder. It's a type of Autoencoder and a neural network that trains using an unsupervised technique. They are widely used in Image generation models mainly on latent diffusion-based and GANs-based image generation models.\n\nCourse created by @harshbhatt7585 \n\nColab notebook / code: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1OMq_-t3Co1pldn_hO6nHu4QDkxK2l2AL?usp=sharing\n\nArticled about the VAE and training code: https://plume-robin-b8f.notion.site/VAE-Explained-Implement-Train-1171a81fb77580e9b739dc9c2e5268c6\n\n\ud83c\udf89 Thanks to our Champion and Sponsor supporters:\n\ud83d\udc7e Drake Milly\n\ud83d\udc7e Ulises Moralez\n\ud83d\udc7e Goddard Tan\n\ud83d\udc7e David MG\n\ud83d\udc7e Matthew Springman\n\ud83d\udc7e Claudio\n\ud83d\udc7e Oscar R.\n\ud83d\udc7e jedi-or-sith\n\ud83d\udc7e Nattira Maneerat\n\ud83d\udc7e Justin Hual\n\n--\n\nLearn to code for free and get a developer job: https://www.freecodecamp.org\n\nRead hundreds of articles on programming: https://freecodecamp.org/news",
