<p>A lot of time is spent looking at the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3219792/best-antivirus-for-windows-pc.html">best paid antivirus suites</a>, but free antivirus solutions are worth discussion, too. After all, free versions are based on their paid counterparts.</p>



<p>Good news is, when you see a free alternative to a paid version you like, you can safely assume the antivirus protection level is similar—save for any specific malware types the free version doesn’t cover.</p>



<p>To create this list of the top free antivirus programs, we looked at the top mainstream antivirus suites for Windows and selected the ones that offer a free version, as not all of them do.

<p>Back in 2017, Samsung released the first showing of DeX (short for “desktop experience”) that allowed high-end Samsung Galaxy phones to plug into a special dock and be used like a desktop PC. In 2019, the dock was eliminated, and in 2020, wireless DeX came out — on Windows, Samsung DeX could be accessed via the DeX app.</p>



<p>But starting with One UI 7, the DeX app for Windows will no longer work; at that point, users are encouraged to switch over to Microsoft’s Phone Link app. One UI 7 is rumored to <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_planning_middecember_release_for_one_ui_7_beta_sources_claim-news-65513.php">enter beta testing in mid-December</a> and will likely start rolling out in the US early in 2025.</p>
