<p><a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2253770/what-is-python-powerful-intuitive-programming.html">Python</a> is a powerful programming language that is easy to learn and easy to work with, but it is not always the fastest to run—especially when you’re dealing with math or statistics. Third-party libraries like <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2336120/what-is-numpy-faster-array-and-matrix-math-in-python.html">NumPy</a>, which wrap C libraries, can improve the performance of some operations significantly, but sometimes you just need the <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2261151/why-the-c-programming-language-still-rules.html">raw speed and power of C</a> directly in Python

<p>Express.js is the most-used HTTP server and middleware platform for <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2254485/what-is-nodejs-javascript-runtime-explained.html">Node.js</a>. Let’s take a hands-on look at what it brings to the table.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="request-handling-with-express-js">Request handling with Express.js</h2>



<p>Handling requests over the Internet is one of the most frequent and common tasks in software development. An HTTP server like Express.js lets you define where requests come in, how they are parsed, and how a response is formulated.
