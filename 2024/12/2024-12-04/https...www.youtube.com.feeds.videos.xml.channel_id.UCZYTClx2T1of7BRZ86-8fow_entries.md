Over the past three decades, astronomers have discovered thousands of planets beyond our solar system. But while some of them might be the right size and mass to be some kind of Earth 2.0, we don't know if any of them is truly Earth-like. An upcoming technology, known as a starshade could provide a much clearer view of worlds lightyears away.
