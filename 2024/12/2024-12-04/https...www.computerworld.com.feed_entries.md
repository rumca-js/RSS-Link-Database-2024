<p>Automation in the past mainly affected industrial jobs in rural areas. GenAI, on the other hand, can be used for non-routine cognitive tasks, which is expected to affect more highly skil

<p>Apple has faced an unequal battle in recent years as some lawmakers, the FBI, and regulators insist that the company create backdoors through which to access messages and other parts of its platform.</p>



<p>Apple and others have always insisted that there is no such thing as a safe backdoor, and that if one person has access, then it’s only a matter of time until others gain access, too. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Use encryption for all your communications</strong></h2>



<p>Now, the FBI seems to agree.</p>



<p>In a recent security warning, the FBI and the US Infrastructure Security Agency have warned people to use encrypted apps such as iMessage and FaceTime for communi

<p>Mark Zuckerberg has consistently championed Meta’s Llama AI model as a leader in generative AI technology, positioning it as a strong competitor to OpenAI and Google. However, behind the scenes, Meta is complementing Llama with a rival AI model to meet its internal needs.</p>



<p>Meta’s internal AI-powered coding assistant, Metamate, uses both Meta’s Llama model and OpenAI’s GPT-4 to help developers and employees with coding tasks, <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/12/03/meta-openai-gpt-4-llama-coding-tool/?s=08">reported The Fortune</a>. The tool, which has been operational since early 2024, dynamically switches between the two models depending on the query, according to a current and a form

<p>When Microsoft announced Recall earlier this year, the move took the tech world by storm — and not in a good way.</p>



<p>Recall is supposed to help you find almost anything you see on your PC by taking screenshots in the background and turning your everyday Windows usage into a searchable database. Out of the gate, Microsoft made some <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2128281/microsoft-windows-recall-privacy.html">questionable privacy decisions</a>, and the company was unable to properly explain why we should actually trust Recall to collect and process so much sensitive info.</p>



<p>Now, many months later and after a variety of changes, the controversial Windows Recall featu

<p>Back in the 1990s, when Bill Clinton was president, people figured out they might just want to be on the internet, and Intel and Microsoft were the major technology powers. Between them, they owned the PC market and you’d have been laughed at if you told someone that “WinTel” would collapse like a house of cards in a hurricane.</p>



<p>Things have changed.</p>
