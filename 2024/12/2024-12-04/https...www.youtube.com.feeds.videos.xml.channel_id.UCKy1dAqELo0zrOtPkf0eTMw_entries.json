        "description": "Check out the trailer for the Banjo-Kazooie: Washer Banjo statue from First 4 Figures. The Washer Banjo is a resin collectible, and the sixth \"transformation\" statue to release in the Banjo Kazooie lineup. The trailer showcases the details of the Washer Banjo statue, including the Skull Plinth replica base, detailed backpack and hose, and more.\n\nFirst 4 Figure's Washer Banjo statue from Banjo-Kazooie is available now to pre-order. The estimated release date for the figure is Q3 2025.\n\nOne of the many transformations Banjo and Kazooie undergo in the original game is turning into a washing machine as a joke. The Washer Banjo transformation is a comedic moment during Mumbo Jumbo's spell, turning the duo into a washing machine with a playful request to clean his loincloth, swiftly followed by the correct transformation. However, completing all of Bottles' Bonus Challenges unlocks a cheat code, allowing gameplay as Washer Banjo.\n\n#IGN #Gaming",

And that includes the DCEU, a series that had its moments but never really found its footing as it tried to be the next MCU.\n\nBut that\u2019s where James Gunn comes in.
