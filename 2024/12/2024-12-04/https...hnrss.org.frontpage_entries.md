<p>Hello HN - I’m Tobi and I am building LimeJourney. LimeJourney is an open source customer engagement platform, a Customer.io /braze etc alternative.<p>- For the past few weeks I have been hacking on LimeJourney during my free time and I’m inviting you to check it out and give your feedback. You can try out the demo with email and password demo@limejourney.com/demo@limejourney.com<p>- My Grand thesis for building LimeJourney is that the channels through which we currently receive notifications will not be changing anytime soon but with the increase in data - now more than ever - businesses that will catch the attention of customers are the ones who in some shape or form are intelligently sending notifications(possibly with AI).<p>- LimeJourney in its current form is very far off from what I hope for it to be but still solves a couple of issues I experienced when working on another project. LimeJourney is relatively cheap($50) - single base plan compared to the other big guys in th

<p>We just launched Outerbase Studio, the open-source version of our core database offering. It works in your browser or as a desktop app and supports MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite.<p>What it does:<p>• Connects to MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite databases.
• Spin up local databases directly through the UI, even if you don’t have one running.
• Manage and query your data in a lightweight, intuitive interface.
• Completely open source.<p>Why we built it: 
We wanted to share the core Outerbase experience with the developer community as a free, open-source tool. It’s simple, fast, and removes the barriers to working with databases locally.<p>GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/outerbase/studio">https://github.com/outerbase/studio</a><p>Release Blog: <a href="https://www.outerbase.com/blog/outerbase-studio-open-source-database-management/">https://www.outerbase.com/blog/outerbase-studio-open-source-...</a><p>Try it out: studio.outerbase.com<p>Would love the HN communities feedback, please

<p>tldr:<p>I built Amurex, an open source Chrome extension for meeting transcription, real-time suggestions, and automated follow-ups.<p>I’ve tried every transcription and meeting tool out there, and none of them worked the way I needed. So, I built Amurex:<p>- No clunky bots joining or announcing themselves.<p>- Accurate, clean transcripts delivered right after the meeting.<p>- Auto-generated follow-ups that I can edit and send in seconds.<p>But most importantly, it is the only meeting copilot that does:<p>- Real-time suggestions during meetings to help me stay focused (or at least less miserable).<p>It’s also fully open source because I believe good tools shouldn’t be locked behind paywalls.<p>If you’ve ever struggled to stay engaged in meetings or needed quick, reliable transcripts and follow-ups. I’d love to hear what the community thinks!</p>

<p>Hi HN! I’m Sandy, and I’m excited to introduce Parsagon. Parsagon is using AI to automate workflows for government affairs professionals, starting with an AI search for public policy. Here's a demo: <a href="https://parsagon.io/explore-search">https://parsagon.io/explore-search</a><p>Current search portals for political monitoring are outdated. (By political monitoring, we mean people/orgs monitoring government announcements, policy updates, etc.; not the government monitoring people.) Each one only covers one region of the world, and they only allow you to search government publications based on simple keyword searches. Government affairs professionals often spend hours combing through noisy search results to find relevant developments. For example, they might search for the words “labor”, “employment”, “workforce”, etc., combing through all US government publications mentioning these keywords to find relevant material. Then they might have to repeat this process on separate pla

<p>VEKOS(Verified Experimental Kernel OS) is a Rust-based experimental kernel that focuses on runtime verification and security. Every filesystem operation and memory allocation generates cryptographic proofs that can be verified in real-time, ensuring system integrity. Think of it like a blockchain for OS operations rather than just storage verification.<p>Key features:
- Merkle tree-backed filesystem with operation verification
- Memory manager with CoW and proof generation
- Buddy allocator with zone-based memory management
- Shell with VT100 support
- Verified boot sequence with stage attestation<p>The kernel is still in alpha, but it demonstrates a novel approach to OS security by making verification a first-class citizen. All critical operations (memory allocations, filesystem writes, process creation) generate proofs that are stored in an append-only chain, similar to a blockchain but for system operations.<p>GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/JGiraldo29/vekos">https://githu

<p>Hey HN,<p>I am a student shipping apps in my free time. This is my 4th for the year!<p>Non-fic books and podcasts have been part of my life for years now but I always struggled with remembering what I’ve read or listened to. I wanted it to stick even after years.<p>My notes list grew large but I never really revisited them. That’s why I created GinkgoNotes.<p>You can enter notes you want to recall and leave it to the app to create a personalised (based on spaced repetition) email schedule. That means you’ll get your notes emailed to you a couple of times exactly when you should read them again (based on Ebbinghaus's Forgetting Curve) so it’s certain that you’ll remember them.<p>I hope this will be helpful as it was for me. Would love some feedback!<p>Iskren</p>

I ranked them based on its category relevancy and feature completeness.<p>Some technical details & features:<p>- fully static site built with Astro<p>- View Transition API for smooth navigation<p>- Instant/static search with Astro static endpoints<p>If you have an open source project that can be an alternative to popular software, let me know. I will list it on AlternateOSS for free :)<p>Thanks, have a nice day!</p>
