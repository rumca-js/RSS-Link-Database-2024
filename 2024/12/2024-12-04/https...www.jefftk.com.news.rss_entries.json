We generally use email for\nthis: it's very standard and works well enough.\n\n</span>\n\n<p>\n\nOne place where it doesn't work very well, though, is making it\npossible for others working on a project to read and find relevant\nthreads.  For example, if I write to our partner I can CC coworkers\nwho are currently on the project, but what if my boss is interested?\nWhat about other people who might join the project later?  What if I\nwant to share a link to the conversation with a co-worker?\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nMy preferred solution here is email lists.  For example, if I were at\nExampleCorp working on Project Cabbage with OtherCorp, I would create\na cabbage-other@example.com list and CC it on all my Cabbage-related\nmessages to OtherCorp.  If the Cabbage-Other collaboration isn't\nsensitive I might have the list set so anyone at ExampleCorp can join,\nor I might open it only to specifi",
