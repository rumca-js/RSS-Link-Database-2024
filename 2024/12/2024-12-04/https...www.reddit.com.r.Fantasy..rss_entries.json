I get the sentiment of avoiding needlessly putting yourself through something you\u2019re not enjoying, but some of us like engaging with the good and the bad of books and discussing what we liked and didn\u2019t like without having to sugar coat it or have a million caveats. It seems like everything that could be perceived as negative here gets dismissed as not being for everybody. Isn\u2019t the point of discussion boards to discuss everything about a topic, and to hash out disagreements/ issues people have with certain material? I know everybody might not be here for that, but it seems to be severely lacking. However I could just be missing those discussions so I\u2019m interested in others thoughts. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href",

Recently I\u2019ve been seeing a lot of the \u201cdark fantasy\u201d (it\u2019s actually not dark) slideshows on my social media and just wanted something that gave that same cozy, mystical ambience in book form. Something that makes me feel like I\u2019m entering a warm tavern is what I envision, ideally a standalone and not a super long series (though I\u2019m willing to start a series if it\u2019s really good). In summary, I\u2019m just a bit burnt out from reading academic articles and text books and want to read something comfortable and interesting in one of my favorite genres this winter.</p> <p>Bonus points if it has good romance! </p> <p>Thank you all so much for your help. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Happy_Jellyfish1",

For anyone wanting to read this book, having this: <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/darkstartril/comments/c86pah/black_leopard_red_wolf_reread_chapter_1/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/darkstartril/comments/c86pah/black_leopard_red_wolf_reread_chapter_1/</a> helps a lot with following the plot. </p> <p>That said, I found I absolutely loved reading this book.
