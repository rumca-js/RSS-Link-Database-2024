<p>As a smile spread slowly across his face, Mohamed Salah kissed the club crest adorning his rain sodden red shirt. The Egyptian’s ninth goal in seven Premier League games, and second on the night, had not merely reinforced Liverpool’s title challenge but strengthened the case for offering a forward who, right now, could probably walk unaided on the River Nile, a lucrative contract extension at Anfield.</p><p>Not that Salah was the only man improving his negotiating position as Fabian Schär’s late equaliser ensured one of the games of the season, if not the decade, ended with honours even as Arne Slot’s league leaders’ winning run was finally halted.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/dec/04/fabian-schar-stuns-liverpool-to-snatch-late-newcastle-equaliser-in-thriller">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From a Lego Pharrell Williams to a monkey Robbie Williams, modern biopics are reimagining lives to uncover deeper truths</p><p>Biographical films have long been favoured by Hollywood studios for their prestige while offering actors the kind of meaty roles that win audiences – and Oscars. This year’s<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/mar/12/oppenheimer-christoper-nolan-oscars-2024"> Oppenheimer</a> was no exception, winning in seven categories including best film, best director and best actor.
