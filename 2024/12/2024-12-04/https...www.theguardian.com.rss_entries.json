Here\u2019s what to watch tonight</p><p><strong>10pm, Channel 4</strong><strong><br></strong>Robyn Malcolm puts in the performance of the year in this emotionally knotty New Zealand drama, in which no-nonsense teacher Penny Wilding deals with the return of her husband, Phil (Peter Mullan), who, she says, she caught sexually assaulting a minor at a party five years earlier. In an incredible double-bill finale this week (the story concludes on Thursday), Penny is questioning everything she has believed until now, and has isolated herself from friends and family. Did she get it all wrong? Can there be a satisfying conclusion? Perhaps not, but at least by the end \u2013 at another party \u2013 we find out what really happened that night. <strong>Hollie Richardson</strong></p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/dec/04/tv-tonight-p",
