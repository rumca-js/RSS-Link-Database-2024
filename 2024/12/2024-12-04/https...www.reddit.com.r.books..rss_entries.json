Right now, I have 12 books that I have made various levels of progress in. I am interested in all of them, and want to finish them, but it&#39;s going to take a long time because I keep starting new ones. </p> <p>I have ADHD, and I feel like I have an issue of craving novelty, and get excited about a new book before I&#39;m done with everything else I&#39;m already reading. I usually only read one or two books a day--one fiction, one nonfiction. Switching it up like that seems to help, but I still struggle a lot to complete any book unless it&#39;s short. I probably have about another 10 books that are virtually abandoned because other ones have taken their place. </p> <p>How do you keep yourself interested in one book at a time and not open one book after another? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/StellaZaFella\"> ",

There was a point when I thought the book would get 5 stars from me...</p> <p>Then I learned that Christopher&#39;s mother cheated, and that&#39;s bad. (I know it&#39;s not so black-and-white, but even after finishing the book, I couldn&#39;t find the mother redeemable.) A few pages later we learn the mother is actually still alive and the father hid her letters. I might be able to see where he was coming from, but that&#39;s just plain wrong. And killing a dog because your neighbor loves the dog more than you? Unforgiveable.</p> <p>Yet it was obvious that the dad loved Christopher, so it was very frustrating to see him just shut his father out. And when Christopher ran away from home...I lost my sympathy towards him. (It was especially frustrating when he needed to catch a tube but was too terrified and kept missing them.",
