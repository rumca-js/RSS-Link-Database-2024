<p>A few nuggets of wisdom from Andy Grove, in an interview with Esquire in 2007:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Profits are the lifeblood of enterprise.</em> Don’t let anyone tell
you different.</p>

<p><em>You must understand your mistakes.</em> Study the hell out of them.
You’re not going to have the chance of making the same mistake
again — you can’t step into the river again at the same place and
the same time — but you will have the chance of making a similar
mistake.</p>

<p><em>Status is a very dangerous thing.</em> I’ve met too many people who
make it a point of pride that they never take money out of a cash
machine, people who are too good to have their own e-mail address,
because that’s for everybody else but not them. It’s hard to fight
the temptation to set yourself apart from the rest of the world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Grove, still serving as CEO during Intel’s zenith in 1997, didn’t even have an office. <a href="https://www.industryweek.com/leadership/companies-executive

<p>The Verge’s Sean Hollister penned an excellent high-level summary of how Pat Gelsinger wound up getting forced out of Intel, “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/3/24311594/intel-under-pat-gelsinger">What Happened to Intel?</a>”. A wee bit of pussyfooting here, though, caught my eye:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Just how bad was it before Gelsinger took the top job?</em></p>

<p>Not great! There were bad bets, multiple generations of delayed
chips, quality assurance issues, and then Apple decided to abandon
Intel in favor of its homegrown Arm-based chips — which turned
out to be good, seriously showing up Intel in the laptop
performance and battery life realms. We wrote all about it in
“<a href="https://www.theverge.com/22597713/intel-7nm-delay-summer-2020-apple-arm-switch-roadmap-gelsinger-ceo">The summer Intel fell behind</a>.”</p>

<p>Intel had earlier misses, too: the company long regretted its
decision <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/5/16/4337954/intel-could-have-
