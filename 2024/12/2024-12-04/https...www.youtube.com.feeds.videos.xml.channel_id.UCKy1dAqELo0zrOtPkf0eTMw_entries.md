Check out the trailer for the Banjo-Kazooie: Washer Banjo statue from First 4 Figures. The Washer Banjo is a resin collectible, and the sixth "transformation" statue to release in the Banjo Kazooie lineup. The trailer showcases the details of the Washer Banjo statue, including the Skull Plinth replica base, detailed backpack and hose, and more.

First 4 Figure's Washer Banjo statue from Banjo-Kazooie is available now to pre-order. The estimated release date for the figure is Q3 2025.

One of the many transformations Banjo and Kazooie undergo in the original game is turning into a washing machine as a joke. The Washer Banjo transformation is a comedic moment during Mumbo Jumbo's spell, turning the duo into a washing machine with a playful request to clean his loincloth, swiftly followed by the correct transformation. However, completing all of Bottles' Bonus Challenges unlocks a cheat code, allowing gameplay as Washer Banjo.

## Does Canon Even Matter Anymore? James Gunn Says 'None of It Is Real'

Hear what James Gunn has to say about canon! For better or worse, Hollywood is what it is today in large part thanks to the concept of the shared universe. And the shared universe style of storytelling, of course, rose to popularity because of the huge success of Marvel Studios over the past 15 years. In other words, because of canon.

The other studios famously – or is it infamously – tried to follow the shared universe trend, usually failing to replicate Marvel’s big wins. And that includes the DCEU, a series that had its moments but never really found its footing as it tried to be the next MCU.

But that’s where James Gunn comes in. As he launches his new DC Universe with Creature Commandos, and then the new 2025 Superman movie after that, he told us the following: "One of the weird things to me is none of this is real. It may be alarming to people, but none of it is real."
Basically, as far as James Gunn is concerned, canon has become way more important than it should be. And his

Check out this boss battle gameplay against Hexe Marie in Crimson Desert, the upcoming open-world third-person action-adventure game developed by Pearl Abyss.

Enraptured by the mesmerizing shadows, she dared to break forbidden taboos and infused darkness even into her own child. Many have tried to thwart her twisted ambitions, yet she remains within the sanctuary steeped in wrath and vile curses, awaiting the dawn of the false paradise."

## Elden Ring 2 Not Currently Being Considered at FromSoftware - IGN Daily Fix

In today's Daily Fix:
FromSoftware had a massive hit on its hands back in 2022 when they dropped Elden Ring. The game received near-universal acclaim and had the sales to back it up, being one of the best-selling games of that year. After releasing the well-reviewed expansion, Shadow of the Erdtree, it seems like a no-brainer that FromSoftware would start work on a sequel, but that may not be the case. President and Elden Ring director Hidetaka Miyazaki says that the company is not working on Elden Ring 2, but things could change in the future. In other news, several games are leaving Game Pass this month, including Rise of the Tomb Raider, Forza Horizon 4, and more. FYI, current Game Pass subscribers do get a discount if you want to own the games permanently. And finally, in entertainment news, Moana 2 had a massive 5-day holiday debut with an astounding $221 million in the U.S. alone. The sequel helped propel a massive movie theater comeback over the Thanksgiving Day weekend, with
