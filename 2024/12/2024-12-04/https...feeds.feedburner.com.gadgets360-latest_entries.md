New research suggests that dark matter may have originated from a "Dark Big Bang," a cosmic event distinct from the standard Big Bang. Proposed by scientists at Colgate University, the theory explores scenarios where dark matter could have been introduced into the universe up to a year after the initial Big Bang. Unlike regular matter, dark matter interacts only through gravity, making it elusive to detect. The study, published in Physical Review D, identifies gravitational waves as potential evidence for this theory, which could be detected by advanced experiments like the International Pulsar Timing Array. If confirmed, the "Dark Big Bang" could revolutionise our understanding of dark matter and its unique relationship with the rest of the universe
