<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>As the title suggests, I am looking for some nonfiction ‘adventure’, ‘quest’, or ‘journey’ style books that aren’t sad or depressing. </p> <p>I buy books for my grandpa who is in his 90’s and all he does is read as he doesn’t like/can’t hear the TV or radio. He likes books that “take him places” but are not fantasy/sci-fi. A lot of the books I have chosen for him he finds interesting but also depressing as half the people die or something tragic happens. </p> <p>He has read a lot of the books on Antarctic and South Pole adventures and sailing: Masons Will, Frozen in Time, Labyrinth of Ice, Icebound, Endurance, In the Heart of the Sea - just to name a few titles. </p> <p>Please let me know if you have any recommendations, I would really appreciate it!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/AcanthisittaOk5148"> /u/AcanthisittaOk5148 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/commen

It was a series of separate disjointed events that were creepy and entertaining in their own right but combined into chilling and really sad masterpiece by the end.</p> <p>Is there any other books that come to mind that use this kind of story telling, I like horror but I’d like to see if any other books are like this.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Silver-Bengal"> /u/Silver-Bengal </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1h6tyu1/books_where_each_chapter_its_own_story_but_still/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/book

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I used to read a lot as a teenager, and loved series like Eragon and Maximum Ride, but as I became an adult I tended to find myself more enthralled by worlds and stories portrayed in videogames rather than books; I still enjoy reading, but it was just easier to tell whether I would like a game than it was to tell whether I&#39;d like a book. This rift between the two types of media is only made larger by the fact that I&#39;m pretty particular about what I spend my time on; if I don&#39;t enjoy a game, I stop playing it, and if I don&#39;t enjoy a book, I stop reading it, I don&#39;t like the idea of investing time into something that doesn&#39;t satisfy me. Prime examples of worlds I loved in games are Persona &amp; Destiny - I <strong><em>adore</em></strong> the worlds and characters of such games, I treasure the ability to get completely swept along by a narrative, the more fantastic the better.</p> <p>In recent years I&#39;ve been trying really h

I just want to read about 2 people that can’t be together because of themselves, not because of their time period/location/social beliefs ect. And this is hard to find especially in queer novels since homophobia is a big problem in the real world and hence it is a big angst factor in the story, but I don’t want to read that right now. Right now I just want them to have problems because of their own problems, not the problems the world has. Don’t judge me for this, I ju

Both are delightful and often wintry, but not exactly what I&#39;m searching for here. Open to most genres: most of what I read is literary fiction with some sci-fi and fantasy thrown in.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I will be honest with you. I am almost 30 years old and I have realized that I have a big problem, and that is that I run away or abandon anything or any task that causes me the slightest feeling of discomfort,</p> <p>I want to learn to do many things, but to learn something I need to study and practice. The problem is that if while studying I encounter the slightest setback or difficulty learning something, I end up abandoning it and choose to do something non-productive like watching TV or just playing video games.</p> <p>The same thing happens to me with work. I have many ideas and plans for projects that I want to do, but when I think about the possibility that they will fail and one of my plans will be ruined, it makes me desperate that makes me end up abandoning the project before I even start it.</p> <p>I want to have a job, but because I&#39;m afraid of making a mistake and angering my boss or my client, I end up not applying for any job.</p>

I really loved the movies because of its lighthearted adventure and the characters, specifically Riley. I’d really love a book with fun, page-turning adventure and a fun group of friends! bonus points if it’s a series!! I’ve already read the Davinci code and I thought it was alright, but i’m looking for something a little less mature. Specifically a YA or romcom type, you know? Maybe a fantasy with a romance subplot would the best fit. Please leave your suggestions!

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I had listened to the audiobook version of Flowers for Algernon by Daniel Keyes few years ago. But when I read the book afterwards, I found out that there were certain details which would have been better if I had read the book instead of listening to it.<br/> While reading House of Leaves by Mark Danielewskyi I remember thinking that it would never make sense as an audiobook.<br/> On the other hand, I&#39;ve read Project Hail Mary by Andy Weir, but the audiobook experience was far superior than reading it. The same goes for Dungeon Crawler Carl by Matt Dinniman.</p> <p>So I&#39;m curious. Which books should not be listened to as audiobooks as it detracts certain aspects of the original book and which are the ones that are enhanced when experienced as audiobooks?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Mostly_Harmless_N42"> /u/Mostly_Harmless_N42 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksug

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello,</p> <p>I made the vow to myself to read a book, since I haven&#39;t in a long time, andI just finished the metamorphosis by Franz Kafka. It was very good. It made me feel frustrated and unsatisified for the main character. It took me a few weeks to get through the beginning of the book because I was busy and it seemed boring, but after page thirteen I read the rest of the book in one and half hours.</p> <p>This was the first book that I&#39;ve read to completion in maybe six years (Im 20M). The last book I read before this one was Midnight Thief by Livia Blackburn, and I&#39;ve read that maybe four times.</p> <p>I&#39;m looking to read my next book to read and I would like some recommendations to do so. I&#39;m not looking for any genre in specific, just something semi short, (more than 50 pages but less than 300) and interesting.</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/_Itano"> /u/
