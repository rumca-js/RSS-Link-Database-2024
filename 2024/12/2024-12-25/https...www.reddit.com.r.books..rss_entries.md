## I've determined that either Jim Qwilleran, Koko, or Yum Yum is an arsonist.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Lillian Jackson Braun wrote 29 mystery novels before she died. Basic trope: journalist James MacIntosh Qwilleran always seems to find himself involved with a murder. The perfect trope for a murder mystery series. I do see a problem, though. </p> <p>Every single place the guy lives, always seems to be destroyed by fire. In a series that spanned less than a decade, I believe he had at least 5 homes go up in smoke. Most fires were never &quot;solved&quot; so I think him or one of his cats was doing it. It didn&#39;t matter if it was an apartment he rented, an apartment that he owned, or an old apple barn he had converted into a home. By the time the apple barn home caught fire, I was ready to give up on the series. Too many fires. It was becoming a trope.</p> <p>Have you found any other authors that fell into a trope cycle? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Swiggy1957"> /u/Swiggy1957 </a> <br/> <span

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m reading Oliver ATM, and bloody hell, to the modern reader the writing style is arduous. The story itself is fantastic (there&#39;s a reason they his works are popular), but half a page exhaulting the reader, then another two or three paragraphs, describing how good looking a girl is. </p> <p>Are his other works similar? It&#39;s not that I&#39;m not enjoying the book, but it would be half the length without the waffle. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ratty_89"> /u/ratty_89 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hm31he/dickens_books_are_hard_work/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hm31he/dickens_books_are_hard_work/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello everyone.</p> <p>&lt;promotion alert&gt;</p> <p>For English language readers here, have you ever felt that it&#39;s a travesty that we don&#39;t get to read some of the best literature out there in the world, just because they are gatekept by another language? Sure, a few authors like Murakami, Han Kang, Olga Tokarczuk slip through the cracks and make it big in English, but they represent a very tiny minority. And even these get discovered like 10 years after being written in their original language.</p> <p>I&#39;ve been working with a friend on a project where we want to change this. And create a foreign books portal to access the world&#39;s best literature for the first time ever in English.</p> <p>If that&#39;s something you resonate with, or you&#39;re looking to pick up an interesting, exotic read, or just live another culture vicariously, please check us out and share your thoughts and recommendations: <a href="https://www.outlandia.medi

## The End of Loneliness touched me in a way no book ever has.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I just finished “The End of Loneliness” by Benedict Wells. Came across this on a book channel I follow. I haven’t found much on it other than a couple posts. From what I understand it was a hit in Germany. </p> <p>It’s a story that walks you through a man’s journey through life and loss. The writing was beautiful, I related with so much that was on the pages. A difficult but beautiful read. The first book I have given 5 stars in years. I would suggest this to almost everyone. I’m blown away I can’t find more discussion on it. Genuinely feel like this could end up as one of my favourite books. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/DaltonFitz"> /u/DaltonFitz </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hlumt2/the_end_of_loneliness_touched_me_in_a_way_no_book/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hlumt2/the_end_of_loneliness_touched_me_in_

## Returning to Harry Potter as an adult

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Harry Potter was my absolute favorite book series as a kid. Lately, I&#39;ve been listening to the audiobooks narrated by the incredible Stephen Fry. I have complicated feelings about it. It&#39;s very nostalgic, and the world feels just as vibrant and immersive as it did when I was younger. However, it feels tainted by JK Rowling&#39;s virulent transphobia. It&#39;s hard to separate the art from the artist given that she&#39;s using the fame and money from the franchise to take away rights from trans people. There&#39;s also some unsettling elements present- this is a book series in which someone&#39;s appearance is almost always reflective of their character. If someone is too fat, too skinny, too ugly, etc, they are guaranteed to be evil or at least an asshole. I think you can see reflected here an attitude of essentialism, and it&#39;s not hard to imagine how someone who thinks that way could believe that gender is determined by the sex you&#39;r

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m currently reading Dracula and it started off great. Johnathan in the castle was good but since leaving his pov the book has become a bit of a drag. </p> <p>I feel like this whole part of the book could have been like half the length it has been. I actually really liked the first part of Lucy and Mina&#39;s points of view in Whitby with Lucy&#39;s sleepwalking leading her up to the cliff at night and mina seeing the dark figure looming over her. It was a creepy image but I feel like it&#39;s stretching out Lucy&#39;s illness way too much. She&#39;s ill, she&#39;s gets a transfusion, she bounces back, she&#39;s ill again, another transfusion, she bounces back again, she&#39;s ill again, they put out garlic, she gets better, the mother takes the garlic away, she gets ill again, they put the garlic back and she gets better. etc etc. it&#39;s driving me nuts.</p> <p>I&#39;m not enjoying this part of the book and if it was a book that didn&#39;t ha

Is it insulting? A compliment?
