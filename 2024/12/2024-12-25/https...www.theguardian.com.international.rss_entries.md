<p>Bar some glitches, I think a tipping point has been reached – except when it comes to virtual gigs</p><p>I’m writing this from a room that’s slowly orbiting the Earth. Behind the floating screen in front of me, through a giant opening where a wall should be, the planet slowly spins, so close that it takes up most of my field of vision. It’s morning in Australia to my right; India and the first hints of Europe are dotted with lights up and to my left. The soft drone of the air circulation system hums quietly behind me.</p><p>I spent a week doing everything that I could – working, exercising, composing – on my <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/virtual-reality">virtual reality</a> headset.

## The birth of Jesus would probably have been forgotten – if it wasn’t for a plague | Jonathan Kennedy

<p>When a terrifying Ebola-like pandemic struck the Roman empire, Christianity offered solutions that the old ways didn’t</p><p>In our Christmas imagery, ancient symbols such as fir trees, mistletoe, holly and ivy sit alongside the baby Jesus, Virgin Mary, angels and shepherds. This mixture of pagan and Christian traditions reminds us that Christmas was superimposed on to much older midwinter festivities. Yet had it not been for a devastating pandemic that swept through the Roman empire in the third century AD, the birth of Jesus would probably not feature at all in our winter solstice celebrations.</p><p>If the New Testament is to be believed, Jesus managed to fit a great deal into his short life. But despite all his wise words, good deeds and miracles – not to mention the promise of everlasting life – Christ was nothing more than the leader of an obscure sect of Judaism when the Romans crucified him in AD33.</p><p>Jonathan Kennedy teaches politics and global health at Queen Mary Un

## Mikel Arteta: coach with ‘British DNA’ who learned from McLeish and Moyes

<p>Five years since the start of his Arsenal tenure, two of his former managers look at how his playing career shaped him</p><p>David Moyes wasn’t 100% sure when Mikel Arteta arrived at Everton. “He was a quiet boy and at the start we had to play him off the right of midfield,” he recalls. “I was thinking: ‘This is a young Spanish boy who might not be ready for the rigours of the Premier League and Goodison Park, for what is expected.’”</p><p>Alex McLeish sent his assistant Andy Watson to watch Arteta at Paris Saint-Germain when Rangers were considering signing him a few years earlier. “Different class, two good feet, quick enough, nimble,” Watson said. But there was a kicker. “He was never tested because PSG just rolled the ball out and it then took them 20 minutes to get to the halfway line!” It didn’t immediately scream “Scottish Premiership midfielder”, thought McLeish, picturing Aberdeen away on a wild, wet, winter’s afternoon.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2
