This is because every part needs to be dynamic and optimized for speed.</p> <p>So a few years ago I&#39;ve started to work on a web browser that intentionally doesn&#39;t implement JavaScript, instead it contains an updated set of scripts that fix and improve various websites.</p> <p>I&#39;ve been using this approach using a proxy server for a few years as my primary way of web browsing with good results. It uses a whitelist approach where no resources are loaded from different domains by default (the fix scripts can override it to load images from CDNs, etc.). This avoids any trackers by default.</p> <p>You can find more details on the homepage of the project:</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.fixbrowser.org/\">https://www",
