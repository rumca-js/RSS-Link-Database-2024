<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been noticing this for some time now, I thought I may have developed some problem with concentration but it cannot be a coincidence to happen so many times.</p> <p>I noticed that when I read a digital book, the size of the font and the way the text is wrapped around the screen makes a HUGE effect on my reading experience.</p> <p>For instance, if there is a lot of text in the screen, I&#39;m way more likely to get distracted with something else, or to keep concentration on the text whatsoever. My eyes even lose the position of the text from time to time, even. However, when the font is bigger, and the entire screen is taken by 20 - 25 lines of text only, even though it may seem more tiring to scroll more often, I feel like I flow with the text in a much easier way and my reading comprehension improves overall.</p> <p>Has anybody had a similar experience?

The unabashedly fed up with men and society‚Äôs sh*t feminist viewpoint, the incredibly dark humor and the young English voices were what i really enjoyed about the books. And while all of these had to do with murder that‚Äôs not necessarily a requirement.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Okay, this is an oddly specific request, but hear me out‚Ä¶ I tend to have quite a short attention span. I want to increase this by reading, and I notice that when chapters are short, I read more. I just started The Midnight Library on Kindle, and notice that the first 15 chapters all take less than 5 minutes to get through. Which motivates me to read another chapter. Then, when there was a longer chapter, I was invested and determined to keep reading. I also do this with physical books, flip through to see how many pages are left, and get motivated/demotivated by how much there is.</p> <p>I know it‚Äôs a bit of a weird brain hack, but it works for me. So does anyone know more books, where each chapter is relatively short? Or the first few chapters are, so I can get into the story? I tend to enjoy contemporary fiction, thrillers, biographies and sometimes historical fiction, if I am in the mood for that. I do not really care for fantasy or romance novels

Sad romance: Similar to You‚Äôve Reached Sam‚Äîa story where the FMC cherishes the memory of her lost MMC, possibly raising their children and fulfilling her late husband‚Äôs dreams or wishes. 3. Adoption-focused story: A book where: ‚Ä¢ A woman adopts a child and chooses not to get married. ‚Ä¢ Or a couple who struggles with infertility adopts a baby, told from the adoptive mother‚Äôs point of view, emphasizing that being a mother isn‚Äôt defined by giving birth but by love and care. </code></pre> <p>Would love to hear your suggestions for any of these!

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello! I‚Äôm looking for a relatively small fantasy book for my grandma. 1. It has to be simple. She is 85 and she has read, like, 7 books in her whole life . 2. It has to have a Greek translation. 3. It has to have a deeper meaning. (I was thinking of the Hobbit but I feel it might be too fantasy, i‚Äôm not sure, what do you think?) 4. No good dragons (St. George killed a dragon = dragon bad. But I was thinking of The Wizard of Earthsea)</p> <p>I was reading Dune and she asked so I started explaining very roughly and then reading her a bit and she loved it. Asked for something like this. Note: She liked the Baron Harkonnen because she too doesn‚Äôt like and wants to get rid of a family member that doesn‚Äôt respect her and her property. She didn‚Äôt mind (I think she liked) that there were female priests, the Bene Gesserit. Note 2: We are Cretan-Greek, for those that known what that means, so she loves a vendetta and getting back at those who wronged you. </p

I also never listen to audiobooks (prefer physical copies), and don&#39;t know where to start. He loves to listen to podcasts, though, and I thought giving him an easy way to dip his toes into audiobooks would be a fun surprise.</p> <p>He&#39;s all about non-fiction (gross). Politics (left-leaning), finance, statistics, business (especially start-ups and/or success stories--he loves the &quot;How I Built This&quot; podcast). He does like stories centering around life and people, too (lately he&#39;s really been into Dax Shepherd&#39;s Armchair Experts podcast, if that helps anyone). Prefer if it&#39;s available on Spotify, but I&#39;d consider Libby or Audible or whatever as well.</p> <p>I know this is a bit vague, but since narrator can make a big difference and I don&#39;t want to give him a poor first experience, I figured
