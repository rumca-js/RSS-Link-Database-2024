<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Heya.</p> <p>18m gay/ace.</p> <p>I’ve struggled with my mental health all my life, but this year horrifically. I’ve had struggles eating because of severe anxiety and phobias, lost a lot of weight, my friends left for uni while I stayed home. </p> <p>Today I did a big thing. I ate a meal in a place that wasn’t in my house.</p> <p>Maybe that sounds pathetic, or sad, but my reality has been so limiting because of crippling anxiety. I started therapy and just spend the days so angry and ashamed and tired.</p> <p>But today, on Christmas, I ate Christmas dinner at my step mum’s house.</p> <p>I had to go home early because I’m autistic and got too overwhelmed, which is embarrassing, but I’m still proud of myself.</p> <p>My therapist wants me to count my victories, because up until this point I constantly compared myself to others and beat myself up- which I still do, but I’m trying.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.red

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I recently made a post about how being NB vs a woman and NB on Bumble garnered very different results. Which I&#39;m honestly not shocked about, but I was just taken aback by how large the difference was. But then people started being lowkey transphobic in my comments so I just felt icky tbh.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I recently made the conclusion of being a man. I never felt gender dysphoria, LOVE girly things, and love being a woman. I love that I get to cry and be emotional. I love that I can fantasize about being a princess and wear pretty things, do my hair, put on makeup. I love that I get to be excited for things. I&#39;m a man but I was raised a woman. And I love myself. I&#39;m scared that as time goes by and being a man becomes more and more a part of my life that I&#39;d be scared of being me due to my sexist views(you have them too don&#39;t judge me) and others. And PLEASE don&#39;t assume I&#39;m under the nonbinary umbrella. I&#39;ve been thinking about this since I was 11. For the longest time I thought I wasn&#39;t a man and that caused way too much confusion and suffering. You can be a man and still fantasize about being a princess.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>As title says, my child who is 20 just came out as trans, I am supportive and all I want is for them to be happy and confident. </p> <p>How do we approach the subject when they are ready? And what questions should be asked with being sensitive and respectful to them? How do we help them? And how do we impart the wisdom of the world so to speak and prepare them to deal with those in the world who have issues with them? Especially now since so many have issues with trans people, in this case child would be MtF. </p> <p>Sorry I am trying to be clear but kind of scatter brained. We (husband and I) have long suspected they were part of the LGBTQ community. Just want help navigating this for them. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Relevant-Current-870"> /u/Relevant-Current-870 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/1hluzef/child_just_came_out_as_trans/">[link]</a></span> &#32;
