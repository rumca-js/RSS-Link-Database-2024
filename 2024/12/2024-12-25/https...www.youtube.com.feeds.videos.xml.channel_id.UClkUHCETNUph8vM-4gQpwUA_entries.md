Path of Exile 2 Monk Starter Guide - How to Build a Monk
In this Path of Exile 2 video, I'm going to be discussing how to play the Monk class. This video is designed for new monks out there. How to get off to the start with the Monk class. Explaining some of the basic mechanics of how to play. It is not an advanced build guide that's meant for end game or cool difficulty or anything like that.
