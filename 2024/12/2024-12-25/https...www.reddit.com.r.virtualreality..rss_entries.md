Ive had the Quest ever since and now im considering purchasing the PSVR2 really mainly just for better graphics despite that annoying earpiece issue everyone keeps complaining about.

I just let it sit there. A bit later, black screen, not like on but nothing showing, but completley off. I gave it more time, didnt power back on automatically. Tried to power on the normal way, didnt work. I went to boot menu and tried to boot it from there, went to some weird downloading thing, when done went to oculus boot screen for a while, the. just completley off again. Did it again, exact same thing. I now turned it on to the boot menu and went to device info, then it just black screened. I plugged it in, and no yellow light, it should have a good amount of charge left though.

Every weapon feels great.</p> <p><strong>Switchback</strong> - Surprisingly good. The whole ride you can it feels like metal passing under your hands like you&#39;re holding the metal rail.</p> <p><strong>Gun Club VR</strong> - This is pretty good for all around weapons too. The silenced pistol feels especially good and makes me hyped for Hitman 3.</p> <p><strong>GT7</strong> - I like how you can feel the &quot;clunk&quot; of the transmission shift gears in the controllers.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey all,</p> <p>so, for years I had the HP Reverb G2 headset as I was unhappy with the low resolution of my first headset (Rift DK1) which killed the immersion, especially on games such as Elite Dangerous.</p> <p>The resolution on the G2 is pretty amazing but takes its toll on the hardware. In Elite, at full resolution, max details and FSR on, it was only okay in black space. On a planet and especially inside the starbase on the landing pad it lagged too much: pilot menus opening slower, Escape menu opening significantly slower, the view dragged somewhat behind when turning your head. Pretty much unplayable with such settings! Hence I kept the resolution or lowered it to 50% in Steam. Still it could lag during Thargoid invasions on planets. This was on an RTX 4070 and an i7-8700k, GPU always showed 100% in Windows (CPU was fine).</p> <p>I know the 4070 is not really a 4k card but I didn&#39;t want to spend more 1xxx Euro on a single GPU!

## [Quest 3 / PCVR] I have slow home Wifi router that likely is not a good option for VR, however my motherboard on my PC has built in antennas and the spec sheet notes that its Wi-Fi 6E. Is there a way I can make my PC be a hotspot and connect my Quest directly this way for better results?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all. So I don&#39;t have Quest 3 yet but planning on getting one, but have been reading about ways to connect it to PC for best results in meantime.</p> <p>I often see it mentioned that Wifi speed is very important with Wifi 6E being the best option there is. Problem on my end is however that my home router is on slow end so I understand that I would likely need a better router for reasonable wireless play in my situation.</p> <p>However what I just noticed reading my motherboards spec sheet - MSI Pro B760-P Wifi DDR4 - is that it has this this noted next to its wireless connection section:</p> <pre><code>Intel® Wi-Fi 6E The Wireless module is pre-installed in the M.2 (Key-E) slot Supports MU-MIMO TX/RX, 2.4GHz / 5GHz / 6GHz* (160MHz) up to 2.4Gbps Supports 802.11 a/ b/ g/ n/ ac/ ax </code></pre> <p><a href="https://www.msi.com/Motherboard/PRO-B760-P-WIFI-DDR4/Specification">https://www.msi.com/Motherboard/PRO-B760-P-WIFI-DDR4/Specification</a></p

After that, downloading the software required to use the headset, including the SteamVR driver, won’t be possible. This effectively signals the end of the road for the G2.</p> <h1>Why Was the Reverb G2 Discontinued?</h1> <p>Here’s a quick rundown of what likely led to this decision:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Market Shift</strong>: Standalone VR headsets like the Meta Quest series have taken over, leaving PC-tethered VR systems behind.</li> <li><strong>Decline of WMR</strong>: Microsoft is moving away from supporting WMR, the platform that powered the G2.</li> <li><strong>Ecosystem Challenges</strong>: WMR never gained the traction that competitors like SteamVR or Oculus achieved.</li> <li><strong>Recent Issues</strong>:
