There is also small tutorial in the Readme for users new to Newsboat.</p> <p>Cheers</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/exaroth"> /u/exaroth </a> <br/> <sp

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been using CommaFeed and recently installed Feedly free version to see if I might want to switch to their paid AI version. I exported the CommaFeed OPML file and imported it to Feedly so they&#39;re identical.</p> <p>Why would the number of feeds be so different between the two? I seem to have more feeds sooner in CommaFeed than in Feedly.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/tomhusband"> /u/tomhusband </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1hlymfs/commafeed_and_feedly_have_a_different_number_of/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1hlymfs/commafeed_and_feedly_have_a_different_number_of/">[comments]</a></span>
