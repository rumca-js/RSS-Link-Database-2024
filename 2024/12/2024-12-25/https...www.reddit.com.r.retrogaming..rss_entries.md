I’d like to get one but now that I’ve shown the tiniest bit of interest in one console, I’ve been bombarded with ads for all the others and can’t really figure on which one might be best. I think the first one I saw was All8bit, which although more expensive than most of them seems to have the best list of games you can see/search pre-purchase. Also seems to be the most expensive at 159 with 4 controllers. It does say it has one of the really hard to find games (and probably the only reason I got semi-excited about getting one in the first place) Aerobiz and Aerobiz Supersonic which are the ultimate in lame as far as a reason to spend $160 but…I guess we’re all in a retro gaming forum so, whatever. There’s another one that looks like a cassette tape that supposedly links to “any” controlle
