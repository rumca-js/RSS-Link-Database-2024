<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I know that Google keeps copies of everything that&#39;s done through it&#39;s websites and other info but what happens when you edit the content? Does it rewrite over the previous copies or just makes a new copy of the edit and stores that effectively storing all the edit logs? Contents like images, notes, docs, etc</p> <p>And uh another question, what are the odds that the personal info of a random Jake is being read? Like Jake&#39;s emails, his photos etc? The population of Google users is kinda huge so I&#39;d assume that not everyone&#39;s data is being read into?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Icy-Mastodon5222"> /u/Icy-Mastodon5222 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/degoogle/comments/1hm22nu/privacy_concerns_for_the_data_copies_already_on/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/degoogle/comments/1hm22nu/privacy_concerns_for_the_data_copies_alrea
