<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am trying to build my own RISC V based CPU for learning purpose. I am an electronics grad and well versed in Verilog and SV, also have in depth knowledge of VLSI flow. What book or online courses should I start with to develop my own RISC CPU? I looked through some of the books and found two of them commonly mentioned on the internet: computer architecture by Hennessy and Patterson, computer organization by Hennessy and Patterson. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/No_Leg5189"> /u/No_Leg5189 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1hm7d3q/i_want_to_build_my_own_riscv_based_cpu_where_to/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1hm7d3q/i_want_to_build_my_own_riscv_based_cpu_where_to/">[comments]</a></span>
