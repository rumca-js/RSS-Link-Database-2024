## Adding sweetener to coffee enhances ‘night-owl’ effects of caffeine. Mice that had consumed caffeine-sweetener mix experienced a very long “free-running” sleep-wake period of 26-30 hours, and some even switched from a nocturnal circadian rhythm to daytime-based one, even when in persistent darkness.
