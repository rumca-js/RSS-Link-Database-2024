IIt's the first ever episode of the GMG Indie Hour. This series focuses on games you may have never even heard of and gives us an inside look at the wider world of independantly published Tabletop Wargames of all genres!

It's time for the GMG Indie Hour! Today you Indie Game sloppers have decided to get to the ROOT of the issue and have chosen Maxwzz FitzGerald's TURNIP28. To go with this delightful starchy selection I have paired it with the sentient ant-eater infested THIS QUAR'S WAR... now with adorable models from Wargames Atlantic.
