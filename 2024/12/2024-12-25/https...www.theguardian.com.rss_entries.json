My sincere and heartfelt thanks to everyone who\u2019s read the newsletter this year, and to all our new subscribers. Writing this newsletter and reading your correspondence remains my favourite part of my job. It means a lot that so many of you have written in to say that you look forward to Pushing Buttons landing in your inbox every week.</p><p>Thank you also to the Guardian\u2019s brilliant newsletter team, who have worked hard all year to get these missives to you on time even when I\u2019ve submitted them horribly late. (I\u2019m sorry, team. Relatedly: if games publishers could stop dropping huge news right around my deadline in 2025, that would be amazing.)</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2024/dec/25/pushing-buttons-reader-games-of-the-year\">Continue reading...</a>",
