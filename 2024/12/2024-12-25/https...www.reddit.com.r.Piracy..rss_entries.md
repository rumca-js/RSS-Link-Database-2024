<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Greetings everyone!!</p> <p>I got a blu-ray burner for Christmas and I thought I&#39;d use it to burn a disc of a movie I already own. One thing I was curious about was if there was a way to add special features to a blu-ray disc to burn (like making of features, deleted scenes, music videos, ect.). I know of programs like DVDFab and CyberLink to burn the movies to the disc, but will they also have ways to add the bonus content to the disc under a different menu, and how would I go about that? And advice would be helpful!</p> <p>Merry Christmas!!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/JustinThatGamerDude"> /u/JustinThatGamerDude </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1hm3d74/bluray_burning_question_concerning_special/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1hm3d74/bluray_burning_question_concerning_special/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I want to share large files with personal friends. I use Tailscale on my laptop, but Taildrop always fails (and is <em>very</em> slow) for large files (anything over ~50MB). Google Drive does not work, because the download always gets interrupted halfway through the download. IDM works great, but the trial expired. JDownloader has not been updated in years, so it likely is not safe.</p> <p>I was thinking, why not just use a torrent. But I need a tracker for that. I googled and found out about this site:</p> <p><a href="https://privtracker.com/">https://privtracker.com/</a></p> <p>The git page has not been updated since ~May 2023, but I&#39;m not sure that matters with this type of service. Would this work for transferring files between friends? Or if not, is there something else that works the same or even better? Btw, I’m using Windows 11 Pro on a laptop and the other computer is Windows 10 Pro, I believe. Thank you.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; s
