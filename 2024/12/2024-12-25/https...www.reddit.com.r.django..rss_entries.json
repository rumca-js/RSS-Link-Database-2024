Throughout the book, I often found myself asking questions like, how do CBVs and GCBVs work? Why do they inherit from the <code>View</code> class? Why is <code>.as_view()</code> used with CBVs and GCBVs, but not with FBVs?</p> <p>These questions stayed in my mind, so I decided to explore the Django repository to understand them better. While most of the code (if not all) went over my head, I believe I now partially &quot;understand&quot; the &quot;why&quot; behind some of these concepts.</p> <p>From my exploration, I realized that <code>as_view()</code> essentially \u201cconverts\u201d CBVs and GCBVs into functions because the foundational way of building Django views are FBVs.

I&#39;ve never worked with Django before, but I do know Python pretty well since it\u2019s my go to language for LC. My current plan is to start with the official Django tutorial, move on to Django REST doc, and then build a small project to get some hands on experience.</p> <p>For those who know both Spring and Django, is there anything I should keep in mind while learning Django? (I also have some experience with nodeJs Express, though that was from some personal projects I worked on a long time ago) Also, is the official Django doc the best way to learn, or are there other resources you\u2019d recommend? Would love to hear any advice or tips from people who\u2019ve been in a similar boat. Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Sad-Sympathy-2",
