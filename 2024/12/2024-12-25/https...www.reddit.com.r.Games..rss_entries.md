<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>While 2024 wasn’t exactly a banger year for gaming, it still managed to deliver a mix of hidden gems and absolute stinkers. Let’s focus on the latter. Remember, reviews are subjective—if you enjoyed any of these games, good on you! But let’s not kid ourselves—some of these titles were just downright <em>bad</em>.</p> <p>Here’s a breakdown of the year’s biggest disappointments, ranked by IGN’s review scale.</p> <h1>Category Five: Mediocre (Score: 5)</h1> <p>The “meh” tier. These games weren’t awful, but they weren’t memorable either. IGN calls them “bland, unremarkable games we’ve mostly forgotten about a day after playing.” Highlights—or lowlights—include:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Slitterhead</strong>: Absurd action-horror with parasitic monsters that somehow ended up boring.</li> <li><strong>Terminator: Dark Fate - Defiance</strong>: A Terminator RTS that failed to bring the excitement of battling Skynet.</li> <li><strong>The First Descendant</strong>:

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’ll start by saying I’m not a hardcore gamer. I don’t follow many game releases, and when I heard about this new Indiana Jones game from a friend, I hadn’t watched an Indiana Jones movie in years!</p> <p>After thinking about it for days, I decided to get a Game Pass subscription just to try it out. 2024 has been a year where I played a wide variety of games from different years and platforms—definitely one I’ll remember. Some highlights include <em>Demon’s Souls Remake</em>, <em>Code Vein</em>, <em>We Happy Few</em>, <em>Zelda: A Link Between Worlds</em>, <em>Uncharted 3</em>, <em>Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory</em>, and <em>Assassin’s Creed: Origins</em> (though I started Origins in late 2022, it took me nearly two years to finish it, including the DLCs).</p> <p>When I watched some reviews of the new <em>Indiana Jones</em> game, I couldn’t really figure out what its main genre was, and it took many hours of gameplay to truly understand it.</p> <p>I st

## What older games continue to receive updates or have gotten support/updates for an extended period?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>With all the sales going on, I thought it would be interesting to have some talk about older titles that:</p> <ul> <li>Are still getting updates to this day.</li> <li>Or, <em>were</em> getting updated for an extended period, especially beyond one would expect for them to receive.</li> </ul> <p>I hope this isn&#39;t <em>too</em> broad of a guideline to go by. With how much is out there, what is &quot;older&quot; is open to interpretation so it&#39;s probably too much of a hassle to narrow things down. AAA or indie, formerly popular or obscure, anything goes as long as it&#39;s by the developers.</p> <p>One example to start things off:</p> <p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/606710/Sphinx_and_the_Cursed_Mummy/">Sphinx and the Cursed Mummy</a> - Initially released on consoles back in the 2000&#39;s, it launched on Steam in 2017 and... <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/606710">was actually getting updates here and there in the f
