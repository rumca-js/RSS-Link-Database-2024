<p>This final farewell to the hugely loved sitcom is profoundly bittersweet. Alongside the laughs, it’s a beautiful, poignant piece of television</p><p>I’m not crying, you’re crying. OK, fine – I’m bawling my eyes out. And not just because it’s time to say a final farewell to Gavin, Stacey and the rest of the Barry and Billericay contingents – but because their swansong is a beautiful, extraordinarily poignant bonanza of nostalgia, love and (eventually) wish-fulfilment. If these characters don’t already have a place in your heart, this emotional 90-minute goodbye probably won’t change that. But if they do, prepare to be forcibly moved to tears.</p><p>British comedy has long relied on the Christmas special: our greatest sitcoms tend to bow out at their peak, but the festive revival traditionally comes to the rescue, extending the lifespans of iconic shows such as The Royle Family and Only Fools and Horses by a decade or more.

<p>Feathers McGraw is back – and more menacing than ever. Our claymation heroes’ delightful attempt to face him is hilariously packed with jokes – they’re just incapable of bad television</p><p>For many, the highlight of the entire Christmas schedule will have been a treat rare enough to savour: a new Wallace &amp; Gromit. Thirty-five years after their charmingly slapdash debut, A Grand Day Out, the claymation duo are the closest thing this country has to Mickey Mouse – beloved, instantly recognisable icons that make us yearn for a golden time in our history that never actually existed.</p><p>Part of the claymation duo’s charm is how sparingly they’re deployed. Since A Grand Day Out, they have only appeared on screen for about three hours, half of which came in the form of the feature film (terrifyingly, nearly 20 years old) The Curse of the Were-Rabbit. So a new outing, make no mistake, is an extremely big deal.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/dec/25/walla

When that happens, a democratic milestone in British parliamentary history will unquestionably have been reached. But a milestone along a road to what eventual constitutional destination?

<p>Joe and Evanna Giardina treasure memories of the affectionate 16-year-old they dubbed the ‘love machine’, who died in the 2004 disaster</p><p>At first, there seemed nothing to be afraid of. Joe Giardina, his wife, Evanna, and their 16-year-old son, Paul, were taking in the picture-perfect waters of Patong bay as they ate breakfast in their Phuket beachfront hotel on Boxing Day morning in 2004.</p><p>“We were admiring the view and all of a sudden the water disappeared,” says Giardina, 67, speaking from his home in Rosanna, Victoria. The water level had dropped so quickly that fish were floundering on the exposed seabed. But rather than sensing any threat, curious onlookers made their way to the beach. “The locals thought, ‘This is fantastic.’ They were running around picking the fish up.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/26/you-learn-to-live-with-the-pain-20-years-after-the-boxing-day-tsunami-australian-couple-remember-son-paul">Continue reading...</a>

Hours earlier, Bashar al-Assad <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/16/un-envoy-calls-for-inclusive-transition-syria-rebel-leader">had fled Damascus for Moscow</a>, ending a dictatorship that had ruled for more than 50 years.

This is a pretty trad music biopic, coming with the accepted U-shaped narrative arc of humble beginnings, big break, superstardom, drugs, drink, shallow sex, dark-night-of-the-soul slump and redemptive comeback, here topped off with an unendurably protracted performance of My Way at the Royal Albert Hall in London. But the whole thing is given a cheeky high-concept twist by portraying the singer as an ape – a shrieking, scowling, capering CGI chimp – while all around are humans. Actor Jonno Davies plays the part in motion capture and Williams himself supplies the voiceover.</p><p>The idea supposedly comes from Williams’s fear that he is immature and unevolved, stranded emotionally for ever at the age he became famous: 15. And this chimp figure runs counter to his 2001 song Better Man, with its

<p>Indeterminate sentences were scrapped in 2012 – but thousands of prisoners are still serving them, often for petty crimes, with no hope of release. Could there now be hope of resentencing?</p><p>Tony Woodley is raging at the injustice of it all. Enough is enough, says the Labour peer who has introduced a private member’s bill to resentence prisoners still serving time under imprisonment for public protection (IPP), which was abolished 12 years ago because it was regarded as an affront to decency. Although the sentence was banned, it wasn’t done so retrospectively, which means that almost 3,000 IPP prisoners are still inside, mostly for minor crimes, not knowing when, or if, they will ever be released.</p><p>IPP is so horrific, Woodley says, that often people don’t believe him when he tells them about it. “If you said to somebody: ‘You’ve got 16 years in jail for stealing a plant pot’, they’d say: ‘You’re the bloody plant pot for saying that!’ People wouldn’t believe or didn’t want

<p>The writers, philosophers and politicians who have raided Milton’s epic poem for inspiration</p><p>In 1818 Mary Shelley published Frankenstein, the story of a man who trespasses on God’s turf by crafting a new form of life. She took its epigraph from Book X of John Milton’s Paradise Lost, when Adam rages at God like a teenager who didn’t ask to be born. Shelley returned to Milton for 1826’s The Last Man, a grim, grief-sodden read about an annihilating pandemic: “Let no man seek / Henceforth to be foretold what shall befall / Him or his children.” One novel describes the creation of life, the other its destruction, and both open with Paradise Lost.</p><p>It is no surprise that Milton’s epic figured in the genesis of science fiction. Orlando Reade suggests that it “might be the most influential poem in English”, frequently stripped for parts. In relatively recent years, it has furnished the titles of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/philippullman">Philip Pullman</a>’s His

<p>Nicholas Hoult plays a wannabe far-right martyr, and Law and Tye Sheridan the feds on his tail, in a well-cast if anticlimactic true-crime tale</p><p>Justin Kurzel directs a workmanlike true-crime thriller about a real-life American white supremacist movement called the Order, which, in the 1980s, murdered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Berg">Jewish radio journalist Alan Berg</a> and pulled off bank robberies to fund a planned national insurrection. Its leader, Bob Mathews, sought a creepy martyrdom involving an Alamo-style standoff with federal agents at the group’s remote farmhouse in Washington state. Screenwriter Zach Baylin (Oscar-nominated for King Richard) adapts the book about the case, The Silent Brotherhood, by Kevin Flynn and Gary Gerhardt; Nicholas Hoult plays the baby-faced Mathews, with Jude Law and Tye Sheridan as the (fictional-composite) officers battling to take him down.</p><p>Kurzel contrives a solid, vehement film, with Law and Hoult proving to be

My favourite place to read, though, has always been the red tiled steps that lead to the front door of my nonna’s house in Puglia. There are photos of me and my cousins on those steps at every age.
