<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>i just finished reading the first book in this series- the grace of kings and I‚Äôm already raving about it. Why does no one ever mention or hype up this series?? the plot and character work was so rich. I‚Äôve never read a fantasy series with as much political intrigue as this book. It captures the fickleness and nuance of human nature so well. The desire for power and making something of yourself is such a crucial theme in this book. The mythology and the religion is soo interesting. It also has such a nice flowery metaphor weaved throughout (obvious in the name). I‚Äôm on the second book now and it‚Äôs literally just getting better. The female characters are also so well handled considering its based in ancient china. The world building is absolutely insane and every single corner of the world is well explained. Anyways yall I promise I‚Äôm not glazing this series for no reason it‚Äôs seriously so good!! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a h

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>For the last three weeks I&#39;ve been reading through the Dragonbone chair and I have to say, I had a hard time. I actually liked the slow beginning in the city but felt the book draged in the middle part, where Simon and binabik are walking through the lands. I didn&#39;t want to dnf the book, so I kept reading, although being not really interested, but was set on not continuing the series. Now my problem is, that i liked the last maybe 150 pages of the book alot more since it picked up the pace and now I really want to know how the st√∂rt continues. So now my question is, should I continue with book two or start reading something else? Is book two more of the middle part of the book or more of the, in my opinion, Story relevant last part of book one? </p> <p>P.s. om not opposed to slow pacing. I loved the farseer trilogy and lotr for example. Just didn&#39;t vibe with the lands and people in dragonbone chair.</p> <p>Thanks and merry Christmas!</p>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi, I&#39;m looking for a story I can&#39;t remember much about. It might be a specific chapter from a book or something similar. I recall there was a character locked in a prison, and there was a magical being that lived in a plant (I think it was a flower) in the cell. I can&#39;t remember if it sacrificed itself to help the character survive or for another reason, but it dies, and then the character takes the flower with them when they manage to escape.</p> <p>I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs from a Cosmere book or The Farseer Trilogy‚Äîthese seem like the most likely options, but it could be something else.</p> <p>I would apreciate if someone remembers the character and the fully situation.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Aarnaiz99"> /u/Aarnaiz99 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1hlpvhi/trying_to_find_a_book/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/
