## Why is arch the most used distro when looking at Linux Gaming statistics? Is it only because of the Steam Deck, or is it true if we look at only desktops/laptops?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>The reason why I&#39;m asking this, is because I, a person who likes things easier would think people would go easy on themselves and choose a distro that is easier to maintain like Ubuntu, Mint or Fedora or hell, even Opensuse TW. So why is arch &quot;the most used&quot;? Btw, just because I like things easier I don&#39;t think Arch is &quot;hard&quot; to use, I just think most people would choose something simpler to use.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Szhadji"> /u/Szhadji </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1hmb3yv/why_is_arch_the_most_used_distro_when_looking_at/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1hmb3yv/why_is_arch_the_most_used_distro_when_looking_at/">[comments]</a></span>

I am thinking of Bazzite since it seems like the most &#39;it just works&#39; distro as of now (I have no problem with tinkering and such, but I want something that is reliable, hard to mess up, and works most of the time). However, I have some questions:</p> <ol> <li><p>I do a lot of programming and game development. I can install Godot through Steam, but I don’t think there is a Flatpak for the Rust compiler. Does anyone have any experience with development on Bazzite?</p></li> <li><p>Has Wayland and Nvidia truly become as good as I have heard? I tried Fedora last year, and it mostly worked. I could not use Wayland at all, but X11 worked decently. I still had some issues, which is why I switched back to Windows. I have heard that Nvidia on Wayland is no longer a problem. Is this true?</

In 2.4GHz mode, touching the right trigger starts moving my cursor up, holding it down moves it down, but letting go makes it go up again. in Bluetooth mode, the left stick controls the cursor, and touching the left trigger this time makes it do the same thing that the right trigger did in 2.4GHz mode, and some buttons act as clicks. This started happening after going to windows and updating the firmware, so that should be up-to-date. Also, running the &quot;xinput disable &lt;id&gt;&quot; command makes these issues go away, but after restarting the controller, the problems arise again. Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p> <p>Edit: My Xbox one controller now does the same thing, it wasn&#39;t like this before.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Akos364"> /u/Akos364 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit

I have even tried the other package that adds udev rules, its called gaming-devices-udev I think, to no success unfortunately. I checked that the vontrollers work when in the input group, so its definitely a permission issue. I even followed the Alpine Linux gamepad wiki entry and it still wouldn&#39;t work. As a general info I am running a Rxzen 9 7900 with an Rx 6800 and have setup the udev that is recommended on the Sway wiki page. I doubt that its going to matter for this but I am running btrfs.

Just want to know if this is a widespread problem with Proton, the game itself (maybe its also happening to windows users), or just a problem with my setup. Ive been playing Marvel Rivals a lot, and ive had it freeze multiple times on me now. Usually the game will freeze, but I can hear audio coming from the game still and cant alt-tab or anything so I have to restart my PC. It makes me kind of nervous to play comp because I dont want to get myself banned from these freezes. Id love to hear your experiences with the games performance as well :)</p> <p>(Settings/Specs: Im running Fedora KDE, using steam from the repo (non flatpak), and GE Proton 9-21.

Frame gen and low latency are set to off as well. Settings are medium because I thought it may help with the

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I think the Valve Deckard probably is not coming anytime soon. Like maybe late 2025 at the very earliest -- and only if Valve doesn&#39;t release any other hardware first (unlikely), and probably 2026 or even 2027 are much more likely. But a 2026 release could only happen for the Deckard if there are no other Valve hardware releases first. </p> <p>And if Valve releases a SteamOS Linux console first (which seems likely), it wouldn&#39;t surprise me if we are waiting until at least a couple years after that console releases for a Deckard release, because I have a hard time imagining Valve launching both a Deckard and a flatscreen console in the same year. So if there is no Steam console, maybe Deckard in 2026, and if there is a Steam console release next year sometime, then more likely the Deckard wouldn&#39;t be expected until 2027 or 2028.</p> <p>The reason I say this is because the Valve Deckard is likely to be running on Linux in some way (either a
