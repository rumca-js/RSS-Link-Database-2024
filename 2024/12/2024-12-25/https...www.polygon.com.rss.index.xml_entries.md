<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Room 237</em> is a documentary that plumbs the depths of <em>The Shining</em>, using various people’s voice-overs to guide the viewer through interpretations of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-watch/452010/best-halloween-horror-movies-tv-watch-stream">Stanley Kubrick’s seminal 1980 horror film</a>.

<p class="has-text-align-none">The <a href="https://www.polygon.com/review/498909/sonic-3-movie-review">Sonic franchise</a> is the rare movie series that’s gotten better and better with each subsequent sequel. In this case, the reason why is actually very simple: Each new one adds at least one new <a href="https://www.instagram.com/polygondotcom/reel/DC2NhDnTB8i/">Little Guy</a>. And the filmmakers have absolutely perfected making these Little Guys, translating them from their cartoony designs to “realistic” ones.</p>

Whether you have taken the requisite planes, trains, and automobiles to be with your loved ones or you are celebrating at a distance, there is often a parade of family updates — the well-wish calls that inevitably (and gratifyingly!) turn to the reports and the check-ins. Some of us come from divorced families and are well versed in the art of such phone calls, so please, take some wisdom from me here. </p>
