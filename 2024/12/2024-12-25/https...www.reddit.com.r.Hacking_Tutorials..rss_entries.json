It felt very real for almost a year, but now there are several factors that are making me uneasy and I have no way of knowing the truth about this whole matter. The thing is, I think someone is playing a cruel joke on me, toying with my emotions, and I feel like I&#39;ve reached my limit. I want to know if two or three Twitter accounts belong to the same person, but it feels like an impossible task for me and it seems very immoral to seek the help of a hacker. But in the end, how can I know the truth if not? It seems like I need the help of a hacker to get to the bottom of this.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Beginning_Client_970\"> /u/Beginning_Client_970 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking_Tutorials/comments/1hm7lts/i_need_help_please/\">[link]</a></",
