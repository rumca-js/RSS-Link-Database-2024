Merry Christmas, everyone! What better way to celebrate Christmas than conversing about expired CEOs, failed Cryptocurrencies, and [REDACTED] with the famous New York Grinch (who everyone has heard of.) Do people even read descriptions anymore? I feel like the answer is no, right? Most people are on mobile I imagine or maybe they cast it to their TV? Am I speaking to myself here? Am I trapped in the void? Oh, dear lord. Deliver me from this text block.
