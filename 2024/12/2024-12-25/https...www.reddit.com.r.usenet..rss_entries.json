From what I\u2019ve seen, there isn\u2019t much difference between them.</p> <p>Closed indexers are often seen as more desirable because they limit access with invites or strict approval. This creates a sense of exclusivity and scarcity, making people believe they\u2019re missing out on something better. In reality, the content on closed indexers is usually the same as what\u2019s available on open ones.</p> <p>Open indexers are accessible to everyone and often provide a similar level of service. They\u2019re often overlooked, not because they\u2019re less effective, but because they lack the appeal of exclusivity.</p> <p>Making an indexer closed might make it seem more valuable, but it doesn\u2019t mean it offers better service. Exclusivity is more about marketing than functionality. It creates unnecessary barriers and makes people think it\u2019s superior simply because it\u2019s harder to join.</p> <p>In",
