<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I see so many posts of users having their Linux installations borked by kernel updates. That&#39;s the context of the question. I&#39;m guessing that very new hardware can benefit from such updates. But how about anything that&#39;s 3+ years old? Wouldn&#39;t it be better just to never update the kernel if the setup is working perfectly fine?</p> <p>EDIT: Guys, this isn&#39;t meant as a provocation. I really don&#39;t fully understand this. That&#39;s why I&#39;m asking. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/otto_delmar"> /u/otto_delmar </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1hmavs7/what_is_the_point_of_updating_the_kernel/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1hmavs7/what_is_the_point_of_updating_the_kernel/">[comments]</a></span>

He says he wants something, adds it to a list somewhere, and eventually forgets why he wanted it.</p> <p>Well, I got him one of his listed items for Christmas. It was this thing: - AiTrip EEPROM BIOS USB Programmer CH341A + SOIC8 Clip + 1.8V Adapter + SOIC8 Adapter for 24 25 Series Flash</p> <p>I casually brought up a BIOS USB programmer, and he said he’s not sure what he’d use such a thing for.</p> <p>He’s into programming, data engineering, and Linux. He has several old computers laying around as a sort of “homelab” thing. Any idea what he might have wanted that for? I worry he’s going to open his present and have no memory of why he originally wanted this thing. It would be nice if I could give him cool ideas in that moment—but I literally have no idea.</p> <p>Can anyone help? What stuff does a BIOS USB programmer usually gets techy guys excited about? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.re

## Does auto-cpufreq work better for AMD cpus than TLP?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I recently migrated to Linux on my A485 Thinkpad with a 2500u Ryzen and have been trying to improve its battery life.</p> <p>Initially I tried using TLP, which many people online seem to be recommending. It seems like a great tool with great configuration options, but looking around the config I noticed most of the tweakable values seemed to be specifically for Intel chips. </p> <p>I still figured I&#39;d give it a shot and checked out some stats by monitoring powertop. </p> <p>Using TLP powerstat reported a discharge rate between 6-7 watts when idle (Linux Mint, Cinnamon). Making recommended tweaks (mostly just setting stuff on Battery mode to powersave or equivalent) I couldn&#39;t really make a difference on the reported discharge rate.</p> <p>I then switched over to auto-cpufreq and by default the idle discharge rate went as low as 5.7 watts, so it seems to me that auto-cpufreq is able to scale the cpu&#39;s state a bit better.</p> <p>Of course I

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>FastStone Image Viewer is a Windows application that allows you to manually sort images within the application via drag and drop and then bulk rename. I use this to organize my photo albums and collections. For example, I might manually reorganize a bunch of photos and then bulk rename them with a naming scheme like &quot;Tigers_001, Tigers_002&quot;, &quot;Bears_001, Bears_002&quot; etc. I know there are other ways to sort and rename the photos, but the ability to visually drag and drop them into place before bulk renaming is incredibly useful and saves a lot of time.</p> <p>Is there a Linux application that allows the same drag and drop organization functionality?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have been a Linux user for 5 years now tried multiple distros most of them were ubuntu based and some where not. But i have never use arch and always have been curious about it. But it&#39;s confusing me that I see many people complaining about the AUR and the risk that comes with it since it&#39;s maintained by the community and you can have multiple builds for the same app, also some apps may not be available on it. But at the same time I found some articles and discussions saying the exact opposite that AUR is one of the strong features about Arch and since being maintained by the community apps can be updates faster to keep up with the official release. So as an Arch user what is your take on it, why are you using it? What limitation or cons have you faced with it? </p> <p>I&#39;m just looking for more clarification before making a switch from Ubuntu for work setup [software engineer] </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I recently installed Manjaro as my first Linux distribution, and after the installation process went smoothly (thankfully), I wanted to reuse the USB stick I had bought specifically to burn the ISO image. However, my own laziness came back to bite me when I failed to properly research how to format the USB. Instead, I ended up running the <code>dd</code> command three times to write zeros to the drive, which I quickly canceled. But then, things went sideways. The USB was no longer recognized by the file system, and panic set in as I thought, &quot;Did I just ruin my brand-new USB?&quot;</p> <p>In a bit of a frenzy, I finally gathered the courage to investigate the issue more thoroughly. A quick check using <code>lsblk</code> confirmed that the USB was still there, but it had a different name and no partitions. I felt a wave of relief wash over me as the drive reappeared in the terminal. </p> <p>Determined to salvage it, I used <code>fdisk</code> to c

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello, I&#39;m working on a web browser that focuses on being truly lightweight and designed for privacy.</p> <p>At some point I&#39;ve realized that much of the complexity and resource requirements of web browsers comes from JavaScript. This is because every part needs to be dynamic and optimized for speed.</p> <p>So a few years ago I&#39;ve started to work on a web browser that intentionally doesn&#39;t implement JavaScript, instead it contains an updated set of scripts that fix and improve various websites.</p> <p>I&#39;ve been using this approach using a proxy server for a few years as my primary way of web browsing with good results. It uses a whitelist approach where no resources are loaded from different domains by default (the fix scripts can override it to load images from CDNs, etc.). This avoids any trackers by default.</p> <p>You can find more details on the homepage of the project:</p> <p><a href="https://www.fixbrowser.org/">https://www
