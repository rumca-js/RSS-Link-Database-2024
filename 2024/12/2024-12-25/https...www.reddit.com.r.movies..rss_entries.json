Yknow how so many holiday themed movies don&#39;t do enough with the holiday specifics? This is not that.</p> <p>It&#39;s like they made a point to inject christmassy elements everywhere they could. It&#39;s funny without being cringe. The violence, gore, and fighting it filmed expertly. The dialogue and acting is great. The score is SUPERB. Cinematography and editing is beautifully handled. Every character has something to do. I can&#39;t recommend it enough and it&#39;s now in the yearly Xmas rotation for sure.</p> <p>If you like dark comedy action Xmas movies, do yourself a favour!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/davidmitchellseyes\"> /u/davidmitchellseyes </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hmb9ms/violent_night_2012_is_the_sleeper_hit_i_d",

Most football movies only cover the 70s era at the earliest. Leatherheads is the only football movie I know of that has an older time setting as its set in the 1920s, but it\u2019s a comedy and not very good. What I really want to see is an earnest biopic showing a piece of football history. There\u2019s all these stories from Pre-War football especially in College Football history, with many of the big ticket rivalries spanning well over 100 years.

Its both intriguing to find out more about the main character and <span class=\"md-spoiler-text\">how everything connects to him and his brother down to the little boat toy he made for his son</span>. I think its very valuable to find writings that doesn\u2019t just dangling plot threads to no where these days. </p> <p>The acting is so so but serviceable enough it doesn\u2019t really bring the movie down for me.
