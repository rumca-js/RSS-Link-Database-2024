It's Christmas and I want to say thank you to everyone who has watched, liked, commented or subscribed to JHRA this year. It's been a busy one - I've spent much of it away recording a new Darkness album, so I've really appreciated everyone who has continued to visit. I have a LOT of things planned for 2025, so stick with me and let me know in the comments what you would like to see me cover: I want to do it all!
