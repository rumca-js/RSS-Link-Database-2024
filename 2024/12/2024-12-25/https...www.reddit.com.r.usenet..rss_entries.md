<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Open and closed indexers both serve the same purpose and seem to index the same content. From what I’ve seen, there isn’t much difference between them.</p> <p>Closed indexers are often seen as more desirable because they limit access with invites or strict approval. This creates a sense of exclusivity and scarcity, making people believe they’re missing out on something better. In reality, the content on closed indexers is usually the same as what’s available on open ones.</p> <p>Open indexers are accessible to everyone and often provide a similar level of service. They’re often overlooked, not because they’re less effective, but because they lack the appeal of exclusivity.</p> <p>Making an indexer closed might make it seem more valuable, but it doesn’t mean it offers better service.
