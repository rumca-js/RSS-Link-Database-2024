<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>A few years back i played a silly game at a board game café, it was a great palate cleanser.</p> <p>Basically, every players had 4 colored cups and 3 balls (all colored differently, 4 colors total). The balls were sufficiently big to just stick at the top of the cup like an ice cream ball.</p> <p>The game was straightforward: flip a card that reveals a &quot;construction&quot; you had to achieve with your cups and balls. But the rules stated you could never touch the balls, only handle them with the cups.</p> <p>So speed-assembling precarious constructions while being unable to manipulate the balls yourself = hilarious moments of clumsiness.</p> <p>I&#39;ve been searching for the name of the game for months and can&#39;t find it. Hoping someone would know what im talking about.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/TruesilverSolka"> /u/TruesilverSolka </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/

If the other player on a different phase were to go out first, then it would go down to whoever had the lowest points. Is that not right? I don&#39;t see anything in the rules for either, like are you just supposed to stop playing once you have completed the last phase/is there no reason to finish the round?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So, this a question for those people who have experience in playing Colt Express. It&#39;s a game that I&#39;ve had in my collection for years (since it won the Speil des Jahres in fact) but after initially not being too impressed in the last year and a half it has come back into my rotation for when I want something moderately quick, fun and funny (also good for newer players too). I&#39;ve been enjoying it so much that I have even got the Big Box expansion set this Christmas.</p> <p>My question/comment then is about the two sets of round cards, those for &lt;5 players and those for 5 or more players. The &lt;5 player round cards all tend to have between 4-6 moves per round while the 5-up player round cards have usually give 3 or 4 moves per round.</p> <p>Now the reason for this is probably obvious to anyone with any board game experience: you reduce the number of actions with increasing players in order to keep the overall play-time roughly the sam

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone. I&#39;m not a regular boardgamer but I LOVE games like Agricola and Settlers of Catan. In the last year I&#39;ve started playing boardgames with my group of friends. We&#39;ve only been playing Risk and Dixit, which has been fun but we think it&#39;s time to find new games to play. Personally, I&#39;d love to play Agricola or Settlers of Catan but I know for this group the learning curve will be too much trouble. Can anyone recommend a fun board game that has more interesting dynamics than Monopoly or Risk but doesn&#39;t have a steep learning curve like Agricola or Settlers. We are normally 4 - 7 people who play.

So it can be that the monster you wanted to defeat is allready taken care of if they reached that city first. If you defeat a monster you get either gold, influence or towers. In the end the player with the least gold is out of the game, then the player with the least towers, then the player with the least influence (or another order) so it is very important to not have the least of something.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Lazy-Internal1120"> /u/Lazy-Internal1120 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1hlzmz8/what_game_is_this/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Having played Dorfromantik with my wife and son (8) quite often this year, we gifted ourselves the Sakura variant for Xmas this year. Have only played 2 rounds we see a lot of similarity to the original however there are a few different mechanisms introduced and it looks like a deeper achievement list. </p> <p>Definitely worth it if you like the low impact cooperative style of the original, better if you can get it on sale as once you’ve exhausted the original I don’t see this holding our attention as long. If you share games with a few other groups or families and just want this for a month or so I think it’s a great buy </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/batsun"> /u/batsun </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1hlvtou/dorfromantik_sakura/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1hlvtou/dorfromantik_sakura/">[comments]</

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Picked this game up at random last week, and I think it has risen nearly to the top of my small collection since then. It&#39;s my first deduction style game (which I didn&#39;t know was a thing really I guess), and the first with an unlock legacyish mechanic as well. I&#39;ve always shied away from them because the idea of stickering or altering a game feels just...wrong...but I&#39;m loving this one. I&#39;m a sucker for lots of tokens and fancy board work which this has tons of without feeling impossible to manage. Kids find it accessible at all ages, the deduction scratches the math logic itch, and it has no analysis paralysis which I hate. We&#39;re loving working towards each new box and expanding the game! I&#39;m considering picking up the full version of Alchemists, but wasn&#39;t sure if it&#39;s the same legacy style progression or all at once - it seems like all at once would be an intimidating sell to some groups.
