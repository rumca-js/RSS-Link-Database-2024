Neutrino telescopes have been deployed in the Mediterranean Sea as part of the KM3NeT project to study high-energy cosmic particles. The project aims to detect neutrinos, elusive subatomic particles emitted from space, by using large underwater detectors. These detectors, consisting of glass spheres with photomultiplier tubes, are suspended in the water at depths of several kilometers. The telescopes will help researchers understand the origin and behavior of these high-energy particles. Despite the challenging conditions of deployment, scientists are already using the telescopes to gather valuable data, advancing research in astroparticle physics and quantum gravity

Researchers at Virginia Tech have applied algebraic geometry to improve energy efficiency in data centres. By using advanced polynomials and error-correcting codes, they have developed a new method for data storage and retrieval that reduces the need for excessive data replication and energy-intensive searching. This approach helps address the growing energy demands of data centres, which are expected to increase significantly in the coming years. The new technique allows for localised data recovery, improving performance and reducing the energy required during server failures. The research offers a sustainable solution to the power consumption challenges faced by data storage facilities

Research published in Physical Review Fluids reveals how raindrops interact with leaves, protecting plants from damage and opening avenues for technological innovations. The study, led by Professor Sunghwan Jung of Cornell University, examined the mechanics of drop-leaf interactions using high-speed imaging and a plastic beam to simulate plant behaviour. Findings show that opposing movements between droplets and leaves reduce vibrations, minimizing stress on plants. Doctoral candidate Crystal Fowler highlighted that resonance alignment enhances damping, aiding plant longevity and understanding of water flow in ecosystems. The research also explores potential renewable energy applications, proposing the use of piezoelectric materials to harvest energy from rain-induced vibrations

Astronomers have discovered a new class of cosmic explosions, known as 'millinovas,' which are 100 times brighter than the Sun. These events, first identified in 2023, were observed in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, two satellite galaxies of the Milky Way. The millinovas are thought to occur when white dwarfs feed off a companion star, producing intense X-ray emissions. The discovery could provide valuable insights into the formation of Type Ia supernovae, which are critical for measuring cosmic distances. Ongoing research aims to better understand these mysterious stellar explosions and their implications for astrophysics

A genetic study of a 1,500-year-old Moche tomb in Peru has revealed a unique sacrificial ritual involving family members. Two teenagers, one a boy sacrificed to his father and a girl to her aunt, were found buried alongside high-status individuals in a tomb at the Huaca Cao Viejo temple. This discovery, reported in PNAS, challenges previous assumptions about Moche sacrificial practices, which typically involved public, gruesome offerings. The study, which included genomic sequencing, also confirmed the familial connections between the individuals, including Señora de Cao, a prominent woman of the Moche culture. Researchers are now seeking to explore whether such familial sacrifices were common among the Moche elite.
