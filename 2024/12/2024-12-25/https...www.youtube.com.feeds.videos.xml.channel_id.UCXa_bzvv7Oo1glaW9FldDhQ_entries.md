It’s more apparent than ever that publishers are patiently waiting for Rockstar to cement a solid release date or delay GTA 6 before they make a move. The industry seems to be on pins and needles avoiding stepping on the toes of GTA 6 and its Fall release date. In this video, we outline Rockstar’s release history and explore other examples where publishers avoided another big game’s release.

This likelihood of a delay in tandem with games overshadowing smaller projects in the past lead to the conclusion that the industry is hesitant to announce stuff at the moment. And while it may seem like an overtly obvious conclusion at first glance, there have been exceptions to the rule. In GTA 6’s case though, other games would be wise to steer clear of its giant release footprint.
