<p>Java would finally shed its Java Applet API under an <a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/8345525">OpenJDK proposal</a> created December 4.</p>



<p>The JDK Enhancement Proposal notes that the API not only has been deprecated for removal for some time but is obsolete, because neither the current Java Development Kit (JDK) nor current web browsers support applets. Removal is slated for the Standard Edition of Java, although a specific JDK release not yet been designated. </p>



<p>The proposal cites multiple reasons for the APIs removal. First, the Applet API in JDK has no implementation, meaning there is no way to run an applet using the JDK. Second, browsers no longer support applets. Third, th

<p>In a world where technology increasingly shapes how cities manage safety and security, Kazakhstan’s Ministry of Internal Affairs is leading the way with its groundbreaking “Carpet CCTV” project. This ambitious initiative has revolutionized public safety by combining a massive surveillance network with advanced analytics and artificial intelligence, creating a system that shifts the focus from reactive responses to proactive prevention.</p>



<p>Over the past four years, the scope of Kazakhstan’s surveillance infrastructure has expanded dramatically. The number of cameras has grown from just 40,500 to an impressive 1.3 million, with 313,000 cameras now directly accessible to police. These camer

<p>Google has made a significant entry into the competitive AI coding tools market with Jules, an experimental coding assistant aimed at enhancing developer workflows and challenging established tools like GitHub Copilot and Amazon Q Developer.</p>



<p>The stakes are high, with AI increasingly seen as essential for accelerating software development in several industries.</p>



<p>In 2024, OpenAI’s ChatGPT emerged as the most widely adopted AI-powered tool among developers, with 82% reporting regular use, according to <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1483838/ai-tools-usage-among-developers-use-worldwide/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">data</a> from Statista.

<p>Microsoft uses its events to lift the hood on Azure’s hardware and the infrastructure it uses to manage and run its services. Ignite 2024 was no different. <a href="https://ignite.microsoft.com/en-US/sessions/BRK246">Azure CTO Mark Russinovich’s regular Inside Azure Innovations presentation</a> went into some detail about how Microsoft is working to make its data centers more efficient.</p>

<p>Language-Integrated Query, or LINQ for short, brings a query execution pipeline directly into C# and the managed environments of .NET Framework and .NET Core. LINQ provides several ways to execute queries and handle complex data manipulation tasks. Chunking is one feature of LINQ that simplifies the way you manage collections.</p>



<p>In this article, we’ll examine chunking in LINQ with code examples in C# to illustrate the concepts. To work with the code examples provided in this article, you should have Visual Studio 2022 installed in your system. If you don’t already have a copy, you can <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/">download Visual Studio 2022 here</a>.</p>
