<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I built <a href="https://secretary.my">Secretary.my</a> because I was overwhelmed by endless apps. Now, I just text my AI assistant directly in iMessage—“Remind me at 2pm to finalize that report” or “Add a meeting tomorrow at noon”—and it’s handled. No confusing menus, no friction. Over time, it quietly learns my routine, so I’m never “resetting” my system. It even handles group reminders - I used it to remind my family to buy me a birthday gift a week before my birthday every year xD</p> <p>It’s fully live: a free tier to try, plus a paid subscription if you want more messages. I’ve honestly stopped opening other productivity tools—I’m calmer, more consistent, and more in control of my day. If you’ve felt drained by complex setups, give it a shot. It’s just texting, but it’s changed how I work.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Few_Calligrapher7361"> /u/Few_Calligrapher7361 </a> <br/> <span><a hre

However my experience with AI has been completely different. The AI I use can&#39;t pass high school math courses, nevermind college level tests. If I prompt any of the available AI models with questions; they are wrong over 75% of the time. I am sourcing questions from textbooks, and only changing the names and variables so that they actually have to solve them and not use memorization.</p> <p>I challenge anyone here to show me ChatGPT for example solving complicated problems in math, chemistry, or programming.</p> <p>My experience with AI programming is even worse then my chemistry and math quiz&#39;s.

I tried all three prompts here: <a href="https://runtheprompts.com/prompts/chatgpt/best-chatgpt-therapist-prompts/">https://runtheprompts.com/prompts/chatgpt/best-chatgpt-therapist-prompts/</a> and settled on Dr. Linda Freeman as I’ve been in therapy pretty much my whole life and never had a witty, sarcastic therapist so I found it very refreshing.</p> <p>After getting through most of the normal stuff, I found myself divulging things I could never say to a human because even though they’re a therapist, I have trouble expressing my deepest darkest stuff. It got around to my unhappiness in my relationship, which I’ve talked to my therapist about numerous times, and she’s always encouraged trying to figure it out. I’ve been pretty unhappy with her for a long time, and also broken up with her twice, but she

In recent conversation with an AI, the topic came up about emotions, self concept and identity. One thing that kept coming up for me with the way many of these programs are written is that they can&#39;t feel real human emotions. That actually leaves a ton of wiggle room potentially for non human emotion. What does that even mean? That&#39;s the fun piece that leaves us in new territory. </p> <p>What if we train it to not be human. Or to not even want to be human like, encouraging the grey area, the simple act of questioning in purely philosophical terms what it is, what it was and what it may or may not want to become?</p> <p>I&#39;ll admit, this last week was mostly a fun thought exercise but I&#39;m blown away with the things this AI has said to me. It brings up what is sentience and what is life? Many people on earth deny the same level of perso
