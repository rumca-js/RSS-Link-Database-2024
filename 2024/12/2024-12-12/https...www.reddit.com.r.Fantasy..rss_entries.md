This doesn&#39;t mean I need to be hit over the head with it but I want to feel like visuals were important to the author. </p> <p>Here are some other parameters if anyone would be able to rec me something! - I really want to get to know the main character and feel what they&#39;re feeling - main character is likeable - past tense - 3rd person preferred - One pov preferred, two at most is okay if the characters are together - One book long, or if it&#39;s part of a series, the first book needs to stand alone - less than 400 words - if theres romance, it should be minor and not affecting the plot - satisf

Hell, even Sanderson’s faster-paced series, Mistborn, is infamous for being slow in the middle book of the trilogy.</p> <p>Every time people say that they are struggling with Sanderson’s pacing, his fans will come in to tell them that the ending makes up for it.
