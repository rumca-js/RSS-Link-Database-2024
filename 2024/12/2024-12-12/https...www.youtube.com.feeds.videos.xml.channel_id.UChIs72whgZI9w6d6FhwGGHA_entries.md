The Intel Arc B580 GPU is now shipping, debuting Intel's Battlemage GPU architecture in the first graphics cards of its new generation. This follows Intel's prior Alchemist Arc GPUs, including the A750, A770, A580, and A380, which had periods of hardship early on with driver issues. The B580 is a complete rework of Intel Arc. Its MSRP is $250 and the new video card is targeting the NVIDIA RTX 4060 and AMD RX 7600 in price comparison. Our benchmarks and review of the B580 card test it for 4K, 1440p, and 1080p rasterization performance, ray tracing benchmarks, efficiency, and idle power consumption.
