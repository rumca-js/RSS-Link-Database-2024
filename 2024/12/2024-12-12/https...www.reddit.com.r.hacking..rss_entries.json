        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I have a two part question regarding what cert you recommend of these 3. The first question is which certification is going to be the most and least valued by employers? after putting in hardwork, time and money to get one of these certs I would like to obtain a job in pen testing or would even be willing to start in I.T just get my foot in the door(the end goal is to be a pen tester). My second question is which one will offer the best education and the one someone who has a career college degree in I.T (know linux, networking, and cisco basics well) would get the most out of?</p> <p>To go into more detail on my experience, so I have a I.T degree 1 year course, then practiced pen testing for 1 year, currently im able to hack a windows 10 vm with firewall and windows defender disabled, and the easiest vm&#39;s from vulnhub, so I have gained some basic foundational skills over the past 2 years but im still starting out. If you have read this far thank",
