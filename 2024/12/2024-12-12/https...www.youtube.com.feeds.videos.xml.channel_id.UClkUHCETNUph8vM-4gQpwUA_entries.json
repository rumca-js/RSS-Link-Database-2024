        "description": "Wartales Gameplay Preview - Should You Play this Turn-Based Tactical RPG in 2024?\nIn this video, we\u2019re going to be taking a look at Wartales. We previously did a video for this game when it first entered early access in 2021, so about 3 years ago. The game had its 1.0 version released in April of last year in 2023 and has been steadily adding content ever since, including its brand new update, the Skelmar Invasion, that just came out a few days ago, which I\u2019ll get into in a little bit in this article. The game currently has a 90% lifetime on Steam with over 24,000 reviews.\n\nGet Wartales here! https://shiro.li/FextraLife\n\nTimestamps\n0:00 - Wartales Gameplay Preview\n0:29 - What is Wartales?\n2:31 - Wartales Exploration and Progression\n4:48 - Wartales Survival and Combat\n8:21 - Updates, Expansion Final Thoughts\n\nDon't forget to like the video and subscribe to our channel for more!\n\nFollow us on social media:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/Fextralife/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Fext",
