Introduced with C++20, they provide a way to deal with requirements and specify constraints on generic code. This can be used to improve overload resolution, avoid invalid use of generic code, improve error handling, and improve documentation of generic code.\n\nIn this talk we introduce the basics of concepts. You will get an overview of\n- the difference between requirements, concepts, and constraints\n- where you can apply concepts\n- how to formulate concepts\n- what the standard library gives you as and for concepts\n- how to design concepts right\n---\n\nSlides: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2024/blob/main/Presentations/Back_To_Basics_Concepts.pdf\n\nSponsored by JetBrains: https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/\n---\n\nNicolai Josuttis\n \nNicolai Josuttis (www.josuttis.com) is well-known in the community for his authoritative books and talks.
