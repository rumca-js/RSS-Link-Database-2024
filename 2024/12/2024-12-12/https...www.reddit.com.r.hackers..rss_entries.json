I&#39;m not sure if the program is called Knox that&#39;s installed on the phone but when I turn it on now it says I have to have login information to set it up like they did the day they gave it to me. I want to know if there is any possible way to either bypass this or even factory reset and wipe the phones security system. It&#39;s a fucking great phone and I could use it for my phone by just inserting the sim card. Any suggestions would be helpful. I&#39;ve tried searching it up online found a few things but none of them worked.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/diabloinfierno666\"> /u/diabloinfierno666 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/hackers/comments/1hcofxe/samsung_xcover_walmart_phone/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.re",
