        "description": "International Fellowship of Christians and Jews - To give to IFCJ, visit https://benforthefellowship.org/\n\nBen discusses Jamaal Bowman\u2019s letter dedicated to white people calling to end white supremacy, where he states, \u201cwhite supremacy is not skin color, it\u2019s a state of mind.\u201d He also talks about the Democrats who stood in front of the House of Representatives, suggesting the full-scale commutation of all death row sentences because of race. Democrats are also continuing to militate against the acquittal of Daniel Penny, but he is speaking out, saying left-wing policies don\u2019t work and they\u2019ve made people less safe. Ben also discusses how the Federal Trade Commission is going to deny the merger between Kroger and Albertsons so they keep competing with each other to keep prices low. \n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Click here to join the member-exclusive portion of my show: https://bit.ly/3WDjgHE\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Finish your Christmas shopping with one click.
