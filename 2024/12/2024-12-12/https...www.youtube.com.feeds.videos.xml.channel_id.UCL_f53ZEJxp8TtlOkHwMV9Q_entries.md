Dr. Jordan B. Peterson sits down with playwright Andrew Doyle and comedy writer Graham Linehan. They discuss their near-cancellations, the woke epidemic which has made comedy a criminal offense in the United Kingdom, the broader decay of the cultural landscape across Europe, why progressive ideals ruin honest works of creativity, and the totalitarian hellscape awaiting the Brits should they not change course.
