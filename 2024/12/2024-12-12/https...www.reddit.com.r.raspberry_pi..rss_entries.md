<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi folks, I&#39;m pretty new to Pi. I have a zero with the header running the most recent (12/13/24) PiOS. I followed the instructions on pimoroni website for setting up the wHAT got thrown error after error after error including the font they called for not existing (fredoka). Eventually, somehow got it to clear the default image, but have had no luck running anything since that.</p> <p>I finally tried just writing my own python script in the included complier, again following the guide on pimoroni&#39;s website. The code doesn&#39;t even make it past the first line </p> <p>from inky.auto import auto</p> <p>Says no such directory exists.</p> <p>Thinking I might just wipe the SD card and start over.

## pigpio acts oddly when used in a system service and asked to stop. Here's the workaround.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m posting this as an FYI, but also to sanity-check my results.</p> <p>I&#39;m using pigpio to control some lighting with a Pi Zero W, and it works fine. I made it into a system service and it continued to work fine - but when a did a <em>sudo system xxx stop</em>, the stop command would <em>almost</em> always hang for a long time (presumably 90 seconds, the default &quot;Just SIGKILL it&quot; timer) and then return.</p> <p>systemd uses SIGTERM when you issue a stop. In my code, I used </p> <pre><code>gpioSetSignalFunc(SIGTERM, exiting); </code></pre> <p>where exiting() is a function that just posts to a semaphore. I had another thread (my exit handler) waiting on that semaphore, which would then proceed to clean up a little, shut down pigpio, and call exit(0). This is the &quot;one true way&quot; to shut down a threaded process, since it avoids doing anything sketchy in the signal handler. Note that I use a mutex around all my calls to pigpio s
