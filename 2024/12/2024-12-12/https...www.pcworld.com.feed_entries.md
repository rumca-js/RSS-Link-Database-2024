<p>Both Amazon and Apple are playing it safe when it comes to allowing generative AI on their respective smart speakers. On the other hand, you can already chat with Google’s Gemini AI on a Nest device, and Google has now detailed how you can get in on the test. </p>



<p>The whole “there’s Gemini in my Nest!” hubbub began earlier this month, when some Nest speaker users began noticing that <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2544022/google-smart-speakers-are-starting-to-sound-like-gemini.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Google Assistant was speaking in two different voices</a>: the standard Assistant voice, and a deeper, more loquacious voice that most suspected was powered by Gemini. </p>



<p>Google has now confirmed that it’s testing Gemini on certain Nest devices, and (as <a href="https://9to5google.com/2024/12/11/gemini-google-assi

<p>We just found one of the more insane mini PC deals we’ve seen in a while. How do you explain this <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ACEMAGIC-AD08-i9-12900H-Computers-Multi-Mode/dp/B0D4YNMDP4/">Acemagic AD08 gaming mini PC that’s only $455.40 on Amazon</a>? That’s 40 percent off its $759 MSRP!</p>



<p>Let’s start at the beginning. This Acemagic AD08 was built for work, fun, and games. It’s a tiny device, but it’s mighty and packs a punch. Featuring a top-shelf Intel Core i9-12900H CPU and a hefty 32GB portion of DDR4 RAM, this sits in the upper echelon of mini PCs.</p>



<p>There’s also a speedy 512GB SSD on board, which allows you to quickly boot your system, load apps and games in a flash, and store plenty of apps, games, videos, and documents. If you really want to, you can later upgrade further because this mini PC supports up to 64GB of RAM and 2TB of

<p>Microsoft recently hinted at an <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2551776/classic-outlook-gets-an-official-death-date-and-users-are-urged-to-switch.html">official end date for the classic Outlook app</a>. You still have some time with it, but eventually you’ll need to switch over to the new Outlook app (or another email app altogether). Understandably, many users are holding off because the new Outlook is missing features that have been in classic Outlook for a while.</p>



<p>If you’re already using the new Outlook, you may have noticed that there’s no more “File” menu in the main window of the app and in the windows of open emails. Because of this, you can’t save messages in MSG format anymore in this way.</p>



<p>However, the new Outlook app does have a save feature. To save an individual email as a local file, simply open the email in a separ

<p>Sharing files between an iPhone and a Mac is super easy, barely an inconvenience. Android and Chrome have a similarly cushy relationship over on the Google side of things. But Windows doesn’t really have a steady date in the smartphone world anymore ever since Microsoft basically abandoned the segment. But today, the company is making file sharing between Windows 11 and iPhones that much easier.</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2024/12/11/sharing-files-between-your-iphone-and-windows-pc-rolling-out-to-windows-insiders/">official Windows Insider blog</a>, the newest version of Phone Link can quickly share files of any kind between Windows 11 and any iPhone running a recent version. Phone Link and its <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/link-to-windows/id6443686328">companion iOS app called Link to Windows</a>

<p>Over the past couple months, Microsoft blocked delivery of the Windows 11 24H2 update to all kinds of PCs that were incompatible or susceptible to crashes for one reason or another.</p>



<p>In late November, we reported that <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2534540/windows-11-24h2-causes-usb-scanners-and-printers-stop-working.html">various USB scanners and other devices with scanning functionality had stopped working</a> after updating to Windows 11 24H2, so Microsoft blocked the update on PCs that were connected to such devices. Today, the block on those PCs has been lifted and they’re once again able to install Windows 11 24H2.</p>



<p>The issue was that, after updating to Windows 11 24H2, devices that supported the eSCL protocol could no longer switch to USB mode and thus weren’t recognizable anymore, making scanning (and other features) no
