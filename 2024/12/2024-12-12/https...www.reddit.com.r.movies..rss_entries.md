## "Our little secret" (Netflix) is a solid 6.5 Christmas movie. Most importantly, good to see Lindsay Lohan doing well.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>The premise sounded funny, so I decided to watch. It&#39;s a Christmas movie, a bit cheesy, but are there definitely some funny moments. Good pre-Christmas watch. </p> <p>However, I was surprised that I didn&#39;t know either lead actor, so towards the end I searched the cast, and it turns out the main actress is Lindsay fucking Lohan. I honestly didn&#39;t recognize her 💀 She&#39;s beautiful but it&#39;s fun to suddenly see her at 38. The last I knew of her was her troubles in her early 20s. A friend pointed out to me that she&#39;s been on Netflix for years now doing cheesy shit like this</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Tifoso89"> /u/Tifoso89 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hcj476/our_little_secret_netflix_is_a_solid_65_christmas/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hcj476/our_little_secret_netflix_is_a_solid_65_c

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>The duel between Achilles and Hector in <em>Troy</em> (2004) is a cinematic masterpiece, blending raw intensity, emotional stakes, and philosophical depth. This climactic confrontation goes beyond being a simple battle—it’s a visceral exploration of honor, vengeance, and the inevitability of fate.</p> <p>Behold: <a href="https://youtu.be/j-Ze3KEhKnM?si=PWynmvLgzPeoIfhu&amp;t=1">https://youtu.be/j-Ze3KEhKnM?si=PWynmvLgzPeoIfhu&amp;t=1</a></p> <h1>A Clash of Ideologies</h1> <p>Brad Pitt’s Achilles embodies Greek heroism, driven by glory, wrath, and an insatiable thirst for immortality. Eric Bana’s Hector, on the other hand, is a noble defender of family and city, bound by duty and deeply human vulnerabilities. Their duel is not just physical; it’s a poignant meeting of two worldviews—one fueled by rage and ego, the other by responsibility and acceptance of mortality.</p> <h1>Choreography and Realism</h1> <p>The choreography is exceptional, balancing ci

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>If you don&#39;t know, the Wackness is a movie about a fresh out of high school teen who sells weed in 90s New York. While there he sells weed to a pyschiatrist names Dr Squires who has step daughter that he falls in live with. Honestly, the movies needs more recognition. I recommend watching it first since it&#39;s worth the hour and 40 minutes.</p> <p>First of all the movie looks absolutely beautiful. It really nails the atmosphere of 90s New York. Some examples are the Twin Towers, the Music Scene and the cinematography. The cinematography is great and has many beautiful scenes. </p> <p>Most of the characters are written quite well especially Dr Squires. The movie pretty much shows 2 stories, Luke Shapiro and Dr Squires. They both are pretty depressed and have trouble with romance. And I think Luke Shpairo and Dr Squires relationship is kinda like a father to son, they are completely differnet ages but suffer with the same problems. I think in my
