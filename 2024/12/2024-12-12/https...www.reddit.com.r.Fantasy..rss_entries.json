Hell, even Sanderson\u2019s faster-paced series, Mistborn, is infamous for being slow in the middle book of the trilogy.</p> <p>Every time people say that they are struggling with Sanderson\u2019s pacing, his fans will come in to tell them that the ending makes up for it. Which again, sounds a lot like many Robert Jordan books.

With that said, my current gripe with most modern fantasy novels is the constant PoV hopping- I do not mind one to two characters sharing chapters, even a third, but I definitely prefer being able to get to know a good extent of the world through one character&#39;s eyes and then being able to contrast that to a character who&#39;s PoV shows up later.
