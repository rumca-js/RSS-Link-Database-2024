        "description": "Despite knowing officially that The Elder Scrolls VI is in development \u2013 and it\u2019s been in the works for numerous years now \u2013 we don\u2019t actually know an awful lot else. There\u2019s no official word on release date, no story content confirmation, we don\u2019t even know which region of Tamriel it\u2019ll be set in. \n\nHowever, since the game\u2019s announcement trailer back in 2018 there have been numerous interviews and previews undertaken, with official word coming directly from Bethesda director Todd Howard. \n\nWhilst nothing stated is set in stone, it\u2019s exciting to use this information to speculate on The Elder Scrolls 6's content. This video includes some of the most substantial rumours, some with weight behind them, some tenuous at best.",
