The monster&#39;s direction of travel was influenced by the players placing magnets on a board. I&#39;m pretry sure it was a Kickstarter game.

I know this is a long shot, but hopefully collective, crowd sourced knowledge will help.</p> <p>I&#39;m looking for a board game I played like around 10 years ago. It had a sci-fi theme, was a skirmish game with miniatures or standees. Two player game with each player controlling a squad of soldiers and battling on a board. I think the only objective was to eliminate your opponent, but that could be wrong.</p> <p>For some reason, I think it had a similar aesthetic to Neuroshima Hex, but the game play was not that. This one was more of a PvP battler feel. And I believe you could choose your load out before the game?</p> <p>I know that&#39;s not a lot to go on, but maybe it will get me going in the right direction in my search.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/clinton-reddit\"> /u/clinton-reddit </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1hcd7g3/help_finding_board_",
