<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>We pay Google for our email service at work, but I do not like the website for managing email. My biggest gripe about it is the calendar notifications. i have specific days of the month where I need to complete specific tasks. If those days happen to fall on the weekend or a day I do not work, I don&#39;t get the reminder. I realize the calendar is not the same as the email, but I need software that works well together. </p> <p>I have always used Outlook, but the new Outlook has the same issue as the Gmail site does. </p> <p>My goal is to get a reminder that does not go away until I dismiss it or delay it. Outlook was great with reminders and I have no idea why it is so difficult with other software. </p> <p>Thank you</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/EverySingleMinute"> /u/EverySingleMinute </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/degoogle/comments/1hcsl8r/what_is_a_good_alternative_to_t
