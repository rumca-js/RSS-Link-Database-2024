<p>One last Letterman link: a new half-hour interview about interviewing with Zach Baron for GQ. I watched the first minute and I’m saving the rest for tonight:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Baron:</strong> If you read pieces about you — pieces of press, profile
stuff like that — from ’80s and ’90s, even a little bit in the
2000s, you were often betrayed as miserable.</p>

<p><strong>Letterman:</strong> (<em>laughs hardily</em>) Yeah, that’s great. I love that.</p>

<p>The New York Times:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>George J. Kresge, who as the entertainer the Amazing Kreskin used
mentalist tricks to dazzle audiences as he rose to fame on
late-night television in the 1970s, died on Tuesday in Wayne, N.J.
He was 89. A close friend, Meir Yedid, said the death, at an
assisted living facility, was from complications of dementia.</p>

<p>Kreskin’s feats included divining details of strangers’ personal
lives and guessing at playing cards chosen randomly from a deck.
And he had a classic trick at live shows: entrusting audience
members to hide his paycheck in the auditorium, and then relying
on his instincts to find it — or else going without payment for
a night.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Somehow his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_E_uzSCegiU">first appearance with Letterman</a> wasn’t until 1990, but after that he was a regular. Just a canonical “late night talk show guest” of that era. He was good at the mentalist tricks, but what made Kreskin great

<p>Erik Hayden, reporting for The Hollywood Reporter:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For his next move, David Letterman is jumping in to the
increasingly crowded free, ad-supported TV channel (FAST) space.</p>

<p>The late-night great’s production company Worldwide Pants has
inked a deal with Samsung TV Plus to bring around 4,000 hours of
original video to the company’s streaming service, the firms said
Wednesday. “I’m very excited about this,” stated Letterman, who
glibly added, “Now I can watch myself age without looking in the
mirror!”</p>

<p>The output for the 24/7 on-demand channel titled Letterman TV
appears to rely heavily on archival clips from his nearly 33-year
late-night run, including his CBS Late Show Top Ten lists, “Stupid
Tricks” segments, interviews with stars, holiday specials and
behind-the-scenes clips along with fresh commentary from
Letterman, presumably on all the above.</p>
