If you convert many of the Xbox Game Pass games to also work with VR as an enhanced way of playing games, which we all know makes 3rd person games better (like Moss), could Microsoft be paving the way to partner with Meta to bring VR to Xbox with a preexisting hardware base, a ton of first-party titles that could be played with \u201cVR POV\u201d, and the ability to do amazing Mixed Reality games that would work on Game Pass, and first-party titles with demanding graphics that would work in VR over WiFi six with pre-existing VR titles like Skyrim VR and Fallout 4 VR? </p> <p>(Far out side note: Also, I feel like this could be yet another way for Fortnite to release a new gameplay mode\u2026VR Battle Royale as a free to play when played through Xbox?)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/",

I returned to VR and the sharpness is not quite there and the FPS is also lower, I would like to get some advice on how to make it run better.</p> <p>My current system is an i5-10400F cpu, 2x16 GB DDR4 memory and an RX 6700 XT.</p> <p>I know my cpu is not the best, but when I look at the data my GPU render time is the worst always.</p> <p>I&#39;m thinking about buyin a new Ryzen 3d cpu, but I don&#39;t know if the new motherboard and the DDR5 memory is worth it. Perhaps an i5-13600k would be better, and for GPU I don&#39;t know what to buy, an RX 7800 XT, RX 7900 GRE or maybe an nvidia RTX 4070.</p> <p>On top of that I think my current 600W power supply is going to be weak for the new system as well.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddi",

The popular Quest 3, new Vive Focus Vision and the Vive XR Elite.</p> <p>My primary needs are media consumption and secondary is gaming. I\u2019m assuming either of the Vive headsets would be overkill for what I\u2019m looking for? Budget isn\u2019t a concern but I wouldn\u2019t want to over spend if it doesn\u2019t justify the money. </p> <p>Ideally my choice would be whatever has the best mixed reality capabilities as my goal here is to watch sports via YouTube TV wirelessly while working around the house with the headset on and still being good enough to get a solid gaming session in on the newest VR releases. Not planning to do much multiplayer VR though. </p> <p>I have a good router with 1-gig internet and a beefy pc so that side of things is covered. Any other options I should consider? I\u2019d like the Apple Vision Pro given I have about 20 Apple products b",
