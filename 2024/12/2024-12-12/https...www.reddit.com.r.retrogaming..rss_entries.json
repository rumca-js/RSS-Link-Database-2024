        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I just noticed that Castlevania, really is about finding the treasures and secrets, the original game for the nes. Dracula? Dracula is just a side quest. The real deal is finding that sweet treasure within the castle, crouching in places, finding money bags, brilliant crowns and who knows what more. The real competition in that game and real objective, is that score board and getting filthy rich. No wonder the Belmont family is soo filthy rich? They raided Draculas castle so many times as with other monster lairs that they even managed to build an amazing underground library full of relics over a fort and are considered nobles, as seen in the anime. Which by the way was great.</p> <p>Reminds me of the avgn video about the cripto stuff in Castlevania II, the tornado, crouching in certain places, it has always been about crouching and finding loot or secrets.</p> <p>I wonder what else there is, special coin bags, the crown, now I get my brother wanting",
