A new study suggests warm days on Mars often precede dust storms, with researchers analysing data from NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. The findings show 78% of storms correlate with increased solar heating, particularly in northern regions of the planet. Scientists have developed an algorithm predicting certain storm types with 64% confidence, marking progress in understanding these atmospheric phenomena. Despite advancements, questions about the growth of localised storms into global events remain unresolved. This research could improve planning for future Mars missions.

The decades-old "sofa problem," a mathematical puzzle concerning the largest sofa that can fit around a right-angled corner, has reportedly been resolved. Mathematician Jineon Baek, a postdoctoral researcher at Yonsei University in South Korea, has provided new findings suggesting that Joseph Gerver’s U-shaped sofa design is the most efficient and optimal solution. Baek’s research narrows the maximum area of the hypothetical sofa to precisely 2.2195 units, ending debates that ranged between 2.2195 and 2.37 units. His findings were shared on the preprint website ArXiv and await peer-review validation. This breakthrough settles a problem first proposed by Leo Moser in 1966 and confirms Gerver’s earlier calculations as accurate. The mathematical community has shown considerable interest in this development.
