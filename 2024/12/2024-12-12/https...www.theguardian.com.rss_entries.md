But at a public funeral for Mazen al-Hamadah – before his disappearance in 2020 one of the most vocal survivors of torture in the regime’s prisons system – the joy gave way to sorrow, as the country begins to grapple with the fact that many of the estimated 130,000 people missing may be lost forever.</p><p>Thousands of people flooded the streets on Thursday, following Hamadah’s body, wrapped in a traditional white shroud, as it was driven slowly from a hospital to the Abdulrahman Abu al Ouf mosque for funeral prayers.

<p>England captain admits he ‘spoke a little too much’ about Australia showdown instead of New Zealand and India Tests</p><p></p><p>England are about to complete their busiest year of Test cricket with Ben Stokes encouraged by the overhaul in personnel that has taken place.

 The third Test against New Zealand that starts in Hamilton on Saturday (10pm Friday UK) will be England’s 17th in 2024, matching only their fixture list in 2016 by way of volume.

<p>Clothes made from a canine you know are much more special than clothes from an anonymous sheep</p><p>Several decades ago, the idea arose of writing a book to examine the ways in which dog hair could be used by knitters. Most people thought the concept was a few puppies short of a litter, if not downright crazy. The exceptions were experienced spinners (for whom dog hair was merely another nifty fiber to experiment with) and people of exceptional vision and imagination (nearly all of whom owned beloved dogs who shed exasperating quantities of fuzz).</p><p>The project began when I was spinning fluff from Ollie, a Great Pyrenees belonging to my friends Barbara Binswanger and Jim Charlton. Like many spinners, I already knew that dog fuzz could be spun – many books devoted to the craft of spinning carried a paltry brief paragraph on it, but the information was often sketchy and seemed like an afterthought, a footnote to more substantial sections on alpaca, vicuña and other exotic fiber
