Other problems we experienced are like applications used in industry as the standard, in our for example is Graphpad prism (well, not like I want this since I use R and python and do everything there), other examples are MS office. Games are also pain in the ass.</p> <p>Recently, I&#39;m trying to make Elan",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>So, being new to Linux, and looking for a summary of the patch notes, I was referred to a Linux newbies site. However, while it contains very good information for minor versions, it does not cover patch versions. Since <a href=\"https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v6.x/ChangeLog-6.12.4\">https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v6.x/ChangeLog-6.12.4</a> is way too verbose to be a summary, I asked AI to help per <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1hbfsgv/kernel_6124_changelog_summary/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1hbfsgv/kernel_6124_changelog_summary/</a>, but I felt it was still too generalized. So, I rolled up my sleeves a bit. Enter lkcl, a tiny-ish script:</p> <p>The following will grab your current kernel release from uname and spit back the title of every commit in the changelog, sorted for easier perusal.</p> <p><code>lkcl</code></p> <p>The following will do the same as the above, but for a specific release.</p> <p><c",

We hear a lot about how Mint is great for beginners coming from Windows because the UI is familiar.</p> <p>That got me thinking. What is the least Windows-like, or most Linux/Unix -like distro? What takes the most traditional *nix approach, whatever you think that may be? </p> <p>I suppose if I wanted something that looked more traditional I&#39;d go through the effort of using NsCDE.
