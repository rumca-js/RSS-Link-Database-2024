<p>If you have no interest in watching regional sports networks, Fubo no longer requires you to pay for them.</p>



<p>This week, the live TV streaming service introduced a new tier called “Fubo Essential.” While it has the same $80-per-month advertised price as the “Fubo Pro” plan, it excludes regional sports channels such as Fanduel Sports Network, and therefore does not have <a href="https://www.techhive.com/article/1508497/fubotv-regional-sports-fees.html">Fubo’s usual regional sports fees</a>. Depending on where you live, those fees would add at least $12 per month to the total price.</p>



<p>The regional sports-free option brings Fubo’s pricing more in line with other top live TV streaming services such as <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/582942/youtube-tv-review.html">YouTube TV</a> ($73 per month) and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/articl

<p>Well, here’s a lump of coal for your holiday stocking: Google just announced a stiff price hike for YouTube TV starting in the middle of next month. </p>



<p>In an email sent to YouTube TV subscribers, Google said that it will boost the monthly price of its live TV streaming service to $82.99, a $10-a-month increase over the current $72.99 monthly rate. </p>

<p>The price hike will go into effect on January 13, 2025, just a couple of weeks after the new year. Existing subscribers will see the price increase on their first bill following that date. </p>

<p>Online backup is an essential hedge against any disaster that might befall your computer or local storage devices. Mechanical failure, acts of malice, or natural disasters are omnipresent threats to the files and folders you have stored on your PC.</p>



<p>While we always recommend keeping a local backup for quick restores (see our roundup of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407021/best-windows-backup-software.html" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407021/best-windows-backup-software.html">best Windows backup software</a> for desktop solutions), uploading your data to an online backup service is a reliable way to cover your bases.

<p>A new monitor might just be what you need this holiday season to kick your PC workstation setup to the next level next year. And right now, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-ViewFinity-Ultra-WQHD-Borderless-LS34C502GANXZA/dp/B0C1KPXPM9/">this Samsung ViewFinity S5 monitor is down to $220 on Amazon</a>, a hefty 42 percent discount that brings it to its all-time best price.</p>

With AMD FreeSync, your monitor’s refresh rate and graphics card will stay in sync to reduce image tearing while you game.</p>

<p>The processor of current PCs is usually powerful enough to work smoothly with all types of content. However, some processes put a higher load on the processor — for example, when you watch videos.</p>



<p>Still, playback is usually smooth because streaming providers automatically reduce the video quality if the internet connection is not fast enough or the PC’s performance is insufficient.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, it makes sense to reduce the load on the CPU because this reduces power consumption and the battery lasts longer on laptops.</p>



<p>The graphics unit (GPU) of the PC is located in the main processor, in a separate graphics chip, or on a dedicated graphics card. The GPU often doesn’t have much to do apart from displaying the desktop. But the graphics chip is often more powerful than the CPU when it comes to playing (decoding) videos.</p>

<p>Although I own a Mac Mini and dabble in using macOS, my allegiance has always been to Windows.</p>



<p>I juggle a lot of tasks in my everyday PC use — from writing and researching to communicating via Slack and email — and Windows has always just felt faster. That’s largely because of the Windows taskbar and how it helps with managing my, er, windows. I’ve never found a workflow on macOS that felt as efficient.</p>



<p>But that changed when I finally started using <strong>Stage Manager</strong>, the window management feature that Apple first introduced in 2022. While it’s sometimes maligned as unpolished — and could certainly use some improvements — it’s the one feature that finally made macOS click for me.</p>

<p>2024 has been a big year for on-device AI in consumer electronics. Both Microsoft and Apple took swings with their respective operating systems, with Microsoft <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2382750/7-vital-things-to-know-before-buying-a-windows-copilot-laptop.html">debuting its “Copilot+ PC” branding for AI-capable laptops</a> and Apple releasing Apple Intelligence.</p>



<p>These early examples offered mixed results. Some features, like real-time translations and on-device speech-to-text, can be useful. Others, like Microsoft’s Windows Recall, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2535272/microsoft-recall-windows-ai-tested-hands-on.html">have yet to prove themselves</a>.</p>
