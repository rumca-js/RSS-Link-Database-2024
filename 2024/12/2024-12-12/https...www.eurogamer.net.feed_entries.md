Intel is aiming squarely at the budget gamer with the $250 Arc B580, promising 12GB of VRAM and average performance that is, according to its own benchmarks, around 10 percent faster on average than the market leader: Nvidia's more expensive RTX 4060 8GB. A B570 is following in January, with a mild haircut to shaders, bandwidth and VRAM (10GB), with a mooted $220 price-point.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-intel-arc-b580-review-the-fastest-mainstream-gpu-and-12gb-of-vram-is-the-cherry-on-top">Read more</a></p>
