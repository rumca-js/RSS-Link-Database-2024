I would like a device that employees could enter a code into/fingerprint to track time and this could be translated into either an excel/loaded to Quickbooks or even loaded to my phone in some way and tracked real time. Because I travel to multiple job sites, I need the device to be portable and to track time regardless if I have Wi-Fi or not. Any suggestions would be appreciated.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/blondieandblue8\"> /u/blondieandblue8 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1hcb4t8/on_premise_time_clock_solution/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1hcb4t8/on_premise_time_clock_solution/\">[comments]</a></span>",

So I am thinking of self hosting mattermost (for chat and collaboration), frappehr (for employee management), mkdocs (for documentation and SOP), ERPNext(for accounting) and 1 more open source softwares for screensharing.
