Floating shower bench tip…I use 2-inch KERDI-BOARD for the bench top. I router the bottom to reflect the bracket width and thickness. Then I apply KERDI-FIX adhesive to the top and sides of the bracket. It’s important to keep the bench top level for the next steps. Many thanks to Schluter for providing the materials for my client’s custom shower 🙏🏽❤️🍊#showerbench #floatingbench #showerremodel #bathroominspiration #schlutersystems #brandpartner
