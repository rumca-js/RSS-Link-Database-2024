I colorized, restored, and crafted the sound design for this captivating video showcasing the San Francisco Bay Area in the 1950s. It takes you on a drive through the city, offering a nostalgic journey back in time.

Video Restoration Process:
✔ FPS boosted to 60 frames per second 
✔ Image resolution boosted up to HD 
✔ Improved video sharpness and brightness 
✔ Colorized only for the ambiance (not historically accurate)
✔added sound design only for the ambiance
