Resident Evil has enjoyed consistent and widespread critical acclaim with games like Resident Evil 2 Remake, Resident Evil 7 and Resident Evil Village.

Despite knowing officially that The Elder Scrolls VI is in development – and it’s been in the works for numerous years now – we don’t actually know an awful lot else. There’s no official word on release date, no story content confirmation, we don’t even know which region of Tamriel it’ll be set in. 

However, since the game’s announcement trailer back in 2018 there have been numerous interviews and previews undertaken, with official word coming directly from Bethesda director Todd Howard. 

Whilst nothing stated is set in stone, it’s exciting to use this information to speculate on The Elder Scrolls 6's content. This video includes some of the most substantial rumours, some with weight behind them, some tenuous at best.
