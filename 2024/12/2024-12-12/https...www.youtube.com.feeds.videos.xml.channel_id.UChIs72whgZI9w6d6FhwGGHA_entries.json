This follows Intel's prior Alchemist Arc GPUs, including the A750, A770, A580, and A380, which had periods of hardship early on with driver issues. The B580 is a complete rework of Intel Arc. Its MSRP is $250 and the new video card is targeting the NVIDIA RTX 4060 and AMD RX 7600 in price comparison. Our benchmarks and review of the B580 card test it for 4K, 1440p, and 1080p rasterization performance, ray tracing benchmarks, efficiency, and idle power consumption.\n\nFind the Intel Arc B580 basics & specs here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1fEpWy9B0c\nAnd the architectural information here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGD41i5QCyk\n\nWHILE IT LASTS, you can use code 'PUCKGAMERSNEXUS' for 10% off the GN store.
