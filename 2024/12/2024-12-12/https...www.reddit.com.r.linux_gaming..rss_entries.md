<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m an i3wm guy but I often hear people talk about Wayland being the future, so when I got a new GPU I went for the 7900xtx to be able to support Wayland better when I was ready to transition as I often hear terrible things about getting NVIDIA cards and Wayland to play nice. Hyprland seemed like the natural choice being a Wayland WM. I tried it out about 2 months ago and unfortunately the performance was absolutely abysmal and gamescope made zero difference. </p> <p>Only games I tested were CP2077 and Minecraft Java with some mods, normally I can run that Minecraft install with shaders on at 120fps pretty easily at 3440x1440, CP2077 same res, all high, rt off at 105 fps in the benchmark. On hyprland Minecraft could barely run at 40fps while moving with shaders off, and moving caused heavy stuttering, and CP2077 benchmark at the same settings came back around 15-20fps. It seemed like anytime there was motion games just stuttered like crazy.</p> <

On Windows, I used to launch Steam Big Picture, and could control everything with my XBox Wireless Controller from the Couch, I did not even have a keyboard in the living room. I used Steam as a &quot;Primary&quot; Launcher, covering 80 % of my gaming needs, for the rest I added Epic/EA etc. as &quot;non-steam games&quot;. Steam also has this feature on Windows where you hold the xbox button on the controller and it emulates your mouse, very handy for 3rd party launchers without controller support.</p> <p>Now for linux, the way to go seems less obvious, as there is a plethora of launchers, runtimes, storefronts, 3rd party clients etc., and the installation with sandboxes, rpms, flatpaks etc. adds a bit more complexity on top of that.</p> <p>What I am looking for is one launcher to bind them all, to rule them... eh sorry I mean to start with a nice graphics interface tha

I currently have an RTX 3080 and an AMD 5700X3D. </p> <p>I have been pretty happy with the performance on CachyOS and most of the indie games I play work fine. I have a siloed install of Windows on a secondary drive that I use for VR games, Gamepass, and the few multiplayer games with friends that aren&#39;t supported on Linux.
