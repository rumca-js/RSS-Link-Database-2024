They’re lying about me to paint me out as being a toxic, mean and unforgiving person (among much worse other things). </p> <p>I’ve been really hurt the last week or so since finding out because I thought we were close friends but it looks like I was very wrong. It’s made me extremely depressed and it’s been triggering stuff that happened in other friendships and early life trauma. </p> <p>So if you have any recommendations, I would really appreciate them.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Any recs for nonfiction books that show the “real” side of history (or at least a non-whitewashed “must be the heroes” version)? It’s kinda vague but I’m thinking like Exploration eras, impacts across Asia and Africa, what actually happened during slavery and the Holocaust, even Apartheid. Russia invading/taking over Europe, Japan and China taking over places in Asia, Shanghai being split between native and foreign influences in the 1910s-1950, Hong Kong going through Japanese and British occupations before being “given back” to China. </p> <p>One thing to note is that I don’t really enjoy memoirs/autobiographies when they are done by politicians or celebrities. Journals and anecdotes from common people or even soldiers would be more my line of thinking. In addition, of course, to more textbook like formatting with facts, maps, and timelines. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/MDS2133"> /u/MDS2133

My sister has been mentioning that she wants to get into reading (yay!!), so I was planning to get her a book or two for Christmas.

I’ve tried to get her to read one of my thrillers, but she gets confused with multiple povs, unreliable narrators, lots of shocking twists, and the like. I know she likes dystopian and fantasy, so I want to stick with those genres. She read Percy Jackson for school and part of The Maze Runner and really enjoyed those! I think she would also like romantic elements, but would get bored with straight up romance - I also don’t want to gift my little sister smut lol. She has mentioned wanting to read ACOTAR, but I’m not too sure if she will really like it or if she’s just drawn to it because it’s trendy right

Really the whole thing was kind of confusing and was really just about why it&#39;s better to buy used clothes because they&#39;re more eco-friendly and made into a story. Which is a fine idea to add into a story but that&#39;s pretty much ALL it was about. The second and fourth story were also pretty confusing and in need of editing.

This is a variant of the abilities of the hero of the film &quot;<em>The Butterfly Effect</em>&quot;, but without the ability to return directly (since even if the hero has a time machine, then at the moment where he moved, he does not have it).</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/IliaKWriter"> /u/IliaK

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Looking for a book to gift my dad this Christmas. Typical foreign dad- very set in his ways, hates talking about his feelings, egotistical, too prideful to apologize for things, impulsive in his reactions and obsessive about the smallest things. He&#39;s just become a nightmare to live with, and my mom&#39;s pretty close to divorcing him because of it. He hates the idea of therapy, so any book with therapy in the title is a no-go. He has gotten really into doing things to be as scientifically &#39;healthy&#39; as possible, so I think he would read something geared toward the science of emotional intelligence. Basically looking for a book that would equate to a few sessions of therapy for a 50-year-old man... if that exists.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Ok folks, I’m presenting a challenge. I don’t have time to sit and read so I listen to audiobooks while working around the house or on the days when I have to take my 1-1/2 hour drive to work. As much as I would love non-fiction I find it hard to concentrate on them while driving so I prefer fiction. There lies the problem. </p> <p>My tastes can be a bit…varied. Depending on my mood I will grab different styles. Let me list some authors/books I liked and hope you can give me some suggestions. </p> <p>Terry Pratchett- I read all of Discworld including the Science Of books plus Nation. </p> <p>Douglas Adams - HHGTTG and Dirk Gently. Clive Cussler - all of the Dirk Pitt plus the Oregon Files and others. JRR Tolkien. Tom Clancy - both his and the ones that were ghostwritten. Along those lines I’ve read Vince Flynn, Brad Thor, Stephen Coonts. Michael Crichton. Preston &amp; Child. James Rollins.<br/> Steve Berry. Larry Niven. Robert Heinlein. Isaac Asimov

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Title sums it up. I want something preferably without dated scientific conclusions and other information. I am the layperson in this case, but I won’t shy away from books with jargon and complex descriptions, as long as they aren’t designed for people explicitly in that area of expertise.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m an author and starting research for my next book. It&#39;s about a young woman from a political family, very loosely based of the Kennedy&#39;s. Does anyone have book recommendations about the family, or another political dynasty if you have one in mind. I&#39;m not looking for biographies or anything specific to any one member of the family, more so on their political impact and family dynamic.
