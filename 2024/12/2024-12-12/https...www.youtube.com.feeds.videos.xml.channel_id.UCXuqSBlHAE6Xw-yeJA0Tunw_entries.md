After launches ranging from whelming (RX 7600) to insulting (RTX 4060), we finally have a good budget contender: The Intel Arc B580. This Battlemage GPU brings impressive performance at a price that is better than any other video card out there right now. Better than the 4060 Ti, the 6700 XT, and pretty much any other card. Intel and their Xe2 architecture have impressed.
