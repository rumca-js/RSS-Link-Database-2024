<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So the situation is that we have teachers in university, who use a particular pc everyday. They login into their institution account on the browser and then logout</p> <p>Is there a way to some how track what they have been writing by any sort of technique. Also there is administration permission set and it requires password to download apps or from usb. Is there any weak chain to break open this situation and get the desired data?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Imaginary-King5443"> /u/Imaginary-King5443 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking_Tutorials/comments/1hcmdhk/how_to_collect_passwords_from_a_user_typing_into/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking_Tutorials/comments/1hcmdhk/how_to_collect_passwords_from_a_user_typing_into/">[comments]</a></span>
