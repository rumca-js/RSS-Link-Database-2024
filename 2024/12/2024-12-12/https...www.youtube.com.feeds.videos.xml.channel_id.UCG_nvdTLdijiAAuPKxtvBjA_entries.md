The Crow is a new 2024 remake of the 90s angst movie starring Pennywise the Clown, brought to you by the studio behind such recent hits as Borderlands and Megalopolis. And of course, it became another box office flop that nobody liked. And one of the central reasons behind that is that the movie tries to recapture 90s gritty cinematic darkness so poorly that it becomes emo cringe. So in today's video, let's go through The Crow to see when cinematic angst turns ridiculous. This is a movie that even Batman would laugh at.
