Kresge, who as the entertainer the Amazing Kreskin used\nmentalist tricks to dazzle audiences as he rose to fame on\nlate-night television in the 1970s, died on Tuesday in Wayne, N.J.\nHe was 89. A close friend, Meir Yedid, said the death, at an\nassisted living facility, was from complications of dementia.</p>\n\n<p>Kreskin\u2019s feats included divining details of strangers\u2019 personal\nlives and guessing at playing cards chosen randomly from a deck.\nAnd he had a classic trick at live shows: entrusting audience\nmembers to hide his paycheck in the auditorium, and then relying\non his instincts to find it\u2009\u2014\u2009or else going without payment for\na night.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Somehow his <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_E_uzSCegiU\">first appearance with Letterman</a> wasn\u2019t until 1990, but after that he was a regular. Just a canonical \u201clate night talk show guest\u201d of that era. He was good at the mentalist tricks, but what made Kreskin great",
