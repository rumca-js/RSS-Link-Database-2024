## Severe under-extrusion with Creality Ender 3 v2‚Ä¶ I swear I‚Äôve tried EVERYTHING!

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have an Ender 3 v2 with a CR Touch and for the past few weeks I‚Äôve been having some bad under-extrusion issues. I feel like I‚Äôve tried everything and I‚Äôm still having the same problem.</p> <p>I feel confident that the issue is in the extruder. When I print, and the print gaps, the extruder still turns (the blue handle spins), but I can feel that the filament isn‚Äôt pushing through. In this instance, when I put pressure on the filament to push it through, it begins to work. It does often fix itself, but the under-extrusion comes right back later.</p> <p>My guess is the extruder is damaging the filament and causing it to briefly jam at the Bowden tube fitting.</p> <p>I‚Äôve put my settings and the list of things I‚Äôve tried below. I have a dual-gear extruder coming in the mail that I hope will fix it, but I‚Äôm wondering if there is something else I‚Äôve missed.</p> <p>Images: <a href="https://imgur.com/a/v4xNL4E">https://imgur.com/a/v4xNL4E</a></p> <p> </p>
