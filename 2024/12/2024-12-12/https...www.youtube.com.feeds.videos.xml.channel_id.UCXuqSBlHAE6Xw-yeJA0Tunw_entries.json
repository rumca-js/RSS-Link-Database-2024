This Battlemage GPU brings impressive performance at a price that is better than any other video card out there right now. Better than the 4060 Ti, the 6700 XT, and pretty much any other card. Intel and their Xe2 architecture have impressed.\n\nDiscuss on the forum: https://linustechtips.com/topic/1592197-the-arc-b580-is-actually-great-affordable/\n\n\u25ba GET OUR MERCH: https://lttstore.com\n\u25ba GET EXCLUSIVE CONTENT ON FLOATPLANE: https://lmg.gg/lttfloatplane\n\u25ba GET A VPN: http://www.piavpn.com/linus\n\u25ba SPONSORS, AFFILIATES, AND PARTNERS: https://lmg.gg/partners\n\nPurchases made through some store links may provide some compensation to Linus Media Group.\n\nCHAPTERS\n----",
