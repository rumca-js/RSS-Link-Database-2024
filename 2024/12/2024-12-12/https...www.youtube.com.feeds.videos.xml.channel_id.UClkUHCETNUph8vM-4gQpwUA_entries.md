Wartales Gameplay Preview - Should You Play this Turn-Based Tactical RPG in 2024?
In this video, we’re going to be taking a look at Wartales. We previously did a video for this game when it first entered early access in 2021, so about 3 years ago. The game had its 1.0 version released in April of last year in 2023 and has been steadily adding content ever since, including its brand new update, the Skelmar Invasion, that just came out a few days ago, which I’ll get into in a little bit in this article. The game currently has a 90% lifetime on Steam with over 24,000 reviews.
