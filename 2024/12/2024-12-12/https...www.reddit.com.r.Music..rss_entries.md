Knowing there has been a decline in the use of saxophone in popular music, I decided to google to see if someone had made a graph to show when the decline happened.</p> <p>I told my son that the saxophone was so popular that the Americans even voted for a guy to be president just because he played the saxophone. However, when I saw the decline in saxophones appearing in popular music occurred at the same time that Bill Clinton became president, I was not so sure that there was any correlation.</p> <p>This is not a political post. I&#39;m not American, and even if I were, I would have voted for him

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have now seen so many reels of these stupid shows, featuring washed up pop artists covering their mouths and gasping at almost universally unremarkable performers. </p> <p>There is always this manufactured, over the top “turning point” where the performance suddenly escalates in a dramatic but silly way and the camera cuts to the multiple judges showing their visible astonishment at the “majestic” mind-blowing presentation. Maximum cringe. The worst part of all of this is a large number of these acts get forced into the mainstream, as if this is adequate ascension to fame compared to the organic hustle undertaken by generations of artists before them. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Stepin-Fetchit"> /u/Stepin-Fetchit </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1hcqo3d/does_anyone_find_these_american_idol_style_shows/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.red
