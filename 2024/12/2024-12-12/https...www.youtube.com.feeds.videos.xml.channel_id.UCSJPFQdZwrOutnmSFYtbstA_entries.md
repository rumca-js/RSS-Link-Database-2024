Its not looking good for Sony's non-Spiderman Spiderverse, with the impending flop of Kraven The Hunter. Meanwhile War of the Rohirrim is getting savage reviews. On the plus side though, the trailer for 28 Years Later looks excellent. Join me, MauLer, Random Film Talk, Echo Chamberlain and Northern English B*stard for a chat.
