        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi everyone.</p> <p>This may be a niche question but I&#39;m curious if there&#39;s any solution for it. Suppose I have a code involving specific operations (say, for example, matrix multiplication), and that it is not expected to change much over time. I wish to identify and buy a platform that implements just the bare minimum extensions required by the code.</p> <p>My question is: <strong>given a code, is there any tool that tells me which extensions does my platform need to implement?</strong></p> <p>Do RISC-V compilers give this kind of information? Also, I understand this is a nuanced question; e.g., I understand that, even if your platform doesn&#39;t have a given extension, you still can &quot;trap-and-emulate&quot; some of the non-implemented operations (at the cost of performance). Anyways, any sort of feedback will be appreciated.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/traquitanas\"> /u/traquit",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi all, in my last post, I mentioned that I am interested in benchmarking my custom RV32I core, however I am a complete novice in this. Right now, I just have my SystemVerilog files (core modules) and no access to any hardware. The core runs at around 120 MHz. I would like to try out Dhrystone benchmark and Fibonacci sequence benchmark as well. I have already installed riscv32-gnu-toolchain on my host linux system. </p> <p>My questions are:</p> <ol> <li><p>Since I do not have access to hardware, do I need to install QEMU or any other simulator?</p></li> <li><p>Does making minor changes in the Makefile suffice? In some repositories, I have seen &quot;syscalls.c&quot; and &quot;link.ld&quot; scripts. Do I need these to run the benchmarks? </p></li> </ol> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/riffsandtrills\"> /u/riffsandtrills </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1hccn54/strugglin",
