You can be naughty or nice. There is a list â€” doubly checked. The list says who gets benefits and who gets punishments. And, especially, you have to believe in the man at the literal top of the world who can enter every home.</p> </blockquote> <p>But the post URL is not found <a href="https://netnewswire.blog/2024/12/11/are-we-training.html">https://netnewswire.blog/2024/12/11/are-we-training.html</a></p> <p>Mistake? Hacking? Amusing whatever it was.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/chickenandliver"> /u/chickenandliver </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1hc9ddg/you_ok_netnewswire/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1hc9ddg/you_ok_netnewswire/">[comments]</a></span>
