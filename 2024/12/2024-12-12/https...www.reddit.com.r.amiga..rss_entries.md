<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi <a href="/r/amiga">r/amiga</a> I didn&#39;t have an Amiga system as a kid or anything but am a fan of games that were &quot;before my time&quot; and want to explore the Amiga games library. The thing is I have zero familiarity with the system, just looking at a list of all the games available is a bit overwhelming so I&#39;m curious if anyone might be able to make a recommendation or two based on some of the games I&#39;ve enjoyed from NES/SNES/PC Engine like Zelda, Castlevania, Ys, Crystalis, Faria, and Chrono Trigger.</p> <p>I do prefer fantasy settings but games with mechs/robots are cool too.

## B.A.T. is was an Excellent game. Once is not customary, the Atari ST version was actually better (sound ambiance richer, more features, and a much better intro music). But still, it is an awesome game on the Amiga.
