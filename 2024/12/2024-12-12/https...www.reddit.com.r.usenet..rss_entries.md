<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Since joining Usenet, I&#39;ve been using Newshosting with Geek &amp; Slug. Suddenly, I&#39;m experiencing low health on some fresh and relatively old content (around 10 years old). I was considering a second provider and additional indexers, but I&#39;m not sure if another indexer will help me complete grabs. I&#39;ve read about DMCA and NTD. I was thinking about Eweka, but it&#39;s on the same backbone. UsenetExpress uses a different backbone but is also subject to DMCA. My question is: what can I do to improve this?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/evilbulk"> /u/evilbulk </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1hcr9ly/i_need_advice/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1hcr9ly/i_need_advice/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am using two UseNets. NewsHosting and Frugal. Paired with 3 indexers for Radarr. Geek, DS NZfinder. If i look at the stats in SAB for the previous month have around 90% success rate. This is now dropping to a 50% success rate in the last few days and seems to be declining. Is something up?</p> <p>Not sure if I should be adding more indexers to help find the missing articles or if there is an actual hosting issue?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Stumbows"> /u/Stumbows </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1hcb9o2/suddenly_lots_of_missing_articles/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1hcb9o2/suddenly_lots_of_missing_articles/">[comments]</a></span>

This Black Friday I picked up lifetimes on ninja and althub even though geek had everything I needed. I have about a month worth of comparison data and I gotta say I am pleasantly surprised. One caveat is I applied the trash guides recently and that may be something to consider. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/danni3boi"> /u/danni3boi </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://i.redd.it/1whx02o5yb6e1.jpeg">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.redd
