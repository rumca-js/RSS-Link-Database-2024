ShotSpotter spent a few years feeling really sure its tech was capable of detecting gunshots. It felt so confident it didn&#8217;t mind (allegedly) fudging detection data to help cops secure criminal charges against people who might not have been actual criminals. Then it all started falling apart. Lots of cop shops and the cities that [&#8230;]

Here on Techdirt, we write a lot about content moderation and even did a whole big series of content moderation case studies. However, here&#8217;s an interesting one that involves Techdirt itself from a couple weeks ago.
