<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>We are building a lightweight ebpf kernel level firewall to effectively mitigate ddos, manage network congestion/latency. It works by throtlling packets per IP per second and also monitoring new connections and dropping if they are from bad actors. Also support ip blacklist, greylist and whitelist.</p> <p>This should be able to work with any existing firewall like nftables, iptables running on a linux kernel (version &gt; 5.1).</p> <p>The current offerings are:</p> <p>- Dyanmic Adaptive Kernel level packet rate limiter. Prevent DDoS.</p> <p>- Seamlessly integrate with existing firewalls and IDS/IPS</p> <p>- Ensure operational efficiency</p> <p>- Create global IP Whitelist, Blacklist and GreyList.</p> <p>- Redirect packets to different IP/interface</p> <p>- Build network traffic optimizer</p> <p>- Build optimal network load balancer</p> <p>- Block Bots and other bad traffic</p> <p>- Avert Cyber Attacks Efficiently</p> <p>If you would like to discuss,

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I recently took the PNTP exam, I feel kind of weird because I can&#39;t even get past the web part. What I don&#39;t understand is how I can&#39;t pass it. I had already done several machines ando some Red Team Labs of Vulnlab but I didn&#39;t even pass the web part. I do not understand if I was the one with the problem or something I did wrong. I also tried everything in the course for the web part.</p> <p>What can you tell me that I can study or what I should pay attention to in my next attempt. I am afraid of losing my second chance and having to pay again.</p> <p>And to add the supposed help from TCM for my second chance was telling me that the report is incomplete because I could not do the internal pentest and that it was wrong. I documented everything in the report and put absolutely everything I found and tried and they tell me that.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Impossible-Proof7355">
