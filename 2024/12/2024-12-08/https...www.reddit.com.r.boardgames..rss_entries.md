And the main reason for that is that 3 and a bit minutes are nowhere near enough time to go through the model and critique every single assumption it makes. And it&#39;s a lot. I am not a scrub when it comes to this sort of content either, I have a Masters Degree in Political Science and 15 years experience as a Government PR/Comms person handling NZ Government messaging. I&#39;m not even going to start taking the model down in the comments either because it would be an exhaustive and extensive post to make. </p> <p>I will say is that Hegemony presents &quot;a model&quot;, but it is one that is full of self fulfilling prophecies, based on the games own over-engineering its mechanics to force a Neo-liberal status quo onto the game.

I&#39;m curious about what campaign games are most flexible in regards to missing people. </p> <p>Specifically: it works well both on 4 and 5, someone missing a scenario doesn&#39;t significantly disadvantage them or mess up the story, the change number of players doesn&#39;t significantly change the gameplay for the other players, and there are a lot of scenarios, so missing 1 doesn&#39;t mean you missed like 20% of the game.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Tommyblockhead20"> /u/Tommyblockhead20 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1h9t9iy/campaign_gam

Sometimes it’d be three players, sometimes five, and the exact individuals would vary. Would this be a hindrance to the game play?</p> <p>I played pandemic legacy with some friends and we occasionally added an extra player - it was less desirable but was possible. So I guess I’m wondering two things - is it possible to change up number of players between rounds, and is it less fun/more difficult if the players themselves are different?

I’m hoping to buy a gift for my brother for Christmas and I was thinking about picking him up a copy of catan as he loves playing it with my wife and I. However, I realised that he wouldn’t ever really have anyone else to play this with so in effect I would just end up with 2 copies of catan haha! </p> <p>Could any of you recommend a similar style game that isn’t too complicated to learn? My brother definitely has a threshold for how many rules he can retain </p> <p>Thanks in advance :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Jetisphere"> /u/Jetisphere </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1h9gfdl/simple_to_learn_strategy_games/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1h9gfdl/simple_to_learn_strategy_games/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>For context, i have never played either game.</p> <p>I have been casually looking to pick up everdell on a sale, but always seem to miss it. Today i saw the everdell farshore essentials edition on sale for $25. I did a little research and they seem to be fairly similar, but i am wondering if i shoukd continue to wait on everdell or oull the tigger on this one.</p> <p>Which do you think is the better option? Thanks in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Xtrapeppers"> /u/Xtrapeppers </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1h962vp/everdell_or_everdell_farshore/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1h962vp/everdell_or_everdell_farshore/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>My family loves to play cooperative board games, but recently we have only had time for ones that take 1.5 hours or less, ideally 1 hour or less. When we had more time, we loved Arkham Horror. More recently we&#39;ve been playing a lot of Sentinels of the Multiverse and Crew.</p> <p>I&#39;d love some recs for games that are Co-Operative and short</p> <p>Edit: some additional info. We tend to really like deck building or engine building mechanics, which I think is why we&#39;ve been enjoying Sentinels so much</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ComprehensiveChef705"> /u/ComprehensiveChef705 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1h95vnb/short_cooperative_games/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1h95vnb/short_cooperative_games/">[comments]</a></span>
