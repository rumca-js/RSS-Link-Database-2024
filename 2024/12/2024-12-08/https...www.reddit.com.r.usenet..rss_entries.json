I wanted to give another provider on a different backbone a try and see if it made any difference. I decided to try something on Abavia backbone. The turbousenet BF deal seemed good, so I signed up for a year of unlimited.<br/> I did some testing with the same (2) newish/large-ish .nzb file (~90GB). On my Omicron provider I got 80MB/s and on the new turbousenet I got 48MB/s. I changed ports and number of connections (20,30,35,40,45,50) but could not get any faster on turbousenet.<br/> I put in a support ticket with turbousenet to ask if there was anything else I should try. They confirmed that there was nothing else I could try and nothing else they could do. I asked if a refund was possible as this would not support my needs. They agreed to provide a full refund and thanked me for trying their service.<br/> Overall good experience. I appreciate t",
