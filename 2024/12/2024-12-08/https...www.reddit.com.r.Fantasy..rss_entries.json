Terry Pratchett can do this, though I&#39;m not currently looking for comedy, and Becky Chambers can do this, though I&#39;m not currently looking for cosy novels that amplify the best in all of us to barely believable levels.</p> <p>What I&#39;m hoping for is books like The Curse of Chalion, where heroism is quiet and earned despite the cruelties of the world, where nobility of spirit shines despite mortal frailties and short comings. Books that don&#39;t pull their punches, but are written by authors one can trust implicitly to not write the dark moments for shock value or titillation. Authors with the thoughtful maturity and wisdom of Bujold and LeGuin. Beautifully written books like Circe, The Goblin Emperor, Hild, or The Ship Who Sang. B",

I didn\u2019t like it at all: it felt too long, and the only character who had significant development was Kaladin. The Shadesmar sections didn\u2019t click for me either. Still, the good parts were really good (Sanderson always delivers at the finales). All in all, I was a bit nervous about <em>Wind and Truth</em>. The stakes have been growing with each book, but I (and most of us, I think) don\u2019t read these books solely for the godlike fights (though I admit I do enjoy them); I read them for the characters and their journeys. Sanderson doesn\u2019t have the best prose\u2014he doesn\u2019t need it\u2014but I feared the mistakes of <em>RoW</em> would be repeated here. Fortunately, I was wrong.</p> <p>First of all, the pacing is fantastic. The start is a bit slow, but once it takes off, it doesn\u2019t stop at all. I literally couldn\u2019t put it down.

Something emotional that showcased their bond, you know? Instead, it felt like it was glossed over, and I\u2019m left wanting more. </p> <p>So now I\u2019m on the hunt for books that do focus on sibling relationships, particularly brothers, in a fantasy or supernatural setting.

I\u2019m getting my first tattoo right after the new year and was really wanting something dedicated to Between Two Fires by Christopher Buehlman since it\u2019s the book that me and my brother shared over a year ago now that reignited my passion for reading and became my favorite book of all time! I\u2019m thinking of getting the red and white version of the book cover (the one with the skeleton dressed in armor) but also considering some of my favorite scenes like the Archangel Michael coming in and battling towards the tail end of the story. I\u2019m open to any and all ideas, thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Due-Hat9692\"> /u/Due-Hat9692 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1h9hc93/between_two_fires_tattoo_ideas/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1h9hc93/between_two_fires_tattoo_ideas/\">[comments]</a></span>",

All she wants to do is read which is confusing to me\u2026 I was always forced to read growing up and never enjoyed it as a result. I want to read for entertainment too. </p> <p>Seeing her enjoy the series so much, I figured I\u2019d ask you for some recommendations based on my interests. I\u2019m a 28 year old male who loves working out, playing video games - MMORPGs in particular (warriors only, of course), and watching anime in my free time. I\u2019ve read a number of self-help books like The Power of Now, 48 Laws of Power, The Four Agreements, and several others. While I enjoyed the books, I felt like I was doing it to learn and often had to stick to a disciplined reading schedule to get through them.</p> <p>What would you recommend to start with? Are there any books that got you hooked on reading?</p> <p>Thanks in advance! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON",
