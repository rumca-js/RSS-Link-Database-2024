I printed miniatures on my FDM printer for the first time after buying the new game Battlefront Valkyrie from Fat Dragon Games. They're cool spaceships that were optimized for FDM (filament) printing, but it's a step in the right direction. We'll talk about the new future of the wargaming industry, and of course, I'll answer your wargaming questions. Come have fun!
