<p>While Cole Palmer brings brain, craft and invention, his Spanish teammate offers spirit and Main Character Energy</p><p>With 61 minutes gone at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, as Cole Palmer buried his first penalty kick of the game to make the score 2-2, Marc Cucurella could be seen banging himself violently in the head with both hands close to the left touchline, curls flying cinematically, like a loveable dog in an advert for floor&nbsp;detergent.</p><p>When Palmer scored his sublime top‑corner zinger against Southampton last week Cucurella had clenched his fists and howled, thrusting his hips pomp‑rock style.

<p>The good news is that it was better for Arsenal than last season.

And worse, they were denied an 89th-minute winner by a tight – but correct – offside call by the video assistant referee.</p><p>Liverpool may feel, with six players out injured and Everton having put four past Wolves on Wednesday, that the postponement of Saturday’s Merseyside derby provided a welcome break before the rigours of the festive programme. However, it also gave Arsenal the opportunity to cut the gap to four which, even having played a game more, does not seem anywhere near as daunting as seven. As it is, the gap is six points and Liverpool have a game in hand. Everything at the moment is coming up Arne Slot.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/dec/08/fulham-arsenal-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

Philip Oakey’s voice remains rich and pristine and it immediately sets the tone for an evening of immaculate electro pop music delivered with grace, precision and elation.</p><p>Despite once being regarded as the epitome of synth-washed futurism, tracks such as Mirror Man are a beautiful example of the group’s clear love of the 1960s, with its unquestionable Motown strut being spun into slick electronic soul and with Oakey’s voice working in seamless harmony with those of Susan Ann Sulley and Joanne Catherall.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/dec/08/the-human-le

The former North Shields barman’s deeply personal themes – such as Seventeen Going Under’s raging line about the benefits system (“I see my mother/the DWP see a number”) – are made universal by fantastic, epic songs, passionately delivered by what could be a geordie version of Bruce Springsteen’s E Street Band.</p><p>The chilling Dead Boys, about male suicide, makes a brilliantly unlikely arena opener, but Fender is previewing third album Pe

<p>The photographer’s 1980s shot of a punter and his dog shows a London destination already in thrall to its storied past</p><p>The market at Camden Lock in north London has for 50 years been trading in trends and nostalgia. Near the site of the horse hospital that once cared for animals pulling canal barges, the modern market was established with 16 stalls in 1974 and soon became – knocking off styles from Kings Road – the primary home of London’s punk counterculture. Ever since, regulars and traders have informed newcomers and tourists that the market is not what it was. When Tony Kearns took this picture at a handbag stall at the market in 1989, Camden was already selling past images of itself. The bulldog on the punter’s shoulder captures that mood well: Camden has seen it all before.</p><p>Kearns, inspired by the great street photographers Robert Doisneau, Josef Koudelka and Mary Ellen Mark, spent a lot of time between 1987 and 1994 touring London markets looking for characters

<p>Peter Sarsgaard’s calm authority has brought depth to a huge range of roles, from Dopesick to Batman. He talks about his dismay at Trump’s victory, trying to do the right thing, and raising his daughters with Maggie Gyllenhaal</p><p>Peter Sarsgaard appears on Zoom as he often does on film: quiet, soft-spoken, gentle poise concealing grave thoughts within. Now 53, he has been an actor for three decades, a star of independent films and big-money Hollywood productions in which he tends to depict men with ulterior motives – men who are not what they seem at first. As we talk online, he is sitting in the offices of Paramount Pictures, in New York, appearing chill – dark suit, white shirt open at the collar, silver rings in each ear – only to suddenly cackle pleasantly at a dark thought. “Face-value people are pretty tough,” he says, of character parts he prefers to turn down. “Like, <em>straightforward</em>.”<em> </em>He pauses. “Sincerity is difficult to play.”</p><p>Sarsgaard will so

<p>With illiberal regimes advancing across the globe, youthful voters are standing up to make their voices heard</p><p>It has been a testing week for democracy across Europe and Asia. But the good news is that, by and large, countries that trust the people to decide who governs them are weathering the storm. This outcome is by no means final or certain, nor can it be in an era when authoritarian, dictatorial and illiberal regimes are advancing. It is now commonplace, indeed normal, for democratic electoral processes to be subverted, disrupted and disputed from within and by external forces using clandestine, hybrid methods. The latest upheavals also come amid signs of regression in the US, the country most closely identified with democratic rights and freedoms.</p><p>A video of a young South Korean woman <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/05/south-korean-woman-who-grabbed-soldiers-gun-says-i-just-needed-to-stop-them">seizing the barrel of a soldier’s rifle</a> during

<p>Wearing blush that starts from the high end of the cheekbone is a clever way to bring warmth into your face</p><p>Increasingly, I’ve noticed many people (OK, many people on social media, on the catwalk and everywhere other than in real life) wearing blush that starts from the very high end of the cheekbone – close to the side of the eyes – and then curves round to the bottom of the cheek. If you’ve always just placed your blush on the apples of your cheeks this might feel ambitious. But try it. It’s a clever way to bring warmth into your face. Which in the dead of winter is no bad thing.</p><p><strong>1.

<p>Something sweetly suitable to sip over Christmas </p><p><strong>Tesco Finest LBV Port, Douro, Portugal 2017 (£13.50, <a href="https://www.tesco.com/">Tesco</a>) </strong>Such is the strength of its association with that most festive of cheeses, stilton, Port, I suspect, remains <em>the </em>Christmas fortified wine for a vast majority of people. It’s a position I agree with to the extent that I can’t imagine being without a bottle or two at this time of year, even as I would argue that this great Portuguese wine can be every bit as wonderful well after the decorations have come down. The choice this year could come from the following bottles, starting with two own-label staples: the dark, brambly berry and black-cherry-rich Late Bottled Vintage style made for Tesco by the reliable British shippers, Symington Family Estates, and the softer, dried fruit, and fresh-packet-of-muscovado sugar stylings of the wood-aged M&amp;S 10 Year Old Tawny Port NV (£20) made for M&amp;S by Taylor’s

It has a narrow exterior of black brick. There is something eager about the window display: multiple menus, some with pictures of food; a shelf with emptied bottles of Japanese liquor, as if to say that good times have been had here. For a while there was a TV screen in the window showing cuts of beef and later a chiller cabinet, filled with slabs of animal. The small dining room doesn’t look like much either: walls clad in fake brick and hung with cartoony images of animals indicating their various cuts; wide
