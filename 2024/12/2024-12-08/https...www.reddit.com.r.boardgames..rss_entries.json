They don\u2019t really enjoy the game play with just two players, so they\u2019ll play whenever their kids are in town. I\u2019d love to get them Ticket to Ride Legends of the West, but they wouldn\u2019t be playing with a regular, consistent group. Sometimes it\u2019d be three players, sometimes five, and the exact individuals would vary. Would this be a hindrance to the game play?</p> <p>I played pandemic legacy with some friends and we occasionally added an extra player - it was less desirable but was possible. So I guess I\u2019m wondering two things - is it possible to change up number of players between rounds, and is it less fun/more difficult if the players themselves are different?

I started thinking how that would be possible and realised that you would probably need to use this special ability more than once per round. However, in my group, we thought that I am allowed to use it only once per round and thus generate only one QIC, as the background of this special action on Bal T&#39;aks&#39; board is a bright orange - the same as on various bonus actions you can take only once per round.
