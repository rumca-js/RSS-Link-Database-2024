## Looking for wise and uplifting novels

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>There are different fantasy books for all seasons, and I currently find myself in need of books written by wise, benevolent, thoughtful authors that re-instill one&#39;s faith in the innate goodness of humanity. Terry Pratchett can do this, though I&#39;m not currently looking for comedy, and Becky Chambers can do this, though I&#39;m not currently looking for cosy novels that amplify the best in all of us to barely believable levels.</p> <p>What I&#39;m hoping for is books like The Curse of Chalion, where heroism is quiet and earned despite the cruelties of the world, where nobility of spirit shines despite mortal frailties and short comings. Books that don&#39;t pull their punches, but are written by authors one can trust implicitly to not write the dark moments for shock value or titillation. Authors with the thoughtful maturity and wisdom of Bujold and LeGuin. Beautifully written books like Circe, The Goblin Emperor, Hild, or The Ship Who Sang. B

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I know this might sound weird, but please bear with me!</p> <p>So, I started out reading romantasy (fantasy romance), but discovered that a lot of it is more just focusing on the romantic relationship and sex than external plot, which I don&#39;t really like. I like romance in a story, but not at the expense of an external plot.</p> <p>Some people have suggested to me I might prefer &quot;regular&quot; fantasy more, so I&#39;m open to trying it.</p> <p>The thing is, I associate &quot;regular&quot; fantasy with stoic characters, highly triggering content like torture, rape and gore, and very little drama or delving into interpersonal relationships, which I don&#39;t like, so I&#39;m afraid of picking up just any random book.</p> <p>I like having an external plot with a good plot structure in place (even better if there is a romance subplot), with some horror and mystery if possible, but I also don&#39;t want to be grossed out with body horror, torture

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I was worried about the direction <em>The Stormlight Archive</em> had taken after <em>Rhythm of War</em>. I didn’t like it at all: it felt too long, and the only character who had significant development was Kaladin. The Shadesmar sections didn’t click for me either. Still, the good parts were really good (Sanderson always delivers at the finales). All in all, I was a bit nervous about <em>Wind and Truth</em>. The stakes have been growing with each book, but I (and most of us, I think) don’t read these books solely for the godlike fights (though I admit I do enjoy them); I read them for the characters and their journeys. Sanderson doesn’t have the best prose—he doesn’t need it—but I feared the mistakes of <em>RoW</em> would be repeated here. Fortunately, I was wrong.</p> <p>First of all, the pacing is fantastic. The start is a bit slow, but once it takes off, it doesn’t stop at all. I literally couldn’t put it down. This was my main issue with <em>Ro

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone! </p> <p>I just finished <em>Night Play</em> from Sherrilyn Kenyon’s Were-Hunters series, and while I enjoyed parts of it, I found myself disappointed with how the relationship between the three brothers—Fang, Fury, and Vane—was handled. Their bond was the main reason I kept reading! But when Fang finally woke up after everything he went through, the moment was so rushed. No deep emotions, no exploration of his connection with his brothers, and he just… left with Aimee. </p> <p>I get that romance is a big focus of the series, but I would have loved to see more about the brothers helping Fang through his struggles or even him stepping up when Vane or Fury was in danger. Something emotional that showcased their bond, you know? Instead, it felt like it was glossed over, and I’m left wanting more. </p> <p>So now I’m on the hunt for books that do focus on sibling relationships, particularly brothers, in a fantasy or supernatural setting.

I’m getting my first tattoo right after the new year and was really wanting something dedicated to Between Two Fires by Christopher Buehlman since it’s the book that me and my brother shared over a year ago now that reignited my passion for reading and became my favorite book of all time! I’m thinking of getting the red and white version of the book cover (the one with the skeleton dressed in armor) but also considering some of my favorite scenes like the Archangel Michael coming in and battling towards the tail end of the story. I’m open to any and all ideas, thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Due-Hat9692"> /u/Due-Hat9692 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1h9hc93/between_two_fires_tattoo_ideas/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1h9hc93/between_two_fires_tattoo_ideas/">[comments]</a></span>

I came from a small village surrounded by dense forests, where my world had been reduced to the same paths, the same faces, and the stories in the books that came into my hands. Those tales of fearless heroes facing dreadful threats had fueled my dreams since childhood, and although I could not see myself as a hero in any way, something within me always urged me to explore beyond.</p> <p>As a child, I devoured books of all kinds: from ancient history treatises to texts about the mysteries of magic. In them, I found something my daily life could not offer: the promise of the unknown, of something greater. Among the many stories I read, one of the most impressive was about a great calamity that had shaken the world&#39;s foundations long, long ago. This had been documented in histo

Normally I would go to <a href="/r/progression_fantasy">r/progression_fantasy</a> but this is kinda the opposite of that.</p> <p>I&#39;d like some books where a character from a fantasy setting (a wizard, preferably), comes out of their secluded research to find the world has changed, and goes out to explore it and find new things. It could be that they&#39;ve been in seclusion for so long that the world has drastically changed around them, or they were somehow transported to another world and that breaks their focus on their research, whatever. Could be generic fantasy, xianxia, so long as the main character actually understands how their abilities work and spends their time trying to understand the new world they&#39;ve found themselves in.</p> <p>Thank you for your cooperation.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/use

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’m about to start the third book in this trilogy. The first two are The Final Strife and The Battle Drum by Saara El-Arifi. I love this series and think it’s such a strong plot with excellent writing. Not to mention queer with Afro-Arab mythology and characters! We love.</p> <p>But I find the other romantic interest SO annoying. I think this is one of the pitfalls with writing multi dimensional and thoughtful characters — Anoor is so well developed that I hate her. She’s spoiled, naive, not that smart, superficial, indulgent, weak (in some ways), quick to accuse friends of wrongdoing, disloyal, demanding. She just accepts what she’s told. Most of her plot line has been her riding on the tails of other people’s strength and legacy, just desperate for attention and love. </p> <p>I think it would be realistic for the Sylah (who is in love with anoor somehow) to be interested in and attracted to other people. But even slight hints of that lead to Sylah
