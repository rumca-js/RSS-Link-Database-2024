Southern and it was delightful and made my recent purchase of a Kobo Libra 2 well worth it alone.</p> <p>I recently also wanted to learn a little bit about gardening and found the Square Foot Gardening book and am enjoying the idea of being able to learn fundamentals in an easy to digest way.</p> <p>I am just curious if there are any other great introductory books to various topics whether it&#39;d be considered the bible of a specific field of study or just a niche part of history/science or even hobby book. I keep having this lull in life where I crave intensely learning more but have no idea what to learn and where to go (like I imagine quite a lot of people have deep inside).

Basically anything that is &#39;true&#39; or things that happened if that makes sense, or even anything about theories (conspiracies included I guess!) Last year he went for Neil Gaiman Norse Mythology and the similar Steven Fry ones too. He&#39;s in to the World wars and Chernobyl and things like that also. World events I guess A few years ago he was reading Michael Crichtons Jurassic Park (one of his fave childhood film collection!) and liked that the films came from this, although the books are obviously different.

Luckily yesterday someone was extremely kind and gave me some books that he doesn&#39;t need anymore from his collection. Now I found myself in a small dilemma which is what book to start with, I&#39;m a little afraid that if I start with a title that isn&#39;t much interesting I&#39;ll end up quitting half way. So I&#39;ve listed below the titles, and I&#39;d appreciate any suggestions or opinions regarding them.</p> <p>Titles: </p> <p>Great Expectations by Charles Dickens</p> <p>The Ruby Airship by Sharon Gosling</p> <p>Saving Faith by David Baldacci</p> <p>The Escape by David Baldacci</p> <p>End Game by David Baldacci</p> <p>The Mysterious Affair At Styles by Agatha Christie</p> <p>The murder Of Roger Ackroyd by Agatha Christie</p> <p>The Murder On The Orient Express by Agatha Christie </p> <p>The ABC Murders by Agatha Christie</p> ",

Interested in reading more about the culture and lifestyle during that time period. Books don\u2019t need to cover the entire period, they can cover any scope or topic within that period really. </p></li> <li><p>Hollywood history. Again this can be something that covers the span of hollywoods history, it can focus on a certain period, it can be about the \u2018dark side of Hollywood\u2019, anything you found interesting. </p></li> <li><p>Finally books about music in the country, again kind of between that 40s/50s-60s period but if there\u2019s anything later you found interesting please leave it in the comments. </p></li> </ol> <p>I appreciate that\u2019s all quite vague and open but please, if you\u2019ve read something interesting that fits one of those requests even loosely leave it below I",
