Using Arduino IDE or ESPhome for my future projects is the question. I know how to program in C++, and initially, I was rejected by YAML, the “programming language” of ESPhome, because it looked very strange. It took me some time to understand the difference. Time you can save if you stick with me to the end. One thing I can promise: It is a lot of fun if you get the hang of it.
