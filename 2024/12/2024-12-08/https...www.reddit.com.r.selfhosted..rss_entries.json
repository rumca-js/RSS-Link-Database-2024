However, I noticed that my small server (HP Prodesk with Proxmox) was running too hot some days and had some power spikes (100W vs 30w at normal time). I didn&#39;t see anything wrong in the logs, so I restarted the server and waited one more day..Same issue.</p> <p>Then i watched the Cloudflare traffic and I understood where this was coming from. I got 1000+/day connections from bots and IPs all over the world. </p> <p>So I decided to go for Whitelist IP in WAF module.

I guess it&#39;s a sort of gallery, but I only ever built self-hosted wordpress sites. I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s the best tool for this job.<br/> I remember a website where people can post intimate pictures of them, with some sort of timer and as long as people would add time on the timer, the picture would stay up. I think it&#39;s a feature I&#39;d like as well. </p> <p>Can anyone put me on the right track by suggesting a CMS or another self-hosted solution that can carry the project with as little hassle and headaches as possible?</p> <p>If another man would like to join in on the project, I would appreciate ha",
