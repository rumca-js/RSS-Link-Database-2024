With my current set-up even with ASW always on @ 120 fps, with VD vr resolution set to medium it still maxes out at around 90-120% resoltion according to

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve tried playing Minecraft VR using Vivecraft and it is insanely cool. However, once I got past the awe of just how big everything is (and how short I am compared to Steve), I got tired of how much slower it is to do anything (especially building) and having to physically look up/down for extended periods of times when placing lots of blocks just isn&#39;t very ergonomic. I also suck at aiming with my face.</p> <p>With that said, all I want for Christmas is &quot;VR&quot; Minecraft where the ONLY difference from regular (Java) Minecraft is that instead of displaying the game on my monitor, it is displayed on my headset, in 3D, and strapped to my face. No head or hand tracking, no 3D menus, etc... Maybe the FOV would need to be adjusted a bit to look correct but that&#39;s about it. This seems like something that should be really easy to do (and probably exists) but I can&#39;t find a decent solution and am not good enough at modding / software

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone,</p> <p>I&#39;m conducting research on VR applications and games that incorporate <strong>transportation methods</strong> for movement. This could include anything from traditional vehicles like cars, boats, or planes to more unique options like cable cars, gliders, zip lines, or even culturally inspired transport like rickshaws, carriages, or sedan chairs.</p> <p>I&#39;m curious about:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Recommendations</strong>: What are some great VR applications or games that creatively use these transportation methods for locomotion?</li> <li><strong>User Experience</strong>: Have you experienced any challenges with such locomotion methods in VR (e.g., motion sickness, lack of immersion)?</li> <li><strong>Hidden Gems</strong>: Are there any lesser-known VR titles or projects with unique transport systems that you’d recommend?</li> </ol> <p>I’m particularly interested in how these methods impact immersion, usability, and enjoyment.

I do kind of eye the RTX 5*** series launch so might opt for new GPU in first half of new year, but meantime thought to get VR ready and start to get &quot;VR legs&quot;.</p> <p>In this case, would you recommend Quest 3 over other options? Games I would be interested in playing are stuff like Skyrim and Fallout VR, blade and sorcery looks interesting but mainly MSFS. I do however believe MSFS might not be possible, I have heard and read that 3060TI for VR is far too low so not really putting hopes on this before getting a better GPU and CPU most likely.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So like I’ve seen from several others I was duped into buying the vive focus vision and honest the thing is pretty damn awful in just about every respect. Bought as prerelease, turned on once, then threw it in the corner in disgust (where it remains) and grabbed my quest 3.</p> <p>Now a couple months later I still want the upgrade I promised myself. </p> <p>I haven’t had an exclusive pcvr headset since my og rift and have not kept up on this stuff at all. All I know is there are several new players like pico and recently big screen. </p> <p>What’s the current baddest headset that’s not priced for commercial applications?</p> <p>For a budget reference I would not absolutely not spend $10k, would for sure spend up to $2k and would probably talk myself into $3k if there was some god tier headset miles above the rest. </p> <p>I play mostly shooters and sword games. </p> <p>I also just build a beast of a PC for VR so will be able to run anything. </p> </d
