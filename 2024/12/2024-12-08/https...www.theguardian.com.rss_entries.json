My dad called at 10am to say my mother had fallen while out running, hit her head and was now in hospital with a suspected brain bleed.

But the good news is that, by and large, countries that trust the people to decide who governs them are weathering the storm. This outcome is by no means final or certain, nor can it be in an era when authoritarian, dictatorial and illiberal regimes are advancing. It is now commonplace, indeed normal, for democratic electoral processes to be subverted, disrupted and disputed from within and by external forces using clandestine, hybrid methods.
