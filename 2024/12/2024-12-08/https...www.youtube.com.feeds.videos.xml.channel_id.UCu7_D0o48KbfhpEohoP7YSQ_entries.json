        "description": "Using Arduino IDE or ESPhome for my future projects is the question. I know how to program in C++, and initially, I was rejected by YAML, the \u201cprogramming language\u201d of ESPhome, because it looked very strange. It took me some time to understand the difference. Time you can save if you stick with me to the end. One thing I can promise: It is a lot of fun if you get the hang of it.\n\nMy second channel: https://www.youtube.com/HB9BLAWireless\n\nLinks:\n3.3 and 5V LEDs: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DB85Ebf\nI2C PCB: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DlPfTgd\n\nPatreon supporter companies:\nhttps://www.welectron.com/\n\nThe links above are usually affiliate links that support the channel (at no additional cost to you).\nSupporting Material and Blog Page: http://www.sensorsiot.org\nGitHub: https://www.github.com/sensorsiot\nMy Patreon Page: https://www.patreon.com/AndreasSpiess\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/JfgDSa8\nIf you want to support the channel, please use the links below to start your shopping.",
