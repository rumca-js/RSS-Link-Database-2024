<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am soon to start a PhD in Engineering and I am considering the possibility of signing up to ChatGPT Plus. I think the o1 model could be useful for its mathematical capabilities. Plus the advanced voice mode could be handy for language learning, doing logs, etc. (for the time being, no other company offers like OpenAI does). </p> <p>Would you say signing up for it is a good strategy, or should I look into local open-source models and APIs? If local models are the way to go, where should I start looking into?
