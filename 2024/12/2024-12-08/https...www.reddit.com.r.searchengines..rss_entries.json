It&#39;s AI answers are also quite good. And undoubtedly it&#39;s image results are best among all. On the other hand, Bing also provides good results on specific topics. It&#39;s quite helpful while researching on specific topics (also academic). But it&#39;s image results are not as good as Google imo. Still it&#39;s good in its own way.
