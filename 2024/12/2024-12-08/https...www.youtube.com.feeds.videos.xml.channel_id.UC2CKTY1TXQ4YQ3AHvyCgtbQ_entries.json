        "description": "I printed miniatures on my FDM printer for the first time after buying the new game Battlefront Valkyrie from Fat Dragon Games. They're cool spaceships that were optimized for FDM (filament) printing, but it's a step in the right direction. We'll talk about the new future of the wargaming industry, and of course, I'll answer your wargaming questions. Come have fun! \n\nVince Venturella and I made another game! Check out Deth Wizards - miniatures-agnostic necromantic skirmish combat at http://www.dethwizardsgame.com\n\nI'm a member of The Army Painter Factory Team - and I'm passing the savings on to you!

I paint minis every Friday morning and Monday night, and sometimes take paint breaks (play video games poorly). Follow me: http://www.twitch.tv/tabletopminions\n\nOffic",
