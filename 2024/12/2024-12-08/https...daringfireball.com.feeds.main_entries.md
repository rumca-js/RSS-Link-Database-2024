<p>Mark Gurman, in his Power On column for Bloomberg:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple is now working on a major effort to support third-party hand
controllers in the device’s visionOS software and has teamed up
with Sony Group Corp. to make it happen. Apple approached Sony
earlier this year, and the duo agreed to work together on
launching support for the PlayStation VR2’s hand controllers on
the Vision Pro. Inside Sony, the work has been a monthslong
undertaking, I’m told. And Apple has discussed the plan with
third-party developers, asking them if they’d integrate support
into their games. [...]</p>

<p>One hiccup is that Sony doesn’t currently sell its VR hand
controllers as a standalone accessory. The company would need to
decouple the equipment from its own headset and kick off
operations to produce and ship the accessory on its own. As part
of the arrangement, Sony would sell the controllers at Apple’s
online and retail stores, which already offer PS5 versions.</p>
