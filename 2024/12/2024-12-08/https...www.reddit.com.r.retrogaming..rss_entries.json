The games were fun and often hard as balls, many played like very old computer or Atari 2600/arcade or something despite their nicer than those but retro for the time and especially nowadays standards graphics. I no longer have the disc, maybe it was called Way 2 Cool Arcade for Windows 3.1 or something. The disc had a silver and black zebra look with purple or green text on it. Very 90s and super dated looking disc. </p> <p>It must have had at least a 100 games on it. Some games I remember and even managed to download somewhere and thanks to Wine, I managed to get working on my modern laptop. But others I do not remember the name only vague memories. </p> <p>Games like Quenzar&#39;s Caverns, Winroids, and especially Comet Busters. </p>",
