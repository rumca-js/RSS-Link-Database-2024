<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>When I was a kid, I had this disc that contained a bunch of Windows 3.1 games that I played on the Windows 98 dad&#39;s living room family computer and later a Windows 98 (eventually Windows 2000 or NT) in my bedroom. The games were fun and often hard as balls, many played like very old computer or Atari 2600/arcade or something despite their nicer than those but retro for the time and especially nowadays standards graphics. I no longer have the disc, maybe it was called Way 2 Cool Arcade for Windows 3.1 or something. The disc had a silver and black zebra look with purple or green text on it. Very 90s and super dated looking disc. </p> <p>It must have had at least a 100 games on it. Some games I remember and even managed to download somewhere and thanks to Wine, I managed to get working on my modern laptop. But others I do not remember the name only vague memories. </p> <p>Games like Quenzar&#39;s Caverns, Winroids, and especially Comet Busters. </p>

I&#39;m trying to remember what is the name of a driving video game for Windows 98, I think it came out in 95/96. I remember that the track sometimes had loop of death (the ones from Sonic the Hedgehog, to be clear). Among the cars you could drive, some were prototypes similar to dragsters, with a very streamlined shape. The cockpit view was quite realistic for the time, but the steering wheel did not turn when steering. It had a ridicolous bug, when you decided to do the track in the opposite direction (just for fun), the bots would go crazy and start driving like they were on LSD. </p> <p>A friend of mine had it on a Packard Bell pc</p> <p>Any help?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Locust_Nexus"> /u/Locust_Nexus </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1h9j4rn/help_90s_win98_driving_video_game/

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Basically I was having a moment of observation to look at the system itself for its failure as when it came out, it flopped quite hard in the west, like real hard, and it got me wondering how the idea of virtual reality gaming could have succeeded as a concept.</p> <p>Like when I take a closer look at the system for again its failure status, I wonder where the idea went wrong to begin with as what surprises me the most about the console is that even though it was a Nintendo based system, it still flopped hard compared to the company’s previous hardware at the time.</p> <p>So I ask myself why the console failed as I would like to know where Nintendo messed up in the concept of a console designed for virtual reality as everyone mocks the system (e.g AVGN) that it fascinates me to look at its flaws so that I can see what the problem was to begin with.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/KaleidoArachnid"
