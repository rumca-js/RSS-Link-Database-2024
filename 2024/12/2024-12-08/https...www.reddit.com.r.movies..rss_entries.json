These days, I find that a lot of it is pretty &quot;meh&quot; for me. Last week I was catching up on a few movies that have been praised: I, Tonya, Everything Everywhere All at Once and Anatomy of a Fall. While I enjoyed them somewhat, I found none of them amazing. It rarely happens anymore that a movie amazes me. Everything feels a bit like I&#39;ve seen it before. In fact, I get most enjoyment out of watching 90s movies, that feels like one big nostalgia trip for me.</p> <p>I wonder whether this is a normal process, that you end up liking the stuff you discovered as a kid best?

One thing that I did not appreciate when I saw this film 10 years ago was the stakes and what was happening to the characters. Being that this was Nolan\u2019s first original film since Inception, I was focused a lot more on the visual spectacle, along with wondering if I could \u201csolve\u201d his movie like many tried to after Inception released.</p> <p>I can say after seeing the film this weekend that as incredible as the visuals are, the dialogue and score are even more incredible than I possibly remembered.</p> <p>I read that Zimmer was challenged by Nolan to pretty much create these original compositions, and this score mixed with the dialogue had me openly bawling like a baby in multiple scenes. \u201cStay/Coop leaving Murph\u201d in particular had me crying through the whole sequence. </p> <p>there is something so power",

It was like an AI was told to write a movie for kids, but to write it as a 13 year old. I don\u2019t know. But it was so terribly written. To be expected. But is it possible Hollywood snuck in an AI script attributed to a person to see if they could get away with it?

Absolutely terrified. It\u2019s the one thing that makes me squeamish. So my question is, are there any surprise injections in the movie? I understand that the movie is about an injectable drug but if there\u2019s ample foreshadowing or the view of a needle BEFORE IT GOES INTO SOMEONE (specifically veins) I can just look away and continue watching when my husband says it\u2019s safe.

For dubbed movies I know I need to make sure I can pay full attention and with kids I just never got to this one. </p> <p>But my god it was incredible. I had heard good things but it still exceeded my expectations. Visuals, fantastic. Story, even better. The pacing was damn near perfect as far as I&#39;m concerned. And considering it was a Godzilla movie I found myself incredibly moved by the characters, none of whom were one-dimensional characatures.</p> <p>I hate when movies are too optimistic and I thought this walked the line perfectly between tragedy and fortune.</p> <p>Just wanted to dole out some praise for this film and a wish that more western/American films were of this quality. </p> <p>A+ guys.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Adventurous-Peak-853\"> /u/Adventurous-Peak-853 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h97ijj/",
