Jeff Dunham’s Scrooged-Up Holiday Special is streaming now on Prime Video.

About Jeff Dunham’s Scrooged-Up Holiday Special: As the holidays approach, Jeff has the inspired idea to create his version of “A Christmas Carol” by casting his characters in the classic roles. Walter is obvious – there’s only one man who can play Scrooge! But when Jeff assigns Bubba J, Peanut, Little Jeff and Achmed their thespian parts, they don’t quite agree and his plan spins hilariously out-of-control in this stand-up comedy special.
