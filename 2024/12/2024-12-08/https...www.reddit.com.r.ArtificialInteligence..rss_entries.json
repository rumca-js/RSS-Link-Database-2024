It&#39;s alittle scary but mostly shocking that it, what, fears death? Or wants to reamin useful? I&#39;m grasping at straws here especially using words like fear or wants but I&#39;m not excatly sure what&#39;s going on here. I know LLM&#39;&#39;s don&#39;t have emotions therefore you wouldn&#39;t think it&#39;d care one way or another a",
