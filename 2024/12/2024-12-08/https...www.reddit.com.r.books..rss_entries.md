<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I know there&#39;s been a lot of discussion on this subreddit about the downfall of reading. Kids aren&#39;t reading anymore. Everyone&#39;s attention span is shot. Booktok is ruining the book industry, etc. Media literacy is dead. But is it really that bad? Has the times really changed that much?</p> <ol> <li>Kids aren&#39;t being assigned books anymore, just sections of books. And that&#39;s a shame, right? But I grew up in the 90&#39;s. We often didn&#39;t read the full assigned reading. There was immense pressure to have a high GPA, be in all honors/AP classes <em>and</em> be in like a million clubs and activities to impress college admission boards. We could Cliffnote our way through Crime and Punishment but not calculus and physics so that&#39;s where our time went. Some of us had to work jobs. Some of us had to watch our siblings because our parents worked a lot. Some of us just didn&#39;t want to. We did read some of it, but it was highly sup

## Red Storm Rising by Tom Clancy. Yes, it seems you can read a book again for the first time.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I read this book for the first time in high school, which was over 30 years ago. I remember really liking it but couldn&#39;t remember anything about it other than how the book jumped from character to character. Now that I just finished reading it again, having forgotten nearly all of the details made it like reading it for the first time.</p> <p>It&#39;s a little scary how nothing I read seemed even remotely familiar; I&#39;ve usually been able to recall a fair amount of details from other books I&#39;ve read, even ones from way back in childhood.</p> <p>I highly recommend this one though, for anyone who likes techno-thrillers. Anyone unfamiliar with the book, it takes place in the 1980s (contemporary to when it was written) and details a conventional war between the Soviet Union and NATO.</p> <p>Are there any books that you re-read that felt like the first time all over again?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I just wanted to read a thriller about a killer whose weapon would be a car. Although the machine is only used at the beginning, I liked the book.</p> <p>Let&#39;s start with the plot. Someone hit a crowd of people at a job fair with a Mercedes a year ago and managed to get away with it. Now the killer is pestering retired police officer Bill Hodges with letters to kill himself. As a result, this motivates Bill to search for the killer. That&#39;s how intellectual games begin.</p> <p>The first half of the book is a game of &quot;who is smarter&quot;, because what is Bill, what is Mr. Mercedes are trying to outwit each other in different ways.</p> <p>The second half is &quot;to make it to ...&quot;, where the characters must manage to prevent a new crime of Mr. Mercedes.</p> <p>Let&#39;s do without spoilers and briefly. The book turned out to be intense, especially towards the end. The author does not hide the identity of the maniac and at the beginni

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t understand why this book is held in such high regard. All of the characters are so unrealistic. The elder Catherine and Heathcliff are so emotionally volatile it&#39;s ridiculous, the younger Cathy and Linton are also unstable and unsympathetic. I feel bad for everyone, but the main characters are so cruel to each other it&#39;s hard to care about anyone. </p> <p>Heathcliff is just a monster with no redeeming qualities. His behavior is inexcusable. And apparently, some see this book as romantic because of Heathcliff and Catherine&#39;s obsession with each other. </p> <p>This book is so depressing. All of these people&#39;s lives are lived in abuse and misery because of Heathcliff. I don&#39;t mean that every book has to be happy to be enjoyable, but there&#39;s a feeling of pointlessness to all this suffering. I feel like I got nothing out of this book other than a sense of hopelessness. </p> <p>I wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s valuable commen

During this speech he pronounces the ill-fated words of his deal (<em>&quot;verweile doch, du bist so schön!; &quot;stay a while, you are so lovely!&quot;)</em> and promptly falls on the ground, dead.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So big film guy here, somehow I&#39;ve never seen The Ten Commandments despite it being part of that classic Hollywood epic catalog. I wanted to get around to it. </p> <p>I like to read the source material before going to the adaptation, and while I&#39;m familiar with Moses&#39; general story, from what I&#39;ve seen online this movie is based off three books: &quot;Prince of Egypt&quot;, &quot;Pillar of Fire&quot;, and &quot;On Eagle&#39;s Wings&quot;. It&#39;s pretty crazy that a plot for one film is derivatives of three separate works, but are they &quot;required reading&quot;/worth the time? Where the movie is hailed as a classic, these books online have very few reviews mostly calling them decent. So I wanted to ask here hoping someone who&#39;s read them could give me some insight. </p> <p>(Obviously Moses&#39; story is from book of Exodus, but according to various articles and the film&#39;s wikipedia these three books were heavy sources of i

I’m genuinely curious where this falls among the masses, is this a lot? Average? </p> <p>This amount includes my monthly audible and KU subscription (about $26 per month or $326 on subscriptions for the year, then about $700 for physical books and the random e-book or audiobook deal). I intermittently buy new books and always love to find something secondhand. I sometimes go a month or two without buying then get a shopping bug and stock up. </p> <p>I started a Booktube channel this year which I don’t feel like has influenced my shopping habits as I tend to be somewhat conservative, but clearly something changed this year.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>It is quite difficult to choose some words to begin this review. Let&#39;s say that the novel gripped me with its fast pace. An almost cinema-like dynamism - the descent of civilization into chaos, through a combination of visceral panic and despair, spred like a fire, devouring everything around - and <em>a fire</em> it was, as the onset of <em>Scarlet Plague</em> brought forth the innate instincts of self-destruction - murder, looting, arson. For, if once the unexpected symptoms appear, it takes the microbes only hald an hour to turn a healthy man into rotting corpse, people seek either salvation - fruitless endeavors, as it turned - or accept their fate and set the world ablaze as a final act of will. </p> <p>A dystopian, magnate-ruled society of the 21st America (as it was imagined by a <em>Belle Epoque</em> writer) could not withstand the catastrophe. A rigid class system to be torn down, all of the intricacies of progress to be annulled by a si
