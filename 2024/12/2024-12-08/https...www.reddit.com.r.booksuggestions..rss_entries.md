<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello, I recently was wanting to learn more about history and found the book &quot;The Making of the Middle Ages&quot; by R. W. Southern and it was delightful and made my recent purchase of a Kobo Libra 2 well worth it alone.</p> <p>I recently also wanted to learn a little bit about gardening and found the Square Foot Gardening book and am enjoying the idea of being able to learn fundamentals in an easy to digest way.</p> <p>I am just curious if there are any other great introductory books to various topics whether it&#39;d be considered the bible of a specific field of study or just a niche part of history/science or even hobby book. I keep having this lull in life where I crave intensely learning more but have no idea what to learn and where to go (like I imagine quite a lot of people have deep inside). So suggestions would be lovely if you have any!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Anthony_Writ

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi! </p> <p>Just looking for recommendations for my very nearly 17 year old. He&#39;s very science minded (really good at maths, physics, mechanics etc) but in to history and factual things also. Basically anything that is &#39;true&#39; or things that happened if that makes sense, or even anything about theories (conspiracies included I guess!) Last year he went for Neil Gaiman Norse Mythology and the similar Steven Fry ones too. He&#39;s in to the World wars and Chernobyl and things like that also. World events I guess A few years ago he was reading Michael Crichtons Jurassic Park (one of his fave childhood film collection!) and liked that the films came from this, although the books are obviously different. Also likes Hunger Games and things like that going down the film route </p> <p>Any suggestions appreciated.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>My friend is trying to get their sci-fi/western novel published. This is NOT a self-promotion or friend-promotion post because the book is not published yet, you literally can&#39;t read it. But literary agents want you to be able to compare your book to similar, recently published books, and my friend is having trouble thinking of one that fits. I am too! I&#39;ve read a lot of books and their manuscript doesn&#39;t seem particularly esoteric or weird, but I can&#39;t seem to figure out a good comp title for them, even though I have like four for my manuscript. </p> <p>So, with that explanation out of the way, can you recommend any recently-published (ideally within the last five years) sci-fi novels with Western (i.e., cowboy story) influences? It would need to not be too dark, but also not an outright comedy. It feels like a lot of the speculative fiction I&#39;ve been seeing come out lately is either very dark and grim or outright comedy. </p> <p

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I typically read Fantasy, Sci-Fi, and Romance. “Romantasy” is hit and miss for me. </p> <p>I enjoyed Fourth Wing, hated Iron Flame. ACOTAR was fine, I loved Crescent City and Throne of Glass. A lot of the popular Instagram Romance/Fantasy books have been misses for me, so let’s steer clear of those for now, I think. I finished the Mistborn Trilogy recently and since then I just haven’t been into anything. </p> <p>I think I’m looking for something “cozy” for the holidays. I have Kindle Unlimited, so if it’s available there, that’s a bonus. like romance novels, usually small town. I really have enjoyed Emily Henry, Liz Tomforde, Elsie Silver and Abby Jimenez this year. I loved all of Kristin Hannah’s books.</p> <p>For reference, some of my absolute favorite books have been: Throne of Glass (specifically TOD, which I know is a controversial take) Ender’s Game DaVici Code Dune (I loved that series) Percy Jackson has been a long time favorite even into ad
