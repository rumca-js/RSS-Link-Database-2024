Spent the last couple of days creating a Docker image for it, which wasn’t easy, but it’s so satisfying to see it working seamlessly now. Between navigating Docker commands and figuring out how to structure everything properly, it was definitely a learning experience. But now that the image is built and running, it’s time to dive into testing and exploring all the amazing features this thing has to offer.</p> <p>So what’s Mr. CrackBot AI? It’s a fully automated penetration testing tool desig
