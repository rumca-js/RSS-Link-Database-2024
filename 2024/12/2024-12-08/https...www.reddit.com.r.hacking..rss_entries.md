<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all,</p> <p>I was at a restaurant yesterday, it was great food and all but my gf and I saw that even though our phones were showing that everything was ok (4g and all) we couldn’t access internet </p> <p>The restaurant had their WiFi signs everywhere inside, I also saw 2 cameras (might be unrelated), and even though it isn’t that unusual, we were offered to pay less if we paid in cash (might also be unrelated but you get the full picture)</p> <p>I know it isn’t secured to connect to an unknown WiFi network but I was wondering if this could be some kind of WiFi scam or idk ? Also it was in a very touristic area </p> <p>Do you have any info about how this kind of scam could work ? Like is it something widespread ? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/soupe-mis0"> /u/soupe-mis0 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1h9s966/shady_restaurant_maybe_wifi_scam/">[link]</a></s

## 2 BIN files in an encrypted ZIP file. Anyway to bruteforce or get the hash or anything? I paid for this, it’s meant to be access and a portal to my old old account which has rlly important data.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Encrypted zip file with 2 BIN files, how do I get the password or hash?</p> <p>But the person on the other end is refusing to give me the passwords without payment. It’s just important backups from an account I lost years ago. File size is only 7.41 mb so immediately in suspect that they are just empty bin files or files that have nothing I asked for.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/p5ycliqu3"> /u/p5ycliqu3 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1h9j4zg/2_bin_files_in_an_encrypted_zip_file_anyway_to/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1h9j4zg/2_bin_files_in_an_encrypted_zip_file_anyway_to/">[comments]</a></span>
