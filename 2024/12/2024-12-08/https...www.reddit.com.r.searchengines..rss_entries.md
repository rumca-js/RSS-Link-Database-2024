<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>It&#39;s true that due to Google&#39;s vastness in the internet helps it to remain the most powerful search engine with relevant local results. It&#39;s AI answers are also quite good. And undoubtedly it&#39;s image results are best among all. On the other hand, Bing also provides good results on specific topics. It&#39;s quite helpful while researching on specific topics (also academic). But it&#39;s image results are not as good as Google imo. Still it&#39;s good in its own way. What&#39;s your opinion and choice?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/humid_mist"> /u/humid_mist </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/searchengines/comments/1h9nztp/if_i_ask_you_to_choose_between_google_and_bing/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/searchengines/comments/1h9nztp/if_i_ask_you_to_choose_between_google_and_bing/">[comments]</a></span>
