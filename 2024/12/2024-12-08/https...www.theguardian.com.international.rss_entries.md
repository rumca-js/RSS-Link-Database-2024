<p>In Syria’s capital, residents are in a daze as they try to absorb Assad’s dramatic downfall</p><p>The road to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/08/syrian-rebels-enter-damascus-everything-we-know">Damascus</a> was lined with discarded army uniforms. In a panic, Syrian army soldiers stripped down in the streets in the early hours of Sunday morning, realising their leader, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/08/syria-doctor-to-brutal-dictator-rise-fall-bashar-al-assad">Bashar al-Assad, had abandoned them</a> after 54 years of his family’s rule over Syria.</p><p>Syrian army tanks, which were supposed to stop the lightning rebel offensive which started just 11 days earlier, stood empty in front of checkpoints with posters of the late leader Hafez al-Assad, his face half torn. Out of habit, a driver stopped and rolled down the window, but there was no one at the checkpoint.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/08/our-father-did-not-di

<p>While so many Americans struggle to get by, the US is spending record-breaking amounts of money on the military</p><p>Today in America, 60% of our people live paycheck to paycheck, 85 million people are uninsured or underinsured and 21.5 million households are paying more than 50% of their income on housing. We have one of the highest rates of childhood poverty of almost any developed country on Earth, and 25% of older adults are trying to survive on $15,000 a year or less. In other words, the United States has fallen far behind other major countries in protecting the most vulnerable, and our government has failed millions of working families.</p><p>But while so many Americans are struggling to get by, the United States is spending record-breaking amounts of money on the military.
