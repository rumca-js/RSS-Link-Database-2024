<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I couldn&#39;t think of another sub to ask this. If this isn&#39;t the right one, please tell me which one to direct the question in the comments</p> <p>So, for some fucking reason I put a password to enter bios mode more or less 1 year ago and I have no clue what the password is anymore. I tried removing the CMOS battery for 25 minutes already and it still asks me for password. Do Acer laptops store the bios settings in a different place or something? That wouldn&#39;t make much sense because then what would be the use of the CMOS battery anyway? Regardless; is there any other way to achieve the same thing?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Prynpo"> /u/Prynpo </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1h43vlp/deleting_bios_data/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1h43vlp/deleting_bios_data/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I ended up finding a vulnerability on a well known company’s website in accordance with their bug bounty program scope and ended up reporting it. HackerOne’s triage team told me that another researcher already submitted a report on that vulnerability and closed my report out as a duplicate.</p> <p>I did see that they linked the other person’s report along with its status and submission date, albeit I couldn’t actually access the contents of the report. That person reported it coming up on about 2 years ago and it has been sitting under “Triaged” status the entire time. It’s a low severity vulnerability that probably wouldn’t be difficult at all to fix. </p> <p>Though based on the report date and how long it’s been sitting there, I’m starting to think that maybe they just don’t care. So with that said, would I be able to publicly disclose the vulnerability given that they closed my report and have been sitting on the other one for 2 years now?</p> </d

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hacking isn’t about memorizing tricks or collecting tools like a keyring full of exploits to try on every random lock you find. That’s a beginner’s misconception—a surface-level view that misses the essence of what hacking actually is. Think of it more like <strong>puzzle-solving</strong>, where you start with a fundamental understanding of how systems work, and then apply creativity, logic, and critical thinking to figure out how to make those systems behave in ways they weren’t designed to.</p> <p>Injection, XSS, buffer overflows, and all the other techniques aren’t the &quot;keys&quot; themselves. They’re more like <em>conceptual crowbars</em> or <em>leverage points</em>—ways to interact with the system’s inner logic. But here’s the kicker: <strong>the real magic isn’t in the tools; it’s in your mindset.</strong> You need to train your brain to look at things differently. When you see an application, you shouldn’t just see its intended function; y
