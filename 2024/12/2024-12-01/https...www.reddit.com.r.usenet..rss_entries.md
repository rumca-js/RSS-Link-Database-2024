<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi! I just started using Usenet this year. I only use Newshosting and free indexers. I have a problem that I can&#39;t download some files. There are not many of them, literally less than 10, but I don’t know how to deal with this. They give an error (incomplete). What should I do? </p> <p>Buy a block account?</p> <p>Buy a paid indexer? </p> <p>Or will I never do anything about it? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Inogdateplo"> /u/Inogdateplo </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1h4coed/block_account_or_paid_indexer/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1h4coed/block_account_or_paid_indexer/">[comments]</a></span>

## What Torrent indexer do you all use? Is Torrent indexer needed for Sonarr?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>First of all, thank you so much for helping me set up my Usenet system. I feel incredibly lucky to have your support. I&#39;m all set with Usenet now and, to top it off, I scored a FREE VPN from the Black Friday deal—which is a real blessing! </p> <p>So, yesterday, I managed to get the qBittorrent client working with my VPN. However, when I tried using Sonarr, it wouldn&#39;t download anything. I suspect the issue is that I don&#39;t have a torrent indexer configured.</p> <p>so my question is:</p> <p>1- Is there a torrent indexer I should use?</p> <p>2- Any Black Friday deal still available for Torrent? </p> <p>3- Any Free indexer that works with Sonarr? </p> <p>Please advise </p> <p>Thanks </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/TheLastAirbender2025"> /u/TheLastAirbender2025 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1h4awl7/what_torrent_indexer_do_you_all_use_is_torrent/">[link

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have been searching and have also asked their support but I didn&#39;t get a response (I assume timezone).</p> <p>When accessing usenet-crawler website with a new IP, you need to authorise the address via an automated email. With API calls is this also the case? My home IP changes whenever the router is restarted or if their is NBN maintenance.</p> <p>My concern is that my API access would drop off without knowing whenever my server address changes.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Jimbuscus"> /u/Jimbuscus </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1h3wg13/question_about_usenetcrawler/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1h3wg13/question_about_usenetcrawler/">[comments]</a></span>

Christ there might be more…I can’t look at it anymore - forget about setting priorities. </p> <p>For anyone that knows this stuff like the back o their hand…how good/bad is my coverage?
