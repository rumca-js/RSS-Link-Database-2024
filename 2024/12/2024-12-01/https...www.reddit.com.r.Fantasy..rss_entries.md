<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I first read Jordan&#39;s <em>The Eye of the World</em> about 15 years ago, and for various reasons never finished the series. But I remembered liking this, so I&#39;m giving it another go.</p> <p>I love how slow this book is. I haven&#39;t gotten very far (Rand has just learned from Moraine that he&#39;ll have to leave), and I love that. I love that we get to take so much time in this area, and meet the characters, and see the preparations for the festival, and hear all about mothers trying to set Tam (and Rand) up with a new wife, because he shouldn&#39;t just be a bachelor.</p> <p>So much modern fantasy feels so <em>rushed</em> to me. I know some of that is publishing demands (many modern publishers won&#39;t publish a debut over 120k words), but I also feel like a lot of modern entertainment is built on breakneck cliffhangers. It almost seems that if this book had been published in the modern milieu, the first chapter would have been Rand and Tam

Not only was most of the first half of the novel simply set up for events in later books, but the story&#39;s pacing remained pretty slow. Having two hundred pages of setup before the main character does something important is just too much for me, and it was made worse by the slog of Simon floundering through the woods with Binabik until they finally reach their destination. It&#39;s probably unfair to compare Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn to The Wheel of Time, but The Eye of the World executes a similar plotline much better.</p> <p>I complained about the pacing when I was about halfway through the book, and commenters promised that i

His foil is the very well-named (a little on the nose to be honest) Sebastian Grimm.

Leo would much rather play his violin, drink, and cavort, but needs must.</p> <p>Sorcerers in this world come in two types: scriveners and casters.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>As an older reader, I am always frustrated at ranking lists that the only have the Lord of the Rings and Wheel of Time on them as proof that Fantasy existed before the year 2000. There are so many good older series that don&#39;t seem to be considered. I realize that a lot of it has to do with Booktube and Booktok creators being younger, but there as so many good older series that I read when I was there age, that seem to be forgotten. Just to help educate readers a bit younger than me, what are some of your favorite older SF/fantasy books/series that you think need some exposure? I&#39;ll start with ten of mine in no particular order.</p> <ul> <li>Chronicles of Amber - Roger Zelazny</li> <li>Dragonriders of Pern - Anne McCaffrey</li> <li>World of Tiers - Philip Jose Farmer</li> <li>Deryni Chronicles - Katherine Kurtz</li> <li>Magician Series - Raymond Feist</li> <li>Four Lords of the Diamond - Jack L Chalker</li> <li>Myth Adventures - Robert Asprin<

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I was very into the Tortall books as a kid and appreciated having stories focused on complex girl/women characters, and the openness about things like periods and first crushes and the other things that were relevant in my life. I want my nieces to have similar books to relate to, but am wary of the age gap relationships and questionable race representations/dynamics. Are there any more modern books that capture the same magic?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/muddlet"> /u/muddlet </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1h3uo7z/contemporary_authors_similar_to_tamora_pierce/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1h3uo7z/contemporary_authors_similar_to_tamora_pierce/">[comments]</a></span>

What‚Äôs a good book to begin with?</p> <p>It could be standalone but I‚Äôm a big fan of longer series if he has one.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>And it did not disappoint!! I&#39;ve been seeing this trilogy pop up all over reddit and I finally read it for myself. Some of the most interesting and well-developed characters I&#39;ve ever read. Each of the POVs had such distinctive voices, it was never unclear who was the focus. Does anyone have some suggestions for books/series where the different perspectives are similarly established?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Brit_in_Disguise"> /u/Brit_in_Disguise </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1h3qgm3/finally_read_the_first_law/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1h3qgm3/finally_read_the_first_law/">[comments]</a></span>
