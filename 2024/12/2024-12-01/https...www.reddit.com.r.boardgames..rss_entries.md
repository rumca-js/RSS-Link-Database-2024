I&#39;m not sure if this is the right subreddit for this type of a question, but maybe someone here can help me (or get inspired to do the same thing for a secret santa gift!). I ordered the small version of the Guess Who game and am planning on printing my own pictures instead of the default pictures. I was wondering if anyone here owns this game (the small version) and knows what size the pictures are, so I could print the pictures and have them ready before when the game arrives, since it will probably arrive at the last moments before the party.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/kokoomusnuori69"> /u/kokoomusnuori69 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1h46yxy/guess_who_grab_and_go_for_secret_santa/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1h46yxy/guess_who_grab_and_go_for_secret_santa/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have been searching for this game from my childhood on and off for years. I played it in the late 80’s, early 90’s. The playing surface was a giant (about 4’ x 3’) map of the world that was put together with large foam puzzle pieces. Each player would get an itinerary they would have to follow to different places around the world. Every time you reached a destination, you put a push pin in it and connected it to the last place you were at with a string. I think the way you won, was if you completed your itinerary first. I think there were different ways you could get to each destination as well, i.e. plane train, etc. If it’s a regional thing, I’m from Canada. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Halloweencandycane"> /u/Halloweencandycane </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1h46k14/looking_for_an_old_game_i_used_to_play/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="htt

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello beautiful board gamers! My brother and his wife are HUGE board game people. Every time I visit I get to learn new games and I love board games as a way to spend time. For Christmas I’d like to make them a bunch of bags for games, but was hoping to do so without asking what sizes I should make and letting one or the other of them in on my gift idea. For reference, they have well over 150 board games of all types and sizes and prices. An entire wall of board games. Are there certain sizes of bags that I could sew many of that would be most useful without knowing all of the games they have? Sorry if the question is weird! If the answer is that I should really ask them, I can definitely just do that. I just like the idea of surprising them. 🩶 Thank you all in advance!!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/bguthrie13"> /u/bguthrie13 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/commen

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>TL;DR: Is the game overrated especially as a solo campaign game? Are the ratings just a product of the box size and production quality? Or should I not listen to the “haters”?</p> <p>I’m really interested in solo-able campaign games with a story focus, especially when it’s set in a science-fiction thematic. And even though the game still has amazing ratings, I keep hearing that it’s not that great.</p> <p>I was curious what opinions people have, what issues you see with the game, etc.</p> <p>From what I understand, the focus on dice as the core mechanic means it’s a lot of RNG you have to deal with. To be honest I still have to figure out if I’m strongly opposed to dice and RNG im board games. </p> <p>Another criticism I’ve heard multiple times was the story. It’s not interesting enough especially to those who are familiar with e.g. Mass Effect and might be too long? So the motivation to finish the story by going to the repetitive dice chugging is so

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am making a game about goblins in a ghetto in like a 1950s mafia. Players try to become the next mafia boss by either, challenging him and defeating him or by becoming his successor by being scary, rich or strong(different bosses have different requirements). Players take missions for gold, items, weapons and armour and then buy from the market. They then resolve their missions by fighting enemies like the police. My current fighting mechanic is just you use you weapon and hit them then they hit you, then you hit them, then they hit you. I have a value(speed) which determines who starts each combat and damage and defence. I also have ranged weapons and melee weapons(ranged weapons get hits in before they can hit you). This is a very boring combat system and doesn&#39;t feel like you can do anything.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I hosted a game night and agreed to play <em>Catan</em> for a friend (Player A), even though I hate it. After 2 hours and 45 minutes, the game got toxic with two players ganging up on someone, so I ended it early by making the points to win lower and then we switched to a social deduction game.</p> <p>Everyone seemed to enjoy the new game, except Player A. Instead of saying he wasn’t into it and asking for another game, after a while he started sabotaging every round by revealing his role, ruining the fun. Everyone including me got so frustrated at this that I ended the game, switched to a new game just to try to end the night early with a good game and the sent everyone home.</p> <p>Player A apologized later via text, but I haven’t responded. I’m still upset because I gave his game a fair shot and handled it respectfully, while he derailed the night for everyone else. Should I talk to him about it or just stop inviting him?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I’ve been asking for help identifying a game I love for the past couple days here on the subreddit and the lovely community helped me find the game, which is entitled Do You Know It? I tried to upload an image but I’m pretty new to Reddit and this sub seems to have specific rules regarding images that I don’t quite understand haha. It’s a green box with a red and blue rectangle on the front if you guys wanted to see an image. Published by Patch.</p> <p>Now here’s my issue:</p> <p>It appears the game is out of print. I went to the publishers website and they don’t even make mention of ever having made this game. I found this image online but it’s comically hard to find info about this game. Not even BGG seems to know about it. My questions are:</p> <p>Are there any resources for trying to find a new copy of this game? My Mom is weird about secondhand stuff</p> <p>How can I check about the copyright of this game? It was a super fun game and I think
