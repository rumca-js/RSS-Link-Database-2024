Tech in Computer Science and I am worried about the future of us students because if you see, whatever projects we are doing, Al is actually helping us fully.. like we continuously keep asking to implement small small parts of the project in ChatGPT or Claude till the end and it does well. So, I just want to know like if ChatGPT can do it, why does the company need us in large numbers? Even though now it requires some help from us after 2-3 years Al would be advanced right??</p> <p>And I also have seen a lot of people say focus on coding.. if you could specifically say what to focus on coding? Is it like dsa or development or any specific stack? (I am quite good as DSA) What&#39;s your advice and how and what as a 3rd year student we should focus to get a job in this scenario and sustain and grow in this industry?</p> <p>Thanks in advance.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https:/",
