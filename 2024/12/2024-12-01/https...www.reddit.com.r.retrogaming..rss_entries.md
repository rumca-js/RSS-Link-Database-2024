<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am getting a weird issue with a Model 1 Genesis board version VA6 that I am repairing. Originally, the console did not power on at all, so I did a recap. After the recap, the system now has power, and the LED is turning on, but there is no video. By chance, I hit the reset button, and the video momentarily showed up. (I have been able to replicate this several times. After turning the power switch off and then back on, I can short to ground and the video will show up for about 3 to 4 seconds) I have gone through the board to check for capacitors that I may have installed backward or any solder shorts but found nothing out of place. I also ran through the board with a multi-meter, but could not find anything. I am still learning the circuitry so it is very possible I missed something. I am not sure what all was wrong with this console before I got it. Any help would be appreciated.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://w

Im not sure if there are any other services i would need, i saw the Fenrir now supports backing up saves to the microSD. </p> <p>For the services ive seen lots of companies, stone age was most familiar but their prices seemed high.

German Version (I am german, so dont hate me with &quot;Oh, its bad Pal 50 Hz bullshit&quot; because I dont care about it being 50 Hz...) of Legend of Dragoon for around 1/3 less than EBAY sells the game usually. As an JRPG fan I, of course, bit the bullet (especially since only a few JRPGs released here at that time). Discs also looked very clean, too. Although... no manual.</p> <p>When I got home I noticed that the discs have a <strong>&quot;Promo Only&quot;</strong> text on the bottom.

I don&#39;t recall any texture or geography to the maps. </p> <p>The combat grid was squares, with different terrain in each one. Units had strengths and weaknesses depending on what terrain they were in. It was turn based. You would place/move your units, then the battle would play out for the turn. </p> <p>The gameplay was simple, you just move your units around and can attack adjacent square/cities. The civil war game had infantry, cavalry, cannons. WW2 had infantry, tanks, airplanes, boats, and maybe artillery.</p> <p>There was a single-player vs AI mode and a multiplayer mode.

Plus, I&#39;ve found &quot;polished 72 pin&quot; consoles more expensive than ones with a new 72 pin in Ebay, so not sure if the extra price bump is worth it.</p> <p>3) Buy new NES clone console that can play NES games and some NES games: Reasoning
