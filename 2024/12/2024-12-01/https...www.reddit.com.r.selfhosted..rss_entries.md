I&#39;m running Proxmox on an old PC with 1 NVME drive (Proxmox) and 3 10TB HDDs (Media Server). The server itself is hosted on an Ubuntu VM. When I first set it up a few months back, I initially set up Mergerfs and SnapRaid on Proxmox itself and while Mergerfs worked fine, SnapRaid refused to sync. I went on anyway and setup the VM that now has a fair amount of media files saved on it and I am sharing it with other people. Recently I&#39;ve decided to host some more applications and maybe play around with some more VMs so I want the server to be running 24/7 which was not my original plan, but due to this I&#39;m now more worried about having some sort of parity/redundancy. I&#39;ll outline my future plans, wants, and needs to hopefully give a better idea of the picture I have in my head for what

A couple of says ago i set up a home server for hosting different servers (teamspeak, minecraft, etc). Yesterday was a short power outage and since then I cannot connect using external IPs, only LAN. I can&#39;t even use remote desktop into the server with puplic IP but only local address (which was possible before).<br/> Weird thing is, before i set up the server I was hosting them from my PC and can&#39;t even do that anymore, like the firewall is blocking all the traffic. Tried disabling the firewall of my pc (both private and public) but that didn&#39;t work either.</p> <p>I check the firewall rules, IP changes, even reset the router and tried another one. On the ISP side they told me everything was normal and no ports were blocked (asked them to specifically check if port 9987 UDP and 30033 TCP were blocked). </p> <p>Any ideas?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi <a href="/r/selfhosted">r/selfhosted</a>!</p> <p>I&#39;m in the process of setting up a self-hosted media server for my family, where each person will have their own profile and watch history. My goal is to allow multiple people to watch content simultaneously while having each person’s individual watch history tracked.</p> <p>I want to use Stremio as the media viewer, but I’m open to other apps if they provide better shared viewing functionality. What I&#39;m aiming for is the ability for two or more people to watch the same content at the same time, while both profiles are updated with their respective watch histories.</p> <p>For example, let’s say my wife and I are watching a series together—can I update both of our watch histories automatically? Is there any existing way to sync watch histories for shared viewing, or would I need to implement a custom solution?</p> <p>Has anyone done something similar before with Stremio or any other media ser

After a bit of digging I found that my VM was stuck because the ZFS pool was unresponsive and full of errors. I was really surprised because the pool has 10 disks in different controllers and 9/10 were failing. </p> <p>It took me a while to figure it out but I found out that 2/12 of my DIMMS were not responding (it was the connector not the RAM sticks) and I had one faulty RAM. </p> <p>The last two weeks we&#39;ve been having a lot of power outages and surges where I live and I guess it damaged my server. As a preventive measures I just installed a surge arrester but I guess it was already too late.
