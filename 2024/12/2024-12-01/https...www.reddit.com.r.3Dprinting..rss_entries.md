If you really want to purchase something and it cannot be fixed with simple parts that they may or may not send out it you will not get a refund/replacement.</p> <p>Firstly I am physically disabled and have multiple physical illnesses, due to my disabilities I have a limited income. I really wanted to get in to 3D printing for some rehabilitation and to learn a new skill, I was really excited at this prospect and did a lot of research on 3D printers.</p> <p>After lots of reading I settled on a QIDI Q1 Pro, I came across the QIDI UK store which is <a href="http://uk.qidi.com/">uk.qidi3d.com<
