<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am seeking books that don&#39;t have Christmas-specific plots, but either take place at Christmas or have big Yule energy. Die Hard (if it were a book) would pass muster, as it happens at Christmas but the plot isn&#39;t Christmas-specific. So does Doomsday Book. The Dark Is Rising and Hogfather feel seasonal, but aren&#39;t specifically Christmas-y. Protagonist who goes to her family Christmas tree farm to learn the true meaning of Christmas from a ghost who only comes out for Christmas does NOT pass muster, as it&#39;s Christmas specific. (A fine line, I realize.)</p> <p>SFF preferred but I&#39;ll hear you out on any genre. I&#39;m not a big romance person, with the exception of T. Kingfisher&#39;s stuff, but you&#39;re welcome to recommend romance. What I&#39;m really looking for is stuff that feels old, pagan, or just deeply winter-y.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/itscapybaratime"> /u/its

I&#39;m looking for books that go over actual or speculative advances in nuclear and other advanced weaponry post the development of the hydrogen bomb and MIRVs. Obviously a lot of it is top secret but clearly some things, like advances in directed energy weapons, are &quot;known&quot; to the public.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I&#39;m 17 years old and a big reader since I was little. My preferred books are a bit more mature than the current booktok teenager/young adult books that are popular now. I have read lots of those romances that are big on TikTok (Icebreaker, Twisted series etc.) but I don&#39;t enjoy them anymore. A few of the books I&#39;ve read recently and liked are Purple Hibiscus by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, Breaking Point by Edel Coffey, and all of Sally Rooney&#39;s books (I read her new one too it&#39;s really good). But my real problem is that while these are amazing books they are all just so sad and I just can&#39;t cope with sad books at the moment. I did like how in Intermezzo and Breaking Point there was a bit of romance (the tiniest bit in Breaking Point) but it wasn&#39;t the whole focus of the book. Does anyone have suggestions for books anything like what I described? I don&#39;t mind a little bit of sadness in the books as long as it won&#39;t

So I&#39;m looking for generally great books that she could enjoy, she enjoys biographies, I&#39;ve seen her read some sci-fi, romance and a lot more of everything else. The books should be mainstream-ish so I can find translated versions since she doesn&#39;t read in English. Below are the names of the books I&#39;ve seen her read: &quot;The couple next door&quot; by Shari Lapena, &quot;The fire witness&quot; by Lars Kepler, Anna Todds &quot;After&quot; series, as well as many biographies of artists or famous female figures. Any reccommendations are appreciated!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/xdToastMan"> /u/xdToastMan </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1h428ad/looking_for_books

I did find a great book on &#39;Radioactive Substances&#39; on Amazon (a little outdated now), by a Polish-French lady who really had a knack for straightforwardness and an incredible passion for the field... and I also found a more recent book on introductory calculus by a female mathematician that&#39;s a joy to read. </p> <p>But, really, any book recommendations by female authors in science would be great. </p> <p>Thanks! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitte

Romance, adventure, somewhat morally grey. The books had amazing lesson, life struggles and triumphs written thought out it in a subtle but powerful way. So many well though out plot twist. As well as connections in the last book to the first and all throughout. It was an amazing written series and I do not know what to read now! Any recommendations? Preferably a series I read quickly .
