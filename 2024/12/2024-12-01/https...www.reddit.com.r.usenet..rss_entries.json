I&#39;m all set with Usenet now and, to top it off, I scored a FREE VPN from the Black Friday deal\u2014which is a real blessing! </p> <p>So, yesterday, I managed to get the qBittorrent client working with my VPN. However, when I tried using Sonarr, it wouldn&#39;t download anything. I suspect the issue is that I don&#39;t have a torrent indexer configured.</p> <p>so my question is:</p> <p>1- Is there a torrent indexer I should use?</p> <p>2- Any Black Friday deal still available for Torrent? </p> <p>3- Any Free indexer that works with Sonarr? </p> <p>Please advise </p> <p>Thanks </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/TheLastAirbender2025\"> /u/TheLastAirbender2025 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1h4awl7/what_torrent_indexer_do_you_all_use_is_torrent/\">[link",
