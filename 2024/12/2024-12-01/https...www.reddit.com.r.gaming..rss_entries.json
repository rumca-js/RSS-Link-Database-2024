You can customize the controls to whatever you like. If you want to hold down a button, tap it, or just press it to do a certain action for instance. In other games changing the controls can be more difficult than it needs to be but Ubisoft just gives you the power to do what works best for you.</p> <p>I noticed Ubisoft really puts a lot of controls in the players hands when it comes to the gameplay as well.</p> <p>In star wars outlaws you can change little things like turning on or off the mini puzzles when working on terminals or unlocking doors. You can change the text on the cards in the card games so it&#39;s easier to read among other things. I love this especially as you can turn off whatever you want so it doesn&#39;t hurt the flow of the game.</p> <p>These are just a few options of course. Ubisoft gets a lot of hat",

IMO, of course</p> <p>Even Halo 2, which had amazing vehicle combat, lost something with destructible vehicles. There\u2019s something pure about the indestructible warthog that goes soaring through the sky when it gets struck by a perfectly timed rocket/grenade.

Go through killing everyone in level, then run it back cleaning it up. Every time I make a huge pool of blood or splatter a guy on a wall my satisfying cleaner part of me wants to well just clean it up, so a game like that would be really a dream come true. To my knowledge I don&#39;t think there is a game like that, just one or the other, but surely there&#39;s something out there atleast a bit like that. I humbly ask reddit to help me in my search of more niche games to play.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/FlashyBackies\"> /u/FlashyBackies </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h3zn7s/viscera_cleanup_arena_shooter_is_this_a_thing/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h3zn7s/viscera_cleanup_arena_shooter_is_th",

She can, however, play games where the camera is more fixed or further away in 3rd person (like WoW) on a smaller screen. I&#39;m getting a new laptop so she is going to use my old one and try to find some new games she can play without getting sick.</p> <p>What are some games that are good for people who get motion sickness? She likes RPGs, magic and fantasy, adventure games. Not much for shooters, racing, or sports games. She plays a bit of WoW, but I&#39;d like to find some things that aren&#39;t subscription based since she refuses to pay for that. I have Game Pass, so that would be ideal, but going through Steam or GoG is fine too. Nothing super graphic intensive since she&#39;ll be playing on a 4 year old Alienware laptop with a RTX 2060.
