<ul><li>Linebacker ejected after hit leaves QB concussed</li><li>Vikings and Colts seal late victories</li></ul><p>Joe Mixon ran for 101 yards and a touchdown, Nico Collins caught eight passes for 119 yards and the Houston Texans beat Jacksonville after Trevor Lawrence was forced out of the game with a concussion after a controversial hit. The AFC South-leading Texans (8-5) won for just the second time in five weeks and staggered into their bye week with a little momentum.<br><br>
 Mixon carried 20 times, none bigger than his eight-yard gain on third-and-five in the waning minutes that moved the chains and sealed the victory. CJ Stroud completed 22 of 34 passes for 242 yards, with a 22-yard TD pass to Dalton Schultz early in the fourth quarter that essentially iced the game. It was Houston’s 12th win in their past 14 meetings with the Jaguars (2-10) and sixth in a row in Jacksonville.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/dec/01/nfl-roundup-sunday-football-scores">Conti

<p>It’s all about appreciating those special little moments, but there are way to many distractions to really make it count</p><p>A splinter of desperation has attached itself to my sorry attempts to romanticise my life. I guess the project started in lockdown as I, along with everyone else, scrabbled around for ways to get through the days with our humanity intact. I lit little candles, you know. Kept the fairy lights on. Working from home, I wore a heel under the desk, though that was short-lived as I tripped on my dressing gown. I upgraded said gown, incidentally – on eBay I bought 1 x silky kimono thing, and for the darker months, in which we now find ourselves, something belted and lilac in silk velvet. The plan was that I could always throw it on top of my grumping thermals to add that shard of glamour when the Asda delivery man arrived, but I fear it falls slightly short of the 1930s Hollywood vision I was aiming for, and I look more like “a person going through something”.</p

<p>The ex-German chancellor’s memoir details the myriad issues she faced, from the 2008 financial crash to Covid-19, but studiously avoids much in the way of insights and analysis </p><p>Ever since the end of the second world war, when Germans somewhat belatedly realised what the rhetoric of the Nazi years had done to their country, it has been a basic requirement of politicians in Germany that they should be boring. The very few postwar political figures whose speeches were exciting to listen to, such as Herbert Wehner or Franz Josef Strauss, met with widespread suspicion, not least because they were unwilling to follow this fundamental precept. Angela Merkel, federal chancellor and head of the German government from 2005 to 2021, was canny enough to adhere to it in full measure.</p><p>The dullness of her political utterances is faithfully reproduced in this volume of memoirs. By and large, Merkel’s recollection, assisted by her co-author (her long-term close ally and personal assis

<p>Lars Tunbjörk’s late-90s picture of a Manhattan legal firm recalls a time before modular sofas and mobile phones</p><p>The Swedish photographer Lars Tunbjörk spent five years in the late 1990s touring city offices in New York, Tokyo and Stockholm and documenting what he found there. This picture was taken in a Manhattan legal office in 1997; it would be safe to say it was not paper-free. Though Tunbjörk might not quite have known it at the time, he captured in those pictures enclosed, climate-controlled worlds in mortal jeopardy. New York’s 2002 Smoke Free Air Act, for example, confined to history small men wandering the office with cigars between their teeth; women in pearls surrounded by legal proofs under office tables also became a rarer sight in the new millennium.</p><p>Tunbjörk, who died in 2015, did not stage his pictures. He became a modern master of the padded cubicle and the strip light and the ergonomic swivel chair. When his book of office pictures was first published
