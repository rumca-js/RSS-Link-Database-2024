<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Ignore the Minecraft tag/ I REALLY need help on this, I was tryna install some mods from chrome on my phone for less lag, but when I tried to download them then it showed &quot;app not installed as it&#39;s not compatible with your device&quot; I tried it on 3 different phones, they all showed app not installed or app not installed because isn&#39;t compatible, I can download the normal version off the app store on all of them, ive also already hard reset the phones doesn&#39;t work either, I live in Europe is there some regional restrictions on downloading apps ftom chrome? I&#39;ve asked chatgpt and looked up every possible solution, none of them worked - sorry if this is a rant, im really tired, my new phone can&#39;t download anything because of the error, if you can, please help</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Aggressive_Loan78"> /u/Aggressive_Loan78 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.red
