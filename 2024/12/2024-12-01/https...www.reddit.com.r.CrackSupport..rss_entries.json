I had got it from fitgirl and tried reinstalling from both fitgirl and dodi but it simply won&#39;t launch. My vram is very low like 128mb but still it&#39;s weird considering how long I had played this game. I tried deleting everything (except the prefetch) about the game in order to install fresh but still won&#39;t work.
