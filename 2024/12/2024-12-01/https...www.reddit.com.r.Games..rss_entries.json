I&#39;m a solo developer, and I&#39;m excited to share <em>From The Bunker</em>, a game I&#39;ve been working on for two years. In this game, you play as a group of survivors who have found a fortified bunker and are trying to endure in a world overrun by the living dead. You&#39;ll explore the map in search of resources, fend off zombies, bandits, and other threats, and build relationships with factions. You&#39;ll constantly face tough decisions: to help or to harm, to kill or be killed, to save yourself or your comrade. Your choices alone will determine whether you live to see another day or if the world loses yet another group of survivors. Do whatever it takes to survive!</p> <h1>Key Features:</h1> <ul> <li><strong>Survive the undead:</strong> Face relentless zombie hordes, bandits, and unforeseen dangers.</li> <li><strong>Dynamic events:</strong> Make hard choices that test your morals\u2014save yourself, or risk everything for others?<",

We thought it would be cool to combine ARPG-systems (as found in Diablo-likes) with MMORPG-style Combat and Raid Encounter Design. We have been working on this project for 3 years now and just released our <strong>Free Demo on Steam.</strong></p> <p>The game brings together core elements from traditional isometric ARPGs (lots of loot, lots of enemies, endlessly repeatable endgame content, deep character progression) and encounter/combat design from popular MMORPGs (third-person, epic boss fights, stylized art style). You can do all of this in sin",
