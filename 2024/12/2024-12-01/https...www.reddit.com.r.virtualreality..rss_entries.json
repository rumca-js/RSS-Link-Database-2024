Going back to the Index once in a while really shows me how much it breaks my immersion. Now I was wondering if it would be worth it to upgrade to a Quest 3 (for improved clarity and FOV) or if there are any even higher end VR headsets that offer wireless PCVR. Size, weight nor price are a consideration. Bulky or heavy headsets never bothered me, and I don&#39;t mind spending a little (up to ~2k). All it needs is better clarity than the Q2 and be wireless. Larger FOV would be a nice perk too but not a necessity.
