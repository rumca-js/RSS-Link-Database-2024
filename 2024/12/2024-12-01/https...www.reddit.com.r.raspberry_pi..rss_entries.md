<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>A few days ago I got my first ever Raspberry Pi Pico W and tried it. Already tried a few things with the built in LED and thought I should move to LCD. Its a 16x2, no i2c but for some reason it doesnt show the things I try.<br/> The LCD itself is working and shows some letters but not the right ones and im not sure why.<br/> lcd.clear() works, but lcd.putstr(&quot;hello&quot;) shows &quot;dd&quot;, sometimes g, basically random letters.<br/> I cant find online what could be the problem, any idea?<br/> Ps.: Sorry for bad english its not my first language </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Trud1a"> /u/Trud1a </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1h40g8i/raspberry_pi_pico_w_lcd_not_working_random/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1h40g8i/raspberry_pi_pico_w_lcd_not_working_random/">[comments]</a></span>

When I examined the permissions this is what I saw. Left side is the terminal from the Pi. Right side is terminal when SSH into the NAS. The Pi indicates that the user and group is root however the NAS says differently for the same directory. Not sure what is going on here. </p> <p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/ixqfei0jq54e1.png?width=99
