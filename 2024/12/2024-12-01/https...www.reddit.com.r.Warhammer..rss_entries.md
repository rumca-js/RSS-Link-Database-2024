<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Wanted the hive minds opinion, I&#39;ve been painting and collecting warhammer for about 5 years now but never really played.</p> <p>Last week my friend convinced me to play so I got a codex and cobbled together 2k of the models I had, no real thought as to what units etc just the ones I like. I show up to the game and my friend had what I now know is a tournament winning list, to make matters worse he got a lot of his own armies rules wrong although I don&#39;t think this was on purpose. </p> <p>Needless to say I got absolutely hammered with all the special rules and &quot;gotcha&quot; moments they handed out and now im not sure if I just dont enjoy warhammer or if it was just playing against my friend. He asked to play today but I said I was busy. </p> <p>Am u over reacting?
