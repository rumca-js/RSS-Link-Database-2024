Pipe insulation tips…air leaks through pipes are problematic in old homes. I use Great Stuff Gaps and Cracks Pro to fill those voids. I love using the spray foam gun because I can adjust the size of the foam. When possible I seal both sides of the pipe to reduce air leaks and hopefully utility bills. Many thanks to Great Stuff for sponsoring this video, visit greatstuff.dupont.com to find the best spray foam for your project 🙌🏽🔥#insulation #sprayfoam #greatstuff #brandpartner
