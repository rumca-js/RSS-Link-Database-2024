<p>By revealing the murky circumstances in which it was created, Charles King’s fascinating history of the oratorio shows it in a new light</p><p>I love the amorous mayhem of Handel’s operas, but have always had my doubts about his oratorios, especially the <em>Messiah</em>. First there’s the bossy compulsion to stand during the “Hallelujah” chorus, just because a spurious tradition says that King George II did so in 1743; once hoisted upright, you have to fidget through endless awkwardly mis-accentuated iterations of “for ever and ever”. I’m also puzzled by the quirks of the biblical text, which are underlined by musical repetition. The soprano rhapsodises like a fetishist about the “beautiful feet” of those who preach the gospel, and the tenor prophesies that “every valley shall be exalted” by the saviour: will salvation really reflate those sagging hollows in the landscape?</p><p>But after reading Charles King’s <em>Every Valley: The Story of Handel’s Messiah</em>, I have been con

<p>“Ruben Amorim, Ruben Amorim, nananaanananaaa” chorused the jubilant Manchester United fans following the impressive Joshua Zirkzee’s second goal. Sung to the melody of KC and the Sunshine Band’s Give It Up, this was the last thing the new manager’s players did: fail to go after any apparent lost cause just in case gold could be mined.</p><p>It was how Zirkzee struck United’s fourth. From deep in his area the replacement Luke Shaw headed out. The ball came to Amad Diallo who rolled it along the right wing into space. Over thundered Marcus Rashford who failed to connect but, when the ball was passed back to James Tarkowski, there was Diallo harrying. Everton’s captain dawdled, the right wingback pilfered possession, sprinted ahead, squared left to United’s centre-forward, and he rammed home.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/dec/01/manchester-united-everton-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

Born in Albany, New York, Gossett received her diagnosis in 1918 when diabetes had no known treatment. Tragically, her life expectancy was just a matter of months. Her parents desperately searched for any way to keep their daughter alive. A New Jersey physician had developed a radical course of action: keeping the blood sugar levels of diabetic children low by feeding them the bare minimum needed to survive. This could see a prognosis of months extended to years. These young patients weren’t exactly <em>living, </em>but they were alive.</p><p>In the spring of 1919, Gossett went into this starvation clinic. She’d have been constantly cold and hungry.

<p>Some experts say the values of fun and personal development in youth sports are being replaced by performance and victory</p><p>My boyfriend’s parents coached youth sports teams in the 90s, so they have many anecdotes about how children handle winning and losing. Two cousins on separate soccer teams were so competitive that the one who lost would refuse the post-game high-five, instead retreating to some nearby bushes to cry. A little girl used to kick opponents with her ice skates during hockey; another refused to pass because her dad gave her cash for every goal she scored. One boy, when his team lost, lay flat out on the ice and simply wouldn’t get up.</p><p>There’s a general consensus that, in addition to boosting fitness, youth sports impart valuable life skills, like teamwork and discipline. Winning and losing are especially significant, because they prepare children for the setbacks and challenges they will face in adult life.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wellne

Now smartly retitled as <em>Troll: A Love Story</em>, and with only the odd reference to Windows 98 and CD-Roms to show&nbsp;its age, Finnish&nbsp;novelist Johanna Sinisalo’s&nbsp;debut feels fresh and bright.</p><p>It’s set in a world like ours but for one precise adjustment. In the Finland of the novel, trolls, rather than living under bridges in&nbsp;children’s books, are real creatures. The result of “convergent evolution” with primates, they have “pseudo-humanoid external characteristics” and were discovered&nbsp;living in the wild in the early 20th century.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/dec/01/troll

They sizzle and soak up the butter and oil, and I stir them as they slowly turn crisp and golden. The crumbs, hot from the pan, will be stirred with chopped parsley and scattered over the melting burrata. Sometimes I put lemon zest or a chopped anchovy in, too, but not today. This time, there is pumpkin, cut thickly and mixed with the roots, adding another level of sweetness, but also bringing a soft and fudgy quality.

It accuses the government of having gone back on promises it made during the election campaign and, at the time of writing, it’s got 2.8m signatures, one of them, presumably, Michael Caine’s.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/dec/01/another-election-mr-caine-is-taking-the-mich

<p>Not everyone would want to spend their weekends dressed in a tunic fighting medieval battles, but my love of re-enacting is rooted in keeping history alive</p><p>It is the summer of 1265. I am bottling leeches in an open-air apothecary as a medical apprentice of the church. Minstrels tune their musical instruments and soldiers sharpen their swords. Gloucester has just been captured by Prince Edward, and royal forces are growing in the west of England. The men come to me for yarrow to staunch their bleeding, comfrey to heal their injuries, and sulphur to soothe their sores. I smile at their faith in vinegar, a woman’s touch and prayer. But secretly I long to be a lowly foot soldier, fighting with the men in the mud.</p><p>Eventually, I summon the courage to pick up an axe and infiltrate their ranks. My presence on the battlefield is not as unlikely as it might sound. Some of us, such as Margaret of Beverley, fought. Only a little cross-dressing is required. I swap my ankle-length k

<p>It’s touching the way he wanted to buy me trainers or a laptop, but the piggy bank might not reach that far</p><p>A few weeks ago I turned 39. I know. It’s barely worth mentioning: 39 is a Queen’s Club Championships of a birthday, the kind whose mention simply prompts a conversation about the next one to come. My son, however, started asking about it early. ‘When’s your birthday?’ he asked, four months ago. ‘November,’ I told him. ‘So,’ he asked, ‘in November you’ll be 40?’ ‘No,’ I told him, ‘39. Thirty-nine. I’ll be 39,’ with rather more vehemence than was strictly dignified.</p><p>Soon, he started asking me what I wanted as a gift, and I tried to restrict my answers to things he could manage himself. ‘I’d love it if you wrote me another book about your Lego sets,’ I said, ‘maybe one with me in it.’ He reacted to this low-stakes request as if I’d just demeaned the entire purpose of birthdays and started suggesting more expensive things like ‘trainers’ and ‘laptops’ and – struggli

<p>A spice-laden Scandi alternative to the traditional turkey</p><p>Christmas dinner is taken <em>very</em> seriously in my family, and is more or less the highlight of the entire holidays. I start cooking two days ahead – making stock for gravy, prepping the vegetables and making a start on the pudding, which is always cold rice pudding – all while people are coming and going, peeking into pots and tasting, enjoying the smells of Christmas and drinking port, and often with a Christmas movie playing in the background. That all leads up to the centrepiece of our Christmas meal, the duck, which I take out of the fridge on the morning of the 24th and get ready for the oven. I serve it with red cabbage, kale salad, classic caramel potatoes and a nice gravy, but it’s the crisp, sweet and tender roast duck that binds the entire meal together.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/dec/01/danish-style-roast-christmas-duck-recipe-trine-hahnemann">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Facing an enormous decision about her health filled Kat Lister with wonder at her body’s ability to fight for her</p><p>The 2cm wound to the right of my bellybutton had been oozing for days. A syrupy weep in the well of my abdomen. A surgical pothole so small that it felt almost indulgent to photograph it in my bathroom mirror. As if these tiny keyhole incisions dotted around my swollen stomach – one, two, three, four, five of them – bore no relation to the magnitude of the plunder beneath.</p><p>Magnitude. Or, should I say: weight. “Do you feel lighter?” a friend asked me a week after I had a total colectomy to save my life. To which I replied (somewhat contradictorily): yes and no. It didn’t take long for my doctors to start referring to my large bowel, laden with more than 400 precancerous polyps, as a “heavy burden” – and I think there is something poetic in that choice of words. A flash of humanity in an otherwise sterile place. Which is where I found myself in May last year,

<p>The former Arsenal and England captain believes he has finally ‘grown up’, with ‘no tentacles’ from his troubled past</p><p>Tony Adams has always been a contradiction. He led and captained an elite Arsenal dressing room for 14 years but struggled to care for himself. The epitome of bravery on the pitch and “a scared little boy” off it. A career full of drive and determination but also weak will. These days, the contradictions are softer. An East End boy living in the Cotswolds, a recovered alcoholic happily married to a member of the Teacher’s whisky dynasty. A snappy dresser with a messy haircut. The difference is that, unlike the old days, everything seems to fit.</p><p>“I’ve got no angst of the past any more,” says Adams. “I’ve cleaned that up – I’m 28 years without a drink or a drug.

<p>Fiennes gives one of the performances of the year as a cardinal assailed on all sides in Edward Berger’s elegant adaptation of Robert Harris’s Vatican bestseller</p><p>There are some gloriously showy performance flourishes to be found in Edward Berger’s gripping papacy thriller <em>Conclave</em>. Prising open the doors of the Vatican to reveal the rituals and cynical machinations by which a new pope is chosen, it contains the most passive-aggressive curtsey in cinema history, delivered by the all-seeing Sister Agnes (Isabella Rossellini). This comes just after the good sister has delivered a truth bomb to the assembled cardinals, and it is so weighted with sarcasm that you wonder that her knees don’t buckle.</p><p>Then there’s Sergio Castellitto, playing the hardline Catholic traditionalist Cardinal Tedesco, whose pointed use of his vape at key moments of tension conveys more savage animosity and raw ambition than whole pages of dialogue. Even the silences are loaded with drama. A

<p>Emotional growth should foster better balance and accountability, not avoidance of shared obligations</p><p><em><strong>The question </strong>My husband and I have been together for 20 years and have two children. He worked in the corporate world, which he increasingly hated. He kept leaving and applying for different jobs, none of which worked out, and he said this was because he was constantly overlooked for promotion. Last year he left to retrain as a therapist, something I supported him in. It was agreed I’d financially support us while he trained.<br><br>
  Is it a normal part of both undergoing therapy or training as a therapist to become… well… self-regarding? I am finding him increasingly hard to connect with. He seems to think only about his own needs, his own feelings, and is tuned out of the needs of others. He talks of “doing a lot of work on himself”; takes long walks; plays guitar all day and goes away with his new therapy friends.</em></p><p><em>If I ask him to help

Show me a picture of a steaming bowl of ramen, the burnished rings of chashu pork peeking shyly from the cloudy broth, and I will immediately know that this is the only thing I wish to eat. Forever. Or at least for lunch. The hanging Cantonese roasted ducks, pressing their red and gold breasts to the windows of Chinatown restaurants, aren’t just a serving suggestion to me.

<p>Over 70 years ago, thousands of mixed-race boys and girls were torn from their mothers by order of the state. This week five survivors hope a court will censure Belgium for crimes against humanity</p><p>Monique was three years old when a white man from the government came to her village and changed everything. Everyone came out to see him, including Monique, who, as always, was with her “little auntie”, a girl of nine who was also her best friend. Monique cannot recall what the man looked like, but she remembers how sad everyone was after he had gone. Her mother had tears in her eyes that night. Monique would not see her for a long time.</p><p>The next day, Monique set off early with her uncle, aunt and grandmother on a three-day journey. Travelling on foot and by boat, with Monique in their arms, they went more than 100 miles from her birth village, Babadi, in the southern central Kasaï province in the Belgian Congo, to her new lodgings, the Catholic mission of the sisters of Sai

There was a bit of resistance from New Zealand in the end but not enough to prevent the tourists claiming an eight-wicket win and a one-nil lead in this three-match series.</p><p>The moment came at 2.48pm local time when Jacob Bethell pulled a single to reel in a target of 104 in 12.4 overs. Brydon Carse had earlier been the one to set things in motion, claiming his maiden Test five-wicket haul with figures of six for 42 and so 10 in the match. Throw in an unbeaten 33 with the bat during England’s 449 all out and it made for an impressive outing from Durham’s muscular fast bowler.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/dec/01/jacob-bethell-makes-dynamic-debut-to-blast-england-to-vi
