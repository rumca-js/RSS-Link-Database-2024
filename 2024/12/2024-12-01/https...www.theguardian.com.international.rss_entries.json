I upgraded said gown, incidentally \u2013 on eBay I bought 1 x silky kimono thing, and for the darker months, in which we now find ourselves, something belted and lilac in silk velvet. The plan was that I could always throw it on top of my grumping thermals to add that shard of glamour when the Asda delivery man arrived, but I fear it falls slightly short of the 1930s Hollywood vision I was aiming for, and I look more like \u201ca person going through something\u201d.</p",

This picture was taken in a Manhattan legal office in 1997; it would be safe to say it was not paper-free. Though Tunbj\u00f6rk might not quite have known it at the time, he captured in those pictures enclosed, climate-controlled worlds in mortal jeopardy. New York\u2019s 2002 Smoke Free Air Act, for example, confined to history small men wandering the office with cigars between their teeth; women in pearls surrounded by legal proofs under office tables also became a rarer sight in the new millennium.</p><p>Tunbj\u00f6rk, who died in 2015, did not stage his pictures. He became a modern master of the padded cubicle and the strip light and the ergonomic swivel chair. When his book of office pictures was first published",
