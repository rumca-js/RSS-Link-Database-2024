<p><strong>Ditto </strong>is an elusive Pokémon in <em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/pokemon-go/38713">Pokémon Go</a></em>, as it disguises itself and you can’t actually just catch one straight-up.</p>

<p>In order to find Ditto, you’ll want to find the Pokémon that it currently disguises itself as. For example, you may see a Diglett, and it’ll stay a Diglett once you tap on it, but it’s secretly a Ditto. Once you catch that Pokémon, you’ll be met with an “Oh?” prompt, and it’ll turn into a Ditto — if you’re lucky.</p>
