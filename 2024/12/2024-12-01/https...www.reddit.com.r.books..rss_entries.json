Liquid food drips down from above. Waste drains through a grid on the floor. So begins one of the strangest, most surreal comments on the human experience, on love and hatred and the human ability to find good in any situation, no matter how difficult.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m not the best at reviewing books, honestly the description above from the back cover sets up the story perfectly. The writing is very descriptive and the prose are amazing vivid and disturbing.

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hello readers and welcome to our Weekly FAQ thread! Our topic this week is: How do I get through an uninteresting book? Sometimes we want to read something because we&#39;re &quot;supposed to&quot; and want to say that we did. Or, it&#39;s something that needs to be read for a school assignment. Either way, how do you get through books you find uninteresting?</p> <p>You can view previous FAQ threads <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/wiki/faq\">here</a> in our <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/wiki/index\">wiki</a>.</p> <p>Thank you and enjoy!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/AutoModerator\"> /u/AutoModerator </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h41smj/weekly_faq_thread_december_01_2024_how_do_i_get/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h41smj/weekly_faq_thread_december_01_2024_how_do_i_get/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I know what is going in the story but it&#39;s very very boring. I can&#39;t read it because of the complex words....I have to look again again in dictionary for the words , i just cant read the full page without searching in dictionary. I thought that when paul and his mother will go into the desert it will be very easy to read but it became more complex. I cant understand the places he is explaining... Like &quot;They came to a series of dropping shelves and beyond them, saw a fissure with its ledge outlined by moonshadow leading along the vestibule&quot;. And now i cant understand the part where paul pack is lost in the fissure , how he find it using compass and spice and water. Usually when i like a book i always think about it whole day what is going to happen , also at nights i will think about it , will wake to read at night, my morning",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi. Right now I am building a fantasy TBR list because I am buying a Kobo this December. Yey! I watched TikTok and YouTube videos for fantasy recommendations and top 10 lists. Then I search those books on Goodreads and read the blurb and check the tags if they are romance-heavy because I don&#39;t like my books be heavily influenced by romance. I asked also here a question if Vampires are largely romance as well.</p> <p>Now some of the fantasy books were tagged as LGBT. Please, I am not a homophobe. But I sway away from them because I think that for an LGBT-tagged book, romance must be an essential plot component, and I don&#39;t like that. Is my assumption correct? Do you have any LGBT fantasy recommendations that do not highligt romance? Thanks.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/bluerangeryoshi\"> /u/bluerangeryoshi </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h3qpu4/does_an_",
