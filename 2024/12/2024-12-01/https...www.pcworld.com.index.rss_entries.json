So, when we saw the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-256GB-Ultra-Drive-Type-C/dp/B0CKJ8YDRK/?th=1\">256GB SanDisk Ultra Dual Drive Go for $22.49 on Cyber Monday</a>, we may or may not have done a happy dance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s true that we love any good storage deal we find, but this one\u2019s quite special. That\u2019s because this particular SanDisk model features two connectors \u2014 a USB-A and a Type-C. This immediately makes this flash drive even more useful than it already is simply because you can use it with your computer or your smartphone just as easily.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, since this is a USB 3.2 flash drive, it can reach read speeds of up to 400MB/s, which means you\u2019ll be",

No, really, we have! Because this power bank doesn\u2019t just have a massive capacity, but it also charges by simply being in the sun. The best part is that <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Power-Bank-Solar-Charger-42800mAh-Portable-Built-Flashlight/dp/B0C4JTVBBH?th=1\">it\u2019s only $25.90 at Amazon</a>, a good 28% under its MSRP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s start by saying this power bank has a 42,800mAh capacity. That\u2019s absolutely massive! It\u2019s enough to recharge your phone fully about eight times. This power bank has two USB-A and one USB-C port, so you can charge multiple devices at once.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since durability will obviously be a concern when you\u2019re out and about in nature, you shouldn\u2019t worry about this power bank. It\u2019s not only IP67 waterproof but also drop-proof and dust-proof. However, we\u2019d probably be careful ",
