## Books need trigger warnings

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I understand that triggers can be subjective and vary by people but we all know general triggers from explicit content like SA, death, suicide, abuse, substance use, etc. that are commonly recognized and books should be required to list these as a warning of the content, likes movies do. Additionally, if you’re going to contain explicit content, it is simple to include crisis numbers… if your book is about dying by suicide, how hard is it to include a little “if you have thoughts or feelings of hurting yourself of others, call 988”. Books should have some regulation when covering those types of topics. </p> <p>I don’t want to have to read entire reviews that spoil a book just to get an idea of whether certain triggers may be included. Just my opinion! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/anxiouslurker_485"> /u/anxiouslurker_485 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h4gfnl

## Do You Ever Picture a Different Ending for a Book?

I get why the ending is the way it is, but part of me wonders how the story would have felt if Winston had actually succeeded in resisting the Party.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>5-Stars!</p> <p>This book was a recommendation from Goodreads because I enjoyed A Very Short Stay in Hell by Steven L Peck. The cover kind of grabbed me and the description hooked me:</p> <p>“Three strangers are condemned to live together in darkness, crushed together in a concrete stall so small that they can never sit down. Liquid food drips down from above. Waste drains through a grid on the floor. So begins one of the strangest, most surreal comments on the human experience, on love and hatred and the human ability to find good in any situation, no matter how difficult.”</p> <p>I’m not the best at reviewing books, honestly the description above from the back cover sets up the story perfectly. The writing is very descriptive and the prose are amazing vivid and disturbing. The world the author paints is a nightmare and yet…there’s definitely beauty in the filth. </p> <p>How much did I love this book? It arrived on my doorstep this morning at around

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I was promised great love and a heartbreaking ending, and that’s the only reason i was putting off reading this book. It sounded like just the book that would devastate me. Don’t get me wrong, the book is certainly sad, but in a somber, drab way, not in a heartbreaking, stay with you for a long time after you finished it kind of way.</p> <p>Throughout the entire book bad things just pile on for our protagonist Patroclus. There really aren’t many moments of reprieve, the dread is ever present in the book. The main thing i felt for him is pity and then annoyance for being so passive. The only time he ever showed any agency is when he was following Achilles around, making sure he stayed by his side. </p> <p>When they were in the mountains, with a god who could supposedly teach them anything, any skill, fighting or life, Patroclus apparently didn’t learn much of anything. They were in that cave in the mountains for years. Just the two of them and the tea

I loved Thackerays satirical voice as the narrator.</p> <p>Becky Sharp is as interesting character as they come, I was alternately repulsed and charmed by her cunning and devious methods of getting her own way. I know it’s not made explicit in the book, but I got the impression that she may have been subject to sexual abuse as a child, which informs why she acts the way she does as an adult.</p> <p>1) We’re told she had to coax and cajole all of the men her father was in debt to, and she was surrounded by her fathers adult friends from an early age</p> <p>2) It’s said near the beginning that she was “a woman” from very early in her life</p> <p>3) There’s a passage where it says she’s pondering sadly about the “dark times” in her childhood. This could refer only to poverty, but there are other ways to read it.</p> <p>This tracks

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Has anyone else seen the promotion of this book on Instagram ? I feel like it sounds slightly unique or maybe i just like how the MMC and FMC look in the cover. It reminds me of Anne and Gilbert from Anne of green gables who were also academic rivals that eventually got married.</p> <p>I always find it interesting how some books have kind of a combination between enemies and friends to lovers. Ron and Hermione from Harry Potter and Gilbert and Anne from Anne of Green gables would these be classified as friends to lovers or enemies to lovers? Ron and Hermione were clearly both friends and rivals at the same time whereas I suppose Gilbert and Anne went from rivals to friends to lovers. Except when they were rivals, it was more from Anne&#39;s side than Gilbert. The thing i slightly disliked about Anne and Gilbert is that Gilbert became a doctor and Anne didn&#39;t do much with her career. But in another way, I actually like that the author did that bec

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I love <em>The Hobbit</em>. It is one of my favourite childhood books, and favourite books ever. I read and reread it as a child till I knew chunks of it by heart, I still do. It is part of my emotional / mental landscape, along with a few other works (and unlike that godawful sprawling Lord of the Ring shite, which I sludged through at the age of fifteen out of a sense of duty, and never touched again). When my son was little, I remember telling him bits of <em>The Hobbit</em> (the escape with the eagles, the spiders, Gollum, Smaug) as bedtime stories. </p> <p>So when he (now a 19-year old who of course knows everything about everything) was assigned <em>The Hobbit</em> in a Pop Culture course (he&#39;s in maths, but he needs to take some mandatary writing/humanities credits, and this one happened to fit his schedule), I was delighted. I always love it when my children read the books I did as a child, and I envisaged lots of cozy conversation betwee

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi. Right now I am building a fantasy TBR list because I am buying a Kobo this December. Yey! I watched TikTok and YouTube videos for fantasy recommendations and top 10 lists. Then I search those books on Goodreads and read the blurb and check the tags if they are romance-heavy because I don&#39;t like my books be heavily influenced by romance. I asked also here a question if Vampires are largely romance as well.</p> <p>Now some of the fantasy books were tagged as LGBT. Please, I am not a homophobe. But I sway away from them because I think that for an LGBT-tagged book, romance must be an essential plot component, and I don&#39;t like that. Is my assumption correct? Do you have any LGBT fantasy recommendations that do not highligt romance?
