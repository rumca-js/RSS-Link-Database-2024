I went to an event yesterday that was advertised as being a casual fun event, it was a doubles tournament with fun missions that weren’t part of the usual game. The organizer really really stressed that the event was supposed to just be a fun day of playing 40k and hoped it would draw in new people as well, there was even prize money for the top placing people.
