Grand Antique marble, from the Pyrenees Mountains, is renowned for its naturally occurring stark black-and-white contrast. It's been in demand among the elite as early as antiquity. The Romans quarried it for centuries, and it's featured in St. Markâ€™s Basilica in Venice, as well as Joseph Napoleon's tomb. But mining this marble ground to a halt nearly 70 years ago, until a quarryman rediscovered it. Now, a square meter of Grand Antique costs nearly $2,000.
