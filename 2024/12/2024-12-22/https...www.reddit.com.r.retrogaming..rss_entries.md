## Something about the history of video games I find interesting is how it kind of started with the original Pong

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Sorry if that was obvious, but I was just trying to observe the history of the medium itself as what I always enjoy learning is seeing how video games were created as a form of media as I wanted to see how the medium had taken off basically.</p> <p>So I wanted to look at the original Pong to see just made the game so iconic that it would eventually kickstart the concept of interactive media as I wanted to discuss the game to understand the evolution of again the medium as correct me if I am wrong, but there weren’t many games available when that particular game was first released, so I wonder how the concept of video games would slowly evolve from there.</p> <p>Sorry if my post was a bit eccentric, but to put it simply, I just wanted to have a simple discussion on the history of video games as a medium to see how the medium was first established as I wanted to first start with Pong to see how it all started.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted b
