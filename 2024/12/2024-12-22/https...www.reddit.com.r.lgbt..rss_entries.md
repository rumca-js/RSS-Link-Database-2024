We always have so much fun together and every time we have our lunch together we talk about anything and everything. She always rants to me about her quirky hobbies, and ”bullies” me for being shorter and younger than her. She recently drew a picture of us 🥹 Today when we were talking and joking around she just looked at my lips and then asked if I was wearing lipstick (I usually don’t), I said yes and she told me it looked great. I know it would a horrible idea to date a co-worker but i just want to know if she likes me back or if i’m crazy. Maybe she just likes me as a friend?

My name is Natalie, and I use she/her/they pronouns. </p> <p>Wow, that was...new. But it felt good. </p> <p>Any advice, or thoughts would be greatly appreciated.

He feels trapped into tea parties and dancing lessons which make him giddy. He&#39;s not a girl. He doesn&#39;t want to be treated like one. This is just my interpretation. Feel free to disagree. I&#39;m not saying he is trans I&#39;m saying he shares feelings and such that many trans teens and adults a like could probably relate to. Think of Dipper from Gravity Falls and how he constantly wants to prove his masculinity. I think both are semi similar and both are experiences many people could relate to as trans people.

We will stand together, and we will get through this.
