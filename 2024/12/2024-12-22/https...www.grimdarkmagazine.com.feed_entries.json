        "description": "<p>The sheer audacity of Kajornwan, formerly writing as Sienna Frost, to first publish an absolute masterpiece of a debut novel in Obsidian: Awakening, only to follow that up with a sequel in Obsidian: Revelation that just elevates the entire story to an unparalleled level of grimdark storytelling genius. As the title suggests, this is a sequel full of revelations, but more than that, it\u2019s a sequel of consequences, endurance, trauma, painful growth, tentative hope, love, heartbreak, and just the most exquisite emotional turmoil. \u201cI come from the desert. My people are prepared to die for something as fragile as honor and pride, however hard that is for a Rashai or a Samarran to understand. You can\u2019t threaten us with death. It doesn\u2019t work that way.\u201d Now, as much as I gushed in my review of Obsidian: Awakening over on Before We Go Blog, there is no denying that it\u2019s quite a slow-burn and boldly unconventional set-up book for the rest of the series. Yet those who have faith in Kajornwan",
