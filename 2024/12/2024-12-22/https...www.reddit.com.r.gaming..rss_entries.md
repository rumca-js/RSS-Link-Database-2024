## The value of items in RPG's (Inventory says it's worth 1000 but it only sells for 100)

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t understand why games do this, but it feels like almost every RPG has something akin to this issue.</p> <p>You&#39;re playing a game and you have an item in your inventory that says it&#39;s value is around 500 gold, then you bring it to a merchant and they&#39;re like &quot;Best I can do is a stale piece of bread.&quot;</p> <p>Why do RPG&#39;s do this? Why not just tell me the actual amount I will be able to sell the item for? What gameplay purpose does it serve? As far as I know, you can&#39;t win favor in Witcher 3 with merchants to get better buying/selling prices. The price they offer when you first meet them is the price they&#39;ll offer no matter how many quests you do. So if the price is set in stone, why is the described price in my inventory not the actual selling price?</p> <p>It&#39;s not just Witcher 3 that does this. It&#39;s true in nearly every RPG that tells you what an item is &quot;worth&quot; but it&#39;s never ACTUALL

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So this might be an odd recommendation as it’s a few years old, pretty well known with pretty solid reviews. I’d just somehow completely missed out on this amazing game and I had just been enjoying it so much I just wanted to recommend it for others who may have missed it. Lot of community overlap with Deep Rock Galactic so if you like that game you will probably like this one.</p> <p>For those that have not heard of it Vermintide 2 is a multiplayer coop game although it can also be played solo absolutely fine. While I think it’s most fun played with friends, queue times for playing with random people is only a few seconds or you can just go at it solo with the use of bots that you gear, choose talents for etc.</p> <p>The gameplay is pretty much a medieval fantasy (warhammer) mixed with Left 4 Dead. The 4 of you need to do objectives and get to the end of the map. While fighting hordes of rat men and all sorts of evil.</p> <p>Outside of that you chil

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Game UIs are a varied bunch and icons demoting your available weapons are no different. Depending on the game in question, the icon for your currently equipped weapon may have a constant presence in the game’s UI or it briefly flashes whenever you make a switch (much more likely encountered nowadays given trend for minimalistic UIs in general though there’s definitely older examples to be found as well). A good example of this is Shadow of the Colossus and it’s PS4 remake where the weapon was always visible in the original version and disappears on Switch in the latter. Note that this only about the icons and not additional information such as ammo counters.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Rebatsune"> /u/Rebatsune </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1hjzhl0/whats_your_take_on_weapon_icons_constantly_being/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.c

## Are you guys sick of "Unreal look" in the recent games or is it just me? What are some really visually striking photo-realistic (-ish) games in the indie scene?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So many games nowadays are trying to resemble reality using a single engine: Unreal Engine 5. I have no issues with realistic-looking games(I mean, I love films) but so many of them lack a clear artistic &quot;visual&quot; vision such as a meaningful color palette or well-thought-out composition. They wanna look like reality, and reality can only look one way without artistic direction - boring. </p> <p>Not to mention that many games just use default Unreal post-processing settings and the same assets, to the point that you can just tell it&#39;s a game made in Unreal with a glance. This problem gets worse when it comes to indie games since they have more asset-flippy games and lean on the more default Unreal visual styles. Games like &quot;Deep Rock Galactic&quot; or &quot;Sifu&quot; are BEAUTIFUL since they found a way to create their own style. </p> <p>Its somewhat of a reverse problem to the &quot;oh this game is made with Unity&quot;.
