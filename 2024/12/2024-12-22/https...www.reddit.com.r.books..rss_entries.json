I read this book during a very tough time of my life, where I was facing a crisis and the world around me was collapsing. By no means things are the best now, but life is getting better, the trajectory of life and it&#39;s vicious cycle of pain, joy, happiness, desolation, madness and torment. During such hard times, Ocean Vuong was there by my side, with his words, with his texts, with his novel that displayed how unjust, cruel and painful our lives might be, but there&#39;s still hope. A lingering trail of aspiration and hope that our heart choses to believe on, choses to hold on to. That it gave me the strength and hopes to hold on to, and to keep fighting and to never lose the faith in myself. This novel connected so much with me and my emotions that I feel helpless now, because I can&#39;t comprehend with words how much this book meant to me and how blessed ",

Having seen a lot of readers flat out admit it got them into fantasy it seems the book strengths lie at being really accessible. </p> <p>But like other more famous fantasy&#39;s Seires has a lot of side lore within the book for readers to ponder on . Characters and inner factions the books always seem to add a new mystery or angle . </p> <p>Id argue while it&#39;s main character may be rather simple, they are very determined and that energy does transfer over to the reader to continue pushing further along the pages .</p> <p>Add in Dragons Bieng cent",

Like between people who liked genre fiction vs. those who read the classics. Or one type of genre fiction vs. another. Or rejecting someone just because they read a book by a disliked author or on a taboo subject or whatever. Felt like high school when you could get rejected if you said you liked, say, a new age musician (as opposed to rock music or something).</p> <p>I still feel quite wary about mentioning the books I have enjoyed reading, always worrying someone is gonna come out and judge me harshly and say, &quot;How the hell can you like that garbage? I mean you are entitled to your opinion...but damn!&quot;</p> <p>I think a better question to ask, when someone talks about liking a book that you did not or the kind of book you would not read, is, &quot;What did you like about it the most?&quot;</",
