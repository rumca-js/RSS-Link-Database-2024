On January 31 2001, Peter Moore, Sega of America\u2019s senior vice president of marketing, announced to the world that SEGA was getting out of the console business after an 18-year era of Sega hardware, which included four of the best gaming consoles of all time.\n\nIt\u2019s tempting to blame the death of the SEGA Dreamcast on something easy and obvious like the impending PS2 (PlayStation 2) spooking prospective buyers. But from speaking to Peter Moore, it\u2019s clear the Dreamcast\u2019s death was complicated, messy, and inevitable. \n\nIn this Peter Moore interview and Simon Cox interview (former editor-in-chief of Official Dreamcast Magazine), the pair share with us all the vital moments that led up to the end of the Sega Dreamcast, including the unrelenting power of competition from Sony's PlayStation 2 and Microsoft's Xbox, a lack of third-party support, and an industry shift towards Western-style games like GTA 3 (Grand Theft Auto 3).\n\nDid you enjoy our video cov",
