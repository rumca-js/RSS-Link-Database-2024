<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I came across Jellyfish a couple of weeks ago and was in AWE over how good they were, but after weeks of searching ive never seen anyone talk about the band at all??? I was instantly hooked on the song &#39;&#39;brighter day&#39;&#39; since it became absolute gold like 40 seconds in. Yeah the song is super long, but its also super worth listening to. Skimming through other songs made me realize that it had a lot of similarities with music from queen with a switch of direction, wide range of instrumentals and honestly pretty inspiring music. At first i thought it was some new underground band and was stoked, but quickly realized it was an inactive band who&#39;s been on haitus since 2006.</p> <p>Has anyone heard of the band? I&#39;ve been DYING to talk to someone about them!!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/kiwibx3"> /u/kiwibx3 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1hk9

For a metal show???? $300 for a fkn metal show are you kidding, that kind of money for any show is crazy, I just can&#39;t believe that live music, which used to be such a beautiful and therapeutic experience for all, now became an elitist capitalist scam for only those who have big money.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have been learning to play the piano and teaching myself music production on ableton for almost the past year. Until now I have been using an actual piano for practice and a Novation launch key mini for production. Lately I have been wanting a keyboard/synthesizer so I can play with headphones on and due to the launch key not having enough keys and being too sensitive. I am looking for something that can be used for both playing and music production in the price range from 300-500$. I’m looking for neo soul sound such as old Rhodes or something familiar to sounds found on albums like flower boy by Tyler, return of the space cowboy by Jamiroquai, mama’s gun by erykah or charm by Clario. Any recommendations or advice? </p> <p>Thank you! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/No-Distance-636"> /u/No-Distance-636 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1hjrj9o/advice_on_keyboard
