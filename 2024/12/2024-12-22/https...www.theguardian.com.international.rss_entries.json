The verdict was justifiably much more clear-cut than the split-decision ruling which had also given Usyk victory in May.</p><p>But Fury offered his contrasting belief at the post-fight press conference: \u201cI thought I won that fight. I thought I won both fights but I\u2019m going home with two losses on my record. There\u2019s not much I can do about it. I can just fight my heart out.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/dec/22/i-won-that-fight-tyson-fury-rejects-defeat-as-judges-christmas-gift-to-oleksandr-usyk\">Continue reading...</a>",
