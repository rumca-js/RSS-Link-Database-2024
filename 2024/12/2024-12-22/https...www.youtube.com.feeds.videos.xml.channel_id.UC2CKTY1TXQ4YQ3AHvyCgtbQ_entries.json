        "description": "We're closing out one year of wargaming and heading into another - 2025! I'll talk about the year that was and what I'd like to see in wargaming for 2025 - and maybe some things I'm planning for the channel in the coming year. And of course, I'll answer your wargaming-related question. Come have fun!\n\nVince Venturella and I made another game! Check out Deth Wizards - miniatures-agnostic necromantic skirmish combat at http://www.dethwizardsgame.com\n\nI'm a member of The Army Painter Factory Team - and I'm passing the savings on to you!
