<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone,</p> <p>I&#39;m running TuxedoOS (based on Ubuntu) on a laptop with a hybrid GPU setup (Intel integrated + NVIDIA RTX 4070). NVIDIA is set as the default GPU. I&#39;m using Wayland but also tested with X11, and I face the same issue.</p> <p>I installed Steam and Silent Hill 2 remake) and selected both Proton Experimental and Proton 9 to run the game. While all my other games run perfectly, this one has extremely poor performance, as if it&#39;s ignoring the NVIDIA GPU and defaulting to the Intel integrated graphics.</p> <p>Here’s what I’ve tried so far:</p> <ol> <li>Reinstalled the NVIDIA drivers.</li> <li>Created a <code>dxvk.conf</code> file and set VRAM to 8GB.</li> <li>Tested the game on both Wayland and X11 (same result).</li> </ol> <p>Despite all this, the performance remains slow. Does anyone have any ideas or suggestions on how to resolve this?</p> <p>Thanks in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="ht

I&#39;ve tried various versions of proton for various games and none of them seem to work. Even games that are labelled as &quot;native&quot; on protondb just won&#39;t run. The typical process looks like this:</p> <ol> <li><p>download game</p></li> <li><p>click play</p></li> <li><p>it says im playing it - my status changes on steam and the play button becomes &quot;close&quot;</p></li> <li><p>after about 10 seconds it just says play and my status reverts back to online</p></li> </ol> <p>i&#39;ve tried reinstalling and have also tried the flatpak version of steam and nothing seems to be fixing it - i&#39;ve had zero issues with my system besides from this and other games that arent on steam run absolutely fine!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/MothMilk

My performance in general is pretty stuttery, this has somewhat been alleviated when I downloaded the GE proton, though it still isn&#39;t very smooth. If someone wants to give any suggestions, God bless you and let me know if you need more info.</p> <p>Also, this has probably been answered many times before but I haven&#39;t been able to find a straight answer, but is there anything I can do about the game downloads after closing the game? Every time I close the game, there will be about 1GB of updates to download. This is the same when I turn on my PC, sometimes it&#39;s more than 1GB. When I mouse over it is shader pre-caching or something, I don&#39;t know much about it. But I have very bad internet

Watching MangoHUD (thank Gawd for MangoHUD) I noticed that it was reporting the game as using llvmpipe/Mesa as opposed to the usual Nvidia drivers, fps was around 9 fps before crashing back to the desktop.</p> <p>I tried other games, every other game launched fine using the Nvidia drivers.

If I&#39;m not moving at all the frames will go back to normal and stop being choppy, but as soon as I make an input it gets super laggy again.
