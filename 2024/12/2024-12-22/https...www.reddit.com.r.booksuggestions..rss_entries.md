## Looking for post-apocalyptic books that aren't too dark or tragic

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m looking for post-apocalyptic type books that focus on the rebuilding of society or community and not any graphic violent, war torn aftermath of gangs or evil groups trying to control what&#39;s left of humanity. I listened to an audio drama set after an apocalyptic event that worked out the majority of humans. It focused on a small group of people just trying to survive off the land again and getting along with each other. There was some drama involved and then meeting another group of people but it all focused on them preventing conflicts and instead helping others. I want to read more books like that. I don&#39;t mind having some drama of possible war or major conflicts or something but that shouldn&#39;t be the main focus. </p> <p>Any recommendations would be much appreciated!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/CosmicMando"> /u/CosmicMando </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/

The movie that sparked this question was Gone Girl. I watched it last night and Rosamund Pike&#39;s performance was...absolutely mesmerizing.

Carry On (MC discovers he’s into guys as he spends more time with the secondary protagonist), Heartstopper (gay guy crushing on a suspected straight classmate who discovers he is bi), Coffee Boy (queer trans man crushing on a guy and slowly realizes he’s into guys too), Wolfsong and Bear Otter and the kid where the MC slowly realizes he’s bi (although more into books where the MC is known queer and it’s about the discovery of the other guy), even of note are several Sherlock Holmes fanfics where Holmes is into Watson and Watson slowly discovers he is bi, or reveals to Holmes he’s bi as well. I think as a queer guy this sort of dynamic is super relatable.

Do you have any suggestions? My reader loves Jane Austen, nature, and Scotland. I had planned to get Sara Baume’s “Seven Steeples” but no nearby stores have it in stock.

Im trying to get back into reading as a form of grounding myself again because I feel like I’m constantly on a roller coaster of emotions since having the baby, but I think I’m needing a hard-hitting book to get me back into it. One of my favorite books ever was Being Mortal by Atul Gawande (I was a med student) and I’m looking for something to give me the similar feeling of happiness and wanting to ugly cry at the same time. But also nothing too harsh because I’m in a bit of a fragile state at the moment? Hope that makes sense.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello everyone! I’m hoping the glorious book lovers can lend me a hand last minute for Christmas. It has come to my attention that my dad may be slacking this year for my mom and so I’m looking suggestions that he would likely find in store. I know Target tends to do deals this time of year but anywhere is appreciated. My mom mentioned a new Nicholas sparks book, I believe it’s called counting miracles. I was going to point him to that. She has always liked Nicholas sparks, Nora Roberts and James Patterson. Anything in those vibes would likely fit the bill. Sadly most of James Patterson recent books she already has. </p> <p>Thanks in advance everyone! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Curious_Bread_9057"> /u/Curious_Bread_9057 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1hjmlq5/book_suggestions_for_mom/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/
