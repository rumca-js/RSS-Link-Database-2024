<p>I couldn’t believe my eyes when I spotted the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Portable-External-MU-PH8T0S-AM/dp/B0CMDGGJTZ/">8TB Samsung T5 EVO portable SSD for just $400 right now</a> because that’s, by far, the best discount I’ve ever seen for it. (Before that, its best price was $430, so it’s quite the drop ahead of the holidays.)</p>



<p>We <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2124646/samsung-t5-evo-usb-ssd-review.html">reviewed the Samsung T5 EVO</a> some time ago and gave it a 4-star rating for its small and rugged body plus its decently fast performance. “The T5 EVO is 5Gbps (Gen 1) USB 3.2, meaning that no matter what’s inside, it’s basically capped at 550MB/s.”</p>

<p>We expect USB-C cables to perform a specific task: transferring either data or files between devices. We give little more thought to the matter, but malicious USB-C cables can do much more than what we expect.</p>



<p>These cables hide malicious hardware that can intercept data, eavesdrop on phone calls and messages, or, in the worst cases, take complete control of your PC or cellphone. The first of these appeared in 2008, but back then they were very rare and expensive — which meant the average user was largely safeguarded.</p>



<p>Since then, their availability has increased 100-fold and now with both specialist spy retailers selling them as “spy cables” as well as unscrupulous sellers passing them off as legitimate products, it’s all too easy to buy one by accident and get hacked. So, how do you know if your USB-C cable is malicious?</p>

<p>It’s getting late for online gift buying, and the holidays are imminent. If you’ve missed those shipping deadlines, you have one last resort – gift cards.</p>



<p>Yes, yes, we know, they’re not as personal, but they’re better than being empty-handed when your friend or family member tosses you a gift. And if we’re being fair, sometimes, gift cards are better than actually spending money on something your loved ones may not like, may not need, or may already have. In this way, whomever it is you’re shopping for has the chance to buy something they actually want.</p>



<p>From Amazon to Fortnite, from Best Buy to IKEA and Wendy’s, here’s a list of the best last-minute eGift cards we could find for you today.</p>
