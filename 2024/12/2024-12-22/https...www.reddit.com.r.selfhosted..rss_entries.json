        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi Folks, I currently have an old laptop I have repurposed for hosting some apps, until lately my ISP used to give an /64 ipv6 address that I used to connect the server remotely, but they don&#39;t anymore. Latency is not much of trouble for me since I&#39;m just using my server as a sync server for my laptop backups. As a resort I hope to do something like this, buy a basic vm with a public ip to host a proxy (Or maybe use Oracle Free Tier). Basically I would be connecting to a VPN (that connects to vm) on my computer, and then proxy the data to my server at home (there would be a connection from my home server to the VPN server), and somehow proxy all requests from my computer to my server at home. Not sure how I would achieve this, so any suggestions are welcome. Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/me_crdy\"> /u/me_crdy </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/",
