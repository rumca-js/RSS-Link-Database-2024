<p>Spurs can win spectacularly and are fun but they could have had Arne Slot in 2023 and instead have the same pot of relaunched stasis</p><p>Liverpool are serious about this. They’re not in London for souvenirs or sightseeing. They had a game four days earlier, they’ve got another in four days’ time, and so all they really want for Christmas is to get in, get the points and get out. They’d rather do it clean. But they’ll do it dirty if they have to.</p><p>Above all, they know exactly what they want. Luis Díaz wants to spin off his man and run from deep, and Ryan Gravenberch wants to plug the gaps and get the ball moving, Dominik Szoboszlai wants you to commit, but not until he’s put you half a step off balance first, and Mo Salah wants to be Mo Salah. They can go short or long, hit you from every angle, hurt you from every bit of the pitch. Nine Liverpool players made a key pass in this game, including the goalkeeper and both full-backs.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/foot

<p>It turns out it wasn’t so hard after all. Southampton stopped giving the ball away in their own half, adopted an approach rooted in expediency and kept their second clean sheet of the campaign. Salvation remains a long way distant but a point, just the second they have taken away from home this season, means there is at least something to build on in the post-Russell Martin era.</p><p>Southampton’s new coach Ivan Juric, who signed an 18-month contract on Friday, was in the stand at Craven Cottage, peering through the bitter rain driving down the Thames as Simon Rusk conducted affairs from the dugout. What he oversaw was 90 minutes of very little. Even the arrival, for his league debut, of the winger Martial Godo, for which everybody has been waiting, failed to bring anything approaching resolution.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/dec/22/fulham-southampton-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

They have always been there, the women tell Jim, but just haven’t been well documented. Playwright Hannah Khalil is rectifying this in her retelling of Robert Louis Stevenson’s classic by combining his tale of buccaneers and buried gold with that of 19th-century female sailors – but without making it a jarring history lesson.</p><p>It is structured as a relived memory for Jim, who is looking to the moment an old shipmate of Captain Flint enters his mother’s inn and dies. That death sets off the discovery of Flint’s map containing the location of hidden treasure, and the expedition to find it by a ragtag fleet of sailors. Among them is Long John Silver, the pirate d

<p>What’s more depressing than the thought of a long, slow decline in health? The thought of several short, sharp declines. Thank you, science!</p><p>I don’t believe ageing is linear: I reckon we have long plateaux, then everything falls apart all at once. I realised this at the close of my harrowing 31st year, when I looked in the mirror and didn’t recognise the sad, grey ghost staring back. I swear one day I was young and moderately dewy with a functioning musculoskeletal system; the next my face imploded, shortly followed by my knee (yes, it was a fun year). There’s a phrase for this kind of sudden ageing in French: <em>prendre un coup de vieux</em>, which feels appropriate, since I was living in France during that first precipitous decline and prolonged exposure to the angry rigours of Parisian life was at least partly to blame.</p><p>Anyway, now science is catching up.

<p>It can be a real winner at this time of year</p><p>It’s very hard to recommend chocolate for this time of year. If you haven’t bought any for presents, then you really are down to local shops.

I don’t know if it was planned or last minute, but it was a real winner.</p><p>This year the number one last-minute question I’ve been asked is: ‘Can you recommend where I can buy a large box of good, assorted chocolates?’ This is where your chocolatier nearby comes in and you’d be surprised how many there are, from <strong><a href="https://www.mochachocolateshop.co.ukhttps//www.chococo.co.uk/?gad_source=1&amp;gbraid=0AAAAADPfCGO9FYRGJkcK67YnYyO2b4-kw&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAlsy5BhDeARIsABRc6ZsesrA5zujcdmCLl2AtqCykxKKCr8TlMUu1qt4oGHRAG1ffZVwMsyIaApAYEALw_wcB">Mocha</a></strong> in Yorkshire to <strong><a href="https://www.chococo.co.uk/?gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAgJa6BhCOARIsAMiL7V9FDB3

<p>In choosing the UK’s new ambassador, Keir Starmer is gambling that the rewards will justify the risks</p><p>From Prince of Darkness to deputy prime minister to Your Excellency.

<p>Female athlete power on social media became ever more strident in 2024 – but the backlash also damaged careers and wellbeing</p><p>Lina Nielsen remembers the moment she had the idea. She was sitting around the Olympic Village in Paris with her sprinting teammates – and she was bored. “I said to Yemi Mary John: ‘I’m gonna make this TikTok’,” Nielsen recalls.

Holla at me.”</p><p>Her five-second spoof of Kelly Rowland’s music-video texting fail took hardly longer than that to make. It also got 8m views. “It’s funny that the videos that do that best are the ones you don’t put any effort in,” says Nielsen with a laugh. She is still trying to make sense of the fact that her TikTok channel was the most popular of any British athlete at the Games, beating even the knit-tastic Tom Daley in second place.

<p>Sometimes the perfect present is a timely reminder that, even when it absolutely seems like it, all is not lost</p><p>I discovered the perfect Christmas present at work the other day after eating fish and chips too fast. I was wearing too many layers for the office, where heating is pumped from unusual angles bringing with it the smell of lasagne or sewer, and I was sweating. Partly, it was the layers, partly it was the meeting due in five minutes, which was about the future of our jobs, and I was in a rush to get a seat at our possible execution. By the sinks I removed a jumper and washed my hands, and joined my colleagues in a bright glass room. But, as the meeting began and my hands became fists, I realised something awful. I was missing a ring from my little finger. It was small and silver, in the shape of a tiny safety pin – I’d bought it 20 years ago on my first week at work and worn it every day since. Its loss struck me as ominous.</p><p>I am largely anti-Christmas present

The 32-year-old comedian grew up in Auckland: her father is Samoan, her mother Scottish-Croatian. “Because my parents are Rastafarian, and I was brought up Rastafarian, it was seen as a bit of a pagan ritual, as my dad would say,” she recalls. “So we never had a Christmas tree. And on the day, as kids, we would go to the $2 shop, which is quite a famous shop in New Zealand, and we’d all buy each other a $2 gift. And mum would get each of us kids a big packet of crisps, a 2.25-litre bottle of fizzy drink and some sweets. That was kind of Christmas.”</p><p>That sounds… sort of brilliant? “When you’re a kid that’s the jackpot,” she nods. “You’re like, ‘My own personal crappy food!

It’s not simply that on this grey November lunchtime, the vent to our left is pumping frigid air into the room, as if they failed to notice the clocks went back weeks ago. It’s also the hard-lined space with the slab-like picture windows looking out on to St Swithin’s Lane. It’s the parquet and the bright lights, the hefty chairs upholstered in a frosty shade of cadet blue, and the desperate attempt to soften everything with a large fern imprint on a taupe wall. The tables are set just far enough apart so diners can plot against their rivals and mutter “your shout or mine” at each other without being overheard. It feels like an overworke

<p>Perfect pairings for those seasonal get-togethers</p><p><strong>MOMO Carmelo’s Green Mandarin Kombucha (£28 for six 33cl bottles, <a href="http://momo-kombucha.com/">momo-kombucha.com</a>) </strong>From the disappointing tangerine at the bottom of the stocking to the peel in the mulled wine and the Christmas cake, citrus, and specifically orange citrus, is, to use the cheffy vernacular, one of the “signature flavours” of the season. That’s one of the reasons why I reckon the latest inventive concoction from MOMO, one of my favourite kombucha producers, is going to be my go-to fancy no-low drink for those moments over the next couple of weeks when the thought of more booze palls. It’s a collaboration with the upmarket greengrocer Natoora, who bring in the Tardivo di Ciaculli Mandarins that the kombucha is made with from the titular Sicilian grower Carmelo, who picks them weeks ahead of schedule to give them their extra wince and zing and green colour. The drink itself is dry and al

<p>Give yourself permission to grieve, not just for the end of your marriage, but also for the man you thought you knew</p><p><em><strong>The question</strong></em> <em>Last Christmas, my husband left me. He’d been on a few festive nights out with work and I noticed a change in his behaviour. When I asked what was wrong, he told me that a conversation we’d had a couple of months previously, whereby I talked about divorce, had been playing on his mind. I didn’t want a divorce, but I was just trying to get him to see that I felt he was neglecting me with his obsession over losing weight (which he didn’t need to lose) and exercising. Before the exercise obsession started he was my best friend and supporter, so this was such a shock.</em></p><p><em>He never grieved for his father – a very difficult man – who died earlier in the year. The day after he left he sent an email saying he couldn’t stop thinking of me talking about divorce and he wanted to separate. I was shattered by this. Wher

Latkes and smoked salmon are served before homemade cranberry sauce and brussels sprouts. My dad’s hand-painted menorah, which he made during the ceramics cafe boom of the early 2000s, sits proudly underneath the Christmas tree.</p><p>As such, I had never missed a Christmas with the family – although there had been some near misses. In 2019, we spent Christmas by my dad’s hospital bed after his stroke – us sipping on hospital canteen gingerbread lattes, him having Christmas dinner in the guise of vanilla-scented protein, fed through a tube. In 2020, I saw my family only from six feet away, double-masked and on the doorstep. I delivered presents, but they were not opened for a few days, to let any stray virus dissipate.</p> <a href="https:/

<p>Apps like Depop and Vinted are hugely popular, but an online culture of scams, rage and suspicion is now the default between buyers and sellers, with communications quickly descending into hurling abuse at a stranger</p><p>Here is a real-life conversation on a secondhand shopping app: a buyer of two items asks if a seller could combine postage costs. The petulant seller refuses. After a grating plea from the buyer, the seller retorts, “Fine, I’ll refund you, but I’m doing it my way.” Eventually, the buyer receives a large piece of card with a load of grubby coppers stuck to it with Sellotape. On the back it says, “Enjoy the refund!”</p><p>And there’s nothing odd about this – these sorts of exchanges between Brits on marketplace apps are so commonplace they have become part of the texture of the shopping experience. Maybe even part of the fun. But why do we communicate like this? What is happening that we can’t be remotely polite and <em>normal</em>? Where have our famous manners g
