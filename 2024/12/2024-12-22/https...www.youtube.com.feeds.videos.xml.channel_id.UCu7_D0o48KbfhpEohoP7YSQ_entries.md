Most of us know Node-Red. Today, I will show you Node-Red on steroids. It is called n8n, is the new kid on the block, and has much potential. Because it is also fun to play with, we have to have a closer look at it. It is a direct competitor to Zapier, but open source and free to use if you know how. Join me if you want to get an introduction to this new tech and learn where it can work for you and what hurdles you must pass if you want to use it. It will save you some detours.
