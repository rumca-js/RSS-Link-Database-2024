(Before that, its best price was $430, so it\u2019s quite the drop ahead of the holidays.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/2124646/samsung-t5-evo-usb-ssd-review.html\">reviewed the Samsung T5 EVO</a> some time ago and gave it a 4-star rating for its small and rugged body plus its decently fast performance. \u201cThe T5 EVO is 5Gbps (Gen 1) USB 3.2, meaning that no matter what\u2019s inside, it\u2019s basically capped at 550MB/s.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Basically, while it may not be rocket-fast, it\u2019s one of the few reliable portable SSDs to come in an enormous 8TB version.

We give little more thought to the matter, but malicious USB-C cables can do much more than what we expect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These cables hide malicious hardware that can intercept data, eavesdrop on phone calls and messages, or, in the worst cases, take complete control of your PC or cellphone. The first of these appeared in 2008, but back then they were very rare and expensive \u2014 which meant the average user was largely safeguarded.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since then, their availability has increased 100-fold and now with both specialist spy retailers selling them as \u201cspy cables\u201d as well as unscrupulous sellers passing them off as legitimate products, it\u2019s all too easy to buy one by accident and get hacked. So, how do you know if your USB-C cable is malicious?</p>\n\n\n\n<blockqu",
