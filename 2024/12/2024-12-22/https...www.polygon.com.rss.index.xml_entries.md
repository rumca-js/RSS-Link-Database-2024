From the famous failings of video game movie adaptations to the even <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23452779/netflix-video-game-movies-shows-anime-list-release-dates">more famous struggle</a> to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-watch/23196727/best-video-game-movies-adaptations-tv-watch-streaming">make good movie versions of games</a>, it’s rare that the two mediums see eye to eye.

Fans considered it a black mark on George Lucas’ franchise, and made it the butt of endless fandom jokes. But that’s changed over the past decade — Lucasfilm has been quietly honoring the holiday special and bringing elements from it into the canon. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/486655/skeleton-crew-neel-how-vfx-what-is-he"><em>Star Wars: Skeleton Crew</
