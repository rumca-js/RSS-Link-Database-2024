Trying to force my wife). I checked 100 of videos already got a very good foundation about the rules of 40k/aos/kill team but why is it so hard to get started? Why does GW force you to buy 12 books and 5 boxes only to play the game?</p> <p>I rly don’t know what I need to buy/make/print/read/download to actually play. We did already play all the kill team tutorial but it’s clear that the rules are not complete and you don’t play a complete game…</p> <p

## Do Warhammer writers know what a Small Arm is?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Something I hear alot in lore videos and books is &quot;This armor type is immune to or near impervious to small arms!&quot; then some Ork with a baseball bat goes to town on the person wearing it and it&#39;s described as being &quot;Broken and bent in any way that could be distinguished.&quot; Like okay, maybe that Ork was just really throwing haymakers or, does that writer know what a small arm is? I&#39;m assuming they assume a small arm is stuff like actually small weapons like pistols not, you know...a bolter, any form of plasma rifle, every kind of necron weapon or just a Glock 19 with a daemon of Khorne inside of it so it has an insane stopping power.</p> <p>IDK, it feels like the only weapons in 40k that actually suck are autoguns and lasguns but even then, there are many expectations because both of those families of weapons can produce small arms that&#39;ll slap someone&#39;s nuts clean off at 900m.</p> <p>So am I missing something here?<
