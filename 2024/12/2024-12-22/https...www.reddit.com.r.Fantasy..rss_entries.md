So, who came up with this trope? Was it Anne McCaffrey with Dragonflight (1968) or am I missing a book? Where do you think she got the idea? They make me feel like when I read Jack London’s White Fang (1906) as a kid and imagined having my own loyal hybrid wolf.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Alright I’m trying to come up with my TBR for 2025 and I wanted some book recommendations. I’m open to anything fantasy or sci fi. </p> <p>I’ve just finished reading everything by Brandon Sanderson, I’ve read A Song of Ice and Fire, I’ve read Red Rising, Ive read The Bloodsworn trilogy, I’ve read The Will of the Many, and I’m currently reading The Rage of Dragons. It’s come to my attention that a lot of the fantasy books I read tend to have either an “overthrow the evil government” or “I must seek revenge for my dead loved ones, and also be a little broody from time to time.” (I say this with nothing but love for these books and characters). </p> <p>I want something a bit different from that. Adventure is fine, it can be mature and have darker themes, or it can be light hearted and fun. But I want to know some good popular fantasy recommendations that I should read. I’m also a big fan of series, but not totally against standalone either. Let me know

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So pretty much every BookTuber I follow sings the highest of praises for this book. This combined with the Sword of Kaigen being one of my favourite books of all time made me go into this book with really high expectations. However, having just finished this book, I can&#39;t feel anything but disappointed? </p> <p>To me, the book just read like one big proselytism. As in, ML Wang was not subtle in the slightest with the message she wanted to convey. Although I agree with most of her opinions, I feel like it would have been good if she had tried to make at least some of the mages sympathetic. Instead, all of them were moustache twirling levels of evil. Due to her themes being so obvious from the start, the plot was extremely predictable. To the degree that, if you have read 10-20% of the book, you&#39;ll know exactly what&#39;s going to happen in the remainder.</p> <p>The book seems to be pretty much unanimously liked across Goodreads, Reddit and Boo
