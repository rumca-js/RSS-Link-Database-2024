I listened to an audio drama set after an apocalyptic event that worked out the majority of humans. It focused on a small group of people just trying to survive off the land again and getting along with each other. There was some drama involved and then meeting another group of people but it all focused on them preventing conflicts and instead helping others. I want to read more books like that.

Something that makes them mesmerizing, whether they&#39;re kind or cruel, rich or poor, gorgeous or average-looking. Think Gone Girl, Stargirl, Papertowns. The movie that sparked this question was Gone Girl. I watched it last night and Rosamund Pike&#39;s performance was...absolutely mesmerizing.

In the past, he was also really into a popular science-y book on human consciousness and another on the possible existence of God. (My dad is not a strongly religious person but he is somewhat interested in the philosophy of Christianity.) His interest in natural sciences and the universe is more on the philosophical/existential than the mathematical side, too. Any suggestions?

I also don&#39;t have examples of an actually healthy, liveable marriage around me. I just want a peek into what a couple could do together, enjoy as conversation, bond over etc. It doesn&#39;t have to be a book solely focused on this but I would like concrete examples of what life could look like, with marriage depicted in not just a trap which makes life boring and claustrophobic.
