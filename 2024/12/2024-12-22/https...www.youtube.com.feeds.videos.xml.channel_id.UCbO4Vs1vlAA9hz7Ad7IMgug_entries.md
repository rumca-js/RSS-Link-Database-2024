Welcome back to Inside Tabletop. In this series I talk to people that live and work in Gaming, getting them to share their insights on the business of game entertainment. 

Today I'm joined by Chris from Lords of War for another round of Retailer perspectives on the Tabletop Industry from a 20 Year veteran of both Games Workshop and Independent Sales. 

If you're a Patron you've already listened to all four upcoming episodes backstage and enjoyed the Q&As between topics; but this episode is also available as an exclusive audio Podcast today as well that you'll have already heard three days early!
