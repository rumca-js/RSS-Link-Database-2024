<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey Everyone, i need access to my wife&#39;s laptop. I don&#39;t want to change the password or do a whole bunch of fancy or complicated processes like cloning windows etc. as i generally won&#39;t have too much time with it or want her to know. I know she is on windows 11 and I&#39;m 90% sure her password is just 6 numbers. I dont know if knowing it just being numbers makes it easier or not. I also might be able to access it unlocked if she uses the bathroom or whatever but it would have to be fast. I don&#39;t know much about hacking or what tools are safe to use, or where to get the tools from. I am not asking anyone else to do it, just need to know how/what/where. Any help would be appreciated.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/VaultBoy1990"> /u/VaultBoy1990 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hackers/comments/1hk37ee/tips_for_getting_a_windows_11_login_password/">[link]</a></spa
