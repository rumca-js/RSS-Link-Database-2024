<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>When I built my first solo Django project, one of the biggest headaches I ran into‚Äîand the first thing that made me cry into my coffee‚Äîwas thinking I had set up the custom user model correctly, only to be hit with a bunch of errors. After some confusion, I realized that since I‚Äôd already made migrations, my only choices were to refactor my database or delete it and start over. It was extra terrible because I thought I was done with the project, but failing to set up the custom user model properly ended up costing me another four hours of work. It really made me panic and feel like my whole project was doomed. </p> <p>Recently I‚Äôve been thinking about what beginners might need to help them learn Django in the smoothest and fastest way possible, and felt that helping them avoid this mistake could be really helpful. So I made a <a href="https://youtu.be/OIC4ounpQjA?si=FqUsq-x8cuUsJM2n">YT video</a> where I basically beg people to set up a custom user an
