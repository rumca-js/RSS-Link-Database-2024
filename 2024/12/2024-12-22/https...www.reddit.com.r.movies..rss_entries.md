<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I watched this movie for the first time today. I was surprised by how good it looks. It&#39;s 14 years old and the lighting is still on point. The animations also leave nothing to be desired. The colours are wonderfully chosen. Only some minor daylight sequences can&#39;t hide a bit of well worn dust.</p> <p>What also surprised me about the movie was its ending. The main character wins a lot. But he is also losing a leg? I think that could cause some interesting dialogues with kids, right?</p> <p>Regarding the remake: even with the relatively decent trailer released some time ago, I have problems seeing that work out. The colours. The stilistic choices. The final battle. How are they gonna translate this into a realistic environment?</p> <p>We will see. What&#39;s left so far is watching the next two movies. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Phyliinx"> /u/Phyliinx </a> <br/> <span><a href="https:/

But I think this movie would&#39;ve been more brave, if it taught kids a more valuable lesson that you should always put your self-respect first and that a person who doesn&#39;t appreciate you enough, needs to live with the consequences of their mistake! </p> </div><!--

Love it or hate it, you have to admit it takes guts to go there.</p> <p>It’s one of those films that sticks with you, whether you want it to or not.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/sami002on"> /u/sami002on </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hk04ab/why_the_ending_of_the_mist_still_haunts_me/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hk04ab/why_the_ending_of_the_m

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>A little while back I watched the 2006 documentary ‘This Film Is Not Yet Rated’, which explored the classification conventions of American media and discussed the stigma surrounding the infamous NC-17 rating. Being Australian, I had no idea that this rating was viewed differently to our R18+, even though by all measures they are <em>meant</em> to be the exact same classification. I was even more shocked when I discovered that the producers of films will deliberately re-edit and occasionally even cut out scenes in order to lower their rating from a cinema-restricting NC-17 to a more audience-friendly R (our equivalent to an MA15).</p> <p>My question is, when these films are changed in order to lower their classification, does the rest of the world see this edited version too? Or do we see the version that initially wasn’t allowed in America? If we do in fact see the same version that America does, then I find it interesting that we most of the times w

Don’t really remember much of the movie, but I do remember there was a Russian bad guy that had an insane tattoo on his back that extended to his shoulder and neck that had a dot pattern where the dots got smaller the further down his back the tattoo went. If I remember correctly, he wore a kimono most of the time, and there was a scene in the movie where the camera pans away from his back and you can see his whole tattoo while he’s sitting in a dark room with a fire going. Also if I remember correctly it was an action movie with lots of fighting. Let me know if anything rings a bell!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/LuckyLuciano97"> /u/LuckyLuciano97 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hjn4d3/action_movie_with_russian_bad_guy_and_insane/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hjn4d3/acti
