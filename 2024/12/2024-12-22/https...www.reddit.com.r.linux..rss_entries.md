## Imagine if installing WhatsApp on your phone could conflict with a dependency of Photos, and make your phone unbootable. And this was considered normal.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m wondering what the differences are.<br/> I started using Linux with Mint (Cinnamon), and have been hopping around.<br/> I would prefer KDE - I tried MX (KDE) and Kubuntu. The tools in MX were a few years old. Kubuntu has the &quot;latest&quot; of most things. I was having some problems with KDE so decided to go back to Cinnamon.<br/> I&#39;m finding similar from Mint to Ubuntu Cinnamon - everything Ubuntu seems to have newer versions of packages, especially the kernel.<br/> For some reason I like to keep up with tools, but I&#39;ve read KDE Neon is way too unstable, so I didn&#39;t bother. I&#39;m also finding the Ubuntus on 24.10.1 are unstable (anything that involves lots of data transfer between disks or over network freezes the system)</p> <p>I&#39;d love to hear people&#39;s thoughts. I&#39;m not so much attached to a distro. I just prefer KDE and/or Cinnamon over others.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https:/

## Debian Stable actually have more recent packages than Ubuntu LTS thanks to backports

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I always thought Ubuntu offers the more recent packages. This makes sense because they release every half a year but I thought this also applies to Ubuntu LTS. I thought LTS also updates its packages so its not too much outdated. But now I see I was wrong.</p> <p>I see that the main repo for both Ubuntu LTS and Debian Stable keeps the same package versions it released with. It only does small updates for bugfixes or security fixes.</p> <p>And because those distros release in different years, this would basically mean that one year Debian Stable has newer packages and other year Ubuntu LTS has newer ones. So none is more recent all the time.</p> <p>But then I discovered backports. And what I see is that Debian is much more active with backports than Ubuntu. For example <a href="https://packages.debian.org/bookworm-backports/allpackages">Debian Bookworm</a> has cca 6200 backported packages. <a href="https://packages.ubuntu.com/jammy-backports/allpackag

Then, I&#39;ve assigned the bridge an IP in the vlan&#39;s subnet.</p> <p>Now, I&#39;m curious how this might look with <code>IFLA_BR_VLAN_FILTERING</code>. I think with this feature I can create just a single bridge, assign all physical trunk ports to the bridge, and then manage vlans similar to a more traditional switch.</p> <p>But what happens to IP addresses assigned to this type of bridge?

So I could probably solve this by deleting the nvidia_0 symlink, copying the intel_backlight one and renaming it to nvidia_0. </p> <p>But I dont have permissions, neither sudo, nor su- work and let me remove the file or change permissions. I think it would get reset with reboot too. How would I change this and
