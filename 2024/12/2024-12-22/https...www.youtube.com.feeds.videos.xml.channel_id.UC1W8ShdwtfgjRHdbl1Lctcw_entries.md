I colorized, restored and created a sound design for this video China, Beijing 1910, showcasing vibrant street scenes during the final Qing dynasty years. Highlights include hawkers, traders, artisans, and a barber styling a 'Manchu queue,' reflecting the city's rich street culture.

Video Restoration Process:
âœ” FPS boosted to 60 frames per second 
âœ” Image resolution boosted up to HD 
âœ” Improved video sharpness and brightness 
âœ” Colorized only for the ambiance (not historically accurate)
âœ”added sound only for the ambiance
âœ”restoration:(stabilisation,denoise,cleand,deblur) 
âœ”face restoration


Please, be aware that colorization colors are not real and fake, colorization was made only for the ambiance and do not represent real historical data.
