## Like some help deciding if the PSVR2 is a good choice for something to get as a party "gimmick" and using it with my gaming PC

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m desperately in need of planning out some activities for an upcoming family holiday party unless I want to spend four hours hearing the same questions about my life from 4 different people. Had some luck showing off the original PSVR back when it first came out but I sold it sometime after since the tech wasn&#39;t where I wanted it to be nor was I finding many games to play.</p> <p>I have a good 4K gaming PC now (AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D, 32GB Ram, Nvidia RTX 4080 Super, 2.5TB SSD, 850W PSU, AIO Cooling) and I noticed the PSVR2 being on sale. This would be for the holiday party to show off to some older and non-gaming people in general (it&#39;s also a nice excuse to check out how far VR has come). Like to get some input from people more in the know if this is worth spending the $400-$450 price since I would also need to buy a PC adapter from Sony.</p> <p><strong>To my questions about the PSVR2</strong>:</p> <ul> <li><p>Is the PSVR2 easy to set up

His speech is limited and he’s in a motorized wheelchair and has significantly decreased movement. I was thinking he might be interested in a VR headset to ‘travel’ and see different sights other than his living room. He doesn’t go to many places. </p> <p>I’d be splitting the cost with some of my cousins, but I have no idea where to start regarding the product. He likely wouldn’t use it for gaming (unless it was more simple?) but to stream some movies/shows and for some of the other relaxing features. </p> <p>Any insight would be greatly appreciated.

I guess the kills are more satisfying. That&#39;s definitely what it is.</p> <p>I never really get that &quot;I&#39;m a badass&quot; feeling from Pistol whip but this game you&#39;re basically a ninja dashing around the room killing everyone. It can be satisfying especially when you do it flawlessly.</p> <p>Only downside are the Superhot graphics. Which is fine but that&#39;s the only thing holding me back from giving it a strong recommend.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/TSLA_to_23_dollars"> /u/TSLA_to_23_dollars </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.co

If I’m in a small apartment no further than about 15-18 feet from my router and I get a good 6E router, do I really need two routers if I use 6E exclusively for WiFi and leave my other devices on 5?
