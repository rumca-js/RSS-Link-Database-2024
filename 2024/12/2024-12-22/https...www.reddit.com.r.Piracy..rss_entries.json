Both versions were Ultimate edition with pre-order DLC.

Using a Windows laptop before I leave, I want to download a lot of movie and tv shows so that I have stuff to watch while on the boat (without internet). What is the best way for me to download movies/shows on Windows and save to my hard drive?</p> <p>I have a paid Real Debrid subscription that I use with Stremio... I have heard of JDownloader and Debrid Media Manager, but I don&#39;t understand what either of those are for, or how to use them. Would I be able to download using Real Debrid, and if so, how do I do that?</p> <p>I&#39;ve been seeing Torbox mentioned a lot lately... if I subscribe to Torbox, is there any easy way to download shows on Windows using that?</p> <p>Or is there something else I should use to download movies?</p> <p>On the boat, I&#39;ll be watching on just a laptop screen, so I don&#39;t necessarily need 4k resolution for the",
