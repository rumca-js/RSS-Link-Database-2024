<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I ask this as a genuine question rather than to flame the so-called &quot;entry level&quot; jobs, but I really am truly curious. For those that didn&#39;t get the Network+ or CCNA or know very little about networks and work in a technical job involving SIEMs, threat hunting, networks, etc.</p> <p>I&#39;m on my 4th year as a security consultant for Splunk at a big4 and I&#39;ll be truthful that I don&#39;t really know networking that well. I&#39;m surprised I&#39;ve been able to bullshit my way this far, but I know up the ladder at a manager+ level it will get me in the end. I eventually want to pivot into Threat Intelligence, but I do realize that it&#39;s such a niche job that there aren&#39;t many job postings for. But I was planning to get my Network+ but had alot of people tell me it&#39;s too &quot;entry level&quot; for my stage in my career, which I found to be interesting.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.

With that, quality and compartmentalization began to rise, and I sold my company because I knew nothing could be offered as a solution.</p> <p>The company tanked a few months after being sold because the team was invaluable and not one easily replaced.</p> <p>Cybersecurity is more profitable than ever due to corruption and creating issues to profit from selling solutions. </p> <p>Compartmentalization leads to vulnerabilities
