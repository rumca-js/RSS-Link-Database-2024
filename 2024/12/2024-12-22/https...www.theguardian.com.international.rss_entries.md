<ul><li>Ukrainian wins 116-112 on all three scorecards</li><li>Briton shakes his head and leaves ring speechless</li></ul><p>Oleksandr Usyk remains the shining king of boxing’s dark and chaotic world. The great Ukrainian retained his three titles as the heavyweight champion of the world when he defeated Tyson Fury on points in a defining contest in the early hours of Sunday morning in Riyadh. Usyk boxed with clinical authority to win clearly by a score of 116-112 on all three&nbsp;cards.</p><p>The pace was unrelenting and, ultimately, Usyk was just too fast, too smart and too skilled for Fury. His movement, accuracy and precision of punching were simply too much for Fury, who tried valiantly and had his moments of success. But Fury flagged and he looked exhausted at key moments of the bout as Usyk pulled away to secure his ­comprehensive&nbsp;victory.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/dec/22/oleksandr-usyk-wins-heavyweight-rematch-tyson-fury-riyadh-boxing">Continue

<p>We all know what hurts, but why is it so difficult to describe? Emma Cook meets the neurologists attempting to solve one of medicine’s most enduring issues and what it means for patients – and hears from a woman who has never felt pain</p><p>Deep in the basement of Oxford’s <a href="https://ibme.ox.ac.uk/">Institute of Biomedical Engineering</a>, I am sitting in a pain laboratory trying to describe a series of small but exquisitely sharp electrical shocks emanating from an electrode attached to my index finger. It is proving to be something of a challenge. “Yeah, no, that’s really, er, unpleasant,” I offer, inarticulately, as the electric shocks slowly ramp up, their intensity putting me in mind of an excruciating jellyfish sting last summer.</p><p>“Ow, that really hurts,” I manage. Up goes the volume. “And this?” Language escapes me and I emit a small reflexive cry instead. <a href="https://www.ndcn.ox.ac.uk/team/ben-seymour">Dr Ben Seymour</a>, a professor of clinical neuroscien
