The cards were different ancient military unit types, like spear, cavalry, I think catapult, archer, stuff like that. And you played them in a line in front of you and the way the card rules worked it naturally made sense to usually have cavalry on the flanks, archers behind and infantry in front. But that wasn&#39;t a rule, it was just what made sense.</p> <p>Unfortunately that&#39;s as much as I remember! But to my recollection it was pretty no frills and straightforward, just here&#39;s the units, you play them in two lines in front of you, you have a battle, you play more units, and so on, til someone wins. But I don&#39;t remember what the win condition was, nor whether the cards had anything like a number on them denoting power other than just what kind of unit it was.</p> <p>Well, is there any specific game that jumps out as the one this might have been?</p> </div><!-- ",

An example is Ticket to Ride Legacy (no picture incl. to avoid spoilers).

For example, if the decree is roses and the lead plays a 9 of roses, the second player plays a 3/fox of stars and chooses themself and swaps the rose decree for a star card, how does that affect the winner of the round?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.",

It consists of them flipping somewhat thin rectangular pieces onto a board that\u2019s on top of the game box (I think). The goal is to flip all the pieces onto the board, where they stack up, making it increasingly difficult to balance them. If the pile or tower tips over, the player that did it must take all the pieces that fall off.

Let me apologize in advance for the very vague details I am able to provide. So what I am looking for is a horror game about people exploring a mansion, at some point one, othe the players will find an evil mask that turns them into a killer, the game board has 3D parts and the characters are physical miniatures. I sawthis game on a pre-order site and can&#39;t for the life of me remember where or what the name was. I believe there were two expansion packs that added a different mini for the killer one for a girl one for a boy that added some new cards to the game as well. Again sorry for the lack of information but I am really hoping someone can help me find this thing.
