        "description": "Grand Antique marble, from the Pyrenees Mountains, is renowned for its naturally occurring stark black-and-white contrast. It's been in demand among the elite as early as antiquity. The Romans quarried it for centuries, and it's featured in St. Mark\u2019s Basilica in Venice, as well as Joseph Napoleon's tomb. But mining this marble ground to a halt nearly 70 years ago, until a quarryman rediscovered it. Now, a square meter of Grand Antique costs nearly $2,000.\n\n00:00 - Introduction\n01:27 - Rediscovering the Quarry\n04:22 - Extracting Grand Antique\n05:27 - Flooding the Market\n06:46 - Grand Antique Clients\n12:01 - Trying to Extract Again\n13:12 - The Future Market\n13:55 - Credits\n------------------------------------------------------\n#marble #expensive #businessinsider \n\nBusiness Insider tells you all you need to know about business, finance, tech, retail, and more.\n\nVisit our homepage for the top stories of the day: https://www.businessinsider.com\nBusiness Insider on Facebook: https://www.f",
