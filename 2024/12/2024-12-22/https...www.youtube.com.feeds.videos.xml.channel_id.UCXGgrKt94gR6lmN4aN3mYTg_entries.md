In this video, I head to Micro Center to build a reasonable gaming PC for around $1,000, aiming for great 1080p and 1440p performance. I focus on value and finding the best deals, ultimately choosing a Micro Center-exclusive Ryzen 5 7600X3D CPU and an Intel ARC B580 GPU for a powerful yet affordable rig. This build is one that gamers can actually put together and get great performance.
