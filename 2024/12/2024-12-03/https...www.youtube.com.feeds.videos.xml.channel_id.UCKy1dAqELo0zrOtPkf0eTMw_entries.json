This show will actually have to pay off its foreshadowed mysteries in a satisfying way if it hopes to leave us with something half as memorable as its inspiration, but the fact that there seems to be a story justification for the \u201880s nostalgia bait aesthetics it slathers on is a good sign for things to come.",
