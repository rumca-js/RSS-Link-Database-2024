When the first fixture between Farul Constanta and Toulouse kicked off on the shores of the Black Sea with minimal fanfare in October 1995 few would have predicted the enduring impact it would have on rugby\u2019s consciousness.</p><p>But does its same old visceral thrill still endure? The pressure is now on the modern keepers of the flame, with the competition experiencing something of a mid-life crisis. Declining television rights deals, rising costs, tweaked formats and the age-old challenge of trying to squeeze a quart into a pint pot in terms of the global fixture list have all diluted the warm, fuzzy glow that once suffused the entire event.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/dec/03/rugby-union-champion",

Originally called the Creators, they soon turned into Nightshift, due to members doing evening work in a steel yard.

The band became War.</p><p>\u201cIt was during Vietnam,\u201d says keyboardist-vocalist Lonnie Jordan, now 75 years old. \u201cA lot of the soldiers came<em> </em>home to a war in their own back yards.
