<p>A peculiar trend has taken hold within the AI gold rush: Major players in the space—from OpenAI to Google and Microsoft—have started to heavily market their AI models as “open.” These companies are using terms like “open AI” to align with notions of transparency, collaboration, and shared progress associated with <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3429076/what-is-open-source-software-open-source-and-foss-explained.html">open source software</a>. However, a closer look reveals that this embrace of “openness” is largely performative—a concept now termed “open-washing.”</p>

<p>The volume of data being created today is truly staggering. IDC projects that global data will reach 400 zettabytes (400 billion terabytes) by 2028, with 90% of that data classified as unstructured data. The proliferation of <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3220044/what-is-big-data-analytics-fast-answers-from-diverse-data-sets.html">so much data</a>, and so much unstructured data, raises two primary questions: How do we manage it all, and how can we use it to power the next generation of AI applications?</p>
