If we rewind five years and someone were to write a political thriller where the Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission was placed under house arrest, three consecutive Defense Ministers were arrested, and two of the four commission members were secretly detained with black hoods over their heads while the whereabouts of the third remains unknown and suspected of being in trouble—such a person would undoubtedly be questioned for having a few screws loose for fabricating such an absurd and illogical storyline.

A few days ago, a Financial Times exclusive story instantly swept across the media world: China's newly appointed Defense Minister, Dǒng Jūn (董军), who has been in office for just seven months, is under investigation.
