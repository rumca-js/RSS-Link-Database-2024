<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I saw that there are some companies that are offering ecommerce product data enrichment services. Basically you provide image and product data and get any missing data and even gtins. Any clue where the companies find gtin data? I am building a social commerce platform that needs a huge database of deduplicated product ideally gtin/upc level. Would be awesome if someone could give some hints :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/infinitypisquared"> /u/infinitypisquared </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1h5wykq/product_gtinupc/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1h5wykq/product_gtinupc/">[comments]</a></span>
