<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I bought some files (PDFs) from a website that failed to inform me that they were going to only be available on FileOpen&#39;s web viewer and that they were not available for download.</p> <p>Well, I paid for these things, I would like to be able to view them offline and on any of my devices. I found some info in older threads here for removing FileOpen DRM, but I can&#39;t even download the files. I&#39;ve tried using JDownloader and WFDownloader and they can&#39;t access the PDFs. I tried installing the FileOpen plugin for a popular PDF viewer and it doesn&#39;t seem to let you open files from their site, just validate local files. Any ideas?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Steady_Ri0t"> /u/Steady_Ri0t </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1h5bpfy/download_file_from_fileopen/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1h5bpfy/do

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all, </p> <p>I know this is a common question but I&#39;m a baby pirate and don&#39;t really understand what other related threads are instructing users to do, so I&#39;d appreciate any help you&#39;re willing to offer. All I want is to download a show to use in video editing, so 1080p is sufficient. </p> <p>StreamFab was the most suggested method in other threads, so I tried using a pirated version, but it kept asking me to buy the Netflix downloader package in order to do so (maybe I just don&#39;t know how to use it). The second most suggested method was to check the Megathread (obviously), but I didn&#39;t know which links were simply to watch, vs to actually download.</p> <p>Thanks in advance :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/jizzykawamarlo"> /u/jizzykawamarlo </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1h5a7l6/how_to_download_a_tv_show_from_netflix/">[link]</a></s
