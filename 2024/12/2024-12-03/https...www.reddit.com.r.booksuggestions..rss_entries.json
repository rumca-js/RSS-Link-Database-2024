Throughout his life he was a very religious jewish man and I, as his daughter, could never really fulfill his wishes on being religious in the way he was. He loved me dearly but was very stubborn. To paint a picture, everyone in my family\u2019s last conversations with him, when he was coherent, was an argument of some sort. I\u2019ve been listening to old voicemails where he\u2019s been begging me to call him back and I can\u2019t now. I know this is a lot of information, but our relationship was very complex and I feel like a lot of the books I\u2019m finding when I search are not reflective in the slightest of all the emotions im dealing with. I prefer fiction or memoir led books. Not interested in self help. </p> <p>Thank you and please call back your loved ones.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Round_Va",

But lately, I\u2019ve been feeling frustrated with some of the hyped BookTok recommendations. Many of them seem to focus solely on romance and spice, with characters that lack depth. It\u2019s even worse when the characters don\u2019t seem to have a life outside of the romance!</p> <p>And don\u2019t get me wrong\u2014I don\u2019t mind spice! It\u2019s really nice in some books. But I\u2019d love to find stories where the romance is just one part of a richer, more layered narrative.</p> <p>That\u2019s why I\u2019m reaching out to see if anyone has recommendations for romance books that offer something more. I\u2019m looking for stories where I can truly escape, with well-rounded characters and immersive storytelling. One hyped author I really enjoy is Emily Henry. I find her books beautifully written and layered, offering much more than just a love story. I\u2019m also open to romance novels with elements of fantasy or magical realism.</p> <p>T",

She\u2019s really into Sylvia Plath, she\u2019s already read The Journals of Sylvia Plath and most of her works (I\u2019m not sure which ones she hasn\u2019t read yet, though). She\u2019s also loved The Song of Achilles and Things We Say in the Dark. I remember her mentioning that she wants to read Normal People by Sally Rooney because she enjoyed the series, but I\u2019ve seen mixed reviews about the book (some say the series is better). So now I\u2019m second-guessing if it\u2019s the right choice. If anyone has ideas for books she might like, especially something similar in tone, style, or themes to what I\u2019ve mentioned, I\u2019d be super grateful.

I thought about giftig him one for christmas. </p> <p>Here&#39;s where I need help. He plays in a band and music is a big passion for him. So maybe a biography of a musician would be cool.

Another important aspect for me is character driven plot, where the characters have a complex relationship. Like for example, Jayce and Viktor share the same dreams, but they don&#39;t always agree and they do sometimes fall apart. Id love to read about characters that are devoted to their craft, their opinions for their creation differs AND their relationship is essential to the story too. It doesn&#39;t have to be any kind of romantic relationship.</p> <p>Maybe that&#39;s too specific, but I&#39;m shooting my shot. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/myeyeswentdark\"> /u/myeyeswentdark </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1h5hkoj/stories_with_academicinventor_main_characters_and/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; ",

With the COVID lockdowns and my growing reliance on technology, my attention span seems to be getting shorter and shorter. This is something I desperately want to fix, because I love reading and I believe it makes me a more articulate speaker and a more competent writer. As a kid I was an avid reader and a fast one; I loved the popular fantasy series&#39; like Keeper of the Lost Cities, Percy Jackson, Wings of Fire, The Mysterious Benedict Society, etc. I&#39;d read like I was hungry for it (when I was 10, I once read a 600 page book before noon - these days I&#39;m rarely awake before noon), but I noticed a change around 2020. Now that I&#39;m a freshman in high school and have recently been diagnosed with ADHD, I&#39;m basically your classic case of &#39;gifted kid syndrome&#39;.

Currently reading Christian books from John Mark Comer and Francis Chan but these are easy for me. I love reading these. I want to get into fiction and enjoying reading outside of christian books.<br/> I love shows like bloodline and tracker, Lost etc. So I&#39;m guessing I enjoy thriller, suspense, mystery, psychological thrillers, and even crime I think. Also open to non fiction recommendations including psychology and counselling.
