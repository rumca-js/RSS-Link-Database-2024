<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’ve been eyeing <em>Terraforming Mars</em> and the <em>Prelude</em> expansion for a while now, and I’m really tempted to take the bait and buy it. But before I commit, I’ve got a couple of questions for the community since it seems to be an extremely popular game with lots of detractors and lovers. </p> <p>First off—<em>is it as fun as people say?</em> I’ve read a lot about the strategic depth, cool combos, and how satisfying it is to transform the planet over the course of the game. But I’m not sure if it’s worth diving into if you’re not totally obsessed with heavy Euro-style games.</p> <p>Second—<em>is it really that long?</em> I’ve seen so many comments about 3+ hour playtimes, even with experienced players. Does the <em>Prelude</em> expansion actually help with that? I hear it speeds up the early game, but does it make a big enough difference?</p> <p>Would love to hear your thoughts! Is this game as amazing as people say, or does it overstay it

It wasn’t the triumphant, golden light of spring; it was the hesitant first light of something on the cusp of being. The houses—old brick and sagging wood—seemed more exhausted than usual, their weary facades muted and weary beneath the sky&#39;s indifferent gaze. This was a place where secrets ought not to take root, where nothing grand was meant to occur. But life, as it often does, had its own ideas.</p> <p>Within the Normal family home, the hearth crackled a weak, defiant warmth, the kind that has grown accustomed to the cold. The fire, like the house itself, was enduring, not thriving. The rooms—simple, lived-in—felt like the corners of someone’s forgotten story, full of details that were once fresh but now have the quiet weight of history. The house had seen it all—joys and

Possible?

## Is Wyrmspan a game about rising dragons?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I saw Wyrmspan yesterday at a store, and I fell in love. I&#39;m a huge dragon nerd, and after seeing that it’s a new version of a pretty famous and great game, I almost bought it.</p> <p>But before spending money, I want to ask a few questions, primarily about the nature of the game. I like the concept of collecting eggs to raise dragons that create effects or score points. (I mean, it seems like a chill board game—I’m not expecting epic dragon battles.) However, I’m not sure if this concept translates well into the gameplay or if the dragons are just a superficial theme. Also, I’d like to know if you consider this game fun with 3 or 4 players. I’ve seen some posts about Wingspan, the original game, suggesting that it can be long and boring. (Maybe it’s just a small minority opinion, since the game has a great score on BGG.)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/icaromhb"> /u/icaromhb </a> <br/> <span
