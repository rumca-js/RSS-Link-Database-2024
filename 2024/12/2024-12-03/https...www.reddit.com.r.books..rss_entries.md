<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Read about a book from the 30’s that I had never heard of called “Cain’s Jawbone”. It is 100 or so pages, but printed out of order. You are supposed to tear out the pages, try to logic them in order, and solve six murders. Supposedly only a handful of people over the years have solved it correctly. </p> <p>This made me remember a book I read when I was a kid. It was a large book, size-wise, almost like a coffee table book. You read the mystery, with various clues, and the solution was sealed in an envelope at the back of the book. Can’t remember the name at all. Anyone recognize it? Would love to find it again. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/CalifScots"> /u/CalifScots </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h61012/unusual_mystery_books/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h61012/unusual_mystery_books/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I admit I&#39;m very impulsive when it comes to books- when I see interesting series I buy everything or at least add it to my neverending TBR list.</p> <p>The result is two bookcases of books and countless titles shipped to local hospital unopened because I felt overhelmed by the mess. I got complete paralysis when it comes to deciding what to read so often I just give up. I borrow piles of books that I have to return to library because I can&#39;t extend it endlessly. </p> <p>In new year I want to be more deliberate and actually curate my reading to get something reminding a steady reading streak. </p> <p>Any tips?
