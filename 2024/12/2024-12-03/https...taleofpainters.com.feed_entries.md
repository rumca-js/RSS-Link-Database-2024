<p>I had the opportunity to work with Garfy on the recent Necromunda: Hive Secundus release. Necromunda is one of my favourite games. Sadly, I have not had much opportunity to play the latest edition, this is something that I am hoping to rectify next year. However, I always follow the releases with great interest and have often purchased some of the gangs and models just because I love the characterful sculpts so much. I find they are perfect for using in narrative games of 40k as well. </p>
