<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi guys, thanks for reading my post.<br/> I&#39;m currently making an Ecommerce website on Django that sells electronic devices for my university project. I chose Django as the primary framework since my teacher heavily emphasizes the interaction with databases.<br/> Some clarification before I get to my question is that there are multiple instances of the same product stored within the database with all different IDs. For example, <strong>If there are 5 &quot;Laptop A&quot;s, then all 5 of them must have different IDs</strong>. So I&#39;ve been having a lot of difficulty with the process of adding the products into the cart. Additionally, all products have attribute &quot;Status&quot; that indicates whether it&#39;s a new or secondhand product.<br/> Suppose for my cart I currently have 10 instances of Laptop A.</p> <p>7 of them are New and 3 of them are Secondhand.</p> <pre><code>class Product(models.Model): id = models.IntegerField(db_column=&#39;I

I&#39;m planning to start a little home business selling products online and I need a website for it. I know a lot of people use sites like Square or Shoppify to setup an online shop but there are a few reasons I&#39;m contemplating making my own website in Django. I have a marketing/analytics background and would love my hands to be completely open to do all sorts of live experimentations, data collection, AI-powered customizations on the website. For example, when a user steps on the website and logs in, I need to spontaneously customize the pages based on the data I have on them and their previous visits/purchases etc. This obviously requires the website to be dynamic and connected to some databases. As another example, when a customer leaves an order, I need the website to be connected to my other Python program
