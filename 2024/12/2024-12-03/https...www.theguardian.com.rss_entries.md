<p>A jeweller and a homeopath set up a murder-suicide sect, and this chilling series meets the relatives of the deceased plus the crack team of journalists who worked the case. But why the pumping electro soundtrack?</p><p>Unless you’re particularly interested in cults – and French cults at that – there’s a strong possibility that you’ve yet to come across the Order of the Solar Temple. For the uninitiated, the OTS was a religious cult active from the mid-1980s to the mid-90s, basing its teachings on a grab bag that included new age fluff, Freemasonry and ideas pilfered from the Knights Templar. Its founders – jeweller turned spiritual guru Joseph Di Mambro and a charismatic homeopath named Luc Jouret – succeeded in recruiting several hundred members across Switzerland, France, Canada and even a handful on the French Caribbean island of Martinique.</p><p>In its promo videos, the OTS steered away from bells and smells to promote its ecological credentials, with members living off the

<p><strong>National Gallery, London</strong><br>The loins of the dreaming hermit Jerome are thrust into our eyeline in a quirky painting that gets more subversive the longer you look at it</p><p>It’s a cosy tradition at the National Gallery to showcase one of its Christmassy paintings at this time of year – a Nativity, or an Adoration of the Magi perhaps. This year’s religious masterpiece is different. Parmigianino’s tall (3.5m) yet narrow painting <a href="https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/exhibitions/parmigianino-the-vision-of-saint-jerome">The Vision of St Jerome is wild</a>, quirky and gets more subversive the longer you look at it. For one thing, there is a female nude hidden in this devotional scene. Parmigianino has changed the gender and aged her – but once you see it there’s no mistaking his quotation of one of the most sensual paintings in the European canon.</p><p>The Vision of St Jerome gets its title from the sleeping figure of the hermit Jerome lying under a rocky over

<p>The prime minister won’t learn charisma, but he has a record of going places by doggedly clearing the obstacles in his way</p><p>If Rishi Sunak had clung to power until the very end of the five-year term that Boris Johnson won in 2019, he would still be prime minister today. He had until 28 January next year to hold the election. The equivalent deadline for Keir Starmer is 21 August 2029. That is a horizon beyond the reach of reliable political forecasting, even if the second half of this decade turns out less volatile than the first. More turbulence seems likelier.</p><p>But Labour’s majority is much bigger than the one Sunak lost and Starmer’s character contains none of the traits that made Johnson such a wellspring of chaos. With just 121 Tory MPs, Kemi Badenoch will struggle to have much impact in parliament.

I was washing my body every day, so I figured I should shampoo my hair daily too.

Shampoo as little as possible, she advised. She herself only did it once a week.</p><p>I tried this for a couple of horrible months. All it accomplished was to make me look like something pulled out of a grease trap.

<p>As new national poet, the Gaelic speaker is looking at all of the languages spoken in the country, to see ‘what we can learn between them’</p><p>Peter Mackay seems to write poetry as he speaks. An island, he ponders, “can be seen as bounded by the sea or as infinitely connected”. He is interested in the parallels between Federico García Lorca’s Andalucía and “the wet deserts of the outer Hebrides”. Poetry, he believes, “can create whole worlds and make them matter”.</p><p>It is appropriate, then, that 45-year-old Mackay was announced yesterday as Scotland’s new makar, or national poet. He is the youngest makar to date, and the first one who writes primarily in Gaelic. He is “flabbergasted and delighted” by the honour, but also “slightly bemused,” he says.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/dec/03/scotland-has-always-been-multilingual-new-scottish-makar-peter-mackay">Continue reading...</a>

Then, on 7 October of last year, Hamas entered Israel, killing and kidnapping about 1,400 people.

Pivoting to rent-a-quote somehow does not feel like the solution that a malfunctioning UK requires.</p><p>Perhaps Starmer thought it would make him more popular?

Picture books are good like that.</p><p>A Leaf Called Greaf is about a lonely bear who finds a “beguiling” green leaf, and with it, comfort and companionship. Greaf (short for “green leaf”) changes with the seasons and eventually crumbles to pieces; gone but still surrounding Bear. It’s a gentle story with emotive windswept-looking illustrations that hint at the family Bear once had. My friend said the book touched her heart and that, for

<p>Competition must regain thrill of the past as it copes with declining TV deals, rising costs and tweaked formats </p><p>Let’s hear it for the 30th edition of the old Heineken Cup, the cross-border club tournament now known officially as the Investec Champions Cup. When the first fixture between Farul Constanta and Toulouse kicked off on the shores of the Black Sea with minimal fanfare in October 1995 few would have predicted the enduring impact it would have on rugby’s consciousness.</p><p>But does its same old visceral thrill still endure? The pressure is now on the modern keepers of the flame, with the competition experiencing something of a mid-life crisis. Declining television rights deals, rising costs, tweaked formats and the age-old challenge of trying to squeeze a quart into a pint pot in terms of the global fixture list have all diluted the warm, fuzzy glow that once suffused the entire event.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/dec/03/rugby-union-champion

<p>The standup on the power of strange shirts, the importance of never Googling yourself and how he came to specialise in one-liners</p><p><strong>How did you get into comedy?<br></strong>I tried to be an actor, but nobody else wanted me to be one. Then I tried standup so “theatre people” could come and see me. Slowly I began to evolve a character that did one-liners, mainly because I was so terrified that I had to get to the bit where people laughed as quickly as possible. It only really took off when I stuck my hair up and started wearing strange shirts and jumpers. (This was supposed to be a signpost that I was coming from leftfield.) This all helped create a world I could begin to write for.</p><p><strong>Who did you admire when you were starting out?<br></strong>I was mostly inspired by comic actors like Rowan Atkinson, Leonard Rossiter and Ronnie Barker. It wasn’t until TV shows like Saturday Live came along and I saw people like Harry Enfield and Rik Mayall that I became inspi

By then, Sony had already announced its intention to develop the PlayStation console – the previous October – but it was the cover feature in the world’s most forward-looking game publication that really blew open the possibilities of the machine. As well as listing its specifications in full, Edge secured enthusiastic statements of support from Capcom, Namco and Konami. One breathless developer told the mag: “It’s going to revolutionise the way computers are at the moment.” Suddenly, the whole structure of the console games business was being threatened. All it needed was a push.</p><p>Sony’s entry into the video game industry has become the stuff of legend (

The band became War.</p><p>“It was during Vietnam,” says keyboardist-vocalist Lonnie Jordan, now 75 years old. “A lot of the soldiers came<em> </em>home to a war in their own back yards. So we started waging war <em>against </em>wars everywhere, with our choice of weapons being our instruments. We don’t shoot bullets; we shoot rhythms. War was for peace.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/dec/03/

<p>Cruises, fishing boats and even whale-watchers are adding to the din underwater, which biologist Heike Vester says not only masks cetaceans’ communication but can also stop them feeding    </p><p>From the moment that the biologist Dr Heike Vester presses play, the sound of the static of the fjord fills the room. First comes the constant, steady rumbling of a boat engine. Then, every eight seconds, like a foreboding bass drum, comes the explosion of seismic airguns – extremely loud blasts used in oil and gas exploration that can travel vast distances underwater.</p><p>And finally, dancing above it all – and at times drowned out by it – are the soaring vocalisations of whales.</p><p>Heike Vester at home in Bodø, Norway. Her love of whales comes partly from her interest in matrilineal societies.

<p>Guardian findings back up research by rights group which reveals ‘shocking behavioural norms’ of Israeli soldiers</p><p>Israeli soldiers based in the occupied West Bank city of Hebron have intensified a campaign of arbitrary detentions, beatings and abuse of Palestinians, according to Guardian interviews with affected residents and new research by the rights group B’Tselem.</p><p>Three people described being seized on the street while going about their daily business on flimsy pretexts such as photos of Palestinian flags found on their phones or allegations of stone-throwing. They were handcuffed, blindfolded and taken to nearby military posts, where they were subjected to mental and physical abuse for hours. One 60-year-old man, Bader a-Tamimi, said he was hit in the torso and thrown against the wall after asking soldiers to stop destroying the wares in his souvenir shop.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/03/israeli-soldiers-conducting-campaign-of-beatings-a

<p>The musician is back with a live album and as passionate as ever. She discusses fans, failure, muses, misogyny – and why she won’t tolerate bad behaviour</p><p>By the third UK lockdown, Tori Amos was wondering if she would ever play live again. At her remote house in Cornwall, where we meet, she began mourning the loss of connection with her audience. When the US singer and songwriter is on tour, giving her famously passionate performances, hundreds of letters pour in every day, requesting songs. “I try to read as many as I can, and we change the show every night, except the bookends. Anything else is up for grabs.”</p><p>Her relationship with her fans has always been collaborative. They tell her things. They trust her. In person, she has an open-book quality that immediately draws you in. When I arrive at her place – a detached but unassuming house upfront, and a warren of more recently built workshops at the back, filled with beautiful pianos, a massive mixing desk and the harps

<p>Canonisation has long been a way for the Catholic church to shape its image. The Vatican is preparing to anoint its first millennial saint, but how does it decide who is worthy?</p><p>As a child growing up in Milan, Carlo Acutis collected stories of miracles. He wrote about the time when, in 1411, wine turned to blood in a castle chapel in Ludbreg, Croatia; of how, in 1630, a pastor in Canosio, Italy, saved his town from a flood by blessing the raging waters; of how, in 1906, a priest on the island of Tumaco, Colombia, held up a reliquary on the beach to stop an approaching tsunami. Acutis, 11 years old and a devout Catholic, began typing up these stories and posting them on his website, which he styled as a “<a href="http://www.miracolieucaristici.org/galleria/en/galleria.html">virtual museum</a>” of miraculous events. A section on the site invited visitors to “discover how many friends you have in heaven”, and to read stories of young saints.</p><p>Acutis hoped to one day join t

<p>Hunter Biden was awaiting sentencing for gun and tax offences when, suddenly, his father pardoned him. Has family loyalty been put above presidential integrity? <strong>Chris Michael</strong> explains</p><p>Joe Biden’s love for his family has long softened his public persona. From his grief at losing his first wife and daughter in a car crash, to the death of his son Beau, the tragedy he endured has been clear. And so has his obvious devotion to his second wife, Jill, and his remaining son, Hunter.</p><p>It was in this light – as a doting father keen to protect his son – that the president hopes people will see his sudden decision to grant a pardon to Hunter for gun and federal tax offences. He was due to be sentenced this month. Hunter had become the first child of a sitting president to face a criminal trial and could have spent years in prison.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2024/dec/03/why-joe-biden-pardoned-his-son-podcast">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Nato foreign ministers to hold likely last meeting before Trump returns to presidency; talk of peace negotiations rumbles on. What we know on day 1,014</p><p><strong>Nato is highly unlikely to heed Ukraine’s call for a membership invitation at a meeting on Tuesday, diplomats have told the Reuters news agency.</strong> “It will take weeks and months to get consensus,” a senior Nato diplomat said on Monday, Reuters reported. “I don’t see that happening tomorrow, I would be very surprised.” The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, will be in Brussels on Tuesday and Wednesday for the probably last high-level Nato foreign ministers’ meeting before Donald Trump takes over from Joe Biden as president.</p><p><strong>In a letter to his Nato counterparts ahead of the meeting, the Ukrainian foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha, said an invitation would remove one of Russia’s main arguments for waging its war – namely, preventing Ukraine from joining the alliance.</strong> Ukraine’s president, V
