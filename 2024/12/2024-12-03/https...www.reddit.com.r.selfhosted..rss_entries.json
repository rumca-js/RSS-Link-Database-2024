I have created a tool to deploy your application to Bare Metal / VPS via Docker.</p> <p>Deploying an application through Docker is not always easy. You have to configure all parameters, build the application by hand and push to registry, update services yourself and rollback. Leverans is just a convenient wrapper over Docker.</p> <p>The config file is inherited from Docker Compose, so it&#39;s easy to understand.</p> <p>It works through CLI, has almost no overhead, so they can work even on the weakest servers.</p> <p>Automatically manages reverse proxy and SSL.</p> <p>Installation is 2 commands, one in the server the other in the local computer.</p> <p>I think you will like it. If you like the idea, the only thing I ask is a star on Github.

You have 100+ users, many services in different languages, and several environments. And hardcoded access control rules tangled with business logic make every new role and permission change a hassle to write, test, and maintain.</p> <p>So, in order for the access rules to stay consistent across the entire code base &amp; avoid security vulnerabilities - we built Cerbos PDP.

OS and Immich are local, b1 and b2 are on a separate OMV machine as samba/cifs. I cant get the drives to reliably show, usually they all show the same as OS. See below for compose and widgets files... Drives are fstab mounted in the home folder, except for OS of course. I tried swapping round the order of the volumes in the compose file (I think, or maybe the widgets.yaml file, cant remember) which actually worked until I rebooted now Im back here. If it was a CIFS issue it wouldnt be happening with the local Immich drive. Am a bit stuck. Thanks.</p> <p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ou4ox2atbk4e",
