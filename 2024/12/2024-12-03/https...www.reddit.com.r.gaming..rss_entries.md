## Path of Exile 2, and a recent trend in gaming

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>It seems like Path of Exile 2 is shaping up to follow in the footsteps of Elden Ring and Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, a game in a more niche genre, that doubles down on the things people love about that genre, and finds mainstream success by virtue of it being really, really good. Even Metaphor: Re Fantazio sort of fits into that catagory, although I think it&#39;s a littke more refined than Persona. And it&#39;s got me thinking about how some of the bigger failures of the past few years were games that tried for the broadest appeal possible, and ended up being super bland and forgettable in doing so. Games like Suicide Squad and Star Wars Outlaws. There&#39;s nothing really wrong with those games, there&#39;s just nothing that makes them stand out.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/thewalkindude"> /u/thewalkindude </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h5vyez/path_of_exile_2_a

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>To me the PS2 era games hit hard, especially FFX and Kingdom Hearts, I loved how much there was to play in FFX, I was totally hooked as a kid. Playing it today I realize most of it was grinding the same enemies for tens of hours, so not my top RPG.</p> <p>The original FFVII is probably my favorite, it has such memorable story, music and the materia system was fun. The remakes have been pretty good also!</p> <p>Honorable mention to Skyrim, it&#39;s weird how at the same time it is such a mess and a masterpiece; spent +1000 hours playing/making mods for it.</p> <p>So what are your favorites and why?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Routasoft"> /u/Routasoft </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h5jpzn/what_are_your_favorite_rpgs_of_all_time/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h5jpzn/what_are_your_favorite_rpgs_of_all_time/">

## Dragon Age: Inquisition first demo from behind closed doors. Very different to the final product! I would love to see a Dragon Age title more like this.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Do you guys have fun playing older games? I mean games from the 6th generation backwards, games released 20, 30 or even 40 years ago. I want to know if the outdated mechanics and gameplay of some old games can still attract younger people too play them or they&#39;re enjoyable only for us who grew up with them.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Domeriko648"> /u/Domeriko648 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h5bsen/a_question_to_younger_gamers25yo_or_younger/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h5bsen/a_question_to_younger_gamers25yo_or_younger/">[comments]</a></span>
