Star Wars: Skeleton Crew episodes 1 & 2 reviewed by Sam Barsanti on Disney+. Premieres December 2, 2024.
The way it stands now, after these first two episodes, there’s a lot of good momentum carrying Star Wars: Skeleton Crew forward after it’s set up its “Goonies in Space” cast of kids who escape the suburban doldrums and find themselves hurtling toward adventure and conflict with cartoonish space pirates. This show will actually have to pay off its foreshadowed mysteries in a satisfying way if it hopes to leave us with something half as memorable as its inspiration, but the fact that there seems to be a story justification for the ‘80s nostalgia bait aesthetics it slathers on is a good sign for things to come.
