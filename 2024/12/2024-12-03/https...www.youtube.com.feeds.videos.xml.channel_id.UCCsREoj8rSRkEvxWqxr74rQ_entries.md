🎙️ In this episode of the CyberNews Weekly Podcast, the hosts explore two major topics: the latest tactics used by Russian state-affiliated hackers to breach Western organizations via neighboring Wi-Fi networks, and the rise of 'Yami Baito' schemes in Japan, where young people are drawn into cyber and physical crimes through deceptive online advertisements. The discussion also delves into the concept of 'enshittification,' describing how digital platforms degrade the user experience as they prioritize investors over users. The episode examines cybersecurity strategies, the psychology driving youth involvement in crime, and the importance of fostering stronger protective measures and economic opportunities.
