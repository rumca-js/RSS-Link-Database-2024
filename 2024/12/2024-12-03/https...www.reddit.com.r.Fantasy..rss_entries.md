<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I&#39;ve been seeing Joe Abercrombie&#39;s name a lot for a while and he always seems to be highly praised and I figured it was time to give it a go. I don&#39;t like to have plots spoiled so I avoided much discussion of his books but I got The First Law trilogy as a gift and have been working through the first book, The Blade Itself.</p> <p>Well, it surely lives up to the hype, and I&#39;m over here having a jolly good time with all these great characters and wonderful prose. Great times. Loving life.</p> <p>But then, my friends, comes the moment I shatter my own dreamy existence. For there I am, earlier today, standing in a bookstore browsing the shelves with a coffee, things are looking good - too good, one might say - when I spy the section dedicated to our man Mr. Abercrombie.</p> <p>Well, in my infinite wisdom I think &quot;boy, I sure do love the very first book so far in this <em>very long and expansive world</em>, I wonder what other thin

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I recently saw a video about the &quot;magic system paradox&quot; (tldw: magic systems don&#39;t feel like magic because they&#39;re systems and systems are understandable while magic should be something supernatural). I would be very interested to hear about your favourite magic in a work of fantasy to see if supernatural magic or systematic magic is enjoyed more. I feel like most answers will be magic systems since 1. there are way more of them and 2. they are just more memorable since they can be more specific and not just &quot;some magical power&quot;. Despite that I want to see if there are some non-system magics out there that have a special place in someones heart. And just because I&#39;m a nerd I want to hear as much as possible about any magic system you feel like infodumping about (even if you don&#39;t feel like they don&#39;t add much to what I talked about in this post)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https:/

I dont mind if the book is long but I am not the biggest fan of slow burn and that&#39;s why I have been putting off the farseer trilogy because I have heard that the books are really slow.

From his own mouth:</p> <blockquote> <p>I&#39;m not really a visual storyteller </p> </blockquote> <p>No deep characterization, conflicts solve only in couple of pages, stakes sound high but actually low how they they solve it very quickly.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So, I&#39;m a huge fan of Game of Thrones especially because of the massive lore and details of the story and i want to get into another fantasy universe to get hard into the lore. I have a list of some series and i wanted to debate about which one is the best lorewise.</p> <p>- Baldurs Gate Series: so baldurs gate 3 is one of my favourite games and i know DnD setting has a very heavy and good lore, but i played BG1 too and i think its dated and a little bit unplayable because of its gameplay so it takes away my desire to replay and play the next one.</p> <p>- Elder Scrolls: problably my first choice because i played skyrim and its one of may favourite games too and i knew that the lore is very complex a little bit like GoT (a lot of wars, rulers, politics etc) which is good but the first two games are very dated.</p> <p>-Dragon Age: i hear origins is a really good game but i know little about the franchise, and veilguard is really bad too from what 

## I feel like I see mostly the same stuff recommended when it comes to epic or high fantasy on tik Tok and some other places what are some older fantasy series that probably just don't get talked about cause they are older?
