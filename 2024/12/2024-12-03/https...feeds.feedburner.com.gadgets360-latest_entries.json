        "description": "A study published in Science Advances has discovered that ocean currents in the Bay of Bengal deviate leftward, contrary to Ekman\u2019s century-old theory. This anomaly, revealed through multi-year buoy data, suggests local factors influence wind-driven surface currents. Researchers highlight implications for climate models and propose a satellite system to monitor such patterns globally. The findings underscore the need for revisiting traditional assumptions about ocean behaviour, especially as climate change accelerates.",
