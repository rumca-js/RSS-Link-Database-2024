<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>after years of switching between flip phones and alternate OS&#39;s and dumbed-down smartphones, I think I&#39;ve realised that a &quot;partial degoogle&quot; is what&#39;s going to work best for me. I&#39;ve been using a flip phone consistently for a while and while i love it 90% of the time, that 10% of inconvenience is causing more obstacles than i think it&#39;s worth for me. I have a Pixel running GrapheneOS, but the hardware is finally starting to fail on me and I&#39;m running into a lot of issues w/r/t apps that i can&#39;t find alternatives to outside of Google Play. I can&#39;t afford to purchase a new Pixel and don&#39;t see much of a point spending too much money if I&#39;m going to &quot;dumb&quot; it down with a minimal launcher and strict time locks on apps. </p> <p>Im located in Australia, so we have brands like Oppo, Motorola, HMD, Opel, TCL, and Nokia available in the budget range. Does anyone have experience debloating/degoogling t

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>since i started degoogling one thing that came up in my mind is google photo&gt;&gt;. people in here suggest ente io for a replacement, however i start doubt what if i just dublicate my data to ente tooo? your answer is it&#39;s encrypted right? ok Now my question for this post is here? how do we know an app or provider is encrypted or end to end stuff ? how can we check about it ?it&#39;s not only abot enteio but also about degoogling. so can you guys provide an answer by using ente as example? TBH the rating of ente in app store is alil bit low that&#39;s why i doubt for that and plus i want to know what kind of apps and stuff are safe and good for privacy in advance too. so yeah special thanks to anyone who provide me anything</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/HelicopterFun8806"> /u/HelicopterFun8806 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/degoogle/comments/1h5lu82/just_started_degoog
