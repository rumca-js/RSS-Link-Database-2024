When plugged into a windows computer via USB-C it works immediately. I tried the supplied USB to 3 pin cable, as well as the USB-C cable with no luck. When either option is used im not seeing anything with lsusb, just my keyboard and 4 &quot;linux foundation root hubs&quot;. Tried other ports, and cables. Any help would be appreciated, its probably some small thing i have to enable but i have been unable to find it through much googling. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/kapaskae\"> /u/kapaskae </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1h5iwwp/touch_screen_not_detected_but_works_fine_on/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1h5iwwp/touch_screen_not_detected_bu",

I\u2019m doing a Computer Vision project and want a Pi Pico W to send images it takes with a camera to a computer where I can do some CV operations on it.
