Don’t let that spin you around though. While its sheer size is unrivaled, It’s not alone. More and more people are turning to mechanical energy storage systems, like flywheels, as the solution to large-scale energy woes. Why the sudden uptick of interest in this otherwise niche mechanical energy storage device? And can a spinning wheel really compete with lithium batteries and all the other energy storage systems available to us at the moment?
