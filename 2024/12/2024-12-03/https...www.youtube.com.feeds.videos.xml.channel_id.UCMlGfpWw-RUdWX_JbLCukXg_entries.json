Last year CppCon2023 talks and discussions have been followed up with continuous work in the specification. This talk advances in the topic by presenting a working implementation of usage of CPS files in Conan C++ package manager and describing the different challenges, approaches and lessons learned in the process.\n\nFirst, it will be presented how the current package information in ConanCenter allows the automatic creation of CPS files for many tens of thousands of packages for most of the popular C and C++ open source libraries. Even if that is not the end goal and expected flow of the CPS, this can provide an invaluable resource for experimentation and validation of ",
