<p class="has-text-align-none">Perhaps the most significant Nintendo game that’s never previously been rereleased is finally coming to the Switch. The 1989 NES version of <em>Tetris</em> will be <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1863750001781792782" data-type="link" data-id="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1863750001781792782">added to Nintendo Switch Online’s NES collection on Dec. 12</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">NES <em>Tetris</em> was released a few months after its slightly more famous sibling, also developed by Nintendo: the iconic Game Boy version of <em>Tetris</em>. But while that game had a color remaster in the form of <em>Tetris DX</em>, and a Virtual Console re
