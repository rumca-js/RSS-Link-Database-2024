With a series of recent updates to Parallel NFS in Linux 4.2, standard distributions now include support for extreme high-performance workloads and the distributed hybrid storage environments needed for AI and other GPU-based use cases. These enhancements enable modern data centers and clouds to support such workloads globally with standard Linux, and without the need for proprietary clients to support multi-vendor data environments.

In this session we will cover the latest kernel additions submitted by Hammerspace to enable such use cases, and look ahead to future enhancements coming in the next year.
