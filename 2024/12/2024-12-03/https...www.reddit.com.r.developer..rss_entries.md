<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Im Looking for a free API that can provide Year make and model of all USA driven cars. NHTSA was a good start but theres no way to filter to usa only. I want this for a website intergration that users will be able to select their car on a form. Similar to how keyy blue book works. </p> <p>Any ideas? Ive tried quite a few but some stop at 2022. I feel like theres no good solution out here. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Jay206"> /u/Jay206 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1h5w160/in_need_of_a_car_api/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1h5w160/in_need_of_a_car_api/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone 18M here from estonia As someone who aspires to be a saas dev/indie hacker/buildinpublic guy and has been inspired from people like greg isenberg and many more indie devs i have just joined a college that my father to pay for a hefty amount of money which is a degree in computer science i always had the plan to study aiml myself from books,free courses and youtube and practice alot on kaggle and just work very hard on my skills. But with the rising of ai taking over all this coding etc job scares me alot and is my aiml engineering knowledge will be worthless? And should i master how to do nocode ? I will obviously study a-lot about generative ai but should i not do aiml engineering is its nocode and those ai saas builder apps that does the work ? As i always thought being a very a good aiml engineer would always be a good backup option like i might take a well paying job with the startups don&#39;t work out properly I am sorry for the lan

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’m curious to hear your stories! How did you manage to escape the 9-to-5 grind or the full-time corporate life? Whether you started your own business, became a freelancer, or just found an unconventional way to make a living, I want to know:</p> <ul> <li>What was the turning point?</li> <li>How did you financially manage the transition?</li> <li>Any regrets or lessons learned?</li> </ul> <p>Since transitioning from a remote job to a full-time on-site role, I feel like I’m wasting my life. The daily routine has become draining.....waking up at 7 AM, spending the entire day at work, and returning home by 6 or 7 PM, only to eat and sleep. There&#39;s no room left for fun, relaxation, or personal time. It feels like life has been reduced to a never-ending cycle of work and exhaustion.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/sunnyazee"> /u/sunnyazee </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/develope
