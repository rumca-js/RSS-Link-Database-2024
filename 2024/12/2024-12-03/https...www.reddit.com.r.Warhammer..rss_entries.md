<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I&#39;m putting together my first space marine army. After getting bits here and there painting various schemes thinking I would never bite here I am. Deciding on going the ultramarine route. I opted for the Eagle warriors. Now I want my models to loom a little more interesting. Looking at eagle shoulder pads havking apart my stormbringer models I&#39;m not entirely pleased. This is going to take alot more of my time and patience to get into the next part of the hobby. So I&#39;m thinking maybe using some space wolf bits using the eagle warriors paint scheme might be easier. But I now need lore help. Any opinions welcome. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/CountJangles"> /u/CountJangles </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer/comments/1h5m8tn/chapter_help/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer/comments/1h5m8tn/chapter_help/">[comments]</a

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello everyone. I&#39;ve been with the fandom for a few years now and I&#39;ve been reading a few books. Mostly the first edition lore books from Age of sigmar. Namely I finished reading the hardback core rule books from first edition, the Realmgate lore books, the giant battletome ones, and I recently am awaiting some more rule books for some of the factions, mostly from the Order side of things and get a good perspective and lore.</p> <p>My question is are there more lore books that I should look into in the first edition of Age of Sigmar? I know of the 10 part series of the realmgate wars. But are there are more stories surrounding the first edition? I know there is not many books compared to 40k, but I would like to start somewhere and I wanted to try out the first edition.</p> <p>If anyone has any good suggestions or extra lore books that focus on the first edition, or all of them, I would like to know.</p> <p>Thank you.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->

After the holidays the price for the miniatures with a 10% discount from Amazon should bring the total price down to 336.60.</p> <p>The amount some scalpers are reselling for is more than both the Amazon deal and the full price of the combined miniatures.
