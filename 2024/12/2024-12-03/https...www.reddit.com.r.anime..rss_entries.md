<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>It was an anime where a young man goes to a different fantasy world. In it there are these artifacts called errands (I think, this could be me mishearing/remembering). The MC had a ring that he could use to summon powers to help fight, and it was a gold band with a red gem I believe. There were a few different ethereal characters that interacted with the MC, and I believe one of the big fights was with a dragon early on. </p> <p>I admit I was very young when I watched this so apologies if I get some of the details wrong, but this thing has been stuck in my craw for over two decades. I’m 95% sure it’s not Saint Seiya, Magic Knight Reyearth, Mon Calle Knights, or The Vision of Escaflowne, though each kinda has the same aesthetic and came out around the time I’m looking for. If this isn’t enough detail let me know, this is kinda a last ditch effort to try and remember what this is before I chalk it up to a wild dream I had as a kid. Thanks in advance!!<

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>(context) so around a year or 2 ago now i watched this really old looking anime about this 12 year old girl and she joins this weird circus group where she basically gets tormented by these people. i know that this anime was made in the 20th century but i cant seem to remember it. I just know my friend found out about it and we watched it before obviously getting mortified at the contents in it, i suddenly remembered it existed and we both tried looking for it but we cant find it. Most of the things we remember from it was this trans girl threw a dog onto the ground and it like exploded sorta, then there was the main character who was a 12-13 year old girl who i think got groomed of some sorts by the other people and she married some old guy, there was some guy with bandages, a lady who has i think black hair? and there was some guy that was like a father figure to this girl. if anyone can find it pls tell me, its honestly driving me crazy.</p> </div
