Sadly, I have not had much opportunity to play the latest edition, this is something that I am hoping to rectify next year. However, I always follow the releases with great interest and have often purchased some of the gangs and models just because I love the characterful sculpts so much. I find they are perfect for using in narrative games of 40k as well.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://taleofpainters.com/2024/12/showcase-van-saar-tek-hunters-orrus-spyre-hunters-inc-painting-guides/\">Showcase: Van Saar Tek Hunters &amp; Orrus Spyre Hunters (inc. painting guides)</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://taleofpainters.com\">Tale of Painters</a>.</p>\n",
