In today’s show – From satirical skits to global politics, we dive into the headlines shaping narratives and raising questions. Alec Baldwin's latest SNL parody sets the tone, but the drama ramps up as Hunter Biden faces mounting criticism as allegations of a protective pardon for the "Biden crime family" make waves.
