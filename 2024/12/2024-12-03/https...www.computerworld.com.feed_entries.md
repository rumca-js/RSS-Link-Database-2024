<p>Dr. Adam Rodman, a physician and researcher at Beth Israel Medical Center in Boston, was shocked by <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2825395" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the results of an experiment</a> he ran comparing the diagnostic abilities of doctors to <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/1627101/what-are-large-language-models-and-how-are-they-used-in-generative-ai.html">generative artificial intelligence</a> (genAI) tools.
