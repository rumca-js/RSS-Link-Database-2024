For example when I look far it\u2019s blurry and even close up it\u2019s still not good graphics. When I go to graphics in the settings everything but overall graphics is on epic.

Is this a limitation of the hardware or is there settings I should try?

I can get Quest 3 new for ~2500PLN (about $600). For same price or slightly more I can get second-hand Vive Pro 2. For half that, used Quest 2, Pico 4 or Vive Cosmos. For $250 or even less I can get something like HP Reverb G2 or Samsung Oddysey+, but unless I&#39;m mistaken, these are now just very expensive bricks given that WMR is not supported anymore.</p> <p>Question is, are any of these older headsets still any good? Is going second-hand a reasonable option or should I just go and buy the Quest 3?</p> <p>EDIT: Should probably mention that intended use is mainly PCVR.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Inside-Bug2781\"> /u/Inside-Bug2781 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1h5so00/are_older_headsets_still_worth_it/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a hre",

That being said, I&#39;m seeking to build two setups - one that will allow me to still see the world around me and another for immersive video viewing and gaming.</p> <p>The view through headset will be used mostly for work - seeking to have a large format Windows PC based workspace. 100&quot; spreadsheets? Ideally. Augmented Reality? Even better.</p> <p>As for gaming and movie viewing, probably EVE Online and Doom 3 &amp; Quake --- I imagine anything that will handle the games will easily handle movies. </p> <p>Pretty sure my current setup will drive it, just not sure what interface to go with.
