        "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the UK legalizes so-called \"assisted dying.\" The bill supposedly allows for euthanasia only under limited and tightly controlled circumstances. But, if we've learned anything from every other country that's legalized this form of state-sanctioned murder, it never stays limited or controlled for very long. Also, the media tries to grapple with the Hunter Biden pardon, to hilarious effect. In the year of our Lord 2024\u2014almost 2025\u2014Taylor Lorenz lashes out at people who don't wear masks. And in our Daily Cancelation, we'll see what the feminist ecosexuals in academia are up to. Nothing normal, we can assume.\n\nEp.1497\n\n- - -\n\nBecome a DailyWire+ member and watch the full show: https://bit.ly/4bEQDy6\n\nLIKE & SUBSCRIBE for new videos every day. https://www.youtube.com/c/MattWalsh?sub_confirmation=1\n\n- - -\n\nDailyWire+:\n\nOur largest sale of the year is live NOW!
