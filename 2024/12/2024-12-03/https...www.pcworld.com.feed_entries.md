<p>Whew, there were some fantastic deals to be had on OLED gaming monitors across Black Friday and Cyber Monday.

<p>Say what? If you’re hearing a new and more natural voice coming from your Google smart speakers, you’re not the only one. </p>



<p>A smattering of Google Home users are reporting that their Nest speakers are—when asked the right voice command—chatting with a new voice, a sign that the promised Gemini makeover for Google Assistant is starting to roll out. </p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/googlehome/comments/1h568ie/further_to_my_earlier_postits_switching_between/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.reddit.com/r/googlehome/comments/1h568ie/further_to_my_earlier_postits_switching_between/">video posted on Reddit</a>, a Google Nest Mini user asked “Hey Google, what’s up,” and got an unusually loquacious reply in a new voice: </p>
