Use code UNDECIDED at the link below and get 60% off an annual plan:\u00a0http://incogni.com/undecided At 30 MW, the Dinglun Flywheel Energy Storage Power Station is likely the biggest Flywheel Energy Storage System on the planet. Don\u2019t let that spin you around though. While its sheer size is unrivaled, It\u2019s not alone. More and more people are turning to mechanical energy storage systems, like flywheels, as the solution to large-scale energy woes. Why the sudden uptick of interest in this otherwise niche mechanical energy storage device? And can a spinning wheel really compete with lithium batteries and all the other energy storage systems available to us at the moment?\n\nWatch How Solid State Cooling Could Change Everything https://youtu.be/GHl6buYjZGE?list=PLnTSM-ORSgi7uzySCXq8VXhodHB5B5OiQ\n\nVideo script and citations:\nhttps://undecidedmf.com/how-this-mechanical-battery-is-making-a-comeback/\n\nGet",
