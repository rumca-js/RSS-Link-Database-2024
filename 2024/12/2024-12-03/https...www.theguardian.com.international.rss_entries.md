<p>Pleasure and politics collide in Kaur’s work, which invites our curiosity again and again </p><p>I wanted Jasleen Kaur to win as soon as I’d seen this year’s prize show. Her work made me come back again, and simply to be there on her gigantic synthetic Axminster carpet.</p><p>Kaur invites our curiosity. Pio Abad’s work, mostly made during a residency at Oxford’s Ashmolean Museum, is similarly rich with detail and stories, but felt illustrational, overdependent on the explanatory wall labels. Delaine Le Bas’s textile hangings and tents and impromptu drawings, with their skulking figures, their animals and printed footsteps on the floor, ended up too winsome to take seriously.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2024/dec/03/turner-prize-jasleen-kaurs-winning-welcoming-ode-to-glasgow">Continue reading...</a>

The $56bn pay package awarded by Tesla to Elon Musk in 2018 was indeed a governance abomination, a stitch-up in which ordinary shareholders weren’t told about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/jan/30/elon-musk-tesla-pay-package-too-much-judge-rules">the “deeply flawed” process</a> whereby a “superstar ceo” secured wildly over-the-top terms from pliant directors.</p><p>Her closely argued ruling in January spelt it out in persuasive detail. The company had “inaccurately described key directors as independent and misleadingly omitted details about the process”. Ira Ehrenpreis, the lead director negotiating for Tesla, had a 15-year business relationship with Musk. Another member of the working group regularly went on holiday with Musk’s family.

<p>The Britpop bass player’s engaging memoir of the last Blur reunion reads like a freewheeling adventure without consequences – except when he crosses ‘the boss’</p><p>In December 2022, the four members of Blur reconvened to discuss the possibility of a reunion. This surprised bassist Alex James, as he admits in his new memoir, because their last meeting, eight years previously, “was a car crash that had haunted me daily ever since”. While the reader is curious to know whether it was<em> his</em> driving that caused this metaphorical pile-up, James opts not to elucidate. Where band business is concerned, he is required always to tread carefully. Diplomacy is key.</p><p>Anyway. At this latest meeting, singer Damon Albarn – “the boss”, as James refers to him – asks what everybody has been up to. Albarn’s output was familiar to all, of course: Gorillaz, solo albums and a Chinese opera knocked out before lunchtime. Guitarist Graham Coxon was writing music for films, while drummer Dave R

<p>Ruth Beckermann’s compassionate documentary is testament to a diverse group of delightful seven-year-olds and the brilliance of their dedicated teacher</p><p>There are some big personalities in the class of seven-year-olds in an inner city Vienna primary school in this rather lovely and compassionate documentary. It follows three years in the life of the class, taught for the entire time by one teacher. Ilkay Idiskut is young and dedicated, and she combines the best of teaching styles: a warm and patient listener, but insisting on structure and discipline. The little faces of her pupils look crestfallen when they disappoint her. Ilkay is too good a teacher to have favourites – and the film’s title, Favoriten, is the name of the ethnically diverse district in Vienna where the school is located.</p><p>The kids are at that delightful unselfconscious age when they dance like no one is watching, wiggling and wriggling with abandon during the five minute dance breaks to move their bodie

<p>A stylish love letter to the Ukrainian port charts its transformation from exotic mafia capital to beacon of freedom and, now, battered Russian target</p><p>In 1994 the writer Julian Evans went on a 10-day cruise down the Dnipro River. Ukraine had won its independence three years before. The journey took Evans along an ancient route used by the “restless Vikings” who established Kyiv. His ship – the Viktor Glushkov – stopped off at Crimea and Yalta. Its final destination was the glittering Black Sea port of Odesa.</p><p>Evans was a veteran traveller. Nonetheless, the city was “unlike any place I had visited”, he writes – a “country beyond the back of a wardrobe” where anything could happen. It had merchants’ houses, acacia trees, a dandyish 19th-century opera and ballet theatre, and wide neoclassical boulevards. It was ostentatious and self-made. There was <em>kolorit</em>: exoticism and flash.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/dec/03/undefeatable-odesa-in-love-a
