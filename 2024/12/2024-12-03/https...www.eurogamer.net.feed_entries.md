<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stalker-2">Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl</a> was in a bit of a state when it launched earlier this month, as developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/gsc-game-world">GSC Game World</a> was all too aware. It took less than a day for the studio to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-dev-acknowledges-rough-edges-says-its-monitoring-feedback">acknowledge</a> the post-apocalyptic  shooter's "rough edges", and it's been flinging out fixes since then.

As well as being the fastest Intel GPUs ever made, the $249 B580 and $219 B570 are also equipped with Intel's second-generation XeSS upscaling with frame generation and latency reduction. That's a promising recipe, especially if Intel is able to continue shoring up its driver support for newer games as we approach the release dates of December 13th (B580) and January 16th (B570). </p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-intel-announces-arc-b-series-graphics-cards-with-xess-2-frame-generation">Read more</a></p>

<img src="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/ps1_k9eTTTv.png?width=1920&height=1920&fit=bounds&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp" /> <p>This was originally going to be a list of the best PlayStation games. It's the 30th anniversary of Sony's industry-shaking console, so it made sense to pick the best, but that's not so simple when looking at games that are decades old. What does "best" even mean when looking back that far? A lot of retro games have been superseded on newer platforms, and some of the classics were bettered multiple times on the original hardware.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-10-ps1-games-that-mattered-the-most">Read more</a></p>
