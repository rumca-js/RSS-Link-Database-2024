<p>After years of waiting, smart home manufacturer Eve Systems has finally given its Android customers what they really wanted: an app. </p>



<p>More than two years in the making, the Eve app for Android promises to unlock smart features that were previously available only to iOS users, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/3/24312078/eve-android-app-launches-eve-thermo-thread-matter" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/3/24312078/eve-android-app-launches-eve-thermo-thread-matter">according to The Verge</a>. </p>



<p>But before you get too excited about controlling your Eve devices with Android, there’s a big caveat to the news. For now, the new Eve for Android app works only with a single device: the <a href="https://www.techadvisor.com/article/721058/eve-thermo-review.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techadvisor.co

<p>Intel has taken enormous pains to prevent a repeat of the driver woes that plagued its first-generation “Alchemist” GPUs inside its second-generation “Battlemage” cards, Intel fellow Tom Petersen told The Full Nerd podcast on Tuesday morning. </p>



<p>“It’s a complex problem, but we have invested gi-namic resources into addressing it,” Petersen, also known as “TAP,” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7mjKeck7k0">told The Full Nerd crew</a>, hosted by PCWorld regulars, as <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2543041/intels-249-arc-b580-is-the-gpu-weve-begged-for-since-the-pandemic.html">Intel launched the Intel “Battlemage” or B580 cards.</a> “It’s like enormous, and gigantic.”</p>

<p>Most people when trying to maximize their gaming experience focus on the quality of the game and their computer’s processing power. But an often-overlooked variable that can greatly affect the experience is a decent gaming headset. It’s especially important if you plan on getting the best out of multiplayer games, where you’re just as likely to use your headset to chat with friends as you are to use it as a strategic tool to help you win. </p>



<p>As you’d expect, there’s no shortage of gaming headsets out there. No one wants to wade through the myriad options only to settle on one that ends up leaving you disappointed. That’s why I’ve done all the heavy lifting for you, testing a ton of different headsets to find the best. </p>

<p>When looking for a top-notch VPN, the two most important things to look for are privacy and speed. While privacy is crucial to a good VPN, speed shouldn’t be overlooked. Faster speeds mean quicker file downloads and website load times, higher-quality streaming, and just a better all-around experience.</p>



<p>I’ve tested numerous VPNs and run their servers through countless speed tests to determine the fastest services based on network averages. My picks showcase the very best with not only the fastest download speeds, but also the fastest upload speeds, and more. Read below to see PCWorld’s curated list of the fastest VPNs available now.</p>

<p>8BitDo makes mechanical keyboards now, and they’re pretty good even if you’re not into the NES aesthetic. Since introducing the Retro Keyboard last year, the company has made several more versions, including ones that celebrate the IBM Model M and Commodore 64, among others. But the newest Xbox version is really plucking at my 90s-kid heartstrings.</p>



<p>This is almost the exact same <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2121826/8bitdo-retro-keyboard-review.html">keyboard that I reviewed a year ago</a>, just redone in translucent green plastic. But unlike 8BitDo’s previous designs, which were evocative but not officially branded, this one has Microsoft’s official Xbox seal emblazoned on it. It also gets an RGB lighting upgrade (which didn’t really make sense for the previous 80s-style designs). Note the multi-colored arrow keys mirroring the origin

<p>If your PC restarts unprompted, freezes, or programs crash, you could have a RAM problem on your hands. To find out whether RAM really is the problem, you can use your PC’s memory diagnostics tool to find out. We’ll show you every step in the process.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-to-use-windows-memory-diagnostics">How to use Windows memory diagnostics</h2>



<p>The Windows memory diagnostics tool requires a restart and performs tests during the startup process. Normally it works in standard mode and performs two test runs before the computer restarts and displays the test results. You can also run advanced tests where you customize the type of tests and the number of runs. To set up the tool, you’ll need to schedule it for the next reboot. </p>

<p>It’s been a few months since <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2416966/nzxt-wants-you-to-rent-a-gaming-desktop-pc.html">NZXT began its Flex subscription service</a> for renting gaming desktop PCs. Even at launch, the proposition was obviously not great in terms of value… but that’s par for the course for any kind of rental, whether it’s an apartment or an armchair.</p>



<p>But YouTube channel GamersNexus conducted a deep investigative dive into the program — and found some shocking results.</p>



<p>In short, GamersNexus accuses NZXT of running a full-on scam, taking advantage of those who can’t afford to buy (or even borrow-and-buy) a full-power gaming PC. The hour-long report documents skewed value propositions that have you paying more than five times the worth of a gaming PC in “small” month-to-month rental charges over five years, for a mac

<p>Now, the makers of Arc have unveiled the first taste of their next product, which happens to be yet another web browser — except this one is an AI-powered “smart browser” called Dia.</p>

<p>Well, well, well. What a surprise to see Samsung’s massive 49-incher of a gaming monitor drop to a price that’s lower than what it was on Black Friday and Cyber Monday.

<p>Intel heard your screams of anguish, PC gamers. Budget graphics cards that are actually worth your money have all but disappeared this pandemic/crypto/AI-crazed decade, with modern “budget” GPUs going for $300 or more, while simultaneously being gimped with substandard memory configurations that limit your gaming to 1080p resolution unless you make some serious visual sacrifices.</p>



<p>No more.</p>



<p>Today, Intel announced the $249 Arc B580 graphics card (launching December 13) and $219 Arc B570 (January 16), built using the company’s next-gen “Battlemage” GPU architecture. The Arc B580 not only comes with enough firepower to best Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 4060 in raw frame rates, it has a 12GB memory system target-built for 1440p gaming – something the 8GB RTX 4060 sorely lacks despite costing more.</p>
