<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Not even sure if this is the right sub. </p> <p>But I saw a Japanese gaming ad earlier this year and now I canâ€™t find it! It followed a young kid playing a certain game on early consoles, then playing the same game on later consoles as he got older. Not sure if it was an ad for a game or a console! It was nostalgic as hell and almost brought a tear to my eye.</p> <p>Can anyone help? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/DukeSteel"> /u/DukeSteel </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1h615vm/japanese_gaming_ad/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1h615vm/japanese_gaming_ad/">[comments]</a></span>

I don&#39;t know if it was standard across the country or just a state thing or even a county thing but in Long Island, New York, in the 90s, we had this program on the school computers that looked like a classroom and clicking parts of the image would open the various applications. For example, if you clicked the notepad on the desk, it opened a text editor, if you clicked the trash can, it opened recycle bin, etc. It served as a way for them to block students from accessing other Windows features.
