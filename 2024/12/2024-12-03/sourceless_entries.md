About me My name is Eduardo Rodriguez.
I am a full-stack software engineer currently working at they consulting.
I fluently speak Spanish, German, English and Catalan.
In my day-to-day work I mostly do backend stuff in Go, use Postgres, write infrastructure as code in Terraform (for AWS and/or Azure) and do some frontend stuff with React in TS.
You can find me on GitHub and 🦞Lobsters.

After getting to work on some personal projects using Go+HTMX+Templ this year, I have decided to give up on using React on any personal projects.
You can actually find a lot of compelling arguments for ditching React in favor of HTMX in the essays found in the HTMX official website. But I feel that not that many people are speaking about dependency management fatigue.
What is dependency management fatigue? After working on my last personal project that used React (an interactive Catalan dictionary), I realized that I was spending too much time dealing with dependency updates of mostly React packages. I would update my packages to their latest release, only to realize that their APIs had breaking changes that forced me to invest time refactoring my code.

Just before Donald Trump took office the first time, he held a press conference, announcing that he would turn over control of his business empire to his sons. He said he wanted to address concerns about conflicts of interest even though he maintained he didn't really have to. Saying, "I could actually run my business. I could actually run my business and run government at the same time. I don't like the way that looks, but I would be able to do that if I wanted to."Trump's second term may put that theory to the test. The former and future president hasn't yet announced any plan to wall himself off from his businesses while in office, and Trump's businesses like his many hotels and resorts could benefit substantially from his actions as President.For sponsor-free episodes of Consider This, sign up for Consider This+ via Apple Podcasts or at plus.npr.org.Email us at considerthis@npr.org.
