<p>As enterprise demand for building multi-agent systems continues to grow, data infrastructure services providing firm, Databricks, is updating its Mosaic AI Agent Evaluation module with a new synthetic data generation API that will help enterprises evaluate agents faster.</p>



<p>Multi-agent systems, otherwise known as <a href="https://www.cio.com/article/3596212/is-now-the-right-time-to-invest-in-implementing-agentic-ai.html">Agentic AI</a>, have caught the fancy of enterprises as these agents go further than just generating code or content for human review. Agentic AI systems can follow instructions, make decisions, and take actions much as a human worker would, without human intervention.</

<p>I recall this as if it was yesterday. I entered the conference room to talk about <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2683784/what-is-cloud-computing.html">cloud computing</a> and 5G. I gave this type of presentation often a few years ago. The executives were excited about 5G’s potential. I took a deep breath, knowing I had to voice my concerns. “Forgive my candor,” I began, “but the promises surrounding 5G are exaggerated. We’re banking on a technology that hasn’t yet delivered on its hype, and given the current adoption patterns, it may not.”</p>



<p>The room fell silent, disbelief etched across their faces. “David, you’re mistaken,” one executive replied, with a tone of some condesc

<p>At Campfire, we launched a consumer AI chat product called Cozy Friends on Steam and mobile on October 12. Imagine Animal Crossing or The Sims with AI agents. In the first 30 days, users exchanged more than 1.7M messages with our AI agents. This beat our best expectations and validated that we’d finally gotten good at conversational AI products. </p>



<p>It took us a year of building to get there. We had to build a ton of tools, some of them twice over, and bang our heads against various walls for months to finally make a decent AI chat product. </p>



<p>I want to build better AI chat products faster, and help others avoid our painful experience. To that end, I’m open sourcing all of my lea
