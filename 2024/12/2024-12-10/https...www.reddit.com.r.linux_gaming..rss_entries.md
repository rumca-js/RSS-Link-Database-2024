## Curious if anyone with an AMD GPU was running into a crash that caused screen to go black and GPU fans to ramp to 100%. Issue was happening to me sometime between April of this year and last month

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey all,</p> <p>The reason I&#39;m asking this was because some time around April, I was testing out an AMD GPU and I originally tried it on Kubuntu 24.4 which at the time was packaged with Mesa version 24.0.9. Everything ran fine but I ended up moving away from kubuntu after about a month and tried Pop OS which is where I noticed the following:</p> <p>After about 15 minutes of playing a game with demanding graphics, the screen would just go black and my GPU fans would kick up to 100% speed. My PC case has a physical reboot button which didn&#39;t work to reboot the PC when this crash happened; I had to turn it off by holding the power button. </p> <p>After turning it back on I couln&#39;t find anything in any logs that would indicate a fault with the GPU that caused the crash (or any fault at all for that matter) and I tried this on other distros as well such as Fedora, Nobara, Bazzite, Arch, and Endeavour all of which had the same issue.</p> <p>Run

The flight stick itself doesn&#39;t show up in KDE System Settings anymore, and the Throttle Rocker and Stick Twist axes are not detected at all by any games. Running cat /dev/input/js0 and moving those axes fills my terminal with some data, so the stick itself is definitely sending information on those two inputs, just that something in the OS doesn&#39;t process them properly. Any advice as to how I can get it to work again?</p> <p>Edit: Those two axes worked flawlessly before and I could manage the stick in KDE System Settings without issues.

If any, but I&#39;m greatly unsure. I never used Linux and nor have I gamed on Linux before. </p> <p>Also with Rise and Fall Civilizations at War by Midway.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>After 5 years with a Win10 rig, I decided to build a SFF AMD rig. After shopping around different distros I landed on Garuda KDE, an Arch Linux build with KDE Plasma desktop environment. I couldn’t be happier, everything runs fast and smooth, and I don’t get any annoying pop-ups or ads. Even installing new programs and packages is far more straightforward than windows ever seemed. Currently playing Satisfactory, Valheim, Space Marine 2, and GR:Wildlands, and KSP1. Overall it seems that these games use far fewer resources than they would on Windows, and run very smoothly.</p> <p>Ive had a few issues with getting Easy AntiCheat to work though, if anybody has advice I’d love to hear it. </p> <p>Build Deets if you care to know: Ryzen 7700 (Noctua Ghost Edition cooler) ASRock B650I Lightning WiFi 32GB Ram at 5400MHz 2x m.2 SSD’s Coolermaster SFX PSU (with a noctua fan mod) Louqe Raw S1 case</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https:

However, I hadn&#39;t dabbled in UV/OCing my hardware until now - and I kind of want to considering what I&#39;ve got to throw around here.

But it isn&#39;t! If I play on another computer I can play with that Account without a problem. This means that my installation is faulty right? But with another Account I can play without a problem on my system.</p> <p>What I already tried:</p> <p>Verifying game files. (No corrupted files found and it also wouldn&#39;t explain the mistake in only one specific account) Reinstalling CS2.
