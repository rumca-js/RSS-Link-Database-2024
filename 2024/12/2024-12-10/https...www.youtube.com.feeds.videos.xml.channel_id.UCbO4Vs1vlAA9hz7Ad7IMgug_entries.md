It's 2001 and the most popular way for people of a certain age to spend their time with clothes on was sitting on the couch, consuming questionable substances and mashing large corded controllers until our thumbs bled. 

Feel old yet? Well 25 years later Mantic has given us a higher resolution and yet lower scaled adaptation of the BUNGIE classic HALO, right on your kitchen table. Let's check it out! 

Thanks to Mantic for the copy to review!
