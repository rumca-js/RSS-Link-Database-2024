But After reading Assassin\u2019s Apprentice years ago, I had no desire to read the rest. I recently picked up Ship of Magic, Giving her another chance because dang it, she just keeps cropping up as being an amazing writer. And while yes, her world building and characters are deep. I\u2019m also very bored. I\u2019m 80 pages in, and she has yet to establish an actual story. It just keeps introducing new characters, over and over.</p> <p>So I\u2019m just wondering, before I give up on this book. Does it like\u2026 go somewhere? Does it bring all the elements together at some point? Or does it just trudge along for another few hundred pages. It might just not be for me?

I read the summaries, but they just don\u2019t feel right. Am I approaching this the wrong way?

As an adult I\u2019ve read: - Berserk - game of thrones, half of a clash of kings (great books but lost interest due to GRRM\u2019s delay and the trash ending of the show) - a little bit of the Witcher - The Shades of magic trilogy - mistborn era 1 &amp; 2 - stormlight archive up to book 4 - one piece (fav manga if it counts)</p> <p>I do not mind complex or simple prose as long as the story, characters and setting are intriguing and moving.

Imagine of you took our lungs, copied them, turned them around and placed them behind the original lungs, voiding all organs in the way. These 4 lungs being needed for a centuars large body. While a century would also have two larger stomachs ontop of eachother in the abdomen. These two stomachs, much like a cows 4, allow centaurs to eat hay and leaves and such, but also raw meat. As human food is often somewhat pre-digested before consumption via cooking, the first stomach tackles this problems. The acid of witch having a different make up then the second, ilemenating risks of most disease and sickness that come with raw meat. The second ofcourse finishes the breaking down of said food.",

The book is set in the modern day but the story itself is set all over the world and even other words at times, from what I can remember the were 4-6 other words. The main character is a fully self taught portal mage with extremely fine control over his mana. One of the key plot lines it that in the first book he helps a healer \u201cdiscover\u201d harmful healing so that she can be a fully fledged healer, however the government already knew about harmful healing and kidnapped her and brought her to one of the other worlds so that the would be trained as a soldier however the main character attempts to break her out of the black site, and in the process he floods the cite with lava.
