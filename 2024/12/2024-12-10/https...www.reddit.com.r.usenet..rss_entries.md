<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Excuse my ignorance on the topic - I just started using Usenet last week in the hope of finding some current Italian shows. Being out of Italy, I have to use a VPN to stream them via Italian streaming services and download for offline consumption. My hope was to find some content on Usenet for easier access.</p> <p>To my disappointment, I can&#39;t find anything on the popular indexer with my top Usenet provider - I picked them based on researching this sub. I searched for related questions in the sub and found some discussions from about a year ago, which had disappointing conclusions. Just checking if something may have changed since. With a little hope, I&#39;m posting the question anyway.</p> <p>If someone can suggest other alternatives to my streaming solution via VPN (e.g. torrents, mobile apps), it would be greatly appreciated.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Dream2Real"> /u/Dream2Real </a

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m surprised it hasn&#39;t been discussed around here...</p> <blockquote> <p>This is your final opportunity to get our incredible bundle for just $1.67/mo!<br/> After this deal is over, we’ll never be offering this price again. Take advantage of this offer today before it’s gone for good!</p> <p>This is the last day to get our $1.67 Black Friday offer. You won&#39;t be able to get Newshosting for this price once it&#39;s gone.</p> </blockquote> <p>Eweka also advertises it&#39;s 2,50 EUR deal, but uses phrases like &quot;this offer will be gone soon&quot; instead of claiming that the price will not be offered again.</p> <p>Do you believe it&#39;s true? Should I stack up these subscriptions for years to come today?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Plastic_Football3363"> /u/Plastic_Football3363 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1haynag/newshosting_never_again_dea
