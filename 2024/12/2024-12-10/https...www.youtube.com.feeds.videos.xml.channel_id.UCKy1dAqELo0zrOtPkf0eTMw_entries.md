In today's Daily Fix:
Path of Exile 2 developer Grinding Gear Games is addressing player concerns that the game doesn't feel rewarding enough. An upcoming update will feature changes to what loot drops from rare monsters, and the difficulty in which enemies scale. Each map will also have a minimum number of rares. Grinding Gear Games also promised to address other issues in the future. In other news, Geralt voice actor Doug Cockle apparently got in some trouble with CD Projekt RED after spilling the beans on The Witcher 4. In a previous video, Cockle claimed that Geralt will be in The Witcher 4, codenamed Polaris, but he won't be the lead. Cockle recently clarified that CDPR told him they haven't released anything about the game's story or characters, and aren't sure where Cockle got his info from. And finally, a boss rush mode is coming to Black Myth: Wukong, but be prepared for an intense challenge as some of the bosses will have new moves.

The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim, reviewed by Emma Stefansky. Narrated by Erik Adams.

The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim is more interesting as a concept than as a finished film, with a runtime that will test the limits of even the most seasoned anime fans. Director Kenji Kamiyama’s foray into the world of Middle-earth is thrilling at times, but dull at others, with a choppy animation style and a plot made up of recycled bits of more beloved films that only serve to remind you of something else you wish you were watching instead.

Watch our IGN Marvel Rivals review! Neither the MCU nor the hero shooter genre are at the glorious heights experienced by both in the past decade, but that isn’t stopping Marvel Rivals from doing everything it can to be a success story today. Approachable, yet with a high skill ceiling to reach for, it's consistently a great time no matter which fan-favourite comic book character and accompanying skillset is at your fingertips. It may be following closely in the slipstream of the hero shooter games that have come before it, but by doing so Marvel Rivals has firmly placed itself in a strong position to take the crown for itself.

Marvel Rivals reviewed by Simon Cardy on PS5 Pro (PlayStation 5 Pro). Marvel Rivals is also available on Xbox and PC.

However, when one of them leaves on a mission, he discovers secrets that have mutated not only the infected but other survivors too.

Directed by Danny Boyle and written by Alex Garland, 28 Years Later debuts in theaters on June 20, 2025. The film's executive producer is Cillian Murphy. It's produced by Andrew Macdonald, Peter Rice, Bernard Bellew, Danny Boyle, Alex Garland.

Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Rita’s Rewind reviewed by Will Borger on PlayStation 5, also available on PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.

Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Rita’s Rewind nails the look and feel of both Power Rangers and the classic arcade games it’s drawing inspiration from. While the Super Scaler levels can be a bit of a mixed bag, they sing when they work, and they’re still only manageably frustrating when they don’t. Everything else, though, rules — the gorgeous sprite work, bumping soundtrack, rock-solid beat ‘em up gameplay, in-jokes for fans, and other little touches like playable in-universe arcade games. And while nostalgia will certainly enhance the experience for some, you don’t have to know your Green Ranger from your Black Ranger to enjoy it. It might even give you an itch to revisit the classic games, or give the original television series a watch. You may not be able to go down to your local arcade anymore, but if Rita’s Rewind is any indication, you can alway

Path of Exile 2 reviewed in Early Access by Travis Northup on PC.

At its early access launch, Path of Exile 2 is already shaping up to be the sequel we’ve been waiting for. Everything from the refined action-RPG gameplay to the surprisingly fleshed-out endgame has seen major improvements, and the half of the story we’ve got so far shows plenty of promise, even if the setting feels a little generic in the realm of dark fantasy worlds. The downsi de of playing in early access, though, is that you’ll have to slog through all three acts twice to reach the endgame, the loot game still needs some major tweaking, and some mild-to-severe technical wonkiness threatens to take the wind out of your sails – but it’s nothing that makes me concerned for the future of this expansive sequel. Even while we wait for 1.0, Path of Exile 2 is already a stellar way to lose dozens of hours and a clear leap forward for the series.

Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 review by Seth Macy on PC, also available on Xbox Series X|S.

We have hit cruising altitude. You can safely unbuckle your seatbelt and move freely about the cabin. It was understandable to think Asobo Studio might not be able to capture the lightning in a bottle of 2020’s Flight Simulator again – but Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 is an astonishing follow-up once you take the time to get to know its new features now that its launch problems have been cleaned up. It's more than just simulating the experience of flying: you can use it to learn the technical side of how pilots actually fly planes, including the stuff that doesn't involve ailerons and elevators and trim thanks to the Flight Planner. Encountering some new term you don’t understand is just an exciting opportunity to learn, so you can fly virtual airplanes on a digital twin of the planet Earth with as much realism as is possible. It's not flawless, with some lingering problems in those new
