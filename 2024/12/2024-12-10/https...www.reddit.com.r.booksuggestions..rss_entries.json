I\u2019ve been diving into the works of George MacDonald lately, and I\u2019m amazed at how timeless his stories feel. He\u2019s often called the &quot;Father of Modern Fantasy&quot; and was a major influence on authors like C.S. Lewis, J.R.R. Tolkien, and even Lewis Carroll.</p> <p>Some of his best works include:</p> <p>Phantastes - A dreamlike fantasy about a mystical journey in Fairy Land. The Princess and the Goblin - A magical adventure with goblins, princesses, and hidden powers. At the Back of the North Wind - A poetic and philosophical tale about life, death, and destiny. Lilith - A dark and complex fantasy exploring redemption and the nature of reality.</p> <p>Have you read any of George MacDonald\u2019s works? Which book of his left the biggest impact on you?

I liked it, didn&#39;t love love it, but it was a fun and engaging read. Probably like a 6 or 7/10. </p> <p>Are the subsequent books (Son of a Witch, A Lion Among Men, and Out of Oz) worth giving a read? I find it interesting that they were all released AFTER Wicked the Musical debuted, though not sure what level of influence the musical had on the sequels.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/shandelion\"> /u/shandelion </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1haomja/if_i_enjoyed_wicked_by_gregory_maguire_are_the/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1haomja/if_i_enjoyed_wicked_by_gregory_maguire_are_the/\">[comments]</a></span>",
