All conclusions from some reviews online checked briefly, but... I really hoped that I as a player can hurt another player by sending my guest to his &quot;party&quot; and this mechanic is not in the game!

Anyone know some good euros with some party-style rules, either natively or with a house rule?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey fellow players,</p> <p>I love boardgames, love game design and love talking and discussing board games. While I would consider myself part of the hobby, I rarely consume online content. Often people classify boardgames as different types such as 4x and trick taking games. Some names are self explanatory (social deduction) but others are more difficult as a non native speaker. Do you guys have a source where I can read about the types of games or can u give me a quick rundown? :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Erzwungene_Jacke"> /u/Erzwungene_Jacke </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1hazwsl/types_of_board_games/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1hazwsl/types_of_board_games/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Was anyone else <em>really</em> frustrated by the solution to today&#39;s puzzle? I figured, hey, time travel! I went back and found the red solution for day 4, the blue solution for day 7, and the yellow solution for day 6. Which <em>should</em> have been the answer. But instead, we need to count digits on the picture and subtract one, which made far less sense and was far less creative a solution than looking at old puzzles.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone. I hope this question is okay. I live in Japan and it&#39;s quite humid here. Very hot in the summer. A lot of snow in the winter. Most older Japanese houses don&#39;t have central air and have little to no insulation, so the rooms are very hot or cold depending on the season. </p> <p>I have a few bookshelves worth of books and another large bookshelf with probably 100ish board games that I&#39;ll be keeping in a spare room. We will be living in this location for the next 5 or so years (taking care of family). </p> <p>I&#39;m wondering what would be the best sort of cover to use to cover these bookshelves to protect from dust, mold, etc.? I&#39;ve kept a cloth bed sheet over some of the book shelves in this particular room for the past few years and it has seemed to work well enough (all of the books in good condition still), but since I&#39;m moving a lot more items into this room, I wanted to check if there is something recommended that
