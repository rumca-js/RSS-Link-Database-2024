<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Nothing particularly inspired but romance with a super rich man who at first does not seem positively disposed to a relationship…in fact maybe he’s expected to go after someone in his “social circle.” Girl is poor but very smart…maybe they make an agreement between them first then slowly get feelings. Or maybe they hate each other at first. And I do appreciate some comedy. Girl has to be funny or sly or interesting…not a boring goody two shoes “im nOt LiKe tHe other GirLs” virgin type. </p> <p>It does not have to be Korean lol. It has to be in English or Spanish so I can read it. </p> <p>Thanks! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/cMeeber"> /u/cMeeber </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1hbei63/books_similar_to_kdrama_shows_like_business/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1hbei63/books_similar_to_kdrama_s

Ideally what I wish is for a book that contains an overview of film theory from its inception to around the turn of the century which contains the most prominent works of theory in different schools and eras. Obviously this won’t provide as deep of an overview of individual schools of theory as a book entirely dedicated to, for example; the Frankfurt school would, but I’m willing to sacrifice depth in exchange for coverage of more ideas. I’ve read a good amount of film theory but there are still plenty of notable writers and works that I’ve yet to sink into, and I am looking for this book as a place to start in order to gain a solid overview of film theory which I can then use to dive further into specific schools and writers which interest me.

The problem is that I see lots of suggestions that fit into this but I simply do not trust them at all when I see they recommend A court of thornes and roses. If you like this series stop reading rn😭 </p> <p>I hated this book so much I couldn’t even finish it. It was incredibly predictable, slow and the supposed sexy scenes actually gave me the biggest ick ever. The writing is seriously so bland and the love interest is just… I cant even express it. The characters are flat, I just genuinely never DNF books but I couldn’t. I cant understand why people said the characters were so complex and that it was so riveting. I literally will never trust any opinion you have on books now… It feels like something that should have stayed in wattpad. Anyways done with the roast session, I just really cant find recommendations they always end up mentioning ACOTAR😭 so any are welcome

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey fellow book lovers! I’ve been diving into the works of George MacDonald lately, and I’m amazed at how timeless his stories feel. He’s often called the &quot;Father of Modern Fantasy&quot; and was a major influence on authors like C.S. Lewis, J.R.R. Tolkien, and even Lewis Carroll.</p> <p>Some of his best works include:</p> <p>Phantastes - A dreamlike fantasy about a mystical journey in Fairy Land. The Princess and the Goblin - A magical adventure with goblins, princesses, and hidden powers. At the Back of the North Wind - A poetic and philosophical tale about life, death, and destiny. Lilith - A dark and complex fantasy exploring redemption and the nature of reality.</p> <p>Have you read any of George MacDonald’s works? Which book of his left the biggest impact on you?

The bride’s been an SA victim too and all she had to say was “oh, well [someone] was there for me after my SA.” They even made the guy a groomsman. It’s a whole story but I don’t want to say too much as this is a book suggestions subreddit. </p> <p>I’m looking for a book, ideally self-help (but other genres work too), with a passive aggressive title (I think they fake reading unless it’s a smut book).
