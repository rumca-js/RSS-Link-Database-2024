        "description": "From trains and traffic to concerts and sporting events, many cities around the world are dangerously loud. Noise pollution can have a huge impact on health and quality of life - causing stress and increasing risk for heart disease and other issues. So what are some of the tools that engineers have to limit loud noise?\n\nRaj Patel, an acoustics expert who helped design Manhattan\u2019s Little Island waterfront park, explains how noise pollution can be minimized in metropolises like New York City.\n\nChapters:\n0:00 Noise pollution in cities\n0:52 Street noise and parks\n2:57 Subways\n5:15 Building insulation\nConcert venue\n\nPro Perfected\nExperts in engineering and design break down a ubiquitous problem, examining how the world is built and what can make it better.\n\n#Noise #NewYork #WSJ",
