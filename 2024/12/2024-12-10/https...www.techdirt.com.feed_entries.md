While “AI” (language learning models) certainly could&#160;help&#160;journalism, the fail upward brunchlords in charge of most modern media outlets instead see the technology as a way to cut corners, undermine labor, badly automate low-quality, ultra-low effort, SEO-chasing clickbait, and rush undercooked solutions to nonexistent problems to market under the pretense of progress. For example, The Washington [&#8230;]

Over at MSNBC, I have a new piece debunking the false claims from many that Donald Trump’s pick to run the National Institutes of Health, Jay Bhattacharya, is somehow taking over the government agency that he believes coordinated “censorship” of his views on social media. Bhattacharya and his supporters have been making that claim for [&#8230;]

The war on stream-ripping sites waged by the music industry continues. And, as with any war, there is collateral damage. Now, as we&#8217;ve said for some time, this is an entirely unnecessary war to begin with.
