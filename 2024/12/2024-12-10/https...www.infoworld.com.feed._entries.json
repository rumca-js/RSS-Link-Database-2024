I entered the conference room to talk about <a href=\"https://www.infoworld.com/article/2683784/what-is-cloud-computing.html\">cloud computing</a> and 5G. I gave this type of presentation often a few years ago. The executives were excited about 5G\u2019s potential. I took a deep breath, knowing I had to voice my concerns. \u201cForgive my candor,\u201d I began, \u201cbut the promises surrounding 5G are exaggerated. We\u2019re banking on a technology that hasn\u2019t yet delivered on its hype, and given the current adoption patterns, it may not.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The room fell silent, disbelief etched across their faces. \u201cDavid, you\u2019re mistaken,\u201d one executive replied, with a tone of some condesc",

Imagine Animal Crossing or The Sims with AI agents.\u00a0In the first 30 days, users exchanged more than 1.7M messages with our AI agents. This beat our best expectations and validated that we\u2019d finally gotten good at conversational AI products.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It took us a year of building to get there. We had to build a ton of tools, some of them twice over, and bang our heads against various walls for months to finally make a decent AI chat product.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I want to build better AI chat products faster, and help others avoid our painful experience. To that end, I\u2019m open sourcing all of my lea",
