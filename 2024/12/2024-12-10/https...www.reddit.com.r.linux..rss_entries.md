<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>snaps are focused only on ubuntu and official ubuntu flavours (mainly due to the fact that it requires a specific apparmor, or it will run in classic mode, without sandbox). they are way better for people using it in enterprise compared to flatpaks, and support CLI. ubuntu core (the immutable version), also uses snap kernel and snap gnome.</p> <p>flatpaks works on any major distro, but they only support GUI software, and there is no paid support for them in enterprise world (if you pay for ubuntu pro and have a problem with snap packages, a canonical employee will help you fix it.)</p> <p>which one you think will still exist in the next years? imo: snaps, they are worse, but have more use-cases.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Zery12"> /u/Zery12 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1hbdfqb/which_one_will_win_in_the_long_term_snap_or/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>A week ago I posted a complaint about new Linux distros from an old timer. After a week of trying this and that, I thought I&#39;d share my experience because some people might find it useful. I&#39;m not looking for help or advice myself, but other peoples&#39; comments may also be useful for anyone shopping around.</p> <p>The occasion was getting a new motherboard, CPU and memory and assembling a new computer. It seemed like a good time to explore and experiment. My current computer is running pclinuxos and, after a long time, I&#39;ve gotten it configured in a way that I&#39;m really comfortable with.</p> <p>So, I tried Endeavour, MX Linux, pclinuxos, Debian, Devuan, and Mint. Endeavour was, in a way, the most intriguing, but I&#39;d find myself getting in some weird configuation and couldn&#39;t back out easily. (This happened with other distros as well.) Debian was the worst. When I started the installation disc it couldn&#39;t even figure out h
