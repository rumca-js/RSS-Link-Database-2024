The free-to-play online shooter pits some of Marvel's biggest guns--pun intended--against each other to take down Dr. Doom and Doom 2099. Patch 1 handles a lot of on-the-surface issues, but affects a few heroes including Dr. Strange. You can check out the full list below.</p><p>The big issue that was addressed involved players getting stuck on certain maps after being hit close to the edge. However, as the bug happens across multiple maps and areas, it might still be an issue elsewhere now.</p><p>\"However, further adjustments may still be needed to fully resolve the issue,\" the <a href=\"https://www.marvelrivals.com/gameupdate/20241210/41548_1199072.html\">recent blog post</a> read. \"So we ask for your understanding while we continue looking into it and working on",

Comedian and actor Sebastian Maniscalco, who voiced the character in the first film, recently discussed the possibility of coming back for the sequel, and he's not feeling very optimistic.</p><p>Maniscalco said he went to a Universal Studios theme park with his kids and hoped to show his children a stuffed animal based on Foreman Spike. However, the store didn't have one, and the lack of merchandise for his character leads Maniscalco to believe Foreman Spike is not set to return.</p><p>\"No Spike, no nothing. It stopped at me. It was every other character, and then me, I have no animal, no stuffy, no nothing. So, the fact that I didn't have a stuffed animal is not giving me a lot of confidence that I'm coming back for the sequel. I haven't heard anything, so your guess is as good as mine,\" he told <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/super-mario-bros-movie-2-foreman-spike-return-sebas",
