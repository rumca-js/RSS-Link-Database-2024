After all, they've made it this far by taking chances. But these birds really take the cake when it comes to daredevil stunts, all in the name of food, love, or just for fun. From method-acting killdeer to long-distance fliers, to the birds that eat fire, here are a few birds that will risk life or wing to get what they want. \n\nHosted by: Tom Lum (he/him)\n----------\nSupport us for $8/month on Patreon and keep SciShow going!\nhttps://www.patreon.com/scishow\nOr support us directly: https://complexly.com/support\nJoin our SciShow email list to get the latest news and highlights: \nhttps://mailchi.mp/scishow/email\n----------\nHuge thanks go to the following Patreon supporters for helping us keep SciShow free for everyone forever: Toyas Dhake, Reed Spilmann, Gizmo, Garrett Galloway, Friso, DrakoEsper , Kenny Wilson, Lyndsay Brown, Jeremy Mattern, Jaap Westera, Rizwan",
