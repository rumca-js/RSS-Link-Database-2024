        "description": "Whether you\u2019re a fan of the original 2002 cult classic or a survival horror fan who missed the boat, you owe it to yourself to play The Thing: Remastered. Playable on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and Switch, The Thing: Remastered sits at a very reasonable $29.99 price point. \n\nNot only does The Thing: Remastered serve as a wonderful sequel to the original sci- fi horror film, but it also introduced several groundbreaking mechanics when it first released. The squad-based trust/fear system utilized smart AI and played on players\u2019 fears in fun ways. \n\nThough the original\u2019s implementation of those squad mechanics were rough around the edges, the remaster smooths most of them out to a satisfying degree. \n\nOf course, the visual overhaul achieved with this remaster is also worthy of accolades, all running at a smooth 144fps, no less. With brilliantly varied level design and a rich survival horror atmosphere, The Thing Remastered is the ideal way to play the beloved cult classic.",

        "description": "In our AAA console gaming bubble, the Nikki\u00a0franchise hasn't made too many waves, to the extent that many might not have even been aware of its existence. For about a decade, the\u00a0Nikki\u00a0games have been an exclusively mobile-oriented affair, which, combined with their nature as dress-up games, meant that even though the audience that they targeted has only grown larger with time, there hasn't been too much overlap with the console gaming sphere.\n\nDeveloper Infold Games' goal was to change that with\u00a0Infinity Nikki,\u00a0the fifth instalment in the series and the first to be released on PC and console- and all early indications seem to be pointing to the studio having successfully pulled it off. As we approached\u00a0Infinity Nikki's\u00a0launch at the tail end of 2024, the game was amassing increasing excitement and anticipation, and now that audiences have managed to dive in and get a taste of its offerings, it's clear that whatever it is that the game has going on has got its claws sunk deep into th",
