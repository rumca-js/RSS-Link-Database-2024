So first i brought a CF card reader, and a 2GB CF card with workbench installed on it. Also a 1MB chip ram extention. It runns Workbench perfectly, but i have to install games one by one on it, so its quite a hussle to preinstall all my beloved games. My friend suggested to me to use Amiga Game Selector. He told me to buy a SD card reader with a 16 GB sd card, and install AGS on it. When i did that, the AGS booted up, but almost all the games frozed with memory error. After some research it was suggested to me, that it might be the lack of fast ram. So i asked my friend to borrow hes 8MB fast ram extention, and i

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone,</p> <p>I’m trying to track down a game I played on Amiga 2000 when I was a kid in the early to mid 90s, but I only played it once because it scared me so much! </p> <p>It was some kind of side-scrolling shooter where the main character might have been on another planet (I think I remember the background being dark, like outer space or night). What really stuck with me was that when you died, the game would instantly show a screen with a skeleton or a skull, which freaked me out!</p> <p>The game is NOT Dune, Barbarian II, Gold of the Aztecs, Golden Axe, or Dragon’s Lair. I wish I could remember more, but as I said, it scared me so much that even though I liked the gameplay, I never touched that floppy disk again!</p> <p>If anyone has any idea what game this could be, I’d really appreciate your help! Thanks so much! :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Independent_Ad6874"> /u/Independen
