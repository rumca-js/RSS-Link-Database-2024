The love story is very sweet and good. Now the songs..... ARE AMAZING ! Another Day Of Sun wins any time of the day, then their theme, then city of stars. Now the ending message is great, with don&#39;t let your dreams get the better of yourself and how a career can ruin a relationship.

Honestly, it isn&#39;t a great movie, but it&#39;s completely watchable in a just-above-Sci-Fi-Original sort of way. I appreciated that they made a sincere attempt to make a southern gothic-flavored folk horror film, and some of the atmosphere is effectively spooky. However, the CGI is pretty bad and it&#39;s pretty clear that most of what we&#39;re seeing is fake, which drags it down. </p> <p>Despite me finding it passable enough, I&#39;m really worried that this is the future of Hellboy in live action. There are countless Hellboy stories that could be adapted into good low budget horror movies, but this franchise will probably end up like the DTV era of Hellraiser where they make a movie every few years just to retain the rights.

I think a lot of people saw the trailer and expected a sad gay romance akin to Guadagnino\u2019s work with Call Me By Your Name. There\u2019s elements of that sure, and Queer is delicate and tender in the same way as that film, but it\u2019s also totally different. After the first forty minutes it\u2019s a different beast. It\u2019s dark, at times pretty unsettling, as well as having incredibly surreal sequences that don\u2019t spoon feed the audience. A large part of the film is about drugs, which might alienate audience who didn\u2019t expect it to factor into the film. As someone who knew about William Burroughs\u2019 life, I was surprised at how much the film touched on it - it almost felt like an adaptation of his life as much as it was of the book Queer. Don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s a great film, but I reckon some might not be prepared for what a challenging film it is and the places it goes into it. I\u2019m so curious to see the general reactio",

Sue is also shocked to find the mess in the apartment that Elisabeth left behind her, so she has no recollection of Elisabeth\u2019s experiences. . So Sue is basically a clone of Elisabeth. </p> <p>But then we also see Elisabeth run into the older version of guy nurse with hand mark, and he talks to her as if he himself met her with recollection of their meeting, so in that case it\u2019s clearly not a clone. So my question is which is it? Why do Elisabeth/Sue actually do seem separate while the other guy isn\u2019t? But the bigger question is if ",
