<p>Vivaldi is on its fifth day of trying to navigate an issue that has taken down its online sync services, preventing information from being shared between machines.</p>



<p>The problem surfaced on Dec. 6, but the company hasn’t been able to resolve it. Vivaldi’s <a href="https://vivaldistatus.com/">status page</a> reports that the service has been unavailable for four straight days, though other online services — including the Vivaldi.com website, login functions, and auto updating — remain unaffected.</p>



<p>Vivaldi’s sync services work much like how users log into Windows, Microsoft Edge or Chrome. In this case, information (what sites you’ve browsed, what feeds or email you’ve read) are sent to the cloud and to other Vivaldi browsers signed in on other PCs or your phone. Without the sync support, the browser doesn’t know where you left off on anoth

<p>The fact that we all spend a lot of time online is nothing new, but internet company Cloudflare has <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/radar-2024-year-in-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared some statistics</a> regarding just <em>how much</em> everyone around the world has been surfing this year — and their figures show a huge increase in internet traffic globally.</p>



<p>Despite dips at the end of February and the end of the summer, global internet traffic surged during the final quarter. Through the end of November, total yearly traffic has increased by 17.2 percent. However, this increase isn’t evenly distributed around the world. In Guinea, for example, internet traffic grew by a whopping 350 percent in 2024.</p>

<p>In a move that’s less surprising than it is inevitable, Peacock has begun warning its subscribers that the days of carefree password sharing are coming to an end. </p>



<p>Peacock users have begun receiving emails from the streamer about impeding changes to its terms of service, and among the provisions is one aimed directly at account sharers. </p>



<p>The revised agreement says that “unless permitted by your Service Tier, you may not share your subscription outside of your household,” <a href="https://thestreamable.com/peacock-to-make-account-sharing-against-terms-of-service-starting-in-january-2025" data-type="link" data-id="https://thestreamable.com/peacock-to-make-account-sharing-against-terms-of-service-starting-in-january-2025">The Streamable reports</a>. </p>

<p>Cloud storage is great and all… until you remember that you’re paying a monthly or yearly fee that easily costs more than an SSD over time. Plus, you have to worry about data breaches, sync issues, slow transfers, etc.</p>



<p>Sometimes, a portable storage drive is just the better solution. And if you need one, here’s a great deal to jump on: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Crucial-2TB-Portable-SSD-CT2000X6SSD9/dp/B08FSNKNSV/">Crucial’s X6 portable SSD (2TB model) is now $110 on Amazon</a>, 25 percent off its usual price. It’d be a shame to miss out on so much extra storage space for your photos, videos, games, and all the rest.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394275/crucial-x6-usb-ssd-review.html">our review of the Crucial X6</a>, we gave it a near-perfect score and our Editors’ Choice award. We loved the ergonomic design and its
