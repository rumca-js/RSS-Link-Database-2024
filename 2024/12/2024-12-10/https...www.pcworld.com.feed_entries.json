Vivaldi\u2019s <a href=\"https://vivaldistatus.com/\">status page</a> reports that the service has been unavailable for four straight days, though other online services \u2014 including the Vivaldi.com website, login functions, and auto updating \u2014 remain unaffected.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vivaldi\u2019s sync services work much like how users log into Windows, Microsoft Edge or Chrome. In this case, information (what sites you\u2019ve browsed, what feeds or email you\u2019ve read) are sent to the cloud and to other Vivaldi browsers signed in on other PCs or your phone. Without the sync support, the browser doesn\u2019t know where you left off on anoth",
