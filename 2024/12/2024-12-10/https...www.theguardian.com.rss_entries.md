<p>After Jhon Durán scored, another ludicrously powerful strike within seven minutes of entering the field, he celebrated by showing the Aston Villa supporters the palms of his hands, as if to say, calm down, what else did you possibly expect? Perhaps it explains why Unai Emery, hands in the pockets of his puffer coat, was unmoved. Another substitute, Ross Barkley, ultimately earned victory, however, after Leipzig twice pegged Villa back, Lois Openda and Christoph Baumgartner cancelling out goals by John McGinn and that one from Durán.</p><p>Villa supporters crooned Emery’s name throughout and his changes proved inspired. Durán made another timely contribution and Barkley scored within two minutes of replacing Youri Tielemans. Barkley took aim from the edge of the box and his right-foot shot took a wicked deflection off the Germany defender Lukas Klostermann, wrong-footing Peter Gulacsi, to push Villa up to third. With a trip to Monaco and a home game against Celtic remaining in the

## Mohamed Salah’s penalty sinks Girona to make it six wins from six for Liverpool

<p>Liverpool’s perfect Champions League continued and a European was completed with a sixth win and a fifth clean sheet, Arne Slot’s side having now not conceded since the third minute of the opening night. They also have their goalkeeper back, and on a cold night at Montilivi those things were related. Mohamed Salah’s penalty secured a 1-0 win against Girona, but this was as much about Alisson Becker who made five saves on his return to virtually secure a place in the last 16 two matches early.</p><p>If the record is perfect, the performance was not. In the end, though, it was enough: businesslike and maybe a bit bureaucratic. The penalty that won it certainly was, handed to them by the VAR. When Girona threatened, the Brazilian helped to hold them at bay. And then, not for the first time, they secured the win in the second half, allowing them to finish top of the table and almost certainly to skip a round, that extra rest something Slot had said would be welcome.</p> <a href="https

<p>New Zealand bowler leaves Test cricket with a long list of accolades but there are doubts about his role in Hamilton</p><p>Tim Southee and Test cricket say farewell to each other this coming week and whether selected or not – a hot topic here – any guard of honour will be a deserved one. Starting and finishing against England is a neat way for his 16 years with New Zealand to come full circle, too, as is his domestic home, leafy Seddon Park in Hamilton, playing host.</p><p>Cricketers are more than just numbers but for the farm boy from Waiotira on the North Island, one of four sport-mad siblings rarely to be found indoors, they are still worth repeating. Southee sits second only to Sir Richard Hadlee for Test wickets by a New Zealander, 389 to the knight’s 431.

<p>Zombie movie action soundtracked by the unhinged vinyl screeches of Boots, Rudyard Kipling’s evocation of soldiers in battle? It’s a match made in horror movie heaven</p><p>If you’re honest with yourself, you probably weren’t all that excited about 28 Years Later when you first heard about it. After all, as entertaining as 2002’s 28 Days Later was, 2007’s 28 Weeks Later demonstrated all the signs of diminishing returns. It wasn’t as scary. It wasn’t as memorable. And it turns out that things just weren’t as interesting six months after a zombie outbreak as they were four weeks after. By rights, 28 Years Later should continue this trend. And, when it comes out, that might still prove to be the case. As of now, though, it’s just about the most exciting film of 2025. And this is entirely down to its trailer.</p><p>By now, you know the basic formula for most movie trailers. Pick any song from the last 50 years, doesn’t matter which, and record a new version of it.

<p>Voiced by Gerard Butler and Emilia Clarke, this is cosy-as-crumpets family fare, although padding out the book into an 80-minute film is a stretch</p><p>It was the night before Christmas – and as if Santa didn’t have enough on his plate, he falls down a rabbit hole. Carys Bexington and illustrator Kate Hindley’s popular kids’ book sending Santa on an adventure to Alice’s Wonderland has now been turned into a family Christmas movie. Gerard Butler stars as the big guy, with Game of Thrones’ Emilia Clarke voicing the Queen of Hearts (channelling Blackadder’s right royal meanie Elizabeth I with a bit of Peppa’s Mummy Pig). It’s all very charming: as cosy as crumpets in front of an open fire. But the film-makers are really pushing it, by stretching out the book’s 30-odd pages into 80 minutes of screen time.</p><p>Sticking with the picture-book feel, it looks gorgeous. The animation is sweetly naive yet detailed and closely observed. Santa’s present-making operation is a delight: a conv

What this meant in practice was that they made one reality show about how hard they had it, and then they stuttered. The Harry &amp; Meghan show was followed by two forgettable documentaries, one about the Invictus Games and one about some nebulous concept of leadership. At some point in the future there will be a Meghan cookery show that Netflix seems reluctant to show. But before that comes Polo, a show about polo made by Prince

 But after hours in emergency, she wasn’t getting better. The only question was whether to admit her to the pediatric ward or to transfer her to a hospital with a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU).

<p>Ambitious feature by Timm Kröger moves from lurid colour to stark black and white following an academic’s Alpine adventures in the metaverse</p><p>This twisted and twisty German feature takes the modish notion of the multiverse for a spin and sends it into a deep elliptical orbit. The result is strange and discomfiting, a bleak work of retro sci-fi noir, pristine as an Alpine mountain after a snowfall and just as crispy cold. Not all its gambits play out and it won’t be to everyone’s taste, but director Timm Kröger displays admirably reckless ambition with this very original yet oddly familiar work.</p><p>There’s certainly a lot of code-switching in genre terms going on, which contributes to the sense of familiarity but keeps undermining itself. A delicious, luridly coloured parody of a late 60s/early 70s talk show introduces main character Johannes (Jan Bülow) as the author of a “novel” (that he insists is nonfiction) about the aforementioned m-verse.

<p>A look at wrath, gluttony and the rest from a medical perspective offers valuable insights – but is disease a good guide to normal functioning? </p><p>‘From Adam has sprung one mass of sinners and godless men,” wrote St Augustine, arguably the key architect of the Christian doctrine of original sin. The notion that babies are born with this indelible stain, the residue of Adam’s fall in Eden, can seem one of the most pernicious features of Christian dogma. But as Guy Leschziner argues in Seven Deadly Sins, we could interpret Augustine’s austere judgment as an acknowledgment that we are inherently inclined to do things we shouldn’t. The catalogue of seven direst vices first adduced by Tertullian and immortalised in Dante’s Divine Comedy – pride, greed, wrath, envy, lust, gluttony and sloth – may seem arbitrary, but we can all recognise aspects of them in ourselves.</p><p>Leschziner, a consultant neurologist at Guy’s Hospital in London, explores the physiological and psychological r

There’s a cheery older gentleman working on his reading skills, and an older lady who remembers the time when their small community was ruled by a handful of male authority figures in positions of power.</p><p>These people’s stories are all gently compelling, in much the same way as they would be if you got into a conversation with any of them on the bus or in a bar. The uniting principle of the documentary is that they’re all p

<p>As a player he could always manifest greatness but the club that adored him and the game he bestrode has left him behind</p><p>Occasionally, at various opportune or triumphant moments in his career – posing for a photograph, say, or receiving a medal or trophy – Steven Gerrard has been called upon to smile. This is a challenge that has almost invariably proven beyond him. Take – by way of illustration – his famous goal against Olympiakos in the Champions League, 20 years ago last Sunday. We all remember what happens: header, ball drops, Gerrard smashes it in from distance and tears off in celebration, fists flying, teammates in pursuit.</p><p>But is he smiling? Not really! Something <em>is</em> definitely happening to his face: a sort of simultaneous compression and explosion. And clearly he prefers this state of affairs to any alternative. But you would probably characterise his expression – at one of the most memorable and satisfying moments of his career – as more of a growl, a

<p>In an extract from his new book Stephen Brenkley explains the fervour and political intrigue stirred by Australia’s tour</p><p><em>Britain in 1926 was a troubled country. Revolution was in the air as the catastrophic after-effects of the First World War continued. A General Strike in May soon ended, but it left a legacy of bitterness and recrimination. Millions of workers across many industries were sacked or locked out, and coal mining came to a standstill. Poverty was widespread, but it lived alongside plenty. Against this backdrop Australia’s cricketers arrived to defend the Ashes that they had won decisively in all three series since the war.</em></p><p><em>Cricket in England, like everything else, was still recovering after the conflict.

<p>Eye-catching thrashings have been a feature of the revamped competition, but the cause is up for debate</p><p>If Paris Saint-Germain take an early lead at Red Bull Salzburg on Tuesday they may wonder whether to stick or twist. The new Champions League format has, at least in part, been designed to ensure Europe’s superpowers have fewer opportunities to fail, so their position risks embarrassment. They will not even qualify for the playoff round in February unless they improve on 25th place and, with three league-phase games remaining, are two points and three goals shy of the cutoff.</p><p>A tight 1-0 would prise the door back open but that might not cut it in this season’s competition. Salzburg are a shadow of their former selves and it should be an invitation to rack up a big score. The majority of PSG’s rivals have done so at least once: this edition of the tournament has been hallmarked by booming scorelines and the question, in a week that promises more of them, is why.</p> <
