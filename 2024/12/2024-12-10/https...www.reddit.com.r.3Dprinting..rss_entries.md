They&#39;re just getting into a highly complex hobby that is even more difficult when you&#39;re on a tight budget (no bambu). Every time I see a simple troubleshooting issue I think &quot;Didn&#39;t you read the wiki?! Have you googled it? ....(Starts typing sarcastic answer)&quot; but then I remember I&#39;m not in <a href="/r/fitness">r/fitness</a> and I behave myself. But no one here does that either. Every time I look at the comments they are 90% the correct answer, formatted neatly, and without criticism.
