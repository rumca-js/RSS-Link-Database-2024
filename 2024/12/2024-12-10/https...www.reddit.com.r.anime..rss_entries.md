However, it&#39;s just now that I&#39;m really asking, is there a reason behind anime openings and closing being creative showpieces? </p> <p>Particularly with the closing credits, most other studios around the world are happy with slapping white words across a black screen, or at the most, a screen with a static image or design with the credits rolling over it. </p> <p>But anime studios have consistently used this as a time to be creative and still have some sort of art or animation showcase. </p> <p>Does anyone know how or why this started?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>As the name suggests it is something of a harem anime at only 13 episodes I’m happy to say genuinely one of the best ones I’ve seen so far. It follows the antics of school deviant Yoto Yokodara &amp; Tsukiko Tsusukashi after the two meet each other in truly spectacular fashion while before each making a prayer to a local statue of a stone cat that grants their wishes. The best way I can describe the premise of this series is becareful what you wish.</p> <p>What I really like about this series is both it’s wonderfully defined cast and it’s sense of humor. This may sound formulaic but there’s actually a lot of depth to these characters and their arcs and backstory, show has quite a few curveballs and emotional moments too.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Adam_The_Actor"> /u/Adam_The_Actor </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1hap1fx/so_ive_been_watching_hentai_prince_th
