Data from the now-collapsed Arecibo Observatory continues to drive major discoveries in space science. Sofia Sheikh and her team from the SETI Institute utilised archived data to investigate the signals of pulsars—dense neutron stars emitting radiation like cosmic lighthouses. Their study focused on how these signals are distorted by interstellar gas and dust, a phenomenon known as diffractive interstellar scintillation (DISS). Findings suggest that the interstellar medium may affect pulsar signals more than previously thought, pointing to the need to revise existing models of the galaxy’s structure. The research has implications for improving gravitational wave detection through pulsar timing arrays, such as the NANOGrav project. Despite Arecibo's collapse in 2020, its data remains critical for ongoing astronomical research.
