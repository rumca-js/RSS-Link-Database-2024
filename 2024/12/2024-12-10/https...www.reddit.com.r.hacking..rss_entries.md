<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all—I’m a total newbie, so forgive me if this question isn’t appropriate for this sub or if it doesn’t make sense.</p> <p>I’m not a hacker and only somewhat computer literate. I’m a student/researcher. There is a video I’d like to access, but it is located at a URL that begins with “www.ami-admin…”</p> <p>The website will not load on my personal computer. Is there any workaround the access this video on my PC for someone like me with no hacking knowledge?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/AbbreviationsLive569"> /u/AbbreviationsLive569 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1hbf81e/amiadmin_website_access/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1hbf81e/amiadmin_website_access/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>been interested in CTFs for the past few months, had some training in web and forensics, extremely fun categories, but rev and pwn sound even more fun and tricky. decided to get into reverse engineering first. i studied assembly over the past few weeks and managed to build a calculator using assembly (was a bit confusing using the registries). i believe the next step is learning how to use ghidra but time is tight and i don&#39;t want to just randomly move.</p> <p>is learning ghidra the right move or do i need other prerequisites first? </p> <p>(i know basic C/C++. I&#39;m not very educated when it comes to topics like memory management and data structures tho)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ad_396"> /u/ad_396 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1hba8g4/reverse_engineering/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1hba8g4/r

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have some software on my computer and the licence key is about to expire or be retired by the company from their side. I have all the files on computer to work but it does require internet access at startup assuming it&#39;s doing checks for some reason. For educational purposes I was thinking instead of waiting for expiration and then trying to bypass, perhaps I could save the current working state as it&#39;s own program via x64dbg?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/FINIXX"> /u/FINIXX </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1hb0fm8/software_trial_licence_about_to_expire_can_i_save/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1hb0fm8/software_trial_licence_about_to_expire_can_i_save/">[comments]</a></span>
