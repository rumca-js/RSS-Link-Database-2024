Small wind turbines, or SWTs, have low efficiencies that rarely justify their high costs. They also have to contend with the same kinds of considerations that your typical turbine does, like noise, vibration, environmental impacts, and aesthetics. In closer proximity to people, these factors are that much more important (and difficult) to nail. There’s a lot of high-speed winds in major cities, and someday soon wind turbines might be integrated seamlessly into your surroundings. How can SWTs turn windy city streets into an opportunity? When can apartment dwellers start to produce their own wind energy? And why was one SWT company inspired by a NASA rover shaped like a beach ball?
