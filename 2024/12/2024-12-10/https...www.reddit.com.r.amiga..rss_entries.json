It runns Workbench perfectly, but i have to install games one by one on it, so its quite a hussle to preinstall all my beloved games. My friend suggested to me to use Amiga Game Selector. He told me to buy a SD card reader with a 16 GB sd card, and install AGS on it. When i did that, the AGS booted up, but almost all the games frozed with memory error.

What really stuck with me was that when you died, the game would instantly show a screen with a skeleton or a skull, which freaked me out!</p> <p>The game is NOT Dune, Barbarian II, Gold of the Aztecs, Golden Axe, or Dragon\u2019s Lair. I wish I could remember more, but as I said, it scared me so much that even though I liked the gameplay, I never touched that floppy disk again!</p> <p>If anyone has any idea what game this could be, I\u2019d really appreciate your help!
