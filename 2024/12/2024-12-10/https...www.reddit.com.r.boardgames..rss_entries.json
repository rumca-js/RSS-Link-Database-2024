All conclusions from some reviews online checked briefly, but... I really hoped that I as a player can hurt another player by sending my guest to his &quot;party&quot; and this mechanic is not in the game! There is possibility to steal servants, but why I can&#39;t sent Auntie Ada to ruin evening for my lovely neighbor? If I missed this or game don&#39;t have such interaction between players?

Maybe I miss something that makes it cool... I&#39;ll be happy to be wrong, but as mentioned above I was expecting a bit different gameplay based on theme. Maybe there is something similiar that is closer to what I&#",

My friends aren\u2019t huge gamers but they\u2019re usually willing to get into some more complex games for my sake (bless em). </p> <p>Been looking at Glass road as a nice mid weight euro, but I\u2019d like to make the night more fun in addition to puzzly for their sakes. Anyone know some good euros with some party-style rules, either natively or with a house rule? Bonus if it\u2019s easily obtained on second hand market. </p> <p>Hopefully this comes across correctly lol, I found it hard to type the thought out exactly as I meant it. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Desingz\"> /u/Desingz </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1hb68ve/partyfiable_mid_weight_games/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/board",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>&quot;Sheep Happens&quot; was a Kickstarter project that, unfortunately, didn&#39;t succeed and never made it to production. Does anyone still have the print-and-play (PnP) files that the publisher originally shared? I remember meeting the developer in Modena back in 2015. A friend of mine was really excited about the game and was deeply disappointed when it didn\u2019t get produced.</p> <p>At the time, I didn\u2019t realize there were official PnP materials available, but now I can&#39;t find them anywhere. The Dropbox link that used to host the files no longer works, and I haven\u2019t been able to contact the developers.</p> <p>It would mean so much to me to print the game and gift it to my friend for Christmas. If anyone can help me find the files, I\u2019d be incredibly grateful.

I read point 7 of this subreddit and the BGG guidelines for file sharing.</p> <p>I will bring up an example. In the last few months, I played a lot of <em>The Quest for El Dorado</em>, the new edition. It was impossible to find the new edition rulebooks online, so I scanned them neatly and created a custom PDF with all the rulebooks, expansions and the Golden Temple. As I often see materials like rulebooks and similar content online, I considered sharing them, but after reading the guidelines about Intellectual Property, I stopped.</p> <p>There are tons of board games on BGG with uploaded rulebooks and shared official images. So my question is, can I somehow share the new edition rulebooks online?

I saw a hachetteboardgamesuk Instagram post about a Stomp the Plank XXL edition coming out (noted it would be end of this year, but nothing else really). A bit later on TikTok, someone was mentioning games to get kids and showed the giant Stomp the Plank XXL box while discussing the normal stomp the plank.</p> <p>The kids already love Stomp the Plank and the XXL version seems like a fun giant version of the game. The thing is - outside of these two things I can&#39;t find a single thing about this version. No BGG entry. No pre-order pages. No informatics anywhere. </p> <p>Has anyone seen this thing at a convention, gotten some flyer with information, or anything about this thing coming at some point in the future? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/BogeyBogeyBogey\"> /u/BogeyBogeyBogey </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/board",

A lot of snow in the winter. Most older Japanese houses don&#39;t have central air and have little to no insulation, so the rooms are very hot or cold depending on the season. </p> <p>I have a few bookshelves worth of books and another large bookshelf with probably 100ish board games that I&#39;ll be keeping in a spare room. We will be living in this location for the next 5 or so years (taking care of family). </p> <p>I&#39;m wondering what would be the best sort of cover to use to cover these bookshelves to protect from dust, mold, etc.? I&#39;ve kept a cloth bed sheet over some of the book shelves in this particular room for the past few years and it has seemed to work well enough (all of the books in good condition still), but since I&#39;m moving a lot more items into this room, I wanted to check if there is something recommended that",
