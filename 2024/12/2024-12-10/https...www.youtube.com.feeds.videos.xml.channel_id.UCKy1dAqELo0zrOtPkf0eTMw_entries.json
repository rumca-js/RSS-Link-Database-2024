        "description": "In today's Daily Fix:\nPath of Exile 2 developer Grinding Gear Games is addressing player concerns that the game doesn't feel rewarding enough. An upcoming update will feature changes to what loot drops from rare monsters, and the difficulty in which enemies scale. Each map will also have a minimum number of rares. Grinding Gear Games also promised to address other issues in the future. In other news, Geralt voice actor Doug Cockle apparently got in some trouble with CD Projekt RED after spilling the beans on The Witcher 4. In a previous video, Cockle claimed that Geralt will be in The Witcher 4, codenamed Polaris, but he won't be the lead. Cockle recently clarified that CDPR told him they haven't released anything about the game's story or characters, and aren't sure where Cockle got his info from. And finally, a boss rush mode is coming to Black Myth: Wukong, but be prepared for an intense challenge as some of the bosses will have new moves.\n\n#IGN #Gaming #PoE2",

Director Kenji Kamiyama\u2019s foray into the world of Middle-earth is thrilling at times, but dull at others, with a choppy animation style and a plot made up of recycled bits of more beloved films that only serve to remind you of something else you wish you were watching instead.",

Neither the MCU nor the hero shooter genre are at the glorious heights experienced by both in the past decade, but that isn\u2019t stopping Marvel Rivals from doing everything it can to be a success story today. Approachable, yet with a high skill ceiling to reach for, it's consistently a great time no matter which fan-favourite comic book character and accompanying skillset is at your fingertips. It may be following closely in the slipstream of the hero shooter games that have come before it, but by doing so Marvel Rivals has firmly placed itself in a strong position to take the crown for itself.\n\nMarvel Rivals reviewed by Simon Cardy on PS5 Pro (PlayStation 5 Pro). Marvel Rivals is also available on Xbox and PC.\n\nWhat do you think of our Marvel Rivals gameplay review and will you be checking out the new Marvel game yourself?

One group of survivors lives on a small island connected to the mainland by a single causeway. However, when one of them leaves on a mission, he discovers secrets that have mutated not only the infected but other survivors too.\n\nDirected by Danny Boyle and written by Alex Garland, 28 Years Later debuts in theaters on June 20, 2025. The film's executive producer is Cillian Murphy. It's produced by Andrew Macdonald, Peter Rice, Bernard Bellew, Danny Boyle, Alex Garland.\n\n#28YearsLater #Movies #Trailer",

        "description": "Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Rita\u2019s Rewind reviewed by Will Borger on PlayStation 5, also available on PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.\n\nMighty Morphin Power Rangers: Rita\u2019s Rewind nails the look and feel of both Power Rangers and the classic arcade games it\u2019s drawing inspiration from. While the Super Scaler levels can be a bit of a mixed bag, they sing when they work, and they\u2019re still only manageably frustrating when they don\u2019t. Everything else, though, rules \u2014 the gorgeous sprite work, bumping soundtrack, rock-solid beat \u2018em up gameplay, in-jokes for fans, and other little touches like playable in-universe arcade games. And while nostalgia will certainly enhance the experience for some, you don\u2019t have to know your Green Ranger from your Black Ranger to enjoy it. It might even give you an itch to revisit the classic games, or give the original television series a watch. You may not be able to go down to your local arcade anymore, but if Rita\u2019s Rewind is any indication, you can alway",

        "description": "Path of Exile 2 reviewed in Early Access by Travis Northup on PC.\n\nAt its early access launch, Path of Exile 2 is already shaping up to be the sequel we\u2019ve been waiting for. Everything from the refined action-RPG gameplay to the surprisingly fleshed-out endgame has seen major improvements, and the half of the story we\u2019ve got so far shows plenty of promise, even if the setting feels a little generic in the realm of dark fantasy worlds. The downsi de of playing in early access, though, is that you\u2019ll have to slog through all three acts twice to reach the endgame, the loot game still needs some major tweaking, and some mild-to-severe technical wonkiness threatens to take the wind out of your sails \u2013 but it\u2019s nothing that makes me concerned for the future of this expansive sequel. Even while we wait for 1.0, Path of Exile 2 is already a stellar way to lose dozens of hours and a clear leap forward for the series.",
