One defeat from six until now is a fine Celtic return. Dinamo never looked particularly capable of altering that record.</p><p>The first half was a scrappy, bitty affair.

Wright and a friend absconded to chase their dreams. Their great escape ended in a police cell after they slept in a field for two nights, but the breakout was enough to show Wright\u2019s father just how serious he was about wanting to dance: within the year he was apprenticed to the choreographer <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Kurt-Jooss\">Kurt Jooss</a> and at the beginning of an illustrious career.</p><p>Now 98, he has been a dancer, company director and choreographer, and there are few people who have seen the ins and outs of British ballet",

On being derisively asked if he is God, Chalamet\u2019s Dylan replies: \u201cHow many more times? <em>Yes</em>.\u201d Chalamet shows us the mysterious burden of celebrity and zeitgeist-ownership endured by a singer-songwriter who transcends John the Baptist (in the form of fatherly and sad-eyed folk mentor Pete Seeger \u2013 wonderfully played by Edward Norton) and finally has to wake up his dozing Apostles in Garden of Gethsemane with electric guitars played, in his legendary words, \u201cfuckin\u2019 loud\u201d.</p><p>",
