<p>Last month, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2518194/microsoft-is-officially-killing-windows-mail-and-calendar-by-years-end.html">Microsoft officially announced</a> the coming end of its Mail, Calendar, and People apps. If you’re still using those apps, you’ll start receiving pop-ups notifying you that end-of-support is coming up on December 31, 2024, and you’ll be urged to switch over to the new Outlook app that Microsoft is focusing on.</p>



<p>More recently, Microsoft has started pushing users in that direction even harder. According to <a href="https://www.windowslatest.com/2024/12/08/microsoft-365-enterprise-will-migrate-outlook-classic-to-new-outlook-on-windows-11/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.windowslatest.com/2024/12/08/microsoft-365-enterprise-will-migrate-outlook-classic-to-new-outlook-on-windows-11/">Windows Latest</a>, busi

<p>The best Windows Hello webcams add something your PC may lack: a quick, secure way to log in to your PC using just your face.</p>



<p>Why buy a Windows Hello webcam? Most laptops now include a webcam of some form or another, some with Windows Hello built in. Desktops don’t, however. If you share an apartment with someone else (or just want to avoid typing in your password), Microsoft’s <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2953512/hands-on-with-windows-10s-windows-hello-it-just-works.html">biometric Windows Hello system</a> uses a depth camera plus facial-recognition technology to log you in to Windows 10 or Windows 11 in a split second. And there’s more: <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2321243/im-ditching-my-passwords-and-you-should-too.html">passkeys are hot</a>, and they use Windows Hello as well.</p>

<p>Spotting a deal for hundreds off a speedy gaming laptop is always reason to celebrate, and that’s exactly the situation with <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/asus-tuf-15-6-gaming-laptop-intel-core-i7-with-16gb-memory-nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-1tb-ssd-mecha-grey/6573673.p?skuId=6573673">this Asus TUF F15 that’s $400 off</a>. Yes, you read that right. Instead of paying $1,400 per usual, you can snag it for $1,000 at Best Buy right now.</p>



<p>The highlight here is the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 GPU, which allows you to crank those graphics settings to the max and play modern 3D games at their best. The RTX 4070 may not be the latest and greatest, but it’s still an expensive one — getting an RTX 4070 laptop at this price is a true score, one that you won’t want to miss out on.</p>

<p>Microsoft seems to think Windows 11 users are clamoring for easier ways to insert emojis, as if we’re so constantly in need of quick access to emojis on a day-to-day basis that we need super shortcuts for it.</p>



<p>Well, if that describes you, Microsoft wants you to know that they’re listening and they care. In the latest Windows 11 Insiders preview (<a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2024/12/06/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-22635-4580-beta-channel/">Build 22635.4580</a>), Microsoft has added an emoji panel to the taskbar, granting immediate access to emojis no matter what you’re doing.</p>



<p>Although there’s already a keyboard shortcut for accessing the emoji panel — simply press <strong>Windows key + Period</strong> or <strong>Windows key + Semicolon</strong> — it’s clear that not everyone is aware of it. After all,

<p>If you’ve ever accidentally closed File Explorer in the middle of digging through several folders across multiple tabs, you know how annoying that can be. Well, you won’t have to worry about that anymore soon.</p>



<p>A few days ago, Microsoft released a <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2024/12/06/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-22635-4580-beta-channel/">new preview build</a> for Windows 11 Insiders on the Beta Channel (spotted by <a href="https://www.windowslatest.com/2024/12/09/windows-11-24h2-file-explorer-now-restore-tabs-on-restart-gets-other-new-features/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Windows Latest</a>), which includes several improvements.

<p>If you need Windows 11 for your PC, you have two options: <strong>Windows 11 Home</strong> and <strong>Windows 11 Professional</strong>.</p>



<p>The Pro version is (obviously) the more expensive of the two because it offers a variety of extra features. The most compelling extra is full-featured BitLocker drive encryption for securing your data, as well as an intriguing Sandbox feature for testing software, plus some other stuff.</p>



<p>But what if you’re just a regular home user? Are these additional features worth paying a bit more? Here’s what you need to consider.</p>
