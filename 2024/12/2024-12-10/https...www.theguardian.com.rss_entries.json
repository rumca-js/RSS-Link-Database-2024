And it turns out that things just weren\u2019t as interesting six months after a zombie outbreak as they were four weeks after. By rights, 28 Years Later should continue this trend.

Carys Bexington and illustrator Kate Hindley\u2019s popular kids\u2019 book sending Santa on an adventure to Alice\u2019s Wonderland has now been turned into a family Christmas movie. Gerard Butler stars as the big guy, with Game of Thrones\u2019 Emilia Clarke voicing the Queen of Hearts (channelling Blackadder\u2019s right royal meanie Elizabeth I with a bit of Peppa\u2019s Mummy Pig). It\u2019s all very charming: as cosy as crumpets in front of an open fire. But the film-makers are really pushing it, by stretching out the book\u2019s 30-odd pages into 80 minutes of screen time.</p><p>Sticking with the picture-book feel, it looks gorgeous.

But as Guy Leschziner argues in Seven Deadly Sins, we could interpret Augustine\u2019s austere judgment as an acknowledgment that we are inherently inclined to do things we shouldn\u2019t. The catalogue of seven direst vices first adduced by Tertullian and immortalised in Dante\u2019s Divine Comedy \u2013 pride, greed, wrath, envy, lust, gluttony and sloth \u2013 may seem arbitrary, but we can all recognise aspects of them in ourselves.</p><p>Leschziner, a consultant neurologist at Guy\u2019s Hospital in London, explores the physiological and psychological r",
