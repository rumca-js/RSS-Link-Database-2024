This was a good while back now, but I'm still thinking about it - I'm still thinking about that cave. The great cave at Golgotha is part of a fairly early quest. You go in to find a malfunctioning robot and then fix it - just to show you're good enough to go off on another, far more meaningful questline. Fine. But that cave! You drop in via an elevator shaft, and if you're particularly careful - or if you can't fly - you have to take it strictly one level at a time on your way down. And what's down there? Darkness. Salty water. Puddles of green goo. But also conveyor belts, stretched and tangled across the earth. Sparking machinery that can give you a nasty shock. Doors that you'll need to find the right key to unlock. The past and the future tangled together, and yet some

<img src="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/planescape-torment-screenshot.jpg?width=1920&height=1920&fit=bounds&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp" /> <p>The greatest trick that Planescape Torment pulled is disguising its verbosity - an eye-watering script of 800,000 words - by relying on, and then swiftly subverting conventions. As an immortal known as The Nameless One, you wake up on a mortuary slab with no memory of how you came to be there. Typically this would be an opportunity for exposition, a perfect moment to explain to the player, via a cast of characters, about their circumstances, while allowing them to project their own identities onto a blank slate. But then a talking, floating skull points out that your body is heavily scarred, including one tattoo on your back with instructions on discovering your past lives. And it turns out the tale behind Planescape Torment is a more personal one. It's about unravelling The Nameless One's lifetimes of history, resonant with memories, rather
