Dhillon, a prominent Republican of Indian descent, has faced criticism for past social media posts allegedly supporting pro-Khalistani views, including unverified claims of India operating \"death squads\" targeting Sikh diaspora critics. Her remarks sharply contrast Trump\u2019s efforts to strengthen ties with India and court Indian-American voters. While Trump has elevated several Indian-Americans to prominent roles, Dhillon\u2019s nomination may alienate sections of the Indian-American community, whose support for Trump grew modestly in the 2024 election, particularly among men.",
