        "description": "Data from the now-collapsed Arecibo Observatory continues to drive major discoveries in space science. Sofia Sheikh and her team from the SETI Institute utilised archived data to investigate the signals of pulsars\u2014dense neutron stars emitting radiation like cosmic lighthouses. Their study focused on how these signals are distorted by interstellar gas and dust, a phenomenon known as diffractive interstellar scintillation (DISS). Findings suggest that the interstellar medium may affect pulsar signals more than previously thought, pointing to the need to revise existing models of the galaxy\u2019s structure. The research has implications for improving gravitational wave detection through pulsar timing arrays, such as the NANOGrav project. Despite Arecibo's collapse in 2020, its data remains critical for ongoing astronomical research.",

        "description": "Using the Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) aboard ISRO\u2019s AstroSat, scientists have identified far-ultraviolet emissions from 42 novae in the Andromeda Galaxy. This marks the first detection of such emissions during their outbursts, offering new insights into the processes of stellar explosions. Four of these novae were observed in real-time as they erupted, providing a unique perspective on the build-up to these events. The study highlights the role of thermonuclear explosions in enriching galaxies with elements and reveals critical insights into accretion disks around white dwarfs. Researchers used advanced image processing to confirm the observations, shedding light on the mechanisms of stellar evolution and the dynamics of these cosmic explosions.",
