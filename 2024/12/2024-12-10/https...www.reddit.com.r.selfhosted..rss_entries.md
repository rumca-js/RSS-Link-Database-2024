<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all, I&#39;m running proxmox ve , and have been making use of the community helper scripts. I&#39;ve been using LXC over docker, because my understanding is that it&#39;s more efficient. I&#39;ve got a single VM for docker, and have portainer and dockge running and I&#39;m really liking the dockge interface. Is there something similar to manage / deploy LXCs? at this point with my skill level I&#39;m leaning towards using dockge, Docker is more supported, most apps will have examples of compose files etc. And I&#39;m finding its a simple click to update a container in dockge.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/spacefrog_feds"> /u/spacefrog_feds </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1hbftxs/management_ui_for_lxcs/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1hbftxs/management_ui_for_lxcs/">[comments]</a></span>

They got an overkill Lenovo server which is barely used with ESXi with a couple of VMs for old databases.</p> <p>My plan is to migrate to Windows Server and spin up those old VMs with vmware while I move them to the main SQL server. I will host Jellyfin for some media (like photos or videos of the business). So, any other recomendations? like for chat, or whatever services you think could be useful. My only request is that it has to have a native Windows installer. No virtual machines, no docker, no WSL2, no hypervisors. Like Jellyfin or Adguard Home which both of them has native Windows installs for the servers version.</p> <p>Thanks in advance.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/rusa-raus"> /u/rusa-raus </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.re

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi there -</p> <p>This may be a bit of an odd one, but years ago, I used to use mediatomb as a DLNA server. It was clunky, but it had one absolute killer feature - the ability to create scriptable virtual containers for browsing content. You could create intermediate folders to group artists into those beginning with abc/def/ghi, etc, or by year, or albums, etc. This was very handy with larger collections and clunky navigation devices.</p> <p>So now in 2024 (soon 2025), I am running the old SONOS hardware (with no desire to up(down?)grade), but my music library is too big for SONOS to process. My thinking was that I could spin up a DLNA server, with custom containers to aid in navigation and just stream content rather than chocking up the SONOS library.</p> <p>However, DLNA, while an open standard, is very poorly maintained. The world has moved on.</p> <p>I have a few ideas (this is really just for audio content only) -</p> <ul> <li>Resurrect mediato
