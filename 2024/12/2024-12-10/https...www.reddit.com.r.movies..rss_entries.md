Now the songs..... ARE AMAZING ! Another Day Of Sun wins any time of the day, then their theme, then city of stars. Now the ending message is great, with don&#39;t let your dreams get the better of yourself and how a career can ruin a relationship. Now this movie can be watched by anybody, bc the musical aspect doesn&#39;t ruin anything.

Robert Downey Jr., Brendan Fraser, Ke Huy Quan, Drew Barrymore, and soon probably Demi Moore and Pamela Anderson. However, what are some expectations to the rule that you know of off the top of your head?</p> <p>First one that comes to mind for me is Mickey Rourke. His acting prowess and sex-symbol status made him a promising star in the 80s. Was a notorious asshole on set who insulted producers and pretty much made things difficult for everyone. Took up boxing (which he sucked at) when his career derailed in the 90s, leaving him with tons of facial injuries that Mickey insisted on fixing with terrible plastic surgery. Then in the 2000s, Sin City and The Wrestler (the latter of which he was nominated for an Oscar for) brought him back for a while, until he later ended up doing exactly what he did before.

In an overall amazing film, this ending sequence still manages to stand out as one of the most beautiful and rememberable parts of this movie. As someone who lost a person I was in love with too young and imagined how things would’ve played out in other circumstances, I can’t watch this scene without tearing up and am sure a lot of other people can relate. Upon rewatching, I have a much greater appreciation for the eloquent and simply stunning way in which they were able to portray the complex feelings of thinking about what could’ve been, and ill-fated love. </p> <p>The w

## Hellboy: The Crooked Man is better than I expected

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a fan of Brian Taylor and I love the Hellboy character, but I expected this to be a complete disaster after it got buried during its release. Honestly, it isn&#39;t a great movie, but it&#39;s completely watchable in a just-above-Sci-Fi-Original sort of way. I appreciated that they made a sincere attempt to make a southern gothic-flavored folk horror film, and some of the atmosphere is effectively spooky. However, the CGI is pretty bad and it&#39;s pretty clear that most of what we&#39;re seeing is fake, which drags it down. </p> <p>Despite me finding it passable enough, I&#39;m really worried that this is the future of Hellboy in live action. There are countless Hellboy stories that could be adapted into good low budget horror movies, but this franchise will probably end up like the DTV era of Hellraiser where they make a movie every few years just to retain the rights. The character isn&#39;t much of a box office draw either, which is a sha

## ‘Queer’ is not really like what people expected

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I saw Queer today and it’s a fascinating film. I think a lot of people saw the trailer and expected a sad gay romance akin to Guadagnino’s work with Call Me By Your Name. There’s elements of that sure, and Queer is delicate and tender in the same way as that film, but it’s also totally different. After the first forty minutes it’s a different beast. It’s dark, at times pretty unsettling, as well as having incredibly surreal sequences that don’t spoon feed the audience. A large part of the film is about drugs, which might alienate audience who didn’t expect it to factor into the film. As someone who knew about William Burroughs’ life, I was surprised at how much the film touched on it - it almost felt like an adaptation of his life as much as it was of the book Queer. Don’t get me wrong, it’s a great film, but I reckon some might not be prepared for what a challenging film it is and the places it goes into it. I’m so curious to see the general reactio

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>If you haven’t noticed - spoiler ahead .</p> <p>So when Elisabeth (Demi) is told about substance she is advise “you are one” with your other self, so I was watching the movie as if her consciousness has been transferred into Sue, however later in the movie I realised Elisabeth has no recollection of what Sue does when she was watching the interview on tv she was shocked and livid and clearly hearing it for the first time. Sue is also shocked to find the mess in the apartment that Elisabeth left behind her, so she has no recollection of Elisabeth’s experiences. . So Sue is basically a clone of Elisabeth. </p> <p>But then we also see Elisabeth run into the older version of guy nurse with hand mark, and he talks to her as if he himself met her with recollection of their meeting, so in that case it’s clearly not a clone. So my question is which is it? Why do Elisabeth/Sue actually do seem separate while the other guy isn’t? But the bigger question is if
