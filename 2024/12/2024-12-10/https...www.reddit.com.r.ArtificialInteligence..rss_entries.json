The issue that I have are that they can&#39;t really recognize face or body structure that aren&#39;t human like.

Is such data irretrievable or how do you do it?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/SpiderUnderUrBed\"> /u/SpiderUnderUrBed </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/",
