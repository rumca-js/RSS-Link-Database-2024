<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello, I am trying to install XFCE on my raspberry pi 5 8GB, 128 GB SD card. Also will be using it headless. I tried two methods for this, </p> <p>Methods 1a: 1. Flash raspberry pi os (bookworm) lite 64 bit onto the SD card. 2. Do full upgrade. Reboot 3. Use raspi-config to setup vnc. 4. Install xfce with <code>sudo apt install xfce4 xfce4-terminal</code> 5. Reboot 6. Change the greeter to lightdm-gtk-greeter and Reboot. 7. Select the XFCE session </p> <p>Method 1b: 1-3 same as above 4. Use tasksel to install xfce 5-7 same as above</p> <p>Method 2. 1. Flash raspberry pi os (bookworm) 64 bit with desktop environment onto the SD card. 2. Do full upgrade 3. Use tassel to install xfce 4. Change the greeter and select the session.</p> <p>In all these methods xfce installs and runs fine on the initial boot. But after subsequent startups it slows down a lot ( 3-4 second lag). Any help in this is greatly appreciated.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted

## Argon One v3 Case - Raspberry Pi 5

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have the Argon One V3 case and a Raspberry Pi 5. I had installed Home Assistant OS on the Pi. I was curious however because I can&#39;t seem to install the fan control once I do this. I had found a way to add terminal, and when I run it at first it seems to work. But when you reboot the Pi from inside the Home Assistant OS, it hangs up until you manually power it off and back on. Ideally I would like it to be able to do this cycle itself. I also want the fan and temperature control to work so it doesn&#39;t get so warm. Any advice? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/GRedditD07"> /u/GRedditD07 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1hb3b8f/argon_one_v3_case_raspberry_pi_5/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1hb3b8f/argon_one_v3_case_raspberry_pi_5/">[comments]</a></span>

So I moved it to GPIO 24 and the ground below it, but when I power it through Klipper (its a slider from 0-100% speed) It doesn&#39;t spin and just makes this high pitched noise. Do I need to purchase a new fan? do I need a different fan or just different header? The fan works perfectly fine on the 5v rail but not on the GPIO. I know the GPIO is 3.3v but I&#39;ve seen and heard of other people running it on 3.3v.</p> <p>Cheers</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Additional-Shock525"> /u/Additional-Shock525 </a> <br/> <span><a hre
