<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>The Farseer trilogy comes up over and over for being amazing. But After reading Assassin’s Apprentice years ago, I had no desire to read the rest. I recently picked up Ship of Magic, Giving her another chance because dang it, she just keeps cropping up as being an amazing writer. And while yes, her world building and characters are deep. I’m also very bored. I’m 80 pages in, and she has yet to establish an actual story. It just keeps introducing new characters, over and over.</p> <p>So I’m just wondering, before I give up on this book. Does it like… go somewhere? Does it bring all the elements together at some point? Or does it just trudge along for another few hundred pages. It might just not be for me? I dunno. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/FenrisFenn"> /u/FenrisFenn </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1hbfiyb/ship_of_magic_robin_hobb_worth_it_dnf/">[link]</a>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I love the magic school/academy trope in fantasy. Harry Potter will always have a special place in my heart for introducing that to me. However, I mostly see it in YA or romantasy which can be entertaining but usually lack something in writing or substance. For example, I liked the first half of poppy war for this but ultimately didn’t connect enough with the characters and story despite its length. In the pure entertainment category, I would put first wing which has also has dragons (another favorite) so I was more willing to overlook any deficient writing or story telling. Ideally, I would like something adult fantasy not YA. The only thing I’ve read that comes close is the name of the wind. </p> <p>Are there any other adult fantasy books with academy settings? Doesn’t need any romance if the story is great like Mistborn. Other fantasy I enjoy includes the Riyria Chronicles, WoT (only on book 5 so no spoilers please!), ASOIF, His Dark Materials, Ge

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all, I am currently debating what series/standalone books to read. Below are some of the ones that have caught my attention based on what’s posted in this sub, but I welcome more recommendations. </p> <p>Just to give you a sense of what I like and read; as a child I read the chronicles of narnia a lot, and half of the hobbit. As an adult I’ve read: - Berserk - game of thrones, half of a clash of kings (great books but lost interest due to GRRM’s delay and the trash ending of the show) - a little bit of the Witcher - The Shades of magic trilogy - mistborn era 1 &amp; 2 - stormlight archive up to book 4 - one piece (fav manga if it counts)</p> <p>I do not mind complex or simple prose as long as the story, characters and setting are intriguing and moving. I enjoy dark books like berserk and A song of ice and fire, but also really love relatable mental health themes such as seen in the stormlight books. Essentially substance and soul over prose. </p>

So, I thought I&#39;d ask for author suggestions that you think do things better than Sanderson, so I can figure out the differences myself.</p> <p>For some further context, I hadn&#39;t read anything of significance in the past decade or so, ever since I finished middle school.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I came across a video questioning how a century would have its organs set up, and so I began theorizing and wanted to put it down somewhere.</p> <p>First of all the human torso: my Hypothesis is that centaurs have 4 lungs and two stomachs, but all in the human torso. Imagine of you took our lungs, copied them, turned them around and placed them behind the original lungs, voiding all organs in the way. These 4 lungs being needed for a centuars large body. While a century would also have two larger stomachs ontop of eachother in the abdomen. These two stomachs, much like a cows 4, allow centaurs to eat hay and leaves and such, but also raw meat. As human food is often somewhat pre-digested before consumption via cooking, the first stomach tackles this problems. The acid of witch having a different make up then the second, ilemenating risks of most disease and sickness that come with raw meat. The second ofcourse finishes the breaking down of said food.

The book is set in the modern day but the story itself is set all over the world and even other words at times, from what I can remember the were 4-6 other words. The main character is a fully self taught portal mage with extremely fine control over his mana. One of the key plot lines it that in the first book he helps a healer “discover” harmful healing so that she can be a fully fledged healer, however the government already knew about harmful healing and kidnapped her and brought her to one of the other worlds so that the would be trained as a soldier however the main character attempts to break her out of the black site, and in the process he floods the cite with lava.
