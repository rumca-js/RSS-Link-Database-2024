<p>Researchers from the Tokyo University of Science (TUS) have developed a method to enable large-scale AI models to selectively &#8220;forget&#8221; specific classes of data. Progress in AI has provided tools capable of revolutionising various domains, from healthcare to autonomous driving. However, as technology advances, so do its complexities and ethical considerations.&#160; The paradigm of large-scale<a class="excerpt-read-more" href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/machine-unlearning-researchers-ai-models-forget-data/" title="ReadMachine unlearning: Researchers make AI models ‘forget’ data">...
