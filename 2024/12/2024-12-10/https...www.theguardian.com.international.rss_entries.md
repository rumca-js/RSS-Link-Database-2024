<ul><li>Dutchman has won just one of nine league games</li><li>De Pauw did not take training session on Tuesday</li></ul><p>Aston Villa are considering the future of their women’s first-team manager, Robert de Pauw, the Guardian understands.<br><br>
 Following Sunday’s 4-0 defeat away at Arsenal in the Women’s Super League, the Midlands club are currently ninth in the table and one point above the relegation zone. De Pauw has overseen one victory in his first nine league fixtures in English football.</p><p><br><br>
 According to multiple sources, senior staff at the club discussed De Pauw’s position on Tuesday and it is not yet certain whether or not he will remain in charge for Wednesday’s League Cup Group E fixture at home to the Championship side Charlton Athletic. Villa are second in the group behind Tottenham and still hold a strong chance of reaching the quarter-finals ahead of Wednesday’s concluding group-stage fixtures.<br><br>
 It is also understood that De Pauw did not take

## Bellingham gives Atalanta too much to do as Real Madrid show they are back

<p>Rumours of Real Madrid’s Champions League demise had, it turns out, been exaggerated. So had suggestions Kylian Mbappé makes a poor fit for Carlo Ancelotti’s side if an emphatic opening goal is anything to go by, although his later departure with an injury means the question marks will linger. More than anything else this was a pulsating affair that swung in numerous directions and ended with the feeling these sides may meet again with more at stake. Vinícius Júnior and Jude Bellingham sealed a win that hauls Real back into contention for an automatic knockout place but Atalanta, who replied through a Charles De Ketelaere penalty and Ademola Lookman, would have deserved a point and will not feel distraught at a first defeat in two and a half months.</p><p>The makings of a league phase classic were present from the outset; it was the kind of match-up that might deal this tournament’s new iteration an extra shot of credibility.

<p>Received wisdom before kick-off at the Stadion Maksimir was that this was the ideal time to face Dinamo Zagreb. Celtic proceeded to prove this campaign is not the one in which to play them in the Champions League. While there will be a tinge of frustration from Brendan Rodgers that a draw was all that could be collected from a fixture in which they were the superior team, capitulation in Dortmund early in this campaign continues to look irregular. Celtic are again a serious team at elite level in Europe; while progression to the knockout stage could not be sealed in Zagreb, there should be every confidence of that box being ticked when Young Boys visit Glasgow in the new year. One defeat from six until now is a fine Celtic return. Dinamo never looked particularly capable of altering that record.</p><p>The first half was a scrappy, bitty affair. A poor playing surface was responsible in part for that but Celtic would have been disappointed not to make the most of umpteen promising

At 16, he was a student at Bedales boarding school in Hampshire, but was desperate to train to be a dancer, something his disapproving father had no truck with.

Their great escape ended in a police cell after they slept in a field for two nights, but the breakout was enough to show Wright’s father just how serious he was about wanting to dance: within the year he was apprenticed to the choreographer <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Kurt-Jooss">Kurt Jooss</a> and at the beginning of an illustrious career.</p><p>Now 98, he has been a dancer, company director and choreographer, and there are few people who have seen the ins and outs of British ballet

<p>James Mangold’s biopic follows the rise of the era-defining star with Chalamet brilliantly embodying his shapeshifting allure</p><p>Not Judas – Jesus. Timothée Chalamet’s hilarious and seductive portrayal of Bob Dylan makes him the smirking, scowling and unwilling leader of his generation, whose refusal to submit to the crucifixion of folk-acoustic purity is his own crucifixion. Chalamet gives us a semi-serious ordeal of someone who is part Steinbeck hero, part boyband star, part sacrificial deity. On being derisively asked if he is God, Chalamet’s Dylan replies: “How many more times? <em>Yes</em>.” Chalamet shows us the mysterious burden of celebrity and zeitgeist-ownership endured by a singer-songwriter who transcends John the Baptist (in the form of fatherly and sad-eyed folk mentor Pete Seeger – wonderfully played by Edward Norton) and finally has to wake up his dozing Apostles in Garden of Gethsemane with electric guitars played, in his legendary words, “fuckin’ loud”.</p><p>

<p>The plundering of JRR Tolkien’s source material continues with this plodding adventure turning a footnote into a film</p><p>The rationale for The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim is not in its artistry. Sure, there’s something lovely and almost tactile in this anime take on JRR Tolkien, the hand-drawn Japanese styles renovating Middle-earth to suit its tastes. That’s not justification enough to sit through a plodding and joyless spin-off, the latest in content mined from Tolkien’s books following Peter Jackson’s Rings and The Hobbit trilogies and an Amazon prequel series now in its second season.</p><p>For those already battling Tolkien fatigue, brace yourselves for a new batch of movies beginning with Andy Serkis’s The Hunt for Gollum. This is just where limitless IP plundering intersecting with the limited imagination in an industry chasing algorithms has gotten us.
