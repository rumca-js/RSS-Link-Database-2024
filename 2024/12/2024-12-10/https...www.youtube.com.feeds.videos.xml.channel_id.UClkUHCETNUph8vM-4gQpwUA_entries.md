Path of Exile 2 PATCH Incoming - MASSIVE CHANGES to Dodges, Loot and MORE!
In this Path of Exile 2 video, I'm gonna be talking about the the post that GGG released addressing the early access post-launch feedback. Some things in the game are going to be changed, namely dodge rolls, checkpoints, itemization, currency changes, and a couple more things and in this video I want to go through what's changing to the game and what have changed already.
