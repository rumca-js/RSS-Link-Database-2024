Jotunnslayer: Hordes of Hel Gameplay Preview – A Roguelike RPG That Feels Like Bullet Heaven
I was able to try out this demo of a game that caught my eye, and I had a very great time playing it. If you’re looking for something fast-paced with decent customizability and a lot of challenging content to try out, you’re in luck because, in this article, we’ll be talking about Jotunnslayer: Hordes of Hel, a game by Grindstone that lets you fight off hordes of enemies while making you feel like a complete badass. This game is slated for release on January 21, 2025 for the PC.
