<p>The Premier League season has not reached its halfway point and yet Arsenal knew this was a game they had to win. Liverpool’s stunning form at the top of the table had seen to that. It was scrappy for long spells, Ipswich digging deep, determined to show a response to the 4-0 home drubbing against Newcastle from last Saturday – the only time they have taken a real battering this season.</p><p>Arsenal were restricted. They found chances difficult to come by. But in the end, one goal was enough – together with another clean sheet for David Raya, his 23rd in 50 league appearances for the club. Kai Havertz was the scorer, turning home a Leandro Trossard cross midway through the first half; he made it look simple.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/dec/27/arsenal-ipswich-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Manchester United midfielder has been more disciplined this term but unique demands of his job keep him in line of fire</p><p>Against Leicester on Boxing Day Virgil van Dijk took to 50 the number of successive league games he has played every minute of. This alone does not explain why the Dutchman is such an effective leader, nor why his Liverpool side are currently so successful, but it certainly helps. There are many kinds of captain, many ways of leading, but above all the one unarguably necessary thing is to be present. You cannot lead a team from the stands.</p><p>At which point it is tempting to go in two-footed on Manchester United’s Bruno Fernandes, as many newspaper headlines did on Friday morning. The Portuguese is, for a couple more days at least, one of only four other captains to have played in every game of this Premier League season but that run ends with the visit of Newcastle on Monday, for which he will be suspended after Tony Harrington, just after half-time in

For those who base their spiritual practice on the seasons, the solstice is a time of ritual and reflection, of communing with the darkness of nature and the light to come. At henges and groves throughout Britain, people gathered to mark this day: wiccans, neo-pagans of all sorts, and druids.</p><p>Druids are best known as iron age ritual workers, practitioners of an earth-based spirituality found throughout what is now England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland.

Add to that the element of performance, and the worry that proving you care is measured in the messages you send … and it can all get too much.</p><p>“Where has Remona gone?” panicked one friend, when I went awol while juggling a deadline, babysitting, and hosting house guests. The pile-up of 248 unread messages in one group alone – inclusive of podcast-length voice notes – made me feel like a bad person for being absent.

<p>A lady grabbed my hand and began praying. That was the moment I thought I might be dying</p><p>I grew up in Hampshire, in the UK, in the 1980s, and still remember the terrifying fireworks <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fa1pC9aLNsQ">safety videos</a> from my childhood. They made dire warnings of death and disaster if you picked up a dropped sparkler or went back to a lit firework. Every Guy Fawkes Night, Dad made sure we watched the action from inside the house.</p><p>Here in Texas, things are different. I&nbsp;moved to the US in 2007, and each year, as the Fourth of July approached, containers would appear by the road, selling enormous fireworks to anyone, no questions asked. My American wife, Megan, was always safety-conscious. Our son was allowed a&nbsp;sparkler if he was lucky. But for our friends, you couldn’t celebrate Independence Day without huge explosions. We knew that the Fourth of July party we were invited to in 2022, on a friend’s two acres of land, would ha

 The scheduling gods have flexed their muscles and pushed another potential warm-up for the postseason into the choice late-afternoon slot. We have a late festive feast in Green Bay heading to Minnesota, in favor of a damp squib between Philadelphia and Dallas, for what could turn out to be the NFC Championship Game. The Packers are fresh from locking their playoff place with a thrashing of the Saints while the Vikings are gunning for an incredible ninth win in succession. Unfortunately for Matt LaFleur’s team they cannot reach any higher than third in the NFC North as the Lions also sit on 13-2, but this presents a perfect chance to practice playing on the road against a high-caliber rival. Minnesota meanwhile are neck and neck with Detroit for the N

<p>The Seleção had high hopes before heading to Switzerland but the ‘Battle of Berne’ quarter-final ended in a riot</p><p>The fallout from the defeat to Uruguay in the 1950 World Cup final overshadowed Brazil’s buildup to Switzerland. Some of the Brazilian press had labelled the national team “bottlers” and what many saw as their inability to perform in crunch games had become a preoccupation.</p><p>The pressure had eased a little after the <em>Seleção</em> went unbeaten on their way to clinching the Campeonato Pan-Americano in 1952 – Brazil’s first tournament win on foreign soil. But losing the deciding match to Paraguay in the Sul-Americano the following year raised more questions over the team’s temperament. Alfredo Moreira Júnior had replaced Flávio Costa as manager.

Her ex – who disappeared when she was grieving, 11 years earlier – has matched with her on a dating app and rather than running a mile, she’s swiped right. This thriller, adapted from a novel by Harlan Coben, relies heavily on such contrivances to build its narrative. It’s equal parts a twisty murder mystery and a study in trauma – as such, takes itself incredibly seriously.

<p>From golden Cornish sands to a Highland trail with beavers, our tipsters choose atmospheric walks to blow away the cobwebs</p><p>Starting with a forest climb, the ascent of Tom Gill’s tumbling waterfalls sets the scene for this breathtaking, two-hour walk to <a href="https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/visit/lake-district/tarn-hows-and-coniston/tom-gill-to-tarn-hows-walk">Tarn Hows in the Lake District</a>. At the top, you plateau to a different world, crisp and pure. Ahead, the undulating path meanders around jutting peninsulas and chilly bays, past boulder-dotted banks, bare twisted larch and islands bristling with soaring, verdant conifers.

<p>A glorious and intimate look at the run-up to the Britpop band’s big Wembley reunion, plus Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt flex their comedic muscles in a fun stuntman flick</p><p>“The less we do, the bigger we get.” As Blur prepare for, surprisingly, their first ever gig at Wembley, drummer Dave Rowntree reflects on the Britpop band’s reunion in 2023 after 10 years apart. In this <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/article/2024/jun/14/blur-to-the-end-review-sentimental-journey-for-four-likely-lads-on-their-way-to-wembley">intimate documentary</a>, cameras loiter in singer Damon Albarn’s rural Devon studio as the quartet congregate to finesse their most recent album, then follow the run-up to the big concert.
