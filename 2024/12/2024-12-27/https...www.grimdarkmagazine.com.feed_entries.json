Bleeding with intrigue, emotion, and snarky dark humour, this fangtastically fun yet bloody brutal dark fantasy will ensorcell you with its mystery and have you howling from laughter and heartache the entire way through. In a world where mortals are myth, a rebellious vampire maid, a magicless sorcerer and his rakish companion, a pompous and grieving vampire Lord, a secretive vampire countess and her enigmatic lady friend, and a deadly werewolf assassin cross paths as they stumble into a seemingly simple murder mystery investigation that unearths a dark conspiracy which turns their entire world on its head; it\u2019s not the start of a bad joke, it\u2019s the batshit crazy premise of Lightfall. Now, it might have taken me a few chapters to really sink into the narrative because of the frequent mid-chapter POV switches, but once I was in, I was IN. Crocker\u2019s bold storyte",
