<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello! I am working in a project where I need to save images and add new images everyday. Should I save the files in static and do a cron job to collect the staticfiles every single day or should I save the images as a BLOB (or something similar) in the db? I&#39;ve never worked with images in django before, so I have no clue what the best practice is. The docs say that they should be in static files, but I don&#39;t know if that is going to be a pain point in the long run in production and want to read from your experience!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/MrSolarGhost"> /u/MrSolarGhost </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/1hnq4n9/best_practice_to_save_images_in_a_django_project/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/1hnq4n9/best_practice_to_save_images_in_a_django_project/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello everyone I&#39;m starting an important project for my school and I needed to use Django in order to achieve more points in the &quot;backend development&quot; part and I wanted to ask something really important from you guys: How should I read the documentation? Let me elaborate, practically I started reading the Django documentation, to be more precise the &quot;getting started&quot; part that would&#39;ve introduce to a little development of something with the framework. But since I started studying I just used the &quot;django-admin project start&quot; command (or something like that) and I still have the default files that comes with the command, and that is because the getting started part keeps throwing at you a lot of concepts that you can&#39;t actually practice out properly, one example is the Middleware that now I know how it works but I&#39;m still too novice to even try to create my own. How I know the Middleware? That&#39;s because

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So this 3rd party API I am trying to integrate in my test/learning project is required to send it a API key via header. so I was looking how to add header data into the response.</p> <p>So one tutorial gave me this:</p> <pre><code>def auth(req): # DO AUTH RELATED STUFF data = { &#39;status&#39;: 200, &#39;message&#39;: &#39;Authenticated&#39; } res = JsonResponse(data) res[&#39;Auth-Token&#39;] = getToken(user) return res </code></pre> <p>But this function just responds with a json with status and message.
