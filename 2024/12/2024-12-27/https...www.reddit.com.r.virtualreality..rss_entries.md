<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Ok, so I own a quest 3, and wanted to have basic Body tracking without buying equipment, because rn it&#39;s too expensive. Even slime trackers rn are complicated and out of my budget. I tried pinoFBT today and it was awful. The feet trackers were one in front of the others, the avatar collapsed and twisted, and it just wasn&#39;t good. I liked steam standables and was thinking to get it when I went across the quest 3&#39;s own body tracking on Virtual Desktop that seemed even better. Any advice ? Should I buy virtual desktop? If so, where should I buy it and how does it work?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/railway_me"> /u/railway_me </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1hnrp4f/is_vd_better_than_fbe/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1hnrp4f/is_vd_better_than_fbe/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I had issues and seen some that have refunded due to similar issues, so putting a potential solution out there: Check the OpenXR runtime. Set it to Steam VR instead of Oculus.</p> <p>Background: Could not get past the screen with user data consent. Could see it on the PC screen, but it would not load in the headset. Was stuck &quot;Up next&quot;. I have a Valve Index. Tried different workarounds, including reinstalling, but nothing worked. Then I saw in Steam VR settings that the OpenXR runtime was set to Oculus. Not sure if this is highjacked any time you start the Oculus app or if it is an old setting from before when I had a Rift S. Changed it and then it started fine.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/MiqaFox"> /u/MiqaFox </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1hna8u5/metro_awakening_stuck_on_startup_potential/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Posting this here in hopes of more helpful and unbiased feedback.</p> <p>I picked up a PSVR 2 to enjoy its exclusives. But all of the games just look off. Everything looks kind of zoomed in. The scaling doesn&#39;t look right. And objects look kind of wobbly and not steady and persistent. The games look off in a way they don&#39;t in the 100+ games i&#39;ve played on other platforms and headsets. </p> <p>It&#39;s not how i&#39;m wearing it. I&#39;ve found the sweet spot and got text and details as clear as possible. And i&#39;ve tried every brightness level, fov setting, and lense distance possible. It&#39;s not a clarity issue. It looks like its how the games are being rendered, or the design of the lenses themselves.</p> <p>I tried all of the psvr 2 demos, and they all seem to have this issue (except maybe My First Gran Turismo). But even with that the cars interiors look too small and close up.</p> <p>Vegas Infinite, Song in the Smoke, Cosmonious

Even those huge omnidirectional treadmills you see for walking will not eliminate it, since walking and running are not the only movements you do in VR games. </p> <p>Is it possible that in the future we could have games that throw and spin us around in them without making us throw up?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Background-Jello-754"> /u/Background-Jello-754 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1hn45gt/potential_motion_sickness_solutions_in_the_future/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1hn45gt/potential_motion_si

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>TLDR: highly recommended based on initial few chapters.</p> <p>--------------------------</p> <p>I awaited this release eagerly and was just given it for xmas. DL took a while (it&#39;s not small) esp with power outages interrupting (stormy here) ... but last night I was finally able to take it for a spin. First impressions (after playing just 3 chapters):</p> <p><strong>Eye Candy: 5 stars.</strong> I was blown away by the opening scene (standing on a bridge in historic Venice). Lighting, architecture, textures, atmospheric perspective -- all very nicely done and this opening scene gave me one of those &quot;Wow&quot; moments that only VR can achieve. As I proceeded, the high quality of modelling and textures was consistent. This is a game with very high finish quality (and my GPU was struggling at times to render it smoothly). Beautifully detailed with an &quot;Italian Renaissance&quot; aesthetic that really works.</p> <p><strong>Mechanics: 4.5 star

The index is getting old for the price, the bigscreen beyond is way out of my price range, and I have not heard much about the Vive, so I&#39;m looking at a Quest 3 for the pcvr capabilities. </p> <p>Then again, full-body tracking looks so awesome to sparta-kick my enemies into large pits, but with the full set of trackers costing 2/3 of a headset, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be able to
