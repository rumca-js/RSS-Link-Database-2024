But I finally started last night, and I just wanted to tell someone that this is what Peak feels like. That’s really all I have to say. </p> <p>I don’t have any friends who enjoy manga or Anime, so I have no one else to talk to, or to even recommend it to. So I’m here saying it to you all. This is Peak Romance Anime. It’s fresh and unique but it scratches the same itch. I just finished Season 1, and I found my self smiling and giddy at the end of each episode. I think I’ll write a proper review once I’ve made it through Season 2. </p> <p>Anyway, that’s all I had to say for now, just wanted to get that out of my system.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Code-Coda"> /u/Code-Coda </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1hnf01q/the_dangers_in_my_heart/">[link]</a></span> &#32;

I&#39;ve had it happen in one or two anime in the past as well.</p> <p>Also just watched a bit more and after that point it seems that all of her internal dialogue is just not subtitled whatsoever and seems that it may be just all characters internal dialogue is ignored since Dante&#39;s internal dialogue in a part that&#39;s actually relatively important to the story is completely left out as well</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/McCreepyy"> /u/McCreepyy </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1hneyf8/do_some_anime_just_get_really_lazy_with_subtitlin

I know there’s a point where the childhood friend cries, but I don’t know when or why.</p> <p>I’ve tried searching my likes, saves and all that fun shtuff but I can’t find it again, so I probably didn’t save it.
