In the past I\u2019ve been casually interested in reading and literature, but I have been sort of passive in my approach. I.e. my past picks have been somewhat random \u201ccanonized\u201d books that either mildly interest me or I\u2019ve heard referenced somewhere, etc. </p> <p>How do you discover work that speaks to you personally? I want to be well read but I want to delve deeper than just the \u201ccanon\u201d, since that leaves so much new and interesting literature to be explored.</p> <p>Recommendations or just general advice on how you discover new books to read is appreciated. </p> <p>Some of my own favorite authors and books lean towards absurdist/existentialist satire. David Foster Wallace, Vonnegut, Catch-22, The Stranger, are some of my favorites. I love this type of literature but I want to get a little outside of my comfort zone. What else should I start exploring?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32;",

I want a book where they start out hating each-other and slowly get to like each-other without the weird torture aspects \ud83d\ude2d. Something similar to Twisted Hate by Ana Huang.

I also have no interest in all of the romantasy books out right now that seem very cookie cutter. I hope this doesn&#39;t offend anyone lol, just looking for a fantasy with beautiful prose or that is just easy to follow.

I have a complicated relationship with the romance genre in that only a very small handful of books that I\u2019ve read truly hit is romance books for me. (Romantic comedy by Curtis Sittenfeld and alone with you in the ether by Olivie Blake) I think the thing that these books have in common is their literary writing style that focuses less on the romance and more on the development of the characters. I was wondering if anyone has any book recommendations that are similar?
