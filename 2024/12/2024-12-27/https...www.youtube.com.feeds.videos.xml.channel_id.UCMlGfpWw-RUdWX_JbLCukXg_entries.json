But despite their fundamental importance, there are some common misconceptions about them, in particular about several of the most often used design patterns:\n\n* The modern form of the Visitor design pattern, std::variant, is often considered a replacement of virtual functions\n* The Decorator design pattern is sometimes mistaken as the Adapter design pattern\n* The Chain of Responsibility design pattern is often confused with Decorators\n* Explicit object parameters (\u201cdeducing this\u201d) is often considered as a modern, better form of CRTP\n\nIn this talk I'll shed some light on these misconceptions and explain how to properly distinguish between the different design patterns.\n---\n\nSlides: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2024/blob/main/Presentations/Design_Patterns.pd",
