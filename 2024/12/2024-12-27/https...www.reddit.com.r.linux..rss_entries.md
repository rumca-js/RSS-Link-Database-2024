The laptop has a 3G/LTE Sierra EM7345 module and I wanted to use it as a modem (WWAN). I already had a Debian installed with various files and stuff, packages installed, etc. When I go to use the WWAN connection it does not work, the interface disappears and it is not possible to connect.</p> <p>Looking at the dmesg I see some kernel errors related to “Your BIOS is broken; bad RMRR”, looking around they say that the problem is that the BIOS is outdated. Solution, update the BIOS. I go to the Lenovo site, download the bootable BIOS update CD. I put it in a USB, it doesn&#39;t boot. I look on the Internet, it doesn&#39;t boot. Solution, use a Windows installation CD, go into repair mode, launch CMD and run the BIOS updater that you can download from Lenovo, just the updater. Let&#39;s go to it. I go to the
