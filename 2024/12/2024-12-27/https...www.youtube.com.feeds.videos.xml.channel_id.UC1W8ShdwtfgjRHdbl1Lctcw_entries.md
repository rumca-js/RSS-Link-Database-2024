I colorized, restored, and designed the sound for this Panoramas of Geneva 1920 video. The scenes vividly capture a bustling city center in broad daylight, with pedestrians, streetcars, and horse-drawn carriages. This is followed by several picturesque views, including the Place St Gervais market, Quai des Moulins, Place Bel-Air, Place de la Confédération, and Place du Molard.

Video Restoration Process:
✔ FPS boosted to 60 frames per second 
✔ Image resolution boosted up to HD 
✔ Improved video sharpness and brightness 
✔ Colorized only for the ambiance (not historically accurate)
✔added sound design only for the ambiance
✔restoration:(stabilisation,denoise,cleand,deblur)
