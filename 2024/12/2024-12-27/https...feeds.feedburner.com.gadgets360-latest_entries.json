Researchers analysed 3,882 video-recorded attempts by wild chimpanzees in Bossou, Guinea, to crack open oil palm nuts. The study found that some chimps were highly skilled, cracking nuts efficiently, while others struggled, taking longer and using more strikes. The research also noted that proficiency improved with age, with no significant gender differences in skill. These findings suggest that there are measurable differences in cognitive abilities among chimpanzees in a single community",
