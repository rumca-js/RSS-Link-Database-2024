I\u2019m really only interested in a handful of games (super Mario world, donkey Kong country, Aladdin, maybe one or two others) I\u2019m looking at the original consoles and I\u2019ve found some others, an HD SNES console and a system that comes with games pre-loaded. I don\u2019t think I want one with games preloaded because my understanding is that those are the only games you can have. Can\u2019t add any and can\u2019t use the original cartridges. Am I understanding correctly that the original console and the HD console are basically the same in terms of the game cartridges you can use? What other things should I consider?

I&#39;ve been pretty lonely recently, I stopped doing in person school and am going to online. I have to wait for the next semester to really start online school so for now I do almost nothing all day. I play games sometimes (retro games duh) but it gets really lonely. I myself love love love to collect retro games. I&#39;ve been collecting for the ps1 a lot especially. I just wanna make a friend with the same interest as me. Collecting retro games is kind of a niche interest so I figured I&#39;d come here to find people. I&#39;m kinda just rambling at this point lol. What I&#39;m trying to say is that I&#39;m lonely and need a friend or two. Please don&#39;t hesitate to reach out &lt;3</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/_In_The_Background\"> /u/_In_The_Background </a> <br/> ",
