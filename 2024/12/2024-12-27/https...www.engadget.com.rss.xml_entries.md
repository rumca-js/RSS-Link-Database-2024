<p>The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is reportedly investigating Microsoft like it’s 1998. In the waning days of the Biden administration, outgoing chair Lina Khan’s probe is said to be picking up steam, according to <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.propublica.org/article/ftc-investigating-microsoft-antitrust-cloud-computing" data-original-link="https://www.propublica.org/article/ftc-investigating-microsoft-antitrust-cloud-computing"><em>ProPublica</em></a>. The FTC is particularly concerned with Microsoft’s bundling of ubiquitous <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-office-phased-out-replaced-by-microsoft-365-104748463.html">Office products</a> with cybersecurity and cloud computing services.

<p>If you've tried to use Xbox Cloud Streaming and experienced issues loading games or unexpected disconnects, you're not alone. Microsoft's game streaming services has been experiencing issues since Thursday and is still not totally back online 24 hours later.</p>
<p>Users on r/xcloud, the subreddit devoted to Xbox Cloud Gaming, have reported unusually long wait times to get a game to load, stretching a process that's supposed to be instantaneous into a 50 minute <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xcloud/comments/1hnkxb2/is_this_right/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-original-link="https://www.reddit.com/r/xcloud/comments/1hnkxb2/is_this_right/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">or longer wait</a>.

<p>The second season of the smash hit sci-fi drama <em>Severance</em> <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/severance-season-two-will-hit-apple-tv-in-january-2025-152503912.html"><ins>finally premieres on January 17</ins></a>. However, Apple just threw us a bone by dropping the first eight minutes of the season. It’s been nearly three years <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-tv-plus-severance-trailer-213716350.html"><ins>since season one completed its run</ins></a>, so this is a nice little holiday gift.</p>
<p>You can find the exclusive preview on the Apple TV+ app under the Bonus Content section of the <em>Severance</em> page. There will be no spoilers here, but the snippet does get into the fallout of the events of season one and may even touch on that surprising cliffhanger.</p>

## In 2024, using social media felt worse than ever

<p>It’s never been more exhausting to be online than in 2024. While it’s been clear for some time that monetization has shifted social media into a different beast, this year in particular felt like a tipping point. Faced with the endless streams of content that’s formulated to trap viewers’ gazes, shoppable ads at every turn, AI and the unrelenting opinions of strangers, it struck me recently that despite my habitual use of these apps, I’m not actually having fun on any of them anymore.</p>
<p>Take Instagram. I open the app and I’m greeted by an ad for bidets. I start scrolling. Between each of the first three posts at the top of my feed is a different ad: lingerie, squat-friendly jorts, shoes from a brand selling items that appear to be dropshipped from AliExpress at a markup. Then, thankfully, two memes back to back. I fire off the funny one to five of my friends in a way that feels obligatory. After that, another ad, then a bunch of seemingly off-target Reels from accounts I don’

In a <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://openai.com/index/why-our-structure-must-evolve-to-advance-our-mission/">blog post</a> penned by its board of directors, OpenAI said Thursday it plans to transform its for-profit arm into a Public Benefit Corporation sometime in 2025. PBCs or B Corps are for-profit organizations that attempt to balance the interests of their stakeholders while making a positive impact on society.</p>
<p>“As we enter 2025, we will have to become more than a lab and a startup — we have to become an enduring company,” OpenAI said, adding that many of its competitors are registered as PBCs, including <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.anthropic.com/company">Anthropic</a> and even

<p>Gather ‘round and let me tell you a story about the dark sky that makes mid-afternoon feel like midnight, and the light source that makes it at all bearable. Once a year, winter appears with a quick chill of the ears and sudden craving for a vat of hot chocolate. It brings all things beautiful: holiday lights, white blankets of snow in the park and thoughtful gifts. But it also invites in the cold and heaping amounts of darkness. I came of age in upstate New York, where sunlight is gone by half past four in the afternoon the entirety of December and January. That’s to say this isn’t a new phenomenon for me, but that hasn’t made it any less painful. In fact, it has caused a feeling of dread that starts popping up come late September.</p> 
<p>But when I moved to Scotland, 4:30PM became nearly 3PM and the sun didn’t fully rise until well after I’d woken up. Even in London where I’m now based, it’s easily dark by 4PM on the shortest days. Like most people, the darkness leaves me exhau

<p>It’s that quiet, end-of-December period for tech news. Still, alongside our usual retrospectives on tech in 2024, the Russian government is cracking down crypto, and final seasons of hit Netflix phenomena are on their way.</p>
<p>First, according to reports by the state-owned news agency Tass, the Russian government <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/russia-bans-crypto-mining-in-multiple-regions-citing-energy-concerns-163102174.html">banned</a> crypto mining in ten regions for six years. Russia has cited the industry’s high power consumption rates as the primary reason behind the ban. Crypto mining operations already account for nearly 2.5 percent of US energy use. The Russian ban takes effect on January 1 and lasts until March 15, 2031. The currency has only been fully legal in Russia since November.</p>
