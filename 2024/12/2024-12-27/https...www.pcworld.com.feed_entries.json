Then I have a suggestion: Build your own router/firewall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a router running a more advanced operating system on more powerful hardware than standard consumer routers, a whole world of new possibilities opens up. Although there is a learning curve and can feel complicated at first, it actually becomes easier to do things that might be possible with a router from, for example, Asus, but are really complicated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a number of operating systems to choose from, from Openwrt, which can also be installed on consumer routers, to various Linux-based systems such as Clear OS and IP Fire, to Unix systems such as PF Sense and Opnsense.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure data-wp-context='{\"uploadedSrc\":false",
