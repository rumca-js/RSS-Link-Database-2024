Deep down, you still come to life when the bassline kicks in. But you morph from hardened raver to the kind of person who\u2019s always up for dancing at parties and weddings, and then finally into the kind of person whose friends aren\u2019t getting married any more and who spends their Saturday nights giving their children lifts to parties.
