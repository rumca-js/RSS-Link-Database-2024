At this point, South Park is an institution.  By far one of the most successfull animated shows ever put on television, South Park has maintained a level of relevancy far beyond any of it's competitors.   Shows like The Simpsons, Family Guy, and Futurama all spend months cracking stories, and animating each episode.  South Park stays ahead of the curve with their 6 Days to Air turnaround, allowing creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker to follow up on real world events almost in real time.  It's no wonder after almost 3 decades, South Park is still one of the biggest shows on television.
