Now it&#39;s first day or so after re-installing. </p> <p>I searched here and found someone who wrote a batch file to prevent revit from phoning home with his pirate cutlass patch.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>As some/most of you may know that after Cricket 24 was cracked by cracking team, the game developers added additional triggers hidden within the game that have since not been disabled. As a result, once it establishes that the game is pirated, the game has been confirmed to ping back and download stealth updates.</p> <p>This allows a variety of things to occur that are not in the original programming of the game and make the game almost unplayable (batted balls going 0m, pitch rotation, auto-forfeiting, eternal abnormal weather patterns etc). As far as I know, there has been no fix for the issue till date.</p> <p>What I was wondering that if fiddler can be used to stop the game from downloading stealth updates. Fiddler was useful for preventing Cricket 22 from contacting servers for login checks, so why not Cricket 24? Maybe a noob question, but so wanted to play Cricket 24 and was wondering if anyone had any clue as to if there ever will be a fix fo

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Piracy has obviously existed since the internet was existed, although no matter what it more than likely would come to existence. Today, there is plenty of ways to pirate things, such as movies, books, games, etc., and as said, they&#39;ve always been like that. Unlike the past, you can&#39;t really &quot;own&quot; games anymore, and as such, you can&#39;t really do anything with the game you purchased the license for. Previously, when buying was owning, you could do really anything with the game, which would obviously lead to piracy, but so does games today, but without DRM. Onto my next point, a DRM makes games run worse, and instead of still having a DRM-free version on a site like GOG, they just upload to distributers that they can have the DRM (think Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League.) Ubisoft has proven that sometimes piracy can be justified (think The Crew, or Rocksmith 2014 before the re-release.) I&#39;m not saying piracy is in any way
