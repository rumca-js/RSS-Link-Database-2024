She showed a bit of interest and the lovely staff offered her to assemble and paint her first ever mini.

I have more so I thought he could have it but I didn&#39;t thought about it very well.</p> <p>Because he&#39;s a kid.</p> <p>And he already broke some of my minis (not complaining, the kid doesn&#39;t know best). But now I&#39;m a bit concerned about his safety (the glue fumes, the painting could be spilled, he could hurt himself with the cutting materials...).</p> <p>Is there some kind of starter pack for kids?
