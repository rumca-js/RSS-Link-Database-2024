<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>My wife is convinced we recently watched a movie about zombies that had a lot of mentions of pizza and where the main characters really wanted to go to a specific pizza place. I cannot remember this for the life of me. Does anyone know which movie this could be?</p> <p>I know we recently watched World War Z, but I cannot connect this movie to pizza’s. Shaun of the Dead was not a recent watch, so is not it either.</p> <p>I am completely lost. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Celinevaa"> /u/Celinevaa </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hnr6cm/zombie_movie_and_pizza/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hnr6cm/zombie_movie_and_pizza/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>In the days of Yore, before internet porn and Instagram thots, the erotic thriller held a special place in American pop culture. </p> <p>Movies like Basic Instinct or Fatal Attraction in the 80&#39;s, Wild Things or Poison Ivy in the 90&#39;s pushed boundaries and tantalized viewers. They were scandalous enough that you might be quiet about watching them in the theater, but not graphic enough to be in &quot;that section&quot; at your local video rental store.</p> <p>However, I feel like these movies are all but long gone both in terms of the number they are produced in and in what they portray on screen.</p> <p>For example, Babygirl released this week. I won&#39;t give any spoilers, but a lot of the reviews and comments seem to be on how for as much sex as is in the movie, it isn&#39;t really erotic. Nor is the &quot;mystery&quot; aspect all that thrilling.</p> <p>Similarly, Miller&#39;s Girl released earlier this year with Jenna Ortega at the height

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>TL:DR - While I do think the movie is good, I don’t see how many rank it as one of the greatest movies of all time. Can someone help me understand or change my mind? </p> <p>Over the years I’ve heard constant praise for this film. Wikipedia has many quotes from people saying that this is one of the greatest films of all time or even the second greatest of all time right behind Citizen Kane. I just watched it for the first time today and while many shots of the film are beautiful, Robert Mitchum is terrific as a devil incarnate, and the main story is intriguing, I find it hard to see it as “one of the greatest movies of all time”. </p> <p>I did enjoy the movie and think it is great, but with so many incredible films out there, whether new or old, I fail to see how this is a cut above the rest. I just rewatched Citizen Kane and that is an unbelievable film. The actors are all amazing, the aging makeup is excellent, Gregg Toland’s cinematography is perf

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Ok so... I (17) made a bet with my dad (old) to make him cry within 3 movies. It all started when I showed him and my mom a movie that came out a while ago, Look Back. Both my mom and I cried over it, but he didn&#39;t shed a tear, which got me thinking... I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen him cry during a movie like EVER... Don&#39;t get me wrong he still liked the movie and said it DID &quot;move him&quot;, I just need something to push him over the edge of tears, yk? What he told me It&#39;s apparently honest stories about strong friendships or true love that make him cry, also nothing like purposeful tearjerker (ex: Titanic). Any recommendations? He doesn&#39;t discriminate, so can be pretty much anything.</p> <p>Btw he cried over Futurama, to be exact the part where Leela and Fry read their future together, but that&#39;s like the only example I have...</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/sdfddfda

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>For years I had this weird pre determined idea that a movie has to be better than 7.5/10 rating on IMDB for it to be atleast decent. I don&#39;t know why this was the case, but anything below that I usually didn&#39;t bother to watch. </p> <p>In the last year I have been starting to slowly realise how bad of a metric that is. For example, Annihilation is 6.8/10 on IMDB and for years I put it off because of this exact stupid reason, it didn&#39;t met the quota of 7.5. After my friend nagged me multiple times to watch it, I finally gave in and oh my god that movie is amazing. There was particulary one scene that blew me away and immediately after watching the movie I started thinking of how many good movies I missed because of some stupid random metric I followed for years.</p> <p>So my question is, are there any other movies that have under 7/10 rating on IMDB but are actually really good movies?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a hr

Sam Neil and Nicole Kidman play a married couple who&#39;ve gone through the trauma of losing their child in an accident and are dealing with it by going on a vacation on their Ocean on the Pacific. Mid-travel, they find an abandoned boat with one survivor who rows himself to their Yach for help, but when the husband decides to go to the stranger&#39;s sinking schooner to see what is in there, he&#39;s confronted with a horrifying, shocking truth, which causes the separation of the couple and puts their lives in danger. </p> <p>&quot;Dead Calm&quot; was a disturbing, tense and suspenseful film. Both leads experience a different kind of danger, the husband is trapped on a sinking boat that is quickly submering, leaving him into MacGyver move, whereas the wife is trapped in the Yacht with a psycho and she&#39;s forced to do everything she can to stay alive. As the movie progresses, the film becomes more about the wife and Kidman mana

## Clint Eastwood's "High Plains Drifter" and "Pale Rider" make for an interesting double-bill, not just because they're both excellent Westerns that Eastwood directed as well as starred in, but because of the supernatural element they share with each other.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Both films have the same basic premise; Eastwood portraying a mysterious, nameless gunslinger (dubbed &quot;The Stranger&quot; in &quot;Drifter&quot; and &quot;Preacher&quot; in &quot;Rider&quot;) who rides into an isolated community with a hidden agenda and gets involved in violent antics. But what they also share is the implication that both the Stranger and Preacher are not even human, but supernatural revenants back from the grave for retribution. Eastwood himself has especially liked this aspect and played it up since both films&#39; releases (he even called Preacher an &quot;out and out ghost&quot;) and it gives what would have been straight-forward Westerns an air of eeriness and dark fantasy (especially &quot;Drifter&quot;, which often comes off like a horror movie).</p> <p>Of course, there&#39;s a lot of difference as well, since Preacher is a truly heroic figure (as expected give how much &quot;Rider&quot; owes to &quot;Shane&quot;) while t

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>A simple question, but I saw this mentioned on TikTok and it made me curious what the popular consensus is: who do you think is the best or most talented actor who keeps making terrible movies? Who badly needs to fire their agent? Hit me with those luckless saps that can&#39;t pick a project to save their lives.</p> <p>Interestingly, the main one in the TikTok was Chris Hemsworth, which I don&#39;t particularly agree with - though I don&#39;t think he&#39;s a bad actor - but I guess outside of his Marvel projects he has been in largely pretty mediocre movies with the exception of Bad Times at the El Royale, Star Trek (which he was barely in), and Furiosa, which I still haven&#39;t seen but heard was good.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/JokerDeSilva10"> /u/JokerDeSilva10 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hn8kas/who_is_the_best_actor_with_the_worst_filmography/">[

I remember as a kid going to October Sky for free as some promotion the theater had and man, it was such a good movie.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not looking for sympathy, but My dad passed away in November. He was my best friend and one of the things we used to bond over was the Lord Of The Rings trilogy. We both were huge fans of those movies and we had so much fun watching them together. So these movies also remind me of my awesome dad. But even today, over 23 years since the First LOTR movie came out, I&#39;m still so impressed with how perfect these movies are. The casting, the music, the special effects, the creatures, the dialog, the acting etc etc. I&#39;m geeking out but I can go on and on. These movies are something special. They are masterpieces. I mean I enjoy the old Star Wars movies but in my opinion, they just don&#39;t compare to the gorgeous LOTR movies. The LOTR movies are definitely the best fantasy movies ever made, and I would say the best Trilogy ever made, though the Back To The Future trilogy was nearly tied as the best. I only give an Edge to LOTR because of th
