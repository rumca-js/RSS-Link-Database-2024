<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey all, I have a question. I&#39;m curious about the various methods of playing music, particularly the older ones, because I&#39;m a Zoomer and it seems to me like the &quot;best&quot; or at least most convenient way to play music is obviously with a device that lets you play said music via an electronic file, such as a smartphone, computer or even something like an iPod or MP3 player. However, many people, including people that are roughly my age, prefer to use older, seemingly less convenient methods, and I&#39;m just wondering what exactly the appeal of things such as records, cassette tapes, and CDs are, and why someone might prefer to use them over more modern methods. </p> <p>Note: I am severely hearing-impaired and rely on implants to hear anything quieter than a close range gunshot so if there&#39;s a difference in sound it&#39;s kinda lost on me and I haven&#39;t really ever noticed one. </p> <p>Thank you for any feedback you might have. <

It’s not very comfortable for long periods of time and no noise canceling which is a bummer. Anyway, i came here to ask if I should get the Beats Studio pros? I looked online and as of now they are on sale for 170, and they seem to have everything I want. Noise canceling, more comfort due to them being over eat headphones, and apparently improved battery charging speeds and improved sound quality. TLDR; should I buy the Beats Studio pros? Or is there another pair of headphones from a different brand I should get?

To give you a feel for the vibe, Landslide by Fleetwood Mac is the father daughter song, Harvest Moon my Neil Young is the first dance, and we have more than a few Grateful Dead songs for the wedding party. We have a live Jazz band playing so if you think an instrumental version is really good, we can do it! I’m looking for something with this vibe but also sweet/sad/soulful.
