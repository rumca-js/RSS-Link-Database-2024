## CM3(+) Module won't flash but boots, will re-flashing the firmware fix and how do I do that if so?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have 2 Rasberry Pi computer modules; one CM3 and one CM3+ that won&#39;t flash using the usbtool/rpiboot utility. Other compute modules are booting and flashing to the EMC storage just fine. These compute modules even boot the last OS they had installed, so I&#39;m guessing they&#39;re fully function and I see no signs of damage to the pins on the PCB.</p> <p>My best guess is I need to re-flash the firmware on the compute modules themselves so they can go into flashing mode, but that&#39;s just a guess. Any tips on reflashing the firmware or other advice on what may actually be the root cause? Thanks in advance for any tips!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/DerryDoberman"> /u/DerryDoberman </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1hnlhfq/cm3_module_wont_flash_but_boots_will_reflashing/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/c
