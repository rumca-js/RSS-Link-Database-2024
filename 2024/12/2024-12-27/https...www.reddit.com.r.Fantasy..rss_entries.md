<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I‚Äôm fairly new to reading but really enjoy the fantasy genre as a whole. After doing some research on what series to read, I picked Malazan. I just finished the first book (GotM) and I didn‚Äôt enjoy the style as much as I was hoping. It‚Äôs truly a chore to read. Having to constantly refer to the wiki and reread didn‚Äôt do it for me. Overall, I liked the insane scope of Malazan and would like to return to it in the future. I‚Äôm looking for something a little more straightforward and relaxing to read. I‚Äôve heard Stormlight Archive is a great series that holds your hand a little more while also incorporating all the great elements of the fantasy genre. Can anyone confirm or deny?

Why did nobody think to sink the dragon in no man&#39;s land earlier as they were sinking untold amounts of dragon bone all over that nobody was going to come get out there anyway? The &#39;Trope?&#39; of a band of prisoners, some sick and violent coming together over a little bit of leadership rather quickly, all smiling and clapping, that bothered me throughout. That said, the second book hooked me within ten pages, and I devoured the rest, and I personally didn&#39;t see the end coming and loved it.

For the longest time, I <em>felt</em> like it was spec fic, but couldn&#39;t put my finger on any specific element, and I&#39;m predisposed to feel like something is spec fic.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Feel free to rank whatever you like; for my own part, I am only ranking novels I either read or listened to in audiobook form because if I included comic books and short stories this list would be way too long for anyone to read and way too hard for me to decide the order of.

## I'm looking for a book where the protagonist is uniquely powerful.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Pretty basic ask, really. But I&#39;m genuinely struggling to find recommendations for this. It seems that many authors think that &quot;special protagonists&quot; are cliche, and thereby avoid them‚Äîmaking special characters somewhat hard for me to come by. </p> <p>I&#39;m really just looking for a book where the protagonist is interebtly unique in some way (smart, magic, etcetera). In particular, I&#39;m looking for a story in which the protagonist is born with something special about them, that gives them an advantage over others. </p> <p>I dislike young adult fiction, and I do not like Brandon Sanderson (no shade to him or his fans, just not my thing). I just want a character driven story. I prefer it if the protagonist is male. </p> <p>For me, a character driven narrative focuses on a small set of characters, and it doesn&#39;t expound much on the setting. So for instance, I want a story about a magic user, not a story about a magic society. </p>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I would say that Legacy ok Kain saga has one of the best stories of the gaming history. The Raziel origin and his quest solving Nosgoth misteries, the Kain conflict with the pillars, the time travels, the war between the vampires and the hyldens... </p> <p>And in the second place, I would say Elden Ring. Maybe the main quest here is not the best one (basically defeating the bad guys and claiming the throne) but the worldbuilding, all the Gods and demigods conflicts, the story the relations and treasons among them, the conflict between the golden order and the moon... I have completed several times and when I tried to go deeper into the lore, more I think that is really really good quality.</p> <p>Which ones would be yours?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/RazielTheVampire"> /u/RazielTheVampire </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1hn2aob/fantasy_videogames_with_the_b
