She has seen things I’ve painted before and always asked about the process and what the game was called, so it wasn’t like I walked her into the wolf’s den out of nowhere. She showed a bit of interest and the lovely staff offered her to assemble and paint her first ever mini. They gave her a choice between a SCE and a Space Marine and she went for the Stormcast. </p> <p>We’re painting it together on Sunday. Assuming she likes it, where would you go from here?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Heya! I have a bit of a problem here. I maybe started a spark in a child&#39;s eye with Warhammer and he seems to LOVE it. It&#39;s a 7 year old kid and he seems interested in building a tech priest and painting it. I have more so I thought he could have it but I didn&#39;t thought about it very well.</p> <p>Because he&#39;s a kid.</p> <p>And he already broke some of my minis (not complaining, the kid doesn&#39;t know best). But now I&#39;m a bit concerned about his safety (the glue fumes, the painting could be spilled, he could hurt himself with the cutting materials...).</p> <p>Is there some kind of starter pack for kids? Any other thing like that but safe for a 7 year old kid who wants to start in the hobby. If it&#39;s not Warhammer but implies building and painting it&#39;s okay.</p> <p>Thanks in advance! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Leirmber"> /u/Leirmber </a> <br/> <span><a href="https
