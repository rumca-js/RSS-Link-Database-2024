<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I have been implementing playwright into my scrapy spider for scrolling and clicking buttons<br/> when i use it in the parse function i can&#39;t scrape the response anymore as it won&#39;t include new data from clicking the button, i have to use response.meta[&quot;playwright_page&quot;]<br/> problem is that method is taking insanely longer then just using response.css , like 4 or 5 elements / min.<br/> Am I doing something wrong? and how do i fix that problem</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/its_Creed"> /u/its_Creed </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1hnpn8o/scrapy_playwright_is_too_slow/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1hnpn8o/scrapy_playwright_is_too_slow/">[comments]</a></span>
