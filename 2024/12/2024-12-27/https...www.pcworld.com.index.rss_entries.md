<p>4K resolution is now within reach of everyday PC users, promising a massive improvement to image quality, with four times the pixels of a 1080p display.  A 4K monitor is useful not only in games and movies but also when editing documents or browsing web pages. The extra pixels make text look clear and crisp.</p>



<p>After extensive testing, I’ve determined that the recommendations listed below are the best 4K monitors available today, covering a variety of budgets and use cases. </p>

<p>Good news, everyone: My bar mitzvah videos from the mid-1990s are now digitized for the ages.</p>



<p>While I have no intention of actually watching them — <em>oy, the embarrassment</em> — I recently received the original tapes from my parents and felt like they were worth preserving in a more enduring form than VHS. I was able to do it for cheap thanks to my USB capture card, which I originally bought to take screenshots of streaming devices for my <a href="https://www.techhive.com/blogs/cord-cutter-confidential">TechHive column on cord cutting</a> but which continues to have all kinds of other neat uses.</p>



<p>Below, I’ll walk through how to digitize your own VHS tapes or camcorder footage using the same methods, plus a few extra tricks that might make a USB capture card worth considering.</p>

<p>Even for me, someone who’s an avid graphics card hardware enthusiast, it took some time to warm up to the idea of AI rdesolution upscaling.</p>



<p>But this newfangled technology has been embraced over the past few years by virtually every major GPU manufacturer, with Nvidia leading the pack with DLSS and others following in its wake, including AMD with FSR, Intel with XeSS, and even Sony with PSSR on the PlayStation 5 Pro.</p>



<p>And I’m now ready to say it: real-time AI upscaling tech has made native resolution graphics obsolete in gaming. Keep reading to learn what AI upscaling is, why it’s revolutionary, and what it means for all the new games you’ll be playing in the future.</p>

<p>It’s fashionable these days to complain about the state of streaming, and for understandable reasons.</p>



<p>Over the past year, many streaming services have raised prices or <a href="https://www.techhive.com/article/2190859/amazon-prime-video-with-ads-pricing-and-release-date.html">introduced commercials</a>, and some are trying to <a href="https://www.techhive.com/article/2229732/disney-plus-password-sharing-crackdown-cost.html">stop folks from sharing passwords</a>, even among close family members. Streaming devices have <a href="https://www.techhive.com/article/2040483/streaming-devices-have-peaked.html">stagnated</a> as well, with device makers focusing less on innovative ideas and more on <a href="https://www.techhive.com/article/2123287/fire-tv-banner-ads-are-about-to-get-worse.html">finding new spots for advertising</a>.</p>

<p>Microsoft’s best and worst of 2024, not surprisingly, centered around AI. When Microsoft was trying to force Copilot upon us, it didn’t go so well. But when it used AI to enhance what was already working, the results were much more successful.</p>



<p>For the last few years (<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/559637/microsofts-wins-fails-and-wtf-moments-of-2021.html">2021</a>, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1433015/microsofts-wins-fails-and-wtf-moments-of-2022.html">2022</a>, and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2168757/microsofts-wins-fails-and-wtf-moments-of-2023.html">2023</a>) we’ve recapped what I call Microsoft’s wins, fails, and WTF moments: Microsoft’s highs, lows, and the moments where you wondered what in the world that this company was up to.</p>
