So, I&#39;ve caught a spoiler for the entire Bill Hodges trilogy. </p> <p>This book is the first modern (well, like) Stephen King book that I&#39;ve read. </p> <p>In the story, the police arrest Terry Maitland for the brutal murder of a six-year-old boy. It would seem that all the evidence points to him, but there is one catch. Terry was out of town at the time of the murder. Probably someone wants to frame him, or something. </p> <p>The book can be divided into two halves. In the first, the main characters of the police are trying to prove the guilt of Terry Maitland, in the second, all the main characters are already trying to catch the real culprit. Both halves are made exciting. In the first, the reader already knows that Terry is innocent, which makes it tense to watch what is happening. The second one is a regular monster hunt, whe

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I finished A Storm of Swords last week and it may be one of the best books I&#39;ve read in a long time (certainly the best fantasy book I&#39;ve read since LOTR). The book encompasses so many major events it is insane. From the weddings to Jon Snow become the Lord Commander to Tyrion&#39;s escape. Imo though what makes this book special is how it balances out the fast paced action with excellent character development.</p> <p>Jaime Lannister certainly has one of the best character arcs in all of fantasy. His chapters after loosing his hand are a work of art. The reader gets a constant glimpse of his inner turmoil, his guilt and his desire to be a better person. The steam room scene with Brienne, his dream where his family and friends forsake him leaving him for the darkness. I also loved the fact that no hero here is purely white be it Jon Snow or Melisandre who is ready to sacrifice people to save humanity a noble cause but at what cost.</p> <p>Ther

It’s good but it didn’t move me the way the great books of other genres have.

They’re stories that make you think, they might not be your typical action packed sci-fi adventure but instead they’re books that make you think about what you’ve read long after you finish them.

These people in the book I’m reading just rode from their stronghold to the capital city in 50 minutes. They passed forests, a village and hills with scattered valleys with streams crisscrossing them. All that in less than four miles.</p> <p>This usually throws me right out of the story as I start figuring how far apart things are and if you can see the capital city from your castle.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>&quot;Romantasy&quot; has seen a push lately with many labelled &quot;New Adult&quot; to appeal to the 18-25 demographic yet, the books seem to attract more 30+ millenial/GenX/baby boomer women instead (ACOTAR/ fourth wing etc.) </p> <p>It has come to the point AI &quot;artists&quot; on Instagram have profitably created pages generating &quot;art&quot; of men from these books and charging people to subscribe to their Patreon to view &quot;NSFW&quot; versions of said men. </p> <p>Why is that?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I read ACOTAR a few years ago and Crescent City when the most recent book came out and thought they were alright, so when my friend suggested I read her favorite series from the same author, I figured why not. Now, I was very explicitly told not to look online for any information regarding the books until I&#39;d read the entire series, so when I finished the last book a few days ago one of the first things I did was get online and start looking up all the fanart and memes I&#39;d so wanted to see while reading. And the most common sentiment I&#39;ve seen? People sobbing over various parts of the series, talking about how emotional certain scenes were, and losing their minds over how many feelings the series invoked in them.</p> <p>Now, I didn&#39;t dislike these books. I thought they were a pretty fun read (except for Tower of Dawn, but we won&#39;t get into that) and I rated most of the books a 4/5. That being said, I didn&#39;t cry once. None of t
