<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Ontem instalei RDR2 com a fitgirl repacks. Foram 10 horas sofridas de instalação, e após terminar, ocorreram muitos erros. Ao abrir com o Launcher.exe ele aparecia &quot;Unknown Error FFFFFFFF&quot;, ao abrir pelo Launcher_with_cracktro.exe ele aparecia aquele Razor1911 Cracktro 2024 do RDR2, e por último, se eu tentasse abrir com o RDR2.exe aparecia que eu tinha que abrir com o launcher da rockstar. Aí eu tentei um monte de possibilidades até aparecer outro erro, que ao tentar abrir qualquer um dos 3 arquivos aparecia: &quot;O aplicativo não pôde ser inicializado corretamente (0xo0000142).&quot;. E então fui verificar os arquivos do jogo com o QuickSFV e para a minha surpresa, apareceu que tinham 40 arquivos corrompidos e 4 arquivos faltando. Sendo eles:</p> <p>ARQUIVOS CORROMPIDOS:</p> <p>..\x64\dlcpacks\dlc_content_extra\dlc.rpf</p> <p>..\x64\dlcpacks\mp001\dlc.rpf</p> <p>..\x64\dlcpacks\mp003\dlc.rpf</p> <p>..\x64\dlcpacks\mp004\dlc.rpf</p> <p>..
