Yes, no parity, whatsoever, but for experimenting, it was fine to me. </p> <p>Now that I want to go a little deeper into the rabbit hole, I talked to my girlfriend, what Services she wants running on the homeserver. We figured out that we want Home Assistant, OpenProject, Paperless, Adguard, Plex (or jellyfin), nextcloud and some more running on it. Then she\u2018s quite into experimenting with local LLMs, for now she needs to reboot her PC in linux (not into VMs on her machine), so she has a 4060ti 16GB for the LLMs. </p> <p>This brings up the question to what hardware to go with.

Now many people talk about HexOS which is essentially a layer on top of truenas which provides a simpler management and some automated docker deployments. It costs 199$ and will eventually rise to 299$ after the beta.

I got a plan with Hostinger a year ago, after the support at Strato failed me hard and left my VPS unreachable for 24 hours after some service crashed, not even able to restart it. I am realizing now that my plan is coming to an end, that the price is going to be almost double! I really don&#39;t need that many resources, and so I just want to find the cheapest, yet reliable VPS provider, and reading this subreddit many people do not seem to be a fan of Hostinger. Hence my two questions:</p> <ul> <li>What is the cheapest, yet somewhat reliable VPS provider, I am located in NL, but if the latency is low for providers in Germany or some other country, that is also fine (I am not very experienced with this stuff).</li> <li>How can I migrate my docker containers (with all volumes) to this new provider, so that I don&#39;t lose any data.</li> </ul> <p>",

I\u2019d like to stick with the free version of Cloudflare, but I still want to share Immich with my family.</p> <p>I\u2019m looking for something as simple as Cloudflare tunneling, but without the 100 Mbps bandwidth limitation. I don&#39;t want to ask my family to install a VPN like Tailscale on their devices, I\u2019d prefer a more user-friendly option for them.</p> <p>I tried several things, such as Nginx Proxy and Tailscale Funnel, but none of them worked.</p> <p>If you have any ideas or suggestions, I\u2019d really appreciate it.
