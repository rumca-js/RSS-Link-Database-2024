I&#39;m so happy to be married to them, and the ceremony went well aside from this little thing that&#39;s still bothering me. I&#39;m trying to remind myself that the only thing that matters is that we&#39;re married and love each other so I can move past it, but I keep thinking about it.</p> <p>I told the officiant ahead of time that we use they/them pronouns and she responded that this was fine, but we were on such a time crunch setting up that we didn&#39;t remind her before the ceremony started. I thought we were set because she even asked us what terms to use for the &quot;I now pronounce you...&quot; part, and we went with the neutral &quot;a married couple.&quot; But during the ceremony, we were both referred to with she/her.</p> <p>When the first &quot;she&quot; dropped we exchanged a subtle look, but it&#39;s not like we were going to interrupt the wedding ceremony ‚Äî ful

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>It breaks my heart that so many in the LGBTQ+ community, especially this time of year, are left homeless just for living their truth. üíî It‚Äôs mind-blowing how families can be so cruel, rejecting their own children for simply being who they are, and still claim to love them. No one deserves to be abandoned, especially not for embracing their true self. The world needs more love, acceptance, and understanding.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Vegetable_Date_2444"> /u/Vegetable_Date_2444 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/1hng2b7/heartbroken_over_how_many_are_homeless_for_simply/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/1hng2b7/heartbroken_over_how_many_are_homeless_for_simply/">[comments]</a></span>
