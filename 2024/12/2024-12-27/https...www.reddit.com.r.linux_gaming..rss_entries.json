Did they just recompiled kernel with some options? Added some flags to /sys/proc? What exactly did they did to optimize it? My curiosity comes from that i have been using gentoo for years i love portage, and i recently started to use it for games and i leave the ease of use with portsge to indtall vulkan and easy driver managment, but i was curious how would bazzite offer more performance? Could i apply it to my system without reinstalling? I looked around in their wiki couldnt find much.

I am running bazzite HTPC, which I am very happy with. Unfortunately I can not play everything I would like to and am searching for the safest way install and play some windows only titles. So far the best option seems to be creating a windows togo external nvme with rufus and using my USB-C 3.2 2x2 port. Looking for opinions on this as well as any further sugesstions, warnings, tutorials, etc. I also have only seen videos of people doing this with a system already running windows. Will I have any problems doing it from my kde desktop? Or should i use a different computer to create the drive. Again, i am sorry for not knowing much and happy for any information. I still have a lot to learn about linux. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/EDCmpc\"> /u/EDCmpc </a> <br/> <span><a hre",

Speaking of cs2, not only will you get rid of the problems with FPS drop and statting, but you&#39;ll probably get much more FPS than normal.</p> <p>Maybe not everyone knows about gamescope, maybe someone just forgot it existed.
