I am unsure from the kickstarter page, what exactly was produced and people own of this game, and what was never produced. Was the core + stretch goals delivered? I also see some expansions with their own stretch goals, and also see mentions of a wave 2 that was never delivered. I am wondering if wave 2 was a reprint, or part of the game that was never actually produced.

Right now they are LOVING chess! The problem I\u2019m running into is, they put all the pieces back in the cardboard box and put it on the shelf but pieces fall out. </p> <p>My proposed solution, ditch the boxes. I want to put sets of pieces in baggies and then store the boards on the shelf. Then students just grab a board and a bag and they\u2019re off. I was also thinking of doing this with games like mancala. </p> <p>My students are really good at putting all the pieces away, the issue is just the boxes. </p> <p>Thoughts?</p> <p>P. S.
