<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone! </p> <p>I&#39;m T, a security researcher at Microsoft. In my previous gig, I used to do some backend dev for a local startup. So, I had the opportunity to learn both research and development.</p> <p>And today I show you how it comes together.</p> <p>Dozens of hours and a few sleepless nights, gave birth to a new autonomous bug bounty agent. Granted, I would have loved to say &#39;the first&#39; - but I came in a cool second. Check out the amazing <a href="https://xbow.com/">XBow </a>when you get a chance.</p> <p>AEye is an LLM-powered BurpSuite extension. And if I had a buck for every LLM powered Burp extension I&#39;ve seen on LinkedIn, I would quit MSFT and buy an island.</p> <p>But to be fair, that&#39;s how AEye started. Instead of constantly querying ChatGPT for what this and that means and why things behave a certain way, I wanted it to see exactly what I&#39;m seeing.</p> <p>That is, until that motherfucker came up and said &#39;Y
