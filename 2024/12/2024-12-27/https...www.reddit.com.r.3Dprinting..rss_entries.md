Luckily he is still somewhat all about Santa, so the night before I got it out and wanted to get a grasp of how it worked so I could lend a hand after Santa dropped it off. Obviously they are designed to be easy and for kids, but it taught me a lot about the mechanics. I printed him a little snowman and wrote a note that it was from Santa. As of about 10pm on the 26th of Dec, he has figured out how to do about 8 prints, including changing filament colors on his own after showing him the little I knew. </p> <p>Tonight we had to reconnect to the wifi, which he got to learn.

Its been really fun learning with him.</p> <p>To my question though, he has run through the library that comes

My 8yo son wanted to make a gingerbread house so we used Tinkercad (first time for both of us) and printed this little house for a battery tea light. Was super fun and we learned a lot!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/mtnmama20"> /u/mtnmama20 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://i.redd.it/195fgh0x8b9e1.jpeg">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/1hn5sri/first_print_by_8yo/">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I don’t know if this is allowed here. If this isn’t, feel free to let me know. But anyways, this news is exciting for me anyways. As of this evening, I officially get to keep the 3D printer I was loaned! I’m pumped, guys!</p> <p>Also, side note - yes, I was the person with the clogged Kobra Neo a few weeks ago and to everyone who called clog, thanks! I was able to pull off the nozzle to look at it and yeah. There was a nasty clog in the nozzle itself. So thanks for that!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Star64"> /u/Star64 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/1hn3whk/i_finally_get_to_own_my_3d_printer/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/1hn3whk/i_finally_get_to_own_my_3d_printer/">[comments]</a></span>
