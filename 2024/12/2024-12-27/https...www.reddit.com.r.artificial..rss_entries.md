<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I tried <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-q-developer-now-generally-available-includes-new-capabilities-to-reimagine-developer-experience/">Amazon Q Developer</a>, Amazon&#39;s answer to Copilot and, so far, the results are &quot;meh.&quot;</p> <p>If you&#39;re using AWS, it&#39;s a great tool for asking specific questions, such as &quot;What were the top three highest-cost services in Q1?&quot; or a variety of other useful things, such as listing your lambda functions. Rather than just tell you how to do things, it gives answers immediately. For those not familiar with AWS, it&#39;s a great tool.</p> <p>It also has a command line tool, named <code>q</code>, appropriately enough, allowing me to use the AI from the command line, figuring out those tricky command line problems that I&#39;m always forgetting the exact syntax to. It worked decently, but the interface confused me at first and I accidentally ran a destructive <code>git</code
