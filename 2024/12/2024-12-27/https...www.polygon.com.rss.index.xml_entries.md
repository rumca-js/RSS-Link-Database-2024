<p class="has-text-align-none">Greetings, fellow nauseated traveler who just wanted to enjoy <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> but couldn’t manage to play for longer than an hour at a time. You’ve come to the right place. I, too, couldn’t deal with the strange head bob that our hero does in this first-person game. Through a combination of tweaks to the settings in the options menu, I’ve managed to make the game playable for myself — and probably for you, too.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Is it still a bit dizzying sometimes? Yes. Do I still wish the team at MachineGames would remove the head bob entirely? Yes. Please. But until that happens, these are my suggestions for getting through this adventure.

The downside is how fast that algo can get samey: Just because you watch <em>one single episode</em> of “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5baIt_zlv3A">Google Translate Sings</a>” doesn’t necessarily mean you want your YouTube launch page to suddenly push a thousand more episodes at you from the same channel.</p>
