<p>Over the holidays, this column will explore next year’s urgent issues. Today we look at why an unqualified belief in nuclear deterrence can’t keep us safe</p><p>Next November marks 40 years since the US president Ronald Reagan and the Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev <a href="https://www.reaganlibrary.gov/archives/speech/joint-soviet-united-states-statement-summit-meeting-geneva">declared</a> that “a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought”. The statement was striking – not least because their militaries were pouring billions into preparing for an unwinnable conflict.</p><p>A year later, at Reykjavik, the two came tantalisingly close to <a href="https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1981-88v11/d164">eliminating</a> nuclear weapons entirely. That historic chance slipped away over Reagan’s insistence on his unproven “Star Wars” missile defence system.

<p>Guardian writers recall their memorable occasions over the past year, from fraternity in the F1 paddock to an indiscreet moment in the darts</p><p>You hear all sorts of whispers at the Olympics; my favourite this year was about the 61-year-old grandmother Ni Xialian, who had an outside shot in the women’s table tennis. She won world titles for China in the early 1980s, then fell in love with another player, Tommy Danielsson, and moved to Luxembourg to run a hotel. She still plays and at this year’s Games she won her first match but <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/jul/31/auntie-ni-xia-lian-61-bows-out-olympics-table-tennis">lost to the world champion in the second</a>. Afterwards, she spent a happy hour offering life advice to the assembled press. “I was worried if I was good enough, but if you never play, you’ll never know,” she said, “and as I always say: ‘I’m always younger today than I will be tomorrow.’” <strong>Andy Bull</strong></p> <a href="https://w

<p>From singing about a smoke break to an unusual tribute to John Grant, Guardian writers pick the greatest songs of the year with the smallest of followings</p><p>“Strumming in opposition to the towers” is how the Bhutan-born, US-based guitarist Tashi Dorji describes his abstract, improvised music. His song and album titles are equally poetic evocations of resistance and decay – his new album is called We Will Be Wherever the Fires Are Lit and contains songs such as Meet Me Under the Ruins and Flowers for the Unsung – and the brusque, clanging strums of his acoustic guitar resound with turmoil and determination. The album opens with Begin From Here, his strings sounding rusted, his attack frenzied. But, gradually, a bass motif emerges from the static – cool-headed and clear of purpose. <em>Laura Snapes</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2024/dec/27/best-songs-you-havent-heard">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Dance till you drop, then home by 10pm – daytime events offer a glorious escape for those of us bogged down by responsibility</p><p>Last Saturday night, I went clubbing with friends. Once upon a time, this wouldn’t have been a remotely odd sentence to type, because it was what I did pretty much every weekend. But a lot has changed since then – let’s just say that in my peak raving years there was a Labour government in power, only it was actually popular – and like most people whose happy place was once on the dancefloor, inevitably with time comes the feeling that you no longer belong. Deep down, you still come to life when the bassline kicks in. But you morph from hardened raver to the kind of person who’s always up for dancing at parties and weddings, and then finally into the kind of person whose friends aren’t getting married any more and who spends their Saturday nights giving their children lifts to parties. So eventually you tell yourself sadly that those days are over now

<p>Peter Dinklage’s resonant turn as Hercule Poirot gives the beloved writer’s debut a charismatic reboot</p><p>When an army captain, on leave during the first world war, visits a family friend for the weekend at their country pile in Essex, he is hoping for some sunny respite from the frontline. Captain Hastings and John Cavendish are childhood friends, so Hastings is well acquainted with his family, who also include John’s brother Lawrence and their stepmother Emily.</p><p>The widowed Emily, we learn, has recently married Alfred Inglethorp, an American 20 years her junior, much to the ire of her children who believe him to be a gold digger. One night, Emily is taken ill and cries out from her bed. By the time Hastings and Lawrence arrive on the scene – they are forced to break down the door, as it is locked from the inside – she is dead. The next morning Hastings announces he has called a friend to investigate: a moustached Belgian named Hercule Poirot.</p> <a href="https://www.the

<p>Why did we succeeded when other hominins didn’t, and can lessons from our evolutionary past help rein in our destructive impulses?</p><p>In an institute in Germany, scientists are growing “Neanderthalised” human brain cells in a dish. These&nbsp;cells form synapses and spark as&nbsp;they would have done in a living Neanderthal as she (they are female cells) foraged or breastfed or gazed out of a cave mouth at dusk. That is the spine-tingling opening gambit of a book co-authored by one of the directors of the institute, Johannes Krause, and the information that sets it apart from a host of popular science books that attempt to predict humanity’s future based on our evolutionary past.</p><p>A mere 90 genetic differences distinguish modern humans, <em>Homo sapiens</em>, from Neanderthals, <em>Homo neanderthalensis</em>. That’s paltry, given the roughly 20,000 genes that make up&nbsp;the human blueprint, and not all of&nbsp;them affect the brain. Yet those 90&nbsp;differences could ex
