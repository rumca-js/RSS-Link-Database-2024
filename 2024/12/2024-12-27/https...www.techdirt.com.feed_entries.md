Some may also call it intrusive. Millions of miles are logged by drivers and pedestrians, year after year. And while those efforts to [&#8230;]

I had seen this story before Christmas making the rounds on Bluesky, claiming that United Healthcare had sent DMCA takedowns to Teepublic to remove artist Rachel Kenaston’s illustration of Luigi Magione, the guy arrested for shooting and killing United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson. While it does appear that Teepublic did, in fact, remove the image [&#8230;]

A central theme of Walled Culture the book (free digital versions available) and this blog is that the copyright industry is never satisfied. Now matter how long the term of copyright, publishers and recording companies want more. No matter how harsh the punishments for infringement, the copyright intermediaries want them to be even more severe. Another [&#8230;]

As much as I write about cops, you&#8217;d think I&#8217;d rarely be surprised by them or their thought processes. But, every so often, they surprise even me. Let&#8217;s take a ride back to early 1989, when the Broward County (FL) Sheriff&#8217;s Office was actually bragging about this sort of thing: A chemist with the Broward [&#8230;]

That&#8217;s why they&#8217;ve historically been so opposed to &#8220;right to repair&#8221; reforms that [&#8230;]
