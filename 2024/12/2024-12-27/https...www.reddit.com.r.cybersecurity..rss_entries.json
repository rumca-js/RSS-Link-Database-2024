I am aware that a MSSP does not require an SQL Database but it can be useful. Would this be the most efficient way of working? Or would a SQL Database simply create posibilites for other threats like injections?

He&#39;s looking to create an IAM team sometime in the near future and indicated that was an option, he also expressed that if there were other ideas I have that he would be open to them. One idea I am floating in my head is to create a team that does threat hunting and post incident/event analysis to bridge various gaps in our processes. Would it be a mistake to propose this? What would be better from a career perspective someone with engineering and soc experience as the threat hunting team lead or to be an engineer and then lead an IAM focused team?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.redd",
