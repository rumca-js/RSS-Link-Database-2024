<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’m using both systems and I generally prefer Usenet for better choice and faster access. But recently I’ve not been able to get what I’m looking for. Here&#39;s my observations and I would like to get the community’s comments on this. There seems to be some files available for some recent TV serials but many of them fail because they were “incomplete”. I read about this and figured that they had been forced off the platform due to copywrite complaints. All the content owners/creators are doing the same thing.</p> <p>- I think the usenet will gradually become useless for pirating movies and TV shows. They are sitting duck businesses, subject to laws. Content creators/owners have teams of very clever Indian programmers working on “bots” that crawl the Usenet, find content that violates the creators/owners copywrite and generate DMCA takedown documents that are delivered automatically to the various Usenet providers. The provider also has a process run

## How to Generate Usenet Articles with Cancel-Locks Using Thunderbird?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m trying to understand Usenet specifications and would like to generate messages with Cancel-Locks as specified in RFC 8315. To do this, I would need a Usenet client that automatically posts messages with the calculated Cancel-Lock field, or I would need access to the Message-ID of proto-articles before posting in order to calculate it manually.</p> <p>As far as I know, Thunderbird doesn&#39;t support either of these features. However, I&#39;ve seen messages in text newsgroups with a User-Agent of Thunderbird that include valid Cancel-Locks, like this:</p> <pre><code>Message-Id: &lt;vkaic4$t8n2$1@dont-email.me&gt; User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:24.0) Gecko/20100101 Thunderbird/24.3.0 Cancel-Lock: sha1:GGmAddL3shnovaCu7R53m3R6oPU= </code></pre> <p>How do people manage to do this? I&#39;m starting to think they might generate a random SHA-1 cancel key, hash it again with SHA-1 to create the cancel-lock, and then add this cance

## Where do Indexers get their content?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been using Usenet for over 25 years and I have often wondered where do Indexers obtain their content from?</p> <p>I&#39;m not talking about the indexers that scrape plain text headers. </p> <p>The private indexer I use most often must be posting things themselves as the subject lines are obfuscated and many are password protected. Obviously it must be automated because there is no way someone is posting thousands of items on a daily basis, but where are they obtaining that content from? </p> <p>Things are usually posted to Usenet before I see them on my private torrent sites so that&#39;s not their source.</p> <p>Are they sourcing things from private IRC channels, or private FTP sites or private message boards? Or a combination of those?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/activoice"> /u/activoice </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1hngg5k/where_do_indexers_ge

## Anyone here from the late 1990's remember a guy who went by the name of Archer Troy? He used to frequent the old usenet boards selling screeners of movies.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I frequent the old alt video tape trading forum and at one time there was alt video bootleg. There was a guy who went by the name of Archer Troy and also went under a variety of different names. Back in 1997-1998, there were many posts about this guy who would claim to have scripts, screeners and workprints of various movies and would take money from people and never give them a thing. The stories on this guy are amusing to say the least. When alt video tape bootleg was around, there was a post where he was busted by the MPAA and had his tapes taken away. The post was funny but yet it made me wonder for those who were tape trading in those days were the busts real and was this guy responsible for why a lot of traders got busted by the MPAA?</p> <p>Anyone for those wanting a hilarious read, go to alt video tape trading and read the posts on this guy. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Fabulous_Incre

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Just wanted to say a big thanks to the users here.</p> <p>I recently decided to give Usenet a go. I&#39;m a fan of Linux ISO&#39;s , but found I was having difficulty with getting some older and obscure ones.</p> <p>I looked at the possibility of getting a seed box and going private tracker until I came across this sub. It&#39;s packed full of very useful information and in the end Usenet seemed like a better option for me.</p> <p>I&#39;ve been setup now about 4 weeks and all of those Linux ISO&#39;s I wanted are on my home server. Set myself up with 3 Usenet provided , Newshosting , Eweka and bulknews. Signed up to a few indexers and forums that where mentioned on here. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever get into any of the bigger named private indexers that are invite only (I don&#39;t use reddit enough to get the karma points for invites). However the indexers I have signed up to have provided everything I need. </p> <p>I even started uploading some
