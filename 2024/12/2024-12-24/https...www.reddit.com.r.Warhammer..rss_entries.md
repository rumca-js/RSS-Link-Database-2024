<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m fascinated by the plight of fortifications (and fliers but that&#39;s an issue for another day) in 40k. Clearly they have enough people buying them for GW to not drop support entirely but it&#39;s also no secret that they&#39;re not a hot commodity either. </p> <p>The way I see it fortifications have several big issues, some of which can be addressed some of which cannot.
