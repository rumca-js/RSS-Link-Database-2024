Womanhood is a lifelong experience, not a feeling or mindset. We&#39;re not gonna belittle the beauty that is the female experience by just calling anyone a woman including people who simply are not. The female body was created for its own unique purpose and possesses its own unique qualities that make it incredibly strong, powerful, and resilient. Our bodies were made to create and sustain life, which is what makes
