And I need an RSS that gives feeds with an XML format.</p> <p>I&#39;m looking for an RSS feed generator, preferably free of charge, whose output would serve as the 1st step in an automation scenario on <a href=\"http://make.com\">make.com</a>. I think <a href=\"http://rss.app\">rss.app</a> is great but they only give you a 7-day trial (I considered paying for the most basic plan but I think it&#39;s not worth it for my case), I tried stuff like Raven but it doesn&#39;t generate XML file, so it can&#39;t give me the result I need.</p> <p>P.S: I have Windows 11 and Ubuntu Linux, i preferably want to stay on Win11 for now.
