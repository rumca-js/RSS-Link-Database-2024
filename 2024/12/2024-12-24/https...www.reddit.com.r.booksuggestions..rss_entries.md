<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I (31F) have been going through serious health problems for four years that have left me severely disabled for two years. I&#39;m very limited in what I can do so I can&#39;t engage in many joyful activities. Over the last several months, I&#39;ve started intensive treatment, so have been hyper focused on my health and little else. However, recently I realised that I&#39;ve become incredibly serious and haven&#39;t laughed for a long, long time because of how focused I&#39;ve been on my health, as well as how depressing everything is. I take everything so seriously these days. I used to laugh a lot, be very facetious and see the funny side of everything, but I&#39;ve lost that now.</p> <p>Does anyone have any suggestions for books (or even films or TV shows) that can help me loosen up and laugh? Books I&#39;ve found funny in the past include Eleanor Oliphant Is Completely Fine and On Writing by Stephen King. Sitcoms I&#39;ve enjoyed include Friends,

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>My favorite book of all time is Exquisite Corpse by Poppy Z Brite, mainly because he does something so masterfully, which is being able to depict the most graphically grotesque horror with the most beautifully sensual prose. I&#39;m not looking for psychological horror as much just bc it tends to make me feel more icky than straight up gratuity does and im trying to crawl back out of a reading slump. I tried Mexican Gothic by Sylvia Moreno and while I liked it, it just didn&#39;t scratch that same itch for me. I particularly love the gayness in Brite&#39;s work, and i feel like maybe reading another trans author might help? I love Cailtlin Kiernan&#39;s prose for a similar reason as Brite&#39;s, but it often doesnt have that same level of violence and real fear that his books have (Exquisite Corpse, and Drawing Blood are my top 2) i recognize that this might be kinda specific but i figured id just throw this out into the internet void to see if anyon

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello, I would like to ask for any suggestion for a good medieval ages like fantasy book. I havent read any story books or novels in ages. I&#39;ve read algebra and calculus books before, they make you escape reality in a different way. I would not recommend those types of book, unless you want to throw away your sanity. I am fine with a short one or a long story or a series and chronicles of books. Any suggestion would be appreciated, thank you.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/zack-ian"> /u/zack-ian </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1hl421d/good_medieval_fantasy_book_for_beginner/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1hl421d/good_medieval_fantasy_book_for_beginner/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi 👋🏻☺️ Me and my husband have decided that we&#39;d like to read at the same time, but we have no idea what. Does anyone have any suggestions? Maybe a novel that&#39;s also now a film? We recently read a Ballard of Songbird and Snakes and then watched the movie. Something similar would be great. Our preferred genres would be crime, dystopian fiction, thriller, suspense, action etc. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/saffysmiles"> /u/saffysmiles </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1hl0yzs/looking_for_a_good_book_for_me_and_my_husband_to/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1hl0yzs/looking_for_a_good_book_for_me_and_my_husband_to/">[comments]</a></span>
