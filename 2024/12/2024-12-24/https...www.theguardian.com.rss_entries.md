Is it because it is still a part-pagan festival? Is it because we don’t like to let ourselves be too happy? Or is it because the whole family is likely to be home and you need to remind yourself that there could be more malevolent forces out there than in here, whatever the toxic dynamics? Perhaps it’s just because it gets dark so early.</p><p>Whatever the reason, here is another half-hour shiver from Mark Gatiss, adapted this time not from the output of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/dec/23/a-ghost-story-for-christmas-count-magnus-review-mark-gatisss-creepy-tale-could-barely-be-less-thrilling">his beloved MR James</a>, but from a more unexpected source.

I had visited the mall Santa a few weeks before and been crystal clear in my request for a magic tea set and world peace (see? Insufferable).

<p>The instrumental theme tune is popular, catchy and authoritative – perfect for the coloniser’s news service. Unfortunately, everyone knows the lyrics</p><p>The British Broadcasting Corporation’s Somali service <a href="https://www.bbc.com/somali/bbc_somali_radio/programmes/p034117k">theme tune</a> is one of the most popular and recognisable sounds for people in Somalia and the diaspora. With a whistling rhythm and melody, it is authoritative and catchy. The words that follow the music haven’t changed for more than 60 years: “<em>Halkaniwaa</em> BBC – this is the BBC.”</p><p>Hiding in plain acoustics, however, is the fact that the lyrics originally written – although not used – for the music are deeply anti-colonial, and deliberately designed to be remembered by Somalis every time they listen to the British radio station’s instrumental. In essence, the theme is an anti-colonial free ad on the coloniser’s airwaves, a fervent proclamation and calling to attention for the public.</p><

<p>While some residents take to building houses in trees, officials recognise need for national response to climate disasters</p><p>Every summer, Dongting Hu, China’s second-largest freshwater lake, swells in size as flood water from the Yangtze River flows into its borders. Dams and dikes are erected around the lake’s edges to protect against flooding. But this year, not for the first time, they were overwhelmed.</p><p>For three days in early July, more than 800 rescue workers in Hunan province scrambled to block the breaches. One rupture alone took 100,000 cubic metres of rock to seal, <a href="https://www.chinadailyhk.com/hk/article/587615">according to</a> Zhang Yingchun, a Hunan official. At least 7,000 people had to be evacuated. It was one of a series of disasters to hit China as the country grappled with a summer of extreme weather.

There is a fine history of moonlit metamorphoses in werewolf movies: moans that deepen into growls, the stretching and twisting of muscle, fur sprouting at lightning speed. In fact, some people criticised this film for shying away from the body horror at the heart of Mother’s animalistic breakdown. But there is a powerful whiff of catharsis in this low-key transformation scene: watching Adams sniff the midnight air, dig with bare hands into her own tidy suburban lawn, down on her paws, ful

We’ve just passed the 25th birthday of the London club Fabric, and the mind reels at the fact that <em>millions</em> of dancers have passed through the doors since it opened. And that’s one club: if&nbsp;that was a lot to squeeze into a single narrative, how do we even begin to think about the evolution of British clubbing more broadly in the first quarter of the 21st century? Can we even talk about a “clubbing scene” as 2025 approaches and dance music seems to exist on TikTok and at mega-festivals more than sweaty high street dives? Is&nbsp;there a common thread through an era that’s given us grime, dubstep, EDM, amapiano, deconstructed club, hyperpop and a hundred other flavours besides?

<p>Who is a god of TV? Who has magical chemistry? And who deserves to be lightning-bolted for bad behaviour? Here are Guardian readers’ best shows of the year</p><p>(Netflix) My favourite show of 2024. It seems to be a rarity in TV that a singular vision survives the creation by committee process. But in Ripley, Steven Zaillian gives us stylish black-and-white cinematography that’s usually reserved for the artiest of arthouse cinema. We get a meticulous mise-en-scene that makes every crime scene a puzzle for the viewer to dissect. And, most importantly, we get incredible central performances from Andrew Scott, Dakota Fanning and Johnny Flynn. This truly felt like a labour of love and for me surpasses both the source material and the previous film adaptation. For those eight hours, I was utterly transfixed. It also helps that for the first two episodes I didn’t realise I had subtitles turned off, so thought it was an intentional decision to avoid translating the Italian. It’s a testam

<p>The premise – a young man cosies up to his grandmother for the sake of her will – sounds cynical, but this is actually a tear-jerker with an important point</p><p>The title makes it sound like some goofy Brit crime comedy; in fact it’s a sweet, sad heart-warmer from Thailand, whose original title Lahn Mah, or Grandma’s Grandchild, is closer to the mark. (And anyway, given that we’re talking about inheritance, shouldn’t it be “after grandma dies” not “before”?)</p><p>Television director Pat Boonnitipat makes his feature film debut and 78-year-old Usha Seamkhum, a former TV commercials model making her film acting debut, gives a lovely performance as Menju, a widow who has accepted her terminal cancer with unsentimental calm. But she is well aware her will could cause problems with her grownup children; these are uptight stockbroker Kiang, boozy gambling addict Soei and hard-working Sew, whose son M (Putthipong Assaratanakul) is the centre of the story.</p> <a href="https://www.theg

<p>The wildly acclaimed novel about a perimenopausal woman going on a journey of erotic awakening has left a wave of women following in the protagonist’s wake</p><p>‘I don’t read books that literally,” says Abra, 49, from Arizona. “I&nbsp;don’t read literature as self-help.” But we’re talking about All Fours, the second novel by the American artist and author Miranda July, which came out this year, and the way it changed her life. The New York Times called it “the first great perimenopause novel” and “the talk of every group text”, having started “a whisper network of women fantasising about desire and freedom”. This is a novel that made women blow up their lives; every book group had a friend of a friend whose life had been shaken to its foundations.</p><p>If you’ve not read the book, the plot can be summarised thus: an artist – wife to a Good Guy, mother to an under-10 – sets off on a road trip and gets distracted by a dancer. She moves into a motel room to stay near him, and remod

But, Dorman insists, “It’s just a story, sir … a silly story.” <strong>Hollie Richardson</strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/dec/24/christmas-eve-tv-e-nesbits-classic-ghost-story-is-a-festive-fright">Continue reading...</a>

I was in the middle of a divorce and had turned 30 believing my life was over in the way only a 29-year-old could. Christmas was set to be a nice reprieve from the misery, spending a week with my family and eagerly awaiting the promise of a new year. I felt tentatively hopeful.</p><p>Ten days before the holiday, my throat began to hurt. “Tonsilitis!” the doctor said, giving me a prescription for antibiotics. The pain didn’t abate, even after a week, so I dutifully went back for another dose. The pain got worse. On Christmas Eve, with no GP surgeries open, my mum drove me to the local walk-in clinic. A doctor took one look in my mouth and said I had a quinsy (don’t Google this, for the love of God, but it’s basically a throat abscess) and&nbsp;told me to get to the nearest A&amp;E as soon as possible.</p> <a href=
