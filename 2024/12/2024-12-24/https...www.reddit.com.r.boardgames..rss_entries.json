My question is multi-faceted. </p> <p>First, how do you go from 4 to 6? Do you buy them with Colonist and Tribune cards?</p> <p>Second, after building houses do you put your colonist back into your warehouse or are they running around the rest of the game after being placed initially?</p> <p>My best guess from reading this is that Tribune cards play colonists from the warehouse, while Colonist cards can add one of the two you didn\u2019t start with in your warehouse, and once they\u2019re on the board they just stay active the whole game.
