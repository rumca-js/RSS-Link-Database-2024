<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’ve read many threads here on this subreddit claiming that AI unlocks creativity, allows humans to engage in more creative tasks, and offers various other benefits. However, I argue the opposite—at least based on my knowledge and experience.</p> <p>I&#39;ve been a Software Engineer for about 5-7 years now, and before the AI revolution and the emergence of large language models (LLMs), when engineers I worked with encountered a problem, they would break it down, discuss it with each other, debate solutions, and often come up with really bright ideas. We would proceed with those solutions collaboratively. But in the past few months, this approach seems to have diminished.</p> <p>Nowadays, when we encounter an obstacle or a problem, all you hear is, &quot;Just ask ChatGPT,&quot; &quot;Use Claude,&quot; or &quot;Maybe try Gemini; it&#39;s better.&quot; Let&#39;s be honest—it often works, even if it&#39;s mostly code that can be enhanced.
