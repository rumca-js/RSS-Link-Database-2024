The entire infrastructure would collapse, buildings would rumble under all the weight of the snow. Power failure, Electricity and water shortages. The government trying to find solutions. I thought of this idea because we want to go to Bosnia for the holiday, where it\u2019s been snowing for the past 3 days, so it\u2019s going to be hard driving there. There\u2019s also been a power out today. Hopefully tap water will stay and power will probably come back tomorrow. That made me think what if it just dosent stop snowing, how would civilisation survive. I would love see my imagined scenario visualized to watch a movie, if there isn\u2019t one there definelty should be one.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Open-Platform9637\"> /u/Open-Platform9637 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/",

There was a scene with a woman who was distraught, and a guy had brought her a cake for some reason. Then she flips out and starts stabbing and slashing him with a big kitchen knife. Blood everywhere, and gets all over the cake. She slashes his face and he has huge cuts on his face. Finally he dies, and she puts the cake in the fridge, covered in blood, and hides his body in the couch. This would have been mid to late 80s, and I&#39;m super curious to identify this movie!

And since then, I don&#39;t think one film has come close to matching this blend of genres. A tin of TV shows have tried their hand.

No wonder why it\u2019s the world\u2019s best rated movie (at least on IMdB). Inception, Shutter Island and Interstellar follow close plot and execution-wise in my option. Not to mention the cinematography is off the top in all these movies. Ofc, there\u2019s hundreds more to cover but this one\u2019s stellar. Lemme know what your choices are guys!</p> <p>[Edit: I apologize for not being more thoughtful in my post description about Shawshank Redemption. Rookie mistake.

The Green Knight himself. </p> <p>But seriously, why don\u2019t more people bring this one up when they\u2019re talking about A24\u2019s best? It\u2019s weird in all the best ways, super ambitious, and just unapologetically doing its own thing. I get that it\u2019s not for everyone\u2014it\u2019s slow and kinda cryptic, but that\u2019s what makes it so good, IMO. It feels like an old-school myth come to life, and it\u2019s just dripping with atmosphere. Anyone else feel the same? Also, kind of a Christmas movie in a strange way.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/jdcmopwjdmw\"> /u/jdcmopwjdmw </a> <br/> <span><a hr",

Toy Story details aside it&#39;s a pretty great TV movie, with the wamrth whimsy and imagination usually expected of Henson- sudden plotpoints and the overfeaturing of human characters (it&#39;d have been better if they were only heard but never fully seen) are the only faint issues.
