<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I just seen today on CDRomance that there will be no more updates. It&#39;s understandable as to the reason why. So many people are getting cracked down on, so it&#39;s totally understandable. </p> <p>My only thing with the announcement was this. There&#39;s the announcement that nothing will be updated on there anymore, then immediately ask people to continue donations. Like if nothing will ever be added or anything, why would I need to still contribute money. I know bandwidth costs, but still kind of odd IMO. Someone says that they don&#39;t really like all the exposure, but wants to pay for the site to continue on. Almost feel like if that&#39;s the case, then why not have somebody else keep the side up.
