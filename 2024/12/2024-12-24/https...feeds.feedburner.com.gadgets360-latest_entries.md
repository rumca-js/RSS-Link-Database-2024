The Ursid meteor shower will peak on December 22, 2024, providing a final chance for stargazing before the year ends. However, the event may not be as spectacular due to the bright last-quarter moon, which could obscure many of the dimmer meteors. While ideal conditions might allow for up to 10 meteors per hour, experts predict only about five per hour due to the moon's interference. The meteors, originating from the debris of Comet 8P/Tuttle, radiate from the constellation Ursa Minor. Stargazers are advised to find dark locations and wait until after midnight for the best viewing
