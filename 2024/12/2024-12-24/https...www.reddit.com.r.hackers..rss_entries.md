<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello people, I am playing a game now which is online and every change is reflected in database instantly. It is always syncing. Initially I thought it was impossible to read the chats in the game, but many players told me that many top players do it. I also saw discord post about it. The game is online game and you can play it on browser, pc or mobile phone. On PC it has game client. I want to understand how it is possible?
