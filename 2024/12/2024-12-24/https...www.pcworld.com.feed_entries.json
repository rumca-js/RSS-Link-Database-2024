I test <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/407277/best-antivirus-for-windows-pc.html\">antivirus software</a>, give tips on how to make Windows more secure, am constantly on the lookout for the best security tools, and monitor the activities of cyber criminals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the years, I have acquired a whole range of behaviors and principles that seem completely normal and sensible to me.
