        "description": "Attached: 1 image\n\nThe number pi has an evil twin!   It's a number called \u03d6 with many properties similar to \u03c0.  There are even mutant trig functions connected to this number, called sl and cl.   \n\nSo maybe while you were studying trig in high school, some kid in another galaxy was having to memorize all the identities for these other functions.\n\nI doubt it.  Just as pi and trig functions are connected to the circle, this number \u03d6 and its mutant trig functions are connected to a curve shaped like the symbol for infinity, \u221e.   But this curve is just less important than the circle.  I'm not enough of a cultural relativist to believe there's a civilization that cares more about the shape \u221e than the shape \u25ef.\n\nThis \u221e-shaped curve is called a 'leminscate', and \u03d6 is called the 'lemniscate constant'.   I'll show you the leminiscate in my next post.   \n\nA civilization will probably only get interested in \u03d6 when it gets interested in the lemniscate.... or the deeper math it's connected to.
