Initially I thought it was impossible to read the chats in the game, but many players told me that many top players do it. I also saw discord post about it. The game is online game and you can play it on browser, pc or mobile phone. On PC it has game client. I want to understand how it is possible? Can someone explain it to me? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/MrutyunjayKarn\"> /u/MrutyunjayKarn </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/hackers/comments/1hlbijp/using_python_scripts_to_read_the_chat/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/hackers/comments/1hlbijp/using_python_scripts_to_read_the_chat/\">[comments]</a></span>",
