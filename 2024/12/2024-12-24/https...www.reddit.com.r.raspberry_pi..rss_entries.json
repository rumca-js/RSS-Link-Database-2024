I also can&#39;t update nor do anything else needing internet connectivity via Terminal. I had Nord running on the Pi, so I disconnected (since I thought maybe VPN through VPN might be affecting it), but nothing, then just uninstalled Nord since I don&#39;t really need it.

With limited space and development time, my plan is to use a Raspberry Pi 4 CM to serve this purpose. However, there is only one PCIe x2 line available on the RP4 CM.</p> <p><strong>Current Solution</strong></p> <p>My current solution is to split the PCIe line into two using a PCIe Switch (TDS4A212MX). One PCIe line will serve the USB 3.0 Host Device (TUSB7320), and the other will connect to an M.2 SSD (SATA).</p> <p><strong>My questions</strong></p> <ol> <li><p>Is there any fault with my approach? If so, could you suggest an alternative?</p></li> <li><p>How can I properly switch between PCIe x1 lines using the PCIe switch so that no data is lost? So far, I have not encountered any documentation that addresses this.</p></li> <li><p>How should I properly terminate unused USB 3.0 ports? This is not mentioned in the data",
