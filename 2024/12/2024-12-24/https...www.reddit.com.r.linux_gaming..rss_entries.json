I&#39;ve noticed that ever since I upgraded to F41 Wayland, my FPS took a serious hit. I recently upgraded my PC to very decent specs:</p> <p>CPU: 7800X3D</p> <p>GPU: 5700XT (had it before my CPU upgrade - no problems)</p> <p>RAM: 32GBs Team Group DDR5 6000</p> <p>MOBO: ASRock B650 PG Lightning</p> <p>OS: Fedora Linux 41 (KDE Plasma)</p> <p>Kernel: Linux 6.12.5-200.fc41.x86_64</p> <p>Mesa: 24.2.8</p> <p>I always record locally at 1080/60 and with my new CPU, it&#39;s even way smoother. My 5700XT can max out my entire Steam library at 1080/144 (monitor) no problem at all. DotA 2 and TF2 I get 300fps easy. This was all on Fedora 40 when I was using X11.</p> <p>I am beginning to think that Wayland on 41 is the culprit here. I tried to install an X11 session but when I boot into it on 41, I get a black screen. I then have to restart, log into a Waylan sess",

I managed to figure out how to get Steam to open on login as well as get it to big picture mode. The goal was to essentially make a custom SteamOS console for her so it&#39;s as easy as possible.</p> <p>The one issue that I can&#39;t seem to find an answer for is how to get the system to power down from BPM directly. Currently, when I select Power Off system from BPM steam sits there as a black screen. I need to then use a keyboard to open the ZorinOS menu and select Power Off. I have configured the power button to turn the system off when it&#39;s pressed but I would love a BPM solution if possible.</p> <p>Has anyone else run into this same issue.

It seems that, for some reason, when a lot of GPU load is removed, some of it stays? It&#39;s really peculiar, but after loading back into either a new game I&#39;ve just booted up or the current game once the loading screen is done, my performance will be HORRENDOUS - MangoHud shows that GPU load is incredibly high for no discernible reason. MangoHud doesn&#39;t report any throttling either. This is API-agnostic, I&#39;ve seen it happen on OpenGL and Vulkan so the issue doesn&#39;t relate to APIs.</p> <p>The issue completely disappears on a reboot. Sometimes the issue doesn&#39;t appear at all during a session, or it&#39;ll happen on the first boot of a game - it happens often enough to be an annoyance and for me to ask about here.</p> <p>Thanks for any help /",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>So I got a AMD Radeon 6600 from eBay last year, and ever since ive been having these weird crashes when gaming on Linux. Whenever a game puts significant load on your GPU eventually (but seemingly at random) either your screen goes blank, then the image pops back up but everything&#39;s frozen and you have to hard reboot the computer, or it crashes to the login screen.</p> <p>In trying to fix this ive seen lots of people report similar things with various AMD cards. The crash does not seem to happen on Windows at all which makes me think it wasn&#39;t ever a hardware issue.</p> <p>So I tried for weeks to fix it, I tried changing kernels, switching to flatpack steam, updating mesa, checked my ram, changed a bunch of bios settings, installed a program to set the GPU power level to always high...</p> <p>I tried Debian, Pop OS, Noboru, Manjaro, MX Linux and every freaking time any game that put significant load on the GPU would eventually crash.</p> <p>E",

I installed the ALVR app on both my PC and my Quest, and have been able to pair my headset with my PC. Unfortunately, I haven&#39;t had any luck in getting the video to actually display and it just shows a blank screen on my headset.</p> <p>When I try running a VR game on Steam, the game runs in VR mode on my PC, and the camera moves as I move my headset around, but the stream is still blank on my headset. I have an NVIDIA GPU if that helps. Any help would be appreciated.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Perfect_Wrongdoer_41\"> /u/Perfect_Wrongdoer_41 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1hl12n0/has_anyone_been_successful_in_getting_steamvr_to/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1hl12n0/has_anyone_been_successful_in_g",
