Here&#39;s what I‚Äôve already tried:</p> <ol> <li>Blocked internet access for the FIFA 23 <code>.exe</code> file.</li> <li>Updated my GPU drivers to the latest version.</li> <li>Turned off CPU overclocking.</li> <li>Set compatibility mode to Windows 8 and ran the launcher as an administrator.</li> <li>Reinstalled the EA Anti-Cheat service.</li> </ol> <p>Despite all this, the problem persists. If anyone has faced a similar issue or has a potential solution, I‚Äôd really appreciate your help.
