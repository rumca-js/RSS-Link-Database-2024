I have seen a bunch of posts of people discussing their settings, but not so much the combination of RTX 3080 with Quest 3. My setup is PC Ethernet-cabled to router, which is WIFI6 and only 2-3 meters away from play area. I have an RTX 3080, a Ryzen 3900x and a Quest 3. I have done most of my testing using Half Life Alyx and also used these settings for Metro Awakening so far. I am pretty happy with them and they give me a good balance of Render Quality and Latency, but I would like to ask if there is anything I am missing or what I could try to improve further. So here we go. My current settings are:</p> <p>HEVC 10-bit 90 hz Bitrate: 120 Mbps VDXR Render Quality: Ultra</p> <p>I don\u2019t use Snapdragon Super Resolution, SSW and no automatic Bitrate. With these settings I get between 35-50ms, which is fine for me in general. I couldn\u2019t really get below 30ms in any scenario without massiv",

I own a ps5 no PC, my last VR experience was on the original psvr. Graphics have always been important for me but there&#39;s some quest games I really want to try such as Golf+, bonelab, and a few others that arent supported on psvr, and with the quest optimizer it seems like theres not a huge difference in non AAA titles as far as graphics go? I&#39;ll also say being untethered isn&#39;t a huge deal for me as I live in an apartment and there&#39;s not a ton of room to take advantage or being wireless. I guess my main concern is how much I would really be missing out on going with psvr. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Responsible-Rub2732\"> /u/Responsible-Rub2732 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1hlgqcb/paralysis_of_analysis_psv",

I have had an original HTC Vive since 2019 with the Gen 1 base stations and bought the Index controllers as an upgrade after an about a year of use. I have used it a ton and beat H-L: Alyx twice</p> <p>I know the hardware is dated but VR is still VR and I know it would still work if I set it up The problem is currently my living situation has changed and I really don\u2019t have room for the base stations to be set up. Can\u2019t mount them on wall since I\u2019m renting and the stands I had for them will get knocked by movement due to being close if they are set up</p> <p>Is it worth upgrading to the Quest 3 for the better hardware and experience plus ease of use and setup or should I continue with what I have? And if there\u2019s any recommendations to get me up and running again to be comfortable? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.r",
