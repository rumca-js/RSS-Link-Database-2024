I DESPERATELY need some more books to satisfy my unquenchable thirst for a new book. I have scoured though various different Reddit post about books similar to the selection but they aren’t quite what I’m looking for. In the series the thing I enjoyed the most was the setting of the whole story. I loved how whimsical but modern the setting is, and the balls and how they get to have kinda like a life of a princess. I also enjoyed how the main two characters actually interacted with eachother instead of insta love where it makes no sense at all how they fell in love. I also loved books by Melanie celliar, especially the spoken mage series because of how it was set. Someone please help me I desperately need a book to read.</p> <p>Also side note: if you have any magic academy rivals to lovers

## Books that are better in print than ebook

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Ebooks are convenient for having an entire library in your pocket but one thing they don&#39;t do well is footnotes, appendices, and more generally, consistent formatting. There are different sized E-readers and you can customize the font &amp; font size but that sacrifices some authorial intent for authors that intentionally craft some sections to all fit on the same page. </p> <p>With that said, have you read anything that wouldn&#39;t work as an ebook or just works better physically? I&#39;m thinking of books like House of Leaves, but IMO a lot of Pratchett books with footnotes also suffer as ebooks(you can&#39;t really see them unless you hit the asterisk, they don&#39;t exist on the bottom of the &quot;page&quot;). </p> <p>Any particularly lyrical passages that would have less impact if they were on separate pages? Any cool illustrations or other things that you&#39;ve noticed are different on an ereader to the physical?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->

I am not suggesting there arent great books with amazing world building out there but there was always something about them that was missing in terms of flow..</p> <p>Not sure if you agree but Harry Potter and ASOIAF are two good examples for me. Sure asoiaf is an all time great but even harry potter targeted for slightly younger audience had always that page turner factor, maybe it was the world, maybe it was the mystery.</p> <p>And i tried for instance Memory Sorrow Thorn, Malazan, WoT etc. All fantastic books with great and deep world building but at the end of the day, i didnt feel the journey in these books as much as the destination..i knew payoffs would be great, they would make me think and dream, but reading itself didnt flow. </p> <p>So in your personal opinion and taste, what are some of the fantasy or sci fi books

Adult fiction, preferably lots of worldbuilding and no SA or incest (I keep getting &quot;surprised&quot; with it in books).

It has two main characters. Boy and girl. Who pine for each other but it isn&#39;t the main point of the story. Like it is a slow burn but the more important part is the journey or task they have to do. It&#39;s even better if there is a duo pov between the two but not a must.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Looking for dark fantasy or just more serious / gritty stories. Newer to the fantasy genre as a whole so not sure of examples I could give.</p> <p>For context I am a big horror fan in general, and I find myself wanting to get into more fantasy content. I could look around on the internet as a whole to find top 10 lists of suggestions or what not but unfortunately usually have to end up spoiling the book for myself to ensure it doesn&#39;t contain anything that would ruin the entire thing for me.</p> <p>I am mainly looking for what the title says but with the big caveat of no rape stuff. I find it taints entire stories and is the main reason despite seeming interesting I will not touch a song of ice and fire / game of thrones with a 10ft pole. That&#39;s kind of the only thing, I like the darker themed stories but have found that for some reason dark or more gritty fantasy is kinda a landmine of the stuff.</p> <p>Additionally would prefer shorter seri

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Bingo Categories: Judge a Book by Its Cover, Eldritch Creatures (HM), Multi-POV (HM)</p> <p>Content Warnings: This is one of those horror books that runs the whole gamut of disturbing and disturbingly grounded evils. There are quite graphic scenes of abuse and violence <span class="md-spoiler-text">against children and animals. </span></p> <p>This novel follows a few generations of a small family unit entangled with a large wealthy occult family and secret society in late twentieth century Argentina wracked by it&#39;s historical upheavals. The arc of the novel begins with Juan Peterson, a gifted medium with congenital heart failure who is adopted by a wealthy family to secure their place in a secret society with dark and eldritch goals that has been scouring the world for mediums who can connect them to their dark god. He hopes to shelter his son and potential heir, Gaspar, who the later parts of the novel follow, interspersed with a few flashbacks 

## I'm looking for recommendations of niche fantasy series featuring "full plate" power armor clad heroes facing monsters, and are action focused.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>My first thought is I keep thinking of the power armor from Way of Kings, with them facing giant monsters but with magic mixed in. Armor that should be impossibly heavy but it is making the user stronger and empowering them instead of slowing them down. Or have the magic be embued into items like armor, instead of being channeled, let&#39;s say a shield or a helmet that does something magical.</p> <p>I keep thinking it&#39;s just out of reach, something like a battle mage or warhammer 40k suits of armor.</p> <p>A story that&#39;s full of action and adventure, not so much romance. Something straight to the point like the sci-fi story Armor.</p> <p>Another story I think of is the science fiction Forever War, where eventually because of a anti-technology field soldiers of the future are fighting aliens with medieval weapons.</p> <p>I was a giant fan of Warcraft 3 growing up and for all the fantasy I loved over the years, I haven&#39;t found concepts as

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello everyone! Today, I have finished watching the LotR trilogy for the first time (the extended version, never completely watched the movies before, just the Hobbit), and while I&#39;ve never felt a desire to read the books, it did spark a very specific reading mood in me. It has been ages since I last read a fantasy book with &quot;classic&quot; vibes I&#39;d say... like wizards, fighting scenes, a bunch of weird/lonely/brave and a bit broken people finding family in each other and a &quot;Let&#39;s go on a quest!&quot; energy. Adults only, preferably lots of worldbuilding, weel developed/wholesome friendships and very little to no romance (also, no SA or incest (I keep getting &quot;surprised&quot; with it in books)). Thanks in advance! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/carol_brrrrrrrru"> /u/carol_brrrrrrrru </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1hl1ajc/looking_fo

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have watched Castlevania, Blood of Zeus, and Arcane although I didn&#39;t finish all seasons yet.
