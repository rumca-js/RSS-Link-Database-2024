Since then, no other books have been worth reading. I DESPERATELY need some more books to satisfy my unquenchable thirst for a new book. I have scoured though various different Reddit post about books similar to the selection but they aren\u2019t quite what I\u2019m looking for. In the series the thing I enjoyed the most was the setting of the whole story. I loved how whimsical but modern the setting is, and the balls and how they get to have kinda like a life of a princess. I also enjoyed how the main two characters actually interacted with eachother instead of insta love where it makes no sense at all how they fell in love. I also loved books by Melanie celliar, especially the spoken mage series because of how it was set. Someone please help me I desperately need a book to read.</p> <p>Also side note: if you have any magic academy rivals to lovers ",

For example, I have the Dreamblood duology by N.K. Jemisin on my list. </p> <p>P.S. Please do NOT recommend me The Daevabad Trilogy by S.A. Chakraborty.

Today, I have finished watching the LotR trilogy for the first time ( never completely watched the movies before, just the Hobbit), and while I&#39;ve never felt a desire to read the books, it did spark a very specific reading mood in me. It has been ages since I last read a fantasy book with more &quot;classic&quot; elements I&#39;d say... like wizards, fighting scenes, a bunch of weird/lonely/brave and a bit broken people finding family in each other and a &quot;Let&#39;s go on a quest!&quot; energy. Adult fiction, preferably lots of worldbuilding and no SA or incest (I keep getting &quot;surprised&quot; with it in books). Thanks in advance! </p> <p>By &quot;classic&quot; I don&#39;t necessarily mean books from the 80/90s or before, just those elements I mentioned above. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/carol_brrrrrrrru\"> /u/carol_brrrrrrrru </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www",

The only other thing I have read that has the same vibe is a manga series called Kami-sama hajimemashita. </p> <p>I&#39;m looking for recommendations of an Asian inspired world that is in the mythological world or mythological adjacent to the mortal world. It has two main characters. Boy and girl. Who pine for each other but it isn&#39;t the main point of the story. Like it is a slow burn but the more important part is the journey or task they have to do. It&#39;s even better if there is a duo pov between the two but not a must. I just want that journey to also be cute. I don&#39;t really like romance especially not in my fantasy books but I really enjoyed that tit-for-tat of saving each other from periless situations. </p> <p>Anot",

Armor that should be impossibly heavy but it is making the user stronger and empowering them instead of slowing them down. Or have the magic be embued into items like armor, instead of being channeled, let&#39;s say a shield or a helmet that does something magical.</p> <p>I keep thinking it&#39;s just out of reach, something like a battle mage or warhammer 40k suits of armor.</p> <p>A story that&#39;s full of action and adventure, not so much romance.

Today, I have finished watching the LotR trilogy for the first time (the extended version, never completely watched the movies before, just the Hobbit), and while I&#39;ve never felt a desire to read the books, it did spark a very specific reading mood in me. It has been ages since I last read a fantasy book with &quot;classic&quot; vibes I&#39;d say... like wizards, fighting scenes, a bunch of weird/lonely/brave and a bit broken people finding family in each other and a &quot;Let&#39;s go on a quest!&quot; energy. Adults only, preferably lots of worldbuilding, weel developed/wholesome friendships and very little to no romance (also, no SA or incest (I keep getting &quot;surprised&quot; with it in books)).
