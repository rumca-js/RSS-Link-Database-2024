First, be practical: \u201cMost people have a single oven, so you don\u2019t want five dishes that need to go in there,\u201d says Phil King, executive chef of <a href=\"https://www.pophamsbakery.com/\">Pophams</a> in London. \u201cWhen I\u2019m thinking of a menu, I want one dish that cooks in the oven, one on the stove and one that can be served at an ambient temperature, such as braised leeks.\u201d Otherwise, favour things that like a rest, whether that\u2019s a joint of meat (\u201ccover with foil and a tea towel and leave for an hour\u201d) or a veggie wellington (\u201cthat will sit comfortably for 30 minutes\u201d). And remember, snacks are golden: \u201cThat\u2019s anything you don\u2019t have to prepare yourself,\u201d notes King, be it olives, crisps, nuts \u2013 anything that will keep hunger at bay.</p><p>Menu dec",
