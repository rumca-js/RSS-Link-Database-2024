(And it was bandied about a lot!)\u00a0So I was careful on a recent call attended by about 250 engineers to preface the AI portion of the discussion with, \u201cI know this will make you cringe, but\u2026\u201d That got a lot of knowing laughs and thumbs-up emojis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What\u2019s going on here? It\u2019s not that these developers and engineers are against the use of AI; it\u2019s that they are tired of hearing about artificial intelligence as a panacea without pragmatism. They want to hear about how they can pragmatically and easily harness it \u2014 now \u2014 for real-life use cases.\u00a0</p>\n",
