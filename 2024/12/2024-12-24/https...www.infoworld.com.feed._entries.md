<p>At a developers conference I attended not too long ago, attendees did little to hide their disdain every time the term “AI” was bandied about. (And it was bandied about a lot!) So I was careful on a recent call attended by about 250 engineers to preface the AI portion of the discussion with, “I know this will make you cringe, but…” That got a lot of knowing laughs and thumbs-up emojis.</p>



<p>What’s going on here? It’s not that these developers and engineers are against the use of AI; it’s that they are tired of hearing about artificial intelligence as a panacea without pragmatism. They want to hear about how they can pragmatically and easily harness it — now — for real-life use cases. </p>
