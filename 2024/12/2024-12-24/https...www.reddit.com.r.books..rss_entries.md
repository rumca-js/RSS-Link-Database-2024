<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I read “Between the Shadow and the Soul” by Lauren Groff, and it’s a wonderful story. The prose is great, she does a phenomenal job of creating tension, and the suspense kept me glued to my screen until the end. I’m having a hard time interpreting the story, and I’d like to hear some other opinions on the story to see if I’m understanding the subtleties of the story correctly. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/who_is_jimmy_fallon"> /u/who_is_jimmy_fallon </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hlo1aq/has_anyone_read_the_new_yorkers_december_fiction/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hlo1aq/has_anyone_read_the_new_yorkers_december_fiction/">[comments]</a></span>

## If you read a book by an author and did not like it, do you read other books by the same author?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have a couple authors on my list that I won’t read again. I’m wondering if I’m alone in that? It’s usually the first book I’ve read by an author, and not like the fifth and I stop, so I admittedly don’t go very far in these writers journeys because it’s like it leaves a bad taste and I won’t read anything else of theirs. Sometimes I feel like I’m missing out because other books sound good, but I can’t bring myself to read anything else because life’s too short to read books you don’t enjoy. So do you all read books by an author if you didn’t enjoy the first one you’ve read of theirs? Do you give them a second chance?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/uslope"> /u/uslope </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hlnqiq/if_you_read_a_book_by_an_author_and_did_not_like/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hlnqiq/if_you_read_a_book_

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I read and loved both Anxious People and A Man Called Ove (the only ones I have heard/seen people talk about) by Fredrik Blackman, but this one may be my favorite. It so perfectly captures youth, loss, and family. I felt I was in a bit of a slump before I picked this book up. It winds up fantasy and reality in a way so beautiful and childlike. It is full of whimsy and hope. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Jade4827"> /u/Jade4827 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hlnq02/my_grandmother_asked_me_to_tell_you_shes_sorry/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hlnq02/my_grandmother_asked_me_to_tell_you_shes_sorry/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I just finished reading The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, and it was so different from what I expected. Going in, I thought it would be a funny, lighthearted book, but it turned out to be a deeper exploration of family, truth, and relationships.</p> <p>When I started reading, I thought the book is going to be about the mystery of Wellington the dog’s death, but the book quickly became more about Christopher’s world and how he experiences it. His logical, orderly way of thinking was fascinating—he needs everything to be in its place, and his straightforward nature made the narrative unique. I never expected to dive into his personal journey and his struggle with trust and honesty.</p> <p>One of the most striking parts of the book for me was Christopher’s relationship with his father. Despite the father&#39;s mistakes—like hiding the truth about Christopher’s mother and even killing the dog—I found myself sympathizing with him. His act

## Pro tip: watch the movie/tv show first. Then read the book.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I got this advice from a coworker when I was working at Barnes and Nobles. At first I was taken aback by the advice, the book is almost always better! But that is the point. </p> <p>Have you ever had a book you love turned into a terrible movie or tv show? You hate watch because you love the book but come away disappointed. Now imagine if you did it in reverse. You watch an okayish/passable movie or show and then you get to enjoy a great book.</p> <p>Doing it this way you almost always end up with a deeper understanding of the story/characters, get more plot and more detail. </p> <p>Is there a chance for spoilers? Absolutely, and if that’s not your bag then this advice isn’t for you. However, I feel that spoilers can actually improve the experience. You’re more attuned to foreshadowing and know what to pay attention to. </p> <p>Then there is also the chance that the adaption is just a fun movie with the same characters but no real connection to the o

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><strong>There&#39;s more to Richard Connell than just his best-known story &quot;A Dangerous Game&quot;!</strong></p> <p>American writer Richard Connell (1893–1949) is best known for his classic short story, &quot;The Most Dangerous Game.&quot; That particular work has been frequently anthologized and is highly regarded for good reasons. It is a tense tale where a hunter becomes the prey for a sadistic man on a deserted island, and must use all his wits to survive.</p> <p>But Connell was a very versatile writer who also wrote screenplays, novels, journalism articles, as well as many other excellent short stories. While &quot;A Dangerous Game&quot; is more of an adventure/suspense story, many of Connell&#39;s other short stories full into the category of wit, satire, and humour, and these I especially enjoyed. Some of my favourite short stories by Connell that I can recommend:</p> <p>Adventure/Mystery genre</p> <ul> <li>Dangerous Game: A hunter gets s
