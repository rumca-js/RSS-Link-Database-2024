<p>I have been working in the IT industry for over 30 years, for most of this time as an editor at PC-WELT (PCWorld’s German sister publication), specializing in security. I test <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407277/best-antivirus-for-windows-pc.html">antivirus software</a>, give tips on how to make Windows more secure, am constantly on the lookout for the best security tools, and monitor the activities of cyber criminals.</p>



<p>Over the years, I have acquired a whole range of behaviors and principles that seem completely normal and sensible to me. However, when I observe other PC users, I often discover risky or at least less security-oriented behavior. </p>



<p>That’s why I’ve put together the 10 most important things I would never do as an IT security expert, with tips on what to do instead.</p>

<p>Countless cables are used in the home — whether for charging smartphones, transferring data, or connecting audio systems. However, frequent use and regular bending can quickly lead to unsightly kinks or even damage to sensitive areas.</p>



<p>Caution is advised in the event of serious damage, such as a broken or exposed cable core: Repairs in such cases should be left to experienced users. For non-experts, replacing the cable is usually the safer option.</p>



<p>In other cases, however, anyone can attempt an uncomplicated repair: If the cables are only kinked or the sheath is broken, damaged household cables can be quickly repaired. </p>



<p>Find out here how you can easily repair kinked or broken cables — and even repair-damaged cable cores (conductors).</p>

<p>Picture this: You receive an audio message from your sister. She says she’s lost her wallet and asks if you can send some cash so she can pay a bill on time.</p>



<p>You’re scrolling through social media. A video appears from a celebrity you follow. In it, they ask for contributions toward their latest project. </p>



<p>You receive a video of yourself, showing you in a physically intimate situation.</p>



<p>Just a few years ago, these situations would be likely genuine. But now, thanks to artificial intelligence, a scammer could be contacting you and if you don’t have the ability to tell real from fake, you may easily fall for a plea for cash or a blackmail threat.</p>



<p>For 2025, experts are sounding the alarm about AI and its effect on online security. The technology is supercharging the speed and sophistication of attacks—and in particular, it

<p>In this yearly penultimate episode of The Full Nerd, Brad Chacos, Alaina Yee, Adam Patrick Murray, and Will Smith came ready to <em>brawl</em>. Picking the best PC hardware of the year is no easy task, especially in a year that proved momentous for the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/future-tech">future of computing</a>.</p>



<p>Heck, we couldn’t even agree on a shared of definition of what “best” means – <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-LB-4558">you know it when you see it </a>— but each participant brought his or her own picks for the best PC hardware and trends of 2023 before we all hashed out a single winner in each category. Sometimes it was painful. It was always fun. But considering how long it took to pick winners, it’s probably best that we streamlined categories a bit this year.</p>

<p>My colleague and co-conspirator Gordon Mah Ung passed away this weekend, after a battle with cancer.</p>



<p>I’m heartbroken. Gordon is the journalist <em>and </em>the person I want to be when I grow up.</p>



<p>But you can read about why in <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2564783/gordon-mah-ung-remembered.html">PCWorld’s obituary for Gordon</a>. <em>I’m</em> here to celebrate my friend of 15 years, so instead I want to talk about my favorite Full Nerd episode—which isn’t even a Full Nerd episode at all. Instead, it’s a 2017 episode of CES After Dark, which, in this case, had a Full Nerd mission and 100 percent more liquor.</p>



<p>Every night of that CES six years ago, a duo of journalists from our editorial team streamed from a couch in a Vegas hotel room, interviewed by our then-video lead, Tyler Larsen, who was dressed to the nines in a
