Over the last several months, I&#39;ve started intensive treatment, so have been hyper focused on my health and little else.

I&#39;m not looking for psychological horror as much just bc it tends to make me feel more icky than straight up gratuity does and im trying to crawl back out of a reading slump. I tried Mexican Gothic by Sylvia Moreno and while I liked it, it just didn&#39;t scratch that same itch for me. I particularly love the gayness in Brite&#39;s work, and i feel like maybe reading another trans author might help? I love Cailtlin Kiernan&#39;s prose for a similar reason as Brite&#39;s, but it often doesnt have that same level of violence and real fear that his books have (Exquisite Corpse, and Drawing Blood are my top 2) i recognize that this might be kinda specific but i figured id just throw this out into the internet void to see if anyon",
