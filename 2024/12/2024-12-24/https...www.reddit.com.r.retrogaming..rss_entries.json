I managed to find it and the 2nd one, but one is like 5 .ima files, which i have no idea how to mount on mac.</p> <p>The other is a folder with a whole bunch a files. It has an INSTALLATION.exe file, but for some reason wine on my mac partition wouldn&#39;t do anything with it. </p> <p>Can anyone help me get these two working?

As someone born in the \u201880s, even though I\u2019m not from a religious family, my parents would still make some efforts getting us (me and my brother) a game or some cash to go buy a game. </p> <p>I\u2019m wondering if anyone knows how this is done in Japan during the console era of \u201880s and \u201890s, since Japan doesn\u2019t celebrate Christmas as far as I know, and yet the video game market was dominated by Nintendo / Sega / Sony. In other words, kids born in \u201880/\u201890s in Japan, do they also have their fondest memories with Christmas as they\u2019ll were also receiving gifts like us? If not, is there any equivalent occasion as in countries that celebrate Christmas? </p> <p>I\u2019m genuinely curious about this, so don\u2019t mean to exclude anyone due to age, religion or country of residence.<",
