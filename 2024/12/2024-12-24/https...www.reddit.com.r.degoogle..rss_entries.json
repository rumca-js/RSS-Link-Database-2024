I\u2019ve been using Mull for the past six months and was honestly shocked to hear it won\u2019t be maintained anymore. It\u2019s such a great browser, and I feel like it\u2019d be a waste to let it just die.</p> <p>So, I\u2019m thinking about forking it to keep it alive. Of course, this isn\u2019t something I can pull off alone\u2014it\u2019s going to take a lot of time, effort, and the right skills. That\u2019s why I\u2019m looking for others who care about this project and want to help out.
