<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sure there&#39;s something basic I&#39;m overlooking here, but I&#39;ve just upgraded to a new VPN-enabled home router. My Pi is wired directly into it, so I was expecting literally no issues at all, but no matter what I try, I&#39;m getting an &quot;ERR_ADDRESS_UNREACHABLE&quot; error in Chromium. I also can&#39;t update nor do anything else needing internet connectivity via Terminal. I had Nord running on the Pi, so I disconnected (since I thought maybe VPN through VPN might be affecting it), but nothing, then just uninstalled Nord since I don&#39;t really need it. I also tried connecting over the wireless network vs just wired and still nothing. Everything else connecting to the router is working without issue. What am I missing here? Anyone have experience setting up their Pi behind a VPN&#39;d router?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/zaxonortesus"> /u/zaxonortesus </a> <br/> <span><a

The logic should be simple enough to program and costs are not really an issue with all options being just a couple of bucks. The Pico has more IO available and may offers functionality that may be usable down the line.

With limited space and development time, my plan is to use a Raspberry Pi 4 CM to serve this purpose. However, there is only one PCIe x2 line available on the RP4 CM.</p> <p><strong>Current Solution</strong></p> <p>My current solution is to split the PCIe line into two using a PCIe Switch (TDS4A212MX). One PCIe line will serve the USB 3.0 Host Device (TUSB7320), and the other will connect to an M.2 SSD (SATA).</p> <p><strong>My questions</strong></p> <ol> <li><p>Is there any fault with my approach? If so, could you suggest an alternative?</p></li> <li><p>How can I properly switch between PCIe x1 lines using the PCIe switch so that no data is lost? So far, I have not encountered any documentation that addresses this.</p></li> <li><p>How should I properly terminate unused USB 3.0 ports? This is not mentioned in the data
