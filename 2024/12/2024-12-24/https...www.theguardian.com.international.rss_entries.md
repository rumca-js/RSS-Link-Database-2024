<p>Take it easy between Christmas and New Year with pre-prepped dishes and the joys of soup, says our panel of practical wizards</p><p>There’s a knack to feeding a crowd, so before we talk specific dishes, let’s nail down a few golden rules. First, be practical: “Most people have a single oven, so you don’t want five dishes that need to go in there,” says Phil King, executive chef of <a href="https://www.pophamsbakery.com/">Pophams</a> in London. “When I’m thinking of a menu, I want one dish that cooks in the oven, one on the stove and one that can be served at an ambient temperature, such as braised leeks.” Otherwise, favour things that like a rest, whether that’s a joint of meat (“cover with foil and a tea towel and leave for an hour”) or a veggie wellington (“that will sit comfortably for 30 minutes”). And remember, snacks are golden: “That’s anything you don’t have to prepare yourself,” notes King, be it olives, crisps, nuts – anything that will keep hunger at bay.</p><p>Menu dec

<p>The new direct daytime route, via Strasbourg, sweeps through enchanting landscapes from vineyards to forests. But some say it needs to be quicker still if the train is to be more attractive than flying</p><p>Until last week, my most recent trip from Paris to Berlin on a direct daytime train was way back in early 2015 with RZD Russian Railways. The train had a Polish restaurant car with a quirky menu featuring caviar, kangaroo steak and South African wines. The journey between the two capital cities was scheduled to take 13 hours, and despite dawdling along the way, we arrived in Berlin bang on time. It was a day with breakfast by the Seine, lunch (without caviar) on the train as we crossed the Rhine and nightcaps by the Spree in Berlin.</p><p>More recently, the only direct service between Paris and Berlin has been a thrice-weekly overnight train. Branded as a Nightjet, there is nothing jet-like about it. It takes even longer than the Russian daytime train did 10 years ago. But as
