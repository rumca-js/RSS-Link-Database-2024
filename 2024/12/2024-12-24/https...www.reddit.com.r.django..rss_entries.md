<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am working as a Django developer in a company, but i havent seen enough django requirements in this region. I fear it will be difficult for me to switch jobs or even have part time job (i am actively looking for some remote or part time jobs but i am unable to find one ). I have been a django developer since 5 years and i know in and out of the framework. I have built many applications with django and they work perfectly. But due to non availability of jobs, i am losing motivation. Is this a region based issue or django is being obsolete by time ? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/aliasgar1099"> /u/aliasgar1099 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/1hlip2l/is_django_obsolete/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/1hlip2l/is_django_obsolete/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello, </p> <p>I built a web app (rn local only) for professional (job/work related) purposes to help my friend as a marketer/ writer (he writes for different companies and manages that stuff on his laptop as a local machine). Now some of his friends want to try it out, and it will be too much work to help them run in their local server with a virtual environment. I also want to try and scale it out if it works.</p> <p>I have another simple project in Django that helps manage funding, source of funding, etc., and other personal user data. </p> <p>Now the issue is I want to make sure I as a super admin or admin, or the server owner (or as a developer) don&#39;t have access to any of the writings or work they have saved in that system or server.</p> <p>How can I achieve that in Django? </p> <p>I was thinking of using their username (only one username for each user) to generate a mnemonic for that user and encrypt and decrypt their data when they log in
