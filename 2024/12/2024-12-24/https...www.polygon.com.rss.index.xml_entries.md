<p>The <strong>Great League</strong> is the perfect place to start dabbling in Go Battle League if you haven’t tried competitive battling yet in <em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-go-guide">Pokémon Go</a></em>.</p>

<p>While the other leagues have their thrills, they can get bogged down with rare Legendary Pokémon, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-go-guide/22446035/xl-candy-walking-buddy-transfer-unlock-trade-level">XL Candy</a> requirements, and a lot of Community Day exclusive moves. </p>

<p>Great League is the nearest thing <em>Pokémon Go </em>has to a level playing field, and while it still has its quibbles, it is a great place to learn the competi

<p>The <strong>Ultra League</strong> in <em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-go-guide">Pokémon Go</a></em>’s Go Battle League and its 2,500 CP limit is where more “regular” Pokémon have their time in the spotlight, compared to the almost Legendary-dominated <a href="https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-go-guide/497479/master-league-best-team-meta">Master League</a> and lower levels of the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/e/500388">Great League</a>.</p>

<p>In this League, every Pokémon has a chance to make a splash — but that’s not to say there are some strong team recommendations to make, and some genuine strategy to be had.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap has-text-align-none">If you’ve ever complained about the dominance of digital special effects in modern Hollywood movies, <em>Werewolves </em>was made for you. The new action-horror movie, now available for digital rental or purchase, has a delicious premise — a year ago, a supermoon turned a billion people into werewolves for one night. Now, it’s about to happen again, and it’s up to the most jacked molecular biologist in the world (Frank Grillo) to stop it. It also relies almost entirely on practical werewolf effects, crafted with great care.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Count Orlok looms over <em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/review/500504/nosferatu-2024-robert-eggers-remake">Nosferatu</a></em> like the Cloverfield monster. While he is among the first voices we hear, and the first faces we see, the full reveal of Orlok’s form comes much later. When we see him in all his glory — with all the sores, sylphlike limbs, and ponderous movements — he looks like a reanimated corpse. Bill Skarsgård’s mannerisms mark a striking difference from the comparatively youthful (and alive) Ellen, played by Lily-Rose Depp.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Over the last 20 years, Peter Jackson’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/year-of-the-ring">Lord of the Rings trilogy</a> has been enshrined as a wintertime favorite by those craving spectacle and a cozy time on the couch. We can (<a href="https://www.polygon.com/lord-of-the-rings/22800515/lord-of-the-rings-movies-watch-thanksgiving-christmas-marathon">and have!</a>) debated if the films are best served by one holiday or another, but every fantasy nut seems to agree: The mix of Misty Mountains snow and an undying flicker of hope for a brighter future is a cure for the winter blues.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One of my favorite things about YouTube is discovering a channel that has this one stellar video unlike anything else they’ve done. Bill Wurtz’s “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mh5LY4Mz15o&amp;ab_channel=billwurtz">history of japan</a>” is a classic example, the 80 million-view juggernaut from a channel that typically posts bite-sized neon surrealist animations. But I’d like to turn your attention to <em>another</em> absurdist video from a creator who doesn’t <em>usually</em> do stuff like this, that <em>also</em> has a uniquely colorful visual style. It’s about birds.</p>
