And because I&#39;m using Termux as test environment for my programs I can&#39;t figure out how to setup ngrok or local host. See my other posts on my profile as reference if it helps.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/FK_GAMES"> /u/FK_GAMES </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1hlgqiq/problem_with_serveo/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1hlgqiq/problem_with_serveo/">[comments]</a></span>
