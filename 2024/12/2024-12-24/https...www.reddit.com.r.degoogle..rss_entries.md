<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone,</p> <p>As you might know, the Mull browser along with the whole DivestOS project have been discontinued. I’ve been using Mull for the past six months and was honestly shocked to hear it won’t be maintained anymore. It’s such a great browser, and I feel like it’d be a waste to let it just die.</p> <p>So, I’m thinking about forking it to keep it alive. Of course, this isn’t something I can pull off alone—it’s going to take a lot of time, effort, and the right skills. That’s why I’m looking for others who care about this project and want to help out. If you’re interested, leave a commemt!</p> <p>And hey, Merry Christmas!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Core-i5_4590"> /u/Core-i5_4590 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/degoogle/comments/1hlnb8z/forking_mull_help_wanted/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/degoogle/comments/1hlnb8z/forking_mull

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I recently bought tickets to a sporting event. Exact delivery of tickets are unknown until after purchase. In the past I was able to download a PDF or provided a web link with a constantly changing QR as my ticket. My last pair of tickets it seems transferring them to a Google Wallet was the only option. I know little about wallets and their workings. Are there other options? I do have Catima, but that just seems to be a QR/Bar code storage. Do I have any options here other than refusing tickets that require Google Wallet?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/MrTooToo"> /u/MrTooToo </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/degoogle/comments/1hlj6aj/is_google_wallet_mandatory_or_do_i_have_options/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/degoogle/comments/1hlj6aj/is_google_wallet_mandatory_or_do_i_have_options/">[comments]</a></span>
