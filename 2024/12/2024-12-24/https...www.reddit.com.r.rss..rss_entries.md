<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>TL:DR: I&#39;m fairly new to this RSS thing. And I need an RSS that gives feeds with an XML format.</p> <p>I&#39;m looking for an RSS feed generator, preferably free of charge, whose output would serve as the 1st step in an automation scenario on <a href="http://make.com">make.com</a>. I think <a href="http://rss.app">rss.app</a> is great but they only give you a 7-day trial (I considered paying for the most basic plan but I think it&#39;s not worth it for my case), I tried stuff like Raven but it doesn&#39;t generate XML file, so it can&#39;t give me the result I need.</p> <p>P.S: I have Windows 11 and Ubuntu Linux, i preferably want to stay on Win11 for now.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi <a href="/r/rss">r/rss</a>! 👋</p> <p>I wanted to share InReader - a modern take on Google Reader that combines keyboard-driven with AI features and a unique social sharing system. </p> <p><strong>Why Another RSS Reader?</strong></p> <p>I missed Google Reader&#39;s efficiency and social features but wanted to add modern features like AI summaries and decentralized social sharing (for longevity, no point of failure if a server is down) while keeping everything inside the reader. The goal was to maximize the bandwidth of RSS information to my brain (in a way that can&#39;t be taken away like Google Reader was).</p> <p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p> <ul> <li>🎯 Vim-style keyboard navigation (j/k/h/l) - just like the good old days</li> <li>📰 Full article extraction - stay in the reader without opening tabs</li> <li>🤖 Local AI summaries and chat (via Ollama - no data sent to the cloud!)</li> <li>🌐 Decentralized social sharing (p2p via Gun.js - no cen
