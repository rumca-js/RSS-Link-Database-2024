One limitation is that the only options are free fonts\u2009\u2014\u2009some of my favorite monospaced fonts aren\u2019t free and thus aren\u2019t included (e.g. <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/font-list/consolas\">Consolas</a>,  <a href=\"https://berkeleygraphics.com/typefaces/berkeley-mono/\">Berkeley Mono</a>, or Apple\u2019s <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/fonts/\">SF Mono</a>). Another limitation is that some of the fonts in the tournament just plain suck. But it\u2019s really pretty fun.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s also a good thing I procrastinated on linking to this for ",
