<p><a href="https://sixcolors.com/link/2024/10/choose-your-coding-font/">Via Jason Snell</a> (back in October), who points first to <a href="https://mastodon.social/@antonyjohnston/113357094105351691#.">this thread on Mastodon</a> where a few of us posted about our preferences for the fonts we use for writing, and then describes this fun “tournament” from Typogram that lets you pick your favorite monospaced coding font from 32 choices. One limitation is that the only options are free fonts — some of my favorite monospaced fonts aren’t free and thus aren’t included (e.g. <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/font-list/consolas">Consolas</a>,  <a href="https://berkeleygraphics.com/typefaces/berkeley-mono/">Berkeley Mono</a>, or Apple’s <a href="https://developer.apple.com/fonts/">SF Mono</a>). Another limitation is that some of the fonts in the tournament just plain suck. But it’s really pretty fun.</p>

<p>Thrice a week, I pay for my son’s tuition. Once, I forgot, and the tutor had to ask for it days later. I felt terrible for making him ask. After putting it in Due, awkward moments like that never happened again.</p>

<p>If keeping promises, meeting deadlines, and showing up on time matter to you as much as they do to me, <a href="https://dueapp.com/">Due</a> might be the app for you.</p>

<p>PS: It’s been 14 years since I first made Due. But my journey <a href="https://dueapp.com/blog/three-sentence-review.html">would have ended abruptly</a> if not for a three-sentence review on Daring Fireball. If you were one of those readers who took a chance on Due, thank you.</p>
