This is in the aftermath of a Tennessee state law that was passed preventing the trans-ing of the kids. People are saying this law violates the 14th Amendment. Ben details the recording released from the Supreme Court hearing, where the argument is made that this law is not protected under the 14th Amendment. He talks about how this is all a power game with the left because they want everyone to abide by a false construction of reality.\n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Click here to join the member-exclusive portion of my show: https://bit.ly/3WDjgHE\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Our largest sale of the year is live NOW!
