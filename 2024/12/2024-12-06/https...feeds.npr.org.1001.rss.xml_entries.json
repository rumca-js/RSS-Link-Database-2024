Assad has managed to stay in power throughout the civil war that has engulfed his country for more than a decade. But he again finds himself in a precarious position. We weigh the chances of his political survival.  <br><br>And in Lebanon, residents are watching as Syrian rebels get closer and closer to their border. There is concern that the fighting will spill over, threatening a fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah and perhaps becoming a regional war.",
