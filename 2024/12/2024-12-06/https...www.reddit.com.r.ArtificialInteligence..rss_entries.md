<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m searching for an AI tool or service that can translate YouTube videos longer than 1 hour, specifically from English to Spanish. I don’t necessarily need an all-in-one tool that does everything—just a good translator is fine. I’ve tried Chrome extensions, but none seem to translate accurately. Most tools I’ve found (even paid ones) limit translations to 30-minute videos, and cutting videos into parts is too much work for my needs. Any recommendations for tools or workflows that handle long video translations effectively? Paid options are fine as long as they get the job done.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/disguisedspybot"> /u/disguisedspybot </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1h8f3na/need_an_ai_translator_for_long_youtube_videos_1/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1h8f3na/need_an

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been doing some thinking and deep diving into AI research and came across a fascinating concept called &#39;relational intelligence.&#39; Here&#39;s what it&#39;s all about:</p> <p>Most people think of AI as just number-crunching machines, but I&#39;m fascinated by the potential for a more nuanced form of intelligence. Relational intelligence is more than AI mimicking human consciousness - it&#39;s about crafting systems that adapt to and genuinely understand context.</p> <p>Imagine AI that doesn&#39;t just respond mechanically, but actually synthesizes information dynamically. Think of it as the difference between a simple calculator and a conversation partner who actually gets the nuances of what you&#39;re saying. In fields like healthcare, education, and customer service, this could be revolutionary - systems that genuinely understand the complexity of human needs.</p> <p>We&#39;re not trying to create human-like consciousness, but somet

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been obsessed with MilkDrop for a long time. Several years ago I curated through all 52,000 presets, selected the very best presets, and then organized them into categories and subcategories. So I&#39;ve been curious if an LLM could be fine-tuned on this dataset and then generate new presets. When the Qwen-Coder-7b-Instuct model was released, it seemed like the open-source models have matured to the point that it&#39;s worth trying out. So I teamed up a InferenceIllusionist and started doing some fine-tuning experiments of the model. The results have been exciting to play with and so we&#39;ve released the model for anyone to experiment with.</p> <p><a href="https://huggingface.co/InferenceIllusionist/MilkDropLM-7b-v0.3">https://huggingface.co/InferenceIllusionist/MilkDropLM-7b-v0.3</a></p> <p>What is MilkDrop?

## Has ChatGPT turned into total garbage? Need alternative AI for text extraction

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I do not get frustrated very often, but ever since they upgraded the version to include searching online, ChatGPT has become less effective. Yesterday for 2 hours I am banging my head, about to throw my keyboard because ChatGPT could not correctly extract text and sort it. It was making stuff up, putting names that didn&#39;t belong. Tried again today with another document. No better. OpenAI wants to charge $200 for AI that checks its own work? WTF am I paying $30 for then? </p> <p>So I&#39;m done. I need a new AI. Something that can extract text from pdf files and put it into a table so I can copy it into an excel document. I am dealing with a disability, and I am using AI to help me appeal a denied medical insurance claim. ChatGPT has been useful for summarizing 500 pages, and helping me cross reference policies, and write letters, so its found a place in my heart because it has helped a lot - but my mental health is taking a toll from what I&#39;m

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am brand new to using AI. I have used Chat GPT a handful of times to ask some questions but that is the extent that I have used AI. I work in the music industry, specifically in live events/concert production. This week I attended a conference and one of the panels I attended today was about using technology to streamline workflow.</p> <p>The first 50 minutes of this panel was pretty uninformative to me, and I considered leaving but the last 10 minutes were gold to me. The speakers started rattling off AI tech they use to streamline the work. One of them was Otter for taking notes during zoom meetings, this will be a game changer for me. The other was an email program called Superhuman that also sounded neat. I have a few things that I think I can make AI do, but don&#39;t know where to start. Below are two of the things, and if anyone here could point me in the right direction that would be awesome!</p> <p>1) I read through a lot of PDFs with tech
