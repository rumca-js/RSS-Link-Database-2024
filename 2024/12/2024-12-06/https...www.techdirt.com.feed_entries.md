To anyone who listened to the oral arguments in the DC Circuit regarding the TikTok ban bill, it perhaps wasn&#8217;t a huge surprise that the DC Circuit today ruled to uphold the ban, but the resulting opinion is incredibly troubling. In a stunning and dangerous decision, the court argued that banning TikTok somehow vindicates and [&#8230;]

Civil asset forfeiture has never been about dismantling criminal operations. It has always been about immediately enriching those who directly benefit from every dollar seized under the pretense that taking cash away from random people somehow cripples multi-national drug operations that have both the personnel and the cash on hand to survive these small-ish seizures.

In a disturbing (if unsurprising) trend, Republican FCC and FTC commissioners are deliberately misusing &#8220;free speech&#8221; rhetoric in an Orwellian attempt to justify government intervention to control and suppress online speech. Last week, FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr pushed censorial policies in the name of &#8220;free speech.&#8221; This week, GOP FTC Commissioners Melissa Holyoak and Andrew [&#8230;]

We&#8217;ve noted for decades how the U.S. broadband sector is a mess thanks to corruption and unchecked monopoly power working tirelessly to undermine U.S. telecom competition. The result is high prices, spotty access, slow speeds, and comically terrible customer service. Another way to put it is market failure. Caused by regulatory capture. In direct response, [&#8230;]

It was only a few weeks ago that we discussed Good Old Games&#8217; (GOG) return to its roots with the site&#8217;s &#8220;GOG Preservation Program&#8221;. While GOG never stopped selling, you know, good old games, the site also expanded over the years to be a storefront for new releases and AAA games as well. But with [&#8230;]

I&#8217;ve been doing this for more than 10 years and I can assure I have yet to read a DOJ civil rights investigation report that has concluded everything looks pretty OK at this cop shop.
