<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve just signed up to Eweka and it recommended I use NewsLazer which I am doing. Have also signed up for a trial of NZBGeek. I do like the GUI for NZBGeek but other than that is there any difference when it comes to search results? any other benefits to using a paid indexer? </p> <p>Will I need it to set up all the arrs? Ultimately that&#39;s what I plan to do, just getting a feel for Usenet at the moment.</p> <p>Thanks.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/6omph9"> /u/6omph9 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1h7y12s/indexer_question/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1h7y12s/indexer_question/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have a 6GB file I want to make a 100% recovery file set for. I keep getting the &quot;could not allocate output buffer&quot; failure message. I&#39;ve tried a smaller number of source blocks making the block size high and vice versa, I&#39;ve also tried all the recovery file size options. I don&#39;t want to split the file and I want 100% redundancy is this possible with par2? If so what am I doing wrong? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/1amtheknight"> /u/1amtheknight </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1h7ogvk/quickpar_limitations/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1h7ogvk/quickpar_limitations/">[comments]</a></span>
