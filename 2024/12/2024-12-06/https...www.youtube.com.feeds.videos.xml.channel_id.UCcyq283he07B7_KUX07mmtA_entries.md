UKEF is a UK government ministerial department and the nation’s export credit agency. UKEF helps exporters access working capital and manage the risk of not getting paid by offering a government guarantee. It supports companies of all sizes and multiple sectors across the UK. With the help of UKEF’s tailored support, Premier Ship Models has evolved into a thriving B2B enterprise with a global corporate client base. Rashid details how UKEF’s assistance was pivotal in securing significant deals, such as a complex project in Oman requiring financial guarantees. He also emphasizes UKEF’s dedication to supporting businesses from under-represented communities, making export opportunities accessible to all.
