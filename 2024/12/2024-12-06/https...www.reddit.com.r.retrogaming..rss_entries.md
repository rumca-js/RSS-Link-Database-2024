## Being a video games lover in the 90s in a midclass family meant owning games was hard. But the day i got the SUPERVISION 16 in 1, was simply the best day of my young life.

It&#39;s been about 40 years, so I can&#39;t remember many details, but it was about running from ghosts in a maze, kind of like Pac Man. I had a lot of fun with it as a kid, so I was a little disappointed that I couldn&#39;t find it. Maybe I&#39;m misremembering the name, but I&#39;m sure that I&#39;m not just imagining it.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Spoiler warning for the ending of the NES Batman movie tie-in game.</p> <p>I used to love this game as a kid so I watched a play through on YouTube. It was just as I remembered but for one key detail. I remember fighting the Joker at the end and when I would punch him he would fly backwards. I remembering punching and punching and being frustrated that I wasn’t beating him, then realizing the goal was to punch him all the way to the far right where there was a ledge he would fall off and fall to his death. But in the play through I watched, it was a standard fight where you punch him until he falls down, then there was a cut scene of him falling. Is my memory false? Or were there different versions of the game with different endings? The game is otherwise just as I remember it including the soundtrack. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/emdoubleyou2"> /u/emdoubleyou2 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https

After accepting that I have to change the way I play the game and really keep the level up system in mind, it became more manageable. I think you really need to have the elbow attack before you get to the double Abobos, so that means sticking to normal punches and kicks (they give the most experience points) as much as possible. Still, the lack of continues and ability to earn extra lives is making this game a pain in the ass to beat. It is definitely not as difficult as the really difficult games on the NES, but it&#39;s not something that I think you can casually play and beat.</p> <p>What about you guys?
