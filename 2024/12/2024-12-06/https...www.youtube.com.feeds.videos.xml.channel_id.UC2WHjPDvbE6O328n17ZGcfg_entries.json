Many of which you already use, whether you realize it or not. Because simply put, they are solutions to common programming problems that appear over and over again, regardless of the language or platform you\u2019re using. That\u2019s what a design pattern is. A repeatable solution to a software engineering problem. Templates that can be applied to multiple situations.\n\nAnd back in 1994, these four developers now known as the Gang of Four, wrote this book documenting, cataloging, and formalizing 23 commonly used design patterns. So I\u2019d highly recommend reading that book, as it\u2019s still heavily applicable today.
