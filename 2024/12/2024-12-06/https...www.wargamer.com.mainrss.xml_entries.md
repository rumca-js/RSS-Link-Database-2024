								<p>On the sixth day of Christmas, Games Workshop gave to me, a horrifically busted Necron detachment. That’s right, the Starshatter Arsenal, released on December 6, is easily the best of the new advent <strong>Warhammer 40k</strong> detachments GW has put out so far, and it’s got everyone whose army wasn’t done up with a coat of metallic paint and a splash of Nuln Oil seething.</p>

								<p>In a recent poll on his Tumblr blog, <strong>Magic: The Gathering</strong> lead designer Mark Rosewater asked his followers if kithkin, the white-aligned little humanoids from Lorwyn, should become Halflings going forward. While the answer was an overwhelming “no”, with 69% of the 1,346 respondents asking for no change, I have a sneaking suspicion Wizards might have made the switch already.</p>

								<p>The <strong>Pokémon TCG Prismatic Evolutions</strong> set isn’t easy to pre-order, despite the fact it's releasing in early 2025. Elite Trainer Boxes? Gone. Booster Packs? Gone. Those snazzy-looking Suprise Boxes? You guessed it - gone. It’s an elusive set that is already earning the right to be compared with the often-scalped 151 set, but if you’re desperate, the Japanese version is still easy to get your hands on.</p>

								<p>Creating an entirely new edition of <b>Dungeons and Dragons</b> would have been easier than creating the updated 2024 rules for 5e, says D&amp;D designer Jeremy Crawford. Speaking to Wargamer at MCM London in October, Crawford says “the further we got, the more we realized it would have been easier to start from scratch”.</p>
