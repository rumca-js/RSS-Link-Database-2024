<p>While there is no subscription offering for Daring Fireball (never say never <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2004/06/something_daring">again</a>), I am <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/12/03/the-verge-launches-a-subscription">reminded</a> this week to remind you that, if you enjoy podcasts, you should subscribe to Dithering, the twice-weekly 15-minutes-on-the-button podcast I do with Ben Thompson. Dithering as a standalone subscription costs just $7/month or $70/year. People who try Dithering seem to love it, too — we have remarkably little churn.</p>

<p>Elizabeth Lopatto, writing for The Verge, “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/5/24313222/chatgpt-pardon-biden-bush-esquire">Stop Using Generative AI as a Search Engine</a>”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Now, a defender of AI might — rightly — say that a real
journalist should check the answers provided by ChatGPT; that
fact-checking is a critical part of our job. I agree, which is why
I’ve walked you through my own checking in this article. But these
are only the public and embarrassing examples of something I think
is happening much more often in private: a normal person is using
ChatGPT and trusting the information it gives them.</p>

<p>A mistake, obviously.</p>

<p>One advantage old-school Google Search has over <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/30/24230975/openai-publisher-deals-web-search">the so-called
answer engines</a> is that it links directly to primary sources.
Answer engines just give you an answer, and it’s often unclear
what the source is. For me, using Cha

<p>David Frum, writing at The Atlantic, regarding his jarring appearance as a guest on MSNBC’s <em>Morning Joe</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Before getting to the article, I was asked about the nomination of
Pete Hegseth as secretary of defense — specifically about an NBC
News <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/pete-hegseths-drinking-worried-colleagues-fox-news-sources-tell-nbc-ne-rcna181471">report</a> that his heavy drinking worried colleagues
at Fox News and at the <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/pete-hegseths-secret-history">veterans organizations</a> he’d
headed. [...] I answered by reminding viewers of some history:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In 1989, President George H. W. Bush nominated John Tower,
senator from Texas, for secretary of defense. Tower was a very
considerable person, a real defense intellectual, someone who
deeply understood defense, unlike the current nominee. It emerged
that Tower had a drinking problem, and when he was d

<p>Oliver Darcy, in a well-sourced report at Status (paywalled, alas, but with a preview of the article if you sign up for the free version of his newsletter, which I agree is sort of a “<em>Yeah, no thanks</em>” offer):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Patrick Soon-Shiong is tightening his grip over the Los Angeles Times.</p>

<p>The MAGA-curious owner, who drew controversy when he blocked the newspaper’s planned endorsement of Kamala Harris, has waded further into its operations since the November election, according to new information I have learned and public remarks the billionaire made Wednesday during a media appearance with right-wing personality Scott Jennings. The meddling has alarmed staffers, some of whom now harbor concerns that the billionaire presents an active danger to the paper they once believed he might help rescue. [...] Several veteran staffers told me that morale has never been lower, with some people even wondering whether the newspaper will be disfigured beyond recogn
