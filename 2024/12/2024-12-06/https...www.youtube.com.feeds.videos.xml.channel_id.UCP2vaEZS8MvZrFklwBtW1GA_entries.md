How to remove baseboards…I cut the silicone between the board and wall. Then I find the studs and use the mini trim puller in that location. This helps me dislodge the baseboard from the wall. The wood distributes the force against the wall and prevents drywall damage 👍🏽🔥#demo #homeremodeling #goodvibes
