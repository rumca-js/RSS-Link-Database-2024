Path of Exile 2 is more than just a follow-up with a fun new campaign, numerous enemy types, and gorgeous visuals. It's also a straight-up feast of new options for character-building and customization. The different types of Skill Gems and the gargantuan Passive Tree, enable many different ways to play. 

And best of all, the chances of bricking your build are far lower with easier respeccing and the lack of linking and recoloring sockets. Path of Exile 2 isn't flawless - there are some bugs, ranging from the annoying to the gameplay-affecting. However, make no mistake - it's the new king of action RPGs, and early access is simply the road to claiming its rightful throne.

Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is a triumph for MachineGames, Bethesda, and Xbox in every way possible, and easily the best thing this IP has produced in over three decades. 

The Great Circle feels like the true successor to the original movie. Not only does it perfectly create an authentic Indiana Jones adventure, it’s also an accomplished game in its own right, boasting chaotic combat, engaging stealth, compelling exploration, satisfying puzzles, and excellent level design. 

Without a doubt, it’s the best first-party Xbox game released in some time, while also probably being MachineGames’ best game yet- which, looking at the studio’s track record, is saying something.
