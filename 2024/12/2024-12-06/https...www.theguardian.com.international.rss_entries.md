<p><strong>White Bear theatre, London<br></strong>The former PM’s brief tenure is raked over to seriocomic effect in Greg Wilkinson’s play, which raises major political questions</p><p>A running length of 100 minutes for The Last Days of Liz Truss? amounts to about two minutes for each day its subject served as prime minister. By the same measure, a drama about Margaret Thatcher – Truss’s heroine, her portrait hanging from the set – would last almost a week. That would be a sum as untenable as those in the budget that led to a premiership of such brevity, whereas this monologue written by Greg Wilkinson enjoyably justifies its economics.</p><p>Truss’s time in the post in 2022 has already been detailed in four books including her own Ten Years to Save the West, Anthony Seldon’s Truss at No 10: How Not to Be Prime Minister, Tim Shipman’s Out and Kingmaker by Sir Graham Brady, who as chair of the 1922 committee, was the Tory executioner.

<p>Reliable character actor Margo Martindale gets the chance to lead her own show, an unfunny take on a real story</p><p>As soon as Margo Martindale walked away with the second season of Justified, it became inevitable. Her rich portrayal of the show’s second-season lead villain Mags Bennett is exactly the kind of turn that vaults a reliable character actor and veteran scene-stealer to the next level of audience awareness. It also sets into motion a more starstruck form of casting, where the performer will eventually be given the leeway and screentime to overact like crazy, based on the assumption that audiences will delight in their every outburst. Martindale was too busy, in-demand and skilled for it to happen right away, but The Sticky, a new series on Prime Video, makes up for any lost time, placing Martindale in a leading role and then having her scream, emote, swear and do that thing where a character saying another character’s name a lot is supposed to be hilarious.</p><p>Play

<p>This latest piece of modern vintage hardware from Retro Games Ltd makes for an astonishingly nostalgic experience</p><p>The first time I played on a ZX Spectrum was at the Stockport branch of Debenhams, which in 1983 had an impressive home computer section that quickly turned into a sort of free creche for bored 13-year-old boys. You could hang out there for hours, typing rude Basic programs into an array of machines while the harried staff rushed about trying to stop them running. Some of the computers, however, ran games for customers to try – and this was where I encountered Manic Miner, the legendary platformer with its strange flashing visuals and surreal enemies. Speccy games looked utterly unique thanks to the machine’s idiosyncratic way of restricting 8x8 sprite maps to two colours, which meant moving objects on screen were usually collections of coloured pixel patchworks, leading to an effect known as attribute clash. Somehow, it was both ugly and beautiful – and it still
