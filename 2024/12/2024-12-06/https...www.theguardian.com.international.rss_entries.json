Her rich portrayal of the show\u2019s second-season lead villain Mags Bennett is exactly the kind of turn that vaults a reliable character actor and veteran scene-stealer to the next level of audience awareness. It also sets into motion a more starstruck form of casting, where the performer will eventually be given the leeway and screentime to overact like crazy, based on the assumption that audiences will delight in their every outburst. Martindale was too busy, in-demand and skilled for it to happen right away, but The Sticky, a new series on Prime Video, makes up for any lost time, placing Martindale in a leading role and then having her scream, emote, swear and do that thing where a character saying another character\u2019s name a lot is supposed to be hilarious.</p><p>Play",
