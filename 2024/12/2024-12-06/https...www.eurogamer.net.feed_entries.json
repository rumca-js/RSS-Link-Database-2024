His last two films didn't quite hit the mark, and it's been even longer since a game has managed to do him justice either. It's a feeling that developer MachineGames seems acutely aware of, too, in the opening stretch of <a data-keyword=\"true\" href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-developers-super-thrilled-its-headed-to-playstation\">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>. If there was ever a need to prove the studio fully understands what makes Indy great and what he's about, then letting us play a word for word, and almost shot for shot recreation of the iconic prologue from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUWYmTpYdP4\">Raiders of the Lost Ark</a> certainly isn't the worst way to go about it.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-an",
