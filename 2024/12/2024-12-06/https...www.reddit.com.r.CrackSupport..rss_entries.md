<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Alright. I need to get this off my head. I&#39;ve been meaning to play <strong><em>Library of Ruina</em></strong> because I got a new PC, and of course, I&#39;m dirt poor and can&#39;t afford it (costs about 20-24 Euros). There are a lot of posts saying <strong>SteamRIP</strong> is safe, and <strong>Steamunlocked</strong> isn&#39;t. I have the prequel of the game, Lobotomy Corporation, bough, but not this one.</p> <p>I just want to know if SteamRIP is safe or not so I can play LoR.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I was looking to unlock the JP Decoys in EDF6 by using creaminstaller for online use while playing with my friend. It seems that when I use creaminstaller to do this, the game does not let me cream rooms nor join rooms. Is this just an impossibility to work out, or does anyone have any clue for alternatives that would allow me to aquire the JP region locked DLC on the english version of the game? Thank you.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Nikolai_The_Undying"> /u/Nikolai_The_Undying </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CrackSupport/comments/1h7uqyo/edf6_using_jp_decoys_online_using_creaminstaller/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CrackSupport/comments/1h7uqyo/edf6_using_jp_decoys_online_using_creaminstaller/">[comments]</a></span>
