<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Why will no search agent show me the video of the incredible standup routine of a kid playing the part of an old school cartoonist whose derivitive Funky-Winkerbean like fare only belatedly kicked after he posted a strip about the 9/11 attacks... published on 9/10. It&#39;s hilarious, and it IS on Youtube (don&#39;t bother). But how to find it, and WHY are search engines so intent on thwarting us?</p> <p>This is a good search string, but ... by &quot;great&quot;, I mean, &quot;totally unhelpful, seemingly by design&quot; </p> <p>My best search string might be &quot;Stand comedy cartoonist 9/11 skunky&quot;</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/DulcetTone"> /u/DulcetTone </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/searchengines/comments/1h7smfk/search_counteragents/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/searchengines/comments/1h7smfk/search_counteragents/">[comments]</a

I&#39;m currently working on integrating actual results, but I got the home page down! And it works. I&#39;m soon to host it on Netlify until I buy a domain. So far the Open Maps button opens the website for Apple Maps (but if you&#39;re on an Apple device, it opens the Maps app), the Control Center menu allows you to switch from light and dark modes and view about info, and the Maps Search actually searches things on Apple Maps for web.</p> <p>Video demo: <a href="https://streamable.com/e/7hi6nz">https://stre
