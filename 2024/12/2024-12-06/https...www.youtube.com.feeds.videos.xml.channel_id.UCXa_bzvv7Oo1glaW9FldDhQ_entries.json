        "description": "Path of Exile 2 is more than just a follow-up with a fun new campaign, numerous enemy types, and gorgeous visuals. It's also a straight-up feast of new options for character-building and customization. The different types of Skill Gems and the gargantuan Passive Tree, enable many different ways to play. \n\nAnd best of all, the chances of bricking your build are far lower with easier respeccing and the lack of linking and recoloring sockets. Path of Exile 2 isn't flawless - there are some bugs, ranging from the annoying to the gameplay-affecting. However, make no mistake - it's the new king of action RPGs, and early access is simply the road to claiming its rightful throne.",

How does the developer achieve this image quality on consoles and how does the 60fps claims stand? \n\nWith this video, we will be taking a look at just that as we break down individual aspects of the presentation along with graphical comparisons between Xbox Series X and PC.",

        "description": "Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is a triumph for MachineGames, Bethesda, and Xbox in every way possible, and easily the best thing this IP has produced in over three decades. \n\nThe Great Circle feels like the true successor to the original movie. Not only does it perfectly create an authentic Indiana Jones adventure, it\u2019s also an accomplished game in its own right, boasting chaotic combat, engaging stealth, compelling exploration, satisfying puzzles, and excellent level design. \n\nWithout a doubt, it\u2019s the best first-party Xbox game released in some time, while also probably being MachineGames\u2019 best game yet- which, looking at the studio\u2019s track record, is saying something.",
