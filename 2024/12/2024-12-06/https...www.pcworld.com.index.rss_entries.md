<p>Google is stepping up its Gemini AI rollout for smart home users, delivering access to a new Gemini-powered feature in the Google Home app. </p>



<p>Android users enrolled in Google Home’s Public Preview can now help test <a href="https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/15684131" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“Help me create,” a Gemini AI-infused tool</a> that lets you create Google Home automations from natural-language prompts. </p>



<p>Here’s how it works: You open the Google Home app, tap the Automations tab, tap Add, then tap “Help me create.” </p>



<p>Next, just describe in English (yes, just English, at least for now) what you’d like the automation to do. For example, you could type (or say) “Turn off the lights at 11 p.m. every night,” “Lock all the doors when everyone’s away,” or “Set a meditation time reminder.” </p>

<p>Microsoft is promising an AI-driven future for Windows 11—but initially, only select PC owners could try <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2375380/windows-copilot-ai-features-feel-like-early-tech-demos-at-best.html">Copilot+ features</a> as they rolled out in preview. If you didn’t own a laptop with a Snapdragon X Elite or X Plus processor, you had to wait. That changes today, with <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2024/11/22/previewing-recall-with-click-to-do-on-copilot-pcs-with-windows-insiders-in-the-dev-channel/">Microsoft’s announcement of two Copilot+ features</a> becoming available to compatible Intel and AMD PCs: Microsoft Recall and Click to Do.</p>



<p>Of the two, Microsoft Recall has greater notoriety—it captures your activity as you use your computer, taking screenshots every few seconds. Windows then leans on AI to s

<p>When your K/D tally is at stake it’s pretty tempting to buy a premium gaming mouse with all the latest bells and whistles. But that can be a costly move that can see you paying upwards of $150 USD — that’s coin that could go towards a brand-new processor instead.</p>



<p>The truth is you won’t lose much performance going for a cheaper option. In fact, you can get a top-performing mouse that — barring the sensor, which is usually more modest than in premium devices — is virtually identical in build quality and styling and with equally quick buttons.</p>



<p>That’s not to say all budget gaming mice are alike. Admittedly, at the lower end of the market there tends to be more variation in the build quality, weight, and button configuration than at the top end, so you’ll still want to do your homework before you buy.</p>

<p>I’ve been mounting my desktop PCs under my desk for years because it’s a great way to free up space and avoid cable issues, especially when you’re using a standing desk like I do.</p>



<p>But a German company has made an itty-bitty desktop PC that can truly disappear down there, mounted directly to the underside of the desk itself and protruding only just a couple of inches — and this silent, fanless machine is powerful enough to handle full Windows 11.</p>



<p>Arctic is a smaller company, but it’ll be familiar to you if you keep abreast of the latest in desktop PC cooling. The <a href="https://www.arctic.de/us/senza/ACPCC00002A">Senza Under Desk PC</a> is a full desktop PC design, albeit a not-especially-powerful one. The housing looks a little like a server blade, but it’s designed to be screwed directly into the underside of your desk and essential

<p>In a world where ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude are making one breakthrough after another as they chase the holy grail of AGI (Artificial General Intelligence), Amazon’s Alexa is looking decidedly quaint, if not antiquated. </p>



<p>So the world took notice in September 2023 when <a href="https://www.techhive.com/article/2077569/amazon-gives-us-a-peek-at-a-generative-ai-fueled-alexa.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amazon demoed a revamped and AI-powered Alexa</a>, backed by a state-of-the-art large language model (LLM) and capable of a whole new bag of tricks, starting with a vastly upgraded conversation style. </p>



<p>Now here we are, more than a year later, and there’s still no obvious sign of the new AI-powered Alexa on our Amazon Echo speakers. What’s the deal? </p>



<p>Here’s what we know—and don’t know—about the “remarkable” new

<p>Those Intel, AMD, and Nvidia stickers on your laptop aren’t just pretty decoration. They’re part of some big (and very intentional) branding programs with huge amounts of money behind them. That’s why Valve is turning heads with some adjustment to its branding guidelines, with new and very official “Powered by SteamOS” logos and trademarks.</p>



<p>The new logo appeared on Valve’s official <a href="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/steam_brandGuidelines.pdf">Steam branding guidelines document</a> (PDF) for partners who want to leverage Steam to sell laptops, desktops, and other stuff. The “other stuff” is what’s exciting here.</p>

<p>As a tech journalist, it’s rare that I get the chance to evangelize for old technology, but today I’m going to take a shot at it. While my colleagues have upgraded their virtual reality setups over the years to new Pimax and HP headsets, and while my casual VR friends are all playing on their Meta Quests, I’m still rocking a Vive Pro.</p>



<p>I have some good reasons for this — reasons that go beyond the sunk cost fallacy. Sure, I might have spent a <em>lot</em> of money on this setup over the years, on building the VR PC for it, on upgrading the headset with all sorts of accessories… but that doesn’t mean it isn’t still better than most of what’s out there. I’m not bitter or stuck in my ways. No, not at all.</p>



<p>Okay, maybe a little. But I’d argue that a heavily modified Vive Pro can still hold its own among modern VR headsets. There’s no alterna

<p>Ah, the PC gaming versus console gaming debate. As we head into 2025, the discussion is no longer about whether playing <em>Super Mario</em> on the SNES is better or worse than <em>Doom</em> on the PC. The line between console and PC gaming has grown so blurry that the similarities now far outweigh the differences. There’s little that separates them.</p>



<p>Console makers are growing more agnostic with their wares, shifting from exclusivity to a cross-platform embrace. Sony and Microsoft are both doing this to a staggering degree, with only Nintendo mostly in its own world. And if you’re a PC gamer, you likely possess at least one or two consoles, even if it’s just a Switch.</p>



<p>Let’s dive into how consoles and PCs are more alike than ever, and how each console maker still tries to remain unique going into 2025.</p>
