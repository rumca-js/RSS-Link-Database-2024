<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I had this idea that I would add a camera on the ceiling above the table pointed down. Like what streamers do. Then I could have the footage on the big screen TV and we can zoom in on hard to read areas during play. Then people don&#39;t have to constantly ask to read one of the cards across the table. </p> <p>My question is.... Does anybody that is tech savvy know if the easiest way to do this? I don&#39;t want to have to set up a computer and have a bunch of extra programs to do this. Is there a way to just hook up some sort of camera to a TV? </p> <p>Edit... Adding information to make it more clear. My girlfriend is legally blind. She can see, but not well. Games where there is a card row to purchase, for example, we could zoom in to that area for the entire game. </p> <p>It doesn&#39;t make sense to download player aids or to enlarge cards if all the games that we would use this for. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey all, so I play board games fairly regularly with a group. There&#39;s four of us, and we have a classic problem, one of the players is a hardcore board game nerd who has hundreds of games in his collection and he just can&#39;t have fun with simple / chance based games, he wants complexity, but others in the group are struggling to keep up, so when we play co-op games a lot of the time it&#39;s just one person making the majority of decisions, or just me and him discussing turn options while the others are mostly just onlookers. Nobody has complained yet, but I can tell they&#39;re not that engaged.</p> <p>So I&#39;m reaching out here looking for game recommendations. We like Gloomhaven and Arkham Horror (the card game), because in those games the quarterbacky-player doesn&#39;t know what other people have in their deck / what their character can do, so everyone can make their own decisions while still working together to try and win. Are there a

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Evening all</p> <p>I&#39;ve had the Stardew Valley boardgame for a few years now. The issue is that some tiles aren&#39;t printed correctly so some of the letters are missing off the side, images misaligned, etc. It&#39;s playable but it&#39;s kind of upsetting to my brain. Despite meaning to from day one, I&#39;ve never contacted anyone about the mis-print but I would like to. So the questions are:</p> <p>- would they replace these tiles after such a long time? </p> <p>- and who would be the best person to contact? </p> <p>If it&#39;s relevant, I&#39;m in the UK and purchased through Zatu but don&#39;t have a reciept.

I don&#39;t have Bloodlines yet and Immortality is 7/10 and meh. </p> <p>D:I didn&#39;t hit the table as much anymore due to newer games and playing games alas frequently, so I was excited when the app first released because I&#39;d be able to play on my commute etc. However, my big gripe was that the AI provided no challenge. I started on hardest difficulty and won every game with ease. I did a couple of the challenge scenarios but it didn&#39;t help. </p> <p>The AI kept making some pretty rough mistakes like overcommiting troops for weak rewards etc which made it pretty easy to beat. </p> <p>With the release of Rise of Ix I was hoping for a better AI and went back for another game vs 2 AI.
