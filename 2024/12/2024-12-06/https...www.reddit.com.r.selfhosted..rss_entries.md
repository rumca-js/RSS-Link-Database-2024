It’s GUI is so much easier to use than a raw nginx reverse proxy and I prefer it over Caddy and traefik. </p> <p>Here’s how I use it: my primary domain hosts my public-facing website, and my home lab domain is for accessing dashboards like Proxmox, Home Assistant, etc. To secure everything, I rely on Cloudflare’s WAF rules and whitelists, restricting admin dashboard access to just my home, cell, and work IPs. I also use cloudflares ssl keys to make sure all connections are encrypted and force all connections through cloudflare. This way, my dashboards are only accessible from whitelisted ip’s like my home and work, and my portfolio website is fully public while keeping it secure and my home ip hidden. </p> <p>My problems is that Cloudflare limits me to a single IP list and only 5 WAF rules per domain in their free plan. I’d love to use different whitelists and WAF rules for specific subdomains. Whi

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone ! I would like to improve my nas security, but keeping an easy to use experience.</p> <p>My current set up is OPEN LDAP + Authentik + Nginx proxy manager. Previously, I was using different usernames + password for each services (jellyfin, mealie, etc). Because I have more and more services, I would like to centralize my users. That&#39;s why I have Open LDAP. For services which have no LDAP support, I will use authentik proxy provider. Lastly, if I could, I would like to force a 2fa with Authentik for all my applications. </p> <p>My problem is : I use a lot of mobile clients (Symfonium for jellyfin, paperless, etc). Theses clients can&#39;t use API key, avec needs credentials (username + login). This bottleneck my security because 2fa is no longer needed. What I have done now is exposed application can&#39;t have write access, and only a specific group of user can login via LDAP. Admin should pass through Authentik to connect to a service

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi I am thinking about setting up a second node for processes and one mostly just for nas. So i am wondering is there a if i have 2 ethernet ports on both machine can i connect them directly to eachother for faster storage access? If so how can i do it? I have one 1gig and one 2.5 ethernet ports on both which one should i use for data traffic. Thank you</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Agreeable_Middle_711"> /u/Agreeable_Middle_711 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1h7s864/proxmox_2_node_setup/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1h7s864/proxmox_2_node_setup/">[comments]</a></span>

## Is running Jellyfin through a reverse proxy safe enough?

## Recommend a tool to manage native (non-containerized) micro-services on MacOS

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Typically I&#39;d use something like docker compose to spin up multiple services, but the current project I&#39;m working on includes ollama, and ollama can&#39;t access the M1 GPU through a container. This has me thinking that if I&#39;m going to run one service natively, I might as well run everything native. The performance is better, it&#39;s more friendly to my battery, and as long as I&#39;m not introducing a cross-platform dev team, it&#39;s just simpler to remove that extra layer of indirection.</p> <p>The question is how should I start/stop/manage these services? I could just use homebrew, shell scripts, etc. I could maybe script them into tmux, which I use in my terminal anyway, so this makes the logs really accessible. I started looking at Nomad. It worked well, but it seemed way more than I need. </p> <p>I&#39;m looking for simple, but also something that ideally handles things like dependency ordering, log viewing, etc. It would be nice

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve tried kind of everything.</p> <p>I&#39;m on Quantum Fiber&#39;s C5500XK -- I disconnected the supplied router and installed my own (after a bit of a headache). The ONT is in transparent bridge mode (with tagged 201) and the router is working properly.</p> <p>I have a uGreen NASync running their version of Debian. I have Jellyfin and Finamp running fine locally, as well as a copy of Caddy (both are running in the same instance of Docker on the OS).</p> <p>I cannot get it to work properly. If I go to {mypublicip}:44805 (the port reads as open), it works and takes me to the Caddy setup page. I cannot get the associated HTTPS port (44341) to forward, so maybe that&#39;s my error? My caddyfile is quite simple:</p> <pre><code>http://{mypublicip}:44805 { reverse_proxy 192.168.68.54:44829 } https://{mypublicip}:44341 { reverse_proxy 192.168.68.54:44829 } </code></pre> <p>I&#39;m wondering if this has something to do with UGOS and blocking ports.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have fresh Servarr setup and am trying to get my head around the current tech stack. How do I get both Jellyfin and Plex to talk to Kodi nicely?</p> <p>I use Jellyfin as my media server for my self hosted content, my library is pretty small as I&#39;ve only just started setting it up (on a NUC for testing), however I also have access to a private Plex server with a <em>large</em> amount of content. Obviously both the quality and the speed is much better when accessing content from Jellyfin, (scrubbing can be particularly slow on plex), so I want to use that as my <em>primary</em> source, and fall back to Plex if it&#39;s not available locally (on Jellyfin).</p> <p>What&#39;s the best way of achieving this?</p> <p>My current setup is to have 2 separate profiles in Kodi, and switching between the two for streamed vs locally hosted content. Obviously this isn&#39;t ideal, but does allow complete separation of the libraries, I can then use <a href="htt
