        "description": "In today's Daily Fix:\nIt's been more than a year since the first official trailer for Grand Theft Auto 6, and we've seen practically zilch from that game since. That hasn't stopped GTA fans from creating insane theories, however, but according to one ex-Rockstar dev, that's all part of the plan. Apparently Rockstar knows how rabid of a fanbase they have, and they enjoy seeing their fans keep the discussion going without Rockstar having to lift so much as a finger. In related news, a former Sony exec admitted that PlayStation's timed exclusivity with the GTA 3 Trilogy was because they were scared of Xbox. In other news, Hazelight Studios' new game has reportedly leaked, and Ubisoft is looking to structure a possible buyout without the Guillemot family losing control.",

It still has a few too many currencies and all the gacha pulls you\u2019d expect from its mobile roots, but it's all in service of building a gorgeous, gigantic wardrobe worth getting excited about. It features some of the most intricate and detailed outfits in any game, and while unlocking them can require a lot of grinding (or some real-world money) that just means time spent joyfully exploring its packed open world. There's always something new and either cute or bizarrely dark to discover, and you'll still be unraveling secrets after dozens of hours. Infinity Nikki is perfectly girly positivity rolled up in a pink and sparkling package, and regardless of whether that is something you've wanted, it might just be what you need.\n\nWhat did you think of our Infinity Nikki IGN review and this Infinity Nikki gameplay?

        "description": "Indiana Jones and the Great Circle reviewed by Luke Reilly on Xbox Series X, also available on PC.\n\nIndiana Jones and the Great Circle nails nearly everything about the best parts of the storied franchise upon which it\u2019s based, from the title card and location fonts to Harrison Ford\u2019s finger waggle, but its successes go way beyond its faithfulness to the finer points of the films. With a host of gorgeous and lavishly detailed levels, satisfying combat hinged on jawbreaking haymakers, and a focus on slow-paced exploration, platforming, and puzzle solving (interspersed with a handful of high-voltage action scenes), The Great Circle is an irresistible and immersive global treasure hunt for Indy fans who\u2019ve felt underserved by the likes of The Dial of Destiny and Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Moreover, it sets itself apart from this decade\u2019s increasingly homogenised third-person action games by opting for a classic first-person perspective inspired by the likes of The Chronicles of Riddi",
