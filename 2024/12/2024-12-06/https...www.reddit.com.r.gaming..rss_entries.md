<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I just finished Divinity Original Sin 2, and loved it. I&#39;m looking for something else to play now. Would love an Rpg suggestion, but anything will do.</p> <p>I&#39;ve played Torment: Tales of Numenora, and both Pillars of Eternity games, so leave them out</p> <p>Edit: I don&#39;t have a series X or S so please limit suggestions to Xbox one, that&#39;s why I specifically said Xbox one in the title.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SavageTS1979"> /u/SavageTS1979 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h7opia/looking_for_new_games_to_play_after_finishing/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h7opia/looking_for_new_games_to_play_after_finishing/">[comments]</a></span>
