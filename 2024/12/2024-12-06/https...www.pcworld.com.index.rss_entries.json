As we head into 2025, the discussion is no longer about whether playing <em>Super Mario</em> on the SNES is better or worse than <em>Doom</em> on the PC. The line between console and PC gaming has grown so blurry that the similarities now far outweigh the differences. There\u2019s little that separates them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Console makers are growing more agnostic with their wares, shifting from exclusivity to a cross-platform embrace. Sony and Microsoft are both doing this to a staggering degree, with only Nintendo mostly in its own world. And if you\u2019re a PC gamer, you likely possess at least one or two consoles, even if it\u2019s just a Switch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s dive into how consoles and PCs are more alike than ever, and how each console maker still tries to remain unique going into 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading",
