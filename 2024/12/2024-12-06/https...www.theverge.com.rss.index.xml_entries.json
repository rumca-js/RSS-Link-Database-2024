Fares will be upfront and equal to UberX and Uber Comfort prices. The vehicles will include safety drivers, so it won\u2019t be a fully autonomous service at launch. But Uber and WeRide said they aim to offer driverless vehicles to passengers in 2025. </p>\n<div class=\"c-float-left c-float-hang\"><aside id=\"Nv1Vtw\"><q>The vehicles will include safety drivers</",
