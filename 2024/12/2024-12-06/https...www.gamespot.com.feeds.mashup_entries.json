The report said Tencent is asking for a \"greater say on future board decisions\" in exchange for putting more money into Ubisoft. The report also said Tencent may not invest any further amount of money into Ubisoft.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-co-founders-want-to-main",

Seriously.</p><p>Call of Duty has, for many years, <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-dutys-best-stoner-dlc-yet-turns-you-into-a-pot-smoking-lizard/1100-6528200/\">enjoyed and embraced pot-smoking</a>, and the new Dank Days skin bundle that turns you into a pot-smoking lizard continues that trend. The gun even lets you spark up and use your gun as a bong, as smoke clouds emerge. The \"Toxic Pawsitivity Mastercraft,\" meanwhile, transforms the baseball bat melee weapon into a rave, with a little cat acting as the DJ.
