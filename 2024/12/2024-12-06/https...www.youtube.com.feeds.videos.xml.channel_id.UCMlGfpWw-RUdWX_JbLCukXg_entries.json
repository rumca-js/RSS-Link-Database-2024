Join me on a deep dive into the world of exceptions and discover how they can be harnessed to create more space efficient firmware. We\u2019ll explore the requirements and best practices of embedded development, and show what is required to use exceptions in that environment. By the end of this talk, you\u2019ll have a thorough understanding of how exceptions are handled, what their space costs are, and how exceptions compare to functional errors as values.\n---\n\nSlides: https:",
