Hoping I could get some advice on where to find Dolby Atmos tracks for movies.</p> <p>For context, I’m building a personal collection of shows and films to watch on my ATV 4K with Infuse video player. Infuse can only handle Dolby Atmos tracks through Dolby Digital Plus (E-AC3) currently. Most of the torrents I find are all TrueHD 7.1 which gets converted to PCM and loses the Atmos data in the process. The lossless audio is nice but the file sizes are huge as a result. </p> <p>I’ve found plenty of ‘WebDL’ files that have E-AC3 Atmos audio and I’ve remuxed them into my encodes as a compromise for storage. I’m struggling like hell with Disney releases though. At the minute I’m sticking to TrueHD 5.1 because it helps with storage.</p> <p>Where can I get E-AC3 Atmos tracks? - Can you download from Disney+ and pull the audio track out (remux)? If so, how? - Are there any sites where I can just download the E-AC3 track from?</

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong> This is kind of a niche problem, but if any of y&#39;all have wisdom, it&#39;d be much appreciated.</p> <p>I work at a movie theater, and recently we were given new projectors that took an HDMI signal. We started watching our favorite movies on the big screen after work, however the only device we&#39;ve been able to get working on the projectors/servers is my laptop. So if we want to watch a movie, I need offline access to it. Luckily, Microsoft Movies and TV allows me to download movies that I own to watch offline, I even have access to the MP4 files that I download, but we began to notice that these files only play in stereo, and preferably we&#39;d be able to watch the movies in 5.1 surround sound. I took the MP4 files into MKVToolNix and found that the MP4 files have two audio tracks, one in stereo and another in 5.1, but for whatever reason, the MP4 file defaults to stereo. I tied to export the file into an MKV file

The mod is called Ghetto&#39;s Firearms, and as said in the mod description, <strong>IF YOUR MOD DOESN&#39;T LOAD AND YOU ARE USING A PIRATED COPY OF BLADE AND SORCERY, THAT IS BECAUSE OF THE ANTI PIRATE SOFTWARE IN THE MOD, WE WILL NOT HELP PIRATES, GO SUPPORT THE DEVS. STOP BEING POOR</strong>. (ctrl+c ctrl+v) I have no clue how anti piracy measures work/what goes into them, but I assume it&#39;s something with connecting to steam?
