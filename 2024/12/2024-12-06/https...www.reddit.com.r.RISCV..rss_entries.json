Well, it arrived and I wanted to get back to my experiments. But upon setting the boot switches, all I get is a blinking orange light on the ethernet port - I suppose it&#39;s the link light.</p> <p>What would be the reason for this? Nothing shows up on UART either and I do not have any JTAG hardware to dig deeper.</p> <p>I did remove the NVMe SSD too. But I also noticed that if I touch the ethernet port housing - or anything metallic on the board, really - while there is no RJ45 plug inserted, it feels rather static-y. Not sure if this is normal or not, so I&#39;m mentioning it...</p> <p>Any ideas?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/IngwiePhoenix\"> /u/IngwiePhoenix </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1h84w0m/vf2_troubbleshooting_link_led_blinks_but_nothing/\">[link]</a>",
