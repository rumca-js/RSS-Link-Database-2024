If you\u2019re struggling with exposing services (external load balancer) securely in Kubernetes but don\u2019t have a static IP or can\u2019t change firewall configurations, the frp Kubernetes Operator might be the solution. This operator automates the deployment of frp (Fast Reverse Proxy) clients and tunnels, removing the need for complex ingress setups and firewall changes.</p> <p>With support for protocols like TCP, UDP, HTTP, and HTTPS, it\u2019s ideal for use cases such as home labs, self-hosted apps, or secure remote access. It also provides flexible, cost-effective exit servers and offers built-in encryption and compression for optimized performance.</p> <p>GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/Aureum-Cloud/frp-Operator\">https://github.com/Aureum-Cloud/frp-Operator</a></p> <p>Helm: <a href=\"https://frp-operator.aureum.cloud\">https://frp-operator.aureum.cloud</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/n",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi everyone ! I would like to improve my nas security, but keeping an easy to use experience.</p> <p>My current set up is OPEN LDAP + Authentik + Nginx proxy manager. Previously, I was using different usernames + password for each services (jellyfin, mealie, etc). Because I have more and more services, I would like to centralize my users. That&#39;s why I have Open LDAP. For services which have no LDAP support, I will use authentik proxy provider. Lastly, if I could, I would like to force a 2fa with Authentik for all my applications. </p> <p>My problem is : I use a lot of mobile clients (Symfonium for jellyfin, paperless, etc). Theses clients can&#39;t use API key, avec needs credentials (username + login). This bottleneck my security because 2fa is no longer needed. What I have done now is exposed application can&#39;t have write access, and only a specific group of user can login via LDAP. Admin should pass through Authentik to connect to a service",
