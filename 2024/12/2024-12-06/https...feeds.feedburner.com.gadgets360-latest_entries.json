The research, published in Science, highlights how climate change is accelerating extinction risks, especially for amphibians and species in isolated ecosystems. With emissions continuing at current rates, the risk of extinction rises sharply, particularly in regions like South America, Australia, and New Zealand. Immediate action on greenhouse gas emissions is crucial to halt this alarming trend.",

The skulls, dating back to 5618-5335 B.C., suggest they were part of a unique ancestor practice.

This decline, particularly in low-altitude clouds, has been linked to a 0.23\u00b0C increase in global mean temperature. The study highlights that global warming itself may be reducing cloud cover, suggesting further temperature increases are imminent. Researchers urge action on carbon budgets and adaptation measures.",

This innovative design was inspired by the flight mechanics of crows, which use their legs to spring into the air, allowing them to conserve energy compared to relying solely on wings. RAVEN features a fixed-wing design, a split-V tail, and a front-mounted engine to power a single propeller. During tests, the robot demonstrated its ability to walk, hop, and leap into the air while transitioning to flight. This versatile design is seen as a step forward in creating drones with multimodal locomotion for various real-world applications.",
