<p>Screenwriter, musician and director who won an Oscar, with Woody Allen, for the screenplay of Annie Hall</p><p>Marshall Brickman, who has died aged 85, was a successful musician, writer and film director, but will be remembered best for his collaborations with Woody Allen on three of Allen’s best movies: Sleeper (1973), Annie Hall (1977) and Manhattan (1979). The pair won an Oscar for the original screenplay of Annie Hall, which also took the awards for best picture, best director for Allen and best actress for Diane Keaton.</p><p>Allen skipped the awards ceremony, and when Brickman accepted the best writer statuette, he said: “Half of this little piece of tin, if not much more, belongs to Woody, who is probably the greatest collaborator anyone could ever wish for. He does a lot of brilliant work. He takes our script and makes it into what you saw. He picks up my lunch check for about five months, and today he refuses to come out of his apartment.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguar

<p>With a dictatorship under pressure, a nation’s chaos could reshape regional alliances and risk broader instability across the Middle East</p><p>Is the Syrian war – the 21st century’s most protracted and second-deadliest conflict – finally nearing its end?

<p><strong>Sadler’s Wells, London<br></strong>Claire Cunningham’s affecting solo performance is a meditation on how we find our way along unexpected paths</p><p>A dance performance that credits two mountaineering consultants – now that’s intriguing. Claire Cunningham is dressed in hiking gear: backpack, flask, a transparent pouch for a map around her neck. Her journey only takes her around the small theatre, counting steps, scaling the seats of the auditorium, finding shelter in a mountain of peaks made of tangled crutches, but her ramble becomes a meditation on finding our way along life’s unexpected paths.</p><p>It’s a solo show, but Cunningham is not alone on stage. There’s her BSL interpreter, and members of the audience are invited to slouch on beanbags (all are relaxed performances, with accommodation for various access needs). We’re not to worry if our bodies – or our beanbags – make a noise, it’s all part of the landscape, she tells us in a sort of pre-expedition briefing. A

<p>The veteran actor’s pleasurably zealous turn could be given twice as much screen time in what feels like a wade through dull dramatisations of bits of scripture</p><p>You know the way Dracula likes to deliver a dramatic speech, then turns into a bat, and flies away? It turns out that the angel Gabriel does something similar, only he turns into a blue scarf, the same kind of snazzy number you might get in Monsoon as a birthday present for your mum. Whoosh! Away he goes. Unfortunately, Gabriel-as-knitwear is about as entertaining as it gets in this fairly straightforward biblical adaptation of the early years of Mary, mother of Christ.</p><p>Actually that’s not quite fair.

Let’s get that clear from the start. If Keir Starmer does not succeed, too many British voters will conclude that both the traditional parties, Labour and Conservative, have proved useless and that it is time to try something else – with that something else being nationalist populism. If this Labour government goes down, what comes next will be Faragism, either as a Reform UK-Conservative hybrid or neat and undiluted.</p><p>That is what’s at stake.

Ulvaeus is indeed famous and rich but is firmly “not in the arsehole category.

<p>Will Collier is revelling in the Castres fans’ passion and enjoying other benefits of life in south of France</p><p>It is the match-day bus rides to his new club’s stadium that, for Will Collier, perfectly capture the parallel universe of French club rugby. “You can hear the fans when you’re still a minute away,” says the former Harlequins prop, one of the latest band of Premiership pros to relocate to the Top 14, in his case to Castres. “You can see the smoke and the flares going off. There are drums and trumpeters … they even had a saxophonist last week. It’s absolutely bonkers. The passion is wild.”</p><p>Welcome to a different world. Castres, about 50 miles from Toulouse, is is a modest-sized town of 50,000-odd people but rugby fever is rampant. “When we played Toulouse at home in October there were people crying in the pre-game guard of honour.

 This award-winning novel set in northern Sweden (the title means both “the land” and “my mother”) is subtitled “An Epic”, but its form – spare, haiku-like verse – means the pages breathe freely. The impressionistic style is matched by the structure, which shifts back and forward, covering a century from 1913 to 2015 in the lives of two indigenous Sámi families. They face the arrival of Swedish settlers and the destruction of their culture, including the building of a dam on Sámi land. One woman regrets her own failure to resist – “The Swedish / language grew / along my thoughts // The Sámi since long / asleep in the body / of shame // obedience overlaid” – and wonders o

<p>My entire leg was on fire. It was as if someone had slit it open with a knife</p><p>One night, while in my recording studio in Tucker, Georgia, my ankle started getting red, itchy and swollen. I love walking and hiking, so I assumed I had hurt it on a&nbsp;recent trek. Three days later, I was hobbling, unable to put pressure on my leg without severe pain. What worried me the most was that the colour had changed. My ankle was no longer red and angry; it was now blue and purple.</p><p>The timing couldn’t have been any worse. I’m a musician and had a gig that evening.

<p>The starriest spy show of the year is here! And it’s got guns and gore galore – not to mention Sarah Lancashire as an ice queen. Fill your festive boots</p><p>It has been a big year for big names engaging in small-screen espionage, but Black Doves may be the starriest yet. This nightmare before Christmas, which stars Keira Knightley, Ben Whishaw and Sarah Lancashire, adds a festive twist to the spy genre, as the eponymous shady organisation of mercenaries find themselves wrapped up in a conspiracy that is – as these things always are – bigger than they first think it is going to be.</p><p>With that stellar cast, and its sombre trailers, I had expected it to be a straight-faced thriller. In fact, what emerges from the carnage that takes place before the opening titles begin is pulpy popcorn TV. Knightley plays Helen Webb, a spy who has infiltrated the top levels of the British government by assuming a false identity and marrying a man who would go on to become defence secretary. He

<p>The world is a big thing to get interested in, writes advice columnist <strong>Eleanor Gordon-Smith</strong>. What if you start with the little things instead?</p><p><strong>I used to be really interested in the world. I’d read lots of news, books from authors around the world and had opinions about world events. I work for a charity that works globally too. But lately I’ve become less engaged. I don’t know if it’s due to having children, fatigue or the harshness of the world, but I feel unplugged from it all and not interested. Equally I’m not interested in anything else as an alternative. I feel my world becoming smaller. </strong><strong>I spend hours scrolling Instagram too.

The runway models sashay from all directions, while the lights blaze red, blue and white for Paris fashion week.</p><p>It’s big all right, but perhaps it should have gone home because what is this, exactly?
