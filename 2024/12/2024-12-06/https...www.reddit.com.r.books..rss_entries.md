## "One does not read a book: one can only reread it" - V. Nabokov

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I finished my first time through <em>The Brothers Karamazov</em> (the Katz translation; excellent, btw) on December 2. </p> <p>Noted weirdo Vladimir Nabokov said once that one doesn&#39;t read a book, one only <em>re</em>reads it. It&#39;s his fancy way of saying that the first time through a book doesn&#39;t really count, since the reader is mostly just trying to make sense of the scale and dimensions of the story. It&#39;s the reread where the book starts to really reveal itself to the reader. </p> <p>So, I picked up the McReynolds translation (from Norton*) and started the introduction tonight (December 6 -- this will be relevant in two shakes).</p> <p>[* The McReynolds is worth it if only for the &quot;Names in <em>The Brothers Karamazov</em>,&quot; which goes into the etymological roots of the names.]</p> <p>In the introduction she mentions two scenes that I have <em>absolutely</em> no memory of (both quotes come from p viii in the Norton Critic

A familiar quote, &quot;I had to read in college (or high school) but I don&#39;t need to anymore.&quot;</p> <p>I grew up in a household of readers and have family who are still voracious readers.</p> <p>20 years ago, I moved from a major Northern U.S. metropolis to a major Southern U.S. metropolis.</p> <p>In my former home everyone I knew read all the time - different stuff, but they read. Poor people, rich people - for most it had been a lifetime avocation. And they did love reading.</p> <p>When I moved, my partner (who was a former publishing person like me) and me continued our reading adventure. </p> <p>But NO ONE is our social circle reads here. Not books, not anything. Our friends don&#39;t even have books in their homes. They come to our house and see the books crammed in the 6 big bookcases and usually the first comment is &quot;Did you read all of these?&quot;

Not just reading them, but looking at them, holding them, feeling them, turning the pages, admiring the covers, seeing them displayed on my bookshelves so prettily, reorganizing my shelves. Books are art to me. Over the past few years one of my main hobbies was exploring used bookstores for fantasy, science fiction, lit fic, history, and poetry. I live in an area with many amazing ones and I would spend hours on my days off exploring them and learning about all the authors I wanted to read. The vast majority of my collection is used books and I often would only be spending a few dollars on one book even for very popular authors and that’s how I justified to myself that it was ok I was doing all this buying.</p> <p>I told myself that I was &quot;collecting,&quot; which was a very different thing than hoarding in my mind.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I loved this book. I loved leto’s ramblings and I loved moneo. And I loved the way the golden path is explained. </p> <p>But this book had a few major issues for me. </p> <p>The biggest is the dialogue. Half the time I had no idea wtf anyone was talking about. The other half, the dialogue felt so robotic. And the emotion is so unreadable. Also, I’ve never seen anyone use as many exclamation points as frank herbert. Especially when they’re not needed or when they don’t fit the scene and emotion. A character doesn’t cry but exclaims. A character can be trying to say something quietly but there’s an exclamation mark. It sends so many mixed signals that it’s hard to tell what’s happening. I swear there’s at least one exclamation point in every paragraph. </p> <p>The second is that everyone except Leto is very flat. Hwi noree and Duncan and moneo and siona could have been so interesting but they are barely explored. And these characters barely show emotio
