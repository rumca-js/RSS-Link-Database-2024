<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I just finished the trilogy, I want to first say that I finished the first two books in like 2 weeks. And was on the same pace with the last book. But finishing it felt like I got slapped in the face by the author. Just no one gets a happy ending. Besides maybe Ardee and Glokta? But even then it is definitely bittersweet. And then theres the fact that not one of these fuckers learn a goddamn thing after 3 books. This is probably what hurts the most cause I loved all of the main characters. The author did an amazing job with the dialogue both internal and external. But seeing them stay relatively the same or maybe even worse off hurts the most.</p> <p>I seriously need something similar with a satisfying ending. Though the only thing similar that I can think of is GOT. And look at where that went.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/big_boy584"> /u/big_boy584 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddi

It seemed to be kinda spinning its wheels for a long while, and perhaps didn&#39;t need to be quite as long as it seems the majority of fantasy books are these days. Most of the driving plot development happened near the end in a big burst, and some stuff really could&#39;ve been tightened up or excised (especially with the Lilla and Xessa POVs). </p> <p>I do feel like some things didn&#39;t completely land. There was one major character revelation, changing everything... which I didn&#39;t feel ult

No electricity or digital tech. Magic is good though! </p> <p>Oh and please specify if it’s light hearted or more serious. I do like drama!

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have observed a pattern in many big fantasy epic’s major conflict. By this I am referring to events like such as: - Sauron in Lord of the Rings - The Dark One in the Wheel of Time - Odium in the Stormlight Archive - Voldemort from Harry Potter - The Dragons from The Priory of the Orange Tree - The Others in A Song of Ice and Fire* - The Crippled God in the Malazan Series*</p> <p>*I have not read these two books personally, but from what I have heard about them, they seem to follow the pattern I am describing.

In each case, there is at least some advanced knowledge and understanding of these threats, even if the information is fragmented.

It was the sole reason <em>Noose</em> caught my eye in an instant to begin with when the publisher, Brigids Gate Press, announced that it was available to request on platforms like BookSirens and NetGalley. To follow that up, I came across the following post put up by the author on X/Twitter:</p> <p><strong><em>“A train massacre, mad scientist, a witch, ghost stories, shoo fly, illusions and hallucinations, ghosts, riddles in the dark, mayhem, hammers, shotguns, and more all wrapped up in a bullet-fast revenge tale.”</em></strong></p> <p>I mean, how could you not be intrigued by that?! I most certainly was, and I knew it then and there that I just simply had to have a go at it. And hence, I would like to thank the author and the publisher of this awesome western novella for making the digital review copy available.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>What’s it about?</strong></p> <p>Well, let’s start with th

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This came up as something that annoyed a lot of people in a previous thread. I honestly haven&#39;t come across this very much though I&#39;ve been reading a lot of fantasy books for a long time (though, I don&#39;t read much YA, is this maybe where this tends to come up?) What books are people talking about that have this trope? Do any of them do it well? That comment suggested this was really overused but apart from maybe Licanius I can&#39;t really think of many examples.</p> <p>I suppose another variation is &#39;worlds where magic is illegal&#39; because while I can think of a lot of books where it&#39;s carefully controlled or institutionalized or something like that there don&#39;t seem to be that many that do the whole witch-hunt thing. Personally, I like this trope if it&#39;s well done, so would appreciate ideas/recs!

I love its take on superheroes so much which I feel it does better than any of the other non-DC/Marvel superhero media like Invincible, The Boys, MHA etc. But after finishing it a few years ago (and devouring an obscenely unhealthy amount of fanfiction which is surprisingly abundant), my hunger for superhero fantasy books have reached an all time high.</p> <p>A lot of urban fantasy can be sorta considered &#39;superhero&#39; if you look at it a certain way but in my opinion, there are a few criterias for it to truly count as superhero (though you can absolutely disagree with them). First off, there needs to be a variety in the powers held by the characters so it can&#39;t all be magic or can&#39;t all be slightly different varieties of the same powers. Second is that the &#39;heroes&#39; need to occupy the same roles that they traditionally do in superhero media,

These are non-horror books that were not intended to scare the audience.</p> <p>When I was in 7th grade, I read the first <em>Twilight.</em> I was very scared by it, particularly by Edward and the abusive relationship he draws Bella into.

So if your library uses hoopla at all, you have access to some really great spec fic short stories!</p> <p>For those who might worry about supporting these magazines - your library pays hoopla for each checkout, and you pay for your library with taxes.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Is there a way to write a character who has lived a life before the story starts interesting? My vision is something similar to Logan in a fantasy setting. The protagonist is not old by any means, but he is approaching middle years, and he has been part of his share of wars and raids. </p> <p>The continent is massive and he has not seen all of it by any means, a few countries and only in wars and the Raid. This story would take him to new places, new cultures, and into new situations. So long as he isn’t over powered, the sheer things he doesn’t know compared his still lengthy experience should make for interesting character, right?</p> <p>Thank you!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Redbeardwrites"> /u/Redbeardwrites </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1h7r9pr/experienced_protagonist/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/

I am halfway through Malazan Book of the Fallen, and Erikson has to be my favourite author of all time now.</p> <p>Read the First Law trilogy and found that Abercrombie is not for me. I simply couldn&#39;t stand his writing and plot.</p> <p>I recently got halfway through Rythm of War, before finally giving up on Sanderson. I just can&#39;t do it, man. Somehow you turned such a magical world into the single most boring book I have ever read, so much so it made Crossroads of Twilight feel like The Return of the King.</p> <p>Patricia McKillip&#39;s Riddle Master Trilogy was pleasently refreshing, though I found the last book a bit of a drag, and the ending was fairly predictable and lackluster.</p> <p>I dipped my toes into some Manga, finishing Blame! and 3 volumes into Berserk now and loved/ing both.</p> <p>Illium was also great, looking forward to Olympos, though Dan seems to have gone off the deep e

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Since most of the &quot;super famous&quot; fantasy series are medieval fantasy (lotr, got, wot) or adjacent to it, what other subgenre of fantasy holds a special place in your heart? For me it has always been modern urban fantasy but the past weeks it&#39;s been turning more towards 1800-1920s historical fantasy</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/lxurin_hei"> /u/lxurin_hei </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1h7o78f/whats_your_favourite_nonmedieval_fantasy_subgenre/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1h7o78f/whats_your_favourite_nonmedieval_fantasy_subgenre/">[comments]</a></span>
