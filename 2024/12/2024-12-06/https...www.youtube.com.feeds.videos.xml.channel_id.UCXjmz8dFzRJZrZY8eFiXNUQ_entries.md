At this point, Seth Rogen has made such a name for himself in Hollywood that he can practically do anything he wants.  With a string of cult classics like Superbad, Pineapple Express, Knocked Up, and countless others, Seth Rogen has proven himself a powerhouse in the entertainment industry.  Though one movie, back in 2011, almost destroyed his career so badly, we might have never seen another project from Rogen again.  The Green Hornet should have been an easy reboot for superhero hungry audiences.  But when Seth Rogen portrayed The Green Hornet, fans universally rejected him and the movie.  Luckily it was a small speed bump, and Seth Rogen came out the other side stronger than ever.
