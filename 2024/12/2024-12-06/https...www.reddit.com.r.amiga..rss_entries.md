## Looking for advice on how to create a bootable Hippoplayer disk for Workbench 1.3

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have a bone stock A500 with kickstart 1.3, and I want to use Hippo player with it. It won&#39;t work without reqtools.library, but I don&#39;t want to add the library to my workbench disk. I don&#39;t have any sort of mass storage (no hdds, no cf cards etc) so what I am hoping to do is create a super minimal workbench disk that contains just enough workbench to boot up and launch Hippoplayer, and then load in mod files from other disks.</p> <p>Has anyone tried anything like this?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/mattthepianoman"> /u/mattthepianoman </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1h85jmd/looking_for_advice_on_how_to_create_a_bootable/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1h85jmd/looking_for_advice_on_how_to_create_a_bootable/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello ,</p> <p>A friend of mine gave an old but functional Amiga 500 with 1 mb memory.<br/> I only play games , itÂ´s better a Gotek ( which one) or PiStorm ? If PiStorm, where i start ? PiStorm is a kind of emulation? Or is hardware emulation as FPGA ? I only have to buy RPI and PiStorm, or other add ons are necessary? Thank you all</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ccouteiro"> /u/ccouteiro </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1h80248/amiga_500_pistorm/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1h80248/amiga_500_pistorm/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello, I had an amiga 500, and I invested many hours surfing communities and forums to find a specific game that i remember playing.</p> <p>It is a war game, where you command a <strong>small group of special ops</strong> soldiers. the <strong>view is from above</strong>. I am sure it was NOT a side scroller of any kind.</p> <p>It was in <strong>real time</strong>, and your squad was very small , I would say less then 4 people.</p> <p>The art style was not 3d/polygonal.</p> <p>In this game there was a mission where you had to plant TNT on a fleet of moored submarines, so you had to reach the submarines, plant the tnt on top of them, and run away.</p> <p>What this game is not</p> <ul> <li>cannon fodder</li> <li>navy seals</li> <li>dogs of war</li> </ul> <p>Thank you for your help</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/__Geralt"> /u/__Geralt </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comment
