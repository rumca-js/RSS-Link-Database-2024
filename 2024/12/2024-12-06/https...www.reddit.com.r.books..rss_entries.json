And I loved the way the golden path is explained. </p> <p>But this book had a few major issues for me. </p> <p>The biggest is the dialogue. Half the time I had no idea wtf anyone was talking about. The other half, the dialogue felt so robotic. And the emotion is so unreadable. Also, I\u2019ve never seen anyone use as many exclamation points as frank herbert. Especially when they\u2019re not needed or when they don\u2019t fit the scene and emotion. A character doesn\u2019t cry but exclaims. A character can be trying to say something quietly but there\u2019s an exclamation mark. It sends so many mixed signals that it\u2019s hard to tell what\u2019s happening. I swear there\u2019s at least one exclamation point in every paragraph. </p> <p>The second is that everyone except Leto is very flat. Hwi noree and Duncan and moneo and siona could have been so interesting but they are barely explored. And these characters barely show emotio",

I\u2019d like to see how people feel about reading copies of books from collector\u2019s sets specifically. </p> <p>For example, have a set of Harry Potter that was gifted to me over 10 years ago. When the spines are lined up, they create an image of Hogwarts. I\u2019ve never read these copies because I\u2019ve always wanted to preserve the look of the spines. I have an older set that\u2019s falling apart from use so I read those copies instead.
