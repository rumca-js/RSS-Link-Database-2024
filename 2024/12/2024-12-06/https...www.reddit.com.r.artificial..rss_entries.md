<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>What do you think about this video. This is definitely getting much more advanced at a much faster rate than I expected. The fact AGI can create other AGI&#39;S/AI is definitely scary and this can compound to infinity. Than you have other aspects of how realistic an AI can make a video.
