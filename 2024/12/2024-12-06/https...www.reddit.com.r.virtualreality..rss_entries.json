I thought EMG and eeg all used pads like the ones you can get from adafruit. Somehow I missed all this modern dry electrode stuff. It honestly seems like we are at the point where the limitation is software not hardware. Would not be surprised if normal vr games were to suddenly start supporting these sorts of devices. </p> <p>Edit: also do you guys know if anyone has attempted to use mental imagery rather than perceptual imagery as a method of control. Both galea and nextmind read data from the visual cortex. Research states that mental images are processed there alongside perceptual ones. I think a sigil type control structure would work well in a game setting.
