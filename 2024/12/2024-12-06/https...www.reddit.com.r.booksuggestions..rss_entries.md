I also enjoy Kdrama.</p> <p>I&#39;m mostly looking for a book where the main characters bicker and tease each other a lot, so most likely an enemies to lovers. I really enjoy when the male lead is one of those black haired, protective guys like Rhysand from Acotar.

I know she has read and enjoyed the A Court of Thorns and Roses series by Sarah J Maas (she bought a fancy collectors edition pack of them and also has regular versions of each book) and The Fourth Wing series by Rebecca Yarros. I believe she has also read the Cruel Prince series by Holly Black, but not certain on that one. She also likes Colleen Hoover. In terms of mystery she has apparently read nearly everything by Shari Lapena, so another author with a similar style would be great! </p> <p>Female lead characters and lead characters with physical disabilities are a plus! </p> <p>(i wasnt certain whether to flair this as romance or sci-fi/fantasy, so i just chose the latter)</p> <p>Thanks in advance for any recommendations you have! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Pretty-Ambassa

I have started a few books over the last few years but struggle to finish them if they are slow and long. I loved Harry Potter and some other series when I was young, and I couldn&#39;t put the books down. But it&#39;s been a long time since I&#39;ve really been hooked on a series.

After every class, I use to call him and discuss what we saw at that class, and it was a really nice time! So i’m kind of looking for a nice book about weird/funny/interesting stories about the cold war that not everybody would know! The only requirement I have is for the book to be translated in french, as it’s both our first language!

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve read the books in The Gray Man series and loved them all except book 9.</p> <p>According to Audible, there are several series that are similar. I tried several of them.</p> <p>The 6:20 Man. It was ok. Well written, but not nearly as exciting or action-packed. </p> <p>Silencer. It was action packed but terribly written.</p> <p>The Drifter. It was boring.</p> <p>The Killing Floor. It was criminally boring.</p> <p>I include these to clarify books I&#39;m looking for. Action and good writing. Ideally with a smart protagonist who solves problems in clever, unexpected ways. Doesn&#39;t need to be a lot of character development. Doesn&#39;t need to be deep or meaningful. And I&#39;d be willing to try other settings, as long as they&#39;re well thought out (already read a lot of Timothy Zahn&#39;s stuff and liked it, especially the Thrawn books).</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Co

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi! I’d love to start reading some books to my almost 4 year old and am looking for ideas.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello, I’m looking for fiction novels that are mainly focused on one main character and their struggles to overcome something. I like authors who are able to dive deep into what character’s emotional experience and I love a book that moves me to tears. I am interested in topics such as trauma, mental illness and grief. </p> <p>I have recently been reading a bunch of YA novels (although I am 53F)simply because these topics seem more common in YA than in just adult books but I am open to either. I’ve enjoyed such authors as: Nina La Cour and Helena Fox. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Longjumping_Cry709"> /u/Longjumping_Cry709 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1h7nyp7/book_suggestions_for_characterdriven_and/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1h7nyp7/book_suggestions_for_characterdriven_and/">[comment

## modern romance books with good prose & lovable characters

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have recently gotten back into reading and I have been wanting to read a really good love story, but I have dnf’d so many of the popular “booktok” romances because they feel just a bit juvenile to me, in language and overall storytelling. I don’t think I really want a romcom, or to feel like I’m reading my grandma’s romance book. I just want something a bit more literary and complex while still being modern, with characters that are easy to love and root for. I would prefer if the characters are similar to my own age range (early to mid twenties) just because I feel like they are more relatable. Any genre is okay so long as there’s a great romance subplot </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/theresnoplan_"> /u/theresnoplan_ </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1h7nxz2/modern_romance_books_with_good_prose_lovable/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https:/
