Researchers at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) have developed a bird-like robot named RAVEN (Robotic Avian-inspired Vehicle for multiple ENvironments), designed to launch into flight using spring-loaded legs. This innovative design was inspired by the flight mechanics of crows, which use their legs to spring into the air, allowing them to conserve energy compared to relying solely on wings. RAVEN features a fixed-wing design, a split-V tail, and a front-mounted engine to power a single propeller. During tests, the robot demonstrated its ability to walk, hop, and leap into the air while transitioning to flight. This versatile design is seen as a step forward in creating drones with multimodal locomotion for various real-world applications.
