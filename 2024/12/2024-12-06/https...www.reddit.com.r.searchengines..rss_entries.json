It&#39;s hilarious, and it IS on Youtube (don&#39;t bother).

I&#39;m currently working on integrating actual results, but I got the home page down! And it works. I&#39;m soon to host it on Netlify until I buy a domain. So far the Open Maps button opens the website for Apple Maps (but if you&#39;re on an Apple device, it opens the Maps app), the Control Center menu allows you to switch from light and dark modes and view about info, and the Maps Search actually searches things on Apple Maps for web.</p> <p>Video demo: <a href=\"https://streamable.com/e/7hi6nz\">https://stre",
