I encountered a little trouble getting it installed but not too bad. </p> <p>It&#39;s taken me about 7-10 days to get it setup without Google services here in the U.S. My only Google apps downloaded from Aurora Store are Gboard (for swipe typing) and Google Voice (which works surprisingly well). I wondered if this was feasible for a U.S. android power user to cut the cord with Google and for the most part it seems viable. </p> <p>One challenge was finding a password manager that could import .csv files from my former password manager (aWallet Cloud) on my Pixel 6a. aWallet Cloud has a dependency on the Google Play Store, so does not work despite MicroG being installed. Bitwarden, Keeper, Lastpass, Nord, and Proton all did not work. Finally, I found 1Password that does work quite well with some fiddling. I don&#39;t care for its subscription model, however",
