<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>The title might not seem this being related to VR, but bear with me.</p> <p>My intention:</p> <p>I wanted to set up some music listening and rating environment within VRChat, so I can pick a pretty world to be in and listen to new music I got. I give every single track I have a five-star rating and set up foobar 2000 with hotkeys that can give the currently playing track a rating from 1 to 5. So for me, it isn&#39;t as easy as marking a track as favorite. Then, in VR, I wanted to set up some window capture and a nice big bar of buttons I can press to send that keyboard shortcut to foobar.</p> <p>My request:</p> <p>I need software / add-on / whatever that I can show as an overlay in VR with big buttons to press that sends keyboard shortcuts to the system. I could also just capture that window in VR via XSOverlay, and press one of the buttons to send something like ctrl+Num5 to the PC.</p> <p>The Problem:</p> <p>I looked at XSOverlay, OVR Toolkit and e

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have been delaying buying an VR headset waiting for the &quot;be all end all&quot; headset. Basically I would be playing sim racing games and that&#39;s it. Probably some corn as well. But the thing is, I always hear some complain about the headsets.</p> <p>Some say that the batteries are crap, others that the screendoor effect is still visible, others that the FOV is not good enough etc.</p> <p>So I was following Valve Index 2 news (Deckard) but eventually stopped as I did not see any real news so I started looking at the Quest 3. I remember ditching Quest because you needed a Facebook account but apparently this is not the case anymore, you need some &quot;Meta account&quot; whatever that is, which probably is annoying and anti privacy but I guess it&#39;s better than having some FB account. Im assuming this is not shared with anyone beyond the company itself. I still find it stupid that they would keep track of the usage of your headset.</p> <p>

## When did electrodes become so modern and different?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m mainly referring to things like the neural wristband and the galea headset. I thought EMG and eeg all used pads like the ones you can get from adafruit. Somehow I missed all this modern dry electrode stuff. It honestly seems like we are at the point where the limitation is software not hardware. Would not be surprised if normal vr games were to suddenly start supporting these sorts of devices. </p> <p>Edit: also do you guys know if anyone has attempted to use mental imagery rather than perceptual imagery as a method of control. Both galea and nextmind read data from the visual cortex. Research states that mental images are processed there alongside perceptual ones. I think a sigil type control structure would work well in a game setting. Is there anyone that you guys know of that tried that approach?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/TheRealBobbyJones"> /u/TheRealBobbyJones </a> <br/> <span

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi, in video games, it&#39;s pretty simple, put the crosshairs on the target, push the button to shoot, bullet goes where the crosshairs are pointing. </p> <p>Recently I&#39;ve been playing Zero Caliber 1, and it&#39;s completely not the case in that game.</p> <p>The bullets are consistently offset from where the sights are pointing. With iron sights, maybe we can blame my skill in lining them up, maybe not. But with dot sights and sniper scopes, the bullet literally always hits a certain amount below the crosshairs / dot.</p> <p>Funnily enough, the laser sights are pretty accurate, and when you have both laser and sniper scopes on a gun at the same time, you can see the laser definitely not pointing at where crosshairs are. </p> <p>Just in case this is a convergence issue, I&#39;ve tried looking at this at various ranges, and the laser dot is never at the crosshairs at any distance. </p> <p>I also couldn&#39;t see any method to adjust or zero the si

I did not beat the game yet, I just killed the first Behemoth and so far it’s fantastic on psvr2. I can’t really speak behalf of the people who played it before the patch. But in my experience, my current play-through seen minimum to no bugs. </p> <p>The game has a steep learning curve, you need to get grasp of the grappling hook and weapon handling quick, like walking dead fashion, the game is not very handholdy. </p> <p>All in all I can confidently recommend Behemoth for psvr2. </p> <p>I will post a full in-depth review after I am beat the game. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/FewPossession2363"> /u/FewPossession2363 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1h7oejw/behemoth_review_on_psvr2_after_day_1_patch/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/vi
