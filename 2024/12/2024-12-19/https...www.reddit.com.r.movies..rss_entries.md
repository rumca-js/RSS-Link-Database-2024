<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I was recommending this movie to a friend there other day, and wondered why no one ever talks about it today. I found it hilarious when I watched it and think it it one of the more funny movies of the 2010s. I know everybody isn’t a Andy Samberg fan, but I genuinely find him funny. Plus all the celebrity appearance make it a very fun and easy to watch movie. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Shit_stain14"> /u/Shit_stain14 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hi5grw/popstar_never_stop_never_stopping/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hi5grw/popstar_never_stop_never_stopping/">[comments]</a></span>

## Cate Blanchett's career is wild

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Cate Blanchett is in my opinion (and in the opinion of many film fans and critics) one of the absolute best Hollywood actors we have right now.</p> <p>But I find her career/film choices sometimes so wild. It is just mind-boggling for me how she switches so effortlessly between roles in thoughtful &quot;arthous-y&quot; films on the one end (stuff like Notes on a Scandal, Babel, I&#39;m Not There, Blue Jasmine, Carol and Tár), and Blockbusters and genre films on the other end (Lord of the Rings &amp; Hobbit, Indiana Jones 4, Robin Hood, Cinderella, Thor: Ragnarok, Ocean&#39;s 8, Borderlands). She also did many films that I would put in between these two categories (Elizabeth films, The Aviator, Nightmare Alley, Don&#39;t Look Up etc.).</p> <p>It just seems to me like she isn&#39;t snobby at all and very open to try very different types of roles, as long as it is either interesting or fun.</p> <p>Who are other actors that you think have a similar career

## The film Gulliver's Travels with Ted Danson is the closest adaptation of Jonathan Swift's book, but it still makes significant changes to the end of the story.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This is perhaps the only adaptation that shows Gilliver in Lilliput, in Brobdingnag a land inhabited by giants, the flying island Laputa and in the land of the horses Houyhnhnm.</p> <p>The adaptations focus more on Lilliput and some also dedicate themselves to showing Brobdingnag. But Laputa and the land of the intelligent dogs, Houyhnhnm are omitted in almost all adaptations.</p> <p>At the end of this film, Gulliver reconciles with his family and leaves his misanthropy behind, and in the book, Gulliver can no longer stand humanity and its vices and becomes a misanthrope.</p> <p>This adaptation wanted to offer a more optimistic ending to the story.</p> <p>Possibly the general public would not have liked to see Gulliver avoiding his wife and son, preferring the company of horses. This ending would have been very difficult to accept and so it was changed.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SensitiveEx

This journey has now come to an end - at least here on Reddit.</p> <p>Although I was never able to achieve the reach here that the original had right from the start, I would still like to thank everyone who took part with suitable suggestions, upvotes and downvotes as well as in various discussions.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Carry On was one of the most frustrating movies I have watched in ages. Not necessarily because the movie sucked (which it kinda did) but because every character, especially the protagonist Ethan acts like the biggest dumbass in the world. It is clear that no one in any of these situations would act even remotely in the way that was portrayed in the movie. </p> <p>Spoilers ahead:</p> <p><span class="md-spoiler-text">Like when the police shut security down and the TSA crew are all meeting to go over the protocol, the terrorists no longer have access to the cameras. Why not write something down to warn people? To get Nora safe? Sure Jason Batemen is listening but they can’t see anymore- he could literally just write the word terrorist on a piece of paper lol. Or a million other things for that matter. </span></p> <p><span class="md-spoiler-text">I think the worst has to be when Ethan literally disarms the bomb, but then puts it back together?? Why not
