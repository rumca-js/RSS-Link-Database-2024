For gaming they provide quick loading times, support the latest graphics, and as a bonus they produce less heat than the old-school mechanical drives I used to use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But having lost the data on an old HDD (hard disk drive) when it up and failed on me, I\u2019m now wondering about my SSDs\u2019 lifespans. My desktop gaming rig houses a pair that are about eight years old.

They\u2019re now seeking alternatives to YouTube TV that will provide comparable channel coverage for less.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, that sort of easy escape hatch doesn\u2019t exist. Like every other live TV service (<a href=\"https://www.techhive.com/article/1419277/think-streaming-price-hikes-are-bad-cables-are-even-worse.html\">including satellite and cable</a>), YouTube TV keeps raising prices because TV programmers keep demanding more money for their channels.
