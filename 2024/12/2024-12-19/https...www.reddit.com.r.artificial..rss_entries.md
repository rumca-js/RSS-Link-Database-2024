But it’s also easy to let one’s avoidance of being seen as an alarmist allow one to slide into a kind of obstinate denialism about some legitimate concerns about AI having huge effects on life and the global economy in ways not always beneficial or evenly shared.

It’s a sobering look at the challenges in aligning AI with human values.</li> <li>AGI Gaps: Generative AI is impressive, but experts like Microsoft’s Sarah Bird argue that we’re still far from AGI, with key gaps in understanding physical concepts.</li> </ul> <p>honestly It’s fascinating (and a bit unsettling) to see how far we’ve come and how much further we still have to go.</p> <p>But how do we balance innovation with safety when tackling something as complex as AGI?
