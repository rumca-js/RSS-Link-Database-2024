<p>This is why CNN asked Border Czar Tom Homan, "When will we actually start to see mass deportations happening?" So while the government often pretends they have urgency, this new administration actually does. That is why the network probably did not expect him to say, ‚ÄúDay One.‚Äù</p><p><br/></p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">CNN: So when will we actually start to see mass deportations happening?<br/><br/>Border Czar Tom Homan: "Day one." <a href="https://t.co/ULIbQsqxma">pic.twitter.com/ULIbQsqxma</a><br/>‚Äî Trump War Room (@TrumpWarRoom) <a href="https://twitter.com/TrumpWarRoom/status/1869574323431952828?ref_s
