While I really liked season 1 of <em>Silo</em>, season 2 has been a bore. We\u2019re halfway through\u2009\u2014\u2009five episodes\u2009\u2014\u2009and everything interesting could have been put in one episode. Maybe one and half. I hope the remaining five episodes of season 2 pick up, but so far, it really feels like this entire season has just padding",
