<p>Obsessing over pictures of yourself isn’t necessarily superficial. It’s almost inevitable, writes advice columnist Jessica DeFino</p><p><em>Hello Ugly,</em></p><p><em>Photos of myself make me shudder in horror. I focus on my eyes (small and pouchy) my skin (pasty) and my chin (large and spotty). Very Henry VIII! These are all ongoing insecurities, but day-to-day, I am content with how I look. Occasionally, I even feel pretty. So it’s hard not to be convinced, when I see a photograph of myself, that I am under a horrible illusion of being happily average-looking and am actually pretty hideous. This is made even worse when I see a photo as being terribly unflattering and others say it’s nice! I am aware this is quite superficial</em><em>, but it makes me really upset. Which is the truth here? Because surely an average-looking person would not have every photo looking so awful it actually hurts.</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2024/dec/19/photogenic-social-medi

<p>RaMell Ross’s artful and unconventional adaptation of Colson Whitehead’s novel offers a radically immersive route into a difficult story</p><p>• <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2024-in-culture">More on the best culture of 2024</a></p><p>Despite the necessity of filling in the gaps of Black American history, viewers could be forgiven for feeling a little fatigued, after a decade of highly worthy but often gruelling stories of slavery, civil rights abuses and institutional racism, from 12 Years a Slave to Till to The Hate U Give to Get Out, and many more besides.</p><p>Nickel Boys is something very different: rather than more “trauma porn”, it gives us direct emotion, poetic imagery and radical invention. It owes more to Terrence Malick and Gaspar Noé than Ava DuVernay.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/dec/19/best-movies-of-2024-in-the-us-no-2-nickel-boys">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A baby is abandoned outside a church in this compelling tale of love and moral crisis in 1960s rural Ireland</p><p>With his new novel, Niall Williams has created perhaps the most successful work of his career. Recalling Thomas Hardy in its deeply compassionate unravelling of moral crises set in the culture of the writer’s childhood rather than the reader’s present day – a time with a seemingly closer, more constricting relationship to moral absolutes and forbidden emotion – Time of the Child is a compellingly&nbsp;emotional experience that catches the breath and doesn’t let up until it reaches its final, dramatic conclusion.</p><p>The setting is the town of Faha in Ireland in 1962 –&nbsp;“a&nbsp;parish that had the character of the bottom of a pocket” (a wonderfully evocative description for anyone who has walked all day in a damp raincoat). It’s a place where “nothing ever happens”, and the same things keep on happening for ever. The first of two main&nbsp;protagonists, Dr Jack T

<p>Since the 1970s, Humphrey Smith has acquired scores of pubs and historic properties around the UK. But time after time, he has left the buildings empty. Why has he allowed his empire to moulder?</p><p>In early September 2022, Alivia Bienko and her husband, Liam, were driving through Stamford Bridge, an idyllic village on the River Derwent, near York, when a shuttered pub caught their eye. Stuck to one of the windows was an A4 sheet advertising for a couple to live in and manage the pub. On the advert was a mobile number for Samuel Smith, the brewery that owned the pub. Founded in 1758, Samuel Smith Old Brewery is one of the largest family-owned brewery and pub operations in the UK. Bienko had experience in hospitality, and she and Liam were open to a change. They decided to look into the job.</p><p>Online, they came across a few stories of couples who had been thrown out of their jobs running Samuel Smith’s pubs, largely for “missing money or missing beer”, Bienko said.
