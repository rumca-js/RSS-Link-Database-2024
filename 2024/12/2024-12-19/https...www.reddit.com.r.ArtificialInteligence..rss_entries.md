CONTINUE, on the other hand, is also being developed to handle multiple files and perform basic actions, but it offers the option to select specific code snippets and pass them as context, which saves on token costs. Using CLINE with Cloud Sonnet, in particular, is said to become quite expensive rather quickly. Do you have any personal experiences with either?
