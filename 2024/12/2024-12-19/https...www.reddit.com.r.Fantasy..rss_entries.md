Especially tropey ones. The whole thing with Simon becoming King and marrying the princess was great. As is the fact that certain characters go to live. I thought Joshua being alive was great (and the fact that it was his iron shackle that saved his life was a bonus) Also, I don‚Äôt know why, but I really thought Binibik was going to die‚Ä¶ So glad he didn‚Äôt!</p> <p>- This world is so beautiful and big. The prose really helps of course. It feels like a world that you could write a hundred stories in, with such a detailed past. The stuff with the Sithi in particular was quite well done, and I liked that a lot of the past as the characters knew it was kind of a lie, or exaggerated over time.</p> <p>- I don‚Äôt tend to like battle scenes a whole lot, but WOW c

Like two different dimensions almost. Hard to pass between the two realms. MFC came to the place where MMC lived in the beginning of the book, I don‚Äôt remember why or where she came from. They spent some time there and then went on a quest to defeat someone, a king I think, from the other realm. The king was bad and something he was doing was hurting the people in the MMC‚Äôs realm. I think they had some friends with them on this mission.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I just finished The Deed of Paksenarrion trilogy and well as the Legacy of Paksenarrion series by Elizabeth Moon and was hoping for suggestions for similar novels. I loved Moon‚Äôs depiction of paladins. Also, as someone who served in the modern military, I really enjoyed her very modern take of women serving in mixed armed forces in a fantasy setting in a believable fashion. I‚Äôm also a sucker for books such as these with strong, well written woman protagonists. I‚Äôm a man, but I grew up with three sisters and have been married for a very long time, so I feel I usually have decent radar for <a href="/r/menwritingwomen">r/menwritingwomen</a> shenanigans and am generally off-put them when I spot them in the wild.

I&#39;d heard it wasn&#39;t his best work(understandable given it&#39;s his debut), but I thought I&#39;d give it a shot</p> <p>I knew back when I read it that the book was trying to say a bunch of things, I just couldn&#39;t quite piece it all together. But it&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve read it and I&#39;ve had some time to mull over it all. Here&#39;s what I thought about it</p> <p>King Rat is, shockingly, the king of rats. But here&#39;s how he describes rats - &quot;my subjects are everywhere. And here in the cities there&#39;s a million crevices for my kingdom. I fill the spaces in between. I&#39;m the scavenger chief. I live where you don&#39;t want me&quot;</p> <p>So while the story refers to him as the king of the rats in the literal sense, conflating rats with those living in the margins of the city, feeding off of its left

I try to read 60 books a year, and there&#39;s so many books and series I want to read! I get paralyzed with choice when I have too many options, so I have lists, ordered and curated, of what I want to read. I don&#39;t have to choose, and I just read what&#39;s next, adding them to my holds at the library or purchasing as needed.</p> <p>My other fun thing is I like to create the ambiance with DND playlists or ambient instrumental playlists on Spotify, particularly for fantasy or sci fi books I&#39;m reading. It really helps me to focus on reading and immerse myself in the book (bonus points if it pairs with a joint or a glass of wine).</p> <p>Does anyone else do these things?? What else
