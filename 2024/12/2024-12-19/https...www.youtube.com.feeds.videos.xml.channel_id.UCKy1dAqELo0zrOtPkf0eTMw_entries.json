Narrated by Erik Adams.\n\nThey may have started on the wrong foot, but the Sonic the Hedgehog movies appear to be getting better as they go. Pushing further past the dopey buddy comedy of the original and the tiresome pop-culture references of its marginally better sequel, this third installment offers much more pleasing CGI, blessedly fewer human foibles, and a kind of tortured nega-Sonic in Shadow, a fan favorite antihero voiced by Keanu Reeves. The real draw, though, is Jim Carrey, coaxed out of supposed retirement to deliver a dual villain performance that doubles all the exaggerated comic pleasures of his ongoing turn as Dr. Robotnik.",

Case in point - the new trailer is crammed full of familiar faces from the DC Universe, both good and evil. This movie is set in a world where Superman and his fellow heroes have already been active for a few years, and it takes full advantage of that fact.\n\nWe see plenty of DC heroes and villains in this footage, including David Corenswet's Superman, Rachel Brosnahan's Lois Lane, Nicholas Hoult's Lex Luthor, Edi Gathegi's Mister Terrific, Isabela Merced's Hawkgirl, Nathan Fillion's Green Lantern Guy Gardner, and Anthony Carrigan's Metamorpho. And there are even some surprise inclusions like Krypto the Super-Dog and Kelex.\n\nDon\u2019t worry if you\u2019re not familiar with every DC character in this early footage. We\u2019re here to break down all the major players and what the trailer reveals about their respective roles in the first live-action DCU ",
