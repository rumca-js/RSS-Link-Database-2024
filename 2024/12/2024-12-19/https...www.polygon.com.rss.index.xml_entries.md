With this many Pals in one game, it can be hard to tell which ones are worth keeping or employing your base.</p>

<p>Pals have different <a href="https://www.polygon.com/guides/24043450/palworld-type-chart-element-strengths-weakenesses">elemental types</a> and work skills, making it so no two Pals are exactly alike. One may appear similar, but it may be better at completing a certain task over another.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I’ve been playing <em>League of Legends</em> since it was a plucky indie game run by a small crew, and while most things have changed over the last decade plus, one thing has always been consistent: <em>League</em> is a free-to-play game. Whether I’m on mobile or PC, I can hop on and crank out as many games as I please with no paywall, advertisements, or obstacles. But everything around the game itself, especially the champion cosmetics, has gotten more expensive and annoying to deal with.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For this writer’s money, the best cult DC Comics hit of the ’00s was <em>Secret Six</em>, a series about a team of superhumans whose rap sheets were too long to ever hang with real superheroes, but who were too annoyingly principled about little things like “human trafficking” or “murdering children” to ever hang with the real supervillains. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Secret Six will return in 2025, Polygon can reveal courtesy of DC Comics, in a new form with even more potential for hero-vs.-villain morality. Because the new team is comprised of three villains and three superheroes.</p>

<p>Nintendo, notoriously secretive, has so far said very little on the record about its next game console. As the Nintendo Switch celebrated its seventh birthday in March 2024, questions about how much longer it will last are natural: Seven years is a typical lifespan for a console generation, Switch sales are <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/474643/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-no-change" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.polygon.com/news/474643/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-no-change">falling fast</a>, and the technology powering the console is showing its age.</p>
