        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>A while back, I wrote a python script to get player prop betting lines from Prizepicks. Since then, demons and goblins have been released, which have different multipliers for bet slips. Goblins are always a lower betting line than the standard one, while demons are always higher. Also, you always have to pick higher on these bets.</p> <p>Anyways, I&#39;ve done some analysis on the prizepicks api responses for the projections, and they don&#39;t appear to include the multiplier for demons and goblins, only whether it is a demon or goblin. The only way to see how the demon/goblin will affect the bet slip is by selecting it on the app or website. That isn&#39;t a feasible way to find the the multiplier for EVERY demon/goblin projection offered on the app, since it would require way too many clicks on the website and would take forever.</p> <p>Any help on this problem would be greatly appreciated!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a hre",
