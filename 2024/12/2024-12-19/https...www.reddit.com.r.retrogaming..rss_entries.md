<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m looking for some games that are a gallery shooter but also a shmup kinda. The best way I can describe it is like the 2 base stages in contra. Mainly moving left and right but also forward and back ever so slightly. Or like in Aliens 4 on Final Burn Neo where at the beginning of the game you fight those aliens that are coming at you, and then the giant one comes out from the wall. I&#39;m so sorry if there is already a genre of games like this I just can&#39;t find anything on it. Thank you!!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Graydog1122"> /u/Graydog1122 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1hhlrtv/gallery_shooter_shmup/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1hhlrtv/gallery_shooter_shmup/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>When I was a kid in the 80s &amp; early 90s my dad had a wealthy friend that had a game room. I remember playing the state of the art Tyson’s Punchout on NES on one of the old bigscreens that had a sort of corrugated surface if you remember those. </p> <p>They also had an early console game that I played for hours and wish I could remember the name! Details are fuzzy in my head- paddle or joystick, b&amp;w or black and green- I dunno. Here’s what I remember:</p> <p>It was a small console, like mac classic sized. It only played the one game (I think). Scrolled left to right and you controlled a ship that shot and maybe bombed? It was one or two buttons only. </p> <p>It reminds me a lot of defender, but I’m pretty sure it was not in color and possibly a defender clone. I’m thinking it was early 80s and it felt like an early home setup for a wealthy person, it was definitely not set up to take quarters and it was on a table or stand- not a tall floor on

This wasn’t in the early ‘80s; it was 1991, just before everything changed. And let me tell you, it was mind-blowing.</p> <p>Instead of Disney characters, the game was filled with Soviet cartoon heroes. But there was one game in particular that I could never forget: hockey. And I hated hockey. But at that time, it didn’t even matter.
