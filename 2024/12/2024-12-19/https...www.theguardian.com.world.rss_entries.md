<p>Prime minister to be questioned on economy, public services and global affairs as No 10 says he spoke to Trump on the phone on Wednesday</p><p>Good morning. It is the last day the House of Commons is sitting before the Christmas recess, and the main event will be in a committee room in Portcullis House where Keir Starmer will have his first question session with the liaison committee, the prefects’ club comprising the chairs of all the other Commons select committees.

Most of them are Labour MPs, but they include people who have only become select committee chairs because, despite serving on the front bench before the election, they were not appointed ministers, and so it is wrong to assume they are all Starmer loyalists. In theory, 90 minutes of intelligent questioning with the PM should produce a decent amount of news. In the past liaison committ
