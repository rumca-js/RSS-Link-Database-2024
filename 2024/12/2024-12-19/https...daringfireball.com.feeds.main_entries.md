<p>Zack Rosenblatt, Dianna Russini, and Michael Silver have written a devastating profile of the most dysfunctional franchise in all of U.S. pro sports, the New York Jets, whose dysfunction has a clear and obvious root cause: meddling idiot owner Woody Johnson (heir to the Johnson &amp; Johnson pharmaceutical fortune). One example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A few weeks later, Douglas and his Broncos counterpart, George
Paton, were deep in negotiations for a trade that would have sent
Jeudy to the Jets and given future Hall of Fame quarterback Aaron
Rodgers another potential playmaker. The Broncos felt a deal was
near. Then, abruptly, it all fell apart. In Denver’s executive
