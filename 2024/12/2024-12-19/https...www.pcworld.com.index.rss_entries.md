<p>It’s getting late for online gift buying, and the holidays are almost here. If you’ve missed those shipping deadlines, you have one last resort – gift cards.</p>



<p>Yes, yes, we know, they’re not as personal, but they’re better than being empty-handed when your friend or family member tosses you a gift. And if we’re being fair, sometimes, gift cards are better than actually spending money on something your loved ones may not like, may not need, or may already have. In this way, whomever it is you’re shopping for has the chance to buy something they actually want.</p>



<p>From Amazon to Fortnite, from Best Buy to IKEA and Wendy’s, here’s a list of the best last-minute eGift cards we could find for you today.</p>

<p>Legacy machines run more of the world than you might think. Did you know that two Commodore C64s are still in daily use at the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hilligossbakery/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hilligoss Bakery</a> of Brownsburg, Indiana?</p>



<p>One user recently <a href="https://x.com/RetroVidGaming/status/1868587811517219090">posted some photos</a> on X (formerly Twitter) showing two C64s next to each other and being used to check out an order. Granted, the photos are over a decade old, but it’s still shocking to see C64s in real-world use even in 2010.</p>



<p>Several of the keys on the two C64s are labeled in color, and the machines have obviously been modified for use as POS systems. Each of the two is connected to a flat screen, presumably for space-saving reasons as CRT monitors would simply take up too much room.</p>

<p>As we head towards the end of the year, the Windows 11 24H2 update from October is still causing trouble for users. Microsoft has confirmed two new problems, and according to <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/microsoft-confirms-even-more-windows-11-24h2-bugs-audio-output-is-now-affected/">Neowin</a>, one of them breaks audio output and the other breaks Auto HDR.</p>



<p>The audio issue occurs on computers “from one manufacturer” (Microsoft didn’t elaborate further on <em>which</em> manufacturer) with Dirac Audio and the <code>cridspapo.dll</code>, which processes audio for improved clarity and precision. The bug causes Windows 11 to no longer be able to output sound to integrated speakers, Bluetooth speakers, headsets, and other audio devices. There’s currently no workaround for those affected.</p>



<p>The other confirmed issue involves a bug in Aut

<p>Chat GPT is not the only AI service in town. <a href="https://gemini.google.com/app">Google Gemini</a> is a similar service where you can ask questions and get answers in plain text–no commands required. You can “converse” just as if the AI robot were a real person.</p>



<p>If you’re familiar with Chat GPT, you’ll recognize it because the layout is similar. You’re greeted by a stripped-down screen with a text input field at the bottom. This is where you enter your prompts, i.e. questions and commands. The conversation itself doesn’t have to be about facts, Gemini can talk about anything. However, it’s important to remember that the answers aren’t always correct.</p>

<p>I couldn’t believe my eyes when I spotted the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Portable-External-MU-PH8T0S-AM/dp/B0CMDGGJTZ/">8TB Samsung T5 EVO portable SSD for just $400 right now</a> because that’s, by far, the best discount I’ve ever seen for it. (Before that, its best price was $430, so it’s quite the drop ahead of the holidays.)</p>



<p>We <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2124646/samsung-t5-evo-usb-ssd-review.html">reviewed the Samsung T5 EVO</a> some time ago and gave it a 4-star rating for its small and rugged body plus its decently fast performance. “The T5 EVO is 5Gbps (Gen 1) USB 3.2, meaning that no matter what’s inside, it’s basically capped at 550MB/s.”</p>



<p>Basically, while it may not be rocket-fast, it’s one of the few reliable portable SSDs to come in an enormous 8TB version. That’s an absolute ton of space! If you ne

<p>Why does Windows have to nag me all the time? It’s a question many PC users ask themselves. If you’re tired of seeing those little speech bubbles pop up in the bottom right-hand corner (aka Message Suggestions), you can actually switch that feature off–it’s pretty easy to do. </p>

<p>A multi-monitor setup can significantly increase your productivity, as it allows you to multitask with ease. If you’re working with such a setup, you can actually customize things like the refresh rate and resolution within Windows. This is how you do it. </p>



<p>To customize the display, right click anywhere on your desktop and select “Display Settings” from the menu. This is where you can adjust the aforementioned refresh rate, resolution, and alignment. First, let’s start with the alignment of your monitors. </p>



<p>If your mouse moves between the screens and stays in the same position, your monitors are correctly aligned. If not, drag the monitors (they appear as rectangles) in the Display Settings until they’re correctly aligned. Use the actual position of the monitors on your desk as a guide.</p>



<p>You can also adjust the brightness and col

<p>I’m getting tired of my laptop running just six to eight hours before it runs out of juice, so I’ve been extremely tempted these past couple of months to buy a new laptop featuring Qualcomm’s Arm-based Snapdragon X Plus or Snapdragon X Elite processor.</p>



<p>I have no doubt that if I swapped my six-hour-lasting x86-based laptop for one that goes for 20+ hours, I could get a lot more done in my day; plus, it would mean I don’t have to be near any kind of outlet when I travel this holiday season.</p>
