For sake of example, let&#39;s say I&#39;m using Switch joycons for this, and I rigged up a way to attach a Vive tracker to each one so that they can be tracked in my lighthouse setup. Would it be possible to use the joycons individually as VR controllers? Is there some special driver that would need to be installed to get it to work? Has anyone tried that before with a greater or lesser amount of success?</p> <p>Also, I should note here that I don&#39;t necessarily mean using Joycons. Ideally this would be applicable to any given controller. Two regular Xbox controllers for example, or the Xbox Adaptive Joystick.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32",

I\u2019m really excited to play Alien Rogue Incursion, but I feel like I should wait at least a month for some updates to fully enjoy the game.

However, I have a strong feeling that a remastered version with a full VR mode might be on the way, and I don\u2019t want to spoil the experience by playing the current version.</p> <p>I actually got into the Alien franchise when Rogue Incursion was announced.

Recently I decided to dust the Index off, buy prescription lenses for it, a pully system for the cord, and a counterweight and apache strap. It&#39;s really comfy now but the clarity is lacking I feel, it&#39;s not as crisp (plus there is a speck of something in the lens themselves, and I&#39;m pretty sure the lenses are lightly scratched from my glasses I used to wear with it) as I&#39;d like it to be and an just looking for something to maybe upgrade to.</p> <p>I mainly only play VRchat, blade and sorcery and a few other VR games but if I mainly those two atm, definitely out the most hours in VRchat. I have 3 Vive 3.0&#39;s for FBT as well.</p> <p>I&#39;m also blind out of my left eye and my prescription is on the high end, meaning I need to get prescription lenses custom made (my only experience is with VR lens lab, which I think did an excellent job ",

Not all my .mkv files worked with big screen, so maybe I&#39;ll buy Skybox. However it became clear that sub 1080p video files are beyond watchable like this. I have few very old 1080p movie files on my pc and it seems to be allright, I think I can watch a whole movie with it, but I guess that in case of VR, better resolution would really benefit a lot.</p> <p>So the question is, where to get 4k movies, to watch with my headset?
