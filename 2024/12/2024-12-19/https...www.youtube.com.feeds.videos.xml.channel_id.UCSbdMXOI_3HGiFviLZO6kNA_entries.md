Hello and welcome to... TUESDAY NEWSDAY! Your number one resource for the entire week's worth of VR news! Today we have some pretty huge news that I've been waiting for- for years. AndroidXR, Google's official branch of Android purposed for AR and VR devices has been announced. I think it will have a ton of ramifications long term; especially for Meta and the Quest line of headsets.. but this also has a ton of ramifications for other players in the industry. In more immediate news, Vision Pro receives some really great news, Quest 3 and 3s receive a big update with V72 and PSVR2 may be getting hand tracking! 

And to top it all off- an opinion piece on Valve's new headset (hopefully?) set to be announced next year. 

I hope you have an amazing rest of 2024 and great holidays. I will be back making content full time in 2025.
