<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>My renewal came and went on Black Friday, I just realized that at some point this year I cancelled my renewal, I vaguely remember some drama but could someone refresh my memory? I have NewsDemon Unlimited still at something like $3/mo, so I cant even remember if Frugal is on the same backbone as ND and having both unlimited plans would be a waste or not. </p> <p>I have block accounts of various ages with Astraweb, Cheapnews, and UsenetExpress. I have been doing newsgroups for something like 17 years and just buy a block when I see it on sale sometimes for sh*ts and giggles, if they have no time limits. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/stratospaly"> /u/stratospaly </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1hhzo9n/can_someone_explain_the_frugal_issue_to_me/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1hhzo9n/can_someone_explain_the_fruga
