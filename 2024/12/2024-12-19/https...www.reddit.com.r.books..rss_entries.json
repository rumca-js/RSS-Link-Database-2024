It highlights the deep and enduring persecution that native peoples have faced and still face in a way that does not shy away from the harsh realities of the atrocities that were perpetrated against the many Native populations. As a white woman, I felt a deep sense of shame about the way that Natives were, and are still treated. A recurring theme is the desecration of bodies and how the Choctaw, and other Native populations were interred, bought and sold as cheap novelties. The underlying tone is of deep disgust and highlights how even today, hundreds of thousands of Native skeletons are kept in museums and private collections. </p> <p>The main character Detective Monique Bluehawk is a compelling and determined character who is grappling with the difference between fact and myth and how those intersect with her heritage.

I said &quot;fictional&quot; because it&#39;s more normal to experience pain when you read someone&#39;s memoir about, say, losing a parent as a child or their beloved pet. Because you know it happened. But that&#39;s what&#39;s powerful about fiction, an author can make you care about characters that are not real.</p> <p>I remember reading The Outsiders as a young person at school. We were assigned the book, and recall really being affected by the death of <span class=\"md-spoiler-text\">Johnny and Dally.</span> Each one was painful in its own way.
