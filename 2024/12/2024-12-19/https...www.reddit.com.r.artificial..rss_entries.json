But it\u2019s also easy to let one\u2019s avoidance of being seen as an alarmist allow one to slide into a kind of obstinate denialism about some legitimate concerns about AI having huge effects on life and the global economy in ways not always beneficial or evenly shared. What lots of people tend to do is console themselves by pointing out all of the things AI can\u2019t do. But that\u2019s a foolishly complacent line of thinking.

It\u2019s a sobering look at the challenges in aligning AI with human values.</li> <li>AGI Gaps: Generative AI is impressive, but experts like Microsoft\u2019s Sarah Bird argue that we\u2019re still far from AGI, with key gaps in understanding physical concepts.</li> </ul> <p>honestly It\u2019s fascinating (and a bit unsettling) to see how far we\u2019ve come and how much further we still have to go.</p> <p>But how do we balance innovation with safety when tackling something as complex as AGI?
