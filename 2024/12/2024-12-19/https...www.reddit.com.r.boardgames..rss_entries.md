I enjoy Arkham&#39;s occassional RNG hit on player morale given the Lovecraft theme, but for for RC I am not sure how over the top the RNG is (as I&#39;ve read) or if the mechanics are that convoluted.

I do not want however to struggle each time with mechanics as if min maxing is the game. Is RC a good fit? Or does it

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>My girlfriend and I got the game Struggle For Catan a few weeks ago and I haven’t one a single game whenever we play because she somehow is so good at it. She keeps getting the City Expansion card that says “when building, you may replace 1 of the required resource cards with a different type of resource card (1x per turn)”. We have only played two players but in my opinion this card is just too OP because it can override any card.</p> <p>Any tips for this game or recommendations to be better at it?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ItsJustJohnCena"> /u/ItsJustJohnCena </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1hhgpkr/tips_for_struggle_for_catan/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1hhgpkr/tips_for_struggle_for_catan/">[comments]</a></span>
