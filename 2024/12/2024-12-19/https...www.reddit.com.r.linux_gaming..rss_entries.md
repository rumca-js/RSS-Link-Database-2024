<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi folks, I’ve tried to do my research but this seems an actively evolving and unclear topic for my situation- and perhaps the best choice for me is to simply wait.</p> <p>I am using Pop_OS with an Nvidia graphics card, and my monitor supports HDR. I enabled Wayland as from what I can tell it is definitively required, but the rest is unclear:</p> <p>If I use gamescope, does that suffice to get HDR? Do recent versions of Proton take care of it for applicable games? The combo of Proton+Gamescope? Do I absolutely need to switch to Plasma 6 right now, and if so does Gamescope become unnecessary?</p> <p>Part of me is under the impression that I should just wait for Cosmic to eventually support it, then upgrade, but it seems this feature slipped from the first release next year. I’m not sure if there’s info on when it is expected to be available.</p> <p>Also my monitor supports G-sync, and I’m insure of a few things there- does HDR change any of the guidan

Yet, with latest everything (ge-proton9-21, dxvk-2.5.1, vkd3d-proton-2.14, dxvk-nvapi-v0.8.0) Cyberpunk 2077 still greys out the FG option. When added to Steam as a non-Steam game and forced through Proton, it works just fine.</p> <p>Is Bottles lagging behind Steam in this regard? Or am I missing an option somewhere?
