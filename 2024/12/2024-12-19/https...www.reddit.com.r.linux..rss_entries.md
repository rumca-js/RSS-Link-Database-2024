<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello! I am sure I rmwill receive biased answers but that is okay.</p> <p>I love gaming, but I also love development. I dont really like gaming on Linux as it has issues and lack of true support, but I also hate developing on windows due to its weird ways of working.</p> <p>I want to not dual boot. But if it is recommended I don&#39;t have an issue.</p> <p>Reason for post is to help me make a decision, should I dual boot? Run only Linux and sacrifice some games/quality of life reasons for gaming? Or just use Windows even though development is not a good feeling?</p> <p>I will use Ubuntu 24.04 LTS for linux and of course Windows 11...</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Sir-Niklas"> /u/Sir-Niklas </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1hi0xao/assistance_on_choice/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1hi0xao/assistance_on_choice/">[
