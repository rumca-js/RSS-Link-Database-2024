<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Good evening people of Reddit,</p> <p>My name is Danny Mouso and I recently published a book called Melancholy. It is a collection of short stories and poems. The book is published on Amazon, a link is included, and the <strong>eBook is currently free</strong>. till the 20th, The stories inside mainly focus on the psychology of various characters and how they deal with their problems. The main themes I could describe in the book have thriller-like tropes and dark thoughts with some light-hearted content in between focusing on the psychology of each character and their story. It is a collection of stories I started writing for fun at 16 till 19. It shows my progress as a writer and is the first book with more to come in time. I hope those who pick it up enjoy it.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I only recently read harry potter and I loved it, I read all of them in three weeks. </p> <p>Does anyone know of any really good books series? I want them to be long and to have a really good story line. It doesn&#39;t necessarily have to be like harry potter, only mentioned it because of how many books there are and how long the lasts one are. I like thriller, drama mystery, horror and I don&#39;t exactly know what genre harry potter is (fantasy? Adventure?) but I liked it. Not really interested in romance or comedy, there can be a bit of romance and a bit of comedy but I don&#39;t want the books to be based on that. Thank you in advance!!!</p> <p>Btw I would prefer books that are originally written in English, it&#39;s just that I don&#39;t think some things always translate properly (like jokes) and they either change it completely or just translate it and it doesn&#39;t make sense.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi! Not sure if a book like this exists but I&#39;m looking for a fictional book with a female main character who is depressed and goes on a journey of finding happiness in the mundane aspects of life. Where she learns to enjoy solitude and the routines of life. Something cozy. Where she learns to do small things for herself that help her find herself. Maybe even about finding meaningful friendships. Not sure if this makes any sense.</p> <p>I haven&#39;t read it but The Wedding People by Alison Espach sounds like it might be somewhat similar to what I&#39;m looking for, but would appreciate any suggestions!

I grew up in the Harry Potter generation and loved stories around magic and dragons (Eragon was one of my favorites). I also loved dystopian novels like Hunger Games, Uglies, and The Giver. I don&#39;t even watch TV or movies anymore, I mostly work and then come home, take care of chores, spend time with the family, and go to bed. Having something to read will be a nice change of pace. </p> <p>Help me find a good book.

For now am sticking to paper based books as I have never been an avid reader, thus have been frequenting the local library. I am looking for more writers with a similar story telling style with well described smut scenes. Any other suggestions to books along this line? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Feliciathewombat"> /u/Feliciathewombat </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1hhk49z/looking_for_more_like_jilly_cooper_smut_based/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1hhk49z/looking_for_more_like_jilly_cooper_smut_based/">[comments]</a></span>

## Books that turn death into an adventure

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I struggle so much with the concept of death even as an adult. Obviously I understand what death is and it‚Äôs permanenance but I feel like I can‚Äôt accept death because I have no idea what happens next. Last year I read ‚ÄúUnder the Whispering Door‚Äù by TJ Klune and I absolutely fell in love with it. It‚Äôs a fantasy story about a ferryman that guides someone in the afterlife. He helps the main character accept his death and cross over in almost a whimsical way. No mention of religion, heaven, or hell. Just an adventure with room for reflection on our actions in life. I was hoping to find similar books to read!</p> <p>Thank you :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SadbutRad0000"> /u/SadbutRad0000 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1hhimyo/books_that_turn_death_into_an_adventure/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/commen

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Im a big reader and my boyfriend is (sadly) not :( I‚Äôve wanted to share this part of me with him for so long because I do think if he found the right book he would enjoy it.</p> <p>I‚Äôm a big fantasy reader and would love to find a fantasy/sci fi that he would also love. Last year I had him read Red Rising by pierce brown, because I personally found them very addicting and fast paced, which I thought would be good for someone who hasn‚Äôt read for fun since childhood. Well, he read red rising and Goldon Son, but, but DNFed Morning Star. He said he enjoyed the first two but somehow lost interest in the third booküò©</p> <p>Hes a big anime person, Hunter x Hunter and Attack on Titan being his favorites. Maybe im stubborn and simply want him to read a fantasy or sci fi book because its what i find myself enjoying most, but considering his love for different kinds of fantasy tv shows and anime I‚Äôm fairly certain theres something out there he would enjoy. </p>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a NEET that lives in a pretty small town. I have few friends, no female companionship, and am quite stricken with anxiety. My life for seemingly forever at this point has been full of isolation and loneliness, feeling utterly disconnected from the world, unable to even find much to do outside, and thus being stuck online, in circles that barely solve any issues, if any at all. I&#39;d like to get some book recommendations based upon that, as I want to read about a lonely character I resonate with.
