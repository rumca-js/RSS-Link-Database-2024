        "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Derek Chauvin's legal team is pushing for a new trial. I'll explain why, if he gets one, he'll likely be acquitted. An adult entertainment company prepares to pull out of Florida after their age verification law goes into effect.

And San Francisco's new fat acceptance czar explains why it's fatphobic to ask for a smaller slice of cake.\n\nTIMESTAMPS:\n\n00:00 - 00:25 Opening\n01:53 - 19:35 Why Derek Chauvin Deserves a New Trial (And Will Win It)\n22:27 - 35:00 This Company Is Leaving Florida Thanks To New Age Verification Law\n35:01 - 47:03 Fat Positivity Consultant Says No One Has To Be Healthy\n48:55 - 1:03:44 The Few Remaining Flat-Earthers Are Canceled\n\nEp.1506\n\n- - -\n\nBecome a DailyWire+ member and watch the full show: https://bit.ly/4bEQDy6\n\nLIKE & SUBSCRIBE for new videos every day. https://www.youtube.com/c/MattWalsh?sub_confirmation=1\n\n- - ",
