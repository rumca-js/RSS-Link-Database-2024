I was so worried I completely reformatted my drive and reinstalled windows using the windows MCT about a month ago and have had no issues, but I still remain anxious when using my PC! I feel like I&#39;ve lost all my confidence in using computers, which isn&#39;t great because I will be going to university for computer science next year. I would appreciate some reassurance about the likelyhood of malware remaining after a clean reinstall of windows (I am aware of BIOS malware but less worried about it since it is rare and usually targets people of importance).
