## Librewolf with appropriate settings or Firefox + uBlock

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Question first: can I use Librewolf with appropriate settings as a Firefox + uBlock substitute? </p> <p>Background: I&#39;m a big believer in &quot;don&#39;t shit where you sleep.&quot; I previously browsed casually with Brave and sailed with recommended Firefox settings, but I grew tired of Brave&#39;s AI generated answers. I lost my mind when I wanted a simple list of all 50 states, and it kept pushing links further and further down.</p> <p>Firefox&#39;s Sync is loads better than Brave&#39;s, and for reasons, I use an iPhone. I&#39;d prefer to use Firefox as my casual browsing browser and sail with Librewolf.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m wanting to set up a local server to connect to to stream my archived content to. From what I have found Jellyfin is likely the best program for it. I&#39;ve read through some of the well written guides on it, but still have a few questions. </p> <p>First, the consensus seems to be that the server doesn&#39;t need to be that powerful. Most guides say a cheap/old pc will work fine, some even saying raspberry pi can handle it. The only exception being for transcoding, which prefers to use a gpu to prevent the cpu from being overworked. How often is transcoding needed? as I understand it that is switching formats right? eg .webm to .mp4 right? is this needed if I consistently stick to a certain format? And if I do want to include transcoding capabilities in my set up, if I use a raspberry pi how do I get that to use a gpu? I&#39;ve never worked with a raspberry pi, but looking them up they lack a pcie connection for a gpu. I have an old nvidea ..

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>With news of the Adobe price hikes, I&#39;m finally biting the bullet and moving away into a more wallet friendly option of Lightroom Classic and Adobe Photoshop 2025.</p> <p>My question is, to people who have made this move before: how easy is it? I&#39;m wondering in terms of transferring Lightroom Classic catalogs, presets, all that sort of thing? Will I have to re-upload all my photos to the new pirated Lightroom catalog, or is there a way to save my catalog from the paid version, and that will be easily accessible in the pirated version? Anything I should do in order to make the transition easy?</p> <p>Also, will I have to do the same thing every time I want to update to a new version of Lightroom Classic?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/njpc33"> /u/njpc33 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1hhx1e0/switching_from_paid_adobe_to_paidless_adobe/">[link]</a></span

Recently been getting my favourite shows on a Samsung 1TB hard drive and noticed that when watching on my TV (hard drive connected to TV via usb) I have to manually switch off subtitles when playing any episode. I downloaded all of Fraiser, and I&#39;ve been into the folder and all of the episodes are MKV files, no separate subtitles files anywhere. When I play the file on my laptop via the default Media Player, there&#39;s no subtitles automatically. But when I play from my hard-drive through the TV, automatic subtitles. Turning off every episode is kind of annoying, and I want torrenting to completely replace my dependency on streamers. </p> <p>Anyone able to suggest how to achieve this?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been using various sites, Fmovies, Braflix, and recently Netplayz, because those were some of the only worked, a lot of the ones listed on fmhy just don&#39;t work for me, or have horrible quality. I&#39;ve even recently tried Stremio, only for most of the players to not load, and to hear the main debrider has had issues.</p> <p>It really feels like an uphill battle, I just want to watch older shows without paying an arm and a leg, but every time I find a site that works, it&#39;s taken down a few months later.</p> <p>Is there an alternative to constantly changing sites every time they&#39;re shut down? Or is there some trick to making Stremio work? Basically, how do you guys pirate stuff, as I&#39;m finding it really hard these days.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Rat-king27"> /u/Rat-king27 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1hhgi7g/cant_seem_to_find_any

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><strong>TL;DR - Use to get emails from ISP on behalf of companies telling me to stop pirating, will a VPN help with this? How did they even find out?</strong></p> <p>About 2 years ago I received emails from my ISP on behalf of companies like WWE and 20th Century Fox for pirating their content. All they did was tell me to delete their content off my computer and refrain from pirating in the future to prevent legal action taken against me.</p> <p>Needless to say I&#39;ve very rarely pirated anything since then. I&#39;ve mostly been sticking to on demand networks like Netflix and streaming sites.</p> <p>However, watching any movie or show through a mostly legitimate route has gotten <strong>really annoying.</strong></p> <p>They have movies and shows from literally the same series fragmented between up to 5 - 6 different streaming networks. I&#39;m trying to watch Jurassic World right now and for some reason Netflix only has the 2nd movie out of 4 and th
