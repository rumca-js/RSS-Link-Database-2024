It tells the story of a 15-year-old boy, living in postwar Germany, who falls into a passionate love affair with an older woman. Later he discovers that his former lover was a guard in a Nazi concentration camp.</p><p>Since then, Schlink has published two short story collections and a series of novels: some literary fiction and some crime. Like The Reader, most of these books explore the difficulties of trying to lay the past to rest. This new novel returns again to themes of memory, trauma and the impossibility of reconciliation.
