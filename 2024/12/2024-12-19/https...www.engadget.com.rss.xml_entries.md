<p>The Occupational Safety and Health Administration has reached a settlement with Amazon about alleged hazardous workplace conditions at ten of the tech giant's facilities. Under the terms of the settlement, Amazon will pay a penalty of $145,000 and must implement "corporate-wide ergonomic measures" to reduce the risk of worker injuries. OSHA will also continue inspecting the facilities for the next two years. On the government side of the agreement, OSHA is <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/workplace/osha-ergonomic-citations-vacated-amazon-health-safety" data-original-link="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/workplace/osha-ergonomic-citations-vacated-amazon-health-safety">withdrawing</a> nine of its ten ergonomic citations against the company.</p>

<p>Swiss Re analyzed liability claims from collisions covering 25.3 million miles driven by Waymo’s autonomous cars. The study also compared Waymo’s liability claims to human driver baselines based on data from over 500,000 claims and over 200 billion driving miles. The results found that Waymo Driver “demonstrated better safety performance when compared to human-driver vehicles.”.</p

<p>When Apple put its new M4 chip in the iPad Pro <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apples-m4-chip-arrives-with-a-big-focus-on-ai-142448428.html">before adding it to a MacBook</a>, that was a pretty clear sign that tablets are more than just idle couch companions. But with just one or two ports, you’ll need a hub if you want to maximize that potential. The same goes for laptops: they can be more powerful than desktops, but they almost always have fewer ports. USB-C hubs give you some combo of extra USB, HDMI, memory card, Ethernet and/or 3.5 mm ports so you can connect peripherals like monitors or wired mice and keyboards. You can hook up external drives for more storage — some hubs even have memory card slots. We tested 15 different USB-C hubs to see how they perform and put the best of what we tested below.</p>

However, the bill gives DJI an extra year to prove to an &quot;appropriate national security agency&quot; that its products don&#39;t pose a national security risk in the US.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Failing that, the bill authorizes the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to place DJI&#39;s drones on its covered list for 2026, meaning retailers would no longer be able to import them.
