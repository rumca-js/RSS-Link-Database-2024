We bought the Thermaltake Vista 470M for $1,700 from their website to review the pre-built gaming PC without Thermaltake knowing. We've previously bought Starforge, Corsair, iBUYPOWER, Dell, Maingear, HP, and other pre-built gaming PCs and, overall, we've had bad luck finding good ones. After our experience with NZXT's Flex rental PC, we decided to actively try and find good prebuilt PCs. We have several on the way or in for testing already, and this is one of the first that passed our testing. One of the others failed, and a third looks promising. That's 2 of 3! Sadly, a good rate for prebuilts. The Thermaltake Vista 470M has an AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D and NVIDIA RTX 4070 Super GPU, making it one of the more powerful prebuilts we've bought despite its more reasonable price (as compared to the $5000 computers we've purchased and reviewed).
