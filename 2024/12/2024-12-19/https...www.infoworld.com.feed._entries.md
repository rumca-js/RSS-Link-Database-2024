<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-is-bluesky">What is Bluesky? </h2>



<p><a href="https://bsky.app/">Bluesky</a> is a “microblogging” social media network similar to X (formerly Twitter), where people can publish posts with a maximum of 300 characters, as well as follow others, create lists, like posts, and so on. “Similar to Twitter” makes sense, because Bluesky was originally a project within Twitter to develop a more open and decentralized social network. Bluesky’s <a href="https://atproto.com/">AT Protocol</a> is open source.</p>



<p>Bluesky started as an invitation-only network last year and opened to the public in early 2024.</p>
