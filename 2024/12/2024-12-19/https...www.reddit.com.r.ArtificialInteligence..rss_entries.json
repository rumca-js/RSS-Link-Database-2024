I know there\u2019s a paid feature on ChatGPT, but I\u2019m wondering if it is worth it because it says the ChatGPT plus just includes real time Google searches ; which in don\u2019t need, ( someone said on the new ChatGPT it allows you to create project files and then you upload the documents on there. ) but I\u2019m wondering what is gonna be the difference because I\u2019ve already personalize my ChatGPT to know the project that I\u2019m currently working on and Ive uploaded the documents that I previously sent so is it worth it??

I\u2019ve heard that CLINE is supposed to be better at handling multiple files, but it comes with significant resource consumption, and it isn\u2019t possible to select specific code snippets and use only those as context for a chat query. CONTINUE, on the other hand, is also being developed to handle multiple files and perform basic actions, but it offers the option to select specific code snippets and pass them as context, which saves on token costs. Using CLINE with Cloud Sonnet, in particular, is said to become quite expensive rather quickly. Do you have any personal experiences with either?

I also need to be able to upload a pdf article and have it summarize it for me or ELI5. I use Chatgpt and gemini for this now and i\u2019m satisfied with both of them. I havent had the opportunity to converse with an AI app yet. I want to be able to converse with it while i\u2019m for example driving. Ask it questions and it\u2019ll answer them, etc. chatgpt doesnt do this for me (i think because i\u2019m using free version) and while i have the paid version of gemini, i havent figured out jow to go to audio mode. I\u2019m using the Google app. Maybe i need the Gemini app.</p> <p>So, which AI app would you recommend? The lower the cost the better.
