You may have heard that the US government has a bit of a mess on its hands after House Speaker Mike Johnson worked out a somewhat carefully crafted compromise continuing resolution funding plan to keep the government open, only to have it collapse after Elon Musk screamed about how bad it was and how anyone [&#8230;]

As we mentioned yesterday, our crowdfunding campaign for One Billion Users is in its final hours.

And just in time, Adi Robertson at The Verge has written a very nice review of [&#8230;]

We’ve documented in detail how the whole AT&#38;T–&#62;Time Warner–&#62;Warner Brothers Discovery merger process&#160;has been a pointless mess, resulting in no limits of layoffs and damage to the underlying brands.
