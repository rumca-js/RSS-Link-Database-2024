The prose really helps of course. It feels like a world that you could write a hundred stories in, with such a detailed past. The stuff with the Sithi in particular was quite well done, and I liked that a lot of the past as the characters knew it was kind of a lie, or exaggerated over time.</p> <p>- I don\u2019t tend to like battle scenes a whole lot, but WOW c",

I loved Moon\u2019s depiction of paladins. Also, as someone who served in the modern military, I really enjoyed her very modern take of women serving in mixed armed forces in a fantasy setting in a believable fashion. I\u2019m also a sucker for books such as these with strong, well written woman protagonists. I\u2019m a man, but I grew up with three sisters and have been married for a very long time, so I feel I usually have decent radar for <a href=\"/r/menwritingwomen\">r/menwritingwomen</a> shenanigans and am generally off-put them when I spot them in the wild.
