I&#39;m a part of this community for around 3 years now (though I joined it pretty recently). I thought I might give a try creating my own selfhosted software but I can&#39;t think of anything. I played around privately with Python and Flask for some time now, and I think I&#39;m capable of creating something that will be actually useful for someone. So my question is: <strong>is there any specific selfhosted software that you want to have but there just isn&#39;t one yet, or it&#39;s not right for you?</strong></p> <p>I want to create a project that I can actually develop and update for more than a couple days (best if it would be months or even years if i&#39;ll have time for that long), and it shouldn&#39;t be something as complex as Nextcloud or Gitea/Forgejo (at least in the beginning), probably something more like Uptime Kuma or a metasearch engine.</p> <p>I&#39;m looking forward to your ideas! </",

All seems to work while I am in my home network, but when i use any other network, just stops working. I have port forwarded the listening port (51820) as UDP with the correct ip address. I have tried disabling the proxmox firewall, same problem persists. Any fix?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Qobyl\"> /u/Qobyl </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1hhhjeo/wireguard_port_forwarding_not_working/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1hhhjeo/wireguard_port_forwarding_not_working/\">[comments]</a></span>",
