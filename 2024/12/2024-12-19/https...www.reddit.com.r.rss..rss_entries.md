<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I wanted to follow some blogs but never found an RSS reader that was (1) free, (2) dead simple and (3) wouldn&#39;t bug me to buy premium ever time I logged in.</p> <p>So I made <a href="https://rss-reader.dutl.uk/">https://rss-reader.dutl.uk/</a>. It doesn&#39;t even have a login, you put in the feeds you want to tune into and click fetch. Save the URL, and you&#39;re good to go.</p> <p>The feeds and preferences are saved on the URL parameters. It can be a bit slow for larger feeds but that was not a concern to me as a user. I&#39;ve been using this as my main and only RSS reader for around 4 months and I decided to share it here and ask for feedback / suggestions.</p> <p>Example URL with feeds: <a href="https://rss-reader.dutl.uk/?feeds=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.benjojo.co.uk%2Frss.xml%2Chttps%3A%2F%2Fxkcd.com%2Frss.xml&amp;ttl=720">https://rss-reader.dutl.uk/?feeds=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.benjojo.co.uk%2Frss.xml%2Chttps%3A%2F%2Fxkcd.com%2Frss.xml&amp;ttl=720<
