        "description": "Churchill Mortgage - Connect With A Home Loan Specialist you can trust today at: https://churchillmortgage.com/shapiro \n\nIf there\u2019s a government shutdown, who will be blamed? Ben discusses the continuing resolution taking place within Congress to try and avoid hitting the debt ceiling in 2025. Congress is considering a spending bill that would give sweetheart provisions for government censors, make it easier to hide the records of the corrupt Jan 6th committee, and also give Congress a pay increase. Trump would love the debt ceiling to go away so when he takes office, he can pass new bills without worry. However, Democrats are now opposing a clean continuing resolution and will continue to oppose any federal spending bill that strays from the deal already announced. \n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Click here to join the member-exclusive portion of my show: https://bit.ly/3WDjgHE\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 It\u2019s your LAST CHANCE to take advantage of our best sale of the year!

        "description": "Helix Sleep - Get an exclusive discount at https://helixsleep.com/Ben\n\nBen discusses the big problem for Democrats after the election: Should they slip more to the left or move back more to the center? Their battle for the democratic left is very much alive, and it is being discussed that they need to start being led by a younger demographic. Ben also talks about the bipartisan deal on the floor to keep the government funded through mid-March and provide more than $100 Billion in relief to disaster victims and farmers. House Republicans are ticked off at what is just another \u201cpork bill,\u201d but it needs to pass so the government is funded when Trump comes into office. Trump does not want a government shutdown on the table when he enters office. He would prefer the government to be funded through March and then use his power to get wavering Republicans to sign on to bills. \n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Click here to join the member-exclusive portion of my show: https://bit.ly/3WDjgHE\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Finish your Christmas ",
