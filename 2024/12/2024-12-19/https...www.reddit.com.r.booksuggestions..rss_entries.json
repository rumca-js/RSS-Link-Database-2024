It is a collection of short stories and poems. The book is published on Amazon, a link is included, and the <strong>eBook is currently free</strong>. till the 20th, The stories inside mainly focus on the psychology of various characters and how they deal with their problems. The main themes I could describe in the book have thriller-like tropes and dark thoughts with some light-hearted content in between focusing on the psychology of each character and their story. It is a collection of stories I started writing for fun at 16 till 19. It shows my progress as a writer and is the first book with more to come in time. I hope those who pick it up enjoy it.

It doesn&#39;t necessarily have to be like harry potter, only mentioned it because of how many books there are and how long the lasts one are. I like thriller, drama mystery, horror and I don&#39;t exactly know what genre harry potter is (fantasy? Adventure?) but I liked it. Not really interested in romance or comedy, there can be a bit of romance and a bit of comedy but I don&#39;t want the books to be based on that. Thank you in advance!!!</p> <p>Btw I would prefer books that are originally written in English, it&#39;s just that I don&#39;t think some things always translate properly (like jokes) and they either change it completely or just translate it and it doesn&#39;t make sense.

Thanks to my depression and adhd (makes communication &amp; connection difficult / lowers EQ) it\u2019s like I woken up and I\u2019m an alien in my life who doesn\u2019t <em>really</em> know the people around him.</p> <p>Some books have helped me understand things better, and I\u2019m making improvements.

Okay so for context I was an extremely avid reader growing up- as in I loved reading so much that I would literally sit on the playground, hunched over my book reading for the entire recess. I read Harry Potter at 8, Animal Farm at 12, was obsessed with Percy Jackson for a bit. Ive always loved reading, especially fiction, but I could never properly focus on non fiction because I found it boring- even on topics that really intrested me. Anyway, lately, in the past few years, I feel like I havent been reading as much because of school and social media but I feel like in the last couple of months Ive really gotten back into reading. Like before, I would read maybe 2 books per month. Lately, for example over the autumn break, I finished 15. I just truly love book and Im really ha",

In terms of fantasy, I&#39;ve read some fantasy books like The Poppy War trilogy, The Mortal Instruments series but all of them are leaning toward YA. For my next reads, I&#39;m eager to read more epic, adventurous, and brutal adult/mature high fantasy books that at least have morally ambiguous characters. Looking forward for all of your recommedations!\u2618\ufe0f</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/apeculiarreader\"> /u/apeculiarreader </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1hholc5/suggest_a_high_fantasy_book_for_a_beginner_like_me/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1hholc5/suggest_a_high_fantasy_book_for_a_beginner_like_me/\">[comments]</a></span>",

The issue is, I haven&#39;t read for fun since high school, maybe even earlier, and I have no idea what to get. I&#39;ve always loved fantasy and just fiction in general. I grew up in the Harry Potter generation and loved stories around magic and dragons (Eragon was one of my favorites). I also loved dystopian novels like Hunger Games, Uglies, and The Giver. I don&#39;t even watch TV or movies anymore, I mostly work and then come home, take care of chores, spend time with the family, and go to bed. Having something to read will be a nice change of pace. </p> <p>Help me find a good book. I have always loved druidic magic, arthurian legend, norse mythology (honestly most mythology is fun), and pre industrial historical fiction (modern technology is boring, lol). </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Lunas-lux\"> /u/Luna",

Obviously I understand what death is and it\u2019s permanenance but I feel like I can\u2019t accept death because I have no idea what happens next. Last year I read \u201cUnder the Whispering Door\u201d by TJ Klune and I absolutely fell in love with it. It\u2019s a fantasy story about a ferryman that guides someone in the afterlife. He helps the main character accept his death and cross over in almost a whimsical way. No mention of religion, heaven, or hell. Just an adventure with room for reflection on our actions in life. I was hoping to find similar books to read!</p> <p>Thank you :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/SadbutRad0000\"> /u/SadbutRad0000 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1hhimyo/books_that_turn_death_into_an_adventure/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/commen",

Last year I had him read Red Rising by pierce brown, because I personally found them very addicting and fast paced, which I thought would be good for someone who hasn\u2019t read for fun since childhood. Well, he read red rising and Goldon Son, but, but DNFed Morning Star. He said he enjoyed the first two but somehow lost interest in the third book\ud83d\ude29</p> <p>Hes a big anime person, Hunter x Hunter and Attack on Titan being his favorites. Maybe im stubborn and simply want him to read a fantasy or sci fi book because its what i find myself enjoying most, but considering his love for different kinds of fantasy tv shows and anime I\u2019m fairly certain theres something out there he would enjoy. </p>",
