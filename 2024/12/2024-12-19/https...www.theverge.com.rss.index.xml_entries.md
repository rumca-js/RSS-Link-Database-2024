  <p id="4LtPYU">I’m guessing I’m not alone in getting more scam and spam calls than ever before. As a result, Google and the other Android phone makers have gradually added a range of built-in features to detect and deal with unwanted callers. These include having suspicious numbers flagged before you answer, being able to block nuisance callers, and even getting AI to answer incoming calls for you. Putting these protections in place should go a long way toward dealing with unwanted calls.</p>
