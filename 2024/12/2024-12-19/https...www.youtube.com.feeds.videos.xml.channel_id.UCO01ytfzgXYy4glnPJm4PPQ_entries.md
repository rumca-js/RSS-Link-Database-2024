Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Derek Chauvin's legal team is pushing for a new trial. I'll explain why, if he gets one, he'll likely be acquitted. An adult entertainment company prepares to pull out of Florida after their age verification law goes into effect. The industry would rather boycott a whole state than simply verify the ages of its users. What does that tell you? And San Francisco's new fat acceptance czar explains why it's fatphobic to ask for a smaller slice of cake.
