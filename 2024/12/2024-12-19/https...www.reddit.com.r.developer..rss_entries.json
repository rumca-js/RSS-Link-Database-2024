I coded as a hobby with Django and Python and created some basic webapps with React. But lately I&#39;ve been programming with Kotlin and Android Studio and I think I found something I really enjoy. So I am asking this question, despite the fact that I turned 50 this year and the job market being very tuff when looking for a developer role. Not to mention the insanity with AI and the fear of Developer jobs being replaced by AI. Is it even worth it for me to even try to become an Android Developer? Plus I also hear in order to publish an app in the Google Play Store, your required to find 10 testers in order to publish an app? Does anyone think I should give it a shot and not give up? On a positive note I live in the US, New York City and I do see jobs here but I don&#39;t know what employers are looking for or how competitive the market is? Would love to hear some insights, thanks.</p> </div><!",
