        "description": "Sam Fender's new album \"People Watching\" comes out in February and I'm reviewing its title track. I'm a big fan of Sam Fender and I was sorry to hear about the trouble he's having with one of his vocal cords. I have everything crossed for him. \nPortions of \"People Watching\" had to be cut for copyright reasons, so if you want to hear the whole track uninterrupted, follow: https://youtu.be/DHzaHMmXB6Y?si=mxUVyDWsGPqwgykG\n\n'Dreams on Toast' - the new Darkness album - is released in March - and we'll be going on tour:  \nhttps://www.thedarknesslive.com/tour-dates/\nhttps://thedarkness.lnk.to/dreamsontoast/officialstore \nOur single, The Longest Kiss is here:  https://thedarkness.lnk.to/tlk \n\nFor Cameo messages: https://www.cameo.com/justinhawkins\n\nTo go behind the scenes with me or to join a monthly Zoom Call Night, head over to my Patreon: http://www.patreon.com/jushawk\n\nJustin Hawkins Rides Again...The Podcast.
