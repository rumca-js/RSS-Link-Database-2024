Having recently moved to the UK from India, I&#39;ve had more than 50 interviews, managing to nearly succeed in 95% of them, yet the reasons for the rejections remain unclear. These setbacks have gradually impacted my confidence and nudged me toward my comfort zone. Therefore, I’m eager to participate in technical training to enhance my skills. Could anyone recommend some valuable training options? I want to feel that I’m learning rather than stagnating in my comfort zone.</p> <p>Regards,<br/> PS</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Routine-Pipe8923"> /u/Routine-Pipe8923 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1hhigrw/cyber_security_what_to_learn/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1hhigrw/cyber_

I’ve heard that some new grads can start right away if they’re from top cyber colleges like Georgia tech, but I just don’t know how realistic that is. Does a masters in CS, cyber, computer engineering, or another tech major affect one’s odds? If it is possible, what are other factors that play into it?
