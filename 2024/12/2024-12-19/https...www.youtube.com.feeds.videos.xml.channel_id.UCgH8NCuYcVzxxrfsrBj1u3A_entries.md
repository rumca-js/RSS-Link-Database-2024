Sam Fender's new album "People Watching" comes out in February and I'm reviewing its title track. I'm a big fan of Sam Fender and I was sorry to hear about the trouble he's having with one of his vocal cords. I have everything crossed for him. 
Portions of "People Watching" had to be cut for copyright reasons, so if you want to hear the whole track uninterrupted, follow: https://youtu.be/DHzaHMmXB6Y?si=mxUVyDWsGPqwgykG
