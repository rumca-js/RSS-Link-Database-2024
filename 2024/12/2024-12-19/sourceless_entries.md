Recent research shows that the South Pole of the moon experiences even more extreme temperature fluctuations and freezing conditions.

After its formation, the moon may have been the scene of such immense volcanic activity that its entire crust melted several times and was completely churned through. At that time, the moon orbited significantly closer to Earth than today. The resulting tidal forces heated up its interior and thus powered the violent volcanism. Only Jupiter's moon Io, by far the most volcanically active body in the solar system, offers comparable conditions.

Miniaturized spectroscopy systems that can detect trace concentrations at the parts-per-billion (ppb) level are of the utmost importance in applications ranging from environmental monitoring and industrial process control to biomedical diagnostics. However, the existing bench-top spectroscopy systems are too large, complex, and impractical for narrow-space use. Furthermore, the traditional laser spectroscopy techniques use bulky components like light sources, mirrors, detectors, and gas cells to detect light absorbed or scattered by a sample, which makes them unsuitable for scenarios calling for minimal invasiveness such as intravascular diagnosis.
