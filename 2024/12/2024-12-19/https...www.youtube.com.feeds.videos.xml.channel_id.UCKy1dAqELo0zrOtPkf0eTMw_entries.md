Sonic the Hedgehog 3, reviewed by A.A. Dowd. Narrated by Erik Adams.

They may have started on the wrong foot, but the Sonic the Hedgehog movies appear to be getting better as they go. Pushing further past the dopey buddy comedy of the original and the tiresome pop-culture references of its marginally better sequel, this third installment offers much more pleasing CGI, blessedly fewer human foibles, and a kind of tortured nega-Sonic in Shadow, a fan favorite antihero voiced by Keanu Reeves. The real draw, though, is Jim Carrey, coaxed out of supposed retirement to deliver a dual villain performance that doubles all the exaggerated comic pleasures of his ongoing turn as Dr. Robotnik.

James Gunn’s Superman may ostensibly be about introducing moviegoers to a new version of the Man of Steel, but it’s also an ensemble superhero movie. Case in point - the new trailer is crammed full of familiar faces from the DC Universe, both good and evil. This movie is set in a world where Superman and his fellow heroes have already been active for a few years, and it takes full advantage of that fact.

We see plenty of DC heroes and villains in this footage, including David Corenswet's Superman, Rachel Brosnahan's Lois Lane, Nicholas Hoult's Lex Luthor, Edi Gathegi's Mister Terrific, Isabela Merced's Hawkgirl, Nathan Fillion's Green Lantern Guy Gardner, and Anthony Carrigan's Metamorpho. And there are even some surprise inclusions like Krypto the Super-Dog and Kelex.

Don’t worry if you’re not familiar with every DC character in this early footage. We’re here to break down all the major players and what the trailer reveals about their respective roles in the first live-action DCU

In Grand Theft Hamlet, London-based couple Pinny Grylls, a documentary filmmaker, and Sam Crane, a veteran actor, begin an experiment in creativity they had no roadmap for. In early 2020, Crane was cast in the high-profile starring role in the London production of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child ... when the Covid-19 shutdowns brought the world to a standstill. 

After months of wondering when friends could get together again, life would get back to normal, and theatres could be attended, Crane was watching his and Grylls’ preteen son play the seminal videogame Grand Theft Auto. Soon, Crane contacted his friend and fellow thespian, Mark Oosterveen, and together they set up avatars within the game, eventually deciding to perform a Shakespeare play inside the virtual world of the popular Rockstar Games, Inc., title.

This film charts their ridiculous, hilarious and moving adventure as they battle violent griefers and discover surprising truths about life, friendship and the enduring
