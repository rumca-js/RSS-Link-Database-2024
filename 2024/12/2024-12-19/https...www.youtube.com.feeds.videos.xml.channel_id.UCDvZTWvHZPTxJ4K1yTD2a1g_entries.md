In this video series, we travel across the country to find some of the most insane Warhammer Backlogs we've ever seen. Warhammer 40k, Age of Sigmar, Mordheim, Kill Team and Necromunda just to mention a few! And hopefully, by the end of the video, we get to help them reduce their backlog just a little bit!
