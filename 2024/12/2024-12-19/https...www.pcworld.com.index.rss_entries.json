If you\u2019ve missed those shipping deadlines, you have one last resort \u2013 gift cards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, yes, we know, they\u2019re not as personal, but they\u2019re better than being empty-handed when your friend or family member tosses you a gift. And if we\u2019re being fair, sometimes, gift cards are better than actually spending money on something your loved ones may not like, may not need, or may already have. In this way, whomever it is you\u2019re shopping for has the chance to buy something they actually want.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From Amazon to Fortnite, from Best Buy to IKEA and Wendy\u2019s, here\u2019s a list of the best last-minute eGift cards we could find for you today.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"best-egift-cards-to-get-this-holiday\">Best eGift cards to get this holiday</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-lis",
