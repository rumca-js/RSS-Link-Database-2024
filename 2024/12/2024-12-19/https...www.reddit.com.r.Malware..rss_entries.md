<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I recently got hacked on both Instagram and Steam. On Instagram, the hackers posted random crypto scam content, and on Steam, they sold my entire inventory. I’m very cautious with my accounts and don’t share my passwords or usernames with anyone.</p> <p>I have two-factor authentication (2FA) enabled on both platforms: Instagram uses its own 2FA system, and I have Steam Guard activated for Steam. My Gmail account, which I use to manage these accounts, also has 2FA enabled.</p> <p>All my passwords are saved securely in my Google account, and I don’t believe it has been compromised. However, I suspect it’s possible I might have accidentally downloaded something malicious, which could have allowed the hackers to access my information. Alternatively, I’m concerned there might be some way my Gmail was compromised despite the 2FA.</p> <p>I’m trying to understand how this could have happened, as I’ve always taken security seriously.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m comparing av efficiency for my research in master thesis and I&#39;ve downloaded about 500 malware from malwarebazaar, windows defedner on my one PC sees them all as viruses right after plugging pendrive to computer. Fun begins when I do the same on PC with Avast - no reaction, no matter if I do scan (0 malware found), am I doing something wrong or Avast is that bad?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi Everyone, Over the last two months I have been worrying there is malware on my system, even though logically I know that it is very unlikely. I was so worried I completely reformatted my drive and reinstalled windows using the windows MCT about a month ago and have had no issues, but I still remain anxious when using my PC! I feel like I&#39;ve lost all my confidence in using computers, which isn&#39;t great because I will be going to university for computer science next year. I would appreciate some reassurance about the likelyhood of malware remaining after a clean reinstall of windows (I am aware of BIOS malware but less worried about it since it is rare and usually targets people of importance). Thanks for the help!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Plazyen"> /u/Plazyen </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Malware/comments/1hhgzsg/malware_anxiety/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span
