<p>The magician formerly known as Dynamo performs breathtaking feats to entertain charities, NHS workers and volunteers. Then gives them a present that borders on insulting</p><p>There are two kinds of people in this world – those who lean in to the magician’s world of tricks and illusion and those who immediately start to take it apart, explain how it must have been done and remind everyone that: “It’s not real!” The second group are among the worst people in the world. If you have any of them in your life, cut them out now. If they cannot understand the point of theatre, if they cannot see something amazing without wanting to dissect and destroy it, if they feel the need to point out that a woman cannot actually be sawn in half or a rabbit pulled from an ordinary top hat – well, they do not think much of you, my friend.</p><p>So, then, to Miracles – a Christmas special showcasing the skills of the magician <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/dec/23/dynamo-looks-b

<p>Like a song that changes time signature for the hell of it, like a friend that inexplicably blanks you, like a match report that noodles away for ages instead of just telling you what happened, Tottenham Hotspur remain medically incapable of doing things the simple way. This is becoming a kind of mania, a disorder, a cry for help. What is this? Who are you really? And, you know, can you not?</p><p>For all this, Ange Postecoglou’s side are Carabao Cup semi-finalists, the latest plot twist in a season in which nobody can really agree whether things are going well or not. Great football. But also some terrible football. But also, two games from a trophy. But also, 10th in the Premier League. But also two goals for the brilliant Dominic Solanke. But also two goals basically given away by Fraser Forster.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/dec/19/tottenham-manchester-united-carabao-cup-quarter-final-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

Sleepless nights. Panic attacks. Boris Johnson was so phobic that he frequently binned his invitations to show up. Not that it did much good. He was only delaying the inevitable.

<p>A widower sets out to understand his wife’s death in this tale of memory, trauma and German reunification, from the author of The Reader</p><p>Bernhard Schlink is best known for his 1995 novel The Reader, which has become a classic of Holocaust literature. It tells the story of a 15-year-old boy, living in postwar Germany, who falls into a passionate love affair with an older woman. Later he discovers that his former lover was a guard in a Nazi concentration camp.</p><p>Since then, Schlink has published two short story collections and a series of novels: some literary fiction and some crime. Like The Reader, most of these books explore the difficulties of trying to lay the past to rest. This new novel returns again to themes of memory, trauma and the impossibility of reconciliation. However, this time his subject is German reunification and the legacy of the German Democratic Republic.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/dec/19/the-granddaughter-by-bernhard-schlink

Mostly this was because the announcement itself was a foregone conclusion; with no other countries bidding to host the 2034 tournament, and the vote in favor of the 2030 hosts effectively dependent on simultaneous approval of the Saudis’ 2034 bid, there was little of the fanfare that usually accompanies Fifa’s biggest proclamations, and none of the shock that accompanied the revelation of past World Cup bid winners like Qatar.

After leaving Florham Park, he bounced between backup and bridge-starter roles in Carolina and San Francisco before winding up in Minnesota. Now he’s leading one of the hottest teams in the NFL. As injuries and attrition continue to knee-cap the Lions, the Vikings are making a late surge for the No 1 seed in the NFC – and potentially home-field advantage throughout the playoffs.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/dec/19/sam-darnold-minnesota-vikings-career-turnaround"

<p>A rich and vivid history of the Plantagenet cousins and rivals for the English throne</p><p>‘Richard II tried first being a Good King and then a Bad King without enjoying either very much. Then being told he was unbalanced, he got off the throne whereupon his cousin Lancaster (spelt Bolingbroke) quickly mounted the throne and said he was Henry IV, Part 1.” This, anyway, is how it goes in 1066 and All That, the classic parody of garbled schoolroom rote-learning. And while Helen Castor, a historian of&nbsp;great nuance and meticulous scholarship, would not put it quite so baldly, this remains pretty much the through-line of her luminous 600-page study of the Plantagenet cousins who between them generated the plots for three of Shakespeare’s history plays.</p><p>The Hart of Castor’s title is Richard II, who came to the throne at the age of 10 in 1377 and never stood a chance.

<p>A term’s worth of techno clubs and afterparties at university in Glasgow didn’t do much for my education or my choice of Christmas gifts</p><p>When I left the north of Ireland for the University of Glasgow 20&nbsp;years&nbsp;ago, I threw myself into the city’s hard‑partying lifestyle with all the vigour you would expect of a Presbyterian pastor’s daughter raised amid the weirdness of 1990s Belfast. My first term was a whirl of&nbsp;dancing to techno music in railway arches and warehouses, making new friends at 10am at afterparties in the kitchens of tenement flats. I slept on strangers’ carpets, wrapped in my massive leopard-print faux-fur coat from a&nbsp;vintage store called Starry Starry Night. I&nbsp;wore a fluffy hat that doubled up as a pillow. I&nbsp;barely ate anything solid and rarely saw daylight – not that Glaswegian daylight is anything to write home&nbsp;about.</p><p>After a particularly wild week of parties turning into afterparties turning into pub daytime sessions

<p>Dr Chris van Tulleken has been at the forefront of the campaign to change our food system and better regulate the sale of ultra-processed foods (UPF). This year he will be giving the Royal Institution Christmas lectures, Britain’s most prestigious public science lectures, in which he’ll be investigating how food has fundamentally shaped human evolution, the importance of our microbiome – as the extra ‘organ’ we didn’t know we had – and how we can all eat better in future, for the sake of our own health and the health of the planet.</p><p>Nicola Davis sat down with Van Tulleken to discuss the lectures, the challenge of understanding the impact of UPFs on our health, and his top tip for Christmas dinner.

<p>Port Talbot in Wales is defined by its huge steelworks. But in January Tata Steel announced it was ending primary steelmaking there. <strong>George McDonagh</strong> charts a year that could change the town for ever</p><p>In January, Tata Steel announced it was ending primary steelmaking in Port Talbot. The town is known for two huge blast furnaces and its massive steelworks that has provided employment for decades. George McDonagh travelled there to see how people were reacting. He met Gareth Edwards, who had spent 30 years working there and was worried about the thousands of jobs that could be lost.</p><p>Tata said it was losing £1m a day at the site and that a change to greener electric arc furnaces, which change scrap metal into new steel, was needed. But in Port Talbot there was fear that this would mean they were destined to follow the fate of other steel towns that have slumped into decline once the furnaces closed.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2024/d
