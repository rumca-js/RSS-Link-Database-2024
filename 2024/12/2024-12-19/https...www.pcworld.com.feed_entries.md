<p>Many gaming laptops are entirely too expensive, but this particular Acer Nitro V 15 configuration isn’t just well-priced — it’s pretty darn powerful! <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/acer-acer-nitro-15-6-fhd-ips-144hz-gaming-laptop-13th-gen-intel-core-i7-nvidia-geforce-rtx-4060-16gb-ddr5-512gb-ssd-obsidian-black/6576934.p?skuId=6576934">It’s now available for $800 at Best Buy</a>, so you’ll end up saving $300.</p>



<p>With an Intel Core i7-13620H processor and 16GB of DDR5 RAM, this laptop will breeze through any task you throw its way and multitask numerous apps and browser tabs with ease. The 512GB SSD should also be plenty of space for all the software and files you need to keep on board, including photos, videos, and games.</p>



<p>But the pièce de résistance of this laptop is the GeForce RTX 4060 GPU, which might not be the newest or greatest

<p>I’ve been enjoying the lightning-fast speeds of SSDs (solid state drives) to store and restore data for a while now. For gaming they provide quick loading times, support the latest graphics, and as a bonus they produce less heat than the old-school mechanical drives I used to use.</p>



<p>But having lost the data on an old HDD (hard disk drive) when it up and failed on me, I’m now wondering about my SSDs’ lifespans. My desktop gaming rig houses a pair that are about eight years old. So, should I be worried?</p>

<p>If YouTube TV’s forthcoming price hike feels like a breaking point to you, you’re not alone.</p>



<p>Over the last week, I’ve heard from a bunch of folks who say the rate hike—from $73 per month to $83 per month, starting January 13, 2025—is the last straw. They’re now seeking alternatives to YouTube TV that will provide comparable channel coverage for less.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, that sort of easy escape hatch doesn’t exist. Like every other live TV service (<a href="https://www.techhive.com/article/1419277/think-streaming-price-hikes-are-bad-cables-are-even-worse.html">including satellite and cable</a>), YouTube TV keeps raising prices because TV programmers keep demanding more money for their channels. Unless the entire industry embraces <a href="https://www.techhive.com/article/2484386/cable-tv-hits-a-fork-in-the-road.html">cheaper, more flexible b
