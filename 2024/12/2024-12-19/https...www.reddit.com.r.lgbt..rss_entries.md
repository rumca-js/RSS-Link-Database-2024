<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve seen lots of posts from people decrying the idea of &quot;privileged&quot; white transgender Americans fleeing America because of the election to claim asylum in another country. I hate people who say this, or suggest that American trans people are not qualified or will always be denied asylum based soley on where theyre from. Applying for asylum is a HUMAN RIGHT. That, and it&#39;s incredibly priveledged to suggest someone can immigrate abroad or simply &quot;move to California&quot; or something like that.</p> <p>Transgender people are less educated, poorer, and obviously far more likely to be discriminated against in employment, housing and pretty much any other relevant economic statistic. We&#39;re a fucking hated minority at best. Me personally, I&#39;m on SNAP (food stamps) because I&#39;m a student on a work-study and can&#39;t afford to feed myself.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>If you really think about it someone is screaming &quot;seek counseling, seek therapy&quot; is basically giving you the green light to seek out a gender therapist to work through whatever it is your kicking around inside your head.
