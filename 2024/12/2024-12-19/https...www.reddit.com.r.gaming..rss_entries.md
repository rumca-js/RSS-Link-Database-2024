## Anyone use a recumbent stationary bike while gaming?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I had a recumbent bike years ago that had a heart rate monitor attached to it. I would set the bike to keep my heart rate at 135 bpm. It did a really good job and I could ride it for an hour while playing games. I lost that bike somehow and tried it with another bike but that new bike wasn&#39;t good at keeping the heart rate at a set level, it would overcompensate when you got too low or too high. Anyone else do this ever?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ScrewWorkn"> /u/ScrewWorkn </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1hhjam8/anyone_use_a_recumbent_stationary_bike_while/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1hhjam8/anyone_use_a_recumbent_stationary_bike_while/">[comments]</a></span>
