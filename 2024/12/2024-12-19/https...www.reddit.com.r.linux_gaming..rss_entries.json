I enabled Wayland as from what I can tell it is definitively required, but the rest is unclear:</p> <p>If I use gamescope, does that suffice to get HDR? Do recent versions of Proton take care of it for applicable games? The combo of Proton+Gamescope? Do I absolutely need to switch to Plasma 6 right now, and if so does Gamescope become unnecessary?</p> <p>Part of me is under the impression that I should just wait for Cosmic to eventually support it, then upgrade, but it seems this feature slipped from the first release next year. I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s info on when it is expected to be available.</p> <p>Also my monitor supports G-sync, and I\u2019m insure of a few things there- does HDR change any of the guidan",

Yet, with latest everything (ge-proton9-21, dxvk-2.5.1, vkd3d-proton-2.14, dxvk-nvapi-v0.8.0) Cyberpunk 2077 still greys out the FG option. When added to Steam as a non-Steam game and forced through Proton, it works just fine.</p> <p>Is Bottles lagging behind Steam in this regard? Or am I missing an option somewhere?

I&#39;m currently using the latest proton-GE (from heroic).</p> <p>Does anyone have a clue what could be causing the game to not properly apply the chosen resolution and run so poorly?
