<p>Tragedy and addiction vie for your attention in this jaw-dropping memoir by the late Lisa Marie Presley, completed by her daughter from taped interviews</p><p>What to expect from Lisa Marie Presley’s memoir? Some sanitised, cagey reminiscences, dutifully studded with anecdotes about her father, Elvis, the king of rock’n’roll, who died aged 42 in 1977? Instead, it’s a warts and all jaw-dropper. The marriages (including Michael Jackson and Nicolas Cage). The drugs (Lisa Marie spiralled into opioid addiction after a caesarean section to deliver her twins). And that’s before the revelations about her son Ben Keough’s 2020 suicide (she kept his body on dry ice in her California home for two months). When her actor daughter,<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/aug/20/riley-keough-interview-logan-lucky"> Riley Keough</a> (from <em>Daisy Jones &amp; </em><em>the Six</em>), writes that she wants Lisa Marie to emerge from the pages of the memoir as a “three-dimensional character”,

My advice is mostly the usual stuff: support the head, pat their bums; never refuse an offer of help or a chance to sleep; and don’t worry about nappy changes because any phobia of foul smells and runny fluids will quickly be replaced with a fear of everything on earth that can damage the fragile little person you’re in charge of.</p><p>Increasingly, however, I have to talk about money, too, because the single most abiding pressure of parenting – for those lucky enough to have healthy, happy children at least – is the fact that it is, basically, financially ruinous.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/oct/13/the-thing-about-parenting-is-that-it-is-basically-financially-ruinous">Continue reading...</a>

I touch her arm lightly in attempted reassurance and then try to turn ­discreetly to the gleaming pine track where the GB men’s team pursuit squad race past at blurring speed.</p><p>The soft hiss of their bikes makes an eerie sound at the Manchester Velodrome as they prepare for the track world championships, which begin in Ballerup, Denmark on Wednesday.

Even being on the track will be an incredible achievement.</p> <a href=

<p>Toy Story 4 director Josh Cooley brings a blast of energy, sharp wit and an all-star voice cast to this refreshingly different origin tale</p><p>Few franchises can match the <em>Transformers</em> movies for thunderous stupidity. It’s a series that tends to take a giant metal fist (with added bazooka attachments) to storytelling niceties such as plot coherence and character nuance. It delivers a frequently overwhelming and nonsensical viewing experience that feels like trying to cross the road during a monster truck rally. It’s loud, brash and aggressive. And that’s fine, I guess. Sometimes all you need from a movie is a bunch of self-aggrandising metal monsters bashing the rivets off each other.</p><p>With its tradition of dyed-in-the-wool dumb-assery and its loyal and defensive fans (the only time I ever received a death threat from a reader was after a one-star pan of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/jul/29/stevenspielberg.actionandadventure">Michael Bay’s 2007 pict

<p>Looking at possible secondary schools as a parent is a real time machine</p><p>There is something uncanny and magical about a school at night, the windows blazing as you approach in the rain through a patent-leather car park. I’ve been visiting secondary schools with my daughter and every time I walk through the doors of another sprawling maze of linoleum and cubist self-portraits I lose my breath a little. It’s not just the act of entering these buildings, with their smells of piss and pasta and their rickety architecture of adolescence, though it is this a bit. It is this a bit because for all the million-pound immersive experiences where you step inside, I don’t know, the mind of Beethoven or whatever and drink wine from a shoe, there is no faster way to take an adult back in time than by leading them into a suburban school at 6pm on a Thursday.</p><p>There we are again, 14, greasy and livid, trying to make decisions about the life we want to lead by picking either French or bio

Ahead of her extraordinary performance in the latest Pedro Almodóvar film, she opens up about love, death and the complexity and richness of ordinary lives</p><p>Yesterday Julianne Moore was on the subway in New York, listening discreetly to strangers. “I was sitting there and I heard one woman say, ‘Well, I know that’s exactly what you’d do, I know that’s what you’re like.’ And the other woman said, ‘It’s true, I just don’t like confrontation, I don’t!’” Perhaps it’s distracting, the idea that Moore, not only an Oscar-winning actor, but one whose airy beauty and long red hair (red hair that an early director warned would limit her career, ha) makes her one of the most recognisable people in the world, could pass unnoticed through a carriage of chattering commuters. But please remember – or trust me – that part of Moore’s talent is the ability to transform, to step back from herself. She is a 63-year-old charac

<p> The Road to Somewhere author argues that the liberating impact of feminism has harmed our children in a book shot through with claims that don’t stand up to scrutiny</p><p>It was mostly in the small hours that I first read David Goodhart’s new book on caring. By coincidence, it arrived as I was trying to look after my dying father at one end of the country and my own family at the other, while simultaneously attempting to work.

When it came to his own four children and elderly parents, he confesses, like many men of his generation he “played a subordinate role” to his now ex-wife and his sisters respectively. As a man tackling this topic now, he writes, he’s braced for some flak. Well, yes; and perhaps particularly as the kind of man who writes that while the early days of lockdown might have been tough

<p>We are losing in the fight against global warming, it is time to put effort into controlling what we pump into the atmosphere</p><p>The havoc unleashed by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/12/florida-hurricane-milton-helene">Hurricane Milton</a> provided unambiguous evidence that we are entering a critical and alarming new phase in the planet’s climate crisis. Rising fossil fuel emissions have triggered increases in ocean temperatures and sea levels to such an extent they are generating some of the most destructive storms ever experienced in Florida. Together with Hurricane Helene earlier, the lives of about 250 people have been claimed and thousands of homes destroyed. Florida has been left reeling and forecasters have warned there is more to come – a lot more.</p><p>It is a grim prognosis that should be galvanising Florida’s political leaders into taking urgent action to protect the state. Extraordinarily, this has not been the case. Despite the intensificatio

<p>Readers respond to Howard Jacobson’s article about the media coverage of violence in the Middle East</p><p>“Tales of infanticide” is not what is happening in Gaza (“<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/06/tales-of-infanticide-have-stoked-hatred-of-jews-for-centuries-they-echo-still-today">Tales of infanticide have stoked hatred of Jews for centuries. They echo still today</a>”). These are real deaths and real children and real loss. The blood libel myth is a horrific example of how antisemitic propaganda was used to persecute, and eventually exile, the Jewish population of England. It is a shameful facet of British history but it is, and it is important that we strip its power by firmly establishing this, a myth. The killing and bombing and starving of Gaza children is not a myth. It is fact, it is continuing and it is irrevocably disrespectful to their memory and their families to suggest that their bodies are only a prop in an antisemitic narrative.</p><p>W

<p>As Major League Baseball’s final four take aim at the World Series starting on Sunday, playoff TV ratings are soaring thanks to big stars, memorable plays and unbridled fun</p><p>We’re just about halfway toward determining who will become baseball’s World Series champions, which means there are just four teams remaining. The best-of-seven American League Championship Series between the Cleveland Guardians and the New York Yankees begins on Monday in the Bronx, while the New York Mets will be in Los Angeles to face the Dodgers on Sunday in Game 1 of the National League Championship Series.</p><p>How did we get here? Simply put, with some of the more captivating early-round playoff baseball we’ve seen in some time. And the drama has been much welcome after last year’s early rounds included no fewer than six series sweeps, with series winners trouncing losers by 20 games to two, leaving all but the most hardcore baseball fans pining for preseason NBA games.</p> <a href="https://www.th

They know what they’re doing right now is good, but hope that at some point in the future they will do it better. They are forever striving towards a goal which is just out of reach. The risk is that, with their eyes on that future, they fail to clock what they have in the present. The coolly talented young team at Stage in Exeter are clearly ambitious, but I very much hope they are able to live as deeply in the present tense as possible. It would be a crying shame if, when they move on to the bigger and greater things that doubtless await them, they only realise in retrospect the brilliance of what they had going on now; here in this tiny 20-seater restau
