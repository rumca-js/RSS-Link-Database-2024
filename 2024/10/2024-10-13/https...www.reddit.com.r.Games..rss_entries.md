<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m torn about it, maybe it depends on how well the game does it.</p> <p>I&#39;ve sometimes liked it when a game just throws you straight into the action which sets a great first impression right at the beginning. I remember Hades just starts you straight away with a run without explaining who you are or what you&#39;re doing or anything, until you die.</p> <p>Then other games do it with an unskippable cutscene right at the beginning, I think those are the worst because you can&#39;t until it finishes!</p> <p>Most recently I was playing Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero and that starts the game with a tutorial of Goku vs Vegeta. That started the game with a weird impression as the tutorial is very barebones and Vegeta&#39;s just kinda standing there doing nothing, which Dunkey made fun of as well.</p> <p>What do people think?
