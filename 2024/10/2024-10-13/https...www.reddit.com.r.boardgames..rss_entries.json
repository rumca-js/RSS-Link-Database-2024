Basically, it was a trivia game where a card was drawn. On the card, it showed five things in five different colors as well as a rule like &quot;list from most to least.&quot; For example, say the card said &quot;rank these countries from most to least populated&quot; and it had 5 countries each with a specific color (blue = USA, green= China). Then, everyone would have 5 different color tiles and a game piece where the tiles had to be placed in. They&#39;d have to place the tiles in the game board and would get points for each one they had right. As for physical appearance, I remember the box being red. The closest I have found, would be a Hasbro game called <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Trivia-Electronic-Players-Trivial-Pursuit/dp/B0CS7DRQXJ?th=1\">Drop Trivia</a>. It only has the &#39;ranking in sequential order&#39; mechanic tho.
