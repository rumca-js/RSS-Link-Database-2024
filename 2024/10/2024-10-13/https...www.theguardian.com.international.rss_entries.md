<p>New manager stresses the importance of players enjoying representing their country more than he did himself</p><p>It is Sunday afternoon in the Cowbridge Suite of the Vale Resort on the outskirts of Cardiff, base camp for Wales, and the pre-Montenegro press conference is 23 minutes old when the last question, about playing long, is put to Craig Bellamy. Most managers would be minded to wrap things up. Then again, Bellamy is not a most-managers kind of character. “I like to give you a fair fight,” he says, his words lingering for a second or two. And he is only getting started, a five-minute soliloquy providing an absorbing insight into his deep and complex psyche.</p><p>“I don’t want people coming off feeling like I did, and that’s the honest truth,” says the 45-year-old. “I want you to love this [playing for Wales], I want you to come away thinking: ‘I can’t wait to play again. It might not have been our day but I felt like I had a chance of scoring, I had so much of the ball.’ So

If in the circumstances it was predictable that Pakistan might choose to shake up their team, the decision to drop their most famous and experienced player, the former captain Babar Azam, as well as their two premier seamers, Shaheen Shah Afridi and Naseem Shah, for both remaining matches against England comes as a profound shock. Sarfaraz Ahmed, another former captain, who did not play in the first game, has also been released.</p><p>Since England won the first Test by an innings and 47 runs on Friday afternoon, the Pakistan Cricket Board has rebooted its selection panel and the team.

<p>The film-maker, playwright and novelist finished his last book, Yorùbá Boy Running, the day before he died in 2022. Now, loved ones and collaborators, including his daughter Temi and longtime friend Kwame Kwei-Armah, celebrate the passionate man behind the work</p><p>In early August 2022, Biyi Bándélé had a conversation with his editor, Hannah Chukwu, about the novel he was working on, <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/yoruba-boy-running-9780241562697/">Yorùbá Boy Running</a>, after which he sent her a revised version of the manuscript. On the following day, the 54-year-old film-maker, playwright and novelist took his own life, leaving behind an impressive and strikingly varied body of work: the film adaptation of Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/apr/25/nigerian-censors-halt-civil-war-film">Half of a Yellow Sun</a>, which took seven years to make; stage versions of Chinua Achebe’s Things Fall Apart, Aphra Behn’s Oroonoko and Lorca’s Yerm

## ‘It’s quite a thing to do a show here and openly use the word looting’: artist Hew Locke on decolonising the British Museum

<p>After his triumphant Tate installation, The Procession, the artist is preparing a radical exhibition tackling Britain’s imperial past. He talks about why we must return plundered artefacts and rethink attitudes to heritage</p><p>Within the oak-panelled walls and glass display cases of the Enlightenment Gallery of the British Museum – a long, impossibly high-ceilinged room that is a temple to the gods of reason and imperialism – there is a little unmarked secret door, leading backstage or who knows where. You would never spot it unless you were looking. But for the rest of the autumn – for the first time in its 200-year history – that door will be symbolically flung open and three raucous figures will be emerging from it, invading the hushed space of marble busts and dinosaur fossils and leather-bound books. Leading the charge will be a young child of indeterminate heritage, in rags and patches, calling the others on.</p><p>The figures emerge not only from the secret door but from t

<p>The New York Liberty’s chaotic, enigmatic, queer-coded mascot is a provocative pachyderm who has served her way to It-Girl status amid her team’s chase of a first WNBA title</p><p>When the New York Liberty made their pre-game entrance beneath the Barclays Center ahead of the opening game of their WNBA semi-final series against the Las Vegas Aces last month, there was more spirit and swagger on display than at any New York Fashion Week event. Star point guard Sabrina Ionescu was giving quiet luxury in a sage turtleneck and camel-colored blazer. Breanna Stewart, the two-time WNBA Most Valuable Player, called to mind Charli xcx with her black sunglasses and bodacious mane spilling out of a New York or Nowhere baseball hat. But none of them commanded the makeshift catwalk quite like the 5ft 10in long-lashed elephant rocking a zebra-print coat, serving and vamping for her adoring fans with saucy hip-pops and jaunty swings of an umbrella dangling from her wrist.</p><p>There are mascots a

<p>Freedom from the temptations pushed at us on a daily basis is now a class issue</p><p>They are problems of success, really, these modern ills. Social media addiction, gaming disorders, the compulsive over-eating of sugar and processed gloop: they are products of a society with more than enough food, leisure time and boredom, and without the life-or-death excitement that kept our ancestors busy.</p><p>We could perhaps think of our rising addiction problems as something like a peacock’s tail or companionable parasite – the costly signal that we no longer need to strain every nerve&nbsp;to stay alive. Only a species that is this superfluously good at survival&nbsp;could afford to hack its own anti-survival neural circuitry, targeting the pathways that instead&nbsp;make it more likely to die. Problems of success are harder, not easier, to deal with, of course – you wouldn’t want to reverse the conditions that got us here. Releasing wolves back among us is not the right policy for tackl

<p>Journalist Javier Cáceres asked many of the game’s biggest names – from Guardiola to Pelé and Bobby Charlton – to draw their favourite goals: the results are revealing</p><p>Like the best stories, the biggest adventures and football itself, this begins in a pub. In 2005 the journalist Javier Cáceres flew from Berlin to Santiago to interview Leonel Sánchez in a bar called Munich where the former international had his own stein with his name on. Sánchez, the son of a boxer, joint-top scorer at the 1962 World Cup, was one of Chile’s greatest players and among the hardest too. Once leader of the team they named the Blue Ballet, what he did that day over a beer would, two decades on and purely by chance, bring together footballers from around the world in a unique collection of art.</p><p>In the Battle of Santiago, between Chile and Italy – memorably introduced by David Coleman as “the most stupid, appalling, disgusting and disgraceful exhibition of football, possibly in the history of

I talk to her.’</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/oct/13/i-was-utterly-ripe-to-be-devoted-the-fraught-business-of-modern-mothering-2000">Continue reading...</a>
