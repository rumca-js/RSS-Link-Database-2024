[WARNING - I'm on my laptop at Vince's house, so there may be Dechnical Tifficulties] I'm on the road, and I've been working on stuff (and eating snacks) here at VinceyCon! I'm here with the man himself @VinceVenturella and also @SamLenzArtwork @Ninjon @Miniac and @metalaf1136 (aka Ben Kantor). Some of them might even poke their heads into the stream as some point. We'll see how that goes, and of course - I'll answer your wargaming-related questions. Come have fun!
