I decided to put GameStop's new retro game initiative to the test by buying a bunch of old consoles and games. What I got was a wild ride of broken discs, dirty consoles, and even some mystery items that weren't what I ordered at all. Despite some bright spots, GameStop's Retro left a lot to be desired.
