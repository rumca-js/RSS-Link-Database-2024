I&#39;ve recently bought myself a very good gaming pc and was hoping for some suggestions on what to play. </p> <p>I&#39;d be interested in hearing what you believe are either pc exclusive games that I&#39;ve been missing out on or games that are just objectively better on pc.</p> <p>I&#39;m into most kinds of games. Only real exceptions are sports and visual novels .</p> <p>Thanks in advance for any suggestions!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/sockets1984"> /u/sockets1984 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1g2oy29/new_to_pc_gaming/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1g2oy29/new_to_pc_gaming/">[comments]</a></span>
