## I just found out someone from my church threw out Chicken vs. Hotdog from our Youth room because they thought the hot dog looked like a dick.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I volunteer as one of the leaders for our church&#39;s high schoolers group and a few months ago the Youth Pastor asked me for game suggestions for the teens as I had been buying a few games with my own money and bringing them in. I gave him a list of short games with easy rule sets that could be learned and played before/after the teaching and last week he picked up Chicken Vs. Hotdog. Played it that Sunday with a few of the kids and we had a good time.</p> <p>I just received a text that apparently an older person had walked into the Youth Room, saw the game being played, thought the hot dog looked like a dick, and threw it away. I&#39;m honestly annoyed they didn&#39;t just ask me if I wanted the game first but it is pretty funny and hope it gives someone a chuckle.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/DocGerbil256"> /u/DocGerbil256 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/commen

My example is Clank! Catacombs. I have been waiting for this to become available again in my part of the world (which is New Zealand, finding board games here is challenging at the best of times) but I have been unable to find it anywhere.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Og nemesis vs lockdown for backstabbing </p> <p>I am really interested in nemesis games, and both of them seems nice , I am currently leaning towards lockdown because on paper traitor mechanics seems to be better in it .in og it feels like if someone goes for engines and don&#39;t care about ship course they instantly are sus , same for ship course without interest in engines. it feels like in lockdown it&#39;s way harder to be sure who is going to betray , also light mechanic adds some extra ways to backstabbing, I would like ship theme way more compared to space Base but it isn&#39;t big deal for me. My mine deciding factor will probably be which game has more interesting traitor /backstabbing mechanics, more interesting ways to betray others , in which game it&#39;s harder to sus out player who has bad intentions?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/putatoe"> /u/putatoe </a> <br/> <span><a href="ht

They&#39;re not super visible when looking at the boards normally because of the artwork, but you can feel them - it feels like some gunk that could be scraped off (but I don&#39;t wanna try that and destroy the artwork). I held them up to the sunlight and it&#39;s really visible there as you can see in the photos (last photo is one of the two unaffected boards). Is this excess glue from the process of putting together dual layered playerboards? Or worse, is it mould? Debating whether I should be askin

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I used to be obsessed with this game in high school (2016-2019). Basically, it was a trivia game where a card was drawn. On the card, it showed five things in five different colors as well as a rule like &quot;list from most to least.&quot; For example, say the card said &quot;rank these countries from most to least populated&quot; and it had 5 countries each with a specific color (blue = USA, green= China). Then, everyone would have 5 different color tiles and a game piece where the tiles had to be placed in. They&#39;d have to place the tiles in the game board and would get points for each one they had right. As for physical appearance, I remember the box being red. The closest I have found, would be a Hasbro game called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Trivia-Electronic-Players-Trivial-Pursuit/dp/B0CS7DRQXJ?th=1">Drop Trivia</a>. It only has the &#39;ranking in sequential order&#39; mechanic tho. Any help is appreciated thank you. </p> </div><!-- SC

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So the basis of the game is that you have a deck of cards and try to get to the closest to either of the two with similar to blackjack card rules: red 3 (a 3 of diamonds and a black king would be best for this) or if your trying for black 13 (black king and a three of spades would be best for this), if you get the closest to either two you win half of the pot, if your the closest to both it’s referred to as a “wheel”. You can go over or under 3 and as long as your the closest to the two goals you win. If you have cards adding up to 14 black vs someone with 12 black the lower wins. apologies if this is a bit wordy, played this game with a few colleagues awhile ago and wanted to find the name if there is one.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/TonierZeabra"> /u/TonierZeabra </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1g2jx0q/trying_to_find_the_name_of_red_3_black_13_card/">[l

My cousins and I are trying to find this game we once played at a game parlor in a different city, but failed to take a picture of. The game consisted of guessing words that were laid out in a scramble based on the clues that were given. The front of the card which was shown to the players had the scramble and the back had two columns with clues. You chose to read down either Column A or B, but all the words were on the front side so the players had multiple to choose from. When you guessed a word correctly from the column you would win a token. I think there were 5 tokens per round, one for each clue. At the end of the round whoever ha

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I live in Switzerland, in the French speaking part. I play in English or French and when I look at games, I often see stores selling it in German for a really low price. Happened with <strong>Gaia Project</strong> for instance, as it&#39;s language independent I bought it in German because it was half the price (40 euros vs 80). It also seems to be the case with <strong>A Feast for Odin</strong>, around 50 euros in German, 90-100 euros in English of French (I&#39;ve checked the prices in France to be sure it&#39;s not just a Swiss thing and there also, the prices were around that).</p> <p>These games are both from the same German Designer so maybe that&#39;s it, but I&#39;ve checked things like <strong>Marvel Champions</strong>, the base game is also cheaper (around 10 to 15 euros it seems), <strong>Mage Knight ultimate</strong> (here it&#39;s 20 to 30 euros cheaper in German) . <strong>Terra Nova</strong> also seems to often be 10 to 15 euros less.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Sorcery: Contested Realm is a TCG played on a grid that combines elements of resource management, territory control, and tactical combat. </p> <p>Imagine playing MTG on a board, where players control Avatars casting spells and creatures. The resource system differs from mtg as it’s drawn from a separate pile called sites - negating the issue of inability to cast spells due to bad draw. </p> <p>Some players have also described Sorcery to playing Chess. Even if you were to net deck, it is important to approach each matchup from a positioning and movement standpoint. Skill gap becomes apparent between 2 players using the same deck due to tactical decisions made in addition to overarching strategy.</p> <p>So far an expansion Arthurian Legends has been released, in addition to the base set, recently debuting at Essen, and has won over fans with its thematic depiction of the lore. One appeal of Sorcery is the hand drawn /painted art of each cards, something
