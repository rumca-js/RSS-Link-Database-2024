<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve saw a video recently which leaked my interest about RSS, but I do not know where to start. Having my own RSS aggregator server is out of the question. I need some solution where I could read my news on my phone (android) and PC (gnome), and maybe on the web. What app/service will I need? Thank you in advance</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ChanceGuarantee3588"> /u/ChanceGuarantee3588 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1g2xe8o/new_to_rss/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1g2xe8o/new_to_rss/">[comments]</a></span>
