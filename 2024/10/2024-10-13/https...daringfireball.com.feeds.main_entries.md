<p>Jamie Zawinski:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For those of you who are unaware of these finer details, 0.9 was
the first release of the Netscape browser (which begat Firefox)
available to the general public. This beta release was an
unannounced surprise. Prior to this, everyone assumed that what we
were doing was going to be a standard for-sale product where you
sent off your $35 and then some time later got a disc in the mail
with a license key. That we just said, “Here’s our FTP site, come
get it, go crazy” was, at the time, <em>shocking</em> to people.</p>
