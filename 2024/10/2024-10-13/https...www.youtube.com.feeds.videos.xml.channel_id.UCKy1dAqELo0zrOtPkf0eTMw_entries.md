One of the best features of Dragon Ball Sparking ZERO is the ability to rewrite Dragon Ball history and experience new and unique ways classic moments from the story could play out. These branching paths require you to complete specific tasks during fights, such as beating down an opponent quickly or defeating an opponent that a character canonically lost to. One particular branch path has stumped the community involving two members of the Ginyu Force. IGN has cracked the code, however, and will show you how to unlock the Jeice and Burter Branch Path in Dragonball Sparking Zero.
