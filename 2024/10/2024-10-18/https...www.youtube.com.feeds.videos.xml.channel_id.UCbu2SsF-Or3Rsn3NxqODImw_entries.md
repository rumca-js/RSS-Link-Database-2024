Mars Attracts is a theme park management sim set in the iconic Mars Attacks™ universe. 

Build rides, hire and train staff, manage guest needs, and most importantly - abduct humans to serve as the star attractions! Craft the perfect park to appeal to your Martian guests, but don’t forget to keep your humans’ needs met too - the hideous enclosed-brained Earthlings can be prone to escape!

Mars Attracts will be released in Early Access on Steam in 2025, and is now accepting applications for the first Alpha Playtest in November 2024.
