## Show HN: What happens if you make a crossword out of Reddit r/gaming

<p>As a fan of dense New York Times-style crosswords, I challenged myself to create topic-specific puzzles. It turns out that generating crosswords and efficiently placing words is a non-trivial computational problem.<p>I started the project, "Joystick Jargon" combining traditional crossword elements with gaming-related vocabulary. Here's the technical process behind it:<p>1. Data Source: Used a 3.8 Million Rows Reddit dataset from Hugging Face (https://huggingface.co/datasets/webis/tldr-17).<p>2. Data Filtering: Narrowed down to gaming-related subreddits (r/gaming, r/dota2, r/leagueoflegends).<p>3. Keyword Extraction: Employed ML techniques, specifically BERT-embeddings and cosine similarity, to extract keywords from the subreddits.<p>4. Data Preprocessing: Cleaned up data unsuitable for crossword puzzles.<p>5. Grid Generation: Implemented a heuristic crossword algorithm to create grids and place words efficiently.<p>6. Clue Generation: Utilized a Large Language Model to generate co

<p>Hey all! I always wanted to arrange my  text/markdown/pdf files on a 2D canvas and visualize them without opening all the windows. An extra feature I added is also visualizing folders within - so kind of a 3D visualization? It was also important to be an offline desktop app, rather than online tool like Miro or Mural, because once I edit files in Sublime or AdobePDF then I want changes to sync in the canvas right away.<p>Some technical points and lessons learned: being Android developer helped a lot with this project since I used Kotlin Multiplatform with Compose Desktop renderer (actually skiko). It runs on JVM under the hood, which was exciting at first since I can use the app on all of my Mac/Windows/Linux machines. Right? Wrong. One lesson I learned wasn’t “write once - run everywhere”, it was “write once - test everywhere; repeat”. On the other hand, using Kotlin Multiplatform will allow me easily to port to Android and port the logic to iOS.<p>Anyways, I released LimanDoc v1

The experiment did not work, but the feedback we received certainly did.<p>You helped us realize there was something there and gave us a confidence boost: 
"This is freaking amazing. Just freaking brilliant."<p>You told us what to invest on:
"Any chance of Beefree being embeddable, either as a service or open source?"<p>You pointed out the areas we needed to improve:
