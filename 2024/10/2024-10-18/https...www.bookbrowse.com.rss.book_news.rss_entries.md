 The University of Cincinnati announced on Thursday that the University of Cincinnati Press will shut down on June 25. In a release, the university said that it had "determined that the long-term financial sustainment of the University of Cincinnati Press is not feasible. Funding resources, including start-up funds, have been exhausted and the press is not in a self-sustaining financial position."
