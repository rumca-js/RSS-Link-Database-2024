## I’m very proud of this design. Not for the design itself, I know it’s rudimentary, but because I designed it in fusion, and kept hitting snags, but ended up figuring it out. I just started using fusion a week ago, and I’m just getting back into 3D printing after 10 years. I’m having a lot of fun!
