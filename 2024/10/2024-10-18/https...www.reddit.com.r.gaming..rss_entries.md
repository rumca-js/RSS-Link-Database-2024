<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I first played Oregon Trail waaay back in the olden days of the late 1980s and the game made a real impression on me. I&#39;ve been thinking about it again lately and wondering if there&#39;s been any attempt to do a modern remake of the game, or even just something in a similar vein? I&#39;m looking for something more akin to the full RPG experience rather than the RNG-heavy simulation of the original, but I love the management aspects, the planning, decision-making, etc, I just want something more than &#39;little pixelated wagon moves across the screen&#39;. Does anything like this exist? Obviously it doesn&#39;t have to be Oregon Trail, a modern-ish RPG in a similar vein would scratch that itch too.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/libra00"> /u/libra00 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1g6mgnd/modern_fully_fleshedout_oregon_traillike_rpg/">[link]</a></span> &
