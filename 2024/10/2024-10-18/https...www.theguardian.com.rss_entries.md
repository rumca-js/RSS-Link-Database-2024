<p>Peter Dinklage, Josh Brolin, Glenn Close, Marisa Tomei and Brendan Fraser are lost in this brief and silly Amazon caper about low-level criminals</p><p>One thing among many that Joel and Ethan Coen seem to instinctively understand is the art of giving their characters funny names: when and how to drop something pleasingly ornate, when to pull back a little, how to toss them off so they don’t sound self-consciously ostentatious. It’s a delicate art; on paper, a character like Moke Munger (Josh Brolin) or his brother Jady (Peter Dinklage) might sound funny and distinctive. But if you’re not careful, your screenplay will soon be over-explaining them as childhood mispronunciations that stuck, and nonetheless surrounding them with other characters sporting similarly nonsensical names like Farful, Freddie Unk, or Uncle Crabcake. The differences between those monikers and genuine Coen creations like HI McDunnough (from Raising Arizona) or Burt Gurney (from Hail Caesar!) are as precise and

Such were some of the huge costs involved in the production of Gladiator II, which comes to cinemas next month, 24 years after Ridley Scott’s blockbusting original.</p><p>Such conspicuous spending might be assumed to be making studio executives sweat, but Hollywood is banking on the film being a commercial success – particularly given the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/oct/16/why-joker-folie-a-deux-2-lose-money-and-how-did-it-cost-so-much-in-the-first-place">calamitous box office returns</a> for another recen

<p><strong>MK Gallery, Milton Keynes</strong><br>Usually relegated to the roles of hostess, lover or muse, the painter’s independent spirit shines through in the power of the patterns and colours in this, the largest solo show ever devoted to her work</p><p>Vanessa Bell has seduced me. She has offered nothing fancier than bottles and a bowl, by a window that looks out on terracotta roofs and wooded hills. The frame of the window runs just inside the frame of the painting, squeezing the table and its contents into a narrow strip. The stout blue flask is clear as a Cornish sky in May, the delicate stoppered bottle the colour of a midsummer sea. Beyond the claustrophobia of the room lie buildings licked with all the rich red pinks of a rose garden.</p><p>She was aptly named, Bell. At her best, her colours ring with clarity – chiming one against the other yet held distinct. She luxuriates in it, but the spaces she conjures are lived. This is not a mere still life, but a space for bodies,

<p>Todd Phillips’ superhero sequel might have been a box-office flop, but some readers see a lot to cherish in the performances of Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga</p><p>I thought that this was a daring, subversive, melancholic and thought provoking film. Phillips’ decision to avoid simply churning out a repeat of the first film is admirable and Joaquin Phoenix adds more layers to the character of Arthur Fleck. Lady Gaga was captivating as Harley Quinn and together the two leads offer a compelling portrait of loneliness, yearning and human frailty. Once again, Hildur Guðnadóttir’s masterful score adds gravitas and underlines the despair at play. It’s certainly not a perfect film, but its ambition should be applauded and I’m really surprised by the coverage it has received. I’m sure it will come to be seen in a more positive light. <strong>David Markham, 37, Sheffield</strong><strong> </strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/oct/18/daring-or-dire-guardian-readers-on-jo

Sadly, my pay never kept pace with the increasing cost of the best wines.</p><p>Actually, it’s much worse than that: many wines I used to enjoy regularly in my 20s are now prohibitively expensive and, with two young children in tow, I can’t really justify spending more than £20 on a bottle unless it’s for a very special occasion. But this isn’t a woe-is-me column (or not <em>just</em> a woe-is-me column), because my lack of funds combined with my keen interest in wine means that I have become rather good at finding bottles that offer a taste of first class at Ryanair prices.

<p>Labour lets the Taylor Swift story rumble on, while KemiKaze, Honest Bob and Spurs just leave you feeling indifferent</p><p>Herbie is now 13 years old. Which, depending on how you measure it, makes him somewhere in his 80s in dog years. For his last birthday, friends gave him some treats that claim to improve his joints. Now, I took glucosamine for years in a bid to make my knees marginally less creaky and never noticed any improvement. But whatever ingredients – I’m guessing WD40 laced with amphetamines – they’ve put into these doggy ‘joint care’ chews, they appear to have had a miraculous effect. A while back, I wrote about how Herbie had torn a ligament in his back leg and that the vet had recommended surgery. A number of you wrote in to me to say not to bother with the operation. His leg would heal just as well on its own. We took the advice and – guess what? - you were absolutely right. So thank you for saving Herbie a painful operation and three months of rehab and for saving

Those who grew up there are now telling their stories</p><p>When Carol Edwards and her daughter went on a walking weekend to Holnicote House, a hotel on Exmoor in Somerset, a guide gave them a tour of the property, explaining the estate’s 500-year history. “The story ended at about 1945,” Edwards says. “So afterwards, I said to him: ‘You missed a section out.’” Edwards knew this because she had lived at Holnicote House for the first five years of her life, along with 25 other children like her, immediately after the second world war. All of the children were orphans, all were mixed race: their mothers were white British women, their fathers were African American GIs who had been stationed in Britain during the war.</p><p>Edwards was one of what US newspapers would call “brown babies”.

<p>When Copenhagen zoo cut up a giraffe as kids looked on it caused global outrage – Life and Other Problems charts a path between Darwin and Disney to explore what the scandal teaches us animal-human relations</p><p>On a Sunday morning in February 2014, after a favourite breakfast of rye bread, 18-month-old giraffe Marius was killed with a penetrative captive bolt fired at his head by veterinary staff at Copenhagen zoo. His body was later cut up in front of a crowd of visitors that included several open-mouthed children, and then fed to the zoo’s lions.</p><p>Marius was neither dangerous nor ill. The zoo argued he had to die because his genes were too common for him to be suitable for breeding. Avoiding inbreeding, which is what Marius may have ended up doing as a grown male, was crucial to ensure the existence of a healthy giraffe population in European zoos, Copenhagen zoo’s scientific director, Bengt Holst, said at the time.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/oct/1

The Canadian duo’s fourth and final album arrives six years after guitarist Brian King and drummer David Prowse played their last show. With Springsteen-influenced storytelling fuelled by some of the punk intensity from their breakthrough record, 2012’s Celebration Rock, Fate &amp; Alcohol is a classic romance – breathless, hedonistic and wistful – until it’s not.</p><p>King falls in love at a single glance on rock romcom Eye Contact High, made cinematic by Prowse’s rattling, urgent drumming and soaring gang vocals.

<p>Billy Crystal is a child psychologist in a creepy thriller indebted to The Sixth Sense, plus Joshua Jackson plays a doctor on a luxury cruise ship in Ryan Murphy’s daft medical drama</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/billy-crystal">Billy Crystal</a> plays (reasonably convincingly) against type in this thriller, as child psychologist Eli, a man reeling from the suicide of his wife Lynn. When a mysterious, mute child appears on his doorstep with bloodied hands and an unblinking stare, Eli assumes he has dreamed him. But Noah (a creepy turn from Jacobi Jupe) is very real: he is equally drawn to Eli but is unable to explain the roots of his obvious trauma, which manifests in incredibly detailed drawings and episodes of jarring violence. The dialogue is clunky and feels indebted to horror totems The Exorcist and The Sixth Sense. But the intriguing central premise keeps it watchable.<em> </em><em><br>

<p>From the Surrey Hills to the Hebrides, hostels offer affordable lodgings in some of the UK’s most beautiful landscapes. Here are our readers’ top picks</p><p>Four decades after my previous visit to <a href="https://www.yha.org.uk/hostel/yha-eskdale">Eskdale YHA</a> (a scary night-time descent from Scafell), a nostalgic multi-day trek saw me back in one of Lakeland’s quieter hostels. The building’s exterior is unchanged, but, within, I found improved comfort levels and a cheery welcome from Rachel’s dedicated team. After a tasty pie and a decent pint, enjoyed among relaxed company of all generations, I stepped outside to gaze at the surrounding fells bathed in moonlight and wrapped in silence. There’s a bird hide in the grounds and red squirrels visit to feed. And, yes, I walked up Scafell from the hostel’s door. It’s £15 per night per adult in a shared dorm.<br><strong>Paul Gamble</strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2024/oct/18/readers-favourite-uk-hostels-bunk

<p>Living in Marseille, I see how bread is a source of daily joy – but the reality of French bakery is not as charming as it seems</p><p>For many French people, the first experience of being allowed out alone as a child is going to the local bakery. The smell of bread mingles with a sense of newfound freedom as the tip of the baguette, <em>le quignon</em>, is torn off on the way home. This is a romantic story, but it holds some truth about the esteemed role that bread and the baker hold in France – and it is partly what drew me, an English baker, to the country.</p><p>Having worked and lived in Paris and Marseille, I’ve since learned that although there is much to admire about the French relationship to bread, it is all underpinned by a web of political, social and economic relations that make it not as charming as it may seem from the outside. For one, the sale of pre-frozen, industrially made bakery goods is on the rise. The Spanish company Europastry, one of the top producers in th
