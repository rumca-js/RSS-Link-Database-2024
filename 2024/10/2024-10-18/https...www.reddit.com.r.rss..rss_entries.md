<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I need to follow several feeds that include links to URLs I need to save and extract, but they are present in the feed in a non-standard way. Viewing the raw XML of the feed, the URLs are wrapped in custom non-standard HTML tags. Like <code>&lt;reportdataitem:12&gt;&lt;a[...]&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/reportdataitem:12&gt;</code></p> <p>I can extract them easily enough using regex, but that&#39;s only by viewing the current feed file in my browser which only contains the 10 most recent items. I miss all the rest.</p> <p>I can&#39;t find a feed reader app that will display this content. It seems like all that I&#39;ve tried strip out these URLs so that each item appears &quot;blank&quot; (well, shows any standard text from the feed, but that is not what I need access to).</p> <p>Is there any reader app that will just dump the pure raw XML code content of each item? Whether as plaintext &quot;items&quot; in a feed reader format, or even just append each new ite

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi, I recently started setting up my RSS feed, it&#39;s awesome! I&#39;ve long stopped using most social media, but this made me wonder whether there are ways to follow certain pages that I&#39;d still like to keep up with. They&#39;d be public, of course, so it doesn&#39;t seem impossible, but Feedly doesn&#39;t read any Instagram or Linkedin pages. Thanks!</p> <p>P.S. If you have good RSS feed open-source recommendations, please also share. I don&#39;t mind subscriptions, but my requirements are easy setup, good website UI and an iOS app (all of which I could only find with Feedly). </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/1H4rsh"> /u/1H4rsh </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1g6ayr6/rss_for_social_media_instagram_linkedin/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1g6ayr6/rss_for_social_media_instagram_linkedin/">[comments]</a></span>
