They’re not only able to control animals — they can turn <em>into</em> animals (and also cast powerful spells). The result is a class that’s packed with complex ability combinations that can deal massive damage. As such, designing an ideal Druid build is a puzzle in its own right. That’s where we come in, with our suggestions of the best Druid builds for <em>Diablo 4</em> season 6.</p>
