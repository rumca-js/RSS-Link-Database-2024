But I am curious what is the best OSS/locally-runnable crawling AND scraping library is?</p> <p>In terms of scraping, I am lovely Jina AI, so I have that piece kind of set. But I am having trouble finding a crawling library that can handle sites with lots of JS / links, and get a list of all the links on the page which I can then throw to Jina AI to scrape. </p> <p>I am trying Firecrawl too, and while the results are good, I prefer not to subscribe to a SaaS service. If I can run this on my server, I&#39;d rather do that. </p> <p>I&#39;ve used crawl4ai, but they appear to not do the crawling (or I am using it wrong..) </p> <p>Or is it easier to just use a paid service Apify or Firecrawl? Or are there equally good libraries for this?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/WhosAfraidOf_138"> /u/WhosAfraidOf_138
