Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Tim Walz is funding a program in Minnesota that brings children out into the woods to talk about sexuality. But don't worry: we're assured that there's nothing weird about it at all. Also, Donald Trump brutally roasts Kamala and the Democrats at the Al Smith dinner last night. A megachurch pastor has a very unhelpful message for Christians leading into the election. And a white dude for Harris tries his best to diagnose his party's problems with male voters. He gets so close to the answer, yet so far.

Jerry Seinfeld has had an epiphany. He now says that, actually, the woke scolds aren't ruining comedy, as he'd previously claimed.
