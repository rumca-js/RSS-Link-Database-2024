When the original feature length What We Do In The Shadows first debuted, audiences instantly fell in love with the coven of Vampires in Taika Waititi's film.  Though one scene including Werwolves almost stole the show.  So much so that Taika Waititi has been teasing a sequel to What We Do In The Shadows since the documentaries debut.  Though after over a decade, there still is no news on a potential sequel to What We Do In The Shadows.   As the TV Show begins to wrap up on FX, fans everywhere are begging for more stories in the What We Do In The Shadows world more than ever.
