Over the past few months Xbox has made some pretty odd decisions for a console manufacturer. From putting games to competitors platforms, to ignoring important questions about the future of the brand, it’s just been a bad time all around to be an xbox fan. In the past I’ve discussed some of this, but recently things have gotten a lot…weirder.

There’s been more communication, more announcements, more details about where Xbox is heading. Of course, this is what people wanted. More transparency. Problem is, it suggests a direction for Xbox that fans probably won’t appreciate.

So today, I want to talk about all of that.

Or something.
