The present study examined the impact of early life adversity on different stages of neuronal reward processing later in life and their association with a related behavioral phenotype, i.e. attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). 162 healthy young adults (mean age = 24.4 years; 58% female) from an epidemiological cohort study followed since birth participated in a simultaneous EEG-fMRI study using a monetary incentive delay task. Early life adversity according to an early family adversity index (EFA) and lifetime ADHD symptoms were assessed using standardized parent interviews conducted at the offspring's age of 3 months and between 2 and 15 years, respectively. fMRI region-of-interest analysis revealed a significant effect of EFA during reward anticipation in reward-related areas (i.e. ventral striatum, putamen, thalamus), ind

We introduce LLMD, a large language model designed to analyze a patient's medical history based on their medical records. Along with domain knowledge, LLMD is trained on a large corpus of records collected over time and across facilities, as well as tasks and labels that make nuanced connections among them. This approach is critical to an accurate picture of patient health, and has distinctive advantages over models trained on knowledge alone, unlabeled records, structured EHR data, or records from a single health system.
  The recipe for LLMD continues pretraining a foundational model on both domain knowledge and the contents of millions of records. These span an average of 10 years of care and as many as 140 care sites per patient. LLMD is then instruction fine-tuned on structuring and abstraction tasks. The former jointly identify and normalize document metadata, provenance information, clinical named-entities, and ontology mappings, while the latter roll these into higher-level re
