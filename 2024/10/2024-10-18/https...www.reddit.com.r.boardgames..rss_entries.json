Every aspect of Wise Guy\u2019s art looks better and not as dated. </p> <p>Gameplay: I have no clue which one is better. It seemed like they were mainly the same game. I feel like if they are basically the same game, I\u2019d just rather have Wise guys due to the above things, but if SOA is a lot better, I\u2019d probably want to pick that up instead. </p> <p>Anyone have any insight here?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"", "id": 1346240, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1g6aqxf/sons_of_anarchy_or_wise_guys", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 473, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Sons of Anarchy or Wise Guys", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-10-18T05:01:21+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p><strong>Welcome to <a href=\"/r/boardgames\">/r/boardgames</a>&#39;s Daily Game Recommendations</strong></p> <p>This is a place where you can ask any and all questions relating to the board gaming world including but not limited to<a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/meeple#/media/File:Carcassonne_Miples.jpg\">:</a></p> <ul> <li>general or specific game recommendations</li> <li>help identifying a game or game piece</li> <li>advice regarding situation limited to you (e.g, questions about a specific FLGS)</li> <li>rule clarifications</li> <li>and other quick questions that might not warrant their own post</li> </ul> <h2>Asking for Recommendations</h2> <p>You&#39;re much more likely to get good and personalized recommendations if you take the time to format a well-written ask.

My brother in law and his wife play a whole lot of board games and most of them are more complex or have more pieces than I&#39;d like to deal with, but they love them and 3D print their own organizers and even get their 3 and 5 year old to play with them. They love games like Gloomhaven/Frosthaven, Starwars&#39; Imperial Assault and other Starwars games, and 7 Wonders, as well as other strategy games. Interestingly, they don&#39;t like D&amp;D but they love franchises like Legend of Zelda, Pok\u00e9mon, Starwars, and Harry Potter They have a lot of games that require 3+ players but I&#39;m sure they&#39;d also enjoy some 2 player games.
