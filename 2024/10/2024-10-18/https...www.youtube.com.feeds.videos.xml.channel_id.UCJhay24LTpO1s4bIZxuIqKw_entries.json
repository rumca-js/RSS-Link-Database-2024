Whether it be with templates, lambdas, `std::variant` or the more recent addition of ranges, we now have a large collection of tools from the FP toolkit to make our code safer, more composable and more adaptable.\n\nIn this talk, we survey the history of FP in C++ to see how the language has evolved to support the functional programming paradigm, contemplate how modern C++ lets us blur the line between systems programming and functional programming, and take a peek into the future to see how C++ can build on its heritage to advance our ability to write performant, functional code.\n\nSlides: https://accu.org/conf-previous/accu2024/\nSponsored By think-cell\n---\n\nAbel Sen\n\nI am a functional and", "id": 1346737, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmOaBT3i_Hc", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 421, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCJhay24LTpO1s4bIZxuIqKw", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/zmOaBT3i_Hc/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "The Evolution of Functional Programming in C++ - Abel Sen - ACCU 2024", "vote": 0}]
