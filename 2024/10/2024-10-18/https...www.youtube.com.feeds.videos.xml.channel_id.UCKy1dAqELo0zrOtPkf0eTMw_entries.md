Tom Holland gave us a few updates on Spider-Man 4, which he says is worthy of fans' respect. He also shares his desire to see Miles Morales in the MCU, and hopes to be the one to introduce him. This was inspired by his relationship with Robert Downey Jr. and his own journey as SpiderMan. Both movies are poised in a way that could very well make this possibility a reality. Amazon, Sony, and MGM have begun the hunt for new writers for the God of War TV series as Rafe Judkins, Hawk Otsky, and Mark Fergus depart the production. Cory Balrog will still be the executive producer on the project.

In today's Daily Fix:
Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 isn't even out yet, but of course we're getting possible info on the next CoD. According to the latest rumor, 2025's Call of Duty will be another Black Ops game, but will be a sequel to 2012's Black Ops 2. Wouldn't that be 2015's Black Ops 3, you may ask? Chronologically, Black Ops 2 was set in the 1970's and 2025, while Black Ops 3 was set in the 2060's, while next year's game take place in the 2030's and once again star David Mason. In other news, Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii will be arriving in port a week sooner than expected. This is likely to get out of the way of Monster Hunter Wilds. And finally, Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered is more than just a facelift of the original PS4 game, it'll have more random people in settlements—and more geese!

MechWarrior 5: Clans reviewed on PC by Will Borger. Also available on Xbox and PlayStation.
MechWarrior 5: Clans surprised me with its excellent campaign, carried by a thoughtful, well-told story, great mission design, fantastic walking-tank combat, and all of the customization you could want. I genuinely loved playing Clans, especially in co-op, and several story moments and missions will stick with me for a long, long time because of the way they simultaneously made me consider the ethical questions of war while grouping my rockets and lasers to obliterate a target and turning my damaged armor out of harm’s way. I just wish my first playthrough hadn’t been so buggy, especially in co-op. If Piranha’s promised post-launch patches can fix its issues, Clans will have a lot fewer frustrating lows to drag down its many impressive highs – but one way or another, I’ll definitely be suiting up for the Smoke Jaguar Clan for another run in the future.
