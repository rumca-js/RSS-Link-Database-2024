I plan to sail the high seas and would therefore like to pass all my download data through a VPN. I have a mac mini as my server and it is currently running with a VPN and I have docker containers for every service running in my stack. My concern is that my torrents will continue in the event that I have a VPN issue, so I was attempting to set up a separate VPN container that would tunnel all the data from my torrent container. Is this the best/most common approach?</p> <p>Without this new container, I was able to access my qbittorrent server via localhost:8080, but I have been sol since setting up the vpn container. Nothing really looks off in the logs for either container, but maybe I am missing something. Any advice would be much appreciated, or if you have a better approach I would love to hear it.</p> <p>Here is a portion of my yml relating to both containers:</p

At least I wont have limits like I would have with renting a hosting server. + I won&#39;t need to rent another VPS. That is fairly expensive. It&#39;s not like a big deal if I will have a little more downtime. If anything, I might have more uptime as I won&#39;t need to wait on customer service to resolve problems, but fix them myself as soon as anything occurs. Feels like it would pay back within a year of self hosting. I can just get some good CPU, Motherboard, RAM, Storage, PSU. And install all open source software.

Looks reasonable. And Docker. I am not am not actually sure what to ask. Just had a thought now. Maybe someone doing

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello. A little background about me is that I am an advocate for the music industry here in my country. I always wanted to uplift the industry, create an avenue for artists to promote their songs and schedules, and give traction to music stores.</p> <p>In the early 2000s up until the mid 2010&#39;s, we had a forum based on SMF. The community died out because of social media and groups not to mention the rise of mobile technology. Let&#39;s face it, forum based community right now isn&#39;t fun on mobile phones.</p> <p>Before, I have created a marketplace where artists can sell their songs and music stores can upload their products. That failed.</p> <p>So I am looking for an open source, free and self hosted social media of sort that can do the same things as facebook but specific in this industry. Perhaps something like a facebook group feature only. Upload videos, ask questions, create artists page and update their fans and a buy and sell community.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I started using mealie and imported a bunch of recepies from <a href="http://chefkoch.de">chefkoch.de</a> and other sites by scraping urls from certain searches (mostly low carb stuff) and bulk importing them.<br/> I also realized that many of us would have collections of recepies: is it possible ot only export the recepies from an instance and share them? If yes, why are we not sharing our collections?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/retrogod_thefirst"> /u/retrogod_thefirst </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1g6cai0/mealie_recepie_collection/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1g6cai0/mealie_recepie_collection/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone,</p> <p>I&#39;m looking for an ERP that can handle multiple online vendors, warehouses in two countries, and around 1000 shipments to customers and 20-30 between warehouses each month. We have our own product and operate on a small scale.</p> <p>I was thinking about NextERP, but I&#39;m open to other suggestions. Ideally, the ERP would be self-hosted and have the following features (If possible):</p> <ul> <li>Multi-warehouse support</li> <li>Inventory management</li> </ul> <p>I&#39;m also looking for an ERP that is easy to use and has good documentation. If you have any suggestions, please let me know.</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/LordSuricato"> /u/LordSuricato </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1g6aiji/best_selfhosted_erp/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1g6aiji/best_selfhosted_e

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure if this really fits here and I`d be fine with this post getting deleted, but I just finished setting up my new server a few days ago, and I am still in awe of the progress file-sharing has made.</p> <p>Twenty years ago, it took me 20 hours to download a movie that some guy recorded on a camcorder in the cinema, only to find out it was actually a gay porn movie some kid renamed to &quot;Matrix 2 HIGH QUALITY screener 1337 super nice quality DVD RIP.&quot;</p> <p>Of course, file-sharing was less of a gamble when Netflix finally came along but still. Netflix was really good, convenient, and cheap at that time, so I stopped leeching and I was totally okay with paying for a great service like that. Now, you need five different streaming services to get 70% of the content you want to watch, so I made the journey back into the high seas... </p> <p>... and wow... just wow...</p> <p>Now I host my own website that lists every movie and TV show
