New research shows how human activities, like fertilizer use and polluting, are impacting nitrogen-fixing plants which are crucial for maintaining healthy ecosystems by adding nitrogen to the soil.

## Better ocean connectivity boosts reef fish populations

A new study has found that oceanographic connectivity (the movement and exchange of water between different parts of the ocean) is a key influence for fish abundance across the Western Indian Ocean (WIO). Connectivity particularly impacted herbivorous reef fish groups, which are most critical to coral reef resilience, providing evidence that decision-makers should incorporate connectivity into how they prioritize conservation areas.

## Protein shakeup: Researchers uncover new function of a protein that may unlock age-related illnesses

## American lobster population, habitat preferences shifting, study finds

Scientists found that from 1995-2021, occupancy of boulder habitats by lobsters dropped 60%. Meanwhile, the number of lobsters residing in sediment or featureless ledge habitats increased 633% and 280%, respectively. Lobster population density across all types of habitats declined too, but the mean size of an adult lobster was greater in 2021 than in 1996.

## New study urges enhanced recruitment strategies to help address US primary care physician shortages

A new study evaluated the effects of citizenship status on physician specialty choice and practice location among U.S. citizen and non-citizen international medical graduates (IMGs), which account for a quarter of all active physicians in the U.S. Citizenship status has significant effects on IMGs' choices of specialties and practice locations. Though non-citizen IMGs were historically found to be more likely to specialize in primary care and work in rural areas and shortage areas, the proportion has declined over the past decade. Strategies to recruit physicians to specialize in primary care, and especially to practice in underserved areas, should be tailored to the unique characteristics of IMGs.
