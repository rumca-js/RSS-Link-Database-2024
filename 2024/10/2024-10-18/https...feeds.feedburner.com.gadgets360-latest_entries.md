NASA's latest study proposes that meltwater beneath Mars' icy surface could sustain microbial life. Researchers utilised advanced computer modelling to demonstrate that sunlight can penetrate water ice enough to allow photosynthesis in shallow meltwater pools. These pools, which may form in the Martian tropics, could provide a protective environment for potential life forms, similar to Earth’s cryoconite holes. The findings suggest that locations beneath the ice should be prime targets for future exploration. Scientists aim to further investigate these environments and identify areas on Mars where life may exist, opening new avenues for astrobiological research.

An international research team has revealed that 70% of known meteorite falls originate from just three young asteroid families: Karin, Koronis, and Massalia. These families were formed by collisions in the main asteroid belt approximately 5.8, 7.5, and 40 million years ago. The Massalia family alone accounts for 37% of meteorites. This significant discovery has allowed scientists to trace the origins of over 90% of meteorites, enhancing our understanding of these celestial bodies. Ongoing research will focus on identifying the sources of the remaining 10% of meteorites yet to be linked to specific parent bodies.
