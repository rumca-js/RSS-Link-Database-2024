<p>Writer Donald Horne was an astute generaliser in a golden era of them. Can we still examine Australia with his boldness?</p><p>Sixty years ago, Penguin published a small paperback – Donald Horne’s The Lucky Country: Australia in the Sixties. Its cover was adorned by a commissioned painting – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/oct/27/guardianobituaries1">Albert Tucker’s</a> profile of the archetypal Australian – male (of course), probably a returned soldier, his shirt open, beer mug in-hand, the ace of spades in his top pocket. Fronting a familiar, ocean-blue backdrop, Tucker’s granite-faced Aussie filled the frame, soaking up the sunshine. Like Horne’s depiction of Australia, he seemed to have no idea how he’d come to have it so good.</p><p>But visible above the waves, behind the back of Tucker’s Australian bloke, there are four yachts with menacing, shark-like sails. If this is a paradise, it is stalked by danger, haunted by the prospect that the country’s luck was abo

Butterflies fluttered in my stomach constantly. I took any opportunity to mention my love, no matter how tangential to the conversation.

That I was in love with Take That was irrelevant: it was love all the same.</p><p>When the British boyband split up in 1996, the press conference was broadcast live. During the Q&amp;A, a journalist from BBC Manchester told the sombre group: “We’ve just had a 14-year-old fan phone in tears.

<p>The Rue Dix marketplace and restaurant in Crown Heights offers Senegalese fashion and flavor</p><p>Nilea Alexander and her husband, Lamine Diagne, started out with a neighborhood coffee shop in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. Over the past decade, though, their modest enterprise has evolved into what they call “an experience”. Next door to Café Rue Dix, which serves Senegalese cuisine, pastries and lattes, is Marché Rue Dix, their marketplace-boutique stocked with goods sourced directly from Senegal, Diagne’s birthplace. The couple’s goal is to create a one-stop destination where customers leave with both a story and a piece of Senegal.</p><p>Rue Dix, or “10th Street” in French, is a nod to Diagne’s roots in Pikine, a city to the east of the Senegalese capital of Dakar. “Markets are very big in Senegal,” he said. Visitors to the cafe can order its signature dish, thiebou jen – a savory blend of jollof rice, vegetables and red snapper stew. And then they can head to the boutique, which off

Pitted against some skeptical voters, Harris won the room over with her personal stories and willingness to let her hair down some. “I’m all about straight talk, and there’s no better place to do that than in the barbershop,” she said.

 The latest in Banville’s series set in 1950s Ireland begins with a Mercedes, engine still running, abandoned in a field by the sea in County Wicklow. It’s discovered by the reclusive Denton Wymes, who shortly afterwards encounters the “mad, or drunk, or both” Ronnie Armitage, who claims that his wife left the car abruptly and may have drowned herself. The behaviour of the couple in the nearby cottage, where the two men go to phone the police, is no less bizarre. When a search by the coastguards fails to recover a body, Detective Inspector Strafford is sent from Dublin to investigate. Strafford

<p>Planting a tree is a timestamp and a responsibility – it’s going to be there for a long time. Here’s what to think about before you pick and plant one</p><p>Part of gardening’s beauty is the ephemerality of it: taking care of a plot can encourage a rich ecosystem, but a garden only ever exists in the moment you’re bearing witness to it.</p><p>No wonder that planting trees can be alluring and terrifying in equal measure. Such permanence! Such impossibility! A good tree, planted well, will long outlast us – or at least the time we spend in the garden. It’s a&nbsp;timestamp and a responsibility. And now is a good time to do it: the soil is damp and accommodating, and while the tree is nudging towards dormancy its roots are still growing. The leaves will drop soon, so a new tree will put energy into bedding in, before returning to vibrancy in the spring.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/oct/18/want-a-tree-for-the-garden-ask-yourself-these-questions-first">Cont

<p>Trump’s planned rally at Madison Square Garden will be the ultimate act of ego and the climax of his Hitlerian rhetoric</p><p>For the apotheosis of his entire “poisoning of the blood” campaign, Donald Trump has planned a spectacular extravaganza in Madison Square Garden on 27 October, a week before the election. When JD Vance sings Trump’s fulsome praises to introduce him, his ominous tribute will not inspire comparison to the night in the Garden of 19 May 1962, when Marilyn Monroe sang Happy Birthday, Mr President to John F Kennedy.</p><p>Trump’s climactic rally will not be in the spirit of any past presidential event ever held there. His gathering for the great racist replacement theory will be the culmination of his spiraling descent since the Charlottesville rally in 2017 when neo-Nazis chanted, “Jews will not replace us.” “Fine people on both sides,” Trump said then. Now, at his night at the Garden, Trump will revive the memory of the infamous American Nazi mass rally held the

Julian Borger reports</p><p>Since the beginning of its war in Gaza, Israel has been hunting one man in particular – Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar. Described as the mastermind behind the 7 October attack on Israel, he was believed to be hiding deep underground. There were glimpses of him early on, in the tunnels under Gaza – a hostage in her 80s came face to face with him one day, and on 10 October he showed up on Hamas security footage – but nothing more substantial.</p><p>For a year Israeli soldiers have used drones, radar and ground troops to try to find him, while above him in Gaza the death toll among Palestinians grew unimaginably in the heightened conflict he helped to ignite.
