								<p>A bunch of Marvel-themed <strong>Magic: The Gathering</strong> Secret Lairs were unveiled at a New York Comic Con panel on October 18. There are five Secret Lairs in total, each one based around a particular hero. Each contains five cards: a couple of thematic reprints, one or two renamed spells and - most interesting of all - a unique legendary creature depicting the character.</p>

								<p>In a result that left me unsurprised, but genuinely delighted, Modiphius’ Terry Pratchett <strong>Discworld RPG</strong> has made a <em>killing</em> on Kickstarter, racking up nearly $1.4 million (£1 million), more than ten times its initial funding goal, in only three days. I’m unspeakably excited to play - but I confess I was a little disappointed to see no miniatures among the pile of enticing extra knick-knacks offered in the crowdfunder.</p>

								<p>Modrons are one of the best - and most easily overlooked - monster subtype in the whole of the <strong>DnD </strong>Monster Manual. Originating in the lawful neutral plane of Mechanus, they are entities of perfect order, but their rigid adherence to rules can make them hilarious, chaotic, and downright dangerous - a perfect addition to any DnD campaign.</p>

								<p>Many DMs strive for perfect balance in a <strong>Dungeons and Dragons</strong> encounter. You’d <i>think</i>, then, that the best fights in D&amp;D are those where the opponents are equally matched. This isn’t always the case. Sometimes, the unexpected landslide victories are the ones that go down in history. D&amp;D, like life, can often throw a spanner in the works. Or, in the case of my campaign, a magical cabbage.</p>

								<p>The Inquisition Player’s Guide for <strong>Warhammer 40k RPG Imperium Maledictum</strong> went up for pre-order on Thursday, and thanks to an early sample from Cubicle 7 I've had access to it for a few days. I'm surprised and pleased by how useful the contents will be for any kind of campaign, not just ones focused on the Inquisition - and Rogue Traders are particularly well served.</p>

								<p>Sometimes, I simply don’t have time or space for a big board game. As I approach my thirties, it’s only getting harder to get my friends around a table for an eight-hour strategy session. That’s where a game like <b>Scout</b> comes in. This pint-sized circus game may be smaller than a banana, but it’s made a big impact on my gaming habits. I can and <i>do</i> bring Scout everywhere, and it helps me squeeze short gaming sessions in on the regular.</p>

								<p>The <strong>Magic: The Gathering</strong> card Séance Board has seen a sudden price spike. This card, found in the Valgavoth precon deck, was very cheap in the first few weeks after Duskmourn released, valued at just $1. But it’s been spiking for the last seven days, jumping up by a whopping 444%.</p>

## Warhammer 40k: how to make a full 2,000 point army for under $20

								<p>It’s no secret that building a <strong>Warhammer 40k</strong> army is very expensive, particularly a full 2,000 point tournament list. But if you’ve got time, a creative eye, and a big enough bits box, it’s possible to bring that total down substantially by converting, kit-bashing, and scratch-building everything. Ork player Aaron Lee Yaeger has set the bar low: his growing Ork force has so far cost just $10.33.</p>
