<p>Artificial intelligence makers have faced a mountain of criticism for borrowing from the work of others to train its models. Now the world’s largest publishing house is taking steps to ensure its authors don’t have their work plagiarized in the name of progress.</p>

<p>Nightdive Studios has reimagined another cult classic game for modern audiences. <em>Killing Time: Resurrected</em> <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1733170/Killing_Time_Resurrected/">is a refresh of the 1996</a> 3DO and PC original. For the uninitiated, the game was notable at the time for attempting to blend full-motion video (FMV) with a first-person shooter. It truly looked like nothing else when it was released during the heyday of Bill Clinton’s first term as president.</p>
<p>Like most Nightdive remakes, <em>Killing Time: Resurrected</em> isn’t just a simple remaster. This title boasts 4K visuals, a 144Hz frame cap and other modern graphical goodies like anti-aliasing. The menu art and 2D screens have also been redone.</p>

<p>Google’s NotebookLM software <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/notebooklm-update-october-2024/"><ins>just got some cool new features</ins></a> that primarily impact audio overviews. For the uninitiated, the platform’s Audio Overview tool uses AI to whip up an audio summary of a piece of content. It started with written content, but has since <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/notebooklm-can-now-summarize-youtube-videos-160037375.html"><ins>expanded to YouTube videos</ins></a>.</p>
<p>So what’s new? Users can now input specific instructions before generating a “Deep Dive” overview. Google gives examples of tasking the software to focus on a single topic or adjusting the expertise level to suit a particular audience. The company says it’s like “slipping the AI hosts a quick note right before they go on the air.”</p>

<p>Move over Sony, Canon is trying to take the lead in bleeding-edge tech for mirrorless cameras. The company’s new $4,300, 45-megapixel EOS R5 II offers advanced features like eye-tracking autofocus (AF) that can’t be found on any recent Sony model. The new camera is also pushing Sony’s A1 and other models in the key areas of speed, video and autofocus. And it’s arguably more desirable than Canon’s own <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/canon-r1-hands-on-incredible-speed-but-24mp-resolution-may-disappoint-100044085.html">upcoming flagship R1</a> as it has nearly double the resolution.</p> 
<p>I’ve had the R5 II for a few weeks, evaluating not only its practicality and speed for both professionals and serious amateurs, but also how it stacks up against Sony's A1, the gold standard for high-resolution mirrorless cameras. And frankly, I'm impressed.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

It would have limited ads, which the fine print describes as <em>most</em> videos being ad-free, “but you may see video ads on music content and Shorts, and non-interruptive ads when you search and browse.”</p>
<p>The original Premium Lite subscription began testing in Europe in 2021, but it only lasted a few years, being phased out in October 2023. It was very much “lite, lacking the offline or background viewing of the regular Premium subscription.</p>
<p>The pricing model for these early tests in Australia is $9 a month for Premium Lite, compared with $17 a month for full Premium access, roughly in line with the original Lite costs.</p>

But a few gadgets and apps can actually help you sleep better. As tech people, we found ourselves curious whether the great sleep destroyer can instead shepherd us off to dreamland (and leave us better prepared to deal with tomorrow’s hectic day). So we rounded up the apps and devices that have helped us get better sleep — hopefully they can help you catch more z’, too.&nbsp;</p>
