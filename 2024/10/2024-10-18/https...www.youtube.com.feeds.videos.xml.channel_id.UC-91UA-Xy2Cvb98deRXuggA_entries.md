In this video, I break down why return-to-office (RTO) mandates are a joke and explore the real reasons behind them, like inflating commercial real estate and forcing employees to quit without severance. From corporate buzzwords to CEOs making you believe it's all about 'synergy' and 'vibes,' I call out the BS. If you're tired of the same empty promises and want a fresh perspective on corporate life, tune in as we dive into why remote work gives us the balance and freedom we actually need.
