We chose to cover Fleetwood Mac’s “Landslide” because its simplicity speaks volumes. In a world that often pushes for perfectionism and complexity, this song is a beautiful reminder that sometimes the most powerful things in life and music are the simplest. There’s no need for elaborate compositions when a melody can pull at your heartstrings just by being genuine.

For us, “Landslide” is about embracing that simplicity, letting go of the pressure to be perfect, and finding beauty in pure expression. We hope this piano and cello cover resonates with you as much as it does with us. After all, perfection and complexity will always be outshined by authenticity. Enjoy!

We created this original piece inspired by the breathtaking beauty and stillness of Glacier National Park. The serene landscape, with its towering peaks and crystal-clear waters, invites a sense of peace that is hard to put into words. In a world that’s constantly rushing, we wanted to capture the tranquility of this place, where time seems to slow down and the quiet allows you to truly listen.

This music is our reflection of that stillness—a moment to pause, breathe, and let the calm wash over you. We hope you feel the same sense of peace and tranquility that the park inspires in us. Enjoy this journey into the heart of nature.
