Multiplayer support and "several biomes" will feature on day one, but there's plenty of time to evolve given early access is expected to last "about 2 to 3 years."

<img src="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/wishlisted-cat-clean-ocean.jpg?width=1920&height=1920&fit=bounds&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp" /> <p>I'm drawn to the ocean, whether it's watching programmes about the big blue mystery that covers most of our world to spending days swimming in the sea when on vacation or listening to crashing waves to relax. Something about the ocean is deeply soothing to me. So when I saw there was a Steam Next Fest demo for Cat Clean Ocean, I dove at the chance to give it a shot to try and find a few moments of calm among the stress and chaos of everyday life - and I was not disappointed.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cat-clean-ocean-is-a-chilled-out-cleaning-game-that-reminds-us-about-the-state-of-our-seas">Read more</a></p>

Blizzard in particular was famous for what we'd now call "post-launch DLC", updating the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/starcraft">StarCraft</a>, Warcraft and Diablo with incredible upgrades that extended beloved storylines while adding on much-needed polish and complexity for players in love with their games. To my intense joy, Vessel of Hatred is very much a Blizzard expansion pack in that classic mould, continuing the cliff-hanger ending of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a>, adding on a wickedly fun new character class and cleaning up some of the cruft that had accumulated over five seasons of play.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-review">Read more</a></p>
