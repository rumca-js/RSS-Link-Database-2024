<p>Deepak Jain, CEO of a Maryland-based IT services firm, has been indicted for fraud and making false statements after allegedly falsifying a Tier 4 data center certification to secure a $10.7 million contract with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>



<p>The charges, filed by the US Department of Justice (DOJ) and made public on Wednesday, claim that Jain and his co-conspirators deceived the SEC by creating a fictitious certifier, “Uptime Council,” to falsely verify his firm’s <a href="https://www.networkworld.com/article/969402/what-are-data-centers-how-they-work-and-how-they-are-changing-in-size-and-scope.html">data center</a> as meeting the highest reliability standards.</p>

<p>Apple released a claustrophobic submarine movie for Apple Vision Pro earlier this month, and it gave me a sinking feeling. </p>



<p>The movie <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjvzQeqoGRg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Submerged</a></em> was neither augmented reality (AR) nor virtual reality (VR) nor 360-degree video. It was more like 180-degree video. According to reviews, the experience was as immersive as a submarine with a hole in it.</p>
