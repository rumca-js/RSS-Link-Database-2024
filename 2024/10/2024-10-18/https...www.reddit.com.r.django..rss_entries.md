This is a copyediting tool that uses OpenAI to make changes to prose or a resume. After submitting the text and getting back the results, the user sees their article in a workshop page, where they can accept and reject changes.</p> <p>See the deployed project here: <a href="https://copypasteeditor.com/">https://copypasteeditor.com/</a></p> <p>You can login to a demo account with &quot;tester&quot; as both username and password. You can even try submitting some text in the &#39;Uploader&#39; page without providing an API key. Just keep in mind, it will show up in the &#39;Workshop&#39; area where anyone else on the tester account can see the results. (The project is currently running off my key, with a $5 monthly cap. That&#39;s enough for people to test out a few thousand words each, but please don&#39;t put your entire novel through it!)</p> <

There&#39;s no need to wrap Faker or use all sorts of custom attributes to make the model work. It&#39;s just a simple python dictionary with a provided faker instance. In addition, I&#39;ve tried my best to include helpful typing hints. Django Simple Factory also allows for related factories to use strings instead of the full factory name.</p> <p>It also differs from <code>model_bakery</code> in that there&#39;s an actual factory class that you can interact with and modify.</p> <p>In addition, there&#39;s a helper mixin for <code>unittest.TestCase</code> which allows easy use of the factories in tests.</p> <p>I just pushed an update to allow <code>django-style</c

## Do you set null=True for an optional CharField with choices?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m struggling a bit with this decision. Suppose you have a CharField like this:</p> <p><code> status = models.CharField( max_length=50, choices=StatusChoices, blank=True ) </code></p> <p>The selection of a choice is optional; an empty value will be stored as an empty string. However, conceptually the field should be treated as an enum, as it can contain only one of several predefined values (or no value). Using null to represent an empty value here seems more &quot;correct.&quot;</p> <p>But the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/ref/models/fields/#null">Django documentation</a> specifically warns against this:</p> <blockquote> <p>Avoid using null on string-based fields such as CharField and TextField. If a string-based field has <code>null=True</code>, that means it has two possible values for “no data”: NULL, and the empty string. In most cases, it’s redundant to have two possible values for “no data;” the Django convention is to use

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello everyone,first time for me to post here and hope y&#39;all doing great</p> <p>I have been learning django-django rest framework and decided to put my learning on a project while learning so I started to build and learn I&#39;m currently in the authentication process and managed to setup an authentication system for multiple user roles,now I want to enhance it with MFA/2FA but I was facing a lot of problems with the available packages of MFA for django(I want the MFA to be handled by DRF API but the available solutions designed to work with the regular django) I tried to build my own MFA setup from scratch with pyOTP but faced some problems and now I&#39;m looking for any way or an idea how to implement MFA in my API. Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/donjahnmy"> /u/donjahnmy </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/1g6byr2/help_with_mfa2fa_for_drf/">[link]</a>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>From my experiment, i have stumbled upon an hypothesis that ListCreateAPIView is relatively slower that APIView. I wrote these two views in django, the APIView shows it did 9 sql queries and ListCreateAPIView did 2300 sql queries as shown by django debug toolbar, why is that so?</p> <pre><code>class LabAnalyzerListView(APIView): search_fields = [&#39;facility__name&#39;] def get(self, request, *args, **kwargs): queryset = FacilityEquipment.objects.all() search_filter = filters.SearchFilter() filter_backend = DjangoFilterBackend() queryset = search_filter.filter_queryset(request, queryset, self) queryset = filter_backend.filter_queryset(request, queryset, self) serializer = FacilityEquipmentListSerializer(queryset, many=True) return Response(serializer.data) class LabAnalyzerListView(generics.ListCreateAPIView): queryset = FacilityEquipment.objects.all() serializer_class = FacilityEquipmentListSerializer filter_backends = [DjangoFilterBackend, filters.

## Should I extend Django's roles and permissions, or should I create my own roles and permissions layer?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello everybody, I want to develop a project management web app as a learning experience, and I have thought about the functionality of the roles and permissions for the users of the web app. Should I extend the Django system and not get too complicated, or should I keep the project roles separate? And about the users? I have also thought about adding specific things like: &quot;You can mark a task as completed&quot;, &quot;You can see all the team&#39;s tasks&quot; etc. Thank you in advance for taking the time to read and leave your recommendations.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/OkApplication8622"> /u/OkApplication8622 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/1g69h7g/should_i_extend_djangos_roles_and_permissions_or/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/1g69h7g/should_i_extend_djangos_roles_and_permissions_or/">[comments]</a><
