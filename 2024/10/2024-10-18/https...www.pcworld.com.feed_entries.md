<p>I watch a lot of YouTube. I don’t watch any ads. And <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2419276/i-block-every-ad-on-youtube-and-im-not-ashamed.html">I refuse to pay $14 per month for YouTube Premium</a> on principle. Maybe Google can tempt me onto the straight-and-narrow with a cheaper “Premium Lite” option?</p>



<p>YouTube is now testing that very thing, a stripped-down subscription option that omits certain features like video downloads and background listening. Oh, but it still has advertising in YouTube Music, in search results, and on Shorts. Yeah, I’m still gonna pass.</p>



<p>This update Premium Lite plan is being tested in Australia, Germany, and Thailand, <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/youtube-premium-lite-return-3491130/">according to Android Authority</a>. Google previously offered Premium Lite in a few markets in Europe, wh

<p>Online shooters can get contentious, so it’s no surprise that they’re filled with cheaters and regular players whose behaviors get them banned.</p>



<p>But some hackers were able to exploit <em>Call of Duty</em>‘s automated anti-cheating system to get innocent players banned, simply by sending them one line of text in a direct message. That’s right, a single message from a stranger would get your account permanently disabled.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/17/24272984/activision-anti-cheat-hack-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii-warzone">The Verge reports</a> that hackers who sold cheats for <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III</em> and <em>Call of Duty: Warzone</em> bragged of their exploit on Twitter. The Ricochet anti-cheat system apparently scanned player files for text including the phrase “trigger bot,” so sending someone a messag

## Asus’ new power supply has a ‘magnetic OLED’ screen, because why the hell not

<p>If your fancy PC case is basically going to be just a giant collection of tempered glass panels, I suppose you might as well fill it up with something worth looking at — like <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2304315/gigabyte-xtreme-ice-rtx-gpu-and-motherboard-pimp-your-pc.html">screens on your motherboard</a>, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2030992/all-in-one-water-cpu-coolers-advantages-disadvantages-tips.html">screens on your water block</a>, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/563438/you-dont-need-a-tiny-monitor-for-your-ram-but-thermaltake-will-sell-you-one-anyway.html">screens on your RAM</a>…</p>



<p>How about a screen on your power supply, too? Why the hell not, says Asus, with its latest ROG Thor PSU.</p>



<p>To be fair, the “magnetic OLED display” on the massive ROG Thor 1600W Titanium III <em>does</em> serve a purpose.

<p>Most people in the US who have flagship phones with mainstream carriers are on 5G networks. And while 5G tech is noticeably faster than its predecessors, it’s still weak compared to Wi-Fi and fiber internet.</p>
