The Evolution of Functional Programming in C++
Functional Programming in CPlusPlus - History and Evolution - Abel Sen - ACCU 2024
---

Functional programming (FP) is becoming an increasingly important paradigm that affects the way we write code in C++. Whether it be with templates, lambdas, `std::variant` or the more recent addition of ranges, we now have a large collection of tools from the FP toolkit to make our code safer, more composable and more adaptable.

In this talk, we survey the history of FP in C++ to see how the language has evolved to support the functional programming paradigm, contemplate how modern C++ lets us blur the line between systems programming and functional programming, and take a peek into the future to see how C++ can build on its heritage to advance our ability to write performant, functional code.
