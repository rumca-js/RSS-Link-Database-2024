Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the Kamala campaign is losing men by a wide margin, and it may cost them the election. But why are male voters so repulsed by Kamala Harris, and the Democrat Party in general? We'll talk about it. Also, JD Vance humiliates the propagandist media yet again. More states move away from Columbus Day in favor of the fake holiday known as "Indigenous Peoples’ Day." And a large percentage of young people — especially young women — say that mental illness is an important part of their identity.
