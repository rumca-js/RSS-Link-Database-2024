<p>Open source application packages, including those in Python and JavaScript, have a vulnerability in their entry points that could be used by threat actors to execute malicious code to steal data, plant malware, and more.</p>



<p>This warning to developers and infosec leaders comes in <a href="https://checkmarx.com/blog/this-new-supply-chain-attack-technique-can-trojanize-all-your-cli-commands/">a report</a> released today by researchers at Checkmarx.</p>



<p>They dub the techniques “command jacking,” because attackers can use entry points to run specific commands impersonating popular third-party tools and system commands. But attackers could also leverage malicious plugins and extensions.</

<p>The world has come to rely upon the free work of millions of skilled software developers—the maintainers of <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3429076/what-is-open-source-software-open-source-and-foss-explained.html">free open-source software</a> (FOSS) projects. But the world hasn’t given them a tip. While it’s true that many open-source maintainers are passionate and contribute freely to the cause, others feel downtrodden or taken advantage of.</p>



<p>“We continue to experience maintainer inequity in open source,” says Kevin Crosby, senior director of open source funding at <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3267565/what-is-github-more-than-git-version-control-in-the-cloud.h
