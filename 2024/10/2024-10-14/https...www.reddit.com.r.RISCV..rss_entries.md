<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>16-bit ISA&#39;s are still used by Texas Instruments, Western Digital, and Microchip for embedded, IoT, control systems. I am curious why there is not an 16-bit ISA for RISCV? There is the extension &quot;C&quot; compressed instructions or RVC but this is not a complete ISA.</p> <p>I am working on a design project and considering adapting one from RISCV. Thoughts from anyone?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/cameronbed"> /u/cameronbed </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1g3ixzw/why_is_there_no_16bit_isa_for_riscv_considering/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1g3ixzw/why_is_there_no_16bit_isa_for_riscv_considering/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I executed SPEC-CPU 2017 benchmarks on MILK-V Pioneer Box with SoC SG2042.</p> <p>The result is posted at: <a href="https://cloud-v.co/blog/risc-v-1/benchmarking-risc-v-milk-v-pioneer-box-with-spec-cpu2017-multicore-intrate-17">https://cloud-v.co/blog/risc-v-1/benchmarking-risc-v-milk-v-pioneer-box-with-spec-cpu2017-multicore-intrate-17</a></p> <p>If you need access to the MILK-V Pioneer box, post your info at &quot;Get Access&quot; on the same website and I will check it out (not adding the link here since I got banned frequently for adding links).</p> <p><strong>Edit:</strong> This is just SPEC-CPU 2017 intrate (integer benchmark for multi-thread performance). I have also executed single-threaded benchmarks. Other than that I have also executed floating point benchmarks with multi-thread as well as single-thread settings. I will post them once I have compiled all the results.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.red
