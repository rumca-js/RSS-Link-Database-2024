The United States is the only democracy in the world where a presidential candidate can get the most popular votes and still lose the election. Thanks to the Electoral College, that has happened five times in the country's history. The most recent examples are from 2000, when Al Gore won the popular vote but George W. Bush won the Electoral College after a U.S. Supreme Court ruling, and 2016, when Hillary Clinton got more votes nationwide than Donald Trump but lost in the Electoral College.

Like Earth, Mars was formed about 4.5 billion years ago, but its early surface was very different than today's. Mars' surface then had high rates of meteorite and asteroid impacts from the period known as the Late Heavy Bombardment. But whereas today's Mars is cold, arid, has two icy poles, with an oxidizing atmosphere—where, for example, iron-rich materials develop rust—early Mars was characterized by icy highlands, episodic warmth and a reducing atmosphere.

Scientists have debated the purpose of the ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) produced by rodents since the discovery of these sounds in the 1950s. There's a wide research consensus suggesting USVs are a form of social communication, a courtship display, which though inaudible to humans, might otherwise be compared to the calls of certain birds.

My daughter immediately asked, in short succession: "What colors do they see? Why? How do we know?" I did some homework to find out, and discovered that bees see flowers much differently than we do. If anything, they are more beautiful.
