When installing Ubuntu using Raspberry Pi Imager, I&#39;ve set it up with one WiFi network which it manages to connect to. However, now I want to connect to other WiFi networks, but it seems to refuse to acknowledge any other WiFi networks. I&#39;ve tried using &quot;nmcli dev wifi list&quot; to scan for wifi networks, including using the --rescan option, but it does not show any WiFi networks at all, even though there are definitely wifi networks in the area. &quot;nmcli device&quot; also shows wlan0 as unavailable. I&#39;ve used raspi-config as well to connect to an SSID manually, but it gave an error saying &quot;There was an error running option S1 Wireless LAN&quot;. I&#39;ve added the connections to nmtui as well to no avail. I&#39;ve also used nmcli to connect to an SSID, but it just says the network isn&#39;t found even though I can see it on other d
