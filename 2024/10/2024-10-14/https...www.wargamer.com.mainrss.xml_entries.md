								<p>The latest preview for <strong>Warhammer 40k</strong>’s skirmish spinoff Necromunda, the Squat Scout Trike, is another absolute winner. It’s both a loving call-back to the original Squat range from Warhammer 40k’s first edition, and a weird, cumbersome, gnarly bit of sci-fi hardware that would look right at home in the pages of the comic 2000AD or John Blanche’s sketchbook. And once again I'm left wondering - why isn’t Warhammer 40k this cool?</p>

								<p>The <strong>MTG card</strong> Enduring Innocence has seen a pretty sudden price spike, leaping from $2.80 a fortnight ago, to $10 today. This Duskmourn card is outperforming the rest of the ‘Enduring’ cycle, as its card draw ability is helping it see play in a load of different decks. If you have a white deck that plays lots of little creatures, it could probably use this card.</p>

								<p>Games Workshop released a new range of plastic models for the Horus Heresy Mechanicum faction this year, including some excellent big stompy robots, but to the frustration of Adeptus Mechanicus players, there are no official rules to use them in <strong>Warhammer 40k</strong>. Aspiring techno-adept Warren Roberts has bridged the gap with a set of unofficial datasheets to bring these venerable war machines into the grim darkness of the 41st millennium.</p>
