It seems like Ubisoft is running on burrowed time. Okay, to be fair, it’s felt like that for a while now. After all, with so many failures, it was only a matter of time before the company would go under, right? Well, while Ubisoft is still around, I think it’s safe to assume that something has gone horribly wrong. Investors seem to want change.

The fate of the entire corporation seems to hinge on Assassin’s Creed Shadows, which has been delayed from its initial release from November 2024, into 2025.

Today I want to talk about what’s gone wrong, and why I personally don’t think anything can save this company from the inevitable.
