He filmed enough for just two episodes, and this look at the benefits of cold showers is the first. Each instalment of the podcast was a short slice of simplicity. In less than 15 minutes, usually, Mosley would examine the idea that one easy shift in habits could improve your health. From doing yoga to eating nuts, from dancing to scoffing (a small amount of) dark chocolate and drinking coffee, his warm approach to discussing body and mind made change seem easy, understandable and, crucially, possible.</p><p>Here, he sticks to the Just One Thing format, but it’s longer and has visuals, so we get to see the

 It’s definitely an issue, and given how many players have talked about workload in public, you can be sure it’s something they’re discussing privately. The problem really is how action could be organised. It’s only elite players who are playing too many games; those lower down the pyramid probably wouldn’t mind a few more games for extra cash.

<p>We’ve all been there. We’ve all felt like a badly made-up, odd-limbed, irritable floor-dwelling mess</p><p>As you contemplate the wonders of evolution, and how a creature can be born with something weird and new, and that thing can either help it get ahead or not hurt its chances, and it can then reproduce and make another one like it, spare a thought for the red-lipped batfish.</p><p>A real animal, it has the kind of mouth that, as a kid, you may have made from Babybel cheese wax, to go with your red wax fake nails. It has a beard of white whiskers. It has fins that bend backwards, like a person’s arms at yoga when they are about to do upward dog. Before your eyes, it sprouts a new limb from its nostril. Its nose – technically a snout – is long, at the top of its head, and hook-shaped. It cannot swim, only crawl. Its crawl is more like a waddle.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/commentisfree/2024/oct/15/a-red-lipped-batfish-is-there-anything-creepier">Continue

Italians walk to places! They walk to enjoy fresh air! Do you know Italians cook their own meals, like, every day?
