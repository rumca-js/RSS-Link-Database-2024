## Morgan: Metal Detective is a cosy Steam Next Fest game that I hope can match my favourite BBC dramedy

On the surface, it's a fairly twee tale about a pair of friends who love the bond their love of metal detecting gives them, but look deeper and you'll find a treasure trove of human emotion and life. I'm hoping that's what Morgan: Metal Detective will offer. The Steam Next Fest demo, available now, is a little short, but there's promise here.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/morgan-metal-detective-is-a-cosy-steam-next-fest-game-that-i-hope-can-match-my-favourite-bbc-dramedy">Read more</a></p>

I say 'fidgety', as this is arguably about as far away from a traditional puzzle game as you can possibly get. For example, each of its 100+ scenarios aren't there so much to be 'solved' as to be prodded, poked and pushed to find out exactly how much restless fun you can cram into life's little idle moments - waiting in line at a theme park, say, or waiting for your luggage to arrive at the airport carousel.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dont-wait-to-play-the-steam-next-fest-demo-for-fun-fidget-sim-while-waiting">Read more</a></p>
