However, in the same breath, Clinton argued that the United States needs to import foreign nationals because not enough Americans are having children.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Bill Clinton: Laken Riley's death "probably wouldn't have happened" if the border had been secured by Kamala Harris.<br/><br/>He said this while campaignin

However, the Constitution was never intended for the government or its employees to limit Americans, as it was solely intended to restrict them.

That alone proves she disrespects the American people, as her narcissism is stronger than both her lack of self-awareness and her insecurities that shine through. </p><p>Additionally, the content of Kamala’s skin was not the saving grace the left hoped for. Subsequently, she is becoming increasingly less popular with the American people by the day. However, the Dems cannot afford to lose votes from any minority groups, which is why they have gon

And while reporters act as PR crisis agents for the Democratic Party, they would rather repeat leftist talking points than do their job. </p><p>So when New York Times reporter Lulu Garcia-Navarro pretended to press Vance on the issues at hand, she really tried to push her propaganda, as the left often believes saying the same thing repeatedly makes it truthful. Unclear if that’s why it’s so easy for Vance to flip the script on her and prove to t

The shows exist to set the narrative for politics (as emailed to the press by Democrat strategists). Vance is a narrative-destroying machine and makes journalismers look ridiculous in the process. You almost feel bad for them. Then you remember the media is the enemy of the people so, like, f*ck 'em.</p><p>Yesterday's victim was Martha Raddatz. The narrative was about illegal immigration.

They expected everyone to hate Donald Trump enough to ignore that she has been vice president for the last four disastrous years, and Americans are not doing that. In an act of desperation, she sent Tampon Tim Walz out for a, and I quote, "man-focused media blitz," thinking shiny objects would appeal to fellas. Then our greatest living president Dave Portnoy had an anti-Kamala rant to get off of his chest, and Walz's cosplay was all for naught.</p><p>Portnoy, as the owner of Barstool Sports, represents media that guys actually consume.
