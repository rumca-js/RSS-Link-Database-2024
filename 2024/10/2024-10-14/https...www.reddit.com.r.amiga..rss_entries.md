## Why didn’t games use extra halfbrite?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>As per title, seems like a low-cpu way to add impressive looking dynamic shadows to a game. Anyone know why it wasn’t used more?</p> <p>For those who don’t know, it’s a graphics mode that uses one more bit per pixel, to mark if the pixel should be half its normal brightness, without any extra colours in the palette. Deluxe Paint III onwards could use it.</p> <p>Could the blitter chip turn on halfbrite to match the shape of a two colour shadow sprite?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/joombar"> /u/joombar </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1g3o57x/why_didnt_games_use_extra_halfbrite/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1g3o57x/why_didnt_games_use_extra_halfbrite/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>There used to be this video on Youtube with a bunch of obscure Amiga tracks. The one I&#39;m looking for was listed as Jazzamatazz (no relation to the album by Guru). It was kind of like a hip hop instrumental/dance music hybrid, built around jazz &amp; brass samples. The rest of the songs in the video were nothing like it (most were house tracks). I haven&#39;t heard a single piece of Amiga music quite like it.</p> <p>There are a couple other bits of info I remember from comments left by the uploader. The background pic of the video was taken from the June 1959 cover of this magazine called &quot;Girl Watcher.&quot; They also mentioned that they found a lot of their music off of old CDs and tapes (which makes me even less confident I&#39;m ever gonna find this).</p> <p>I already looked this up on an archive website, turned up a single track, also called Jazzamatazz by the artist Prodigy. It&#39;s a completely different song than what I&#39;m looking
