<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>A podcast I enjoy posts transcripts for each individual episode on their website. I would like to scrape the text of all individual podcast transcripts and store them in one place so that I can search for keyword terms across every episode. (I think it would be fine to store the combined transcripts in a Word doc, or perhaps a very simple website. Doesn&#39;t need to be anything fancy.) <a href="https://dividedargument.com/episodes/separation-of-powers-police/transcript">Here is an example of one of the episode transcripts.</a></p> <p>I have very rudimentary R skills. I attempted to web scrape the individual episode pages using R but I think the podcast website&#39;s being coded in Javascript caused issues with the code I was running? (I was able to successfully scrape non-Javascript sites). </p> <p>Before I continue down the rabbit hole, I wanted to check in with some more experienced folks and ask for any advice. The task at hand seems straightforwa

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Quick question;</p> <p>I am using flaresolverr to scrape cloudflare protected sites and it works quite well, but I&#39;m having an issue with sites that need JS to render the html I need AND are cloudflare protected.</p> <p>I know I can use something like puppeteer, but it can&#39;t solve the cloudflare challenge even if I activate &quot;stealth mode&quot;. Flaresolverr solves the challenge, but returns the html pre-JS.</p> <p>I want to try feeding the cookie returned by flaresolverr in puppeteer to see if that works, but I&#39;d like to know if any of you faced this situation and how you solved it.</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Mountain-Ad4507"> /u/Mountain-Ad4507 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1g3lwze/scraping_js_cloudflare_sites/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1g3lwze/scraping_js_clo
