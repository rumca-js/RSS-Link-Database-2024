Montech just released its King 65 Pro case, which we're reviewing and benchmarking vs. the Montech King 95 Pro in like-for-like glass fronted tests. We'll also talk about the differences and comparison between the King 95 and King 65 cases. The King 95 Pro has maintained an overall acceptable thermal performance (and in some places, good performance); however, the King 65 Pro unfortunately loses much of this ground by sacrificing 3 of its fans and still having the chassis obstructions found on both the 95 and 65 cases. This drops its performance to a less competitive range on the charts, despite its competitive value positioning.
