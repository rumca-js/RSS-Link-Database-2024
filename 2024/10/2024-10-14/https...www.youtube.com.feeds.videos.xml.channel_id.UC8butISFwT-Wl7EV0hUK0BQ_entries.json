This project will cover both frontend and backend development from the ground up.\n\nAs a MERN stack project, we'll be using React for the frontend, Node.js and Express.js for the\nbackend, and MongoDB as our database. We'll also leverage technologies like Tailwind CSS,\nRedux, RTK Query Toolkit, Mongoose, and JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to enhance our project.\n\nOur bookstore will feature an admin dashboard for managing books, a cash-on-delivery system, and a robust inventory management system. Users can easily add or remove products from their carts, proceed to checkout, and place orders. For admins, we'll create a secure admin dashboard accessible with a username and password. Admins will have the power to upload new books, manage and update existing book\ninformation, and delete books as needed.\n\n\ud83d\udcbb Starter Files: https://github.com/mdalmamunit427/book-store-app-ui-assets.git\n\ud83d\udcbb Full Source code: https:/", "id": 1322509, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgw2KPfgK1E", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 422, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC8butISFwT-Wl7EV0hUK0BQ", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/pgw2KPfgK1E/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Build a Full Stack Book Store App Using React, Node, MongoDB", "vote": 0}]
