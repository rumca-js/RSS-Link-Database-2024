The deal targets adding 500 megawatts of nuclear power from the small modular reactors (SMRs) by the decade’s end. The first is expected to be up and running by 2030, with the remainder arriving through 2035.</p>
<p>It’s the first-ever corporate deal to buy nuclear power from SMRs. Small modular reactors are smaller than existing reactors. Their components are bui

<p>The head of Xbox Game Studios Alan Hartman is set to retire at the end of November, marking an end to 30 years working at Microsoft. Appointed to succeed him is Craig Duncan, the studio head of Rare, which was acquired by Microsoft in 2002.

<p>Bungie seems to have set its sights on the mobile games market, as <em>Destiny: Rising</em>, a new mobile sci-fi RPG shooter title, is coming to Android and iOS.

<p><em>Destiny: Rising</em> is set in a different timeline from <em>Destiny </em>and <em>Destiny 2</em>, but NetEase promises players they’ll meet some familiar faces and new ones. The narrative is focused on a time after the Dark Age. Players will get to explore Earth after “The Collapse” and see how humanity tries to recover from a loss of civilization.</p>

<p>I have absolutely nothing negative to say about <em>Neva</em>. As a story, <em>Neva </em>is a living fairy tale that plays out in dreamlike scenes of natural beauty, starring two creatures bonded by tragedy and propelled by an intense need to protect each other — and save the world in the process. As a game, <em>Neva</em> offers exquisite swordplay and intuitive platforming action, with a contained suite of abilities that evolves purposefully with each new stage. As a piece of art, every frame of <em>Neva</em> is breathtaking.</p> 
<p>This is what a faultless game looks like. This is how it feels to play something perfect.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>Alba is the protagonist in <em>Neva</em> and she’s badass. When we meet her, she’s a seasoned warrior and nomad with a cloud of silver hair, dancer’s limbs, and a billowing red cape that hides a slender sword. Her wolf companion, Neva, is just a cub at first, easily distracted and still learning how to navigate the fo
