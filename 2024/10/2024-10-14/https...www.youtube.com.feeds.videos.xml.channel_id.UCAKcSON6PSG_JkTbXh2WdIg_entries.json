Not long after, they were signed to @atorecords and have been on a steady track of touring and recording. During a recent visit to The Current studio, the band performed a set of songs (to be published on this website on Wednesday, Oct. 23), after which lead vocalist Wes Leavins sat down for a conversation with Jill Riley.\n\nIn a fun and candid conversation, Leavins talks about his Texas roots and what drew him to Chicago, where Brigitte Calls Me Baby are based. Leavins also sheds light on the origins of the band\u2019s name, and how they came to work with producer extraordinaire Dave Cobb. Watch and listen to the interview above.\n\nCredits\nGuests \u2013\u00a0Wes Leavins of @brigittecallsmebaby \nHost \u2013\u00a0Jill Riley\nProducers \u2013\u00a0Derrick Stevens, Nilufer Arsala\nAudio \u2013\u00a0Eric Xu Romani\nVideo \u2013\u00a0Megan Lundber", "id": 1321623, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVz-nM4HTWc", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 335, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCAKcSON6PSG_JkTbXh2WdIg", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/gVz-nM4HTWc/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Interview: Wes Leavins of Brigitte Calls Me Baby", "vote": 0}]
