Clostridium perfringens (C. perfringens) is a widespread bacterium found in the intestines of animals and humans, known for causing severe enteric diseases. It produces over 20 toxins, with the β-2 toxin (CPB2) being linked to intestinal infections. CPB2, first identified in piglets with necrotizing enterocolitis, has since been found in multiple species. However, there is limited understanding of its genomic context and role in host adaptation. Due to these knowledge gaps, further research on the cpb2 gene and its role in pathogen evolution is essential.
