<p><strong>British Museum, London<br></strong>In a show full of beauty and horror, which even includes ‘Jamaica’s Elgin Marbles’, the artist places his own works alongside those plundered by Britain from long-destroyed peoples<strong><br></strong></p><p>Part history lesson, part crime scene, Hew Locke’s What Have We Here? is filled with beauty and horror. At the heart of the show, in the Great Court Gallery of the British Museum in London, are looting and vandalism, the destruction of societies, the erasure of cultures and the enslavement of their peoples. All are embedded in the British Museum’s own history and holdings. And that’s without even touching on the frieze of sculptures from the Parthenon in Athens, and the sorry story of their acquisition, or to whom exactly many of the other objects in the museum might be returned, even if there was a will to do so.</p><p>Where are the pre-Columbian Caribbean Taino people now, whose hardwood spirit-figures of a birdman and of Boinayel th

<p>From Sly Stallone at the White House to Hulk Hogan at the RNC, Donald Trump has made no secret of his affinity for hyper-masculine men.

The awards are sure to flood in</p><p>Mr Loverman, adapted from the Booker prize-winning author Bernardine Evaristo’s novel, is about what it means to have a good life built on lies.

Barry is a charming 75-year-old dandy (we move with him through the decades and the costume department plays a&nbsp;blinder throughout) and a successful businessman, husband, beloved father and grandfather.</p><p>He is also the secret lover, for 50 years and counting, of Morris De La Roux (Ariyon Bakare).

Born in apartheid-era South Africa, she spent her childhood in the now-defunct Republic of Transkei, a nominal state set up by the government as a “homeland” for Xhosa-speaking Black Africans. Though ostensibly offering independence, in reality, these territories were a manifestation of segregationist supremacy. Paradoxically, life in Transkei shielded Bongela from the more visible forms of white hatred and it was only when her family moved to a mixed area in the 1990s that she was awakened to the racialised reality of South Africa.</p><p>Bongela’s film is haunted by the disorientation and the guilt that result from this experience of growing up inside an apartheid experiment yet remaining bl

<p>We’re constantly told that passion is what makes work fulfilling. But can being head over heels have its downsides?</p><p>A few years ago, I went to a retirement event for someone who, in his late 80s at the time, had spent more than 60 years as a professor at New York University.

Over the years he had managed to teach 100,000 students the university’s Introduction to Psychology course. Ted is one of those institutional pillars who can tell you what the place was like in 1965.

For a few months now, I’ve been obsessively watching videos of men trying period pain simulators. The machines have wired abdominal pads that send electrical impulses controlled by a console that can replicate the ferocity of cramps on a range of one to 10. Often by five or six on the dial, men are groaning or even screaming in agony while their female partners, also hooked up to the machine, sit unfazed.</p><p>Like many, many women, I am habituated to a certain level of pain. From girlhood, we go about our lives in varying levels of agony, often with the people around us knowing little of our discomfort. There are days, though, when it all becomes too much.

The comment was seized on by the Trump campaign, who have used it in an attempt to seize upon Biden’s unpopularity and blame Harris for the issues that seem to most enrage and terrify their supporters, among them high consumer prices and immigration. But the comment also rankled some members of Harris’s own base: namely, the young, progressive and non-white voters who have been distraught over the suffering inflicted by Israel in its US-backed war on Gaza.</p><p>If Harris can’t think of any way she would differ from Biden, these voters may have some suggestions for her.

<p>So the late queen mother’s handbag was empty all along.

She had never taken to our daughter, who was born nine months previously, put out by her usurper in the way of Big Brother contestants when a shiny newcomer arrives. Clearly, she wanted to make her feelings felt. And she did, in the baby’s bedroom, while we slept, with an emphatic deposit.</p><p>In the previous weeks, Chelsea had been a&nbsp;shadow of her former self.

<p>The ultimate autumnal soup, made with ancient grains and new season squash</p><p>Barley and, in no particular order, emmer and einkorn, wheat, rice, sorghum, peanuts,<sup> </sup>squash, cassava, lentils, chickpeas, bitter vetch and flax are the so-called founder crops that formed the basis of early agricultural economies in the various centres of domestication all over the planet. My first thought when I read this list of ingredients was: “What a fantastic soup!” And my second was: “What is bitter vetch?” The answer is it’s an ancient legume in the expansive <em>Vicia</em> genus that’s related to broad beans, although physically closer to the lentil and, taste-wise, nearer to a pea, only bitter. So, if you do make the founder crop soup, remember to parboil the bitter vetch several times, changing the water in between, before adding it to the soup. A small, portable oil press is also helpful, if you want to go all the way and turn flax seeds into oil, but remember to warm it gently.

<p>An overlong, overly lightweight tale of Poland’s two-time Olympic champion Jerzy Kulej is saved by a rallying last half hour</p><p>This is a glossily shot but overlong biopic of two-time Olympic gold-winning boxer Jerzy Kulej that tries to position him as a kind of errant bad boy folk hero; a kind of Polish George Best or Diego Maradona. But as it takes place in the late 60s, when Poland wasn’t exactly swinging but very much wanted to, Xawery Żuławski’s film mostly treats him with a weird indulgent levity that over-cranks the performances and neuters the stakes.</p><p>Returning from the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, Kulej (Tomasz Włosok) is a national hero. Under pressure from his wife Helena (Michalina Olszańska) to better their lot, he cuts a deal with his police superior Col Sikorski (Cold War’s Tomasz Kot) for a new apartment in return for becoming a poster boy for the People’s Republic.

Perhaps Tarantino felt some need to offer the audience a formal introduction to the type of low-down genre trash that had always existed outside the mainstream, in lurid dimestore paperbacks or filthy grindhouse theaters. This was not going to be a typical contender for the Palme d’Or at the Cannes film festival, let alone the actual winner.</p><p>Yet there’s a swagger to Pulp Fiction that makes you believe Tarantino, a true moviemaking savant, could see the film’s future laid out in front of hi

You may not like the way they play, some may even call it boring, but they have a bold approach and – so far – they are sticking to it.</p><p>Are they naive? Perhaps.

<p>Coming to terms with my son and his partner’s modern, tender and considered parenting hasn’t been easy – but now I love it</p><p>I was 70 when I became a grandmother for the first time in 2023.

<p>Only a few miles but a world away from overcrowded Snowdon, the quieter paths and rugged slopes of the Rhinogydd offer a walk on the region’s wildest mountain</p><p>As soon as I stepped within the stone circle of Cerrig Arthur, the strange noise began. It came from the far side of the valley – a long, hoarse scream. Then it became louder, growing into an ear-splitting thunder. I jammed my fingers into my ears – but still felt its sonic explosion down in my stomach. The cloud lay low over the stone circle that evening, so it was impossible to tell where the terrible sound was coming from. I might have half-imagined that Cerrig Arthur had unleashed some ancient sorcery, or that this was the return of the legendary king the circle is named for.</p><p>But really, I knew what it was.

Curious about the thinking of men of her generation, the film-maker put out an ad seeking male interview subjects between 30-45, who speak French and are willing to be in front of the camera. As Pernet volleys questions about identity, relationships, and more, the responses form a fascinating tapestry of male experiences, told with candidness and vulnerability.</p><p>One common theme that arises from these tête-à-têtes is a feeling of uncertainty and restlessness. Many of the interviewees are unsure of their place in a world where feminism is more confident and gender relations in France appear to have changed. Antiquated expectations of sex

<p>Her breakout role in the Borat sequel grabbed attention after a scene with Rudy Giuliani on a bed. Now she’s playing Trump’s ex-wife in a controversial biopic – but insists it’s not a political film</p><p>The week Maria Bakalova was asked to consider playing Ivana Trump for the new film The Apprentice, she was in New York filming something else. With the meeting scheduled for her one day off, she spent the evening before trying to channel Donald Trump’s first wife. The film is set in the 70s and 80s, so she spent hours wading through photos of Ivana in that era. “A lot of makeup, a lot of hair,” she says. Bakalova laughs as she remembers spending the evening experimenting with a mushroom-like hairstyle and “heavy eyeliner with a lot of powder, like inches”, although she didn’t have an Ivana-esque wardrobe – “Am I gen Z or a millennial?” asks the 28-year-old. Either way, “We wear a lot of baggy clothes”, so she chose her most skintight outfit.</p><p>She met the director Ali Abbasi i

<p>She’s the far-right prime minister with whom leaders across Europe seem to love being photographed. What’s her appeal and what does she really want? With <strong>Alexander Stille</strong></p><p>From Keir Starmer to Volodymyr Zelenskyy, every European leader seems keen to have their picture taken with Italy’s Giorgia Meloni. Yet she is the country’s first far right prime minister since the second world war and when she was elected she was talked of as a danger to Europe.</p><p><strong>Alexander Stille</strong>, a former editor of Italy’s Corriere della Sera newspaper and now a professor of journalism at Columbia University, has been watching her rise. He looks at the influences that have shaped her – from her romance novelist mother to her time in the government of a previous controversial Italian prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi. And, most surprisingly of all, JRR Tolkein’s Lord of the Rings books.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2024/oct/14/how-giorgia-meloni-
