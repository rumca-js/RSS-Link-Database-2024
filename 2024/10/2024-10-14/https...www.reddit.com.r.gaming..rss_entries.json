From the fact you need to grind to complete quests, unclear quests, seasonal events that aren&#39;t rewarding casual players and frustrating Raids that you just go blind without clear indication. And the loot you find that is just worst than what you already have equipped. </p> <p>I love to lore, the people I&#39;ve played with, but I&#39;m looking for a more relaxed experience.</p> <p>I&#39;m looking for your suggestions for games that: - Rewards you by playing. - Challenging, but not grindy content. - You have equal chances if you play 10h or 100h. - No season pass, no fomo functionalities. - A great lore/story. - Coop/multiplayers.</p> <p>Any suggestions?</p> <p>Thank you very much.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.r", "id": 1319417, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1g392md/online_games_that_respect_your_time", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 492, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Online games that respect your time?", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-10-14T03:19:56+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I miss the good old days with Crab Game and Battlebit Remastered.
