<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I&#39;m just curious what everyone&#39;s favorite soundtrack is or radio stations for games that are gta or gta esque in their design. Because we all have different preferences for music and games be it the genre of either or just the feel of them as well.</p> <p>Personally I like the soundtrack for hades but God of the underworld is probably my favorite. Radio station wise I might get some negative opinions for this hot take but gta 4 base game&#39;s radio was trash so I always had it of but the bogt/lad dlcs added decent songs so when I&#39;m driving though the dlcs I&#39;m usually on the classic rock station. Currently I got into cyberpunk and really the only station I constantly listen to in that is growlr. Fallout new Vegas is usually radio new Vegas and I&#39;m sorry but Johnny guitar is a great song. Although the mysterious broadcast station in owb is pretty great for jazz music. And gta 5 the only station I found somewhat decent was the pop
