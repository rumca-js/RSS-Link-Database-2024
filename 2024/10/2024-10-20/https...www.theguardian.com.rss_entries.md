<p>The courage with which he faces his diagnosis is typical of a man who engages with life in his own way, with perspective</p><p>At a certain age, joked Sir Chris Hoy in October 2011, you don’t even buy green bananas. The throwaway remark was intended to underline the complexities and unpredictabilities of being a “senior” athlete – Hoy was then 35, seemingly blessed with eternal youth – but it seems grimly apposite in the light of the Scot’s announcement that he has terminal cancer and may have only between two and four years to live.</p><p>There has been universal warmth and admiration for the way that Hoy has dealt with his diagnosis, revealed publicly in an interview with the Sunday Times. An upcoming memoir, All That Matters, will go into further detail, along with relating Hoy’s wife Sarra’s diagnosis with multiple sclerosis. The unflinching courage shown by Hoy, the acknowledgement of the tremendous difficulty of processing and communicating what has happened to their family,

Pacino was shooting a wedding scene with the actor Simonetta Stefanelli, and at one point director Francis Ford Coppola asked him to speak to the local people who were forming part of the background. But none of these extras understood English, and Pacino, despite growing up in an Italian household in New York, didn’t quite speak the language of his grandparents. Later, Coppola asked the bride and the groom to dance a waltz together, but Pacino again pleaded incompetence. Towards the end of the scene, the couple were supposed to drive away in a car, but Pacino, ever the New Yorker, didn’t know how to drive. It was at this moment that Coppola ran out of patience with his male lea

The horses, which serve in the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment guarding the king, were on their daily morning exercises near Buckingham Palace when loud noises from a building site caused them to bolt and rampage through the capital for more than two hours. Six people were hospitalised with minor injuries, but all the horses survived in what seemed a once-in-a-lifetime event. Then, on 1 July, it happened <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-

Here, an irascible, obstinate woman of 90 trades stories with a 66-year-old writer who has recently settled, along with her ex-husband, in the small Maine town of Crosby. Nearly always concerning locals past and present, the tales meander, hopping between generations, and both teller and listener often puzzle and disagree over what meaning they might yield, if any. As Olive Kitteridge and Lucy Barton feel their way towards a tentative friendship, even the town’s more lurid events – an elderly woman goes missing and her oddball son is suspected of her murder – are absorbed into the gentle pace of their conversations.</p><p>And

<p>The biographer and historian worships at the altar of the German writer and his magnum opus in an ambitious book that ties itself in knots</p><p>In his 20s, AN Wilson was briefly a candidate for the priesthood. The Anglican God let him down back then, and he has spent the subsequent five decades auditioning substitutes. He now seems to have decided that a deity worthy of worship must be resident in our world rather than afloat above it, and he has therefore erected an altar to Goethe, the sage who “held the German soul in his hands”, established the country’s cultural pre-eminence, and incidentally possessed “the most interesting brain which ever inhabited a human skull”.</p><p>Wilson identifies the omniscient Goethe with the hero of <em>Faust</em>, the unstageable poetic drama that was his “whole-life masterpiece”, successively extended and reconceived between 1772 and 1831. In this “philosophical oratorio”, Faust begins as a rebel against Christianity but ends by superseding all

<p><strong>Park theatre, London<br></strong>It is a treat to see this kaleidoscopic meditation on stories and the nature of time brought to the stage, even if at times the play struggles to hold the full weight of its ideas</p><p>What a treat, years after reading the book, to finally go for a walk with Daniel Gluck. This is a man who talks of words as things that grow and of the world as something to be read, who throws a watch into a canal to demonstrate how time flies. Ever curious and easily delighted, Gary Lilburn’s twinkling performance as the cheeky old storyteller is the beating heart of Harry McDonald’s new stage adaptation of Ali Smith’s novel Autumn.</p><p>An uneven patchwork of a play, this intimate new production seeks kindness and care in our too-often apathetic world. With Daniel asleep in a care home for most of the play, the story is told in jumbled flashbacks as 11-year-old Elisabeth (a wide-eyed, forthright Rebecca Banatvala) shyly meets her old neighbour and quickly

<p><strong>Birmingham Rep<br></strong>Terry Ronald’s true-life tale of a bullied gay teenager who prevails in the school production of Oliver! is performed with affecting verve</p><p>Today, Terry Ronald is a successful writer, songwriter and producer (working with the likes of Kylie Minogue and Sheena Easton). Back in 1979, though, he was a bullied gay teenager at a south London secondary school. When he was invited to play the role of Nancy in the school production of <em>Oliver!</em>, he bottled the challenge. The thought of the ratcheting up of “the verbal abuse and the taunting” he was already enduring was too scary. The poppy, feelgood musical <em><a href="https://www.birmingham-rep.co.uk/whats-on/becoming-nancy/">Becoming Nancy</a></em> is based on Ronald’s “deliciously camp” 2012 <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/becoming-nancy-9780552162944/">coming-of-age novel</a>, in which he imagines what might have happened if he had said “Yes”.</p><p>Positivity radiates from the stag

<p>The Tory leadership contender’s assertion that the last book he read was A Tale of Two Cities is open to several interpretations</p><p>Last weekend, in answer to the question “What was the last book you read?”, Tory leadership contender Robert Jenrick said <em>A Tale of Two Cities</em>. Lots to unpack there. First, some context: it was in the “quickfire questions” section of an interview in the <em>Daily Mail</em>, among the readers of which there may be one or two members of the Conservative party. Possibly even more. So, as a politics professional, Jenrick will have been focused on coming across well to them.</p><p>It’s tricky for him, though, because that’s not the same thing as coming across well in general. It’s not the wider public he’s courting. Nor even Tory voters. No, he has to appeal to a constituency of people who make those who merely vote Conservative seem like hand-wringing woke hipsters.

<p>Their magic touch with our offspring extended to charming our friends and acquaintances – again</p><p>Having left our children with nana and grandad for three days, the inevitable came to pass. Not only did they go to sleep for them immediately, they remained in their beds throughout two of the three nights, a record we have not achieved in the past six months. There were no tantrums, and our 14-step contingency plan for emergencies relating to bone breakage, kidnapping, fire or flood went thankfully unused. They even remembered how house keys worked throughout this period, doubtless thankful of the reminders I’d given them before we left.</p><p>Looking at these updates as they came to us in Ireland, I did feel that mild twinge of annoyance you get when your children behave better for others than yourself, but was overjoyed that we could enjoy Sarah and George’s beautiful wedding without fear of returning to a pile of charred rubble, or a pair of grim-faced in-laws intent on faking

<p>Labour nerves are jangling in advance of the most significant event since the election</p><p>I have now heard so many Labour people quiver that Rachel Reeves’ looming budget is a “make or break” event that I’ve given up counting. Whether or not it will deserve such hyperbolic billing, it is certainly true that the first Labour budget in 14 years is the most significant moment since the election, both for the chancellor’s reputation and the standing of the government as a whole. When Ms Reeves gets up before the Commons on 30 October, she will do so accompanied by a great weight of expectation.</p><p>“It’s massive,” says one member of the cabinet. “Hugely important,” agrees another. “It sets the course for the rest of the parliament.” A third senior minister describes it as “a milestone budget” with “several big jobs to do”.

<p>The Succession star chills as US lawyer Roy Cohn opposite Sebastian Stan as his grasping protege Donald Trump in Ali Abbasi’s intriguing drama</p><p>It’s not quite an ultra-villain origin story. But nor is Iranian-Danish director Ali Abbasi’s <em>The Apprentice</em> in any way a flattering depiction of its subject, the young(ish) Donald Trump (a horribly convincing Sebastian Stan). The film follows Trump’s early journey, starting as “Little Donnie”, the browbeaten second son of an overbearing father who scoffs that his boy “needs all the help he can get”.

These people are journalists. Specifically, music journalists, who possess the pedantic instinct of all journalists to get the facts right, but also, because they write about pop music, have a competing desire to be romantic. To mythologise. To make people and events and songs and whole entire years seem more flamboyant, more life-changing and revolutionary than they actually were.</p><p>The people who <em>don’t</em> argue about it are the fans and the musicians.

Even after stripping out the numbers of excess deaths during Covid, there were an estimated 16,300 fewer births than deaths in the year to mid-2023, the first time this has happened since the 1970s. A recent <em>Lancet</em> study suggests the world population will fall within decades, for the first time since the Black Death.

<p>The raw intensity and personal honesty that Richard E Grant brought to <em>Withnail and I</em> was real and has never left him. Now the actor and diarist, still grieving the loss of his wife, talks openly about heartbreak, ambition and his traumatic upbringing</p><p>A month before she died, the acclaimed dialect coach Joan Washington recorded a poem to be played on her daughter’s wedding day. Washington died on 2 September 2021 from lung cancer, concluding a 38-year marriage to the actor and diarist Richard E Grant. Olivia, the couple’s daughter, celebrated her marriage this past September at the house Grant and Washington shared in London. Grant wore an elegant tuxedo, his blue eyes startling, and the house was swollen with flowers. His speech included “all the things a father says. You want it to be as humorous and as heartfelt as possible, in that combination, so people aren’t stabbing themselves with their forks.” But the family couldn’t bring themselves to play Washington’s re

<p>From his 12th-floor apartment, the Hungarian photographer captured many of his defining pictures for more than 30 years</p><p>The photographer André Kertész chose his New York apartment carefully. Born in Hungary in 1894, Kertész served in the first world war, and lived and worked in Paris until 1936 when, with the Nazi threat spreading across Europe, he and his wife Elizabeth exiled themselves to the States. He brought with him many ideas from friends in the French avant garde who had included Man Ray and Piet Mondrian – in particular a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2017/nov/02/andre-kerteszs-everyday-poetry-mirroring-life">revolutionary understanding of composition</a>, of the cubist possibilities of light and shade.

My family was very religious, so every Sunday I’d have to put on my Sunday best. Church is the foundation stone for who I am. It teaches the importance of belief. It puts standards in place that I’ve maintained my whole life.</p><p><strong>Sundays now?</strong> The biggest change is when you start taking responsibility for a family and split your energies. My message to everybody is this: you are the most important person, you need to remember to look after you. But try telling that to a mother who has children.

An encounter with Hirst was something approached with trepidation: there were reports of ‘challenging’ behaviour; he had filled a <em>Sunday Times</em> interviewer’s handbag with flies; there had been some ‘unpleasantness’ involving a rat, a rubber glove and an art critic. Brian Sewell advised against shaking his hand: ‘limp, damp and unpleasant’.</p><p>But there was no unpleasantness; just Hirst’s trademark blend of ‘charm and confrontation’ as he explained the philosophy behind the headlines.

The basic recipe goes a little like this: white grapes are first picked and pressed, and then the clear juice is separated from the skins before being fermented in chilled stainless-steel tanks after the winemaker has added some yeast. The wine is then stored in larger tanks before being bottled and sold the following spring. There are plenty of delightful wines produced in this way, but, as I’ve made my way round the various supermarkets’ press tastings over the past couple of months, it’s been good to see a few more recent variations. The latest addition to M&amp;S’s adventurous Found range, for example, not only includes a rare Valencian grape variety (verdil), but the juice sits for two to three w
