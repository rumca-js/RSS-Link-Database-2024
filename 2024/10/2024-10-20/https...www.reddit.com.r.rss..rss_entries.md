<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>A major reason I use RSS is to stay updated and read about tech, particularly Apple-related content, since that’s what I mainly use but also like to read about tech in general.</p> <p>I’m not really interested in the broader coverage you get from sites like The Verge, where they many times write about stuff I’m not interested in at all. Their feed can get overwhelming, even after trying to follow specific categories and filtering content using Feedbin. I’ve had a similar experience with 9to5Mac, where many headlines feel like clickbait.</p> <p>I’m looking for alternative sources that cover similar Apple &amp; tech-focused topics but with less frequent updates.</p> <p>Any recommendations would be appreciated!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Ill_Connection_3017"> /u/Ill_Connection_3017 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1g7vt52/best_alternatives_to_the_verge_and_9to5mac/
