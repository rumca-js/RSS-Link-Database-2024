Experts share their tips for speaking out, socialising and leaving timidity behind</p><p>When Laura, 34, was growing up in a genteel neighbourhood in Edinburgh, her parents taught her that the worst thing a person could do was make a show of themselves. “By that, they meant wearing bright colours, laughing or talking loudly; doing anything at all to attract attention.”</p><p>Although she deplored their attitude, Laura finds she has inherited their mindset. “The other Sunday, I had to have a difficult conversation with a neighbour about their incessantly barking dog. They ended up shouting at me and I wanted the earth to swallow me up. There were other people around and I’m sure they were all wondering what I had done to create this scene.

<p>The industrial building, originally used to make charcoal, has been minimally restored and adapted into a stunning home</p><p>Approaching Stuart Grannen’s home is an experience in itself, marked by the unexpected. Tucked down an unremarkable alley in the industrial heart of Chicago, this 1900s former charcoal factory stands in quiet contrast to its surroundings. Draped in creeping ivy and raw steel, the concrete structure, hidden in plain sight, exudes an original and raw kind of charm. It’s an urban sanctuary that, from the outside, gives little away. But as you pass through the motorised roll-up door and step inside, a whole new world unfolds – a world crafted with intention, history and a deep respect and love for imperfection.</p><p>Grannen, globally known as one of the foremost dealers in architectural artefacts, has spent decades amassing a collection of antiques and rare objects that stretch across continents and centuries.

<p>Push and pull for public opinion between lawyers and rugby authorities rumbles on but where would we be if no one had taken action in the first place?</p><p>Four years ago, just after the Guardian had first reported that a group of eight rugby union players had been diagnosed with early onset dementia and were <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/dec/08/steve-thompson-former-rugby-union-players-dementia-landmark-legal-case">planning legal action against the game’s governing bodies</a>, I sat down to a three-way interview with the former Wales international Alix Popham and the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/mar/29/they-are-going-to-come-after-you-a-doctors-advice-on-rugbys-battle-over-brain-injuries">forensic pathologist Bennet Omalu</a>.

<p>Perhaps for the first time under Brendon McCullum, belief slightly drained away during moonshot run chase in Multan</p><p>It was a pretty good week for fans outside of cricket’s so-called Big Three. In Dubai, West Indies sent England tumbling out of the Women’s T20 World Cup, then South Africa produced a remarkable demolition job on Australia and now meet New Zealand in Sunday’s final. In Bangalore, New Zealand’s men rolled India for a marmalade-dropping 46 all out, their lowest total in a home Test.<br><br>
 And in Multan, on a pitch refurbished in between Tests with the use of giant fans at either end, Pakistan secured a restorative victory over England - their first in 12 matches at home to set up a tantalising series decider in Rawalpindi next week.</p><p>All it took was dropping three poster boys, recalling two wily old spinners in Noman Ali and Sajid Khan, and Shan Masood winning the toss on this surface of diminishing returns. It was a gamble, no question, but still required
