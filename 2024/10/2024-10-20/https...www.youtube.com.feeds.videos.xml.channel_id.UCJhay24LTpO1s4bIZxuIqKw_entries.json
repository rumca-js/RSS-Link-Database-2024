Let's take a step back and look at something completely different: nature inspired swarm algorithms.\nWe'll discover how to implement algorithms using (virtual) ants, bees and other animals to solve problems. Each approach appears to give rise to swarm intelligence, and provides a good basis for learning how other AI algorithms work.\n\nSlides: https://accu.org/conf-previous/accu2024/\nSponsored By think-cell\n---\n\nFrances Buontempo\n\nFrances Buontempo is currently editor of the ACCU\u2019s Overload magazine, has written a book on Genetic Algorithms and Machine Learning, and a C++ book to help you catch up since C++11.
