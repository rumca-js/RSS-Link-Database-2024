The Veilguard opts for a far more colorful art style, sporting neon purples and cartoony characters, but it keeps the great character dynamics from classic Bioware systems intact. \n\nThe Lighthouse, for example, serves as the main hub where each party member decorates their abode and furthers their bond with the main character, named Rook.

You can still pause combat with the skill wheel and order party commands and initiate combos, but the game delivers a smooth un-interrupted combat.
