## Search engine that respects quotes and only searches in visible text

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Basically the title. I use Google, and has been a long time it does not respect the quotes (especially around a single word). I&#39;ve read that sometimes (most?) this happens because the word is on some meta in the page, so it is not visible and most of the time SEO just put it there for better rank. So is there an option on Google, or other search engine that I can search &quot;word&quot; and only if it is visible, and on the search results I can always see the &quot;word&quot; and the context around it?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/boimate"> /u/boimate </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/searchengines/comments/1g7vs9h/search_engine_that_respects_quotes_and_only/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/searchengines/comments/1g7vs9h/search_engine_that_respects_quotes_and_only/">[comments]</a></span>
