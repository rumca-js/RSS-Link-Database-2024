A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead might cater to fans of the movies, from the reference to Day One or the homage to the first film's ending.

However, if anything, it'll only make you appreciate those titles much more.

Dragon Age: The Veilguard is Bioware’s 4th game in the dark fantasy series and releases on October 31st after a decade since its last entry. The Veilguard opts for a far more colorful art style, sporting neon purples and cartoony characters, but it keeps the great character dynamics from classic Bioware systems intact. 

The Lighthouse, for example, serves as the main hub where each party member decorates their abode and furthers their bond with the main character, named Rook. Your decisions impact character dynamics and follow through in gameplay through special party member abilities and combos. 

Speaking of combos, the combat in The Veilguard is more fast-paced and seamless than ever. You can still pause combat with the skill wheel and order party commands and initiate combos, but the game delivers a smooth un-interrupted combat. We’ll see how well The Veilguard honors the classic Bioware series when it comes out late October.
