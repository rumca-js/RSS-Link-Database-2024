The website has been setup a year ago at a hosting provider that uses cPanel and it has worked perfectly, but a few days ago something broke and now no one is able to upload any file larger than 125kB or groups of files, whose size is bigger than 125kB through the website. When someone tries to upload files larger than that, the page just simply loads till infinity without actually making any progress or creating the file on the disc. It&#39;s also important to not that when I tried to upload a file larger than 125kB in the Django admin panel and I left some fields empty, which can&#39;t be null, the infinite loading still happened, so it seems, that the problem is caused before the form validation takes place.

But then I ran `python <a href=\"http://manage.py\">manage.py</a> runserver` and this caused all kinds of errors. </p> <p>So I decided it was for the best to clone my project from my remote repo on Github and start all over with DRF.
