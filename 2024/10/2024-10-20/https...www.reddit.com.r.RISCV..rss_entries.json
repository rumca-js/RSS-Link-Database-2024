It comes in a nice slim box, with tablet, SIM/SD card release pin, and an SD Card with original OS images. I&#39;m not using a SIM, but I did add an SD Card. This is the 8 GB RAM/128 GB storage model. I also opted to get a keyboard with fold out stand, and with a tablet this size, it works better with the tablet in landscape mode.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/John_from_ne_il\"> /u/John_from_ne_il </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1g86lo9\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1g86lo9/dc_roma_pad_ii_impressions/\">[", "id": 1358228, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1g86lo9/dc_roma_pad_ii_impressions", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 471, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/yiM3ADLPlB0zfCVV1Y-EgXHZbicXDYmYSckQKHVUHXY.jpg", "title": "DC Roma Pad II Impressions", "vote": 0}]
