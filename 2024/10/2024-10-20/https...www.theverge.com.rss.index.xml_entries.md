  <p id="kfcPpp">Tech billionaire Elon Musk <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg78ljxn8g7o">gave a $1 million check</a> to an audience member at a rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, where he’s been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/16/24271770/elon-musk-trump-pennsylvania-talks">Trump-stumping</a>, on Saturday. And he said he will continue to give that prize to one random voter per day until the Presidential election on November 5th. The move could very well break US election law.</p>

  <p id="JxXdQG">It’s time to dust off your VCR and clean the heads, because <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/14/24219417/alien-romulus-review"><em>Alien: Romulus</em></a> is coming to VHS as a limited edition on December 3rd alongside the other physical releases, director Fede Alvarez announced during “a special <a href="https://beyondfest.com/">Beyond Fest</a>-partnered screening” in Los Angeles yesterday. </p>
<p id="PATpiw">The “fully functioning VHS tape” is meant to celebrate 45 years since the <em>Alien</em> franchise first (chest) burst into theaters, 20th Century Studios wrote in a release emailed to <em>The Verge</em>. It’ll present the movie, appropriately, in a 4:3 aspect ratio (hopefully without pan-and-scan). It also comes in a slick

  <p id="4uHUPV">For many a year, Windows users have been dragging their program windows over to the borders of the screen to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22710511/windows-11-snap-layouts-how-to">snap them into position</a>, splitting the screen up evenly into halves or quarters. Now, with the rollout of macOS Sequoia, Mac users can do the same. You can get a Spotify playlist up alongside your email inbox, for example, or a report you’re writing up alongside the online articles you’re reporting on. It means less switching between windows and more information on the screen.</p>

  <p id="JdxDCe">For the last eight months, David Cogen has been living a double life. By day: a YouTuber and creator, the face of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TheUnlockr/videos">TheUnlockr</a>, reviewing phones and testing ebikes and explaining how food smokers really work. By night and morning and every single other available moment in between: a coffee shop entrepreneur, working to get a Brooklyn spot called Coffee Check up and running. The whole thing started late last year and escalated quickly. He needed a new workspace after his previous lease ended, had a business idea for it that didn’t quite pan out, decided to repu
