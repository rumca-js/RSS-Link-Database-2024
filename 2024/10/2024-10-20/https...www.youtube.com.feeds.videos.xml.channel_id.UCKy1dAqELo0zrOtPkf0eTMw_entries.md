In Starless Abyss you command a fleet of ships and plow through the space horrors. Successful missions reward you with new artifacts to upgrade your ships, D.I.C.E to help sway pivotal moments between missions or cards from different factions, which can be collected, combined, and combo-ed to help destroy the eldritch beasts. 

But the closer you get to the Outer Gods, the more your sanity depletes. You can try to fight it off... or just embrace the insanity and harness the power of the occult, utilizing ridiculously overpowered Ritual Cards. Try not to go too mad out there, yeah?
Starless Abyss will launch in 2025 on Steam.
