An Introduction to Swarm Intelligence Algorithms - (Swarm Your Way Out of a Paper Bag) - Frances Buontempo - ACCU 2024
---

AI is a huge topic and most people are talking about LLMs at the moment. Let's take a step back and look at something completely different: nature inspired swarm algorithms.
We'll discover how to implement algorithms using (virtual) ants, bees and other animals to solve problems. Each approach appears to give rise to swarm intelligence, and provides a good basis for learning how other AI algorithms work.
