## Is my table missing something with Hoax?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Played a 5-person game of Hoax tonight and found the game convoluted and slow. The discussion and voting after calling &#39;hoax&#39; on someone didn&#39;t seem important when the rules explicitly forbid you from naming cards that you have seen. Why do I need to persuade other players? What incentive do they have to vote against? It seemed that investigating didn&#39;t pin the other player enough to threaten an accusation.</p> <p>I like the concept a lot; I&#39;m just wondering how others play the game and if there&#39;s something my group didn&#39;t grasp the first go-round.</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/sketchmcawesome"> /u/sketchmcawesome </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1g8c2pm/is_my_table_missing_something_with_hoax/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1g8c2pm/is_my_table_missing_something_

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I recently discovered that my favorite board games (outside of 5e) are Quarriors and Glow. These have in common a mechanic where you&#39;re ideally building up your team with bigger and better abilities as time goes on. Unfortunately when I Google any variation of crew/squad building I get every article related to board games that are good for team building exercises IRL. Any other games like those or Doomlings out there?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/bazmonsta"> /u/bazmonsta </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1g7xxrl/crew_building_games/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1g7xxrl/crew_building_games/">[comments]</a></span>

They both enjoyed being the baddies as I played the greedy Pilot on her way through the first chapter of the Campaign.</p> <p>Overall, we enjoyed the mechanics and the environment. Tossing the Dead Space soundtrack fit very well, and it was a good game to play during the spooky season hehe. I think we&#39;ll be picking it back up very soon now that we get the rules more clearly. I can see some great potential for doing a nice narrative semi roleplay from the side of the Evil Players.</p> <p>I am a little confused about what happens if a character is defeated

I am crazy for Suppressed memories (I already have Recurring Nightmares), is there a way to find it cheaper?</p> <p>As I really want RN and SM, I heard it&#39;s essentially the content from the first edition. Would it work to buy the first edition and use that instead as a replacement, or are the pieces too different? I was literally bidding on one (main, and the two expansions) and I went for ¬£160, which I already assumed was quite a lot...it sold for ¬£240! That is an insane amount of money. Any tips on getting the expansions or working around it?</p> <p>Any other similar games you&#39;d recommend?
