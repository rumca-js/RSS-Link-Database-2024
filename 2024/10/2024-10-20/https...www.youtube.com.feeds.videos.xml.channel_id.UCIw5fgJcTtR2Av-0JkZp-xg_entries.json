Volca Keys is playing a single drone note, and is connected to K.O.II via sync (sync out on K.O.II with 8ths sync into Volca sync in). It's not entirely necessary as I wasn't using any motion sequencing (I could have, to make it even more textured and interesting). I wish I could have sent MIDI out to the volca as well as the Ottobit Jr at the same time, but I don't have a simple solution that doesn't require some big MIDI hub, lots of cables and extra power requirements. Maybe I'll figure something out - perhaps a headphone splitter might work? \nThe output from the Ottobit Jr is sent to the input of the K.O.II, with a reverb effect from the K.O.II turned up about 50%. There are only two scenes used with this jam, one with the snares and extra hats, and the opening one without. The bassline remains the same on both scenes.
