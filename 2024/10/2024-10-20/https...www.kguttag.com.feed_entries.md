Introduction The general premise of my last article, Meta Orion AR (Pt. 2 Orion vs Wave Optics/Snap and Magic Leap Waveguides), is that Meta Orion is using similar waveguide technology to Snap (Wave Optics) and that Magic Leap Two (ML2) is correct. However, several comments and assumptions about the specifics of waveguides with a diffraction grating on both sides [&#8230;]
