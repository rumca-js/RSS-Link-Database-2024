<p class="has-drop-cap has-text-align-none"><em>Japanese Rural Life Adventure</em> is what it says on the tin — it’s a 16-bit-style farming sim that takes place in the countryside, and it’s filled with hallmarks of the genre: You leave the city to arrive at a broken-down farm that you revitalize as you meet the townsfolk and become a part of their community.
