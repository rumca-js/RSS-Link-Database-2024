Its a good viewing angle where you can see all the action from the audience perspective. I learned a lot of other useful things from this experiment and enjoyed playing Animusics crazy song swell :) Enjoy!\n\nOriginal Song: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9X33k4TMmM\n\nSupport Wintergatan:\n- Patreon \u25ba https://patreon.com/Wintergatan\n- Youtube membership \u25ba https://bit.ly/4cQVM7C\n\nMarble Machine Engineering Discord Server:\nhttps://discord.com/invite/7aSFJA6bkH\n\nVideo edited By Martin and Hannes from the Trainerds YouTube Channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/TRAINERDS\n\n\u2014\nPATREON \u25ba https://patreon.com/Wintergatan\nYOUTUBE MEMBERSHIP \u25ba https://bi", "id": 1335571, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMgVt3OJbrU", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 393, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCcXhhVwCT6_WqjkEniejRJQ", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/QMgVt3OJbrU/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Future Retro - Animusic Cover With Marbles", "vote": 0}]
