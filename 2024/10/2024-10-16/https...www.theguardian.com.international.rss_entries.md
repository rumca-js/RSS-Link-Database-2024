I started growing them at home last year, and often brought them into work for the kitchen team to experiment with. There’s usually a sigh whenever I interrupt morning prep in this way, but it often turns into one of joy, because the chance to work with an ingredient that’s truly seasonal invariably gets the creative juices going. There’s a wide array of pumpkin varieties out there, all with slight flavour differences that are brought to life by roasting or charring (when pumpkin isn’t available, squash will happily act as a substitute). These two dishes showcase the versatility of this underrated vegetable, and provide an insight into how we get the most out of them in a restaurant kitchen.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food

<p>This modern twist on the 1877 novel is an inspirational look at African American horse culture. Shame it’s also saccharine, shallow and full of flat dialogue</p><p>As the Paris Olympics drew to a close this year, thousands of plans formed on social media, with those who could barely run a mile wondering what would be their best shot at getting into the Olympic village in four years’ time. Breakdancing didn’t look too hard; perhaps air-rifle shooting? But the consensus seemed to be that the dream gig was equestrianism, where the fancy horses do most of the work and the medallists are all heiresses, aristocrats or children of rock legends. You&nbsp;would just have to win the lottery first.</p><p>Unfortunately for the budding Olympian Jolie Dumont (Kaya Coleman) in Prime Video’s drama Beyond Black Beauty, she is experiencing a reversal of&nbsp;fortune. Her opulent life in Belgium, complete with a&nbsp;gorgeous top-tier horse, comes to an abrupt end when her parents split and her mothe

<p>Frequented by those looking for a refuge from homophobia, this documentary charts the history of the venue and the effort to save its cultural legacy</p><p>‘It used to be paradise. Now it’s a straight club.” The dismay is obvious when a bunch of former regulars at Studio One, the legendary West Hollywood gay club, take a tour of the venue in 2019. From 1974 until 1993, 9pm to 2am, seven nights a week, men packed the dancefloor of Studio One. “It was the happiest place on Earth,” remembers one. Looking at the photographs you can almost smell the sweat. One ex employee says that so many guys were taking poppers you could get a head-rush high simply by breathing in on the dance floor.</p><p>The story of Studio One is told in this affectionate, nostalgic documentary. Film-maker Marc Saltarelli interviews men who were there and follows a campaign in 2019 to save the Studio One building – a former factory – from demolition. When it opened in 1974, homophobia was rife outside. Studio One

<p>I was in a friend’s fifth-floor flat when the place went up in flames. Suddenly I understood my mortality and what I was prepared to do to save myself</p><p></p><p>When my friend<strong> </strong>Jonathan heard the crash of breaking glass that night in 2008, he thought it was drunks flinging bottles on Leith Walk in Edinburgh. They did that a lot, although they must have been rowdier than usual, as it was loud. It took him a few minutes to understand what was actually happening – and in that time the stairwell to his fifth-floor flat became entirely impassable. That crash was the sound of the downstairs windows exploding – glass shattering under the obscene heat of the burning apartment below us.</p><p>As for me, I was sitting with Jonathan’s wife, Ericka, in the other room, distracted by wine and chatting nonsense. The first I knew anything was wrong was when Jonathan appeared in the doorway. “I don’t mean to worry you,” he said. “But we need to go.” I flapped around, trying to lo
