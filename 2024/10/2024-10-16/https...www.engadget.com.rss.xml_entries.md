The most notable update is the introduction of Business Caller ID. When this feature rolls out next year, companies of any size can register to have their name, logo and department appear when they contact customers. In practice, that can help people distinguish between a phone call from a legitimate business and spam.</p>
<p>Apple Business Connect allows companies to have more control over how they appear within different apps across the Apple ecosystem. In 2023, Apple <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1"

<p>Airline travel can get expensive and sometimes you don’t wanna wade through various options to find the lowest price. You just need the cheapest flight available and you don’t care who’s offering it.</p>
<p>Google added the tab to its Flights search engine that will cut your flight schedule search to the chase and just show you the “cheapest” options available, according to <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://blog.google/products/search/google-flights-cheapest-tab/"><ins>the official blog</ins></a>.

<p><em>Hades II</em> <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://twitter.com/SupergiantGames/status/1846601374555164744">just got its first major update</a>, which is all the reason I need to jump back into the inspired roguelite. Supergiant Games is calling the Olympic Update “practically mountain-sized”, likely because there’s a new region set in the mountains of Olympus.</p>
<p>With a new region, comes new story elements. The studio says “hours of new dialogue” has been added to the game. The area will also feature two new allies, but Supergiant remains mum on their identities. In other words, you’ll have to traverse Olympus to find out. I’d bet some Obol Points that they are Greek Gods of one type or another, given the region.</p>

<p>Panos Panay has a Diet Coke problem. It’s a topic that quickly came up when I walked into the small interview room, after he offered me a choice of beverages and I said my partner has a similar addiction. After a quick conversation on the advantages of drinking plain water over diet colas, I knew his wife, like me, advocates for less soda, but I still knew nothing of how much the man actually consumed a day.</p>

<p>Seventeen years is an odd anniversary to call out. But at an event launching four new Kindles, Amazon’s head of devices and services Panos Panay reminded a group of media that “Kindle is 17 years in the making, almost to the day.” Panay added that the device is currently seeing its highest sales numbers, and that 20.8 billion pages are read each month on a Kindle. But people aren’t just reading on Kindles. Since the introduction of the Kindle Scribe in 2022, there has been even more development in e-paper writing tablets, with a notable recent product in <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/remarkable-paper-pro-review-writing-in-color-is-nice-but-itll-cost-you-173024590.html">the reMarkable Paper Pro</a>. While that $580 device supports a color writing experience, Amazon’s Kindle Scribe still only works in black and white. But it might offer enough by way of software updates to make up for its monochrome manner.</p>

One year later, the pair has revealed a <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.axiomspace.com/">first look at the Axiom Extravehicular Mobility Unit</a> (AxEMU) spacesuit during Milan&#39;s International Astronautical Congress. The suit is white with red and gray accents that admittedly does look chicer than a typical spacesuit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The pair claims the new spacesuit&#39;s design improves on flexibility, can manage an eight hour spacewalk and will sustain two hours of the lunar south pole&#39;s coldest temperatures. &quot;Prada’s design and product development team worked alongside Axiom Space engineers on customized material recommendations and

<p>Apple just announced the seventh-gen <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/the-ipad-mini-7-goes-big-on-apple-intelligence-130848482.html">iPad mini,</a> three years after its sixth-gen model. It has a faster A17 Pro chip, originally found in the iPhone 15 Pro, which means it’ll be able to handle Apple’s incoming AI features — although it’s not Apple&#39;s most powerful mobile chip. There’s more RAM too.</p>
<p>Power aside, it has the same 8.3-inch screen as the previous model and an identical 2,266 x 1,488 resolution at 326 ppi. The refresh rate remains a modest 60Hz, in an era of 90Hz or higher. It’s not any bigger, wider or slimmer than its predecessor either.</p>
<p>It’s been a while since a new iPad mini, so we were overdue an update. However, this is a very mild update with no design changes. Also, while the size is smaller, no M-series chip. The new iPad mini arrives on October 23, starting at $499 for 128GB storage. It’ll arrive in blue, p

<p>Fitness trackers are a solid option if you really want to hone in on tracking, well, your fitness. Some of the best fitness trackers also include additional sensors to track things like stress, sleep and other health metrics. Sure, you could opt for the <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-smartwatches-153013118.html">best smartwatch</a>, but if you’re not interested in all of the extra features they offer, a fitness tracker might be a better (and more affordable) option. Accurate workout and activity tracking is what fitness trackers do best; most include a pedometer to track your steps throughout the day. They might not look as glamorous as an <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-apple-watch-160005462.html">Apple Watch</a>, but they do a particular job well. We’ve researched and tested a good selection of the most popular fitness trackers out there to help make your decision a little easier.</p>
