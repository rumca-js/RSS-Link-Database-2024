<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello, I’m currently in school to learn playschool teaching and one of my assignments is to make an educational board game out of recycled material. I’m struggling a bit with coming up with an educational game that is suitable for this age group (a good majority of my kids are bilingual and that adds an extra struggle) and I’ve been looking for inspiration but I’m having no luck finding anything. Any recommendations would be super helpful. Thanks in advance! 🫶</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Tight-Ad4801"> /u/Tight-Ad4801 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1g53mp1/educational_boardgames_for_4_year_olds/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1g53mp1/educational_boardgames_for_4_year_olds/">[comments]</a></span>

## The uniqueness and impact of cards in Dune Imperium

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello! My favorite mechanic is deck building and my favorite game by far is Dune Imperium because I love how impactful and unique each card is. Although it can create swinginess, I love that there are higher cost cards that you can shape your deck/strategy around - cards that when they appear there is an instant tension around who will be able to claim it. All of the cards have unique abilities that behave very differently , whereas some deck builders have cards that mostly just give or convert resources in different ways. I also like that it is a &quot;deckbuilding +&quot; game, with deckbuilding plus a board and some other ways of player interaction. I also like that there are trashing mechanics so that you can see that powerful card more often.</p> <p>So far no other deck building game has beat Dune Imperium for me - Quest for El Dorado is good, I love the race element. Clank is another great one.</p> <p>Are there other games along these lines?</p>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I remember seeing this board game earlier this year, I think it was on a platform like Kickstarter, but I don&#39;t remember. Here are details I remember about the game.</p> <p>The board is made up of different hex tiles that represent a planet surface. Players have to extract resources to build a rocket to escape the planet. As players extract resources there are fractures that appear on the planet, like tiles become lava or something. As the game progresses the board becomes harder to deal with. Some blueprints for the rockets have to be obtained by interacting with other players. I belive there were different units like soldiers and mech suits.</p> <p>Does anybody else remember seeing this game? I believe the name reflected the mechanic of the board becoming unstable. The words fracture and fissure come to mind, but I don&#39;t know how close that is.</p> <p>Please help.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.redd

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>It is surprising to see something so different in Warhammer line. This is not dice chucking ameri game, this is a puzzle - fairly simple but at the same time quite thinky. </p> <p>At first glance Lost Relics looks like your average dungeon crawler, but actually every move is a mini-puzzle: how to use optimally dices which you have rolled, what actions to spend them on and in which order. Order is crucially important, because when dices of one or different heroes are activated sequentially (with values 1, 2, 3, etc.), a chain of actions is created, and enemies react only once after this entire chain, not after each action of each hero. Also damage is deterministic, which makes game even more puzzley, because you know in advance the outcome of all actions and behavior of monsters.</p> <p>Monsters are quite diverse and there are a lot of missions, however there are only 4 heroes, and they have only 1-2 unique skills each.
