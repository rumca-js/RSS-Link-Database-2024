<p>As development continues on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hades-ii/">Hades 2</a>, Supergiant Games has released its first major update for the roguelite adventure. In addition to general fine-tuning and tweaks to the gameplay, the Olympic Update also adds in a ton of new gameplay content, like a new region to explore, a brand-new weapon to master, more characters to meet, new decorations, and best of all, new animal familiars to bond with. On top of that, there's also more artwork to gawk at and new music tracks to listen to, making this a hefty expansion of the game during its early access journey.</p><p>The new location--which we're not spoiling here--will take players to the peak of the Hades 2 world, while the last of the Nocturnal Arms can be unlocked for Melinoe's arsenal. This weapon--another part of the game we're not spoiling--sounds like it'll require quick reflexes to master as Supergiant teased that players will be able to guard and retaliate with powerful att

This only seems to work for consoles, and the rules will be different for PlayStation and Xbox. PC users might be out of luck unless they have some VPN method to relocate them to New Zealand, but this is usually a console only trick.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1846220799264301065">CharlieIntel</a> believes this method should work again this year, but it's worth noting that the process for PlayStation users might be way more hassle than it's worth, as it requires you

<p>Analogue has lifted the veil on its modernized Nintendo 64 console. Originally teased last year--exactly one year ago today, in fact--the Analogue 3D plays N64 game cartridges in 4K resolution. Like other Analogue devices, the 3D was built using FPGA to provide an authentic N64 experience while also allowing users to enjoy the benefits of playing on modern displays. It even supports all of the original accessories. But if you want to cut the cord and ditch the three-prong N64 controller, Analogue collaborated with 8BitDo on a new-style controller that looks quite lovely.</p><p>The Analogue 3D is designed to offer the "the essence of CRT" on a 4K TV. You can cycle through various display modes made to reproduce the effect of an old-school television set. There'll be two models available--one in white and the other in black--and the Analogue 3D is priced at $250. Preorders will begin on <strong>October 21 at 8 AM PT</strong>, and if the initial preorder window is anything like other

With the persona, he captured the WWE Universal Championship twice, but quickly disappeared from television and was subsequently released in 2021.

<p>The eccentric inventor Wallace and his faithful beagle, Gromit, are back again for one of their wild stop-motion adventures. Wallace and Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl will be the sixth Wallace and Gromit film, the first since 2008's A Matter of Loaf and Death, and their second feature-length film following the Oscar-winning The Curse of the Were-Rabbit in 2005. Vengeance Most Fowl was announced back in 2022 and we finally have our first trailer.</p><p>"Gromit's concern that Wallace is becoming too dependent on his inventions proves justified when Wallace invents a 'smart gnome' that seems to develop an evil mind of its own," the film's official synopsis reads. "When it emerges that a vengeful figure from the past might be masterminding things, it falls to Gromit to battle sinister forces and save his master…or Wallace may never be able to invent again!" Check out the duo's latest hijinks and a return of an old adversary.</p><div data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.c

<p dir="ltr">I died a lot playing Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl.</p><p dir="ltr">Like the 2008 original, developer GSC Game World's long-awaited sequel is a punishing affair, because life is difficult and fleeting in the Zone--the irradiated area around Chornobyl filled with deadly, physics-defying anomalies, mutants, and various people who will kill you for just about any reason. If you fail to keep your wits about you in the Zone, your time there will end quickly, making exploring Stalker 2's open world both fascinating and oppressive.</p><p dir="ltr">I recently played a little more than three hours of Stalker 2 that covered the beginning of the game and its opening few missions. My experience in the Zone could sometimes get frustrating, especially after trying to take down the same group of bandits four or five times, only to get overwhelmed and shot to death or blown up by one guy's extremely well-placed grenade. But once I started to get the hang of keeping myself alive by moving

## Microsoft Kills $1 Game Pass Trial Just Days Before Black Ops 6 Launches

<p>Microsoft is no longer offering $1 Game Pass trials, killing the option just days before <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2024-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6523361/">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> launches into Game Pass on October 25. So anyone who wanted to sign up for the 14-day $1 trial to play Black Ops 6 won't have the ability to do that effective immediately.</p><p>This is in keeping with tradition for Microsoft, as the company also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/1-xbox-game-pass-trial-deal-disappears-ahead-of-starfield-launch/1100-6517244/">removed the $1 Game Pass trial just ahead of Starfield's launch in September 2023.</a> The only way to play Black Ops 6 at launch through Game Pass now is by subscribing to Game Pass Ultimate at the full $20/month rate.</p><p>Black Ops 6 is arguably the biggest Game Pass launch since the subscription service debuted. No previous Call of Duty game in the franchise's history has been available at launch
