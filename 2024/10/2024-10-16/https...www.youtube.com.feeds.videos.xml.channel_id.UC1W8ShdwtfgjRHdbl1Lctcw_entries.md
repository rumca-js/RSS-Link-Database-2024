I colorized, restored, and created a sound design for this video of Marseille, France in the 1918-1919, you'll witness the vibrant life of Marseille over a century ago. The bustling streets are filled with scenes of boutique shops and store displays, showcasing daily commerce. Streetcars glide through the lively districts, while the port is a hub of maritime transport

Video Restoration Process:
✔ FPS boosted to 60 frames per second
