Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Kamala Harris unveils her plan to win the black male vote. It involves free money, weed, and maybe reparations. She also reportedly has a plan to win the white male vote. It involves an interview on Joe Rogan's show. That would be a disaster for her campaign. I hope it happens. Plus, a major cultural appropriation controversy has broken out: a Hollywood actor is taking a company to task for selling tea. Everyone knows you can't sell tea unless you're Asian.
