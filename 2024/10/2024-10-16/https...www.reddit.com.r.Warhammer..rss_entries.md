<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello friends. My partner has started getting right back into painting and he&#39;s really enjoying it. Up to now I have bought him a wet palette and brushes which he has been making great use of.</p> <p>I&#39;m considering upgrading him to an airbrush for speed and also because I think he&#39;d enjoy painting larger figurines if he had an airbrush to help colour blends. I know absolutely NOWT about the gaming or painting side. Those of you with an airbrush - would you consider it something good to have in your painting arsenal? If so, what paints are best to use? </p> <p>If not an airbrush, what would you guys want from your girlfriend for Xmas/birthday related to the hobby? He has loads of books, he could probably do with some more paints so I&#39;m gonna top him up, I got him the Rogue Trader book last year and he has a lot of pretty decent brushes so I am feeling a bit lost. </p> <p>Thanks in advance! ðŸ’œ</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone, I really hope this is okay to post here. To preface I have never played any warhammer before yesterday and Iâ€™m honestly clueless. My boyfriend was teaching me how to play Spearhead (I think that was the name) yesterday using his little rat army. He was talking about a big model you can get that is a rat made of rats and is around Â£40. I was wondering if anybody knew the name from my lacklustre description? His birthday is next week and Iâ€™d love to surprise him with it.</p> <p>Thanks! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/inkyzink"> /u/inkyzink </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer/comments/1g4ur70/im_looking_for_a_model_for_my_boyfriends_birthday/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer/comments/1g4ur70/im_looking_for_a_model_for_my_boyfriends_birthday/">[comments]</a></span>
