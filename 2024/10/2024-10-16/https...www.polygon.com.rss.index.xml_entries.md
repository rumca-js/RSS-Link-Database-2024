We love this year’s <em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/impressions/446232/crimson-diamond-julia-minamata-text-parser-review-impressions-interview">The Crimson Diamond</a></em> for its modern retreading of classic titles (even if its text parser interface is occasionally awkward). If you’d like to try your hand at cracking the case, you can currently pick it up from GOG for just <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/the_crimson_diamond">$13.49</a> (was $14.99). </p>

<p>I always breathe a sigh of relief after the announcement of a new Aardman Animation project. The studio behind some of the most imaginative stop-motion projects of the last 50 years has never been a household name or box-office titan like Walt Disney Animation, but founders Peter Lord and David Sproxton’s&nbsp;quirky claymation company remains just as vital to the art.
