<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey folks, we are using celery + AmazonMQ(RabbitMQ) for our task scheduling.</p> <p>Now and then we have to revoke some task that are scheduled to run after day or 2.</p> <p>So the problem is if we revoke a task and server restarts due to some reason. The revoke state of the task is lost.</p> <p>The persistent revoke section in celery tells to use a file to store revoke state. But as server restart it is built from AMI. So the files are lost.</p> <p>Please suggest how can I tackle this problem.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/new_coder_01"> /u/new_coder_01 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/1g5dasf/celery_task_state_persistence/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/1g5dasf/celery_task_state_persistence/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Sometimes people here ask for examples of interesting Django projects with free/open source code.

It can use curl, wget or even chromium to save pages as HTML archives, PDF archives, screenshots, etc.</p> <p>It&#39;s gotten some attention lately due to the recent archive.org outage. The two projects are unrelated.</p> <p>I found it because archive.org and archive.ph outages lately have made me want something I could throw on my own server and use to save sites I&#39;d like to keep around for future reference.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/gbeier"> /u/gbeier </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/1g59ogp/archivebox_is_an_interesting_foss_django_project/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https:/
