Piranha Games is back with a brand-new MechWarrior title. MechWarrior 5: Clans differs from Mercenaries, offering a linear single-player campaign focused on Clan Smoke Jaguar as they partake in Operation Revival, part of the Clan Invasion of the Inner Sphere.

You're part of a new Star alongside other promising cadets as they battle through various biomes and conditions, taking out hostile BattleMechs. Though the narrative isn't extraordinary in terms of writing or voice work, it does present some compelling conflicts. Also, despite the simplistic mission design, the combat feels good, as controlling a skyscraper-sized machine of destruction feels just right.

MechWarrior 5: Clans launches on October 17th for Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC. Whether it lives up to the older titles or not, there is plenty of BattleMech chaos and customization for long-time fans to delve into.
