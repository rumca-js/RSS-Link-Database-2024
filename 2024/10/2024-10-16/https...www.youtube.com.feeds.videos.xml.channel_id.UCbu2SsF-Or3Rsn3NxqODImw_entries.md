## S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 Is A Frightening But Alluring Return To The Zone | Hands On Preview

Weird anomalies, spooky mutants, and humans likely to gun you down repeatedly await in Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl, and it all works to make the Zone an oppressive but fascinating place.

Like the 2008 original, developer GSC Game World's long-awaited sequel is a punishing affair, because life is difficult and fleeting in the Zone--the irradiated area around Chornobyl filled with deadly, physics-defying anomalies, mutants, and various people who will kill you for just about any reason. 

Having played three hours of Stalker 2 that covered the beginning of the game and its opening few missions, Phil Hornshaw found that his return to the Zone felt harrowing and invigorating in equal measure.
