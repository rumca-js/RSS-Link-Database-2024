Resettlement to a third country offers a durable solution for refugees who cannot integrate into their asylum or transit countries. While most studies focus on the experiences of refugees after their arrival in resettlement countries or on the political aspects of resettlement, fewer studies explore refugees' perspectives prior to resettlement.

Fish can accumulate high levels of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), even far from sources of contamination, according to a new study by researchers at The Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS). The research highlights the need for expanded monitoring in watersheds affected by large PFAS sources like military bases across the country that have been contaminated by use of PFAS containing foams for fire-training and fire-fighting activities.

Nano- and microplastic particles (NMP) are increasingly polluting urban and rural landscapes, where bees and other beneficial insects come into contact with them. If insects ingest plastic particles from food or the air, it can damage their organs and cause changes in their behavior, preventing them from properly performing ecosystem services such as pollination and pest control.

Geography textbooks describe the Earth's mantle beneath its plates as a well-mixed viscous rock that moves along with those plates like a conveyor belt. But that idea, first set out some 100 years ago, is surprisingly difficult to prove. A mysterious find on Easter Island, investigated by Cuban, Colombian and Utrecht geologists among others, suggests that the Earth's mantle seems to behave quite differently.

Messenger RNA–based therapeutics and vaccines are the new hope in the fight against incurable diseases. A commonly used strategy in the development of messenger RNA (mRNA) medicine is based on the destruction of disease-causing mRNA. Achieving the opposite and stabilizing health-promoting mRNA is still a great challenge.

The background noise of gravitational waves from orbiting white dwarf stars will be stronger than the noise from binary black holes. This is what two Dutch master's students and their supervisor predict in two papers in anticipation of the LISA space mission. Until now, that mission did not account for noisy white dwarfs. Fortunately, the noise can be filtered out and even provide new information.
