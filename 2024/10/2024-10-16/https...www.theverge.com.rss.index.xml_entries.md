  <p id="QUEKyb">DJI tells <em>The Verge</em> that it currently cannot freely import all of its drones into the United States — and that its latest consumer drone, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/15/24269740/dji-air-3s-drone-specs-price">the Air 3S</a>, won’t currently be sold at retail as a result. </p>

  <p id="iFqiUN">Meta has begun laying off employees across various departments, including WhatsApp, Instagram, and Reality Labs, according to people familiar with the matter. Rather than a mass, companywide layoff, these smaller cuts seem to coincide with reorganizations of specific teams.</p>
<p id="X7T0v1">Some Meta employees have started posting that they’ve been laid off. Among them is Jane Manchun Wong, who gained notoriety for reporting on unannounced features coming to apps before <a href="https://www.threads.net/@wongmjane/post/CuVaOg1PgU4">joining the Threads team in 2023</a>.</p>

The outdoor market is a small but trendy event that fills this corner every weekend, rain or oppressive shine. Among the typical antique market wares — racks of thrifted clothes, watches behind glass, bins of art — Dorado’s booth stands out. People slow down, sometimes chuckle, take photos, and summon friends over to look at all this. A crowd surrounds the modest shop, just a few fold-out tables covered in pink tablecloths.</p>
<p id="dU3jFg">Dozens of point-and-shoot cameras line the tables in rows, face up and laid flat; the circular lenses on each make it feel like you’re browsing whole fish at a seafood market....</p

Scribe users read more nonfiction than normal Kindle owners; a full 60 percent of Scribe buyers use the device at work. That’s maybe not shocking, given that the Scribe is the largest Kindle and the one with an included stylus for taking notes. But still: this is maybe the first Kindle ever to not be <em>mostly </em>a reading device, but rather equal parts book and notebook. Wit

  <p id="k4sGcx">By the time <em>MGM v. Grokster</em> hit the Supreme Court, the file-sharing industry had been roiling with lawsuits for years. The record labels had sued Napster in December 1999, baptizing the oughties with a spree of copyright litigation. But the public’s appetite for piracy didn’t go away, and for every Napster that was sued into oblivion, three more sprung up in its place. Their names are now commemorated only in the court decisions that eventually destroyed them: Aimster, StreamCast, and of course, Grokster.</p>

  <p id="56mdMV">Decades before we got married and started a family, my partner and I connected over a little Boxer pup named Charlie. We tossed a ball around, scrubbed him down when he got dirty, and took him for daily walks. It was a bonding experience — mediated entirely through the original Nintendo DS’s touchscreen. The tactile experience turned an otherwise simple game like <em>Nintendogs,</em> where the goal is to take care of virtual pets, into something that created a deep emotional connection. And years before smartphones were in everyone’s pockets, it helped show a generation of gamers just what’s possible with a t
