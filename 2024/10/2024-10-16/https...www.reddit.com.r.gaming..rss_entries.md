<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone! I’m an indie game dev who, after losing my game job last year, started working on my own game, <em>Legends of Boom</em> as a way to stay focused and positive. I’ve always loved Midway sports games like <em>NBA Jam</em> and <em>NFL Blitz,</em> as well as card games like <em>Hearthstone</em> and <em>Magic.</em> This game is my attempt to blend those worlds, and I even managed to get Tim &quot;Boomshakalaka&quot; Kitzrow on board, practically for free! I’m not here for sympathy, just honest feedback to see if <em>Legends of Boom</em> captures the fun me and my small team of devs are aiming for. </p> <p><strong>Legends of Boom</strong> Steam Next Fest Demo: <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3271940/Legends_of_Boom_Demo/">https://store.steampowered.com/app/3271940/Legends_of_Boom_Demo/</a></p> <p>Thanks so much.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>When I say &quot;life simulator&quot;, I mean closer to Animal Crossing (and partially Harvest Moon). (Even Pokémon Gold/Silver has some more agreeable &quot;aspects&quot;, like some phone calls and the bug catching contest).</p> <p>Not counting the Persona series, please.</p> <p>And &quot;fantasy adventure&quot; where you level up through fighting, like a JRPG.</p> <p>I know there are multiple out there that looks like they are nicely blending both, but which are the better? Where should I start?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Adagar91"> /u/Adagar91 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1g4o95l/what_are_some_goodthe_best_games_that_blends_life/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1g4o95l/what_are_some_goodthe_best_games_that_blends_life/">[comments]</a></span>
