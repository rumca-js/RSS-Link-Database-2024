<p>The 1TB SK Hynix Tube T31 is one of our favorite portable SSDs and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SK-hynix-1000MB-External-Compatible/dp/B0CQZCWHTQ/">it’s on sale right now for $67.49 on Amazon</a>, which is a sizable 25 percent dive down from its normal $89.99 price.</p>

<p>Lunar Lake? Arrow Lake? After Intel launched both of those chips, it’s now turning its sights to the next processor on its roadmap: Panther Lake.</p>



<p>Intel chief executive Pat Gelsinger showed off what we presume to be a prototype of Intel’s next processor at Lenovo Tech World, where he appeared on stage to — among other things — promote the new, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2490420/amd-intel-form-x86-advisory-group-to-fend-off-arm.html">unexpected X86 advisory board collaboration</a> with AMD and its chief executive, Dr. Lisa Su. </p>



<p>Lenovo showed off its new Aura Edition PCs, and Gelsinger was on stage to praise the laptop’s use of the Core Ultra processor and reveal that this is the laptop that he’s personally using. “Can you have great battery life and X86? Yes. That debate is now over,” Gelsinger said.</p>

<p>Tired of your packages being stolen by porch pirates? You can actually do something about it — by getting a Loxx Boxx, which is essentially a smart home locker that securely receives deliveries.</p>



<p>And right now, you can <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Loxx-Boxx-Secure-Package-Delivery/dp/B088VQ2W8Y/">get your own Loxx Boxx for just $249 on Amazon</a>. That’s a whopping $100 off its usual retail price.</p>



<p>Here’s how it works: When ordering products, you provide an access code to the carrier, who then uses the access code to open the Loxx Boxx and place the shipment inside. The Loxx Boxx itself can be mounted to your porch, but it’s also heavy enough on its own to deter theft.</p>



<p>If you input tracking numbers into the Loxx Boxx app — whether via USPS, Amazon, UPS, or FedEx — the last four digits of the tracking number automatically beco

Google is thus closing 17 security vulnerabilities in its browser, none of which appear to have been exploited for attacks to date. Manufacturers of other Chromium-based browsers should follow suit soon.</p>

<p>A 27-inch screen and 1440p resolution seems to be the new sweet spot for monitors, and I’m here for it. Honestly, it’s about time we moved past the 1080p/24-inch baseline.</p>



<p>If you’re ready to upgrade, Amazon has one such monitor <a href="https://www.amazon.com/KTC-Inch-100Hz-Computer-Monitor/dp/B0D4QVHWPJ/">on sale for just $100 today</a>, which is about $70 less than even the cheapest ones we’ve seen lately. And it comes with a high-quality IPS panel to boot! (It’s originally $160 but knocked down to $110 right now, plus there’s an extra $10 on-page coupon you can clip that gets it down to $100.)</p>



<p>What’s the catch? Good question, savvy shopper. The catch is that this is a generic white-label brand that I’ve never heard of before. Though the Amazon reviews average 4.4 stars with more than a thousand ratings, those reviews aren’t always tr

<p>It’s 2024 and yet some internet service providers in the US still charge you if you go over an allocated monthly data limit. Why? It’s not as if internet access is a finite physical resource. It doesn’t cost Comcast more to deliver you 1,001 gigabytes versus 999 gigabytes.</p>



<p>Well, the United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is now looking into it, with an eye to possible regulatory action.</p>



<p>As of yesterday, the FCC has released a “<a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/FCC-24-106A1.pdf">Notice of Inquiry</a>” (PDF), which is the federal government’s version of “I’ve got my eye on you.” The Commission waxes poetic on the current state of the market for both home and mobile broadband internet plans, especially considering how the public’s usage patterns have changed and expanded post-COVID, and whether or not data cap
