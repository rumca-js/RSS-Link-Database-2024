<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone. I just have a quick question. I&#39;ve noticed that my RSS reader, The Old Reader, has been unable to generate feeds for specific things. For instance, I follow the RSS feeds of several friends&#39; Goodreads accounts, but The Old Reader refuses to generate a feed for another friend&#39;s account, even though they are active on the site and it works for everyone else. Furthermore, the built-in RSS feeds on Rate Your Music don&#39;t seem to do anything really. Does anyone know why/have any potential fixes?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/-Houses-In-Motion-"> /u/-Houses-In-Motion- </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1g4qcej/unable_to_generate_specific_feeds/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1g4qcej/unable_to_generate_specific_feeds/">[comments]</a></span>
