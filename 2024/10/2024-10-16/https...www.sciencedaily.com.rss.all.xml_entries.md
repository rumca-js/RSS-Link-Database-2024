Researchers have mapped how small RNA molecules, such as the recently Nobel Prize-awarded microRNAs, control cell development in the human embryo during the first days after fertilization. The findings may eventually contribute to improved fertility treatment.

With heart attacks, every second counts. A new blood test diagnoses them in minutes rather than hours and could be adapted as a tool for first responders and people at home.

## The neutron lifetime problem -- and its possible solution

How long do free neutrons live until they decay? This has been a hotly debated topic, because different measurement techniques lead to different results. A possible new solution has now been proposed: All the results can be explained, assuming there are different neutron states with different lifetimes.

## The monarch butterfly may not be endangered, but its migration is, researchers find

With vigorous debate surrounding the health of the monarch butterfly, new research may have answered the biggest question plaguing butterfly researchers. Why are the wintering populations declining while breeding populations are stable?

## Men and women process pain differently, study finds

According to new research, men and women rely on different biological systems for pain relief, which could help explain why our most powerful pain medications are often less effective in women.

## Zebrafish as a model for studying rare genetic disease

Nager syndrome (NS) is an extremely rare disease that causes developmental problems and anomalies in facial bone structures and limbs. While the causative gene is known, its underlying mechanisms remain obscure. Researchers from Japan employed genetically engineered zebrafish and found that the mutation in the gene that causes NS, suppresses the Fgf8 levels. This, in turn, affects the expression pattern of a critical cell population called neural crest cells in facial development.
