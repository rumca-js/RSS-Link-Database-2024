A recklessly expeditious gobbler-up of doorstoppers, I had skimmed through many a dull descriptive paragraph in my time. But I didn’t want to miss a single word of Pride and Prejudice. Austen had mastered the storyteller’s art of providing ever so slightly less detail than I craved. Like many other readers before and since, I was hooked.</p><p>Though Austen’s famous free indirect narration is all but impossible to transfer to the screen, Pride and Prejudice’s dialogue adapts like a dream, and so we keep bloody well doing it.

<p>Today Westminster begins its scrutiny of a bill that could for ever change the way we live or die in England and Wales </p><p>Christiaan Barnard, the surgeon who performed the world’s first heart transplant, vividly skewered the notion of patients “freely” choosing to have such dangerous, experimental surgery. They were, he wrote, like someone chased by a lion to the bank of a river filled with crocodiles, who decides to hurl themselves into the water: “For a dying man, it is not a difficult decision because he knows he is at the end … But you would never accept the odds if there were no lion.” Barnard captures a fundamental flaw in libertarianism that is horribly pertinent, whether we like it or not, to Kim Leadbeater’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/03/assisted-dying-bill-parliament-kim-leadbeater-labour-mp">choice at the end of life bill</a>.

<p>This documentary about pioneering female musicians is three parts joy to one part fury. Yes, there’s misogyny and betrayal but mainly it’s the sheer elation of being in a gang</p><p>The first Scottish girl band to break into the charts were the McKinlay Sisters in 1964, a pop duo formed by Jeanette and Sheila McKinlay. The McKinlays played with the Rolling Stones and toured with the Beatles but, says Jeanette, looking back, they were exploited – not paid enough to even live on. They celebrated Sheila’s 20th birthday in their London bedsit with a bag of chips. When the Beatles’ manager Brian Epstein offered to manage them, the band’s label said they already had a manager. It was a lie. Not long after, that same label dropped the McKinlays and they faded into obscurity.</p><p>It’s just one of the episodes in this brilliant documentary about pioneering Scottish girl bands that will leave you raging. And there’s more music industry misogyny where that came from; as recently as 2010, <a

<p>The method actor traces his path to success, spending as much time on the films that flopped as the greatest hits</p><p>Al Pacino, whose nickname “Sonny Boy” comes from the Al Jolson song of that title, begins this fine memoir in 1943 when he is three and his mother, Rose, a pretty, sensitive factory worker, starts smuggling him into the local picture house. Together they drink in the stories unspooling from the silver screen, doubly delicious since their own lives are so bleak. Rose’s impossibly handsome boy-husband has already skedaddled to another marriage and Rose has taken little Alfredo back to the South Bronx to live with her parents. Sonny delights in the role of provider and protector, buying his mother Kotex from the drugstore and shouting at the construction workers who dare to leer.</p><p>Pacino’s account of New York’s postwar mean streets is startlingly cinematic. He introduces us to his gang of little toughs, kids called Cliffy, Bruce and Petey who bunk off school to
