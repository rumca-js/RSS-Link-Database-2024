<p>Weather Up offers an innovative, glanceable widget and complication design, with interactive widgets that supported the new tinted mode in iOS 18. Weather Up is built by privacy fanatics (we round off significant digits so even our server doesn’t get your precise location, and the weather data providers only see our server IP address so they can’t sell location data for fingerprinting and IP address geolocation) and can view multiple forecast sources on a single Home Screen. And the widget is simply <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRfpk6gCYMo">the best there is</a>.</p>

<p>Try Weather Up free of charge for 7 days and then <a href="https://apps.apple.com/redeem?ctx=offercodes&amp;id=1196015787&amp;code=GRUBER">use this link for 50% off</a> on the first year of a subscription to the best damn weather widget and Apple Watch complication in the business.</p>
