I made a pihole Cname, vault.home.local-&gt;home.local, and I reverse proxyed it with Nginx.</p> <p>At first the domain checker docker wouldn&#39;t even start, don&#39;t know why, and when I got it working it just didn&#39;t want to accept the domain, with an error that was cutted on half, like if the error had an error.</p> <p>I&#39;ve tried so many things I don&#39;t even know where to continue now. Maybe it can&#39;t be done?

I have a raspberry pi 4, running AdGuard Home, connected to the router of my ISP provider. As the router doesn\u2019t allow me to change the DNS, I deactivated its DHCP server to use the one from AdGuard Home instead. I configured a static IP on both eth0 and wlan0 interfaces using nmtui. I also use PiVPN to access my home network remotely. But every few minutes my devices lose the connection and then it comes back, etc. (being at home or away via the vpn). When I try to ssh the rpi, I regularly get a timeout or host down but I noticed that it happens only on the eth0 interface (the one used by the DHCP server) and not the wlan0.
