I just have a quick question. I&#39;ve noticed that my RSS reader, The Old Reader, has been unable to generate feeds for specific things. For instance, I follow the RSS feeds of several friends&#39; Goodreads accounts, but The Old Reader refuses to generate a feed for another friend&#39;s account, even though they are active on the site and it works for everyone else. Furthermore, the built-in RSS feeds on Rate Your Music don&#39;t seem to do anything really. Does anyone know why/have any potential fixes?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/-Houses-In-Motion-\"> /u/-Houses-In-Motion- </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1g4qcej/unable_to_generate_specific_feeds/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1g4qcej/unable_to_generate_specific_feeds/\">[comments]</a></span>", "id": 1332309, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1g4qcej/unable_to_generate_specific_feeds", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 482, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Unable to Generate Specific Feeds?", "vote": 0}]
