<p>The single biggest new feature in <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2337441/the-best-new-features-and-fixes-in-python-313.html">Python 3.13</a> is something Python users have anticipated for ages: a version of Python that allows full concurrency between Python threads by <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2338862/python-moves-to-remove-the-gil-and-boost-concurrency.html">removing the Global Interpreter Lock</a>. Whether you call it “free-threaded” or “no-GIL” Python, the result is the same: a sea change in the way Python handles application parallelism.</p>



<p>How do you actually <em>use</em> Python’s new free-threading features? In this article, we’ll walk through how Python

<p>JavaScript is the clear choice for front-end development today, but there is a longstanding push to be able to use Java on the front end. Among other things, Java brings a vast ecosystem of libraries, frameworks, and application code, which can be exposed via its APIs. <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/java/">Java</a> and languages like it also offer performance optimizations that <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2263137/what-is-javascript-the-full-stack-programming-language.html">JavaScript</a> can’t match.</p>



<p>Historically, Java’s sophisticated garbage collection algorithm was an obstacle, but Google’s recent push to implement Java’s garbage collection support in Chrome sugges
