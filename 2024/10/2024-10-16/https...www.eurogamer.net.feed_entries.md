## Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart on PS5 Pro - a straight upgrade for the performance RT mode

<img src="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/RATCHET-SITE-(1).jpg?width=1920&height=1920&fit=bounds&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp" /> <p>Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart is still an absolute technical highlight on the standard PS5. Combining beautiful animation, fantastic modelling, and excellent lighting tech - including a pioneering implementation of RT reflections - the game still ranks among the best-looking titles on the platform. However, in classic current-gen fashion, developer Insomniac offers multiple modes, each with their own trade-offs in terms of  graphical features, performance and image quality. The brand new PS5 Pro patch aims to make that choice a lot simpler, giving players the combination of RT reflections, fine image detail and 60fps performance on PS5 Pro. Does this upgrade elevate Rift Apart from its base console counterpart? And how close does it come to matching the PS5 fidelity mode? </p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-ratchet-and-clank-rif
