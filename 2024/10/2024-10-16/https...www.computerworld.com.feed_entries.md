<p>The potential split up of Google that’s been proposed by the US Department of Justice (DOJ) could weaken the company, and thus the position of the US in its tech war with China, said former President Donald Trump, who suggested he may not break up the company if he wins the presidency again in November.</p>



<p>In comments made while speaking Tuesday at an event with Bloomberg News during a meeting of the Economic Club of Chicago, Trump said, “China is afraid of Google,” according to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/15/us/politics/trump-google-monopoly-china.html?smid=nytcore-android-share">a report of the event</a> in the New York Times. He went on to wonder whether splitting Google w

<p>While we wait for the <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3545089/whats-new-for-apple-intelligence.html">Age Of Apple Intelligence</a>, it may be worth considering a <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.05229" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent Apple research study</a> that exposes critical weaknesses in existing artificial intelligence models.</p>



<p>Apple’s researchers wanted to figure out the extent to which LLMs such as GPT-4o, Llama, Phi, Gemma, or Mistral can actually engage in genuine logical reasoning to reach their conclusions/make their recommendations. </p>

<p>Oh, hello Android 15. How’s <em>that</em> for an all-around excellent October surprise?</p>



<p>Yes, indeedly: Google’s latest and greatest <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/1714347/android-versions-a-living-history-from-1-0-to-today.html">Android version</a> is officially on its way to Pixel devices near and far this week, just over a month after Google <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2024/09/android-15-is-released-to-aosp.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dropped the source code</a> in an unusually detached move.</p>

<p>The organization <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido-alliance-publishes-new-specifications-to-promote-user-choice-and-enhanced-ux-for-passkeys/">Fido Alliance</a> has developed a proposal for a new standard for passkeys — i.e., alternatives to passwords such as hardware keys, facial recognition, fingerprints or PIN codes.</p>



<p>The big news in the proposal is that it will be possible to use the same passkeys even if you change platform or service, something that would make it significantly easier for users than at present.</p>

<p>Windows Update can be a pain. Rebooting for updates is one thing — but a <em>forced</em> reboot for updates that shut down your running applications when you’re trying to get work done? Now, that’s obnoxious.</p>



<p>Windows Update hit rock bottom in the early years of Windows 10. Back then, lots of people I know complained to me that Windows Update had automatically rebooted their PC and messed up their work — often to install a major update that made that reboot take an especially long time!</p>



<p>The good news is that Windows Update is less irritating now; whether you’ve <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/1633757/should-you-upgrade-to-windows-11.html">upgraded to Windows 11<

<p>The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Department of Justice have aggressively targeted Big Tech, suing Meta, Google, Amazon, and Apple for antitrust violations. And it’s not doing so in a small way — it’s filed <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/1635715/googles-us-antitrust-trials-a-timeline.html">multiple law suits against Google</a>, for example. In August, Judge Amit Mehta <a href="https://www.pacermonitor.com/view/VZTUTSQ/UNITED_STATES_OF_AMERICA_et_al_v_GOOGLE_LLC__dcdce-20-03010__1033.0.pdf?mcid=tGE3TEOA">ruled the company violated antitrust law</a> by actions it took to protect its search business. </p>
