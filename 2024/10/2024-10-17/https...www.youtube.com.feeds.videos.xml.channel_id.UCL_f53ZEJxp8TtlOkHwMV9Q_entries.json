Peterson sits down with filmmaker and activist Robby Starbuck. They discuss Robby\u2019s choice to abandon the life of a Hollywood filmmaker, what broke his faith in the Democratic ideology, why a willingness to risk everything is necessary for substantive cultural change, exactly how Robby is taking on woke corporate America, and why it's working.\n\nRobby Starbuck, a filmmaker and anti-communist once directed Oscar-winning actors and some of the biggest music stars in the world but seeing the threat of Marxism in America set a fire inside him due to his own Mom and grandparents fleeing communism in Cuba.

Hollywood didn\u2019t like that very much.\n\nThis episode was filmed on September 20th, 2024\n\nUnlock the ad-free experience of The Jordan B.
