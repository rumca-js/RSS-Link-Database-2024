## Any modern FPS with a game mode similar to CrossFire's Ghost mode?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>CrossFire back in the late 2000s had a special PVP mode called Ghost mode where it&#39;s regular shooters vs Ghosts, who were knife only players who went invisible when not moving. </p> <p>If they moved only a barely opaque shadow of the model would be seen, with a quick fadeout time of like a couple of seconds between stopping movement and turning fully invisible. The downside was that Ghosts always had a breathing sound not unlike Vader that was audible from a certain distance, on top of audible footsteps and environmental cues such as water puddles. And the win conditions were either Elimination, or Bomb Defuse/Detonate.</p> <p>A unique feature of the game mode was that Ghosts <strong>can</strong> move while <em>staying invisible</em> and that was through a reverse crouch bunny hop, which allowed for some really creative kills.</p> <p>So I missed playing that game mode so much and wondered if any modern FPS have a similar mode?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON

## What Drives A Trophy Hunter?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I lot of people are quite serious about earning trophies in gaming, and will try to 100% every game they play. Why though? In many games you will be stuck hours on end doing the most mundane tasks, where is the fun in that? I see games as entertainment, and not as a chore simulator. With any game I&#39;m playing, the second I&#39;m not enjoying myself, I quit and play something else instead. A good example for me would be finding all the Koroks in Zelda BotW/TotK. Hogwart&#39;s Legacy also has a ton of hidden collectibles. I love both games, but will never ever reach 100% because I can&#39;t be bothered to wander around aimlessly looking for objects (or using a guide). Are there gamers that really do enjoy this sort of thing, or will they happily endure boring gameplay just to get that platinum trophy fix?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Botol-Cebok"> /u/Botol-Cebok </a> <br/> <span><a href="https
