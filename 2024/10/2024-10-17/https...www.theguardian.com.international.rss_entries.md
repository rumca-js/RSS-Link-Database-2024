<p>The script is thick with jokes, Simon Bird and co are a joy to behold and scenes just zip along. This take on an ultra-conservative church is reinvigorating old-school comedy</p><p>How do you make the old-school sitcom – with its improbable plotlines, cartoonish characters and gimmicky setting – feel fresh and relevant in 21st-century Britain? Apparently, the answer is to shun the modern world altogether. Following the devout Lewis family, Everyone Else Burns pitches up in a Manchester-based evangelical church (and doomsday cult) where misogyny, homophobia and a shockingly dated sense of community are all alive and well. It’s deliberately unrelatable material presented in doggedly artificial, stupid hairdo-heavy style. As a contemporary comedy it shouldn’t work, but – by God – it really does.</p><p>The brilliance of Everyone Else Burns – now returning for a second series – is partly the result of a script thick with quirky jokes, but mainly down to a cast who are simply a joy to be

<p>The destruction in northern Italy has ignited debate in a country where just 6% of homes are insured against natural disaster</p><p>It was 2am when the parish priest, Giovanni Samorì, was woken by a phone call from the mayor of Traversara ordering him to start ringing the church bells. The traditional call now forms part of the civil protection procedure deployed by many Italian towns. Its aim: to warn residents of impending calamity.</p><p>As torrential rain pounded the village, Samorì sprang into action, a task he compares to “sounding the death knell”. It worked: the evacuation of Traversara’s 480 residents was swift and, despite the priest’s foreboding, there were no deaths.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/17/its-shameful-and-i-wont-pay-it-flood-hit-italians-rage-against-insurance-call">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Ozon and a stellar cast serve up an entertaining, if shallow caper that shades a little too close to #MeToo</p><p>François Ozon has directed plenty of complex, demanding and serious dramas: Everything Went Fine, Summer of 85 and By the Grace of God, along with adaptations of Fassbinder. But he also has a sweet tooth for breezy, silly, crowd-pleasing theatrical comedies like this one (which does however appear to contain a Fassbinder reference, if you look hard enough). Watching it is like being force-fed a large box of chocolates; moreish, though. There is certainly an amazing blue-chip cast of French movie-acting royalty, including Isabelle Huppert, Fabrice Luchini and André Dussollier.</p><p>The Crime Is Mine is adapted from a 1934 French stage comedy called Mon Crime by Georges Berr and Louis Verneuil which has already spawned two different madcap Hollywood versions in the 30s and 40s, respectively starring Carole Lombard and Betty Hutton.

<p>A proposed Italian-German bank merger makes sense for Europe, but Berlin is opting for domestic protectionism</p><p>A potential merger between a German bank and an Italian rival would not normally elicit much interest beyond the business pages. But these are not normal times. The Italian bank UniCredit recently provoked a political backlash in Germany by <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/23/unicredit-boosts-its-stake-in-commerzbank-applies-to-own-up-to-29point9percent-of-the-german-bank.html">acquiring a 21% stake</a> in the German lender Commerzbank. Even chancellor Olaf Scholz weighed in, calling the Italian move “an unfriendly attack”.

<p>Newly ‘discovered’ underwater topographical features are paving the way for nation states to exploit previously untouched marine resources</p><p>“The sea does not belong to despots,” Jules Verne wrote in 1869 in Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea. “Upon its surface men can still exercise unjust laws, fight, tear one another to pieces, and be carried away with terrestrial horrors. But at 30 feet below its level, their reign ceases, their influence is quenched, and their power disappears.”</p><p>Now, more than 150 years later, geopolitics experts are warning that Verne’s final sentiment, expressed as it was through the character of Captain Nemo, was wrong. From seabeds and sea caves to sea canyons, underwater ridges, seamounts, sea knolls and reefs, academics say countries around the world are using the politics of nationalism to permanently stamp their mark on the topography of the ocean.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/oct/17/scramble-for-the-oceans-how
