Modern astronomy has clung to the belief that the relativistic outflows or jets, responsible for the existence of electromagnetic radiation of particularly high energies, are located in the nuclei of active galaxies distant from Earth. However, a different picture of reality emerges from the latest data from the HAWC observatory: Jets launched by astrophysical sources from our own intra-galactic "backyard" are also sources of gamma photons of extremely high energy.

Optical forces, which act like an invisible "hand," are capable of precisely controlling tiny particles. Optical tweezers, a well-known tool, use this force to capture and manipulate small objects such as cells, bacteria, and viruses. This effect is based on the transfer of momentum from photons to particles—when light interacts with a particle, it generates enough force to move it. Arthur Ashkin's development of optical tweezers earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2018.

Terrestrial plants have developed strategies to cope with suboptimal conditions. Storage of nonstructural resources is one of those strategies. Nonstructural carbohydrates (NSCs) of plants are primarily sugars and starch, and have been studied extensively to more fully understand how plants sustain productivity and recover from stress. Most plants use starch for storage and sucrose for transport of NSCs, but some species also rely on oligosaccharides for these functions

Countless bacteria call the vastness of the oceans home, and they all face the same problem: the nutrients they need to grow and multiply are scarce and unevenly distributed in the waters around them. In some spots they are present in abundance, but in many places they are sorely lacking. This has led a few bacteria to develop into efficient hunters to tap into new sources of sustenance in the form of other microorganisms.

A quasar is the extremely bright core of a galaxy that hosts an active supermassive black hole at its center. As the black hole draws in surrounding gas and dust, it blasts out an enormous amount of energy, making quasars some of the brightest objects in the universe. Quasars have been observed as early as a few hundred million years after the Big Bang, and it's been a mystery as to how these objects could have grown so bright and massive in such a short amount of cosmic time.

The innate immune response is the body's first line of defense against infection, and a successful immune defense takes a village: a combination of physical barriers, chemical attacks, and an army of specialized white blood cells. But maintaining and triggering such a complex operation requires coordination on a much smaller, biochemical level. And at that level, we're talking enzymes and proteins.

The reason for this is that calcium promotes the formation of the mineral aragonite, which binds CO2 and thus prevents the release of this greenhouse gas into the atmosphere.

Moiré superlattices are materials consisting of two layers stacked on top of each other with either a small rotational misalignment or a lattice mismatch between them. The Kondo lattice model, on the other hand, describes systems in which conduction electrons interact with localized magnetic impurities, which changes the systems' electrical and magnetic properties.
