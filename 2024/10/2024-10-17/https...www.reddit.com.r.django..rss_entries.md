The coordinates (latitude and longitude) should be stored in the database, and later I need to perform distance calculations to find all events within a certain radius from a given point.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am going through an official example of how to implement Oauth2 for using the quickbooks API. I am having trouble getting the state_token from the session variables within the callback view. Whenever I ise the oauth view it sends an authorization request to the quickbooks server. The request gives me a state token and a url to use to get an authorization code to use other APIs in quickbooks. I was able to print the state token in the oauth view by just printing &quot;request.session\[&#39;state&#39;\]&quot;. This lets me now that it is being saved in the session. So when I redirect to the given url, Quickbooks sends me a code with the same state_token it gave me using the callback view in this example. The callback endpoint is requested by the Quickbooks server for validation purposes to make sure the state_token given back and the state_token in the session are the same, otherwise it&#39;ll return an error.
