<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Greetings everyone. I&#39;m a student studying Computer Engineering and on the OS course I&#39;ve been assigned the task of making my own kernel for Risc-V architecture.</p> <p>For processor emulation, we use Qemu on Linux and xv6 is the underlaying connector to IO devices (console) so we don&#39;t really need to delve into printing very letters to the console etc.</p> <p>According to the assignment, kernel shall have some basic concepts implemented such as threads and semaphores and the usual operations with them. All of this shall work singlecore.</p> <p>So, I&#39;ve managed to do this assignment and finish the course, but I&#39;ve been wondering ever after if I could make this kernel utilise multiple processors. And so i did a brief research, but I still don&#39;t have it sorted out how these secondary processors (harts) are initilised and how they communicate with the boot core (hart 0).</p> <p>I&#39;ve been reading about initialisation process (Z

## How is DynamoRIO support looking lately?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I want to build an instruction tracer for RISC-V using DynamoRIO, an instrumentation program (see <a href="https://dynamorio.org/">https://dynamorio.org/</a> ). I know the official docs don&#39;t mention RISC-V support (nor are there official builds yet for it), but support has been added over the last five years, and it does build and run on RISC-V machines. The open bug request has been tracking related commits, but even reading them, it&#39;s hard to tell how complete support is.</p> <p>Has anyone tried it? Does it seem complete enough for me to take execution instruction traces?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/TheCatholicScientist"> /u/TheCatholicScientist </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1g5hrpz/how_is_dynamorio_support_looking_lately/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1g5hrpz/how_is_dynamorio_support_looking_latel
