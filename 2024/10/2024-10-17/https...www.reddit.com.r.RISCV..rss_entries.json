I&#39;m a student studying Computer Engineering and on the OS course I&#39;ve been assigned the task of making my own kernel for Risc-V architecture.</p> <p>For processor emulation, we use Qemu on Linux and xv6 is the underlaying connector to IO devices (console) so we don&#39;t really need to delve into printing very letters to the console etc.</p> <p>According to the assignment, kernel shall have some basic concepts implemented such as threads and semaphores and the usual operations with them. All of this shall work singlecore.</p> <p>So, I&#39;ve managed to do this assignment and finish the course, but I&#39;ve been wondering ever after if I could make this kernel utilise multiple processors. And so i did a brief research, but I still don&#39;t have it sorted out how these secondary processors (harts) are initilised and how they communicate with the boot core (hart 0).</p> <p>I&#39;ve been reading about initialisation process (Z", "id": 1340248, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1g5n4va/riscv_multicore_os", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 471, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Risc-V multicore OS", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-10-17T03:30:02+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I want to build an instruction tracer for RISC-V using DynamoRIO, an instrumentation program (see <a href=\"https://dynamorio.org/\">https://dynamorio.org/</a> ).
