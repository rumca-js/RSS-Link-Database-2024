But it isn\u2019t without its risks. Not only is there the risk of accidentally downloading a malicious file or malware, but there\u2019s a privacy risk as well \u2014 your ISP can see all your online activity and they usually don\u2019t take too kindly to torrenting. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s why it\u2019s imperative that you use a VPN while doing any torrenting or P2P file sharing. A VPN can keep your connection private and encrypt your data so that unwanted prying eyes \u2014 cybercriminals, overbearing ISPs, or nosy government watchdogs \u2014 can\u2019t monitor your online activity.
