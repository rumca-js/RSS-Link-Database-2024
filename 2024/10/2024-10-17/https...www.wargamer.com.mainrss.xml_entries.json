First released in Germany in 1995, Catan's 1996 English language edition was the tip of the spear for European board games entering the Anglo-American market.</p>\n<p>Catan's success made English speakers eager for more games like it, which lead to more Eurogame imports. Those in turn inspired American designers to innovate, increasing the visibility of their games in Europe where they began to influence Eurogame design.
