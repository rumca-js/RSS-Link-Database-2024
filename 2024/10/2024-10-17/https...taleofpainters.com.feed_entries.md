<p>Having finished my Spearhead in my last Stormcast post, I turned my brush to painting a few more units from the Skaventide launch set. In this post, I'll share photos of my Lord-Terminos, Knight-Questor and 5 Liberators. I'll also share paint recipe guide, so you can paint your Hallowed Knights the same way. </p>
