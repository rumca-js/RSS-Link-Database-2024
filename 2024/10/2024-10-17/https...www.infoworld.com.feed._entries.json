The Task.WhenEach method allows us to iterate through tasks as they complete, without having to call Task.WaitAny repeatedly in order to select the next task that completes. Task.WhenEach will be beneficial particularly in scenarios where you are waiting for tasks that differ in their execution times.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the Task.WhenAll and Task.WhenAny methods also can be used to handle multiple tasks, they have certain limitations that Task.WhenEach was designed to solve.
