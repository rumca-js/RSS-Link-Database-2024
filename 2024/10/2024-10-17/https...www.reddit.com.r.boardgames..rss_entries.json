The box is pretty small, it fits 2 decks of cards side by side.</p> <p>Now, I have some questions:</p> <p>Do you think $25 is an acceptable price? It will be $20 in the campaign, but MSRP is intended to be \u00a319, which is almost $25. </p> <p>And for shipping to your country, what would you be willing to pay? Right now I have a rate of $18 for shipping to USA, which I think it&#39;s pretty high, and I could maybe lower it to $15 by paying some of the shipping myself, but idk if it&#39;s viable for me. </p> <p>I&#39;m confident on the MSRP price, it&#39;s a good price for me, but I want to hear opinions. But for shipping i&#39;m not sure. I feel it too high but I can&#39;t decrease it without raising the funding goal too much and therefore making it harder to fund... </p> </div", "id": 1339612, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1g5jvde/msrp_and_shipping_prices_consensus_what_do_you", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 473, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "MSRP and Shipping prices consensus.
