Spurs are still some way off a crisis, but it’s an impasse that could cause combustion. “I didn’t get here by doing what everyone else is doing,” Postecoglou told Australian media this week, admitting that “sitting” on the Brighton loss – in which <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/06/never-underestimate-the-true-spursiness-of-this-tottenham-team">Spurs completely collapsed</a> in the second half – has made for an agonising international break.

The death of the man who&nbsp;masterminded the 7 October massacres in southern Israel that killed more than 1,200 people would mark a key moment in the conflict. It could renew momentum for a ceasefire deal and hostage release – as <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/hostage-families-demand-govt-leverage-sinwars-apparent-demise-to-secure-immediate-deal/">families</a> of those held have demanded.

<p><strong>Sherman theatre, Cardiff<br></strong>Tim Price’s play links a 1980s coal miner with Odysseus in an affecting if heavy-handed mythological drama </p><p>Forty years after the 1984 miners’ strike, Tim Price’s play maps Homer’s Odyssey on to events that already carry the weight of their own mythology. Our Odysseus is Welsh miner John O’Donnell (Rhodri Meilir) who is subjected to the caprices of unseen authority figures and must journey to faraway lands.</p><p>His wife, Penny, faithfully – if not passively – awaits for his return in a drama where the women do much of the heavy lifting. Sara Gregory is excellent in the role, becoming the production’s emotional core, and the delicacy of the brief scenes with her friend Shaz (a wonderful Lisa Zahra), focusing on the activities of women who sustained their communities during the strike, are the most affecting.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2024/oct/17/odyssey-84-review-tim-price-sherman-theatre-cardiff">Continue rea

Not content with the controversial advantage playing home games at high altitude in La Paz used to give them, the Bolivians have recently and quite literally cranked things up several notches. Moving another 560m uphill, they played their last two home games more than four kilometres above sea level at the Estadio Municipal de El Alto, where the air is so thin visiting teams might as well be trying to play in outer space.

Originally intended for a streaming premiere, the $17m movie was elevated to a theatrical release after enthused test screenings, going on to make $217m worldwide, a huge win for Paramount and the genre at large. It was a slick, stylishly made attempt to update a familiar supernatural curse formula with the modern addition of a trauma narrative, a parasitic demon acting as a metaphor for the horror of inherited mental illness.</p><p>The film’s creator, Parker Finn, showed flair as a director but flaws as a writer, unable to push his ton

<p>New England manager has a reputation for winning knockout ties but some of the best international coaches have had modest careers at domestic level</p><p>“Just nuances,” Thomas Tuchel says. As an outsider turned insider, England’s new permanent manager was mulling over the team’s long history of falling short. Was it tactical? A lack of individual quality? Perhaps, but in Tuchel’s eyes losing a major final on penalties or to a late goal was not necessarily evidence of a seismic failing. Sometimes, as the German says, success in international football really is just about mastering the little details in the biggest moments.</p><p>That said, the Football Association’s hope is that replacing Gareth Southgate with one of the world’s leading managers will ensure that England finally add a second star to the shirt. Tuchel does not hang around. The German’s aim is simple: win the 2026 World Cup. It is safe to assume that he will not view this job as a “process” or a “project”.</p> <a href

<p>Celery is very versatile, but rarely essential – and too often left to wilt in the fridge. These recipes put it centre stage</p><p>While people who dislike celery tend to have strong feelings about it, the rest of us find it hard to believe such an innocuous vegetable could even inspire opinion, much less divide it. A couple of chopped celery stalks can almost always add something to a dish, even if its subtlety means it sometimes goes unnoticed.</p><p>In fact, celery’s versatility presents a problem: we buy it because it’s so useful, but we often forget to include it because it tends to be optional. Instead, we leave it to go bendy in the fridge until it’s time to buy more (although you can quickly revive limp celery by standing the cut stalks in cold water, like flowers in a vase).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/oct/17/soups-salads-and-cake-17-delicious-and-surprising-ways-with-celery-the-neglected-vegetable">Continue reading...</a>

This is the extraordinary exploitation shocker that also conveyed – or anyway fabricated – an impassioned sympathy for a bullied teenage girl with learning disabilities and telekinetic powers.

<p>We must make this moment a watershed that quenches the hellfire that threatens to envelop Israel, Palestine, Lebanon and the entire region</p><p>Last Sunday night, as I was getting ready for bed, my friend Ali from the South Hebron Hills of Palestine sent me a text which read, “Israel is burning sleeping people alive in the refugee camps.” I clicked on the accompanying video and I could not believe what I saw: an inferno blazing, people running around screaming, and there, amidst the flame, a body writhing, crackling; a raised arm, reaching out for help, still attached to an IV. I waited for the following morning to share the video, until the event had been reported by reputable news outlets, because the images appeared too gruesome to be real – like they were something out of a movie – but they were real: an Israeli airstrike hit near the grounds of al-Aqsa Martyrs’ hospital in the central Gaza city of Deir al-Balah and killed at least four people.

<p><strong>(dh2)</strong><br>The Welsh producer’s latest handbrake turn takes her from dark-hued ambience to hypnotic euphoria on her poppiest record to date</p><p>In a world where artists are often cautioned to stay in their lane – to maintain a recognisable brand so you don’t get lost in a crowded, confusing market – there’s something impressive about Kelly Lee Owens. For the last seven years, her career has constituted a series of handbrake turns, fuelled by a disinclination to make the same record twice. Her debut album situated her at the nexus of ambient techno, shoegazing’s dreamy textures and the warm lo-fi fuzz of bedroom pop: for all its reliance on electronics, it was possible to detect that Owens had previously spent time as the bassist in an indie band, the History of Apple Pie. Inner Song, from 2020, was both more straightforwardly melodic and – with its four-to-the-floor beats – more dancefloor-focused; 2022’s LP.8 offered dark-hued ambience punctuated by punishingly di

<p>Home computing and the gaming industry have their origins in the iconic early 80s hardware, documented here in an homage to an eccentric pioneer</p><p>You’ll need a pretty high geek tolerance level for this very detailed and specialised account of Sir Clive Sinclair’s bestselling ZX Spectrum home computer, whose appearance in 1982 with its rubbery keys was thought to be as lovably eccentric as the man himself. But with this he revolutionised the market, educated the British public about the importance of computing, and virtually created the gaming industry from scratch. It was originally to be called the “Rainbow” in homage to its groundbreaking colour graphics; Sinclair instead insisted on “Spectrum” as it was more scientific-sounding.</p><p>Interestingly, the film shows that Sinclair’s flair for the home computing market arose from his beginnings in mail order and assembly kits for things such as mini transistor radios targeted at “hobbyists”, that fascinatingly old-fashioned wor

<p>My local Irish boozer is a quiet, no-thrills establishment – and I love it. But my friend’s drink order made jaws drop</p><p>I love my local pub in west London. It’s very Irish, which is how I like my pubs. You can’t move for gastropubs round me, and while they have their place, I’ll take my very Irish local any day over any of them. Unless of course I want something more substantial to eat than Tayto crisps. It’s generally rather quiet in there, outside your rowdier weekend evenings, and quiet time is what I tend to want from a pub these days. There are a few screens showing various sports, but the volume is usually unobtrusively low. I love this place.</p><p>But last week something happened that may have damaged my standing in this establishment for ever. I popped in early on a Friday evening with some old friends, a couple about my age who were down from the West Midlands for the weekend. One half of this happy couple is a very enthusiastic drinker; the other hardly takes alcoho

<p>Set centuries from now, this gripping tale of retribution against the corporations who fuelled climate breakdown has echoes of Cormac McCarthy</p><p></p><p>Tim Winton and speculative fiction may seem an odd combination. His novels excel at the here and now, depicting lives at the margins, young love and young parenthood, violence at the hands of fathers. But the harsh beauty of the western Australian landscape has long been a presence in his work, and Winton has also long highlighted his country’s fragility in the face of climate chaos, and been fiercely critical of the exploitation of Australia’s mineral wealth. So the cli-fi premise of Juice, his latest novel, could be a perfect Winton fit.</p><p>Set in an unspecified future, some centuries from now, the book opens on a man and a girl driving across a landscape blackened by ashes. The hellscape is worthy of the Mad Max franchise, with slave colonies springing up from the parched earth like termite mounds. There are echoes of <a h

Most famously, Nepi was ruled by the 15th-century Spanish cardinal Rodrigo Borgia, who gave it to his daughter Lucrezia after he became Pope Alexander VI. Lucrezia stayed at the fortress (today known as the Borgia Castle) following the murder of her second husband in 1500. These days,

Look to the speech his attorney general made this week; all the clues are there</p><p>Political speeches seem to fall like autumn leaves at this time of year. Speeches at party conferences.

<p>Getting rid of SDRT would pay for itself over time because other receipts would rise, abolitionists say</p><p></p><p>Rachel Reeves is looking for taxes to raise, rather than ones to abolish. Never mind: here is a tax that ought to be scrapped by a government that calls itself pro-growth, pro-business and pro-investment, which was the pitch at this week’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/oct/14/who-will-attend-uk-investment-summit-agenda">big summit</a>. What’s more, the enticing claim from abolitionists is that getting rid of the tax could – with a few qualifications – pay for itself over time because other Treasury receipts would rise.</p><p>The tax is stamp duty on shares – or, in full, stamp duty reserve tax, or SDRT. It is the 0.5% levy on purchases of shares in UK companies that brought £3.8bn into the Treasury in the 2022-23 tax year. Ireland has a higher rate, 1%, but nobody else does. The US, China and Germany don’t impose any equivalent tax at all. So the
