A new study reveals how the duplication of the salivary amylase gene may not only have helped shape human adaptation to starchy foods, but may have occurred as far back as more than 800,000 years ago, long before the advent of farming.

## Astronomers detect ancient lonely quasars with murky origins

Astronomers observed ancient quasars that appear to be surprisingly alone in the early universe. The findings challenge physicists' understanding of how such luminous objects could have formed so early on in the universe, without a significant source of surrounding matter to fuel their growth.

## Controlling prosthetic hands more precisely by the power of thought

Researchers have developed a novel training protocol for brain-computer interfaces in a study with rhesus monkeys. The method enables precise control of prosthetic hands using signals from the brain alone. Researchers were able to show that the neural signals that control the different hand postures in the brain are primarily important for this control, and not, as previously assumed, signals that control the movement's velocity. The results are essential for improving the fine control of neural hand prostheses, which could give paralyzed patients back some or all of their mobility (Neuron).

## Identifying the genes that viruses 'steal' from ocean microbes

A new study gets scientists closer to more fully understanding where viruses fit into the global ocean picture of cycling nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus and, of particular interest, carbon. Researchers report on their creation of a catalog of genes that viruses 'stole' from the marine microbes they infected across all of the world's oceans, identifying and organizing almost 23,000 genes known as auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs), including over 7,000 never previously documented.

Imagine tires that charge a vehicle as it drives, streetlights powered by the rumble of traffic, or skyscrapers that generate electricity as the buildings naturally sway and shudder. These energy innovations could be possible thanks to researchers developing environmentally friendly materials that produce electricity when compressed or exposed to vibrations.

## Plankton balloon to six times their size in newly discovered mode of oceanic travel

Many plankton journey from the cold, dark depths of our oceans to the surface, only to eventually drift down again into the darkness in a perpetual rhythm. Yet, how single-celled phytoplankton, most of which have no appendages to help them swim, make this pilgrimage has remained a mystery. Researchers now describe a species of bioluminescent phytoplankton, called Pyrocystis noctiluca, that balloons to six times their original size of a few hundred microns. This massive inflation allows the plankton to journey up to 200 meters toward the ocean's surface to capture sunlight, then sink back showcasing a unique strategy for long-distance ocean travel.

It may soon be possible to determine which patients with a type of liver cancer called hepatocellular carcinoma would benefit from immunotherapy, according to a preclinical study.
