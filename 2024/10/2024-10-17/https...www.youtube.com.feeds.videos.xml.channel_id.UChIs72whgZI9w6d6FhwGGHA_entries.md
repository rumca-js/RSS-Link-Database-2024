HAVN is a new brand from the CaseKing group and is making the HAVN HS 420 and HAVN HS 420 VGPU computer case, which is one of the most unique cases we’ve seen in a long time. The case has excellent overall construction quality, innovative ease-of-installation features and fan mounting options, and experiments with new cooling approaches. HAVN is formed by defectors from Fractal, Cooler Master, NZXT, and Sapphire and is backed by big money with the CaseKing group (CaseKing is one of Europe’s largest hardware retailers). Our review of the HAVN HS 420 tests 8 variations of 6-fan configurations, chosen as a head-to-head with the chart-leading Antec Flux Pro that we recently reviewed. Our benchmarks include thermals, acoustics, and build quality in comparison to some of the best gaming PC cases on the market.
