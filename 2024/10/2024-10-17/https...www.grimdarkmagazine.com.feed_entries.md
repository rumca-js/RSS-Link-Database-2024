<p>Warp Speed Warriors is an album by Dragonforce that fully embraces the somewhat zany image the British power metal band has cultivated over the years. There&#8217;s songs dedicated to The Legend of Zelda, Warhammer 40K, Bayonetta, video gaming in general, and Starship Troopers. There&#8217;s some slightly more serious songs amongst the work but these are not going to be what compels fans to purchase this album. Instead, it is probably the kitsch and homages to popular media products that its fans are already fond of. As many of these properties are squarely within Grimdark Magazine&#8217;s purview, I think Warp Speed Warriors is something that will appeal to a lot of the metal heads among our fanbase. &#8220;Astro Warrior Anthem&#8221; opens up the album and is one of the Warhammer 40K homages. It starts off with a slow synthesizer beat and then moves into the band&#8217;s usual guitar riffs. It&#8217;s a perfectly serviceable war song but not my favorite song on the album. By cont
