								<p>In the lingo of <strong>Dungeons and Dragons</strong>, and tabletop RPGs in general, 'murder hobo' is an unpleasant, but commonly used term for the type of player who's out to kill first, ask questions never, loot the bodies, and move on - regardless of the impact their actions have on the story or their fellow players. I've never been one - but I recently had an experience that reminded me how easy it can be to step over the line, and it taught me important lessons about good roleplaying.</p>

								<p>Few games have made a mark on the board game hobby like <strong>Catan</strong>. First released in Germany in 1995, Catan's 1996 English language edition was the tip of the spear for European board games entering the Anglo-American market.</p>
<p>Catan's success made English speakers eager for more games like it, which lead to more Eurogame imports. Those in turn inspired American designers to innovate, increasing the visibility of their games in Europe where they began to influence Eurogame design. This feedback loop ultimately led to the diverse board game hobby we know today. But the question in this 2024 <strong>Catan review</strong> is: should you bother with it today?</p>

								<p>When Wizards of the Coast took control of the <strong>Magic: The Gathering</strong> Commander format at the end of last month, it was very keen to deflect all attention away from the question of bannings. Instead, it pointed to its new plans to introduce ‘power brackets’, so that finally Commander players would be able to discuss how strong their decks were.</p>

								<p>I got to read <b>Dungeons and Dragons</b> brand-new 2024 DM’s Guide early, and I spotted one glaring omission from the ultimate Dungeon Master’s compendium. No, it wasn’t a key piece of advice on running D&amp;D campaigns. No, it wasn’t the recommended 6-8 combat encounters per day (though that <i>is</i> gone too). Wizards of the Coast has removed a single feature from its Bastions chapter – bathrooms.</p>
