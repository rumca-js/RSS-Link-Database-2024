<p>Here’s an interesting bit of follow-up. Last month, when linking to <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_24_4761">the European Commission’s announcement</a> of “two specification proceedings to assist Apple in complying with its interoperability obligations under the Digital Markets Act”, I wrote a sidenote on the EC’s seemingly willy-nilly use of boldface text:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Honest question: Can someone explain to me <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2024/09/ec-boldfacing.png">the Commission’s use
of boldfacing</a>? In the first 265 words of the press release,
66 of them are bold, across 13 different spans. They seemingly use
boldfacing the way Trump capitalizes words in his tweets:
indiscriminately. I find it highly distracting, like trying to
read a ransom letter. It’s not just this press release, they do it
<a href="https://x.com/RPUE_LU/status/1837026046245310784">all the time</a>.</p>

<p>Tim Hardwick, reporting for MacRumors:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The FIDO Alliance is developing new specifications to enable
secure transfer of passkeys between different password managers
and platforms. <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido-alliance-publishes-new-specifications-to-promote-user-choice-and-enhanced-ux-for-passkeys/">Announced on Monday</a>, the initiative is the result
of collaboration among members of the FIDO Alliance’s Credential
Provider Special Interest Group, including Apple, Google,
Microsoft, 1Password, Bitwarden, Dashlane, and others.</p>

<p>Passkeys are an industry standard developed by the FIDO Alliance
and the World Wide Web Consortium, and were integrated into
Apple’s ecosystem with iOS 16, iPadOS 16.1, and macOS Ventura.
They offer a more secure and convenient alternative to traditional
passwords, allowing users to sign in to apps and websites in the
same way they unlock their devices: With a fingerprint, a face
scan, or a passcode. Passkeys are also

<p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/10/17/dhh-argues-against-passkeys">Speaking of passwords</a>, Ricky Mondello — who has long been a leading member of Apple’s “Authentication Experience” team — has an interesting blog post describing the algorithm Apple uses when it suggests new strong passwords:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To make these passwords easier to type on suboptimal keyboard
layouts like my colleague’s game controller, where the mode
switching might be difficult, these new passwords are actually
dominated by lowercase characters. And to make it easier to
short-term have in your head little chunks of it to bring over to
the other device, the passwords are based on syllables. That’s
consonant, vowel, consonant patterns. With these considerations
put together, in our experience, these passwords are actually a
lot easier to type on a foreign, weird keyboard, in the rare
instances where that might be needed for some of our users.</p>

<p>And we weren’t going to make

<p>David Heinemeier Hansson:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Yes, passwords have problems. If you’re using them without a
password manager, you’re likely to reuse them across multiple
services, and if you do, all it takes is one service with awful
password practices (like storing them in plain text rather than
hashing them with something like bcrypt), and a breach will mean
hackers might get access to all your other services.</p>

<p>But just because we have a real problem doesn’t mean that all
proposed solutions are actually going to be better. And at the
moment, I don’t see how passkeys are actually better, and, worse
still, can become better. Unless you accept the idea that all your
passwords should be tied to one computing ecosystem, and thus make
it hard to use alternative computers. [...]</p>

<p>Bottom line, I’m disappointed to report that passkeys don’t appear
worth the complexity of implementation (which is substantial!) nor
the complexity and gotchas of the user experience. So we’re
