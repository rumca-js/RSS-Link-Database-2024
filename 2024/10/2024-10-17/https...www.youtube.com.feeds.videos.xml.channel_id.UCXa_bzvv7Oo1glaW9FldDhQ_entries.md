The game follows Haroona on her journey to avenge her fallen mentor as she comes to terms with her powers while facing off against the secret societies who want those powers for themselves. 

Gameplay consists of over-the-shoulder exploration and combat within a diverse range of environments, mostly within India. The exploration is fun but combat is hit or miss with repetitive encounters featuring some ability-restricting enemies such as the Gearheads. 

I mostly enjoyed the characters and story and wish there was more emphasis on exploration and stealth gameplay rather than melee combat. If you enjoy classic action-adventure games with a mysterious story, check out this game when it releases on October 18 th for PC, PS4/PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X | S.

All these years after it originally launched for the PS2, Konami's Silent Hill 2 remains one of the most compelling survival horror games of all time. It's laced with mysteries, secrets, attention to detail and hidden references that continue to stir discussion. That's especially the case with Bloober Team's remake.

Perhaps one of the longer-running theories of all time is that James Sunderland, the protagonist, is trapped in a loop. Wandering through Silent Hill again and again until he wakes up and realizes his crime. With the Silent Hill 2 remake, Bloober Team has seemingly embraced this theory.

Why are some of the classic events from the original changed? What are the Glimpses of the Past, and why do they feel more like echoes than simple references to Konami's classic? Join us as we investigate whether the remake occurs in an alternate timeline or if something else is afoot.

After what felt like a wait that would never end, the next chapter in the Dragon Age franchise is finally almost upon us. BioWare and EA have spent the last several months hyping up Dragon Age: The Veilguard, and though there was some skepticism surrounding it at first (and for good reason, given BioWare’s recent track record), with time, the fantasy action RPG has continued to look increasingly promising, with its story, its cast of characters, its new combat system, its RPG mechanics, and more looking better and better with each of the game’s new showings. 

Excited as we are to get our hands on Dragon Age: The Veilguard, as we count the days down to its launch, here, we’re going to go over a few key details that you should know about it.
