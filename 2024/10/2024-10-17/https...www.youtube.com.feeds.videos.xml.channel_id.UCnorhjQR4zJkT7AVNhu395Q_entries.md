In this video, I’ll show you how to use silicone to seal up common areas around your home’s exterior that require regular maintenance.

From siding and windows to brick and trim, I’ll walk you through the exact spots that often need a little extra attention to keep your home weatherproof and waterproof. By sealing up these vulnerable areas, you’ll prevent moisture from seeping in and causing costly damage down the road.
