<p>Torrenting, or P2P (peer-to-peer) file sharing, is a convenient way to download large files quickly. But it isn’t without its risks. Not only is there the risk of accidentally downloading a malicious file or malware, but there’s a privacy risk as well — your ISP can see all your online activity and they usually don’t take too kindly to torrenting. </p>



<p>That’s why it’s imperative that you use a VPN while doing any torrenting or P2P file sharing. A VPN can keep your connection private and encrypt your data so that unwanted prying eyes — cybercriminals, overbearing ISPs, or nosy government watchdogs — can’t monitor your online activity.

<p>Back in August, Microsoft started testing <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2423443/windows-11-gets-an-updated-microsoft-store-with-better-app-control.html">some new changes to the Microsoft Store</a> that primarily focused on a new Downloads section and a tweaked Library section. Yesterday, Microsoft started testing a new product page experience in the Microsoft Store.</p>



<p>Both the August changes and yesterday’s changes are currently only available to Windows Insiders across all Insider Channels, but according to the <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2024/10/16/microsoft-store-october-2024-update-rolling-out-to-windows-insiders/">Windows Insider blog post</a>, these changes “will also start rolling out to non-Insiders soon.”</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/ntdevlabs/tiny11builder">free Tiny 11 tool</a> has long been known in the Windows tinkering community for its ability to significantly shrink down Windows 11, making it take up significantly less space on the computer.</p>



<p>Shrunken-down Windows 11 installations that include the major Windows 11 24H2 update (that’s still rolling out) are now possible. If you don’t have enough space on your hard drive or SSD to install 24H2, you can use Tiny 11 to get it at a fraction of the space required.</p>

<p>Gaming PCs aren’t cheap, and gaming laptops are even, um, not-cheaper. But if you’re patient and willing to cut a few corners, you can occasionally find a great deal.</p>



<p>For example, this Lenovo LOQ gaming laptop delivers a one-two punch with an AMD Ryzen processor and Nvidia RTX graphics card, and <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/lenovo-loq-15-6-gaming-laptop-fhd-amd-ryzen-5-7235hs-with-12gb-memory-nvidia-geforce-rtx-3050-6gb-512gb-ssd-luna-grey/6578512.p?skuId=6578512">it’s only $550 at Best Buy</a>. That’s a whopping $250 off its original price.</p>



<p>While $550 is an amazing price for a gaming laptop, you have to set your expectations accordingly. The Ryzen 5 7235HS processor is a bit long in the tooth, and ditto for the RTX 3050 graphics card with 6GB of video memory. It’ll run most new games, but you may have to settle for medium sett

<p>It’s amazing what you can do with old tech, especially if you combine it with even older software.</p>



<p>Take the Nintendo 3DS, for example. Originally released in 2011 with a 268MHz processor, it wasn’t exactly a beast even back then. But one YouTuber managed to get the dual-screen handheld to boot Windows 95 for an entirely different flavor of gaming. (Old Nintendo consoles make popular platforms for modding, thanks to an absolutely massive userbase — over 75 million sold for the 3DS — and easy access to parts.)</p>



<p>One of the biggest additions to the 3DS homebrewing scene was a version of the popular DOSBox emulator, which was meant to get classic MS-DOS games running on the portable (much easier than on other gadgets thanks to its secondary touchscreen).</p>



<p>But you can also technically use DOS to boot into Windows, so that’s what Metra

<p>“Pig butchering” is an unsavory term for a <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2371413/most-common-phishing-scam-types.html">very specific kind of phishing attack</a>, wherein the scammer targets a wealthy individual with the lure of romance and then takes them for all they’re worth. It’s hardly a new idea — they used to call this kind of thing “fleecing” — but new software tools are making it a lot easier and more effective.</p>



<p>A ring of scammers in Hong Kong managed to use live “deepfake” video to steal millions from their victims.</p>



<p>Police in Hong Kong arrested 27 people who operated out of an office and conspired to rip off wealthy people by pretending to be attractive romance prospects and getting them to invest big bucks in phony cryptocurrency schemes.</p>

<p>If you spend a lot of time sitting in front of your PC or laptop, then you probably have a monitor in front of you. However, very few people pay attention to whether their monitor is actually set up correctly.</p>



<p>It doesn’t matter whether you use the monitor for working, gaming, or just browsing. In the long term, an incorrectly adjusted monitor can damage your eyes or cause headaches. Here’s how to avoid the biggest mistakes.</p>

<p>Well, I’m also happy to say that book yoga can become a thing of the past with two nifty Kindle accessories: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Gooseneck-Tablet-Holder-Lamicall-Stand/dp/B07GQNRQ86/">this gooseneck tablet stand</a> that’s now $22 (33% off) and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Oresoc-Control-Paperwhite-Accessories-Extenders/dp/B0CN92544C/">this remote page turner</a> that’s now $16 (36% off).

Yikes!</p>

<p>When I first started <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394076/best-free-password-managers.html">managing my passwords with Bitwarden</a> a few years ago, I had no intention of ever paying for it.</p>



<p>Bitwarden’s generous free tier was <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1339204/why-i-switched-to-bitwarden-for-my-password-manager.html">the entire reason I switched from LastPass</a> back in early 2021.

By comparison, Bitwarden syncs all your passwords across an unlimited number of devices at no charge, which was all I really wanted. I saw no need to pay extra for its premium features.</p>
