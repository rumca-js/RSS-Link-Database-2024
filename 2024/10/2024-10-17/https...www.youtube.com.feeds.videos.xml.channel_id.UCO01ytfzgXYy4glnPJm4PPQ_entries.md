Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the Kamala Harris campaign has been telling us that violent crime declined under her watch. That's what the FBI data showed. Well, it's just been revealed that the FBI data was completely wrong. This is a major scandal that isn't getting the attention it deserves. Also, Kamala was interviewed by Bret Baier on Fox yesterday. Her performance was atrocious, even by her standards. And, Jerry Seinfeld has had an epiphany. He now says that, actually, the woke scolds aren't ruining comedy, as he'd previously claimed.
