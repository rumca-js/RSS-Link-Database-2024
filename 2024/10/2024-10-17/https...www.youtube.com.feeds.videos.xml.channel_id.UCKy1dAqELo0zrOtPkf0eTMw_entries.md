Watch our Unknown 9: Awakening review, written by Travis Northup and reviewed on PC. Also available on Xbox Series X/S and PS5 (PlayStation 5).

"Unknown 9: Awakening is the kind of routine action-adventure game that probably wouldn't blow me away even if it was executed well – and the fact that it isn’t just makes the whole thing fall completely flat. Everything from the formulaic story to the shallow and dull combat and stealth are well below the standard set by genre peers, and the consistently disheveled performance and bugs don’t do Awakening any favors. There’s at least some fun to be had in its interesting reality-bending powers, especially the mind-controlling abilities that let you briefly play as your foes and sabotage the enemy in clever ways, but these bright spots run their course quickly, leaving us with a wholly underwhelming adventure."

## Smile 2 Review

Watch our Smile 2 review, written by A.A. Dowd and narrated by Erik Adams.

From the writer-director of the 2022 horror sleeper Smile comes a solid sequel that sicks the suicide-hex phantom on a pop star played – in a highly volatile, committed performance — by Aladdin’s Naomi Scott. Smile 2 doesn’t quite match its sadistically effective predecessor in the scare department, because once you’ve seen one phantom doppelganger grinning like the Cheshire Cat, you’ve seen them all. But the movie works as a nasty portrait of the downside of music-biz fame, and it builds to an ending deserving of every crooked smile it earns.
