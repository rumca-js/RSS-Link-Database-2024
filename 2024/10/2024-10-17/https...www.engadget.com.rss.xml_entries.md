It’s entering a <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/concord-is-going-offline-two-weeks-after-its-ps5-and-pc-launch-163134728.html">crowded and fraught marketplace</a>, but the publisher says this is an “exciting evolution” of the genre.</p>
<p>That evolution seems to take the form of some light roguelike mechanics. The playable characters evolve throughout each match, via semi-randomized upgrades unique to each hero. The publisher gives an example of evolving a sniper into a “close-range skirmisher” or a “support role into a powerful lone wolf.”</p>

<p>London’s W1 is somewhere to go if you’ve got too much money to spend on something. Within minutes of each other, you can visit the city’s priciest private doctor, buy a Steinway and a pair of designer glasses that cost more than my mortgage. Wigmore Street is also where the ultra rich go to buy a kitchen that Thorstein Veblen would weep at the sight of. It’s also the new home of Moley Robotics, a company selling luxury kitchens and the robot arm that’ll kinda/sorta do all of the cooking for you, too.</p>
<p>Moley is the brainchild of Dr. Mark Oleynik and is one part kitchen showroom and one part robot lab. It’s a spartan space with three demo kitchens, a wide dining table and some display units showing you the different types of artisan marble you can have for your countertop. The point of interest is the working X-AiR robot just behind the front window that acts as a lure for would-be consumers. It’s got its own cooktop, shelves, oils and utensils and, with the proper help, can ev

It costs more than the competition, but it offers a more polished experience (the screensavers are worth the price of admission) as well as more privacy protections. But you may not know that, with a VPN, you can use your Apple TV to access even more content. By downloading one of several VPN apps directly to the Apple TV, you can spoof your IP address, tricking your system into thinking you’re in a different country. And because most streaming services license different shows in different territories, flipping the VPN to an international location lets you access a wider array of content. Here’s how to use a VPN on your Apple TV and why you might want to install one.</p>

<p>In a barrage of Kindle hardware, Amazon might have something for anyone looking to upgrade from a basic Kindle. The biggest reveal might be the Kindle Colorsoft, its first reader with a color display. Amazon tried to ensure the reader has a good color and black-and-white experience, with high contrast, high resolution and high clarity whether you&#39;re looking at a color image or a black-and-white page. Amazon uses nitride LEDs, which work with the company’s algorithm to enhance color and brightness without washing out images.</p>
<p>Judging by the press images (and the demos we went to), these seem primed for graphic novels and comics. If you’re looking for something to digitally house your comics and manga, the Kindle Colorsoft will cost you $280 and start shipping on October 30.</p>
