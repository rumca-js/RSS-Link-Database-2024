Researchers have a new battle tactic to fight drug-resistant bacterial infections. Their strategy involves using collections of bacteriophages, viruses that naturally attack bacteria. In a new study, researchers at the University of Chicago Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering (PME) and UChicago Medicine have shown that a mixture of these phages can successfully treat antibiotic-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae infections in mice.

In companies, innovative ideas often come out of teams. That's why it's so important to have team members who are excited and focused on projects that lead to innovation. However, having team members who are too passionate—especially to the point of obsession—can actually stifle innovation, according to new research from Hui Liao at the University of Maryland's Robert H. Smith School of Business.

Meiotic recombination generates genetic diversity and promotes proper chromosomal segregation of parental chromosomes. This process requires a set of recombinases polymerized on single-stranded (ss) DNAs called the nucleoprotein filament to undergo homology search and strand exchange between homologous DNAs.

Every second, more than 3,000 stars are born in the visible universe. Many are surrounded by what astronomers call a protoplanetary disk—a swirling "pancake" of hot gas and dust from which planets form. The exact processes that give rise to stars and planetary systems, however, are still poorly understood.
