Having successfully made its way onto iOS and Android devices through a combination of ceaseless legal activity and new EU regulations, the Epic Games Store is ready to start tempting users away from Apple and Google's digital storefronts - and, in news that's unlikely to surprise anyone, it plans to do so by giving away free games.

## PS5 Pro and PSSR impress in The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered

<img src="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/-1621423840171.webp?width=1920&height=1920&fit=bounds&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp" /> <p>I think it's fair to say that The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered is perhaps not the highest priority when it comes to receiving a PS5 Pro upgrade. Packing a reasonable 1440p60 and 4K30 performance split on base PS5 consoles, the game was already delivering a good visual experience on Sony's 2020 hardware - but there is a compromise between image fluidity and image clarity. Part 2's PS5 Pro outing seeks to eliminate that gap, aiming to deliver a 4K-like visual experience at a full-fat 60fps frame-rate target by using Sony's new machine learning PSSR upscaling solution. How does PSSR fare in our first extended look at the technology? Is this a good replacement for native 4K, or does it fall short of that lofty target? </p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-ps5-pro-the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered-pssr-analysis">Read more</a></p>
