<p>(Constellation)<br>With their best work for two decades, the Canadian post-rockers have made an urgent soundtrack for an uncertain and dangerous world</p><p>Ever since they first appeared, fully formed, with 1997’s stunning <em>F♯ A♯ ∞</em>, Montreal’s Godspeed You! Black Emperor have been at their most potent when embellishing apocalyptic post-rock soundscapes with incongruous flashes of vulnerability and beauty. So it perhaps isn’t hugely surprising that their first album in three years sees them become one of the few western acts to release music that explicitly references the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza, from the blunt album title through to the press release’s reference to “every day a new war crime, every day a flower bloom”.</p><p>Musically, this is their strongest set since 2002’s <em>Yanqui UXO</em>, the three songs that pass the 10-minute mark particularly stirring. Raindrops Cast in Lead builds slowly via a repeating motif on distorted guitar, before a gentle interl

<p>Georgia’s conspiracy theorists are still disputing the result of the last US presidential election. Will this year’s be more peaceful? I looked for clues in the Atlanta suburbs</p><p>A few weeks ago, I found myself standing in the white marble atrium of Georgia’s state capitol building, watching a scene that encapsulated much of the presidential race. To my right: a cluster of election conspiracy theorists who still believe Donald Trump won in 2020. To my left, a group of voting rights campaigners, singing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPuBGcng6Tw">an old spiritual</a> popularised during the civil rights era.</p><p>They were here to observe last-minute efforts by hard-right officials to alter <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/20/georgia-state-election-board-meeting">the way in which votes will be counted</a> next month.

<p><strong>(Eastern Margins)<br></strong>This exhilarating compilation pushes from K-pop to trance, hardstyle techno, budots and beyond – and is at its best when artists rachet up the intensity</p><p>London-based independent label Eastern Margins’ 2021 debut compilation Redline Legends was a joyous, high-energy documentation of the burgeoning electronic music being produced in the cities of east and south-east Asia. From the kitsch melodies of the Filipino budots style to the uptempo house of Indonesian funkot and the melodramatic EDM drops of Vietnamese vinahouse, Redline Legends showcased the homegrown artists pioneering this frantic, lo-fi music. The second instalment in their series, Redline Impact, now explores how the diaspora is pushing these sounds into faster, harder territory.</p><p>Across 17 tracks the compilation covers everything from K-pop to trance, hardstyle techno, budots and hardcore, all tied together by the ever-presence of thumping kick drums and spangling synth m

<p><strong>(Matador)</strong><br>Also featuring Matt Sweeney, Jim White and Emmett Kelly, the quality and variety of songwriting on this self-titled debut album raises it above a stoner jam session</p><p>An indie/alt-rock supergroup-of-sorts featuring Stephen Malkmus (Pavement, the Jicks), Matt Sweeney (Chavez, Superwolf), Jim White (Dirty Three) and Emmett Kelly (Cairo Gang, Ty Segall), the Hard Quartet’s debut has an audible vibe of four guys enjoying hanging out, sharing vocals and playing together.</p><p>There’s plenty of the scuzzy guitars, big riffs and off-kilter melodies of their regular groups. The songs careen from preening avant-glam (steamrollering opener Chrome Mess) to early Buzzcocks-type power-punk (Renegade) but it’s mostly a cosmic, trippy affair, with drug references and at least one outright paean to marijuana in the lovely Heel Highway (“Rustling up some liquid hash to make some colours flash”).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/oct/04/the-hard-q
