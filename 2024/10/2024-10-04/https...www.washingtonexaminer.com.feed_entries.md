Israel continued its attacks against Hezbollah with a strike against the head of Hezbollah&#8217;s executive committee, Hashem Safieddine, the person presumed to succeed former leader Hassan Nasrallah. It&#8217;s not clear if Safieddine was killed, though according to Lebanese news reports, the strike was larger than the one that killed Nasrallah on Sept. 27. Safieddine was [&#8230;]

VANCOUVER, Washington — NFL linemen on Sundays and scattered other game days want to throw their rivals to the ground — or worse. Yet these often 6-foot-7-inch, 315-pound tacklers and defenders also show grudging respect for their professional opponents, who, like them, have reached the pinnacle of their profession through skill and hard work. In [&#8230;]

Numbers are everywhere in Washington. Budgets, deficits, statistical studies, probability analysis, trade figures, and so on. Sometimes, numbers are being used opaquely, to obscure what’s really going on. It’s an occupational hazard if you work in public policy in Washington, D.C. Other times, however, the numbers tell a story that is so obvious it’s downright [&#8230;]

During a 2017 television appearance, then-Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), eyeing a long-shot bid for the Democratic presidential nomination three years on, declared, “Everybody needs to be woke.” In his three serious runs at the White House, former President Donald Trump has campaigned as an anti-woke, tough-on-crime candidate. At a Sept. 29 rally, for instance, the [&#8230;]

HAPPY VALLEY, Oregon — Financial advisers frequently warn clients that when it comes to stocks and other financial investments, past performance is no guarantee of future results.

It was the most awkward moment of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s week in America, a week in which his one mission was to convince the United States and its allies that Ukraine has a realistic plan for victory after 2 1/2 years of war with Russia.

Hassan Nasrallah is dead. The 64-year-old leader of Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed, Lebanese-based terrorist group, was killed in an Israeli airstrike in Beirut on Sept. 27. To a large extent, Nasrallah helped build the modern Middle East, with all its wars and accompanying horrors. Few men have spread more death and destruction. The late British historian [&#8230;]

I have never seen a Hallmark movie, watched more than 10 consecutive minutes of a soap opera, nor read a single word written by Colleen Hoover, the romance author whose works have sold over 20 million copies.

One of the challenges in Army basic training was staying awake through tedious lectures. Some of these classes were important, teaching key aspects of Army culture.

The pure unadulterated hatred Sen. J.D. Vance (R-OH) inspires from certain demographics is remarkable. Last month, a clip of Vance talking about the impact of regulations on family formation went viral. Here is what he said during a 2023 Senate hearing: “American families aren&#8217;t having enough children. I think there&#8217;s evidence that some of the [&#8230;]

Like a lot of things in the Bible, the Ten Commandments get it all slightly wrong. I don’t mean the “Thou shalt not kill” material — I’m basically OK with that. It’s the smaller things that, in my view, need an editorial refresh. For instance, the 10th Commandment gets it all backward. “You shall not [&#8230;]
