<p>Nintendo and Sony are teaming up to make a live-action Legend of Zelda movie, and actor Haley Joel Osment wants to be in it. In a new interview, Osment said he's been a fan of the series since he was a kid and is eager to put his hat in the ring to play Link. He joked that maybe he's now too old, at 37, to play Link, but you never know.</p><p>"Oh, my hat's in the ring, they know my hat's been in the ring," he told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/zelda-was-haley-joel-osments-star-wars-and-he-wants-to-be-in-the-live-action-movie?utm_source=threads,twitter">IGN</a>.

<p dir="ltr">Unlike the contentious launch of its predecessor, Diablo 4 arrived last year with a reasonably strong foundation that Blizzard has nurtured thoughtfully in the months since, giving its first expansion much less heavy lifting to do in the hearts and minds department. Diablo 4 doesn't necessarily require an overhaul, but that's what it feels like it's getting next to its biggest content addition yet. That means you don't have to own Vessel of Hatred to enjoy some of the most exciting changes arriving alongside it, but without it you would be missing out on the game's most dynamic class yet, which makes Vessel of Hatred a blast to play.</p><p dir="ltr">If you've been away from Diablo 4 for sometime then you'll be happy to know that Vessel of Hatred isn't designed solely for those who have stayed engaged in demon-slaying since launch last year. If you want to hop right into the campaign of the expansion, you're given the option to do so with a new character from the start, so

Already a visually impressive game on the base model PS5--which itself was a big upgrade from the original PS4 version--The Last of Us Part 2 on PS5 Pro is aiming for a consistent 4K 60fps experience. As shown by Digital Foundry, it looks like Naughty Dog is hitting this target.</p><p>In a tech breakdown, the channel showed off new footage of TLOU2 on PS5 Pro. Using the PS5 Pro hardware in conjunction with Sony's PSSR upscaling software, TLOU2 is upsampled from a 1440p internal resolution at 60fps to reach its 4K goal, ultimately creating a sharper-looking and smoother game in comparison to the softer graphics seen on base PS5 consoles.</p><p>Some of the highlights here included more realistic hair effects, improved environment detail

<p>It's been a long time since voice actor David Hayter stepped into the role of Snake. For years, the character had been voiced by David Hayter, who became synonymous with the role. Though <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hayter-to-hear-another-snake-voice-makes-me-a-little-ill/1100-6406237/">Kiefer Sutherland</a> joined the ranks as Venom Snake, fans still carried Hayter's banner. Hayter's rendition of the character was seen in other properties as Super Smash Bros., with the game reusing previously recorded dialog, but the actor seemed to tease a return to the role in an unspecified project.</p><p>Taking to his <a href="https://x.com/DavidBHayter/status/1841994392896442768?t=xoUspc_un2dUmTvZmA2Ehw&amp;s=19">Twitter</a>, the actor said he was back in the recording booth Thursday, saying he was playing a role he hasn't done in a long time.

As expected from a strategy title, the minimum specs are less demanding than your average AAA game, but running the game on ultra settings will require a surprisingly powerful PC.</p><p>The game's minimum standards ask for a Nvidia GTX 1050 GPU or better, Intel Core i3-10100 CPU or better, 8GB of RAM, and a 20GB SSD, meaning most PCs should be able to handle Civilization 7 on low graphics settings. Recommended settings, which will play the game on a medium graphics preset, requires a Nvidia RTX 2060 or better, Intel Core i5-10400 or better, 16GB RAM, and a 20GB SSD.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/CivGame/status/1841870892449640471" data-has-image="true"><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet" data-conversa
