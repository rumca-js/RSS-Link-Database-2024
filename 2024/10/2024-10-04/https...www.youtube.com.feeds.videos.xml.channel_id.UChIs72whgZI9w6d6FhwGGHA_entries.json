The Lian Li Lancool 207 is up for review today, a new ATX case for under $100. It's compact, but still ATX. The Lancool 207 is fully focused on thermal performance at the price, taking a number of key steps to improve airflow and thermals at the expense of some trade-offs for cable management, dust management, and ease of installation. The Lancool 207 follows Lian Li's 216 and 215 cases previously, and we've added the 216 to the charts for a comparison. We'll also look at less expensive cases, like the SilverStone 515XR and Fractal Pop Air, and more expensive cases, like the Fractal Torrent, North, and the Antec Flux Pro.\n\nWe'll be adding even more cases as we go!\n\nThe best way to support our work is through our store: https://store.gamersnexus.net/\n\nRELATED PRODUCTS [Affiliate Links]\n\nLian Li Lancool 207 on Amazon: https://geni.us/HILbWU\nLian Li Lancool 207", "id": 1266045, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8zwlzc_uD4", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 428, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UChIs72whgZI9w6d6FhwGGHA", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/e8zwlzc_uD4/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Lian Li Lancool 207 Airflow Case Review | Cable Management, Build Quality, & Benchmarks", "vote": 0}]
