After all, we don\u2019t need another algorithm controlling what we read or don\u2019t read.

They cover very broad topics but the algo will learn i\u2019m mainly interested in EU news and Android.</p> <p>Is there anything out there that would help me get close to this? </p> <p>Even if it doesn\u2019t learn specifically from me, maybe something that identifies and filter what\u2019s more popular.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/gugavieira\"> /u/gugavieira </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www", "id": 1267871, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1fw3vxz/rss_feed_filtered_by_popular", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 482, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "RSS feed filtered by popular", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-10-04T15:12:49+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Why am I not capturing all of the WSJ feeds directly through my RSS in Inoreader? I&#39;m a paid WSJ member and have access to their public RSS feeds for sections like Opinion, World News, U.S. News, Market News, Technology, and Lifestyle. According to their website, these are the available feeds, unless I\u2019m missing something.</p> <p>Could someone help me understand why the WSJ app has so many more updates, but my RSS feed shows much less to almost none? Is there a way to ensure that I get all of their articles in Inoreader instead of using the WSJ app? I tried to fetch their website using a bot, but it blocks me.</p> <p>I manage several subscriptions and rely on my Inoreader RSS app to process between 1,000 and 5,000 articles a day. Switching between different news apps is not an option, as I need features like marking articles as read, tracking trending topics, filtering and removing duplicate, and more, which Inoreader does seamlessly.
