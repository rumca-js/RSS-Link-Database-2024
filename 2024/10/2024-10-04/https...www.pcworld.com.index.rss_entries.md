<p>Amazon apparently wants to milk Prime Video even further by showing more ads than ever before. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/amazon-prime-video-is-getting-more-ads-next-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to Ars Technica</a>, Amazon will test how much advertising it can get away with before Prime Video viewers revolt (or even cancel their subscriptions altogether).</p>

<p>September 5 gave us Thunderbird 115.15.0, which was the last release of version 115 (“Supernova”) and also the last version to still run on Windows 7, Windows 8, macOS 10.12, macOS 10.13, and macOS 10.14.</p>



<p>But if you thought things were going to be simple again, you were wrong. Going forward, Thunderbird will have <em>four</em> release channels on its <a href="https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/download/">download page</a>, similar to what we see with Firefox.</p>
