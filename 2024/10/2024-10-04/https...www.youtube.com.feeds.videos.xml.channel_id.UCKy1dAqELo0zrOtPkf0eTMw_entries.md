In today's Daily Fix:
Ubisoft has been having a rough go of it as of late. Star Wars Outlaws was not the big sales hit they expected, the next mainline Assassin's Creed game has been delayed to 2025, and their Call of Duty competitor, XDefiant, has failed to catch on. Co-founder Yves Guillemot and Ubisoft's partners at Tencent are reportedly considering taking the company private to help stabilize their financials. In other news, Sony is once again requiring a PSN account for a single-player PC game, this time for the Horizon Zero Dawn remaster. They've also taken the original version off Steam, so if you want to play the first game and you don't already own it on PC, you'll have to get the remastered version and sign up for PSN. And finally, Solid Snake English voice actor David Hayter is teasing another Metal Gear project. Could this be something related to the upcoming MGS Delta? Or possibly something new?

Shudder invited IGN to the set of V/H/S Beyond, the latest installment in the stalwart found-footage horror franchise, for an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the filming of "Stork," a segment directed by Thankskilling director Jordan Downey. From the practical effects that helped the Stork take flight to the intricacies of planning that go into making found-footage effective, the cast and crew of V/H/S Beyond were quick to share all the details they could with us... except for the nature of one bloody scene they wanted to surprise us with at the end of the day...

The new trailer for Ghost of Yōtei is here and in three minutes, Sucker Punch has managed to tease a ton of cool details from Japanese history. Placed 300 years after the story of Jin and Ghost of Tsushima, Ghost of Yōtei takes us to a time of turmoil in the Hokkaido region, which was known as Ezo in 1603 and not really considered part of Japan. It was the perfect destination for fleeing Ronin and Wokou, who were escaping the newly appointed Tokugawa shogunate. Since the trailer was released I’ve been poring over the details it contains translating the text, brushing up on Japanese history, finding out about the Matsumae clan, and learning all about the indigenous people called Ainu, because I’m incredibly hyped for Ghost of Yōtei. Here’s why.

Early roles in classic movies like The Sixth Sense, A.I.: Artificial Intelligence, and Forest Gump may have made him a household name, but it's been Haley Joel Osment's interesting project choices and passionate approach to his craft that have kept him in the minds of movie fans ever since. Osment joins IGN to talk about his career as he plays through three of his favorite games: The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, Halo 3 and, of course, Kingdom Hearts. Osment has voiced Kingdom Hearts' protagonist Sora for over 20 years at this point, and with Kingdom Hearts 4 on the horizon and seemingly set to be the beginning of the end for the action RPG series, Osment is starting to consider what life could look like without returning to his spiky-haired, Keyblade-wielding digital avatar.

Diablo 4: Vessel of Hatred reviewed by Travis Northup on Xbox Series X/S and PC, also available on PlayStation 5.

Diablo 4: Vessel of Hatred is an awesome expansion that adds an excellent new area to explore, a gloriously modular character class that I can’t stop playing, an impressive debut raid activity, and lots more. But while just about everything it adds to the action is awesome, it definitely doesn’t do enough where the somewhat flaccid campaign and story is concerned, and numerous bugs can occasionally drag it down. Thankfully, the changes to the meta, a greatly improved progression system, the resurrection of rune words, and NPC companions are all major wins for Diablo 4, even if it seems like we’ll be waiting a while to see where this interlude expansion leads.

After a five-year wait, Joker: Folie à Deux, the hotly anticipated follow-up to Joker, is finally out in theaters. While the original movie embraced ambiguity, this sequel is less opaque in depicting what is real and what is a figment of Arthur Fleck’s imagination. Nevertheless, there are still some things in the film that may leave viewers scratching their heads.

Like for starters, is Arthur Fleck even THE Joker? 

So let’s break down the events and ending of Joker: Folie à Deux and gain some insights from director Todd Phillips along the way.

SpongeBob SquarePants: The Patrick Star Game reviewed by Sarah Thwaites on PC, also available on PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch.

SpongeBob SquarePants: The Patrick Star Game is obviously geared more towards kids than those of us who grew up loving SpongeBob, but so are things like Astro Bot and Super Mario Wonder, and those games are brilliant. By contrast, the lack of exciting puzzle solutions or meaningful challenges offered across this six-hour adventure is bad enough that it feels like an underestimation of that audience. Propped up by the iconic and playful world of Bikini Bottom, it makes a strong first impression that quickly wears thin. Its physics-heavy sandbox can briefly be a joy to explore if you’re a fan of the TV series, however the slew of monotonous minigames and host of on-loop conversations within it fail to fully capture that show's spirit. Without an engaging goal or overarching story to latch onto, the end result is a repetitive and uninventive adventure that

Silent Hill 2 reviewed by Tristan Ogilvie on PlayStation 5. Also available on PC.

"Silent Hill 2 is a welcome modernisation of a survival horror masterpiece. It smoothly polishes down the rough edges of the original game’s combat while taking a piece of heavy grit sandpaper to scuff up every rust and mold-covered surface of its nightmarish environments, successfully making them appear far more abrasive and menacing to explore. Previously primitive boss battles have been transformed into substantially more intense encounters, and its intimidating audio design kept me acutely aware that every fog-cloaked street I walked down could quickly hurry me towards my own dead end. It does feel a little padded out in parts, and I do wish that Bloober Team had streamlined some of its more convoluted puzzle sections to prevent the story’s momentum from sagging on occasion. Still, intermittent pacing problems aside, Silent Hill 2 is a great way to visit – or revisit – one of the most dread-inducing
