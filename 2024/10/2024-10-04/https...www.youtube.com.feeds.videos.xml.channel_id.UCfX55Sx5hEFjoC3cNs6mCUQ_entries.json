This session offers practical insights into leveraging foundational NLP principles alongside advanced LLM technology. It's based on a business problem where the need is to craft technical content that directly tackles the key challenges customers encounter. Rather than wading through hundreds of public forum posts or customer complaints manually, why not harness the combined power of traditional, explainable Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques integrated with the advanced language generation capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).
