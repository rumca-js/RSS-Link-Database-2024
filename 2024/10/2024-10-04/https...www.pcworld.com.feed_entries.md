<p>Whether you want to get into better shape or just want accurate health reports without having to wear a smartwatch, then getting an Oura Ring might be just the thing you need.</p>



<p>And now’s a great time to snag one because <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Oura-Ring-Gen3-Horizon-Tracking/dp/B0CSRG88GT/">this Oura Ring Gen3 Horizon is on sale for $300 on Amazon</a>, which is $50 off its MSRP. That may not seem like a discount to blow you away, but Oura Rings rarely go on sale — and when they do, they rarely drop this much.</p>



<p>The Oura Ring is a tiny little device that’s packed with sensors to track your biometrics. And because it’s worn on your finger, it’s more accurate and personalized than, say, a smartwatch. How are your stress levels? Are you sleeping well? What’s your heart rate like across the day? Is your blood oxygen level in a good rang

<p>Wow, I feel like I’ve been seeing this monitor (or ones functionally identical to it, anyway) on sale a lot lately. But that doesn’t make it any less sweet. Today, Newegg is selling this Acer Nitro gaming monitor with a 27-inch IPS panel at a 1440p resolution and 180Hz refresh rate <a href="https://www.newegg.com/acer-vg271u-m3bmiipx-27-wqhd-144hz-using-hdmi-port-180hz-using-display-port-nitro-ips-black/p/N82E16824011467">for just $160</a>. That’s $110 off its regular price.</p>



<p>I’ll stop banging this drum when it stops making noise: If at all possible, you should opt for an IPS panel over a VA panel. The better color accuracy means you can use it for Photoshop (like I did in this very article), then switch over to <em>Fortnite</em> for gaming (which I did not do for this article. I promise, boss!). Now that these monitors are coming with higher refr

<p>Knowing you’re able to charge your phone at any time, no matter where you are, should lift a weight off your shoulders and put some pep in your step when you’re out and about.</p>



<p>That’s why you need a power bank, like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/INIU-High-Speed-Flashlight-Powerbank-Compatible/dp/B07CZDXDG8/">this Iniu power bank that’s on sale for just $18 on Amazon</a>, currently knocked down by 40 percent off its usual price. If you don’t have a power bank, this is a good one to snag.</p>



<p>For starters, it’s super slim and compact, able to fit in your palm or slip into your pocket with ease. It’s also super lightweight, coming in at just 0.44 pounds, so you’ll barely even know it’s there.</p>



<p>This Iniu power bank features an in/out USB-C port that delivers 15W of charging power, able to charge an iPhone in about 1.5 hours. It also h

<p>I can’t say I prefer using a controller for my PC gaming. In fact, 98 percent of my gaming is still done with a keyboard and mouse — there’s really nothing that remotely compares to them for accurate aiming.</p>



<p>That said, there are times when I play with one — like when I’m playing a platformer on my 65-inch TV. In that case, it’s much easier to kick back on my couch and relax with a gamepad in my hands. Who says you can’t have a console-like experience with a gaming PC?</p>



<p>The problem I’ve had in the past, though, is that some controllers have been a little finicky and haven’t worked for me from the get-go. I’ve discovered the key is to set them up properly in Steam first, to ensure they work in the games I want them to. Here’s how to do that…</p>

<p>Austria-based Noctua has become a fan favorite for its high-quality cooling products and understated style. The company has been banking on that goodwill to spread its silent wings into new product lines, like <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1448154/asuss-noctua-branded-rtx-4080-graphics-card-is-shockingly-gorgeous.html">partnering with Asus on brown graphics cards</a> and even making keycaps and a screwdriver.</p>



<p>The next new Noctua product will be a power supply. It’s coming sooner than you think, and — like the aforementioned Asus collaboration — Noctua isn’t making it in-house.</p>



<p>It’ll be made in partnership with Seasonic, with Noctua lending out its oh-so-quiet fans while getting a bit of input on the power supply’s looks. It’s a Seasonic Prime TX-1600W, to be precise. A monster 1600-watt, ATX 3.1-compliant power supply packing

<p>As October Prime Day approaches, we’re seeing more and more great deals on Amazon — like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blink-Outdoor-4th-Gen-3-Camera/dp/B0B1N5FK48/">this 3-pack of Blink Outdoor 4 wireless security cameras that’s now just $100</a>, which is 62 percent off MSRP.

<p>These Blink cameras are extremely easy to install despite needing to be mounted outdoors. Why? Because they’re wire-free! All you have to do is set them up on a wall somewhere, then connect them to Wi-Fi. (The included mounting kits use two screws each for fastening.)</p>

<p>Competitive gaming can feel like an Olympic-sized endeavor for many. It demands time, dedication, practice, grit, and mental fortitude. You have to cultivate success from many angles — and part of that involves making sure your network isn’t impeding your performance.</p>



<p>The best online esports gamer in the world with a top-tier gaming rig is still at the mercy of one vital bottleneck: <strong>network latency</strong>.</p>



<p>When playing competitively online, ping or lag or latency (whatever you want to call it) can turn a winning move into a disaster. You need every millisecond you can get for your reaction time and cat-like reflexes, otherwise your opponents will have an advantage over you.</p>



<p>As a competitive PC gamer myself, I know this all too well. Here are my best tips for how to lower your latency in online games, whether you’re a
