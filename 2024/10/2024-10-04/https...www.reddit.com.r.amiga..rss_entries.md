<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Just bought an a500 from eBay as untested as a project. To my surprise, it just worked! It&#39;s loaded with rust on the back and I hear dirt rattling around inside so it needs a good cleaning and general servicing. </p> <p>So question about modern disk solutions. What&#39;s good to get for some gaming? I&#39;ve never owned a gotek, is that the best option? Anything else I should be aware of? Any help is appreciated! Thanks in advance.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Lanky-Peak-2222"> /u/Lanky-Peak-2222 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1fw1slp/new_to_amiga_questions/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1fw1slp/new_to_amiga_questions/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Can anybody please help with this? I have an A500+, 1MB Ram, KS 2.04 and I&#39;m looking for the final version of Deluxe Galaga that will run on this ECS system. I found a v2.5 adf that has no music, and the v2.6 adf that I found gives me &quot;Not a DOS disk in device DF0&quot; message. The v2.5 one states that it is patched for KS1.3 and that I need to add a SETPATCH21 command to a startup file, but when I load the v2.5 disk in WB and click on it, there are no contents shown. Apologies, but I am new to the platform and it has proven difficult to get some things working as there seems to be a million permutations of images, roms and systems.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/deanodley"> /u/deanodley </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1fw1cu0/deluxe_galaga_question/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1fw1cu0/deluxe_galaga_qu
