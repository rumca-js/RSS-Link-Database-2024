<p>Square Enix’s multiplayer shooter <em>Foamstars </em>is moving to a free-to-play model. The four-player team multiplayer melee officially turned into a free game today on Sony’s PlayStation 4 and 5 meaning you also won’t need a PlayStation Plus subscription to play it, according to a posting on <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://support.na.square-enix.com/news.php?id=19278&amp;la=1&amp;n=2&amp;drt=1724734800&amp;tag=87d9005e3aa0690a5e94dc228934fdabf6edcc4a"><ins>the studio’s support page</ins></a>.</p>
<p>If you purchased the game before Square Enix’s price change, the studio will send you a free “Legacy Gift” that includes 12 exclusive color-variant Bubble Beastie skins, an exclusive Slide Board design and a “Legacy” title. You’ll need to keep an eye on <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://foamstars.square-enix-games.com/en-us/"><ins>the game’s official website</ins></a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://x.com/foamstarsgame?lang=en"><ins>X account</ins></a>

<p>Now you’ll be able to see the fruits of your destruction in a virtual environment as <em>Human Fall Flat</em> and its hapless, ham-handed hero head to the Meta Quest headsets and Steam VR on Halloween. Curve Games and No Brakes Games are also working on a version for the PSVR2 for a date yet to be announced.</p>

<p>Finding myself far from an outlet when my phone hits five percent makes me feel shaky. Luckily, part of my job is testing portable batteries so I usually have at least a few on hand. (The only hard part is remembering to bring one along.) I’ve spent the past year and a half testing more than two dozen units to figure out which are the best power banks for different scenarios — from a partial recharge for an iPhone to a massive laptop battery for working out in the field. People who travel or are simply forgetful will appreciate the benefit of having a little extra juice on hand, but as I’ve learned from my tests, they aren’t all winners. Here are the best power banks for just about every scenario.&nbsp;</p>

The “fall <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-prime-day/">Prime Day</a>” of sorts has served as the online retailer’s unofficial kickoff to the holiday shopping season for the past few years. We expect most of the deals to be Prime exclusives, meaning you must be an active Prime subscriber to get the discounts. There are always a couple of deals available for everyone, though, so it’s worth perusing Amazon’s site even if you don’t pay for Prime. It’s also worth doing so now because we’ve found a number of solid early Prime Day deals already available. These are the best of the bunch; we’ll be updating this post regularly in the lead-up to October Prime Day, so check back for the latest deals.</p>

In this episode, Devindra and Cherlynn chat about Microsoft's current AI priorities, and what it means for people with older PCs. Also, we discuss the death of HoloLens and Microsoft giving up on AR as Meta, Apple and even Snap build for an augmented reality future.</p>
