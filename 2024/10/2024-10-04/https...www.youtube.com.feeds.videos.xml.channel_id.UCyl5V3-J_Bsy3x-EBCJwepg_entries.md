In this episode of The Babylon Bee Podcast, J.D. Vance brings a hefty dose of "toxic masculinity" to the Vice Presidential debate, leaving Tim Walz with a look that says, "I didn't sign up for this." Meanwhile, The Babylon Bee decided to sue California over its dumb new "deepfake" law! On the international front, Iran figured it was a good time to lob some missiles at Israel, sparking a lively debate about whether the United States can afford interventionism. Finally, don't be surprised if your friendly neighborhood Christian pastor tells you it’s time for Kamala Harris and to not fight the culture war— because apparently, that’s where we’re at now.
