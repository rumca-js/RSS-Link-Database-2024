<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi, I got &quot;The Search for Planet X&quot; and really love it. The one issue is I win basically every time I play and I think it&#39;s turning people off it.</p> <p>I love the variable difficulty: being able to give newer players a starting advantage is a great idea but it doesn&#39;t seem to really help much in practice, me with 0 clues and them with 8+.</p> <p>So I&#39;m wondering if anyone has any other ways to level the playing field? I think there being almost no luck in this game makes it stand out as a problem more than other games. Ideally it would be something I could do on my own, I don&#39;t know how it will go if I announce I&#39;m not only playing on &quot;genius&quot; difficulty, but also adding more handicaps.</p> <p>I don&#39;t have this issue with everyone, some of my friends will beat me more often than not, but one friend said he has the same issue of winning all the time with his group.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted b

You&#39;re placing &quot;workers&quot; (action pawns) but they are obviously not traditional worker placement games because you don&#39;t execute your action right away.</p> <p>Both games have an initial phase where all players take turns selecting (in turn order, repeatedly) from a list of action spaces that is conveniently laid out on the game board itself. After all pawns have been placed, you move to the next phase, where those actions are executed in order (generally top to bottom, left to right) based on where everyone has placed their numerous pawns.</p> <p>Not only do I think this kind of stalled/plan-ahead mechanism to be a nice shake-up from traditional worker placement, but I&#39;ve also found it helps teach the game and better facilitates the flow of things, since you&#39;re literally working your way down a list that&#39;s right there in front of you.</p> <p><strong>Bus</strong>
