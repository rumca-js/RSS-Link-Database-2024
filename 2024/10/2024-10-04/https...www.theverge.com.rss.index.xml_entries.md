  <p id="tLCA4d">In February, Disney and Epic Games announced that they were collaborating on a “persistent universe” that would feature characters from Disney, Pixar, Marvel, <em>Star Wars</em>, and more.

  <p id="BD3daP">Rivian said it would make fewer electric vehicles this year than it did in 2023, resulting from a parts shortage. The news came as the company reported third quarter production and delivery numbers that came in below analyst expectations. </p>
<p id="SoXADw">Rivian says it <a href="https://rivian.com/newsroom/article/rivian-releases-q3-2024-production-and-delivery-figures">expects to produce between 47,000 and 49,000 vehicles</a> this year, down from the 57,000 vehicles it originally forecast.

  <p id="ecUGIl">Waymo has its sights set on its next robotaxi: the Hyundai Ioniq 5. </p>
<p id="rzswhB">The Alphabet company announced that it was entering a “multi-year, strategic” partnership with the Hyundai Motor Group that will result in the Ioniq 5 eventually joining its robotaxi fleet. </p>
<p id="KjClW5">But first, the Ioniq 5 will need to undergo on-road testing with Waymo’s self-driving technology, which the company says will begin in late 2025. Waymo wouldn’t specify when the Ioniq 5 will be used for passenger trips, except to say it would be “years” later.</p>
