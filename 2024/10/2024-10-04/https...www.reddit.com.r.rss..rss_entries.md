<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Now, I know this kind of defeats the purpose of an RSS feed. After all, we don’t need another algorithm controlling what we read or don’t read. But, bear with me.</p> <p>I believe the main problem with algorithms is when it starts to feed us from sources we don’t follow.</p> <p>I’d love to follow a list of sources (RSS feeds) I trust and provide content I’m generally interested in and have the algorithm curating and narrowing down a feed for me.</p> <p>For the sake of an example, let’s say i follow CNN and The Verge. They cover very broad topics but the algo will learn i’m mainly interested in EU news and Android.</p> <p>Is there anything out there that would help me get close to this? </p> <p>Even if it doesn’t learn specifically from me, maybe something that identifies and filter what’s more popular.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/gugavieira"> /u/gugavieira </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www

## RSS Feed WSJ Limitation with Inoreader

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Why am I not capturing all of the WSJ feeds directly through my RSS in Inoreader? I&#39;m a paid WSJ member and have access to their public RSS feeds for sections like Opinion, World News, U.S. News, Market News, Technology, and Lifestyle. According to their website, these are the available feeds, unless I’m missing something.</p> <p>Could someone help me understand why the WSJ app has so many more updates, but my RSS feed shows much less to almost none? Is there a way to ensure that I get all of their articles in Inoreader instead of using the WSJ app? I tried to fetch their website using a bot, but it blocks me.</p> <p>I manage several subscriptions and rely on my Inoreader RSS app to process between 1,000 and 5,000 articles a day. Switching between different news apps is not an option, as I need features like marking articles as read, tracking trending topics, filtering and removing duplicate, and more, which Inoreader does seamlessly. Any advice w

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I need an RSS recommendation for a very specific use case at work that I have a limited budget for. </p> <p>I want to be able monitor my top two competitors’ Google alerts, press, LinkedIn social posts and web blog posts and automated push into a Slack channel. So as soon as they push on social, the Slack channel posts the link to it or if they post a new blog etc. </p> <p>I’ve been using the RSS Slack app for the Google alerts but need to use something else for the blog post feeds, LinkedIn etc. </p> <p>Any suggestions? I can probably spend $2-500 for the year. I have no budget for a fancy competitive intelligence software. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/taleofbeedlebard"> /u/taleofbeedlebard </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1fvpnmy/rss_recommendation_for_competitive_monitoring/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1fvpnmy/
