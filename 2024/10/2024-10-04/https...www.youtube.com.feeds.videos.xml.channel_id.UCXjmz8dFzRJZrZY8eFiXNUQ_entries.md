Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings are considered some of the best adaptations ever put to film.  When Peter Jackson returned for The Hobbit, many fans were let down by the rushed production schedule, and hyper-glossy look of Middle Earth.  Now, working without source material, Amazon Studios Rings of Power has attempted to expand the mythos of Tolkiens works, but it has mostly fallen flat with audiences.  Rings of Power had an uphill battle from the start, but now with Season 2 all but wrapped up, it seems Lord of the Rings fans are still not enjoying the show.  Will anyone ever reach the heights of Peter Jacksons original Lord of the Rings trilogy?
