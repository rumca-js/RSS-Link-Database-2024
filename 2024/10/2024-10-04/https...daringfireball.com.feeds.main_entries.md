## Why Is Jack Smith’s Unsealed Motion, Outlining Trump’s Criminal Actions to Overturn the 2020 Election, Not the Top Story?

<p>Taegan Goddard, writing at Political Wire:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s worth recalling that a major reason Trump won in 2016 was
that, just before the election, news broke about emails related to
a closed investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails being found
on Anthony Weiner’s computer, the estranged husband of a top
Clinton aide.</p>

<p>In the end, nothing came of this discovery, but the extensive news
coverage of it <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/06/fbi-ignored-anthony-weiners-laptop-and-it-may-have-cost-hillary-clinton-the-election.html">almost certainly swayed the election</a>. It
was the top story in every major newspaper.</p>

<p>But this new evidence presented against Trump wasn’t even the lead
story in the <a href="https://d2dr22b2lm4tvw.cloudfront.net/ny_nyt/2024-10-03/front-page-large.jpg">New York Times</a> or <a href="https://d2dr22b2lm4tvw.cloudfront.net/dc_wp/2024-10-03/front-page-large.jpg">Washington Post</a>
this morning. And it didn’t even

<p>I missed this announcement from MLB a month ago:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Major League Baseball today announced a new multi-year
international partnership with European workwear leader STRAUSS
that makes the German company the Official Workwear Partner of
MLB. The partnership marks STRAUSS’ first league-wide deal in the
United States. STRAUSS entered the U.S. market in late 2023, and
American brand awareness is the cornerstone of its marketing
efforts. The new partnership also affords STRAUSS marketing rights
with MLB across Canada, Mexico and Europe. As part of the deal,
STRAUSS’ name and logo will adorn MLB batting helmets during the
Postseason and regular season games in Europe, as well as MiLB
batting helmets all season long, beginning in 2025.</p>

<p>But I <a href="https://www.threads.net/@gruber/post/DAr0_lSRkmg">couldn’t miss it</a> watching postseason games on TV this week: there’s a ridiculous-looking “Strauss” on both sides of every player’s batting helmet n

<p>Victoria Gomelsky, reporting with absurd credulity for The New York Times:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hodinkee, the watch enthusiast website based in Manhattan that has
helped spread the gospel of mechanical watchmaking since its
founding in 2008, has a new owner.</p>

<p>On Friday, the Watches of Switzerland Group, one of the world’s
largest watch retailers with more than 220 multibrand and brand
stores in Britain and the United States, announced that it had
acquired the media company, which includes a website, a magazine,
a brand partnerships division and an insurance business. Neither
company would disclose the terms of the deal. [...]</p>

<p>Both Mr. Clymer and Mr. Hurley said Hodinkee’s staff, which now
totals about 35 people, would remain intact and that its editorial
team would remain independent of Watches of Switzerland oversight.</p>

<p>“But at a point in time,” Mr. Hurley said, “when you click on the
Hodinkee Shop, you will see the full range of the product that
