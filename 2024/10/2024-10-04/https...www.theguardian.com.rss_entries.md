<p>Just as Leeds looked set to celebrate a statement victory, a horrendous error from goalkeeper Illan Meslier allowed substitute Alan Browne to pounce and secure the point that keeps Sunderland clear at the top of the Championship.</p><p>Along the way a crowd of 41,769 were thoroughly entertained by the River Wear and Régis Le Bris received a reminder that his exciting young Sunderland side remain a work in progress, while the pressure on Daniel Farke was eased by some wonderful wing play from Willy Gnonto.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/04/sunderland-leeds-championship-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<ul><li>Northampton 33-29 Harlequins</li><li>Sleightholme doubles up in Saints’ bonus-point win</li></ul><p>It was a helter-skelter Friday night under the lights at Franklin’s Gardens, where Northampton beat Harlequins 33-29 in an enjoyably entertaining game. It was set-up to be a showdown between England’s two likely fly-halves, Marcus and Fin Smith, but Quins’ injury crisis in the back three meant Marcus ended up starting at full-back for the club for the first time. So he was squaring off against George Furbank, instead. It ought to be a disservice to everyone else on the pitch to frame a game that way, but the unavoidable truth is that in this sort of form Marcus Smith does have a knack of hogging everyone’s attention.</p><p>The first half included the best of Marcus Smith’s game, and the worst of it too. He was at fault for Saints’ first try. He gathered a kick to the corner that had stopped just short of touch, and decided to try to run his way out of trouble. He ended up runnin

<p>Transferring sovereignty to Mauritius paves the way for some to return, but islanders need a voice, reparations and rights in the UK</p><p>More than five decades ago, Britain began forcibly displacing an entire Indigenous people from their Indian Ocean archipelago so that it could build a military base with the US.

<p>Minutes for players eligible for England are decreasing as the top-flight rapidly grows into a multinational league</p><p>More than two-thirds of the players who have played in the Women’s Super League so far this season represent overseas countries, as the English top-flight continues to be an increasingly globally facing league.</p><p>Of the 203 different players who have featured during a WSL match after two rounds of fixtures, only62 are eligible to play for England, or 30.5%, according to data collated by the Guardian. Players representing 33 different countries have been named in a matchday squad for a WSL fixture this season, with players representing 30 different countries having started at least one match.

Given that St James’ Park is situated right in the city centre there are strong arguments against moving, but its proximity to terraces of listed Georgian townhouses complicates the idea of expanding the capacity from 53,000 to around 65,000 at a cost of at least £800m. Nonetheless, Newcastle’s manager has warned the hierarchy of the danger of “losing something special”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/04/eddie-howe-wants-newcastle-to-stay-at-unique-st-james

<p>The 79-year-old trainer, who rarely speaks to the media, seeks more Longchamps glory while sticking to principles</p><p>When Jerry Bailey rode Arcangues, a 133-1 outsider, for André Fabre in the 1993 Breeders’ Cup Classic, he had no idea what the trainer looked like and could not find him in the pre-race scrum in the paddock. His initial ambition, he conceded later, was that he “just didn’t want to finish last”. But on the final turn for home, as <a href="https://youtu.be/tAz9K1gjUh4?si=j1cqZmYM7obZAOQC">he glided around the rail</a> travelling more like an odds-on favourite, Bailey was already raising his sights considerably higher. “I thought I had a chance to win it,” he told an interviewer years later. “But a lot of times, you’ll be sitting on a horse and you think you have a bunch left. And when you ask the question, the answer’s no.”</p><p>As Bailey was about to discover, when a horse is trained by Fabre, the answer is generally yes. A 53,000-strong crowd at Santa Anita was a

<p>Featuring peacock-shaped padlocks and a holographic Sufi master, a new museum explores the religion’s influence on Western culture – and leaves visitors wondering how the giant begging bowls were installed</p><p>Among the most emblematic paraphernalia of the Sufis is their “begging bowl”, known as the <em>kashkul</em>. That’s why nearly a dozen are at the centre of a new museum dedicated to Sufi culture and art, <a href="https://www.macsmto.fr/">the Musée d’Art et de Culture Soufis MTO</a>, which has just opened in Chatou, a quiet Parisian suburb on the banks of the Seine.</p><p>The kashkul is traditionally made from the nutshell of the coco de mer palm, the tree that produces the world’s biggest seed, and what makes it all the more remarkable is that it’s a fruit from Seychelles that historically washed up 4,000km away on Iran’s southern shores. The journey through the ocean made the shells extremely polished, which Sufis took as a symbol of the inner journey and cleansing the sou

<p>Here’s a starting point for a sweet, spiced snack. Take it in any direction with your favourite ingredients</p><p>I first tried trail mix in America, and quickly learned that no two are the same. Almost anything goes, with some containing just nuts and dried fruit, and others leaning more into candy territory with marshmallows and M&amp;M’s. This one falls somewhere in the middle: roast chickpeas, which I’ve sweetened with sugar and spices, are a great way to mix up your snacking, while some sort of chocolate is a must in my book. I’ve opted for chocolate-covered raisins, but dark chocolate chunks or chocolate pretzels would be great, too.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/oct/04/roast-chickpea-trail-mix-recipe-benjamina-ebuehi">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This joyful travelogue based on British folklore sees the writer/comic best known for playing Kurtan on hilarious form – even if it does blur the lines between artist and character</p><p>Charlie Cooper’s Myth Country is, in itself, a slight thing. A professed interest in Britain’s folklore – arising during the making of This Country, the actor and writer’s near-perfect comic and devastating creation with his sister Daisy May Cooper – sees him set off in a converted AA van to investigate some of our isle’s most famous legends. The first episode takes him to Norfolk to find out about Black Shuck, a ravening giant dog with burning red eyes who has roamed the flatlands of East Anglia since the middle ages. For the second he’s in Wiltshire talking to people who believe crop circles are the work of aliens or centres of spiritual energy. In the third, he’s on the trail of King Arthur’s treasure. And so on.</p><p>It would be gentle enough fun – half-hour gobbets of talking to a pleasurable

Paul Davis was about to inflict pain on both an opponent and his own future.</p><p>In September 1988, Arsenal found themselves trailing 2-0 at Highbury against Chris Nicholl’s Southampton. George Graham’s team looked condemned to another home defeat, having lost two weeks before to Aston Villa.

<p>Former England and Scotland coach is back where he began at Bath with a competitive edge still burning as Bristol visit</p><p>Few individuals, if any, are better qualified to discuss the ebb and flow of high-level coaching than Andy Robinson. Twenty years ago this month he was promoted to be England’s head coach with a World Cup medal and an OBE tucked away. If the subsequent two&nbsp;decades have reinforced anything it is that sport is about timing and resilience as much as milk and&nbsp;honey.</p><p>The man sitting across a cafe table in downtown Bath has been appointed to – and removed from – three head coaching jobs in international rugby in Europe, with England, Scotland and Romania.

Let’s begin with that first, then move on to this Japanese-influenced seafood restaurant’s delicate bowls of sea bass, amberjack and trout. Or at least try to, because there’s something about that name that’s <em>very</em> hard to let go. Albatross Death Cult sounds less like a restaurant and more like a patchouli oil-scented support band for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/my-bloody-valentine">My Bloody Valentine</a> or a sinister doomsday sect.

<p>As my horse<strong> </strong>galloped on to the main road, all I could do was hold on for dear life</p><p>The wind was rushing past my face. I clung on to the reins of the galloping horse.

It was a beautiful sunny day. The party was at a country house. There was a bouncy castle in the garden, and the screams of children inside filled the air.

<p>Cody Matthew Johnson explains how he has scoured every sonic corner, from spider monkeys’ chatter to gamelan, to write tunes a space travelling street thief would hear</p><p>Have you ever thought what walking into a sweaty, dusty club on one of Star Wars’ desert planets would sound like? About what plays on the radios in the casinos on those Las Vegas-like planets? What do the merchants and miscreants of Tatooine listen to when they’re not working the moisture farms or fending off Tusken Raiders? Pondering questions like that has been Cody Matthew Johnson’s life for the past few years. The composer and artist has flirted with video game music before, with credits on Devil May Cry, Resident Evil, Bayonetta, and the cult indie Kurosawa-inspired side-scroller, Trek to Yomi. But for Ubisoft’s Star Wars Outlaws, he was tasked with making music for its seedy criminal underbelly.</p><p>“There is a limited scope of in-world musical expression in the original trilogy, and this was our oppor

Attending as a fan can seem hard to justify on a weekend when I spend a day away from my young family to work at Anfield, Molineux or Turf Moor. I am not sure whether I am stereotypical of the industry; there are plenty desperate to take in as many matches as possible for work or pleasure.

<p>After reporting a high-profile journalist for sexual assault, Ito was championed and vilified. She relives that night and the aftermath in her documentary Black Box Diaries</p><p>When Shiori Ito arranged to meet Noriyuki Yamaguchi for dinner at a Tokyo <em>izakaya</em> (bar) in April 2015, she was hoping for advice on her fledgling career as a journalist and, perhaps, a recommendation for a job. Yamaguchi, the former Washington bureau chief of Tokyo Broadcasting System, a respected TV network, was well connected. He had written a favourable biography of the prime minister at the time, Shinzo Abe, whom he counted as a friend.</p><p>Instead, the meal would mark the start of Ito’s private hell. She tells of how, despite indicating she wished to go home, the then 26-year-old was piled into a taxi and taken to a hotel, where Yamaguchi, more than two decades her senior, raped her. Two years later, against the advice of her family and the authorities, Ito went public with her allegations,

<p>From a flourish of extra fabric at the top of a blouse to a dramatic necklace, extra details can take your look a long way</p><p>Fashion loves a new erogenous zone. Who can forget the entire red carpet season, a few years back, that was wall-to-wall sideboob with a few statuettes thrown in. Or the Britney and Christina years, when music videos and magazines were a montage of hipbones, out and proud above low-rise waistbands, like shark fins poking out of an ocean. There were seasons of Sex and the City that were love letters to toe cleavage. Not to mention the years, too many to mention, that have been in thrall to cleavage itself.</p><p>Well, now we have a new one. Right&nbsp;now, the erogenous zone of the catwalk is your neck.

<p>For many Israelis, the shedding of support since 7 October attack has revived a belief that they cannot rely on others</p><p>Israel’s first prime minister, David Ben-Gurion, famously said: “Our future does not depend on what the gentiles will say, but on what the Jews will do.” His argument was that the Jewish people could no longer be dependent on others as they had been for 2,000 years. Instead they were independent, self-reliant and creators of their own destiny.</p><p>Today, faced by mounting diplomatic isolation over its war in Gaza – to the extent that Israel is now seen by some nations as a pariah state – Ben-Gurion’s maxim has gained renewed traction for many Israelis.

There, with the tiling giving the room an echo and the sound of running taps generating white noise, he’d sit strumming his guitar in the dark. This experience inspired The Sound of Silence – Simon and Garfunkel’s first US No 1 – and one of pop’s most memorable opening couplets: “Hello darkness my old friend / I’ve come to talk with you again.”</p><p>“The Sound of Silence was the first song I wrote which seemed to come from some place that I didn’t inhabit,” says Simon, now 82, over the phone from the city where he penned it. “At age 23, it was unusual, well beyond my age and abilities.
