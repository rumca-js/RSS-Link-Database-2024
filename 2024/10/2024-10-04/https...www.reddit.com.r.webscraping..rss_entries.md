<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello everyone!</p> <p>Please I need some help understanding what would be the issue in my web scraper. The scraper is made with Node &amp; Puppeteer. The page I want to scrape is a public info page from the government (SSR response). Now, when I was testing it locally, I had some issues with <strong>Incapsula</strong>. I manage to work around the limitations with <code>puppeteer-extra</code> and <code>puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth</code>. Finally, I added a script to my instance which was recommended, this is the script:</p> <p><code>Object.defineProperty(navigator, &#39;webdriver&#39;, {get: () =&gt; false})</code></p> <p>The scrapper is working perfectly on the local environment. Since I wanted to deploy the application on the cloud I used <code>Docker</code> and deployed it on <code>Render</code>. Once deployed, the scrapper is not working, I&#39;m getting an HTML from the request which is not the expected.</p> <p><code>&lt;html style=&quot;heigh

I&#39;m looking for a recommendation on which web scraping tool can best fit the below requirements.</p> <p>The below snip is an example of what the page looks like at the end of each day (it is significantly longer than in the photo, perhaps 3x more lines of text). Unfortunately, the page refreshes every morning and I don&#39;t always get the chance to review it at the end of each day. I would require the tool to scrape the page at say 9:00pm each night (to ensure it captures all the information) then send me the results via email/
