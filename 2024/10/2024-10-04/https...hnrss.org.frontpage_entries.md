<p>I would very much like to transition to doing more embedded type software that is closer to interfacing directly with hardware, but my only experience in this has been writing code for Arduino, different Raspberry Pi flavors, and sometimes the ESP8266.<p>I really enjoy doing these kinds of projects but through all the effort of making it as easy as possible for people to write, compile, and use code on these embedded chips I've never gotten the sense that people would be willing to pay me to do similar type of work.<p>I'm not under the impression that writing firmware or doing lower level programming is all like this, so I would like to hear what kinds of projects and challenges people who may have actually been employed doing work like this have come across. Was it interesting work? Is this type of software engineering in demand?</p>

## Show HN: FFmpeg-over-IP – Connect to remote FFmpeg servers

<p>Dear HN,<p>I’m excited to show case a personal project. It has helped me quite a bit with my home lab, I hope it can help you with yours too! ffmpeg-over-ip has two components, a server and a client. You can run the server in an environment with access to a GPU and a locally installed version of ffmpeg, the client only needs network access to the server and no GPU or ffmpeg locally.<p>Both and client and the server need a shared filesystem for this to work (so the server can write output to it, and client can read from it). In my usecase, smb works well if your (GPU) server is a windows machine, nfs works really well for linux setups.<p>This utility can be useful in a number of scenarios:<p>- You find passing through a (v)GPU to your virtual machines complicated<p>- You want to use the same GPU for ffmpeg in multiple virtual machines<p>- Your server has a weak GPU so you want to use the GPU from your gaming machine<p>- Your GPU drivers in one OS are not as good as another (AMD RX6

## Show HN: open source framework OpenAI uses for Advanced Voice

 - date published: 2024-10-04T17:01:04+00:00


<p>Hey HN, we've been working with OpenAI for the past few months on the new Realtime API.<p>The goal is to give everyone access to the same stack that underpins Advanced Voice in the ChatGPT app.<p>Under the hood it works like this:
- A user's speech is captured by a LiveKit client SDK in the ChatGPT app
- Their speech is streamed using WebRTC to OpenAI’s voice agent
- The agent relays the speech prompt over websocket to GPT-4o
- GPT-4o runs inference and streams speech packets (over websocket) back to the agent
- The agent relays generated speech using WebRTC back to the user’s device<p>The Realtime API that OpenAI launched is the websocket interface to GPT-4o. This backend framework covers the voice agent portion. Besides having additional logic like function calling, the agent fundamentally proxies WebRTC to websocket.<p>The reason for this is because websocket isn’t the best choice for client-server communication. The vast majority of packet loss occurs between a server and clie

<p>Hey HN, I'm Nate, the creator of Tamagui.<p>One is a React framework that does two things differently in hopes of simplifying how we build websites and apps:<p>1. It unifies React Native and React web with typed file system routing by making Vite able to serve RN. This lets you share (or diverge) your code in a simpler way for cross-platform apps.<p>2. We've partnered with Zero (<a href="https://zerosync.dev" rel="nofollow">https://zerosync.dev</a>) to make local-first work well. We've been building a solution in One that makes Zero supporting server rendering, without waterfalls, and with seamless server/client handoff.<p>---<p>Honestly - I'm a bit hesitant to post One here.<p>HN has really soured on frontend/frameworks. And I get it. We've collectively complicated the hell out of things.<p>That's why I decided to build One. I loved Rails, it made me as a young developer able to finally realize way more ambitious projects than I'd ever done before. I also liked the promise (not i

## Show HN: kew – A Terminal Music Player for Linux

<p>Hi HN,<p>I created kew, a music player for the Linux terminal.<p>This started when I asked myself: what if I could just type something like "play nirvana" in the terminal and have the rest taken care of automatically? That got the ball rolling and I kept adding stuff: covers in ascii and then as sixel images, a playlist view, a visualizer, a library view and finally search.<p>While kew can be used as a commandline tool, it has evolved into a TUI app.<p>Here are some example commands:<p>kew nirvana     # Plays all of your Nirvana songs, shuffled<p>kew nevermind   # Plays the "Nevermind" album in order<p>kew spirit  # Plays "Smells Like Teen Spirit"<p>kew all         # Plays all your music, shuffled<p>kew albums      # Plays one album after the other in random order<p>It works best when your music library is organized like this:
Artist/Album(s)/Track(s)<p>kew is written in C and licensed under GPLv2.<p>Source and screenshot: <a href="https://github.com/ravachol/kew">https://github.c

## Show HN: Chebyshev approximation calculator (open source web app)

<p>Hi everyone,<p>here's a web app I made that generates code for efficiently approximating mathematical functions. This is useful when performance matters more than perfect accuracy, for example in embedded systems.<p>The app uses Chebyshev expansions, which despite their theoretical depth result in suprisingly compact and readable code in practice. This code is generated for you and using it does not require any knowledge of the underlying theory.<p>Source code and more info:
