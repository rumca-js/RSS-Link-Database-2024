Lightning Talk: RISC-V and AI: How an Open-Standards ISA Underpins Portability for AI/ML Applications - Philipp Tomsich, VRULL GmbH

RISC-V, an open-standards Instruction Set Architecture (ISA), provides the freedom to add instructions for domain-specific acceleration. This session highlights the significance of ongoing standardization efforts at RISC-V aimed at enhancing AI/ML capabilities through specific architectural enhancements: optimized instructions for matrix operations, efforts to merge GPGPU-style processing into a coherent, multi-paradigm compute resource, and support for emerging paradigms like spiking neural networks. This positions RISC-V to become a "lingua franca" for portable AI/ML libraries and kernels that can transparently be moved between compatible hardware from multiple vendors.

Panel: Why Open Source AI Matters for Europe - Justin Colannino, Sachiko Muto, Stefano Maffulli, Cailean Osborne

Open source brings the promise of an AI market that is decentralised, competitive, user-centric, and where Europe leads. With this explosion, open source communities and policymakers are asking questions about open source AI’s innovation benefits, safety risks, impact on sovereignty, and competitive economics against closed-source models. In this fireside chat, OSI board member and Microsoft open source lawyer Justin Colannino will interview OFE's Sachiko Muto, OSI's Stefano Maffulli, and LF’s Cailean Osborne about why a clear and consistent definition of open source AI matters for open source communities in the face of growing EU policy tending towards greater open source regulation. We will focus on how truly “open source” in AI manifests in practice and how can it be can bolster European competitiveness while keeping true to all of our open source values.

Lightning Talk: Building the AIverse: Standardizing Autonomous AI Agents for a Decentralized Fediverse - Chris Xie, Futurewei

The decentralized fediverse is poised to revolutionize how we interact online, but it still lacks a crucial component: standardized, interoperable AI agents. Current AI agent frameworks are numerous, but fragmented, leading to inefficiencies and duplication of effort. This talk proposes a future vision where decentralized fediverse is empowered by standardized, autonomous AI agents with human-in-the-loop, enhancing our daily lives both online and offline. We'll discuss the need for a standard architecture for AI agent frameworks, incorporating AI safety rules and sustainable development principles, to ensure the new "AIverse" is built responsibly and sustainably. Join us in exploring how this vision can become a reality.

Reducing Bias in AI with Open Source - Abubakar Siddiq Ango, GitLab

Bias in AI has become a hot topic and increasingly, we are seeing how dangerous it is. Dangerous because AI is gain more influence in decisions that impact lives, decisions about who gets employment, healthcare or economic development and who gets profiled for crime, extra search at the airport, and so on. Even tools designed to identify AI-generated content have shown bias against non-native speakers based on their choice of verbiage. To reduce bias, experts often refer to having diverse training data and cognitive diversity, but where else is this achievable than in Open-source communities? This session is designed to open up discussions around reducing bias in AI with Open source. Abubakar will start by sharing examples of biases, sharing strategies to leverage open-source communities, and opening the floor for attendees to share their opinions and views, with the goal of creating a resource that will be valuable

Learning by Example: Highlights from Google Season of Docs - Erin McKean, Google

The Google Season of Docs program gives direct grants to open source projects to hire technical writers. The technical writing projects supported by these grants are intended to solve real problems for open source project communities, and the case studies created by the projects are intended to help other open source projects learn how to conceptualize and create their own problem-solving open source documentation. In this talk, we'll walk through how projects participating in Google's Season of Docs program have framed their problems, hypothesized solutions, created documentation to solve those problems, and measured the success of their documentation.
