Super Mario Bros. Movie 2 will apparently be delving deep into the series' mythology, with one of its returning cast members recently teasing an "intriguing" setting, plus characters including "old favourites" and "really deep cuts" - and if that doesn't include Birdo, I will riot.

Made by just a two person team, developer Pounce Light has crafted a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tiny-glade-is-all-about-making-ruins">simple and charming gameplay loop</a>: make, create, and arrange castles, villas, or cottages to your liking using the game's flexible building system. It may be cozycore on the surface, but there's plenty of bespoke stuff driving its warm pastel aesthetic, including ray-traced global illumination (RTGI), ray-traced reflections and loads of procedural tech. Impressively, it all runs really well on near-decade-old GPUs too. RT on a GTX 1060? Believe it.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-tiny-glade-proves-the-power-of-bespoke-game-eng

Shadows of Doubt is, on paper, my dream game, a detective simulator where you solve procedurally generated crimes through a combination of Obra Dinn-esque deduction and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/deus-ex">Deus Ex</a> style infiltrations. In a fully simulated city of hundreds of citizens, you solve thefts, murders, and kidnappings by legally or illegally entering homes and offices, scanning for fingerprints, searching for clues, and cross-referencing dizzying amounts of information to track down the culprit.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shadows-of-doubt-review-an-unmatched-detective-similation-when-it-works">Read more</a></p>

Sign me the heck up. This is Last Time I Saw You, a coming of age tale about middle schooler Ayumi who keeps seeing a mysterious girl in his dreams, but can never quite glimpse her face. It will only take you 20 minutes or so to play through its current Steam demo, but even this short glimpse into the game's opening chapter feels like a strong show of intent from developer Maboroshi Artworks.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/japanese-teen-drama-last-time-i-saw-you-channels-the-spirit-of-night-in-the-woods-with-its-killer-opening">Read more</a></p>
