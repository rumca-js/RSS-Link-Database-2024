<p>Dementia is the highest cause of death in the UK, says the Naked Attraction host – whose father has been diagnosed. This is a moving, scary look at the condition</p><p>Seeing someone suffer from dementia is extremely painful. My hope, as I watched people struggle with the condition, was that, as hard as it was to see them lost and confused within the prism of their own mind, perhaps they might not have been as acutely aware of the tragedy of their circumstances as those of us around them. That thought made it a little easier to bear.</p><p>Dementia will, at some point, affect every one of us in some way. As Anna Richardson’s Channel 4 documentary lays out, it is the highest cause of death in the UK and, as the presenter grimly states, it’s predicted that a third of us will develop it in our lifetimes.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/oct/02/anna-richardson-love-loss-dementia-review-naked-attraction-host">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>PC, Xbox; Bethesda Softworks<br></strong>Bethesda’s gigantic space RPG’s first major expansion only highlights the game’s fundamental limitations<strong><br></strong></p><p>The first story expansion for Bethesda’s big, bold, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/sep/06/starfield-review-an-exquisite-electric-faintly-rickety-universe-of-possibilities">rickety</a> space RPG arrives after a year’s worth of incremental updates that have already ironed out the game’s most egregious flaws. Those quest-breaking bugs have been squished, there are now vehicles to make planet-side travel less of a chore, city maps are at least partly useful these days, and there’s now a 60fps mode for those playing on Xbox Series X. But Starfield’s fundamental problems remain – turgid, rubbery NPCs; the baffling profusion of loading screens – but just as the Phantom Liberty expansion finessed Cyberpunk 2077 in its entirety, Shattered Space arrives poised to improve upon what came before.</p>
