<blockquote>
  <p>Technology reporter Taylor Lorenz said Tuesday that she is leaving The Washington Post, less than two months after the newspaper launched an internal review following her social media post about President Joe Biden.</p>

<p>Lorenz, a well-regarded expert on internet culture, wrote a book “Extremely Online” last year and said she is launching a newsletter, “User Mag,” on Substack.</p>

She didn’t “exit” the Post. She was obviously and rightfully fired.</p>
