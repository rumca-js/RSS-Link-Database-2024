<p></p><p>As returns to the biggest club stage go, Aston Villa’s went rather swimmingly, the substitute Jhon Durán nonchalantly putting Bayern Munich to bed with a stunning, off-the-cuff left-foot lob. This was a night that guaranteed a sense of mystique regardless of result – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/sep/04/champions-league-aston-villa-ticket-prices-supporters-trust">despite well-documented prices</a> it was the hottest ticket in town and as the Champions League anthem filled the Villa Park air for the first time, the home support seemed to open their ears to drink it all in – but few anticipated Unai Emery’s side dispatching the Bundesliga giants in such style.</p><p>Durán is building quite the showreel. Pau Torres had a first-half goal disallowed for offside but Durán stepped off the bench to earn Villa victory, prompting Prince William off his feet to cheer from the stands, and maintain their 100% start to this competition. After 41 years away, th

<p>There will be tougher tests to come, as Arne Slot frequently likes to remind Liverpool, but there is no disputing the confidence, quality and momentum that is surging through this team under the guidance of its new head coach. Slot became the first Liverpool manager or head coach in history to record eight victories from his first nine matches in charge as Bologna were dispatched in a hard-fought contest at Anfield.</p><p>Alexis Mac Allister marked his first Champions League home game for Liverpool with his first goal of the season. Mohamed Salah quashed Bologna’s growing hopes of a point with a stunning second half strike to extend his European goalscoring record for the club on Liverpool’s 250th appearance in the Champions League/European Cup. New leader, new era this may be, but Liverpool’s authority on the European stage remains unchanged.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/02/liverpool-bologna-champions-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

Iris, played with a natural grace by Naomi Watts in The Friend, is not that type of person. She is a mostly solitary writer in a small – at least, to the eyes of her more accomplished peers – apartment in the West Village, whose schedule is at the whims of her teaching work and sputtering attempts at a novel. She has settled into an independent rhythm of middle-aged singledom in the city. Also, she prefers cats. Nevertheless, she finds herself caring for Apollo, her late best friend Walter’s (Bill Murray) beloved great dane, after his suicide.</p><p>The Friend, a slight and tender-hearted adaptation of Sigrid Nunez’s bestselling 2018 novel, opens with the scene of an abandoned Apoll

<p>The latest set of found-footage and alien tales packs together a Bollywood witch with a terrifying birthday treat and some very sinister dog daycare</p><p>Not counting a couple of spin-offs, this is the seventh feature in the V/H/S horror franchise, which since the first edition in 2012 have packaged together short films by different directors to tell creepy tales involving found footage or aliens (or both) as well as lots and lots of gore. Usually anything this many generations into its evolution is pretty exhausted – but this is pretty good, or at least in parts. It probably helps that Brad Miska, the producer behind the original concept, is still involved. More importantly, Miska has kept things fresh by finding new directors and writers for each edition, some of whom have gone on to make films on a bigger scale (such as Joe Swanberg, Ti West and Adam Wingard, all of whom contributed to the first V/H/S) or came aboard after having already become relatively successful just for th

Upstairs, Nintendo’s many video game consoles, from 1983’s Famicom through 1996’s Nintendo 64 to 2017’s Switch, are displayed reverently alongside their most famous games. On the back wall, visitors can also peer at toys, playing cards and other artefacts from the Japanese company’s pre-video-game history, stretching back to its founding as a <em>hanafuda</em><em> </em>playing card manufacturer in 1889.

JD Vance, the Ohio senator and Donald Trump’s running mate, clearly set out to make himself seem less creepy at Tuesday night’s vice-presidential debate, and a major target of this project was aimed at convincing women voters to like him. Vance, after all, has what pollsters call “<a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/favorability/jd-vance/">high unfavorables</a>”, which is a polite way of saying that people hate his guts.</p><p>Much of this stems from Vance’s extreme and inflexible views on abortion, his hostility to childless women, and his creepy statements about families and childrearing.

And yes, it certainly is about her, but it’s almost as if everyone involved – Gabeira, people who were supposedly her closest associates, and even the director Stephanie Johnes – aren’t quite conscious of the fact that they’re also making a documentary about endemic sexism in sport. You can almost see awareness of that latter theme coming to mind in the last half of the film, when Maya goes to battle with the organisation that’s meant to champion athletes in her field but which seemingly closes ranks against her lest her achievement makes that of her male peers seem less impressive.

<p>Helping someone to die should only be a very last resort, not a normalised part of our healthcare system</p><p>Thoughts of ending your life are a common response to human suffering. Yet with care and support, they can usually be overcome. That’s why our usual reaction to someone wanting to end their life is to try to prevent suicide – including showing them we value their life at a time when they’re struggling to do so themselves. Lord Falconer’s <a href="https://bills.parliament.uk/publications/55997/documents/4978">assisted dying bill</a>, which will soon be debated in the House of Lords, represents a radical departure from this approach: it proposes circumstances in which we <em>should</em> assist someone to end their life, rather than try to prevent them from doing so. But what circumstances could warrant this?</p><p>For Lord Falconer, the answer is simple: terminal illness. In his bill, as long as someone has mental capacity and is likely to have less than an arbitrarily chose

Crowned champions of Italy in 1985, an achievement that remains one of the greatest sporting upsets of all time, I have recently been speaking to the players involved with a book to follow next year to commemorate the 40th anniversary.

<p>Book three in the Norwegian novelist’s Morning Star series takes in devils, black metal and revelation, and provides a masterclass in what fiction can offer</p><p>“Signs are taken for wonders,” TS&nbsp;Eliot’s speaker observes soberly in Gerontion. But what is the difference between a wonder and a sign – and which do we prefer? Such questions flow through Karl Ove Knausgård’s Morning Star series of novels, an ongoing effort to open fiction up into a kind of vast Book of Revelation in which visions of red deer, landlocked crabs and devils stream across a rural Norway populated by Knausgård’s familiar hotel bars and supermarkets.</p><p>In the first volume, 2021’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/oct/01/the-morning-star-by-karl-ove-knausgard-review-bloated-and-inconsequential">The Morning Star</a>, a disparate group of Knausgårdian characters – a jaded academic with a manic-depressive wife, a doubting vicar with a jealous husband – found their lives illuminated and sent

<p>Cimarons, the UK’s first reggae band, played with Jimmy Cliff and Bob Marley but barely made a penny; this heartwarming film follows their first gig in 30 years</p><p>The UK’s first reggae band deserves all the love and attention coming their way with the release of this documentary. It’s the untold story of Cimarons, and begins in 1967 at a bus stop in London’s Harlesden where two Jamaican-born Londoners, Locksley Gichie and Franklyn Dunn, met and formed a band. By the end of the decade Cimarons would become the go-to backing group for Jamaican artists touring the UK, playing with the likes of Jimmy Cliff and Bob Marley. The band recorded albums of their own, worked as session musicians for Trojan records and toured with the Clash and the Jam. “They were the spark that started a big flame” is how MC General Levy describes their influence. But they barely made a penny out of music. Today, the band’s singer Michael Arkk works as an officer cleaner. How did Cimarons become reggae’s f

<p>The disappointment was fairly crushing as a kid. But I wouldn’t swap Daniel Radcliffe’s £95m fortune for my happily anonymous teenage years</p><p>In hindsight, the quiff was probably a bad idea. It was the morning of my final audition to play Harry Potter in 2000. I should have been rehearsing the scene I’d be performing later that day at Leavesden Studios, in front of a panel that included director Chris Columbus. Instead, I spent half an hour papier-macheing my fringe with fistfuls of wet-look hair gel, intent on giving these Hollywood bigwigs some of the old razzle dazzle.</p><p>Needless to say, securing the lead role in one of the biggest film franchises of all time requires more than a hairstyle.

<p>Farce-heavy humour and dark crime caper fuse in this German series’ chronicle of a couple’s desperate search for their 17-year-old daughter. It’s thrilling, poignant and funny –  if not revolutionary</p><p>With its jaunty alliteration and on-the-nose allusion to the iconic puzzle books, it’s clear from the outset that Where’s Wanda is not going to be an entirely serious missing-person drama. Apple TV’s first original German-language series chronicles Dedo and Carlotta Klatt’s desperate and increasingly illegal search for their 17-year-old daughter: it has been months since she disappeared, and day 100 – the point at which the chances of finding her alive tumble to just 10% – is on the horizon. Yet, the Klatts’ nightmare soon becomes a farcical caper, as they decide their best bet is to surreptitiously bug all the houses in their (mercifully tiny) home town of Sundersheim to check if their daughter is being held captive. Cue outlandish lies, ridiculous distraction techniques and a s
