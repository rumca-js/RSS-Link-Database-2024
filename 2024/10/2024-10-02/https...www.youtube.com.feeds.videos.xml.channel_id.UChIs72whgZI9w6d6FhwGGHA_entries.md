There were a ton of leaks and rumors the last 2 weeks in news, but also plenty of hardware news. This included X870 releases (and tons of "AI" obsession), the new Meta Quest, a 2200W Seasonic PSU, and more. We'll also cover rumors of the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 specs. These are not yet confirmed, but have hit the news circuit. Intel Battlemage also hit the rumor mill, alongside stories of Valve working on ARM64 support.
