<p>One of the year’s scariest and most engrossing horror games is clawing its way to a new console. SFB Games’ <em>Crow Country</em> will launch on the Nintendo Switch <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://neonhive-newsroom.prezly.com/return-to-one-of-the-best-horror-games-of-the-year-when-crow-country-launches-on-switch-this-october"><ins>on October 16</ins></a>.</p>
<p><em>Crow Country</em> may look like a cheerier, grainier <em>Animal Crossing</em> but that just adds to the horror adventure’s creepy and dark atmosphere. You play as Mara Forest, a plucky young woman exploring the remains of an abandoned amusement park called Crow Country. Its owner Edward Crow mysteriously disappeared in his park and has been missing for two years. It’s up to Mara to uncover the mysteries behind the abandoned theme park and its long lost owner.</p>

<p>Can you hear the soft, cherubic voices of corporate executives singing in unison? That can only mean one thing. They’ve figured out a new way to squeeze money out of our eyeballs.

<p>Believe it or not, Bose hasn’t been in the noise-canceling earbuds game very long. The company’s first ANC model arrived <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/bose-quietcomfort-earbuds-review-144502194.html"><ins>in late 2020</ins></a>, with two more to follow in <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/bose-quietcomfort-earbuds-2-review-130026306.html"><ins>2022</ins></a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/bose-quietcomfort-ultra-earbuds-review-spatial-audio-makes-all-the-difference-140057701.html"><ins>2023</ins></a>. It successfully brought its powerful active noise cancellation (ANC) tech to the true wireless form factor from the jump, but has further improved with each new version. And perhaps the company’s greatest earbud triumph thus far was the debut of <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/bose-debuts-quietcomfort-ultra-headphones-and-earbuds-with-spatial-audio-183032611.html"><ins>Imme

<p>Since 2022, Amazon has held a second Prime Day of sorts in October and that sale event is coming back this year, too. Prime Big Deal Days returns on <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/deals/amazon-announces-the-return-of-prime-big-deal-days-on-october-8-and-9-050356758.html">October 8 and 9</a>, but we’re already starting to see some decent deals pop up across Amazon’s site.</p>
<p>As per usual, most of the deals we expected to see on <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-prime-day/">October Prime Day</a> will be exclusively for Prime members — and some of the early Prime Day deals we’re seeing now have followed suit.

<p><a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/palworld/"><em><ins>Palworld</ins></em></a> could be on its way to a mobile device near you. Krafton, the publisher of <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/pubg/"><em><ins>PUBG: Battlegrounds</ins></em></a>, has agreed a licensing deal with the game’s maker, Pocketpair, to bring the smash hit to mobile.</p>
<p>Krafton’s PUBG Studios will develop the mobile version. No other details have been announced, other than to note that PUBG Studios will “reinterpret” <em>Palworld</em>’s gameplay for mobile devices, per an automated translation of a press release (which is <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.krafton.com/news/press/%ed%81%ac%eb%9e%98%ed%94%84%ed%86%a4-%ed%8c%b0%ec%9b%94%eb%93%9c-%eb%aa%a8%eb%b0%94%ec%9d%bc-%ea%b2%8c%ec%9e%84-%ea%b8%80%eb%a1%9c%eb%b2%8c-%eb%9d%bc%ec%9d%b4%ec%84%a0%ec%8a%a4/"><ins>in Korean</ins></a>).

<p>You'd think making a good digital picture frame would be easy. All you need is a good screen and a seamless way to get images to the device. Combine that with an inoffensive, frame-like design and you're good to go.<br><br>Despite that, Amazon is positively littered with scads of digital photo frames and I can tell you that many of them are awful. It's basically the 2020s version of what we saw with knock-off iPods back in the 2000s. There are loads of options that draw you in with a low price but deliver a totally subpar experience that will prompt you to shove the thing in a drawer and forget about it.<br><br>The good news is that you only need to find one smart photo frame that works. From there, you can have a pretty delightful experience. If you're anything like me, you have thousands of photos on your phone of friends, family, pets, vacation spots, perhaps some lattes or plates of pasta and much more. Too often, those photos stay siloed on our phones, not shared with others o

The company has no plans for a follow-up device, telling customers this will be the last chance to purchase the headset before stock runs out. At launch, it was advertised as a device for enterprise consumers, so it never really entered the mass market. The move isn’t that surprising, considering Microsoft scrapped plans for a HoloLens 3 headset back in 2022. We’re waiting for the official line from the company.</p>
<p>It’s not exactly indicative of a death knell for VR and AR, though.

<p>Licensing content from their vast libraries and back catalogs is how Hollywood studios make money. A TV show or movie that's on Max in the US may be on a totally different service in the UK or Korea, with the studio pocketing the extra pounds or won in the process. That’s why savvy viewers have long used VPNs – virtual private networks – to expand their options. Change your location from the US to the UK and, voila, you suddenly have access to <em>Friends</em> and <em>The Office</em> on Netflix again.</p>
<p>That’s great if you’re watching on a phone, tablet or PC, where installing and activating a VPN is as generally as simple as visiting the device’s app store. But streaming through a VPN is a bit more challenging on a TV. Thankfully, there are quite a few ways to get that VPN-filtered content on the biggest screen in your home. Below, we’ll walk you through unlocking geo-blocked content on your TV.</p>
<p>If you don’t already have a VPN subscription, we’d suggest choosing a serv

<p>Whether you’ve got a brand-new iPad or are still rocking an older model, investing in a good case is one of the best ways to protect your device. After all, an iPad is a versatile device that can go everywhere with you, making it more prone to the occasional drop, scratch or spill. And if you have kids, accidents are more likely than not! A case acts as an extra layer of defense, helping keep your iPad safe from the bumps and bruises of daily life. But it’s not just about protection — many iPad cases come with extra features that make your tablet even more useful. From stands that prop up your screen for easy viewing to keyboard cases that turn your iPad into a mini laptop, the right case can change your experience.

## The best E Ink tablets for 2024

<p>E-Ink tablets have always been intriguing to me because I’m a longtime lover of pen and paper. I’ve had probably hundreds of notebooks over the years, serving as repositories for my story ideas, to-do lists, meeting notes and everything in between. However, I turned away from physical notebooks at a certain point because it was just easier to store everything digitally so I always had my most important information at my fingertips.<br><br>E-Ink tablets seem to provide the best of both worlds: the tactile satisfaction of regular notebooks with many of the conveniences found in digital tools, plus easy-on-the-eyes E-Ink screens. These devices have come a long way in the past few years, and we’re just starting to see more color E-Ink tablets become more widely available. I tested out a number of different E Ink tablets to see how well they work, how convenient they really are and which are the best tablets using E Ink screens available today.</p>

<p>Women of color running for Congress in 2024 have faced a disproportionate number of attacks on X compared with other candidates, according to a new report from the nonprofit Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT) and the University of Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>The report sought to “compare the levels of offensive speech and hate speech that different groups of Congressional candidates are targeted with based on race and gender, with a particular emphasis on women of color.” To do this, the report’s authors analyzed 800,000 tweets that covered a three-month period between May 20 and August 23 of this year. That dataset represented all posts mentioning a candidate running for Congress with an account on X.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The report’s authors found that more than 20 percent of posts directed at Black and Asian women candidates “contained offensive language about the candidate.” It also found that Black women in particular were targeted with hate speech more o
