Mentor: Andrea Righi, Principal Software Engineer, NVIDIA

A significant portion of kernel development time is usually dedicated to testing and debugging kernels, a process that can be frustratingly slow.

Unlike user-space applications, where a fast edit/compile/test cycle is common, kernel testing requires deploying a test system (either bare-metal or VM), installing the recompiled kernel, running tests, collecting results, and then repeating the process. Bugs can further delay this process, often requiring reboots or even system redeployments.

virtme-ng aims to provide a standardized way for kernel developers to expedite the edit/compile/test cycle. It leverages QEMU/KVM, virtiofs, and overlayfs to boot a recompiled kernel (or any kernel image) inside a virtualized copy-on-write (CoW) live snapshot of the current system.

This approach allows developers to simply "fork" their system with a new kernel, creating a secure sandbox for testing that offers performance close to native ex
