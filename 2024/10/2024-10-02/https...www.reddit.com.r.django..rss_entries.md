Should it be running on both ports like that? When I add something to the template, it does not hot reload and I have to reload <code>localhost:8000</code> to see the changes. Does that mean <code>{% vite_hmr_client %}</code> is not working?</p> <p>Here is my <code>index.html</code> which runs on port 8000. It is just a blank page with <code>Test</cod

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have a project where users would occasionally (coupleof times a month) upload large files for later async processing via Celery Workers (Django app and Celery Worker both running in separate Docker containers, on the same host).<br/> The file would be uploaded during the day, stored in the DB using FileField, then processed overnight and deleted.</p> <p>My question is mainly relating to performance. S3 is obviously a better solution overall, but these files are large enough (few GB in size) and I only need to store them for less than 24 hours until they&#39;re processed by a nightly Celery task.</p> <p>I&#39;m considering storing them in a shared Docker volume that both the Django and the Celery worker containers can access might be better (faster IO) for this use case, but maybe the performance loss would be negligible with S3, I&#39;m not sure.</p> <p>I would appreciate feedback from anyone who has any experience in working with large files in S3.
