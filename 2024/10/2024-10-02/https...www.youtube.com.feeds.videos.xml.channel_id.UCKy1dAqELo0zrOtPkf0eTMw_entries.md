Microsoft is gonna start looking into why game devs aren’t prioritizing its console, the Xbox Series, over PS5 when deciding what platforms their games should be on.in relation to bringing their games to its console. In a developer blog, Microsoft announced that it’ll be directly engaging with game creators to hopefully enhance the experience between the corporation and development partners. Seems like many game devs have been putting the Xbox consoles on the back burner due to certain struggles game devs have experienced with the #Xbox ecosystem. One major example that comes to mind is Baldur’s Gate 3, which was delayed on Xbox series consoles due to the Series S being unable to run the split-screen multiplayer option. Many other developers have publicly expressed their concerns with Xbox which led to them having to delay their games. Entoria: The Last Song experienced quite the delay allegedly due to Microsoft taking too long to communicate with the studio developing the game.due to

Having inherited their Aunt Kate’s house, Riley Park starts exploring what the reclusive woman left behind. In the attic, Riley is surprised to find a stack of VHS tapes next to an old TV set. The tapes seem to be episodes of an early 2000s-era children’s cartoon they have never seen before. Intrigued, Riley pops the first tape into the VCR.

Relatively simplistic in appearance, it appears to have been made locally and features a little girl named Amanda and her loyal yet shy best friend, Wooly the Sheep. While the episode appears charming and straightforward on the surface, an unea

## Let Joker Sing: Why Joker 2 Should Not Be Shy About Being a Musical

Joker 2 is taking swings, whether you agree with Joker 2 review authors or not! The Joker 2 trailer hid something major: Joker: Folie A Deux is, effectively, a musical. But that’s not a bad thing at all! Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga as a new take on Harley Quinn are making moves that are right in line with the core of the Batman world in DC and Warner Bros. Arthur Fleck and his world first seen in the Joker 2 teaser are a natural extension, musically speaking, of a core Batman concept, and it is something WB should have led with, not hid. The Todd Phillips world was praised for its aesthetics and concepts, which naturally extend from the DC Comics stalwart world of Gotham. Ever since the Tim Burton revival, since the music of Batman 1989 appeared over the Warner Brothers logo, Batman turned from camp to The Batman, the headlining superhero we know today. From Adam West to Robert Pattinson, Batman is a vibe (yes, even Batman V Superman), and undeniably so. What goes into getting the b

## Critical Role Takes On Their Greatest Challenge Yet: Painting Each Other | The Legend of Vox Machina

The Legend of Vox Machina Season 3 premiere is right around the corner, so IGN sat down with the Critical Role team one last time before the new season hits Prime Video. This time, though, there’s a twist! We’ve challenged them with questions before, but we figured Fantastic Fest was worth cranking things up to a new level. In that spirit, we gave Liam O’Brien, Marisha Ray and Travis Willingham a mission: paint each other’s Vox Machina characters. Each of the cast and our host drew a character from the hat (Vax’ildan, Keyleth and Grog with a bonus Vex’ahlia, as there were four participants) and did their best to honor the work of their animation partners, Titmouse. There were some mixed results but, as always, plenty of shenanigans (and oodles of respect paid towards the animators who make magic happen every day — did you know painting is really hard?)

## EA FC 25 Review

EA Sports FC 25 reviewed by Robert Anderson on Xbox Series X, also available on Xbox One, PlayStation, and PC.

"After more than 20 years of EA Sports football titles, the cracks in this series are no longer subtle—they’re threatening its foundation. FC 25 takes steps forward, introducing some interesting new features such as the fast-paced and compelling Rush mode, but much of the package beyond that continues to feel overly familiar. Gameplay tweaks that are heading in the right direction don’t stop it from being stale and uninteresting this year, and struggles with a clunky, touchscreen-inspired UI bog everything down. Rush is the best thing to happen to the series in years, but even that can’t fully mask the prominent underlying problems."
