<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I run a blog related to true crime. I have found that local news networks have tons of interesting content of never before scene true crime that i would like to bring to light. i have all the websites that i look at. im looking for a website that will let me connect all these sites under one and let me use a custom date filter to look back between 2019-2020 for example. Is this possible to do with an RSS Feed? If so, would love some reccomendations</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/stigggy74"> /u/stigggy74 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1fudv4e/im_looking_for_an_rss_feed_that_includes_content/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1fudv4e/im_looking_for_an_rss_feed_that_includes_content/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have been creating a discord channel to include some of the Instagram account updates from 3rd parties. I used <a href="http://RSS.app">RSS.app</a> for a few days but the trail has ended. I am only a student who cannot afford to pay every month to generate feed as my discord server is free for use. Please help if you know there are some free ones, I&#39;d appreciate it!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/No_Produce105"> /u/No_Produce105 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1fu5q40/anywhere_that_i_could_create_instagram_rss_feed/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1fu5q40/anywhere_that_i_could_create_instagram_rss_feed/">[comments]</a></span>
