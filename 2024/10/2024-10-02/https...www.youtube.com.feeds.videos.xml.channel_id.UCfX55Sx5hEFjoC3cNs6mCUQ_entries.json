Bugs can further delay this process, often requiring reboots or even system redeployments.\n\nvirtme-ng aims to provide a standardized way for kernel developers to expedite the edit/compile/test cycle. It leverages QEMU/KVM, virtiofs, and overlayfs to boot a recompiled kernel (or any kernel image) inside a virtualized copy-on-write (CoW) live snapshot of the current system.\n\nThis approach allows developers to simply \"fork\" their system with a new kernel, creating a secure sandbox for testing that offers performance close to native ex", "id": 1256152, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgMLGM2UazY", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 499, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCfX55Sx5hEFjoC3cNs6mCUQ", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/ZgMLGM2UazY/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Mentorship Session: Speeding Up Kernel Development With virtme-ng", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-10-02T13:00:47+00:00", "description": "At #KubeCon + #CloudNativeCon, some of the most inspiring ideas are sparked through unexpected conversations.
