<p>Yesterday, Mozilla released Firefox 131 for Windows, macOS, Linux, and Android, which not only fixes a number of security vulnerabilities but also includes some interesting new features. They also released security updates for both ESR versions as well as the Tor Browser.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2024-46/">Mozilla’s security report for Firefox 131</a> lists more than 13 fixed security vulnerabilities, categorizing at least seven of them as “high risk.” As far as is known, none of them have been exploited in the wild.</p>



<p>You can use the <strong>Help > About Firefox</strong> menu to manually initiate an update check and download the update if you haven’t yet.</p>

<p>For a while now, some Microsoft 365 users have been running into problems when sending emails via Outlook.</p>



<p>More specifically, users who have more than 500 folders (!) in their Outlook inbox have been seeing a dialog box with error code 0x80040305. This obscure error code points to a “non-delivery report,” meaning the email didn’t reach its intended recipients.</p>



<p>The issue was <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/emails-sent-using-outlook-desktop-results-in-non-delivery-report-0x80040305-0x00000000-0x00000000-cafc5cd5-2f8f-41b6-a2e9-24baf21e9830">first confirmed by Microsoft back in early December</a>, but according to a September 30th update, it appears that Microsoft developers now believe they have found a solution — and that means it should be fixed in an upcoming update.</p>

<p>27-inch monitor? Sure. 1440p resolution? Sounds good. 180Hz refresh rate? Even better. IPS panel? Buddy, take my money! And not a lot of it because right now Amazon is selling <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0D68BYX1K/">this MSI gaming monitor for just $160</a>, a nice $30 discount off its regular $190 price.</p>



<p>The MSI MAG 275QF is a budget model, but I respect any gaming monitor that steps it up with an IPS LCD panel. That means it has much better color accuracy than the usual VA panels in this price range, good enough for my Photoshop work when I’m not gaming. That 2560×1440 resolution is pretty sharp, too. And 180Hz of refresh with a 0.5ms response time is fast enough for even competitive games.</p>



<p>Otherwise, the monitor is fairly basic, with DisplayPort and double HDMI inputs plus a headphone jack. The included stand has tilt

<p>Here’s a fantastic deal worth nabbing as we head into the final months of the year: a powerful RTX-powered gaming laptop for well under $1,000. Deals like this are rare, so don’t pass it up.</p>



<p>Right now, <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/msi-thin-15-15-6-144hz-fhd-gaming-laptop-intel-core-i5-13420h-16gb-memory-geforce-rtx-4050-512gb-ssd-black/6574954.p?skuId=6574954">this MSI Thin 15 gaming laptop is on sale for $700 at Best Buy</a>, which is $200 off its MSRP. At that price, it’s a total bargain.</p>



<p>This MSI Thin 15 config can easily handle your everyday tasks thanks to its Intel Core i5-13420H processor and 16GB of RAM on board. This combination is speedy enough to multitask apps and handle most games, but you can always upgrade later with up to 64GB of total RAM.</p>

<p>AMD’s Fluid Motion Frames 2 (FMF2) is the company’s allegedly AI-powered frame generation tech that’s meant to compete with Nvidia’s latest version of DLSS. It was first released to users <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2411947/amd-releases-ai-powered-fluid-motion-frames-2.html">back in July</a>, but that was in a beta version of the Adrenalin software package.</p>



<p>Today, it’s ready for prime time. AMD’s Adrenalin version 24.9.1 is the software’s first stable release to include FMF2.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://community.amd.com/t5/gaming/boost-gaming-performance-by-2-5x-with-amd-software-adrenalin/ba-p/711458">AMD’s promotional materials</a>, Fluid Motion Frames 2 is “AI-optimized for improved quality and smoothness,” using lower frame generation latency with lower overhead on integrated graphics.

<p>It’s been three years since Microsoft released the 2021 version of its inescapable Office apps suite, but the company hasn’t been resting on its laurels. The subscription-based, always-online Microsoft 365 has been getting constant tweaks and updates in that time.</p>



<p>But not everyone is keen on software-as-a-service. If you’d rather pay a flat fee for software, here’s some good news for you: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2024/09/30/office-2024-for-consumers-available-october-1/">Microsoft just released Office 2024 for consumers</a>.</p>



<p>The base version of Office 2024 is called Office Home — I see Microsoft is keeping up its tradition of terrible branding — and it includes Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and OneNote for a price tag of $150 on both PC and Mac.</p>

<p>Laptop cooling pads are dumb. At least, Razer seems to think so. This past weekend, the company announced what it’s calling an “intelligent” cooling solution, one meant to keep powerful laptops running at their peak.</p>



<p>Unveiled during the company’s RazerCon 2024 digital show, the <a href="https://www.razer.com/gaming-pc-accessories/razer-laptop-cooling-pad">Razer Laptop Cooling Pad</a> features dynamic fan control, a pressure chamber to trap cool air, and a system of swappable frames to support different laptop sizes ranging from 14- to 18-inches. If that sounds premium, it is: This universal laptop accessory runs $150, or roughly five-times the price of most rival products.</p>



<p>But for this cost, Razer promises a superior experience. The center chamber is touted as more efficient at trapping cool air, which is then circulated by a high-speed

Nvidia says it “intends to migrate all remaining GeForce Experience users to the new Nvidia App when it exits beta before the end of the year.” So if you’ve been resisting the switch to the new beta, it might be time to give up that particular ghost.</p>



<p>In addition to that news, <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/nvidia-app-beta-update-g-sync-controls-rtx-hdr-multi-monitor/">Nvidia’s blog post</a> outlines a host of new features for the app. G-Sync controls can now be accessed in the System tab, eliminating the confusing settings panel found deep in the bowels of Windows.

<p>Dash cams have come a long way from the rather primitive 480p products that were state-of-the-art when we first began our coverage eight years ago. These days, multi-channel front/interior/rear models abound, and capture quality is vastly improved — including 4K resolution.</p>



<p>Amenities such as phone connectivity, driver alerts, and voice commands are now common, and some dash cams will even upload videos to the cloud or call 911.</p>
