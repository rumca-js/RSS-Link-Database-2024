In Hollywood, landing a role on a hit TV show or a blockbuster movie can be a once in a lifetime moment.  Though sometimes, for one reason or another, things don't work out and actors get fired.  Sometimes for better, sometimes worse, when an actor gets fired it can change the dynamic of the entire production.  There are iconic roles in movies like Lord of the Rings and the MCU, as well as TV Shows like Big Bang Theory and That 70's Show that could have been very different if not for these changes.
