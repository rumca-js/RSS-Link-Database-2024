<p>Apple has been accused of violating union rights, according to a complaint filed by the US National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) .</p>

<p>The Apple product machine continues to whirr, with a host of new products, including Macs, iPads, and iPhone SE, expected to appear this fall. </p>



<p>Some of these new products will represent powerful improvements compared to older hardware, as the intention is to ensure Apple Intelligence runs well on all the company’s devices. That means a big jump in processor power and might also mean a bump in memory — both of which should raise the performance bar, even for those entry-level products you intend to deploy across your business.</p>



<p>In brief, the list of upcoming product upgrades is expected to include:</p>

<p>Microsoft on Tuesday <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2024/10/01/new-experiences-coming-to-copilot-pcs-and-windows-11/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unveiled the latest AI features for Copilot+ PCs</a>, with improved Windows search and a tool that can detect and act on the contents of a user’s screen. </p>

<p>We live in a multi-device world. At a minimum, you almost certainly have both a computer and a phone — and potentially many more devices than that!</p>



<p>And when it comes to transferring files between your Windows PC and whatever phone you’re using, you’re absolutely spoiled for choice. Microsoft, Google, and Apple have all developed their own ways to send files back and forth between a phone and computer, and you might not even <em>need </em>any of those systems to get the job done.</p>



<p>The real question is just which method makes the most sense for you. I’ll walk you through the best options so you can figure that out and be as productive as possible on both your phone — be it an An

<p>Did you ever watch the early 2000s TV series <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrubs_(TV_series)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Scrubs</em></a>?</p>



<p>The show revolved around a young doctor named JD who always meant well but often got lost in his own head and ended up making ill-advised decisions. In one episode, he started seeing a fantastical opera singer who’d show up over his shoulder and sing an emphatic “MISTAAAAAKE!!!” every time he did something dumb.</p>

<p>Microsoft on Tuesday confirmed it is no longer producing the HoloLens 2, the company’s second-generation augmented reality headset <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/1719369/microsoft-aims-hololens-2-at-the-enterprise.html">first launched</a> five years ago at Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Barcelona.</p>



<p>At the time of launch, analysts predicted the new device could build momentum for augmented reality (AR) technology, which had so far failed to get serious traction. This is something that, for the most part, has not materialized.</p>



<p>A Microsoft spokesperson said the company has also “signaled a last time to buy for customers and partners. Support for HoloLens 2, includ
