Biodiversity is essential for the processes that support all life on Earth. It provides critical resources such as food and energy, and supports ecosystem health. However, climate change, deforestation, and pollution are destroying habitats, altering ecosystems, and eliminating—or introducing—species that are fundamental for the planet's biosphere.

Amazon has announced that it will end remote work for its office staff starting in January 2025. A decision that seems to go against the current, as the increasing pace of digitalization since the recent pandemic has marked a turning point for teleworking. Prior to the 2020 health crisis, this form of working was practically unimaginable for many companies but, since then, its presence has continued to grow in importance.

Endosymbiosis is a fascinating biological phenomenon in which an organism lives inside another. Such an unusual relationship is often beneficial for both parties. Even in our bodies, we find remnants of such cohabitation: mitochondria evolved from an ancient endosymbiosis. Long ago, bacteria entered other cells and stayed. This coexistence laid the foundation for mitochondria and thus the cells of plants, animals, and fungi.

A new paper, "Differences in misinformation sharing can lead to politically asymmetric sanctions," published today in Nature suggests that the higher quantity of social media policy enforcement (such as account suspensions) for conservative users could be explained by the higher quantity of misinformation shared by those conservative users—and so does not constitute evidence of inherent biases in the policies from social media companies or in the definition of what constitutes misinformation.

Listeria monocytogenes, a bacterium that causes listeriosis, a serious disease, can go into dormancy when confronted with environmental stress, for example in the presence of detergents or in water devoid of nutrients. It then becomes undetectable by the tests commonly used in the food industry and hospitals, thus representing a major health risk.

In legends and fables, it brings luck, children and prosperity. Today, its appearance is seen as a sign of a healthy environment. Hardly any other bird in Europe has such positive connotations as the white stork Ciconia ciconia. But how old is this close relationship between humans and storks? Where and how was this relationship formed?

Chirality is an essential property in biology; the molecular building blocks of some of the most important biological structures, including DNA and proteins, are chiral. When a molecule is said to be chiral, it means that it is distinguishable from its mirror image, much like how one's left hand cannot be superposed onto the right hand. Interestingly, chirality can also affect how a molecule or a molecular aggregate emits or responds to light, especially circularly polarized light.

It's important to eat your veggies, but some essential vitamins and nutrients can only be found in animals, including certain amino acids and peptides. Now, in a proof-of-concept study published in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, researchers have developed a method to produce creatine, carnosine and taurine—all animal-based nutrients and common workout supplements—right inside a plant. The system allows for different synthetic modules to be easily stacked together to boost production.

Long-term smoke exposure from massive wildfires lowers the energy reserves of orchard trees and can cut their nut production by half, researchers at the University of California, Davis, found. The smoke can affect trees for months after a megafire, depressing their bloom and the next season's harvest. This finding reveals a new danger from wildfires that could affect plant health in both agricultural and natural environments.

Phones can be useful tools in classrooms to remind students of deadlines or encourage more exchange between students and teachers. At the same time, they can be distracting. Students report using their phones for non-academic purposes as often as 10 times a day. Thus, in many classrooms, phones are not allowed.
