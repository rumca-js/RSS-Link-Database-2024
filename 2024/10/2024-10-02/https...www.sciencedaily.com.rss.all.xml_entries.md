Despite growing evidence of the importance of student well-being and an abundance of best practices, most institutions have yet to prioritize it as much as they do enrollment, graduation and grades. A new study provides guidance on how institutions can support and enhance student well-being, and breaks down the various benefits for learners during and beyond their university career. It identifies general student experiences that have resulted in improved well-being later in life, and shares guiding principles for institutions looking to create their own.

Amethyst is a violet variety of quartz which has been used as a gemstone for many centuries and is a key economic resource in northern Uruguay. Geodes are hollow rock formations often with quartz crystals, such as amethyst, inside. Amethyst geodes in Uruguay have been found in cooled lava flows, which date from the original breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana around 134 million years ago. However, their formation has remained a mystery.

Scientists have made an enormous step toward understanding the human brain by building a neuron-by-neuron and synapse-by-synapse roadmap -- scientifically speaking, a 'connectome' -- through the brain of an adult fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster). Previous researchers have mapped the brain of a C. elegans worm, with its 302 neurons, and the brain of a larval fruit fly, which had 3,000 neurons, but the adult fruit fly is several orders of magnitude more complex, with almost 140,000 neurons and 50 million synapses connecting them. The full brain map is the result of a collaboration between cutting-edge artificial intelligence, gamers, professional tracers, and neuroscientists. This connectome is important not only because the adult Drosophila has the most complex brain ever mapped, but also because fruit flies share many behaviors with humans as well as 75% of the genes that cause genetic diseases.

Dolphins are extremely playful, but little is known about how they -- and other marine mammals -- communicate during playtime. New research shows that bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncates) use the 'open mouth' facial expression -- analogous to a smile -- to communicate during social play. The dolphins almost always use the facial expression when they are in their playmate's field of view, and when playmates perceived a 'smile,' they responded in kind 33% of the time.

Ever wish you could stop that fruit fly on your kitchen counter in its tracks? Scientists have created flies that halt under red light.

They demonstrate how the brain engages different neural mechanisms depending on environmental context.

## Study links hurricanes to higher death rates long after storms pass

U.S. tropical cyclones, including hurricanes, indirectly cause thousands of deaths for nearly 15 years after a storm. Researchers estimate an average U.S. tropical cyclone indirectly causes 7,000 to 11,000 excess deaths. All told, they estimate tropical storms since 1930 have contributed to between 3.6 million and 5.2 million deaths in the U.S. -- more than all deaths nationwide from motor vehicle accidents, infectious diseases, or battle deaths in wars during the same period.

However, if glucose levels plunge too low -- from taking too much insulin or not eating enough sugar -- people can experience hypoglycemia, which can lead to dizziness, cognitive impairment, seizures or comas. To prevent and treat this condition, researchers report encapsulating the hormone glucagon. In mouse trials, the nanocapsules activated when blood sugar levels dropped dangerously low and quickly restored glucose levels.
