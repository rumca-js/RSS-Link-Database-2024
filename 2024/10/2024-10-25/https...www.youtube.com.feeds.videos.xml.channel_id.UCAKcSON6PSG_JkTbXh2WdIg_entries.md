Friday, May 17, 2024, at the Amsterdam Bar & Hall in St. Paul, Pokey LaFarge and his band ignited the crowd during a generous and lively Microshow that comprised 15 songs and an encore. LaFarge, who had just released his latest album, Rhumba Country, on May 10, integrated the Microshow into a tour schedule that saw him in Duluth the night before and in Viroqua, Wisconsin, the following night. The set list naturally included several songs from the new release, including this one, "It's Not Over." 

Concert attendees consisted of lucky winners who entered for a chance to win passes to the show. This Microshow event was supported by Fat Tire Classic Ale. 

"Rhumba Country" is available on @NewWestRecords .
