<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi, I have been going through the process of setting up a self hosted media sever using docker. I am trying to implement a VPN for some traffic, but have been struggling to get anything working whenever I implement a docker container that utilizes a VPN. The VPN I&#39;ve been using is NordVPN, but I am seeing that this is potentially not the best as they don&#39;t allow for VPN tunneling? </p> <p>I would just like to learn what others have gotten working and maybe some areas to avoid. I&#39;ve been able to have a VPN running on the machine itself, outside of docker altogether, but am worried that I won&#39;t be able to expose my Plex server to the broader WAN reliably with my public IP varying with the VPN. Please, school me- I am getting desperate 😩</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Party_Commercial6990"> /u/Party_Commercial6990 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comment

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone! I’m Antonio, CEO at Litlyx. </p> <p>Today, I want to discuss something close to my heart as an open-source developer and project founder. Many of us who put time, effort, and expertise into open-source projects do it because we believe in transparency, community growth, and the idea that innovation should be accessible to everyone. However, open-source projects often attract companies that build their business on top of our work but rarely give back to the community that supports them. I call them “jackals”, companies that exploit without respect for the ecosystem they&#39;re drawing from.</p> <p>The recent PearAI scandal is an eye opener. PearAI’s story isn&#39;t unique. There are companies everywhere that leverage open-source codebases to build their products without adequately recognizing, supporting, or giving back to the community that made their work possible. Open-source developers see their work commercialized, often without eve
