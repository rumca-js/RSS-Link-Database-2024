<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Will a 5V/1A DC battery pack properly power the 3b+? on the site it says you need 5V/2.5A DC but I don&#39;t know enough about power to know if it will damage anything if I try it.</p> <p>I know the answer is probably going to be no but before I go buy a new battery pack I wanted to ask.</p> <p>Specifically I&#39;m using a iHome 2200mha portable phone charging battery pack</p> <p>Also before this gets removed Ive looked it up and have seen that its okay to charge a battery with lets amps than needed but I dont know if its okay to power something like that.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/offhandaxe"> /u/offhandaxe </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1gc3grs/help_with_3b_power_supply/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1gc3grs/help_with_3b_power_supply/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Just been tinkering with different OSes for the Raspberry Pi 400 - and here is my personal opinions I would like to share</p> <p><em>Raspberry Pi OS 64-bit (stock)</em> - Pros: official OS (so works well OOB), runs a modified version of Debian 12 - Cons: PIXEL desktop is a bit meh, Pi Apps repository doesn&#39;t have many apps ðŸ˜‚</p> <p><em>Raspberry Pi OS 64-bit Lite (CLI only)</em> - Pros: as above - Cons: no GUI, root user has no password by default... seriously?? ðŸ¤”</p> <p>-&gt; you can install your own favoruite GUI (using Tasksel), which then runs pretty nice (I&#39;d say better than stock Pi OS)</p> <p><em>Debian 12 (arm64) on Raspberry Pi</em> - Pros: pure Debian (enough said) - Cons: minimal image (need to self-install standard deb utilities), no GUI (can be self-installed), GPU driver buggy (due to Mesa version on Debian stable)</p> <p>-&gt; I&#39;ve tried in place switch the Debian testing, Mesa is fixed but sound driver gets borked ðŸ˜ž</p> <p
