Congratulations are in order for Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft! <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a>'s animated adaptation of the iconic video game series has successfully managed to appease the streaming service gods and will be returning for a second season (not that I'm extremely bitter about Kaos' cancellation or anything) at some unspecified future point.

We've seen some unique approaches to arachnophobia modes in video games as they've started to become more common in recent years, but nothing quite like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a>'s new approach. Activision's solution somehow makes everything even more horrifying, by robbing its zombie spiders of legs and turning them into something arguably worse.

In one sense that's just the nature of football, a sport which seems to defy all logic in its ability to create sparkling new drama from the same, enormously well-documented scenarios. But in this case I'm really talking quite specifically about a single club, in Manchester United. A club of which - sorry - I am a lifelong fan.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-sports-fc-25-review">Read more</a></p>
