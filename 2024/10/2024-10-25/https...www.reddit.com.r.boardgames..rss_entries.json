Recently bought the game (in czech language) and was looking for the ENG rules. Which I found on their official website. But it&#39;s missing all the missions for whatever reason. So I&#39;m stuck now, not being able to read the missions in my czech rulebook and online, you can&#39;t find a download of the Mission. Somebody can help me out?
