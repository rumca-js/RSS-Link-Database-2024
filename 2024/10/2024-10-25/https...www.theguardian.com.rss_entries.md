In case you haven’t heard, it’s the Dodgers and the Yankees bidding for the oversized heavy and expensive jewellery, something they’ve done 11 times prior: seven times via Bronx/Brooklyn NYC subway and four times via continental jet. It’s the first time since they’ve met in the Fall Classic since the Dodgers beat the Yanks in 1981.</p><p>Both clubs are under enormous pressure to win a World Series title. The Dodgers won in the Covid-19 season of 2020 which, let’s be honest, few take seriously. The Yankees are in their first World Series since 2009, the longest such gap in appearances since the franchise’s founding in 1903. Babe Ruth helped the N

<p>Maya Le Tissier and Grace Clinton must be wondering what else they have to do to impress the England manager</p><p>A common theme across Sarina Wiegman’s tenure has been a notion that she would only pick players who were performing for their clubs.

<p>The muted response to Stacey Williams’ story is a bleak sign of how America has come to respond to these accusations</p><p>Does sexual assault matter politically? Eight years ago, in October of 2016, many people thought that it did. When the Access Hollywood tape was released on 7 October of that year, and audio blared from every cable news channel in which Donald Trump, attempting to impress the celebrity interviewer Billy Bush, bragged that his stardom meant he could grab women “by the pussy”, the incident was, for a moment at least, widely believed to have ended his presidential bid. The clip sparked outrage, condemnation and calls for Trump to drop out of the race – including from sitting Republican governors, senators and representative. The Republican National Committee <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/rnc-halts-all-victory-project-work-for-trump-229363">suspended support</a> for Trump’s campaign in response to the tape.

<p>Unaware he’s married to a spy, Beckinsale’s husband is kidnapped – cue the baddies demanding a secret file, fancy action sequences, lots of gunshots and a nice trenchcoat</p><p>French director Pierre Morel oversaw the making of the first Taken film, the action thriller wherein former CIA-agent Liam Neeson pursues bad guys who kidnap his teenage daughter, and later abduct both the hero and his wife in subsequent sequels. So clearly someone thought there was no one better than Morel to direct what is effectively a remake of Taken, this time a story in which a female spy with a very particular set of skills must rescue her kidnapped husband, who knows nothing of her espionage career. The result is blandly generic with the gender flip not bringing much to the table apart from some cheerable lines where the heroine upbraids her opponents for using the slur “bitch” in the workplace.</p><p>That said, Morel once again does well with the complex action sequences, especially the car chases

<p>Paintings include one depicting a scantily clad Phaedra, mythological queen of Athens, and her stepson Hippolytus</p><p>A tiny house featuring erotic frescoes is the latest discovery in the ruins of the ancient Roman city of Pompeii. Experts say the exquisitely decorated abode, called the House of Phaedra after the mythological queen of Athens, sheds light on the changing architectural styles in the first century AD but is also further proof that the residents of Pompeii had an appetite for sensual art.</p><p>The vividly coloured wall paintings include one depicting a sexual encounter between a satyr and a nymph on a bed and one of a scantily clad Phaedra and her stepson Hippolytus whom, according to Greek legend, she accused of rape after he spurned her advances. Another fresco features gods presumed to be Venus and Adonis.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/25/tiny-house-erotic-frescoes-phaedra-pompeii">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Hampstead theatre, London</strong><br>Two sides of the same event are explored in Richard Bean’s drama – one haunting, one comedic – but they don’t really fit together</p><p>There is a tension from the off between the tragic and comic in Richard Bean’s drama about the trawler fishing industry. A vessel has sunk off the coast of Iceland. Fifteen men are dead. Their families need to be informed and it is up to the company boss to manage the crisis. Amid the gloom, there are nervy balls of humour as characters swirl through his Hull office.</p><p>Set in the mid-1970s, this is a return to the muscular world of the fishing industry for Bean who wrote his award-winning play, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2003/apr/15/theatre.artsfeatures1">Under the Whaleback</a>, two decades ago.

<p>As the nights draw in, these winter warmers really come into their own</p><p>When the weather gets colder and wetter, and it starts getting dark earlier and earlier, I find myself involuntarily singing these words from Autumn Almanac by the Kinks: “Tea and toasted buttered currant buns / Can’t compensate for lack of sun / Because the summer’s all gone.”</p><p>As Ray Davies noted there, much of what we eat and drink is governed by the changing seasons. In the days before tanning salons and winter breaks in Lanzarote, the only way Britons could get a bit of sunshine in their lives when autumn arrived was by consuming something comforting. Wines such as port and sherry brought the warmth of the south to rainy northern Europe, combined with a good dose of alcohol to keep out the cold. Can it be a coincidence that both have declined in popularity as homes have become better heated? But they really do come into their own at this time of year.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/foo

<p><strong>Royal Shakespeare theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon</strong><br>John Douglas Thomas and Juliet Rylance reprise their New York roles as Othello and Desdemona, while Will Keen is all gripe and snipe as shaven-headed Iago</p><p>With its fibs, delusions and mislaid props, Shakespeare’s Othello is structured almost like farce – one that goes horribly wrong.

Intelligent, if too even-toned to thrill, it unfolds with rare clarity.</p><p>John Douglas Thompson’s Othello appears the epitome of calm – an unruffled, spellbinding speaker. Beaming when Desdemona arrives, it’s hard to believe their love could falter. Thompson and Juliet Rylance played these same roles in New York in 2009; the now mature casting (also including Edward Hogg’s ill-at-ease Cassio) would suggest cool heads who could easily resolve misunderstandings.

<p><strong>The Pit, Barbican, London</strong> <br>Finn Beames and Company’s show is overwrought but features a fine performance from Oscar-nominated actor Ruth Negga, playing a queer boy struggling to fit in</p><p>A string quartet in school uniforms scrape their bows along the edges of swords while an adolescent boy in the foetal position recounts his fear of the school bullies waiting to make fun of his breaking voice.</p><p>Quiet Songs, the debut show from writer, director and composer Finn Beames, is a slight and strange undertaking, telling the semi-autobiographical story of a queer coming-of-age. Oscar-nominated actor Ruth Negga is the Boy, artfully inhabiting the space between a child’s gangly looseness and a teen’s self-consciousness in her performance, languorously draping herself across the bare stage as she unearths a tale of bodies betraying identity and the desperate quest to remain within the norm.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2024/oct/25/quiet-songs-re

<p>The fierce Lee Miller is the role Kate Winslet was born to play, plus Steven Spielberg and more line up to wax lyrical about the most legendary composer in the history of cinema. What a bringer of joy</p><p>Lee Miller’s life is the sadly familiar case of a female artist whose work has been overlooked because of her collaboration with a famous man, in this instance as a model for Man Ray. It’s her subsequent career as a war photographer that director Ellen Kuras and star Kate Winslet focus on in their <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/sep/15/lee-review-kate-winslet-remarkable-portrait-of-war-photographer-lee-miller-ellen-kuras">fierce film</a>.

You get a similar feeling listening to this album by surrealist US-Belgian duo Fievel Is Glauque, a jazz-pop LP that yanks you into its own world, full of songs scurrying about Seuss-ishly.</p><p>Supplanted by six other instrumentalists, the pair would record one take for each song, then another, then a final one with extra improvisatory details, generating as many as 100 musical stems to put into a final arrangement. Coupled with poetic lyrics that often rush by in a torrent and time signatures that change on a dime, it could have been a mess – and yet these teetering song-towers never topple.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardia

The 19-metre boat’s hold emitted an insufferable odour,” he quoted the article as saying.</p><p>“This news story could have been published last week, and the migrants could have been Nigerian, Senegalese or Moroccan,” said Sánchez. “In reality, it appeared in a Venezuelan daily on 25 May 1949, and its protagonists were Spaniards, 106 of the 120,000 who crossed [the Atlantic] between 1945 and 1978 to escape misery and Franco’s dictatorship.”</p> <a href="https://www.th

<p><strong>Circle in the Square, New York</strong></p><p>West Side Story’s Rachel Zegler and Heartstopper’s Kit Connor lift an aggressively poppy new youth take on the tragic romance </p><p>Like the pangs of romance or the pull of melodrama, adolescent angst proves timeless. Sam Gold, the director of a newly revived Romeo + Juliet on Broadway, knows this – the production, an admirably diverse, comfortably queer and aggressively zillennial version featuring original music from pop maestro Jack Antonoff, leans hard into the text’s hot-blooded, definitively teenage impulsivity. But he doesn’t seem to trust it. Romeo + Juliet, so styled after the 1996 Baz Luhrmann film with which it shares an ultra-contemporary, lusty ethos, feels from the jump overeager to assure today’s youths that the stir-crazy teens of Verona were just like them – stressed, pressed and bursting at the seams with feeling, as told by a Netflix heartthrob (Heartstopper’s Kit Connor) and a Spielberg leading lady (West S
