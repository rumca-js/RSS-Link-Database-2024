With over fifty short story anthologies and a slew of awards to her credit, Paula Guran is an undisputed queen of her craft. Although it is titled, The Year\u2019s Best Dark Fantasy and Horror (Volume 5), the current volume is actually Guran\u2019s fifteenth entry in the series, since the numbering was reset after switching publishers to Pyr Books five years ago. Every short story by A.C. Wise is a treat. As the first entry in The Year\u2019s Best Dark Fantasy and Horror (Volume 5), Wise\u2019s psychological horror \u201cThe Dark House\u201d is no exception. \u201cThe Dark House\u201d concerns a photographer\u2019s obsession with the eponymous house, which he uses exclusively as a darkroom for developing photographs. But the images that develop reveal more than expected. Another standout story is \u201cAll the Things I Know About Ghosts, By Ofelia, Age 10\u201d by Isabel Ca\u00f1as.
