How to waterproof Schluter shower niche inside corners…I apply KERDI-FIX then thin-set, this keeps the inside corner stuck while I compress it into the mortar. I like this method for custom niches because it keeps the corners and banding in place while I install them. Ultimately it helps tremendously with the tile work. Many thanks to Schluter for providing materials for my client’s shower build 🙌🏽🔥#schluter #bathroomremodel #homerenovation #brandpartner
