The scrape comprises of several steps, firstly I need to scrape all of the auction listings, this is because the auctions lists always comprise of a URL and importantly a date.</p> <p>This information is then stored in Postgres, which the script will then use to know when to activate the script to start scraping the auction website. This also needs a trigger action to know when to scrape the last bid because they are all on staggered timers and will increase to 5 minutes each time someone bids with the timer lower than 5.</p> <p>My question is, has anyone done anything like this before?
