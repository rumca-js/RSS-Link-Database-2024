It's been a long wait, and developer GSC Game World has certainly been through the wringer behind the scenes, but S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl is finally almost upon us. Its blend of immersive sim, survival horror, and first-person shooter open world action has looked increasingly promising in all that we've seen of it thus far, with the long-awaited sequel looking like the sort of return to the limelight that S.T.A.L.K.E.R. fans have been hoping to see for the franchise for so long.

S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 is, of course, going to be a familiar kind of gameplay experience to returning series fans, but at the same time, GSC Game World is also evolving, tweaking, and improving upon the series' formula in more than a few ways. With the game set to launch not long from now, here, we're going to look at a few such ways that the series' highly anticipated return is going to be different from the original S.T.A.L.K.E.R. trilogy.

It's always interesting to look back at the previous generation of gaming, especially with the PS4 and Xbox One. The former was far more successful in delivering exclusives that players cared about, but the latter somewhat overcame the initially poor pre-launch perception.

However, in this day and age where cross-gen titles are still a thing, the Xbox One represents a viable option for those who can't afford an Xbox Series X/S or PS5. Major role-playing games, including Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth and Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree, were released this year alone. On the action front, you have Halo Infinite, Dying Light, Destiny 2 and many others.

Based on previous years, what can Xbox One players feasibly dive into in 2024? Has the year increased the number of worthwhile options? Check out our 30 picks for the best Xbox One titles and find out for yourself.
