For the first time, astronomers have detected brown dwarfs outside the Milky Way in the star cluster NGC 602, situated approximately 200,000 light-years away in the Small Magellanic Cloud. Utilising the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the team sought young brown dwarf candidates in an environment that resembles the early universe, with limited heavier elements. The research underscores the importance of this new technology in exploring cosmic phenomena. This discovery not only expands our understanding of brown dwarfs—substellar objects that share characteristics with giant gas planets—but also holds implications for understanding stellar formation in various conditions across the universe.
