In today's Daily Fix:
Blizzard is offering a new mount in World of Warcraft, this one going for a whopping $90. But unline a lot of optional items in games, the price isn't scaring away fans who are buying the 'brutosaurs' en masse. In other news, the publishing director for Baldur's Gate 3 had some words for Ubisoft. Ubi recently closed the team behind the acclaimed Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, despite being a fan-favorite and scoring well with critics. Unfortunately that wasn't enough to translate to sales, but Larian's Michael Douse believes the problem lies with Ubisoft's "subs over sales" business model.

Uzumaki, reviewed by Mat Jones. Narrated by Stella Chung.

We presumed Uzumaki’s lengthy production was to ensure that the entire series would be of the same high caliber as its first episode. It’s now clear that’s not the case. Strange decisions and circumstances have befallen the creative team over at Adult Swim, who have given us a mostly poor attempt at translating the rest of Uzumaki to TV, with minimal animation, bad compositing, and a rushed-through story. It might be worth checking out the premiere and writing the rest off.

## Like a Dragon: Yakuza Review

Like a Dragon: Yakuza, reviewed by Mat Jones. Narrated by Ronny Barrier.

Without the Like A Dragon name attached, this series would get very little attention. There's so little that's very Yakuza in tone, and it’s so limited in inspiration from the games that there’s hardly much you’ll recognize from them. There’s great character work from some of the cast – particularly Kento Kaku as Nishikiyama – but sadly nothing very interesting for them to do.

Welcome back to Next-Gen Console Watch. This week, Daemon is joined by Podcast Beyond's Max Scoville and Jada Griffin to talk about remasters. They're all the rage these days with games coming out a generation ago already getting the remaster treatment (looking at you, Horizon Zero Dawn). But there are plenty of older games that could use a fresh coat of paint, like Metal Gear Solid 4, Dino Crisis, and Star Wars: Rogue Squadron 2. We discuss which we want to see, and go over last week's poll results.

## Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed Review

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed reviewed by Luke Reilly on PC. Also available on Xbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo Switch.

"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed certainly looks the part, coming admirably close to emulating the scrawled, asymmetrical look of the acclaimed 2023 animated film it functions as a sequel to. It also sounds the part thanks to some genuinely impressive voice acting (although shelling out for some of the ’90s hip hop that gave the movie its own aural edge clearly wasn’t within the budget). However, despite a visible effort to make Mutants Unleashed a lengthy and credible follow-up story to the film, its simple button bashing action quickly becomes boring thanks to its slim selection of enemies and its constantly reused levels. Trying to do too much with too little means it all just becomes rather… vanilla, and that’s a shell of a loaded word to use around the green machine, who rock the town without being seen."

In today's Daily Fix:
Circana has revealed that not only has EA Sports College Football 25 beaten Madden 25 as the best-selling game of the year (so far), it's now the best-selling football game of all time...based on dollar amount. The award for best-selling football game by units sold goes to Madden 07. In other news, Yooka-Laylee remaster, Yooka-Replaylee, has been announced for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and...Nintendo consoles. In the reveal trailer, a pair of eyes suspiciously eyes the Nintendo logo, and the Switch logo is also absent. Is this a hint that the remaster will be coming to the Switch 2? C'mon, Nintendo, announce something—we're starving for news over here.
