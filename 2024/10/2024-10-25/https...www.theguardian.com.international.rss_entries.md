<p>At some point Steve Cooper must have wondered what kind of reception he would receive from the travelling Nottingham Forest supporters but, unfortunately for the Leicester manager, it took a chastening defeat to their East Midlands rivals to find out. After Chris Wood feasted on some laughable Leicester defending to add his second and Forest’s third, the away fans returned to an old hit. “Stevie Cooper, Stevie Cooper, he hates the Leicester, he hates the Derby, Forest are massive,” filled the air as Leicester’s stunned fans sat in silence. The reality is Forest should have made it 4-1 but the homegrown midfielder Ryan Yates, who opened the scoring, missed a sitter from four yards.</p><p>Only Erling Haaland has scored more league goals than Wood’s tally of seven this season and the Forest striker’s first, with his back to goal, was a beauty.

<p>LeBron James and his son are following in rare sporting footsteps but at least they aren’t trying to beat each other</p><p>LeBron James’s shadow is a big one for anyone to step into. Earlier this year the NBA’s all-time leading scorer topped 40,000 points and played in a record 20th All-Star game. On Tuesday, the 39-year-old recorded another first: he played in the NBA <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/22/lebron-bronny-james-los-angeles-lakers-father-son-nba">alongside his son</a>. Which means Bronny James, too, has achieved something unique in the history of basketball. Not bad for a 20-year-old rookie who’s played three minutes in the big leagues, against the Minnesota Timberwolves.</p><p>The occasion was hyped to the max – Nike made a bespoke advert in which LeBron supposedly hazed his new teammate – and yes, it was a sentimental moment, not least because Bronny suffered a cardiac arrest in training last year. But it was also a feat of engineering, years in th

Here are some of the more unexpected revelations</p><p>When Penguin bought the rights to Al Pacino’s memoir in 2022 for $5m, it raised questions about the true value of Hollywood celebrity autobiography at a time when most stars happily spill sanctioned life highlights for free on social media.</p><p>Yet it seems there remains a considerable premium on the value of stories from those actors who have kept themselves relatively private. Pacino’s book, Sonny Boy, published last week, is boasting healthy hardback sales – it entered the Bookseller’s top bestsellers list at No 9 – and a strikingly good trade in newspaper syndication.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/oct/25/al-pacino-memoir-sonny-boy-14-things-we-learned">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Lack of time, difficulties with scientific rigour, an uninterested public … television meteorologists open up about why they’re so quiet about the reasons for extreme conditions</p><p>Why do TV and radio forecasts rarely contextualise extreme weather events in terms of the climate crisis? After all, the latest data suggests Britain is getting hotter, wetter and stormier. The number of “very hot days” of 30C or more, according to the Met Office’s latest <a href="https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/climate/maps-and-data/about/state-of-climate">climate report</a>, has trebled over the last few decades.

<p>You’ll keep coming back for this orangey Greek favourite </p><p>This cake is a true revelation; it uses dried filo sheets to create a moreish texture. I first tasted it on holiday in Cyprus, and sought tips and tricks from the pastry chef at the hotel I was staying in. Back home, I consulted <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/georgina-hayden">Georgina Hayden</a>, who told me that it’s one of her favourite cakes of all time.

<p>The wildly successful mogul’s first drama series for the streamer is a disaster with one-dimensional characters and haphazard plotting</p><p>Beauty in Black is a new Netflix series whose main reason for being is to drive subscriptions. All eight of its hour-long episodes were written, produced and directed by Tyler Perry – a billionaire who measures the success of his streaming films and TV shows by that score.</p><p>On paper Beauty in Black is the story of two women “leading very different lives”. Kimmie (Taylor Polidore Williams) is the gold-hearted sex worker with dreams of making a legitimate turn into cosmetology. Mallory (Crystle Stewart) is the face of a beauty empire that also happens to oversee the dark underworld to which Kimmie is bound. On screen, it is proudly obscene and deliberately pornographic – the first Perry series to earn a TV-MA rating. Ten minutes into the pilot we’re dropped inside a strip club.

<p>So long as you split them, the vegetable’s pink stalks will guarantee you fresh crumbles for years to come</p><p>Now that my veg patch is&nbsp;four seasons old, I’ve found myself reflecting on the decisions I made when I set it up. Some of those choices need to&nbsp;be addressed, or even undone. The wire fence that keeps wildlife from grazing on my crops is buckling and falling down. Two of the perennial beds spend most of the year in the shade of a willow tree and, as a result, some of the plants there have failed to thrive. And, while some crops are doing well, if I want them to continue flourishing it’s time for me to act.</p><p>One such plant is my very handsome rhubarb that has been going from strength to strength, year on year. It’s doing so well that its increasing numbers of stems, ever-widening crown (the section of the root that joins the stems together) and enormous, crinkled leaves are pushing over my aforementioned fence. Now it’s definitively autumn and rhubarb is in

<p>Giant multinationals are swallowing up independent breweries yet keeping the subversive, sock-it-to-the-man branding. Do they think drinkers are daft?</p><p>When I first began working in the beer industry, the words “craft beer” were used as a shorthand to describe any beer that wasn’t cask or a more well-understood style or brand, such as lager or Guinness. (A caveat here: in Lancashire, where I live, “normal” beer has always been cask. When I worked in a local pub, calling something craft beer was a useful, if not mostly meaningless, way to explain to a customer that what they were getting wasn’t a pint of bitter.)</p><p>Over time, people came to understand that craft beer usually referred to one of those new American-style beers, full of hops and probably hazy. People were suspicious at first. Then they grew to love it, coming in each week to try new beers by breweries with unusual names, excited to taste the latest inventions in hops and malt.</p><p>Katie Mather is a food and

<p>It might be a golden age for children’s television, but no one told the Italian football team. Their horrific show about a cartoon zebra and pals feels like it was designed to punish youngsters</p><p>I have long argued that we are living through a golden age of children’s television. If you search for it, you’ll quickly be inundated with shows that run rings around whatever we were served as kids. Hey Duggee is exceptional. Bluey is amazing. The new Super Happy Magic Forest series on CBBC is shaping up to be an all-timer.

It grew quickly,” says Okir, 78. “I felt fear. It was hard to dress. I had a lot of back and waist pain and many issues with my wife. Our relationship wasn’t going well. I was scared to go out in public.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/oct/25/genital-swelling-disease-mosquito-borne-infection-lymphatic-filariasis-hydrocele">Continue reading...</a>

Boris Johnson, notoriously, did not. Under Keir Starmer, there is a moral compass in Downing Street once more. But something else has gone missing. Too often, Labour now seems to lack not a moral compass, but a fully functioning political one. It has never needed one more than it does today.</p><p>Recent history suggests that any government’s political compass is a powerful embodiment of its survival instinct. The compass addresses the dangers, as well as the attractions, of a course of action. It recognises that the way an action will be portrayed is a reality as powerful as the intention behind it. It prioritises grip, speed and proactive flair, as well as discipline about priorities.</p><p>Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.the
