For all its pervasiveness and the efforts to study it, cancer is still somewhat of a mystery. Why do some animals get it at a higher rate than others? This is the question at the heart of Peto's paradox, the observation that large animals, by virtue of their number of cells, are statistically more likely than smaller animals to develop and accumulate genetic mutations that lead to cancer, yet they don't. In fact, some large animals, including whales and elephants, get much less cancer than expected for an animal of its body size and number of cells.

## Climate scientist identifying water requirements for climate mitigation through ecosystem restoration

Worldwide, deforestation and farming practices are responsible for the degradation of vital ecosystems. While there is a significant amount of interest in climate mitigation by restoring those degraded lands with forests and other ecosystems, it is unclear how feasible that would be and the resulting benefits. Previous studies have not considered the effects of ecosystem restoration on available water resources and in environments with water constraints. Water scarcity is already a key issue worldwide that is likely to only get worse in the future.

One of the characteristics of depression is a tendency to perceive sensory stimuli and everyday situations in an excessively negative way. But the mechanisms underpinning this 'negativity bias,' which can fuel the development of depressive symptoms, had previously remained largely unknown. To shed light on the question, scientists decided to explore the amygdala and observe how it functions during depressive episodes. Their findings suggest that a depressive state alters certain specific neural circuits, leading to a reduction in the activity of neurons involved in pleasant perceptions of positive stimuli and an overactivation of those responsible for the perception of negative stimuli.
