<p>Low-income writers and those without space to work will be prioritised under the RSL’s new Scriptorium awards, with 10 people a year allowed to stay for up to a month</p><p>On the wall of a Ramsgate house owned by Booker winner Bernardine Evaristo hangs a large-scale cover of Virginia Woolf’s A Room of One’s Own. It might just as well read “A Cottage of One’s Own”, as that is precisely what the Royal Society of Literature (RSL) president is offering: writers will be able to stay in the property for free.</p><p>“I bought this cottage as my pension, and I decided that I could put it to use as a writer’s retreat,” Evaristo says. The choice was in part motivated by her own experience – “for many years I didn’t have my own home, I led a very peripatetic lifestyle, and I didn’t earn much money from my writing.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/oct/25/bernardine-evaristo-offers-her-kent-cottage-to-writers-for-free-retreats">Continue reading...</a>
