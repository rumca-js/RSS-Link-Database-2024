It also sounds the part thanks to some genuinely impressive voice acting (although shelling out for some of the \u201990s hip hop that gave the movie its own aural edge clearly wasn\u2019t within the budget). However, despite a visible effort to make Mutants Unleashed a lengthy and credible follow-up story to the film, its simple button bashing action quickly becomes boring thanks to its slim selection of enemies and its constantly reused levels. Trying to do too much with too little means it all just becomes rather\u2026 vanilla, and that\u2019s a shell of a loaded word to use around the green machine, who rock the town without being seen.\"", "id": 1385436, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPZluuecTTw", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 149, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/zPZluuecTTw/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed Review", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-10-25T06:41:24+00:00", "description": "In today's Daily Fix:\nCircana has revealed that not only has EA Sports College Football 25 beaten Madden 25 as the best-selling game of the year (so far), it's now the best-selling football game of all time...based on dollar amount.
