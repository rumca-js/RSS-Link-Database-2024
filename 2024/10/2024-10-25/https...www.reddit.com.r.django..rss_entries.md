I have a CRUD project for a client where his clients would post jobs to the website and his employees can accept jobs and complete them. The jobs have different statuses of: Open, In Progress, Completed, and Canceled. </p> <p>I created a custom admin app in the django project and I am trying to display all the completed assignments/jobs of all the employees of the company. I have already created an assignment app and an employee app in the project. I&#39;ve already created a view to display all the assignments an employee completes for their profile in the assignment app. I&#39;m now confused on where I should create a view to display all the completed assignments across all the employees to display to the admin. I want to do this because I want the admin to review the completed assignment before he can accept the assignment and create an Invoice via an API call with the assignment details

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This post discusses a small but useful quality of life improvement that dropped in Django 5.0: <code>create_defaults</code>.</p> <p>The new <code>create_defaults</code> argument lets you handle creation vs update scenarios elegantly, bringing more power to Django&#39;s object management.</p> <p>Previously, there was a single defaults dict for both creating and updating objects. This led to awkward workarounds and exception handling when you needed different behavior on creation vs update, resulting in code like this:</p> <pre><code>defaults = {&quot;first_name&quot;: &quot;Bob&quot;} create_defaults = {&quot;first_name&quot;: &quot;Bob&quot;, &quot;birthday&quot;: date(1940, 10, 9)} try: obj = Person.objects.get(first_name=&quot;John&quot;, last_name=&quot;Lennon&quot;) for key, value in defaults.items(): setattr(obj, key, value) obj.save() except Person.DoesNotExist: new_values = {&quot;first_name&quot;: &quot;John&quot;, &quot;last_name&quot;: &quo

The same function works for smaller data and correctly loads the static showing that if finished. Is it normal behavior in development mode ? </p> <p>EDIT: Basically, I created a ParquetLoading model that stores a parquet file and I overwrite the save function of the model so that it loads data to a PostgreSQL db for other models when saving the file.</p> <p>Due to having to load large amount of data I use bulk_create (for some models with small data) and Django-Postgres-copy for the largest models.
