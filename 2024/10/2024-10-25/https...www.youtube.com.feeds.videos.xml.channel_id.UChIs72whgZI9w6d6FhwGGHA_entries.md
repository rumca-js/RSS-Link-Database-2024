This review of the Intel Core Ultra 5 245K -- which you can think of like a 15600K -- looks at the gaming performance, production benchmarks, power consumption, and efficiency. Our benchmarks compare the 245K vs. the 5700X3D, 7800X3D, 9600X, 14600K, 285K, and more as we seek to find the best gaming CPUs right now. Intel's new Arrow Lake platform is more efficient with the Core Ultra 200 series, but struggled to find a spot in our recommendations. There are better alternatives to the 245K both above and below it in price, including the 5700X3D (as an upgrade) or most new CPUs. Our 285K review goes into more detail on this as well.
