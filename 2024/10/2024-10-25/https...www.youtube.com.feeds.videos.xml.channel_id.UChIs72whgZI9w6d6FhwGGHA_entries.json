Our benchmarks compare the 245K vs. the 5700X3D, 7800X3D, 9600X, 14600K, 285K, and more as we seek to find the best gaming CPUs right now. Intel's new Arrow Lake platform is more efficient with the Core Ultra 200 series, but struggled to find a spot in our recommendations. There are better alternatives to the 245K both above and below it in price, including the 5700X3D (as an upgrade) or most new CPUs. Our 285K review goes into more detail on this as well.\n\nFind the 285K CPU review & benchmarks here, including all the extra power efficiency explanations: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXLY8kEdR1c\nLearn more about our power testing setup: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmK1rCyKbgQ\n\nThe best way to support our work is through our store: https:/", "id": 1385723, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxXZlONu4Ig", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 428, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UChIs72whgZI9w6d6FhwGGHA", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/WxXZlONu4Ig/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Intel Core Ultra 5 245K CPU Review & Benchmarks vs. 5700X3D, 13700K, & More", "vote": 0}]
