<p>Apple will introduce new Macs and the first services within its Apple Intelligence collection next week. To protect cloud-based requests made through Apple Intelligence, it has put <a href="https://security.apple.com/blog/pcc-security-research/">industry-beating security and privacy protecting transparency</a> in place around cloud-based requests handled by its <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2142244/wwdc-apples-private-cloud-compute-is-what-all-cloud-services-should-be.html">Private Cloud Compute</a> (PCC) system.</p>

<p>Humanoid robots from Tesla can “be a teacher, babysit your kids…, walk your dog, mow your lawn, get the groceries, just be your friend, serve drinks. Whatever you can think of, it will do,” said Elon Musk at this month’s Tesla “We, Robot” showcase in Burbank, CA.</p>



<p>To paraphrase: “Humanoid robots can be human, so you don’t have to!”</p>



<p>It’s a toxic and misguided vision for humanity — let me tell you why.</p>

<p>What a long, strange trip it’s been.</p>



<p>From its inaugural release to today, Android has transformed visually, conceptually and functionally — time and time again. Google’s mobile operating system may have started out scrappy, but holy moly, has it ever evolved.</p>



<p>Here’s a fast-paced tour of Android version highlights from the platform’s birth to present. (Feel free to skip ahead if you just want to see what’s new in the most recent <a href="#android15">Android 15</a> update.)</p>

<p>When the European Commission ruled in 2009 that Intel had broken European Union antitrust laws and fined it €1.06 billion (US$1.44 billion at the time), it was just the beginning of a 15-year saga.</p>



<p>That saga ended Thursday with the European Court of Justice dismissing the Commission’s appeal of an earlier judgement against it, and ordering it to pay all costs. Intel is now off the hook for that billion-euro fine, now worth US$1.15 billion at current exchange rates.</p>



<p>The story began with an investigation into alleged anti-competitive practices by Intel that resulted in the <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/1601034/intel-rolls-ahead-after-antitrust-ruling.html">200

<p>A move by the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to formally launch a probe into Google’s purchase of a $2 billion stake in Anthropic, “sounds like a precautionary investigation across the board to me, primarily due to the fact that the CMA just recently approved Amazon’s Anthropic investment and partnership,” an industry analyst said Thursday.</p>



<p>Scott Bickley, advisory fellow at Info-Tech Research Group, said, “on the surface, the deal with Google seems materially similar in nature. Both Microsoft and Alphabet/Google are now being scrutinized for their respective partnerships with OpenAI and Anthropic by the CMA. The inquiry into Google may merit a closer look, however, in li
