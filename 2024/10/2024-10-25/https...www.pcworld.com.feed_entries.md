<p>Earlier this month, Microsoft finally <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2475992/microsoft-office-2024-is-finally-available-no-subscription-needed.html">released the latest version of Microsoft Office</a> that isn’t tied to Microsoft 365, meaning you can now buy access to the latest versions of Word, Excel, and PowerPoint with a one-time payment instead of shelling out cash on a subscription.</p>



<p>With Office 2024, Microsoft promises improved performance, updated user interfaces, and more tools for analyzing data and embedding images in Excel, as well as support for new features over Office 2021. See all the new features in Office 2024 on <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/what-s-new-in-office-2024-and-office-ltsc-2024-baadecbe-a8fc-4435-8cb8-70e93fd08b56#ID0EBF">this support page</a>.</p>

<p>Samsung isn’t the first name that comes to my mind when I think of affordable gaming monitors. But this deal is an exception. Not only is it pretty dang beefy at 32 inches, it has an upgraded IPS panel. Normally $430, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-DisplayHDR-FreeSync-Adjustable-LS32DG502ENXZA/dp/B0CZPLQZ8P/">Amazon is selling it for just $280 today</a>.</p>



<p>The Samsung Odyssey G50D is a sleek monitor with 2560×1440 resolution, offering a nice bump in pixels over 1080p without going full fat to 4K and overtaxing mid-range gaming PCs or laptops. With a 180Hz refresh rate, it’s plenty fast enough for smooth gameplay on both visually intense single-player games and fast-paced online multiplayer ones.</p>



<p>But that IPS panel is what drew my eye, if you’ll pardon the pun. It’s a richer and more color-accurate alternative to the VA panels yo

<p>Windows 11 might be the most advanced operating system Microsoft has ever put out, but its default features aren’t even the full toolkit.</p>



<p>To unlock some extra features beyond what’s in base Windows, you’ll need to install an optional app called <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/install">Microsoft PowerToys</a> that offers plenty of cool capabilities that you’ll certainly find useful.</p>



<p>Maybe you already know about PowerToys and its more popular features like Image Resize (for right-click resizing images), Keyboard Manager (for remapping certain keys as other keys), Text Extractor (for copying text from images), Peek (for previewing files in File Explorer), and Screen Ruler (for measuring pixels on screen).</p>

<p>The original Lenovo Legion Go hasn’t exactly set the world on fire, but it’s notable as a Steam Deck-style gaming handheld from a major player that isn’t afraid to try new ideas.</p>



<p>And it looks like Lenovo isn’t letting the tepid response to its first model get it down. No less than <em>three</em> new versions of the Legion Go have been spotted in official testing by a regulator.</p>



<p>The Eurasian Economic Commission, a customs body that handles imports for Russia and several partner states, published documentation for the three models. <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/New-Lenovo-Legion-Go-gaming-handhelds-revealed-with-possible-AMD-Strix-Point-variant-in-development.905768.0.html">NotebookCheck spotted the documentation</a>, which mentions model numbers 8ARP1, 8AHP2, and 8ASP2.

<p>Most people prefer to watch films and series from the comfort of their couch on a large television. There’s also a suitable app on a smartphone or tablet for when you’re on the move. However, if you want to make yourself really cozy while watching Netflix, many people reach for their laptop and lie down in bed. That said, watching Netflix directly in your browser can cause problems. </p>



<p>For one, you’re likely to be presented with a poorer picture quality than your subscription actually provides. There are multiple ways to avoid this, which we’ll go over below.</p>

<p>If you’re going to buy Intel’s latest Intel Core Ultra 200S or “Arrow Lake” processors, here’s an important tip: run your system in Windows’ Performance power mode, and consider avoiding upgrading to Windows 11 24H2 entirely. Otherwise, performance could suffer greatly.</p>



<p>Intel confirmed testing by PCWorld and other reviewers that showed that performance dips if applications are run on Windows’ default Balanced power mode. And <a href="https://www.techspot.com/review/2911-intel-core-ultra-9-285k/">TechSpot’s review of Arrow Lake</a> indicates that you’ll see a decent performance improvement while gaming on older versions of Windows 11, versus the latest feature update.</p>

<p>Whether you need expanded storage space on your phone or you need a bigger card for taking photos and videos with your DSLR camera, this deal is for you: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-microSD-MicroSDXC-MB-MD1T0SA-AM/dp/B0CWPNS8JY/">the 1TB Samsung Pro Plus microSD card is on sale for $100 on Amazon</a>. (That’s 17 percent off its usual price and matches the previous lowest price we’ve seen for it.)</p>



<p>This tiny memory card delivers up to 180MB/s read and 130MB/s write speeds, fast enough to capture 4K videos without stutter, whether with your phone, a drone, or a security camera. But the card would also work fine in, say, a Nintendo Switch for games and save files.</p>



<p>The Samsung Pro Plus comes with multiple protections: it’s waterproof (up to 72 hours in seawater), temperature-proof (operating between -13 and 185 degrees Fahrenhei

<p>PC games started out with humble graphics and simple mechanics. Even if you weren’t born in the era of games with as basic graphics as <em>Doom</em> and <em>Wolfenstein 3D</em>, you’d still be aware of how graphics have evolved to the great heights we see today.</p>



<p>It’s why most gamers are wowed when they see games like <em>Forza Horizon 5</em>. The fact that developers can make a game so life-like is quite extraordinary.</p>



<p>Hyper realism, then, is a technical achievement that most gamers will deservedly salute. But by no means does it guarantee a game will be fun and engrossing to play.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="hyper-realism-works-for-some-games">Hyper realism works for some games</h3>

<p>And those graphics are going to look good on this laptop’s 15.6-inch display at a resolution of 1920×1080 and a refresh rate of 144Hz. That’s fast enough to get super smooth frame rates.<

<p>Passwords must be complex and as long as possible so that hackers have no chance of cracking them in a short span of time. However, complicated passwords are easy to forget. Anyone who doesn’t carefully maintain and write down their passwords or store them in the database of a password manager runs the risk of suddenly no longer having access to Windows, protected files, or internet services.</p>
