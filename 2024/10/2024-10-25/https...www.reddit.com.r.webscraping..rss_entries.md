<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I know that I always have to check the robots.txt . But how do I actually know what can I do and how can I do It?</p> <p>I&#39;ll give you an example. Recently a client asked me to scrape restaurants from Foodpanda. I&#39;ve checked the robots.txt and It seems like they wouldn&#39;t like that. But is It actually illegal or It may bring just to IP block (which could be bypassed through proxies in that case)? I don&#39;t want any problems so I just want to understand if I can actually scrape Foodpanda&#39;s restaurant.</p> <p>(Yes, I&#39;m a beginner)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Vinc__98"> /u/Vinc__98 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1gc5lnf/how_do_i_know_if_it_is_legal_scraping_a_website/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1gc5lnf/how_do_i_know_if_it_is_legal_scraping_a_website/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey folks,</p> <p>I’m currently working on a project to scrape auction websites to get the asset information and final price before the auction finishes. I’m new to scraping and still have so much to learn, but thoroughly enjoy it. </p> <p>I’m running this in Python and using Playwright and Beautiful Soup due to website structure. The scrape comprises of several steps, firstly I need to scrape all of the auction listings, this is because the auctions lists always comprise of a URL and importantly a date.</p> <p>This information is then stored in Postgres, which the script will then use to know when to activate the script to start scraping the auction website. This also needs a trigger action to know when to scrape the last bid because they are all on staggered timers and will increase to 5 minutes each time someone bids with the timer lower than 5.</p> <p>My question is, has anyone done anything like this before? Am I going about it the correct way?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi Reddit!</p> <p>I’ve been diving into web scraping and data automation, and I’m trying to build up my skill set so I can eventually start freelancing on platforms like Upwork. Here’s what I’ve tackled so far:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Beautiful Soup</strong> – I can extract data from tables and other elements, structure it, and clean it.</li> <li><strong>Pandas</strong> – I use it to reframe and visualize the data I pull, giving it more structure and making analysis easier.</li> </ol> <p>My learning plan from here is as follows:</p> <ul> <li>Automate downloading of images from websites</li> <li>Move to <strong>Scrapy</strong> for more complex scraping projects</li> <li>Learn <strong>Selenium</strong> for sites that need automation for login or dynamic content</li> <li>Dive deeper into <strong>Pandas</strong> for handling larger datasets and more complex data transformations</li> <li>Start working with APIs (thinking of starting with <strong>Spotify’s AP

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello everyone, I’d like to introduce you to my scraping and data-gathering library, called <strong>DataService</strong>. </p> <p>After being laid off in July, I had some extra time on my hands, so I decided to put it toward creating my first Python library. I started out as a Python developer building web scrapers, so this project was a chance to go back to my roots and pull together what I’ve learned over the years. The library is inspired by <strong>Scrapy</strong>’s <em>callback chain</em> pattern, where a callback function parses a <strong>Response</strong> and can yield additional <strong>Requests</strong>. But unlike <strong>Scrapy</strong>, <strong>DataService</strong> is lightweight and easy to integrate into existing projects.</p> <p>Currently, it includes two clients: one based on <strong>HttpX</strong> for HTTP scraping, and another one based on <strong>Playwright</strong> for JavaScript-rendered content. The <strong>Playwright</strong> c
