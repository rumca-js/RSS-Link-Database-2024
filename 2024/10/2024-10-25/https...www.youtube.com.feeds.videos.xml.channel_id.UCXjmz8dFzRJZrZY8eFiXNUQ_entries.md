Venom should have been a home run.  The legendary Spider-Man villain has an extensive history in comic books, has been adapted to animation, and sells millions of toys.  Buy why, after 4 feature film appearances, have we not gotten a faithful adaptation of Venom?  With Tom Hardy's Venom trilogy coming to a close with less than negative reviews, it begs the question, will we ever get a decent Venom appearance in a movie?  Even more, will Venom ever grace the screen with the MCU's version of Spider-Man?
