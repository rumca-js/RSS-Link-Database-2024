As our project grows, so does the risk of #include bloat; they are easy to add but hard to remove, why so? must it be?\n\nIn this talk, we'll examine a simple yet effective strategy for jettisoning #includes from your projects; we will showcase real-world data, identify common pitfalls and gotchas, and explore the impact of #include optimizations on build times and codebase maintainability. One will be surprised at how many thousands superfluous inclusions there are in a mature million-LOC codebase.\n\nSlides: https://accu.org/conf-previous/accu2024/\nSponsored By think-cell\n---\n\nGabriel Diaconita\n\nA seasoned software developer and C++ enthusiast with over ten years of exp", "id": 1387315, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJjkt_Xg7yo", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 421, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCJhay24LTpO1s4bIZxuIqKw", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/PJjkt_Xg7yo/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "C++ #include on a Diet - Gabriel Diaconita - ACCU 2024", "vote": 0}]
