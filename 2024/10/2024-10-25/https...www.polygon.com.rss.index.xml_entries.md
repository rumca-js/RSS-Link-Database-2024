<p class="has-drop-cap has-text-align-none">The world has never quite known what to do with M. Night Shyamalan. He was <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/out-world-143943">called the next Steven Spielberg</a> just three movies into his career, but when critics and audiences realized he didn’t fit into that box, he was relegated to a punchline for more than a decade before bursting back onto the scene and reminding everyone that he’s always been great. But the truth is, the rise and fall and rise again of M. Night Shyamalan was more a problem with the audience than it was the filmmaker. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23589900/m-night-shyamalan-movie-cameos-explained-haha">Shyamalan’s always re

<p class="has-text-align-none">M. Night Shyamalan’s public reputation has had its ups and downs in the more than 25 years he’s been making movies. While Polygon is using the release of <em>Trap </em>on Max to argue that he’s always been a lot better than people give him credit for, one uncontroversial fact about the director is that his cameos in his movies have always been fascinating.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So, to celebrate the streaming release of his new movie, we ranked Shyamalan’s cameos based on how important they are to his movies and his career. As you might already suspect, importance is a pretty flexible definition, and we’re happy to stretch it in a few different way

<p class="has-text-align-none">Something started to feel oddly familiar to me about 19 minutes into watching <em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/24212250/trap-review-shyamalan-m-night-movie-hartnett" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.polygon.com/24212250/trap-review-shyamalan-m-night-movie-hartnett">Trap</a></em>, the latest horror thriller from director M. Night Shyamalan. The film stars Josh Hartnett as Cooper, a seemingly regular dad that happens to have a secret life as a notorious serial killer, who discovers that the pop idol concert he’s at with his daughter is in fact an elaborate… uh, trap designed by the FBI to arrest him.

<p class="has-text-align-none">After wasting a full decade reducing his greatness to memes about twist endings, the world has rightly come back around on M. Night Shyamalan. But while his critical and commercial reappraisal started in earnest in 2016 with the release of <em>Split</em>, the truth is that Shyamalan never really went away. With the release of <em>Trap </em>on Max, we’re taking some time to go back and look at why the world was wrong to shun him after <em>The Village</em>, and why the movies he made between <em>The Village</em> and <em>Split</em> may be a whole lot better than they’re given credit for. Almost a decade into his comeback tour, it’s time to finally admit that M. Nigh
