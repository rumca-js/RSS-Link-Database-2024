C++ #include on a Diet - Gabriel Diaconita - ACCU 2024
---

C++ modules are the future but, for now, we still have to deal with #include directives - a lot of them...

This directive continues to play an essential role in bringing essential components into our C++ code. As our project grows, so does the risk of #include bloat; they are easy to add but hard to remove, why so? must it be?

In this talk, we'll examine a simple yet effective strategy for jettisoning #includes from your projects; we will showcase real-world data, identify common pitfalls and gotchas, and explore the impact of #include optimizations on build times and codebase maintainability. One will be surprised at how many thousands superfluous inclusions there are in a mature million-LOC codebase.
