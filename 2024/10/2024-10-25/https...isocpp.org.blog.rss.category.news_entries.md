<p>
	Like last year sharing my thoughts on that <a href="https://meetingcpp.com/mcpp/schedule/index.php?src=isocpp">Meeting C++ 2024</a> is the only hybrid C++ conference.</p>
<blockquote>

	From the article:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
		While I&#39;m happy that Meeting C++ 2024 is not the last online conference, I do have once again to wonder if its the last hybrid one.</p>
	<p>
		Once again I&#39;d like to document my thoughts on running a hybrid conference, and also ask the C++ community for the support if you value such an offer being available world wide. In the end the numbers of this years conference will once again decide if I think that continueing is worth it.</p>
	Its easier to run a conference without a live stream...</blockquote>
