<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey, I was just wondering is there a simple way to combine multiple RSS feeds so they display on a webpage in order of latest article? I&#39;m looking to combine multiple sources on a Framer website so people can click through if they want to read more. Ideally have pictures too.<br/> I can only find paid solutions with limits on the amount of views the feeds get, ideally I&#39;d do this via code without the need for a third party service.<br/> Thanks so much.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/andy88jones"> /u/andy88jones </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1gbz8qf/simple_combination_of_rss_feeds/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1gbz8qf/simple_combination_of_rss_feeds/">[comments]</a></span>
