Starting with a simple Bottle application, participants will understand how to move from development to a robust production setup that handles multiple users, implements reverse proxying, and optimizes performance.\n\nThe course begins with setting up a basic Python web app using Bottle, a minimalist web framework. This will introduce the structure and functionality of Bottle applications, demonstrating how to define routes and return simple responses. Students will build a simple app with a random integer feature to visually confirm application updates upon refresh.
