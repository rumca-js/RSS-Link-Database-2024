<p>Apple is reportedly still working on glucose management — this time through software. <em>Bloomberg</em>’s Mark Gurman says the company <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-10-25/apple-secretly-tests-blood-sugar-app-in-sign-of-health-ambitions" data-original-link="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-10-25/apple-secretly-tests-blood-sugar-app-in-sign-of-health-ambitions">tested an app</a> this year for pre-diabetic people, helping them manage their diet and lifestyle. Apple is said not to have plans to launch the app to consumers, but it could play a part in future health products.</p>
<p>The company reportedly tested the app internally, with employees confirmed through a blood test to be at risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. The subjects “actively monitored their blood sugar via various devices available on the market,” logging corresponding glucose changes. The app w

<p>Heads up if you’ve had a Cash App account over the last six years or so: you may now be able to claim thousands of dollars as a result of a class-action settlement. The company proposed the $15 million settlement earlier this year following two security incidents. If you&#39;re eligible to make a claim, you only have a few weeks to do so.</p>
<p>The first related breach took place in December 2021 when, according to Cash App, a former employee downloaded reports containing information on more than 8 million users. This included their full names, brokerage account numbers and, in some cases, the holdings and value of investment portfolios.

The software refresh gives developers much more control over who can join a beta and how new features are shared. It also allows beta testers to get more information about an app before they dive in.</p>
<p>Developers will be able to set all kinds of criteria as to who can or cannot access the beta. This should help devs narrow the test groups to specific audiences, like those using a particular device or OS version. <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:;cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=3cae

The goal of Blumhouse Games was to support a few rad horror titles per year, with a tentative plan to start publishing them in 2025.</p> 
<p>But then, in September 2023, the Blumhouse folks stumbled across <em>Fear the Spotlight</em>. It was a moody, voxelized horror game about two friends sneaking around their haunted high school and communing with the ghosts of students that died in a fire in the ’90s. Spooky shenanigans and mysterious puzzles ensued, all presented in third-person and with a gritty PS One aesthetic. <em>Fear the Spotlight</em> was a PC game made b

<p>If you’re fluent with concepts like <em>release schedules</em> and <em>calendars</em>, you may notice Apple hasn’t updated its computers in a while. It’s nearly a full year since the iMac and MacBook Pro got speed bumps, and just over a year for the Mac Pro and Mac Studio. <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/apple-teases-new-macs-in-a-week-of-announcements-that-starts-monday-165121897.html"><ins>Now, Apple’s head of marketing, Greg Joswiak, has announced an “exciting week of announcements,” from Monday</ins></a>.</p>
<p>It’s easy to assume we’ll see those models getting pushed from variants of the M3 to the M4. Given the M4’s focus on AI, expect plenty of attention on Apple Intelligence, which comes to users as part of iOS 18.1’s update at the same time. That each model is likely to be announced piecemeal across the week, rather than at one glitzy event, suggests we won’t see too many other big changes.</p>

<p>Teaching can often feel like a thankless job, so a good gift can help show that you appreciate someone who’s helped you or your kid learn and grow. It doesn’t have to be anything fancy: A thoughtful thank-you note, perhaps with a gift card, is still a warm way of recognizing everything they do (and is probably worth writing regardless). But if you’re looking for a little something extra, we’ve brainstormed a few gadgets, services and other gift ideas for the educator in your life.</p>

<p>If you want to back up valuable data from your PC, transfer videos to a Mac or offload a few games from your game console, a good external SSD can help. These tiny bricks may cost more than a traditional portable hard drive, but they’re noticeably faster, smaller and far more reliable in the long term.
