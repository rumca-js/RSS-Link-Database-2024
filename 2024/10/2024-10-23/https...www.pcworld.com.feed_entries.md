<p>PowerToys Workspaces is one of the latest additions to Microsoft’s suite of PowerToys apps, as well as one of the simplest and most powerful. It takes just a couple of seconds to set up an arrangement of windows exactly how you want, save it, then launch it all with just a click.</p>



<p>It’s a very easy way to start your day, especially after rebooting your PC or after a long weekend. In fact, I just realized that I — rather stupidly — reproduce what Workspaces does every day, when I could have PowerToys do it for me automatically.</p>



<p>First, a brief recap: <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/563788/seven-ways-in-which-microsofts-powertoys-improves-my-life.html">PowerToys is a collection of free Windows utilities</a>, directly from Microsoft.
