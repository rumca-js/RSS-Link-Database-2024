In other words, I am trying to follow all of the real estate developments, particularly multifamily apartments &amp; townhomes, happening around me. I am trying to create Google alerts with the right key words and then pull those into Feeder using RSS, but I can\u2019t quite seem to find the right combination of key words that pick up everything I am looking for and block out all of the other noise that I wouldn\u2019t want to see. Ideally, this would be repeatable across different towns, municipalities, counties etc in my area. </p> <p>Has anyone done this successfully, or have any insights on if I am going about this the right way? </p> <p>An example of an article that I\u2019d want to see: </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.hartfordbusiness.com/article/southington-site-approved-for-mixed-use-255-unit-apartment-development-sells-for-35m\">ht", "id": 1375299, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1gaa8a4/real_estate_development_tracker_using_rss", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 482, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Real Estate Development Tracker using RSS?", "vote": 0}]
