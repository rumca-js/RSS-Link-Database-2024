<p>‘I gave birth during the pandemic and was cut off from my family. It was just me and my daughter at home. That bedroom was my sanctuary, my place to hide and cry’</p><p>This was taken in the winter, a few months after my daughter’s birth in August 2020. It was during the Covid pandemic. I didn’t have any work and my anxiety levels were very high. I was isolated and my family couldn’t be there for me. It was just me and my child at home. That October, I was diagnosed with postpartum depression. My health visitor prompted me to start therapy. I hadn’t picked up a camera for months and didn’t know where to begin. My therapist suggested I document how I was feeling by writing – but I chose photography. This was the first image I took, and the genesis of a series. To me, my gaze is the longing for home, for community – and for myself. I was lost in that moment, struggling with self-identity, but I also had hope that the light in my heart would come back.</p><p>What I see in the image no

<p>Definitely Maybe spoke to me as a working-class Glasgow teenager and gave me hope. Be Here Now brought it all crashing down</p><p>I was visiting my brother at RAF Chivenor in 1994, where he was based as an armourer. My parents and I had driven from Glasgow for the weekend so they could go for dinner with him and his new girlfriend. I didn’t want to go. Fortunately, my brother knew that and suggested I stay in his room and ransack his music collection.<strong> </strong>“Here, listen to that one first,” he said, handing me a CD. The now unmistakable opening chords of Rock ’n’ Roll Star started. The filthy guitar riff announced the arrival of Oasis in my life, when I was 14.</p><p>When I got back home, I rushed out to buy my own copy of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/article/2024/aug/26/oasis-definitely-maybe-reviewed-1994">Definitely Maybe</a>, the band’s first album. My running trainers, jogging bottoms and Sweater Shop jumpers were replaced by Adidas Sambas, Adidas trac

<p>When people are tricked into sending funds to a fraudster, it’s not just about the money – the shame and stigma of being conned can have a devastating impact on their emotional and psychological wellbeing</p><p>At the height of the first pandemic summer in 2020, I sent more than £18,000 to a scammer. Back then, I’d never heard of the kind of con that ensnared me, though I later learned it was a classic of the genre: a call from my bank’s “fraud team” warning of “suspicious activity” on my account, followed by instructions to move my vulnerable funds into a new “safe” account. Later that night, my housemate stared in horror as I explained the conversation I’d had with a nice man from the bank. “Moya,” he said, aghast. “That was a scam.” By the time I understood what had happened, it was too late. Each of my three bank accounts read £0.00.</p><p>In the weeks that followed, I felt as though my mind was disintegrating. I had struggled sporadically with anxiety for years, but that had a
