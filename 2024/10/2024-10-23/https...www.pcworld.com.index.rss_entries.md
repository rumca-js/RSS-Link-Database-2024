<p>The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is swinging its big, regulatory stick at fake online reviews. Rules <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2428291/the-ftc-is-ready-to-crack-down-on-fake-reviews.html">announced earlier this year</a> are now in effect, banning reviews by fake people, AI-generated text, and those who don’t disclose their status as company insiders or affiliates.</p>



<p>If you spot violations of the new policy, you can report them directly to the FTC, for a maximum fine of $51,744.</p>



<p>The FTC’s updated guidelines for online reviews outlaw six specific types of fakery: reviews from people who aren’t real or use AI-generated text or images, no paid reviews (or other forms of compensation, like those sneaky $10 coupons thrown in with an Amazon shipment), no reviews from employees of the company offering the product or others wit

<p>Arm Ltd. has notified its licensee Qualcomm, informing the company that its architectural license will be terminated in 60 days — the agreement that allows Qualcomm to manufacture the Oryon CPU cores at the heart of the Snapdragon X Elite chip.</p>



<p>PCWorld has independently confirmed an earlier <a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/company-news/2024/10/23/arm-to-cancel-qualcomm-chip-design-license-in-escalation-of-feud/">Bloomberg report</a> that Arm is canceling the architectural license agreement, the agreement that allows Qualcomm to manufacture custom cores, like the company’s Oryon processor. Qualcomm called the cancellation notice “more unfounded threats” and that it looks forward to a trial in December that is set to resolve the issue.</p>
