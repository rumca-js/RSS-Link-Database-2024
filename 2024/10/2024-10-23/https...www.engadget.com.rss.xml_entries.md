<p>Adobe Fresco is Adobe’s painting app, designed to compete with apps like Clip Studio Paint and Procreate.

<p>For me, the iPad Mini is one of those devices I know I <em>should</em> like but can never quite bring myself to actually appreciate.

<p>Two weeks before the US presidential election, the Oversight Board says it has “serious concerns” about Meta’s content moderation systems in “electoral contexts,” and that the company risks the “excessive removal of political speech” when it over-enforces its rules. The admonishment came as the board weighed in on a case involving a satirical image of Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz.</p>
<p>Meta originally removed the post, shared on Facebook in August, that showed an edited version of a movie poster from <em>Dumb and Dumber</em>. The original 1994 movie poster shows the two main characters grabbing each other’s nipples through their shirts. In the altered version, the actors’ faces were replaced by Harris and Walz.</p>

<p>Picking a streaming service these days can feel a lot like picking a show to watch — there are so many options, and each one offers something a little different. Whether you're into binge-worthy TV series, blockbuster movies, live sports or award-winning documentaries, there’s a service tailored just for you. Some platforms, like DirecTV Stream, bundle in news channels and live programming, while others like Fubo focus solely on being the ultimate sports streaming service. And, of course, there are always new shows and exclusive originals that tempt new subscribers to jump aboard Netflix, Max and the like.<br><br>But when it comes to pricing, things can get a bit tricky. While many platforms offer ad-free plans and budget-friendly options with ads, it's worth keeping an eye out for price hikes — a trend that’s becoming more common as streaming giants expand their libraries.
