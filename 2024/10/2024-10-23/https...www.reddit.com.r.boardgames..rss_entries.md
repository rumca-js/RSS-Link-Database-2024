<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know if anyone can really help me here, but I&#39;m near the end of my rope!</p> <p>I backed the Blade Rondo campaign by Japanime Games on Gamefound just over 2 years ago. (<a href="https://gamefound.com/en/projects/japanime-games/blade-rondo">https://gamefound.com/en/projects/japanime-games/blade-rondo</a>)</p> <p>It was the first campaign I ever backed, so I honestly don&#39;t have much experience with crowdfunding, and no other bad ones yet (I&#39;ve had 2 others fulfill since then with no issue).</p> <p>Their updates say they finished fulfillment earlier this year, and I live in the &quot;rest of world&quot; so I expected it to take a bit longer (a US friend received his reward in January).

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Basically, a co-op where you normally beat “the game” (like Pandemic, Horrified) but that also has a great variant so that one player can play as the threat/game/monster.</p> <p>I’m not looking so much for the reverse. Like Heroquest is one vs all and has an app that takes on that role for a fully co-op experience, but I don’t want that. I’m talking about game that is principally a full co-op, but also works great in 1vsAll mode.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/RandomDigitalSponge"> /u/RandomDigitalSponge </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1g9x2ru/are_there_any_good_coop_games_that_also_have_a/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1g9x2ru/are_there_any_good_coop_games_that_also_have_a/">[comments]</a></span>
