I understand the Pi 5 is 5v/5a under 100% CPU and all USB ports maxed but I assume a reasonable load would be 1.5-3a at most.

I got a simple program running to take a picture and save to desktop which was working fine</p> <p>However, seemingly out of nowhere it just stopped recognizing the camera. I&#39;ve literally tried everything I could find online for troubleshooting. </p> <p>When I vcgencmd get_camera, it returns 0 for everything. </p> <p>I bought a new camera today and tried in case I fried the camera. Same thing </p> <p>I&#39;ll admit I messed around with the camera plenty while it was powered on (didn&#39;t know i shouldn&#39;t do that) probably plugged/unplugged while powered.</p> <p>Could I have fried the input on the pi itself?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Mundane-Ad-6276"> /u/Mundane-Ad-6276 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1g9y6zn/camera_module_3_sto
