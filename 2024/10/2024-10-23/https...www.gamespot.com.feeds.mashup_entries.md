<p>The first expansion for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/diablo-4-review-mother-knows-best/1900-6418072/">Diablo IV</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-review-piercing-the-veil/1900-6418298/">Vessel of Hatred</a>, was released earlier this month to critically acclaim from players. Now, Blizzard has found a way to bring a little touch of darkness from the game into the real world by allowing people in Los Angeles and New York to have evil flowers delivered to the special frenemies in your life.</p><p>This sinister Vases of Hatred floral arrangement was designed by celebrity florist Dead Flowers and inspired by the events of the expansion. Within the game, the villain Mephisto has the ability to infect and corrupt plant life and almost anything he touches. The flowers come in a vase that was designed to invoke Nahantu, the newly introduced location in the game that is under Mephisto's control.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="htt
