The computer is kinda on its last legs and I am contemplating moving to a VPS once the computer dies. Currently I use trafik and pihole for local access and wireguard while I am away from home. One of my considerations using a vps is the abillity to restrict access to allowed users. Is there a simple way to allow acces to only users connecting via wireguard?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/trta6782\"> /u/trta6782 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1g9zasv/simple_way_to_restrict_access_to_services_hosted/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1g9zasv/simple_way_to_restrict_access_to_services_hosted/\">[comments]</a></span>", "id": 1372347, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1g9zasv/simple_way_to_restrict_access_to_services_hosted", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 450, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Simple way to restrict access to services hosted on VPS to only users connected via WireGuard?", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-10-23T00:46:12+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;m delving into the world of NAS and want to start with an all-flash NAS by using this <a href=\"https://store.minisforum.com/products/minisforum-ms-01?campaign_id=120205972810430545&amp;ad_id=120205972810480545&amp;variant=44480511246581\">Minisforum MS-01</a> and loading it up.
