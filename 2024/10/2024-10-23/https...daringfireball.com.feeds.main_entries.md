<blockquote>
  <p>If you’re expecting AI fireworks, prepare for AI … sparklers. Back
in June, at the company’s annual developers conference, executives
showed off do-it-yourself emojis, ChatGPT integration and a Siri
that can recall the name of a person you met months ago. Apple has
even been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPe8revsg3k">running ads</a> for some features. None are in this
release.</p>

<p>“This is a big lift,” Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice
president of software engineering, told me at the company’s
headquarters. “You could put something out there and have it be
sort of a mess. Apple’s point of view is more like, ‘Let’s try to
get each piece right and release it when it’s ready.’”</p>

<p>Yes, while other companies rush out generative-AI tools,

<p>Jeffrey Goldberg, in a must-read, must-share piece for The Atlantic (this is a gift link, which should get you through The Atlantic’s subscriber paywall, and which link I encourage you to share with every potential voter you know):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In their book, <em>The Divider: Trump in the White House</em>, Peter
Baker and Susan Glasser reported that Trump asked John Kelly, his
chief of staff at the time, “Why can’t you be like the German
generals?” Trump, at various points, had grown frustrated with
military officials he deemed disloyal and disobedient. (Throughout
the course of his presidency, Trump referred to flag officers as
“my generals.”) According to Baker and Glasser, Kelly explained to
Trump that German generals “tried to kill Hitler three times and
almost pulled it off.” This correction did not move Trump to
reconsider his view: “No, no, no, they were totally loyal to him,”
the president responded.</p>

<p>This week, I asked Kelly about their exchange. He told

<blockquote>
  <p>He said that, in his opinion, Mr. Trump met the definition of a
fascist, would govern like a dictator if allowed, and had no
understanding of the Constitution or the concept of rule of
law. [...]</p>

<p>When Mr. Kelly left the White House in 2019, he decided he would
speak out on the record only if Mr. Trump said something that he
found deeply troubling or involved him and was wildly inaccurate.
Mr. Trump’s recent comments about using the military against what
he called the “enemy within” were so dangerous, he said, that he
felt he had to speak out.</p>

<p>“And I think this issue of using the military on — to go after — American citizens is one of those things I think is a very, very
bad thing — even to say it for political purposes to get elected — I think it’s a very, very bad thing, let alone actually doing
it,” Mr. Kelly said.</p>

<p>Mr. Kelly said that Mr. Trump was repeatedly told dating back to
