<p>One of the most penetrating critics of US racism discusses the reception to his new book and why talking about Palestine offered him a way to understand the world</p><p>Ta-Nehisi Coates’s new book The Message could just as easily have been called Between the World and Me had that title not been taken by his own 2015 bestseller. In The Message, Coates travels to Senegal, South Carolina and Palestine, offering reflections along the way on the African diaspora, US book bans and Israeli apartheid. The result is a work that both digs into the ways that the powerful seek to monopolize storytelling to preserve their privileges and charges writers with the duty to fight back by writing back.</p><p>With the enormous success of his previous books; his many awards, including a MacArthur fellowship and a National Book award; and his celebrated career in journalism, Coates is known as perhaps the most perceptive critic of American racism and an eloquent chronicler of Black life in the United St

The past is what constitutes the bulk of a people’s identity. It is therefore not surprising that one of the biggest trends in contemporary literature centres on the theme of identity. Can there be anything more intolerable than to be told you have no history to speak of and no civilisation, and then to have a new language and civilisation imposed on you? These are the conditions that led to the literary revolt in the literatures of Black people.</p><p>Black writers have a long history of “reclaiming narratives”, the theme of this year’s Black History Month in the UK.

<p>Tangy, creamy and somehow both refined and rustic at the same time, Alsace’s version of <em>coq au vin</em> is a classic in its own right</p><p>This is <em>coq au vin</em> as it’s traditionally prepared in Alsace, where a fruity, local white is more popular than rich, dark reds from farther south – though, in truth, if keenly priced rieslings are thin on the ground, any medium white will do. It’s a tangy, creamy dish that’s perfect for autumn dining, especially if served with plenty of bread or mash to mop up the glorious gravy.</p><p>Prep <strong>15 min</strong><br>

There are hurt feelings, perhaps the makings of a fight, among some fans at the lip of the stage and the Cult’s frontman isn’t having it. “This is a celebration,” he sneers. “If you can’t handle that, go sit in the OAP section, and I fuckin’ mean that.”</p><p>There is no suggestion, during the second show of a tour marking 40 years since the release of the hard rock survivors’ debut LP Dreamtime, that he and his bandmates will be joining them there any time soon. Doing without the usual trappings of such a victory lap – there are no speeches, no video montages, not even a backdrop with their name on it – they rip through a set that suggests they’d prefer to be viewed not as old stagers but as a lean, mean rock band capable of mixing it with artists half their

Springsteen himself is a bit of a cipher, choosing to contribute voiceover bookends which have the staged quality of his Springsteen on Broadway show. In between, his bandmates speak much more off the cuff as they detail the preparations for, and performances on, their first tour after six years away, a gap partly precipitated by Covid.</p><p>There’s an amusing moment early on as they gather for rehearsals, drummer Max Weinberg drily noting that the anthemic She’s the One

On the campaign trail, he diverts every question, no matter what the issue, back to the supposed danger and malignancy of immigrants and the urgency of getting rid of them. The economy? It will be better when there are fewer immigrants competing for jobs, he says. Housing prices? They’ll come down when millions of people are kicked out of the country, he claims. Crime will come down when the immigrants are gone, he says, because murder is “in their genes”.</p><p>Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardi

<p>An actor’s collection of supplementary speeches for Shakespeare’s female characters offers fresh insights into his work</p><p>Harriet Walter takes the title of her book from Romeo and Juliet. Spying Juliet at her window after the Capulet ball, Romeo fervently describes her expressive form: “she speaks”. The next phrase is, however, the more telling: “yet she says nothing”. It’s not literally true: Juliet does speak, famously, of her impatient desire and her willingness to submit herself to near-death for her&nbsp;love, but like almost all other Shakespeare heroines, she does it less&nbsp;than her male counterparts.</p><p>Only in Rosalind, the spirited heroine of As You Like It, striding around the Forest of Arden in doublet and hose and flirting with men and women alike, is there a Shakespearean female character who has the lioness’s share of the play’s lines. More often, women watch, silent. Hamlet’s mother Gertrude, for instance, is on stage for almost half the play but speaks on

<p>A band of rabbits must leave their warren to find safety in a film that, even in a digital age, still has the bloody force to scare young minds</p><p>‘The field … it’s covered in blood!” This is the young visionary rabbit Fiver, voiced by Richard Briers, in the British animation from 1978 by Michael Rosen, based on Richard Adams’s classic children’s book. The rabbits’ warren, quite as important as Tolkien’s shire, is about to be destroyed by a property development, announced by the humans’ heartless wooden sign, which of course none of the rabbits can read, but twitchy, squirming Fiver can sense the disaster it represents.</p><p>So his brother Hazel (voiced by John Hurt) leads Fiver and a breakaway gang on a quest for safety to far-off Watership Down, a rumoured place of sanctuary foreseen by Fiver; they include hot-headed Bigwig (Michael Graham Cox) and later the once hostile Captain Holly (John Bennett), a traumatised survivor of the warren’s destruction.
