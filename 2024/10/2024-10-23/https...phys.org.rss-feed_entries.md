A pair of engineers and a historian have teamed up together to model the means by which the first use of the wheel may have happened. In their paper published in Royal Society Open Science, Lee Alacoque, from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Kai James, with the Georgia Institute of Technology, and Richard Bulliet, from Columbia University, all in the U.S., describe the process that may have unfolded as workers at a copper mine in the Carpathian Mountains sought to move ore more easily from deep within a mine approximately 6,000 years ago.

A team of researchers has for the first time successfully used lasers to generate guided sound waves on the surface of a microchip. These acoustic waves, akin to the surface waves produced during an earthquake, travel across the chip at frequencies nearly a billion times higher than those found in earth tremors.

Using the Purple Mountain Observatory (PMO), Chinese astronomers have observed a mid-infrared interstellar bubble known as N59. They detected multiple cloud-cloud collisions that may be behind star formation processes in this bubble. The findings were published October 17 on the pre-print server arXiv.

Animal tracking studies for ecology and conservation all face technological limitations, such as high costs or the need for tags to remain in close proximity to detectors. In research published in Methods in Ecology and Evolution, investigators describe a solution that can overcome many current limitations by employing the massive global network of personal mobile phones as gateways for tracking animals using Bluetooth low energy beacons.

## Reducing moose numbers could help protect Canadian caribou populations from wolf predation

Woodland caribou populations in Canada are declining because of habitat changes that benefit common prey species of wolves (such as moose and deer), leading to increasing numbers of wolves that kill caribou. To protect caribou, wildlife managers have reduced wolf numbers in some caribou ranges, but this may cause moose populations to grow, resulting in a wolf rebound.

## Availability of parental leave may affect social norms on gender division of childcare
