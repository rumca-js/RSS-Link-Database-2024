Unfortunately, it was also the language feature that took the longest to become widely available for developers to use. This year for the first time we see broad support for the feature in all major compilers and mainstream build system support through CMake. The goal of this talk is to provide you with all the basic knowledge to allow you getting started with C++20 modules today.\n\nWe will take a look at how modules change the build process and why it took so long to implement them. We will take a tour of the essentials of the named modules mechanism and explore the new best practices for physical code structure in a modules-based code base, including how to set up a build with CMake. And last but not least, we will discuss different options for interacting with existing h", "id": 1375003, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twWFfYNd5gU", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 421, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCJhay24LTpO1s4bIZxuIqKw", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/twWFfYNd5gU/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "2024 Update: C++ Modules - C++ Developers Get Started Today! - Andreas Weis - ACCU 2024", "vote": 0}]
