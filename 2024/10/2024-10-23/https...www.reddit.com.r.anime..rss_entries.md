<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello there! Im rather new to anime’s and start to really like them. Watched a few ones already. But im looking for an anime with a female protagonist that isn’t all too cliché girly. Possibly not made for guys to just thirst on… but I take what I can get. I’ve started watching Dan da Dan and really like her character but I really don’t enjoy that horror/all that fighting. I do like romance but as said, not the kind where the protagonist just all out falls for the guy and looses their personality. I like when she has some actual personality.</p> <p>It can also be funny! As long as its not too much fiction/horror. Oh and possibly with english sync?</p> <p>But I loved Saiki K for example despite the fiction. And loved his personality.</p> <p>And as said, im new so i highly appreciate a quick description of your rec&#39;s! </p> <p>Thank you so much for any comments! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/K
