<p>The National Labor Relations Board has accused Apple of infringing on its employees’ rights to advocate for better working conditions. In a <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.nlrb.gov/case/05-RC-352497">complaint</a> spotted by <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-accused-restricting-workers-slack-social-media-use-by-us-labor-board-2024-10-11/"><em>Reuters</em></a>, the agency alleges Apple illegally fired an employee who had used Slack to advocate for workplace changes at the company. Separately, the NLRB accuses Apple of forcing another worker to delete a social media post.</p>
<p>The case stems from a 2021 complaint filed by <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cher-scarlett-appletoo-leaving-apple-085237633.html">#AppleToo co-organizer Janneke Parrish</a>.

<p>The soundtrack to the spider-bot-crawling 1997 <em>Ghost in the Shell</em> game adaptation is coming to the West for the first time. Titled <em>Ghost in the Shell: Megatech Body</em> (as an ode to the Fuchikoma mech you pilot in the game), the soundtrack was produced by Takkyu Ishino. It’s available to <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.iam8bit.com/collections/ghost-in-the-shell">pre-order on iam8bit</a> ahead of its 2025 release.</p>
<p>The PS1 game adaptation had late-90s gamers piloting a spider-like mech (first appearing in the 1991 manga), blasting enemies to smithereens with twin machine guns and guided missiles. Masamune Shirow, the original manga’s author, wrote and illustrated its story and art design.</p>

This allowed the attackers to not only control the robovacs, but use their speakers to hurl racial slurs and abusive comments at anyone nearby.</p>
<p>All of the affected robots were of the same make and model, the Chinese-made Ecovacs Deebot X2s.

On Friday, the team pushed back the game’s release date to Valentine’s Day 2025.</p>
<p>On a game design level, <em>Date Everything!</em> appears to be a simple dating simulator with dialogue branches and voiced characters. What sets it apart is its delightfully absurd premise: You can date all your household objects, thanks to magical glasses known as the “Dateviator.”</p>

<p>At Tesla’s We, Robot event at Warner Bros. Discovery’s studio in California, the company finally unveiled its robotaxi. The car is expected to go into production before 2027, but even Musk caveated that, saying he was “highly optimistic with timeframes.”</p>
<p>The <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/tesla-unveils-its-cybercab-robotaxi-032132013.html">Cybercab</a> doesn’t have a steering wheel and, according to Elon Musk (so pinch of salt!), could be very cheap to run. The Tesla boss said the operating cost of the robotaxi would be 20 cents a mile, 30 to 40 cents with taxes. He also confirmed people can buy one and that Tesla expects to sell the Cybercab for below $30,000. He still, predictably, said something weird. Musk said he envisions a future where people own several robotaxis and manage a fleet like shepherds. Huh?</p>
