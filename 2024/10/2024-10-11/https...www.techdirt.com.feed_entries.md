Last year, Google went after two people in Vietnam, who Google accused of creating at least [&#8230;]

Get ready for some more unexpected uses of the world&#8217;s most controversial facial recognition tech. Clearview has amassed a 10-billion-image database &#8212; not through painstaking assembly but by sending its bots out into the open web to download images (and any other personal info it can find). It then sells access to this database to [&#8230;]

Jonathan Haidt’s incredibly well-timed decision to surf on the wave of a moral panic about kids and social media has made him a false hero for many parents and educators.
