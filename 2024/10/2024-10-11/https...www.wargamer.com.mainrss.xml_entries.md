								<p>If you know <strong>Warhammer 40k</strong>, you know that all its ‘protagonists’ are complete bastards you absolutely shouldn’t invite to a dinner party (whatever Twitter users with Space Marine helmets for profile pictures may tell you). Nevertheless, to spend thousands of hours and dollars painting and playing with Games Workshop’s miniature war criminals, you have to like them a <em>little</em> bit - and reader, I have to confess: I <em>love</em> my <strong>Black Templars</strong>.</p>

								<p>It’s every <strong>Dungeon and Dragons</strong> player’s divine right to goof off, ignore plot hooks, and indulge in maidenless behavior. Similarly, it is every Dungeon Master’s sacred duty to strike back with even greater bullshit - and boy, are the Worst Gnomes some <em>ever-loving bullshit</em>.</p>

								<p><strong>Worms the Board Game</strong> does a remarkably good job taking all the silly weapons, explosive barrels, destructible terrain, and disastrous chain reactions that made the classic multiplayer videogame so enjoyable, and translating them onto the tabletop. Depending on how much chaos you like in your tabletop games, it may soar like a super-sheep, or sink like a concrete donkey.</p>

								<p>Games Workshop, the UK firm behind the <strong>Warhammer 40k</strong> sci-fi setting and tabletop miniature game, is recruiting a new “brand assurance representative” who will ensure licensed animations and interactive projects respect the source material. It’s not clear if the listing aims to fill a vacant post, or is a new role that will enable the firm to handle more and bigger licensing partnerships.</p>

								<p>The <strong>Magic: The Gathering</strong> card High Noon has seen a big price spike of 335%. When the last set was released at the end of September, the Thunder Junction card was the definition of a bulk rare, costing only $1. Now it’s shot up to a much more respectable $4.35, and still looks to be on the rise, thanks to increased play in Pioneer.</p>

								<p>At the presentation where <strong>Sunderfolk</strong> was revealed, I smiled (a little knowingly) as I saw the obvious Gloomhaven inspiration. I frowned as the developers spoke about its plan to make board gaming more accessible, which seemed to boil down to turning them into video games. I audibly hmm-d when I saw that <em>this</em> video game was polluted with a second screen; each player would need their phone in hand to control the game.</p>

								<p>The <strong>Lego Zelda: Great Deku Tree</strong> 2-in-1 set is a perfect tribute to the iconic Legend of Zelda series. The wise Deku Tree, a figure in several Zelda games, including Ocarina of Time and Breath of the Wild, takes center stage in this stunning display. With this set, you can choose between two enchanting designs: a lush green tree featuring Deku Babas and the Deku Sprout from Ocarina of Time, or a cherry blossom version in full bloom, surrounded by Silent Princess flowers and Koroks from Breath of the Wild.</p>
<p>They both capture the beauty of the series, making this a must-have for Zelda fans of all ages. This sense of covering different eras is what makes it one of the <a href="https://www.wargamer.c
