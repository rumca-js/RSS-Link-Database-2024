Even with big discounts, it\u2019s rare for OLED monitors to get within striking distance of their LCD predecessors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today is one of those days. Amazon subsidiary Woot is offering the best price we\u2019ve ever seen on an OLED gaming monitor: <a href=\"https://computers.woot.com/offers/msi-mag-341cqp-qd-oled-monitor-1\">this 34-inch MSI OLED monitor is going for $499.99</a>. That\u2019s less than half the usual price you normally see for an equivalent model.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What\u2019s the catch? Well, Woot\u2019s offer is for a refurbished model \u2014 but don\u2019t let that turn you away. You get a 180-day warranty with this one, which is better than most refurb displays.
