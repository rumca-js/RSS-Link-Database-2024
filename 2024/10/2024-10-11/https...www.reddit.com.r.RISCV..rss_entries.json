Asking for an additional 1/3 the cost of the device for shipping at the last minute feels... deceitful to me. Has anyone here used their products, specifically the ROMA line? Are they worth this level of hassle? I&#39;m really excited to get my first RISC-V CPU, but it&#39;s not starting off on the best footing.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/jarrodcodes\"> /u/jarrodcodes </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1g1knqy/have_questions_about_deepcomputing/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1g1knqy/have_questions_about_deepcomputing/\">[comments]</a></span>", "id": 1309902, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1g1knqy/have_questions_about_deepcomputing", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 471, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Have questions about DeepComputing", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-10-11T12:04:07+00:00", "description": "<table> <tr><td> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1g185hr/dont_starve_running_on_milkv_jupiter_using_box64/\"> <img src=\"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/KIa6y1VbY_rzAZJzwnKWsnb2uEF_iQudvND1Bsq2aRI.jpg\" alt=\"Don't Starve running on MilkV Jupiter using Box64\" title=\"Don't Starve running on MilkV Jupiter using Box64\" /> </a> </td><td> <!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/g7vkwmala4ud1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=edd69bea996c13afbba654a40fee3d7ef1aca790\">Don&#39;t Starve running on MilkV Jupiter using Box64</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/mrksco\"> /u/mrksco </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1g185hr/dont_starve_running_on_milkv_jupiter_using_box64/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1g185hr/dont_starve_running_on_milkv_jupiter_using_box64/\">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>", "id": 1306462, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1g185hr/dont_starve_running_on_milkv_jupiter_using_box64", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 471, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/KIa6y1VbY_rzAZJzwnKWsnb2uEF_iQudvND1Bsq2aRI.jpg", "title": "Don't Starve running on MilkV Jupiter using Box64", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-10-11T11:38:16+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><h2>Editor&#39;s Note</h2> <p>Welcome to the sixty-third issue of the SG2042 Newsletter.
