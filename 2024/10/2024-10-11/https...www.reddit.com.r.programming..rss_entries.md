<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello, everyone! I&#39;d love to share something I made!</p> <p>I&#39;ve been fascinated by linear logic and session types for a while and found it sad it&#39;s not really applied in practice. There is a lot of wonderful research on how concurrency can be made structured and robust this way, here are some papers I&#39;d recommend:</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2364527.2364568">Propositions as sessions</a></li> <li><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3371086">Par means parallel: multiplicative linear logic proofs as concurrent functional programs</a></li> <li><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3473567">Client-server sessions in linear logic</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0890540117300962?via%3Dihub">Session types revisited</a></li> </ul> <p>The reason seems to be it&#39;s hard to design libraries, or even languages, that employ these concepts in an ergonomic and easy to use way.<
