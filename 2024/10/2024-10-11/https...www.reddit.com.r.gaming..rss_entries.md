<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Was recently discussing how robot characters in games are badly designed. Take Bastion from Overwatch. If I&#39;m designing a robot made for battle, I&#39;m not giving it the same weak spots as humans. Humans would naturally aim for headshots. Because of this I would put the weak point somewhere else on the body. I think it would be a very interesting concept for a game to have different weak points depending on the type of character. Are there any games that have attempted this before?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Dwn_Wth_Vwls"> /u/Dwn_Wth_Vwls </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1g1fwjk/are_there_any_games_particularly_online/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1g1fwjk/are_there_any_games_particularly_online/">[comments]</a></span>
