<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>There’s a podcast titled “We are not afraid” that was pulled by Spreaker for violating their standards (made multiple death threats and threatened to send Westboro Baptist Church to kill drag queens at a gay club). But the podcast is still up on Apple and Spotify. Can anyone help find where it’s being hosted. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/yes-maam1973"> /u/yes-maam1973 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1g1a0hn/how_to_identify_a_podcast_hosting_provider/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1g1a0hn/how_to_identify_a_podcast_hosting_provider/">[comments]</a></span>
