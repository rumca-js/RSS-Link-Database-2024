While I already have a unused SFF computer I noticed that it will not be very suitable for this solution due to a processor with a high TDP which is not compensated by any significant performance. (anyway) </p> <p>As an alternative, I searched the internet and came across 2 options.<br/> The first is the AOOSTAR R1 with an Intel N100 processor in a version without SSD and RAM which I will complete myself. The second is the ODROID H4+, which will require me to pay DUTIES and print some case with 3d printer. </p> <p>Which will be better suited if my requirement is to make a server for small hosted applications and archive for all my data (e.g. 12+12tb mirrored). Which would you guys choose if it were me?

I bought one with built-in RAID functionality, but that left me debating something: Should I RAID at the enclosure-level, or configure it in the Pi? </p> <p>The former would reduce cpu overhead since the enclosure will handle the raid configuration management, but I think using the enclosure would also make me blind to any smart errors or problems that happen, which increases the risk of unexpected data/disk failure. </p> <p>The big drawback to the latter is that this is a fairly resource-constrained design, and so adding the need for it to do RAID calculations might just make it unworkable. </p> <p>* Please don&#39;t try to talk me

## PSA: A reverse proxy does not automatically increase your security

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I frequently see &quot;Use a reverse proxy&quot; as a suggestion when someone asks how to secure their server. A reverse proxy, on its own, will not increase your security. I think this is potentially harmful as it gives a false sense of security if you think that just by adding a reverse proxy you&#39;ve increased your security.</p> <p>Say you have a web app that contains a vulnerability. It makes zero difference whether that web app is exposed directly, or there&#39;s a reverse proxy in front of it - the reverse proxy is just going forward any packets it receives on to the application behind it, and will not prevent the application from being exploited.</p> <p>When someone recommends a reverse proxy as a security solution, they might mean a SaaS such as Cloudflare. Calling a Cloudflare a reverse proxy is like calling Walmart a general store; it&#39;s technically correct, but Cloudflare is also a lot <em>more</em> than a reverse proxy. It&#39;s also

Unfortunately, my Pi broke, so I recently got a Dell Wyse 5070.</p> <p>Now, I’m looking to set up Plex, Jellyfin, and maybe try out a few other things like Paperless and using an external USB drive as NAS storage for Plex and other services.</p> <p>However, I keep reading about Proxmox, and I’m not sure I fully understand why I would need it. Can’t I just install Ubuntu Server and run Docker with Portainer again? What are the specific advantages of Proxmox in my case? I understand that Proxmox allows running multiple OSes in VMs, but what would that bring me? If I’m already running my services in separate Docker containers, isn’t that good enough isolation?</p> <p>One thing that sometimes annoyed me with Docker was setting up the

And the big question mark for me is how secure is my home server? I am scared to not take enough precautions there or to not know enough…</p> <p>What are the best practices for home server security ? What tools do you use? Or even hardware ? How do you check/monitor for potential intrusions into your network or rogue apps? (I saw a post here few days ago from someone that got a crypto mining software installed on his home server…)</p> <p>As of right now. I have plex, the arr suite installed, pi-hole, wireshark vpn, vaultwarden, nginx and that’s pretty much it. Everything is a docker container. Only vaultwarden and plex are exposed with port forwarding on my router but I use nginx and duckdns to redirect the traffic to it and only have port 443 open. In your opinion is it good enough ? Thanks for your help 😄</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32;
