The IO_uring asynchronous I/O API for Linux is quite novel and has proven performance benefits. With time IO_uring has been adapted to other areas of the kernel like networking and now with a proposal raised by an Arm graphics driver engineer, it could potentially be adapted for use by Direct Rendering Manager (DRM) kernel graphics drivers...

Now past the launch day for the AMD EPYC 9005 series server processors and having delivered initial AMD EPYC Zen 5 benchmarks for the EPYC 9575F / EPYC 9755 / EPYC 9965 SKUs, it's onto one of my favorite areas of testing and that is the more focused benchmarks looking at different specific changes/features of new processors. Today under the benchmarking microscope is looking at the new AVX-512 512-bit data path capabilities of 5th Gen AMD EPYC compared to using a 256-bit data path or disabling AVX-512 entirely.
