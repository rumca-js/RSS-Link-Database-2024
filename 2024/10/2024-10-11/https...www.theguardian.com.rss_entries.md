## Johnson on target again but Iceland hit back to rescue draw against Wales

<p>With 29 minutes showing on the big screen behind the running track, Wales were 2-0 up and coasting to victory in Iceland but just as Craig Bellamy was beginning to make this management lark all look rather straightforward, a concerning ­second-half collapse proved there is still plenty of room for improvement.</p><p>Brennan Johnson nudged in on the goalline to score his seventh goal in seven games before Harry Wilson doubled Wales’s lead, but after the break Iceland asked questions of ­Bellamy’s side and they wilted rather feebly under the pressure of finding answers. Logi Tómasson, a half-time substitute, had a hand in two goals in three second-half ­minutes to level things up and Jón Dagur ­Thorsteinsson almost completed the comeback but his curled shot cannoned off a post with a minute of normal time remaining.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/11/iceland-wales-nations-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<ul><li>Captain will take on New Zealand for America’s Cup</li><li>‘The fact that Britain has never won is what drives us’</li></ul><p>There were 15 boats in the very first race for the Royal Yacht Squadron’s £100 Cup back in 1851, 14 British, and one not. The odd one out was a 101ft schooner named America, which had been built in New York, and brought across especially to show off the prowess of US shipbuilders. It arrived, in the words of one writer, like a sparrow hawk among a flock of wood pigeons. As every young English sailor learns at his grandfather’s knee, the story goes that when America came into sight at the end of the 53-mile (98km) race around the Isle of Wight, Queen Victoria, watching from the Royal Yacht, turned to a signalman and asked who was in second place behind it. “Your Majesty,” he is supposed to have said back to her, “there is no second.”</p><p>America won that first race by 24 minutes, and, the best part of 200 years later the British still have not come cl

Her baked goods were truly one of a kind, and these biscuits – slightly flat, crisp and filled with silky chocolate – became quite popular. This version is quite different to traditional <em>izmir bomba</em>; I wanted a dough that was easy to work with, quick to put together, and with a homemade filling.

But bringing fresh authenticity to Shakespeare’s storied tragedy was not without its challenges</p><p>“What do you do when you&nbsp;have a terminal illness?

For the pair, who wrote the adaptation together, the answers to those core questions inform the whole play. “In Richard’s case,” says Patrick, “he tries to become king.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2024/oct/11/lyric-belfast-richard-iii-michael-patrick-oisin-kearney">Continue reading.

Its unfortunate associations with red-trousered, red-nosed, Colonel Blazer types also makes it possibly the most unfashionable of drinks, but, as well as being a traditional essential with the festive cheeseboard, port is a diverse category that deserves attention at other times of year, too.</p><p>Dry white port, for example, is a useful standby to keep in the fridge, to serve with tonic or ginger ale for a lower-alcohol alternative to a G&amp;T, or in place of vermouth in an outre martini, or to serve over ice alongside a plate of green olives.

<p>If we treated this service as vital state infrastructure, it could make a huge difference to parents – and to the economy</p><p>You can’t get much for £5.50 nowadays. A takeaway coffee and a muffin, maybe; a pint and a packet of crisps, outside London. But in parts of Canada, roughly that amount can buy you a day’s childcare. Or it can, at least, if you can find a nursery place.</p><p>The country is now three years into a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/19/canada-budget-child-care-covid-19-relief">post-pandemic social experiment</a>, offering parents heavily (and expensively) subsidised childcare for what is by envious British standards a staggeringly cheap C$10 a day. The idea is that ultimately this multibillion-dollar state programme will pretty much pay for itself, thanks to the boost in GDP expected to be provided by more parents going out to work. But arguably, its biggest insight has been treating childcare less as some kind of perk the state sadly can’t

Which of the world’s three current major wars has resulted in the most deaths?

It’s a deadly serious fact-based tale about a serial killer in the US in the 1970s, which is careful to give his female victims equal billing. Kendrick plays Sheryl, an aspiring actor who is hired for TV show The Dating Game – the same episode on which, bizarrely, multiple murderer Rodney Alcala (an alternately charming and creepy Daniel Zovatto) has been picked as one of the eligible bachelors. Skilfully woven into that are the stories of other women who crossed Alcala’s path, in a tense, chilling tale of personal tragedy and damning police failure. <em><br>

<p>Becoming a true superstar after his 2008 Wimbledon triumph, the Spaniard has been the ultimate role model</p><p>There are some moments in sport that stand above all others. For Rafael Nadal, that moment came in the early evening at Wimbledon in 2008. With natural light fast running out, Roger Federer’s final forehand landed in the net and Nadal fell on his back, joy unconfined. At 22, the Spaniard was Wimbledon champion, something he – and many others – had thought might be beyond him.</p><p>In that instant, Nadal became a true superstar. Already virtually unbeatable on clay, the idea that he might be able to beat Federer on the Swiss’s favourite surface, where he had won five times in a row, seemed fanciful. But Nadal turned tennis logic on its head, for good. Two years later he won Wimbledon for a second time and when he won the US Open later the same year. He was only the seventh man to complete the career grand slam of all four majors, and the youngest in the Open era.</p> <a h

<p>In 1979, another incoming prime minister struggled to satisfy the public hunger for change</p><p>“When we asked for your vote,” said the prime minister, “we didn’t promise you instant sunshine. We pointed out … that a nation can’t accelerate downhill for years and then … suddenly return to prosperity … We had to start … the long, slow climb back up the hill to recovery. I’m afraid some things will get worse before they get better.”</p><p>When Margaret Thatcher said these words in a party political broadcast <a href="https://www.margaretthatcher.org/document/104325">in March 1980</a>, her government, like Keir Starmer’s, was months old but already unpopular.

<p>Spain’s cult hero on the injury layoff that revived his career, not taking football too seriously and Chelsea’s resurgence</p><p>“Before it was Ronaldinho and now it’s people like&nbsp;… well, me,” Marc Cucurella says, and then there is laughter. With him there is a lot of laughter. All of a sudden the Chelsea defender is a European champion and cult hero, and you can see why. There’s the hair: massive, as the song says, and in the right light still a bit red, celebratory dye not entirely washed out three months after Spain won Euro 2024. There’s the playing style that helped take them there, “one people empathise with”. And there’s the personality.

In a recently constructed house, rebuilding is generally a lesser amount than the market price, since bricks and mortar are comparatively cheap materials.
