<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I preordered the DC ROMA Pad II for $299 this summer, and while I expected there to be a shipping cost, it wasn&#39;t until last week that I got a last minute request to send an additional $110 for shipping. Asking for an additional 1/3 the cost of the device for shipping at the last minute feels... deceitful to me. Has anyone here used their products, specifically the ROMA line? Are they worth this level of hassle? I&#39;m really excited to get my first RISC-V CPU, but it&#39;s not starting off on the best footing.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/jarrodcodes"> /u/jarrodcodes </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1g1knqy/have_questions_about_deepcomputing/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1g1knqy/have_questions_about_deepcomputing/">[comments]</a></span>
