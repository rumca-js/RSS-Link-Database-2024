However, the lack of follow-ups to Dragon Ball: Budokai Tenkaichi 3, which launched in 2007 for the PS2 and Wii, has been conspicuous. But the wait is over with the arrival of Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO.\n\nAvailable on October 11th for Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC, it offers new modes, and some fresh mechanics on top of the addictive gameplay. There are some rough edges here and there, like some presentation elements and missing battles in Episode Battle.\n\nNevertheless, Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO is a worthy successor to the Budokai Tenkaichi 3. Whether you're playing online for some Destruction Point Battles, or completing challenges, it's an enjoyable homage.\n\nNote: A copy of this game was purchased by us.", "id": 1308676, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGKFatf47Hs", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 129, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/tGKFatf47Hs/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Dragon Ball Sparking!
