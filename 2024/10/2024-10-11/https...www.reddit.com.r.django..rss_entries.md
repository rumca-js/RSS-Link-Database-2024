<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi, i have a PHP and Java background, i recently started using django to build a basic weather app just to learn the framework. i found out that django doesn&#39;t provide a container or binder, so i presume that in python we are supposed to avoid tight coupling some other way. what is the convention to inject an helper class in another? should i use a different paradigm all along? i&#39;ve thought of constructing them in the __init__.py, but that feels wrong to me. for now i&#39;m simply passing an instance of the object i need when i construct the object in the views file.</p> <p>pretty much like that</p> <pre><code>Weather(NeededHelperClass(), other_param) </code></pre> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Ok_Beach8495"> /u/Ok_Beach8495 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/1g1johj/dependency_injections_in_djangopython/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.red

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi, Maybe someone here can help. I&#39;m migrating a project between two VMs and DBs. Everything went smooth except migrating db structure. I have a completely fresh DB and wanted to make fresh migrations, but when I try to the compiler is giving me a 42S02 odbc error, saying that it couldn&#39;t find a table corresponding to a model. Well it shouldn&#39;t find it, it&#39;s a fresh database... I tried precreating this one table, which allowed for makemigration, but when migrating it threw an error, that a table already exists... Even if I pointed in the model that this table already exists and repeated the process it didn&#39;t work...</p> <p>I&#39;ve been clearing migrations folder, but might there be a hidden migration log somewhere?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/KokonSensei"> /u/KokonSensei </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/1g15hff/django_migration_error/">[li
