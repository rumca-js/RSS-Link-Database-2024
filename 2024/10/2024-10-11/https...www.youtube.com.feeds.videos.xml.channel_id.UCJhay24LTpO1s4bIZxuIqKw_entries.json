I'm trying to be productive!\n\nThere seems to be a general fear of deleting old code. I hope to allay that fear.\n\nThis talk is a fairly personal view about mindset, process, techniques, technical debt, relentless refactoring, and overall, \"doing the right thing\". It is not language specific, although all the examples will be in C++.\n\nSlides: https://accu.org/conf-previous/accu2024/\nSponsored By think-cell\n---\n\nMatthew Jones\n\nMatthew has been paid to write software for over 30 years, mostly in C++. After a variety of jobs, and a spell contracting he now works on Formula 1 driving simulators.\n\nHe", "id": 1306702, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApUPEsrqfYk", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 421, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCJhay24LTpO1s4bIZxuIqKw", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/ApUPEsrqfYk/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "How to Delete Code - Matthew Jones - ACCU 2024", "vote": 0}]
