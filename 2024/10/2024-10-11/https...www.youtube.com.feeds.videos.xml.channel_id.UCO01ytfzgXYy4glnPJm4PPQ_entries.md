Today on the Matt Walsh Show, one of the top public schools in the country sold its blueprints – and everything else – to the communist Chinese government. This raises a couple of questions. First, how is that legal? Second, why did they send the school's whole program, except the DEI stuff? Also, the governor of Michigan appears in a bizarre TikTok video that appears to mock the Catholic faith. A new ad meant to persuade men to vote for Kamala is having very much the opposite effect. Elon Musk unveils the fleet of robots that will take over the world and enslave us. And the new Joker movie may wind up being one of the worst flops in Hollywood history. What exactly went wrong?
