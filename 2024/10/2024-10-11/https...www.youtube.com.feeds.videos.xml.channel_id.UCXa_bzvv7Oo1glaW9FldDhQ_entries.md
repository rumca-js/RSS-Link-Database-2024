There have been numerous Dragon Ball titles over the decades, some leaving a bigger impact than others. However, the lack of follow-ups to Dragon Ball: Budokai Tenkaichi 3, which launched in 2007 for the PS2 and Wii, has been conspicuous. But the wait is over with the arrival of Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO.

Available on October 11th for Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC, it offers new modes, and some fresh mechanics on top of the addictive gameplay. There are some rough edges here and there, like some presentation elements and missing battles in Episode Battle.

Nevertheless, Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO is a worthy successor to the Budokai Tenkaichi 3. Whether you're playing online for some Destruction Point Battles, or completing challenges, it's an enjoyable homage.

Europa is a new 3D platformer developed by Chozabu and Novadust Entertainment. The game features visuals that have been quite heavily inspired by the works of Studio Ghibli, while also hoping to offer a calm, fun platforming experience where players won’t be bothered by enemies. 

The game features simple puzzles that are easy to figure out and it doesn’t push players to be stuck on a specific challenge, focusing more on exploring the downright gorgeous world. It also tells a story of a long-dead kingdom through its use of collectibles, as well as environments.

After the critical success of Silent Hill 2 Remake, the question, of course, is this- what's next for Bloober Team and Konami? And cutting right to the chase, we can probably safely assume that Silent Hill 2 isn't the last time the two will be collaborating on the psychological horror franchise. 

There is, in fact, a very good chance that Bloober Team is going to develop another Silent Hill remake, which is something that the studio has strongly hinted at on a couple of occasions.
