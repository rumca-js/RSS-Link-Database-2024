Yes, that probably is quite the understatement. With over a billion dollars spent acquiring the rights to material based on Tolkien\u2019s incredible world and the first since Peter Jackson\u2019s universally loved Lord of the Rings trilogy, there were high expectations and for some, the first season didn\u2019t quite live up to those lofty expectations. The Rings of Power S2 had the daunting task of continuing the tale of Sauron\u2019s mission to create the titular rings and the efforts of Galadriel and Elrond to stop him with many fans unsure if the Amazon series could live up to their expectations. Firstly, I have to say that I love being in Tolkien\u2019s fantasy world and whilst the first season of The Rings of Power didn\u2019t blow me away, I was able to appreciate just being able to watch a TV show based on Middle-earth in the time before Lord of the Rings. The Rings of Power S2 feels like an upgrade on the first season but those negative voices will", "id": 1305047, "language": "en-AU", "link": "https://www.grimdarkmagazine.com/review-the-rings-of-power-season-2", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 137, "source_url": "https://www.grimdarkmagazine.com/feed", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "REVIEW: The Rings of Power Season 2", "vote": 0}]
