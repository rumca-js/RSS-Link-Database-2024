<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So my 5 year old son and I have been playing games for a few years, and although he can&#39;t read yet, he has really been able to pick up the concept of many board games. </p> <p>Our main games that he can play and I still find interesting are Quacks of Quedlinburg Century golem edition And most recently to my surprise, 7 wonders duel. I made some minor tweaks to the game but he got it on the first play.</p> <p>But, he&#39;s a kid and doesn&#39;t really enjoy me beating him, so I&#39;m wondering if there are any coop games for adults that have no reading. We have played some kids games like outfoxed, and kids chronicles but I&#39;m hoping for something a little bigger. Also if it includes minis or fighting it&#39;s a major plus, because we love painting and fighting </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Serious-Run-6165"> /u/Serious-Run-6165 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgame

Then it generally turns into one person pointing and doing math while the others listen, and it becomes complicated with some of the expansions (especially multiple piers on a single island...). </p> <p>I had the idea to start keeping a bunch of dice with the game, and that has been working out great. As tiles are explored we can add dice directly on the tiles, with the actual score, so it&#39;s just easy addition at the end of the game. </p> <p>I also created a 3d insert to accommodate the game with Ships and Shores expansion as well as dice, the stl files are available here (free): <a href="https://www.printables.com/model/1035799-storage-insert-compatible-with-beacon-patrol">https://www.printables.com/model/1035799-storage-insert-compatible-with-beacon-patrol</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a hre

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi, as the title says I’m looking for games that can be used as fun complimentary aids to help teach a group of middle schoolers english as a second language. The main goal is to get these students to interact with each other using basic sentences, to make them more comfortable speaking. It’s an added bonus if the game can improve their vocabulary and grammatical understanding in sneaky ways. </p> <p>The games need to be fairly lightweight and quick-played. </p> <p>The best contender I have so far is &quot;That’s not a hat&quot;. Word association games in the vein of &quot;Codenames&quot; are probably too hard for their, as of now, limited vocabulary. </p> <p>I’m thankful for any suggestions! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/should_have_been"> /u/should_have_been </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1g18256/simple_interactive_boardgames_to_help_teach_basic/">[link

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi! I used to play some wargames from GMT almost a decade ago. Among them, there were Here I Stand and Napoleonic wars. I want to return to this complex political game for several players, but I don&#39;t have a suitable game group, so I probably have to create one on my own. </p> <p>My initial thought was about Here I Stand because I really enjoy the period, and now I&#39;m living in Berlin, which makes it even more exciting. But somewhere on the Internet, I found that Tanto Monta is &quot;a new&quot; HIS. </p> <p>I did a very simple check and downloaded rulebooks for both HIS and Tanto Monta, and it is 48 vs 64 pages. Does it mean that Tanto Monta is even more complex than HIS? </p> <p>Then I remembered the pretty old game Sword of Rome. I heard all good about it back in the day but never had a chance to try it. I also downloaded its rulebook, and it is only 24 pages. Can it be a good candidate for the group of beginners? Does it age well? </p> <p>S

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>One of ours is our first game of War of the Ring. We were assiduously setting up, placing all the minis, learning the place names with excitement. I was playing Free People and my head was down and tunnel vision was on as i carefully placed my elves in elf land and dwarves in dwarf kingdom, satisfied and double checking myself that all races were placed. I was paying no attention to my opponent and when i excitedly said &#39;Finished!&#39; and lifted my head to see where she was at and saw this HORDE OF ORCS swarming out of Mordor and beyond. It was almost a table flip at the unbalanced nature of it and an explosive WHAT THE FUCK!!! moment that recalling it still makes us giggle.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/chomoftheoutback"> /u/chomoftheoutback </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1g0zbks/whats_a_board_game_moment_youll_never_forget_and/">[link]</a></span> &#
