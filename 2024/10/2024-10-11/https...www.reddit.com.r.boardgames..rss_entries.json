I want to return to this complex political game for several players, but I don&#39;t have a suitable game group, so I probably have to create one on my own. </p> <p>My initial thought was about Here I Stand because I really enjoy the period, and now I&#39;m living in Berlin, which makes it even more exciting. But somewhere on the Internet, I found that Tanto Monta is &quot;a new&quot; HIS. </p> <p>I did a very simple check and downloaded rulebooks for both HIS and Tanto Monta, and it is 48 vs 64 pages. Does it mean that Tanto Monta is even more complex than HIS? </p> <p>Then I remembered the pretty old game Sword of Rome. I heard all good about it back in the day but never had a chance to try it. I also downloaded its rulebook, and it is only 24 pages. Can it be a good candidate for the group of beginners? Does it age well? </p> <p>S", "id": 1306039, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1g167op/picking_politicalcarddriven_wargame_from_gmt_here", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 473, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Picking political/card-driven wargame from GMT.
