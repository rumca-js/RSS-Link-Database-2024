<p>Donald F. Trump, yesterday in Detroit:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Do you like autonomous? Does anybody like an autonomous vehicle?
Know what that is? Right? When you see a car driving along? Some
people do, I don’t know. A little concerning to me, but the
autonomous vehicles we’re going to stop from operating.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This, on the very day Tesla was set to hold a high-profile event to promote autonomous vehicles. This, after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/07/style/elon-musk-donald-trump-campaign-rally.html">Elon Musk dropped to his knees and begged</a> for Trump’s approval — <em>exactly</em> as <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/108636743295734643">Trump predicted Musk would</a> — at one of Trump’s Hitlerjugend rallies just last week.</p>
