Why are the “adults” in the room advocating against fair play? </p><p>These are reasons that the left cannot explain, which is why students are not dumb enough to fall for the lie that boys in girls' sports is somehow the “compassionate” thing to do. So it only makes sense that high school students all over the State of New York will protest male athletes intruding in female sports two weeks before the

If Trump will start the next world war, why are we closer than ever before to armageddon? If Trump won’t fix the economy, why did he fix it before and why is it abysmal now? If Kamala plans to fix these things, why doesn't she fix them while she is the de facto president? </p><p>These are questions the press would never ask, as they give her a pass while she campaigns against her record. So while the left accuses Trump of being everything he isn't and everything they are, Howard Stern decided to ass

Yeah, I know it's just called "The Garden" now, but I'm an oldhead and it will always be MSG for me. There are people who think it's a waste of time because it's in New York, and there are people who think this means "NY is in play." They're both wrong, though the people who think it's a waste of time are much wronger in their wrongness.</p><p>There are two reasons why the state isn't and never will be in play: Manhattan and Brooklyn.
