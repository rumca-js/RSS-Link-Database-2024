It led him back home, to capture a side of contemporary Australia you won’t see in Crocodile Dundee.</p><p>When Ferguson started taking portraits around Australia in 2013, people would occasionally ask him where he was from. He grew up in Dubbo, but his years as a US-based photojournalist for the New Yorker, Time, National Geographic and the New York Times had apparently sanded the strine from his accent. He had been asking himself similar kinds of questions – about his place in the world, and the stories his camera captured.</p><p>Chairs secured from flooding, Iningai Country, Lake Huffer Station, Queensland, 2017.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2024/oct/12/photogra

<p>Extracted from the vast US oilfields comes a pungent, heavy and energy-packed sound. Are noisenik outsiders Chat Pile about to become the region’s biggest export?</p><p>A few weeks ago, a new billboard appeared in downtown Oklahoma City. Positioned atop a nondescript Mexican restaurant advertising “OKC’s Best White Queso and Margaritas,” the advert featured a fisheye photo of a group of scruffy-looking men standing in front of an enormous cross. White letters spell out a cryptic message about the impending release of Chat Pile’s new album, Cool World. All the other ads nearby are for ambulance chasing lawyers and medical marijuana, emphasising how odd it is to see Chat Pile, a gnarly noise rock band, getting the same sky-high treatment. The billboard marks yet another unexpected landmark in the quartet’s rise from hobbyists to heavy music stars. “I feel like the label did it just because they knew we would think it’s funny,” chuckles guitarist Griffin “Luther Manhole” Sansone as we

<p>Her ‘dignity’ has won over the nation, but the way we think about male violence must not depend on a ‘perfect victim’</p><p>Since the beginning of September, the face of a woman from a small village in the south of France has been splashed across global front pages. Gisèle Pelicot is the central figure in a trial in which the main defendant is her ex-husband Dominique Pelicot. He <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/17/dominique-pelicot-france-rape-trial-testimony">has admitted</a> that for nearly a decade, he drugged her and invited other men to allegedly also abuse her, in her own bed, without her knowledge, so that he could film them doing so. Fifty other men are on trial alongside Pelicot, accused of rape, which many of them deny.</p><p>Against the scale of the atrocities that it is alleged she has endured, Gisèle Pelicot cuts an unusual figure as she attends the trial. Head held high, in neat and polished attire, she walks tall into the courthouse in Avignon, a

<p>Pull on your walking boots and immerse yourself in magnificent scenery on these long-distance trails, chosen by our tipsters</p><p>The best ever walk I’ve been on was actually two weeks of walking, along the <a href="https://www.lasenda.net/guide-gr11-spanish-pyrenees/">GR11</a> on the Spanish side of the Pyrenees from Candanchú to La Guingueta d’Àneu. We got the train to France, packed food for a week and restocked half way, and wild camped each night. So not only was it the best trip ever, it was also cheap and eco-friendly. Each evening we’d camp by a lake, and start our day with an (incredibly bracing) dip. It is so incredibly beautiful and peaceful, and there’s lots of friendly refuges along the way if you want a chat, a bed and hot food. The route is challenging, but doesn’t require any specialist equipment. At the end, all I wanted to do was carry on walking. <br><strong>Rachel</strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2024/oct/11/readers-favourite-long-distnc
