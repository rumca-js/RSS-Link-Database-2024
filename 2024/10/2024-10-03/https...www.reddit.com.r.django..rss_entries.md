<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey there, I&#39;ll try to keep this post short.</p> <p>For 2 days I&#39;ve been stuck on step 1 of trying to create a proper user model, because I don&#39;t want the platform to use usernames for authentication, but use emails, like a proper modern day application, without requiring a username that no one else is going to see. Everything I come up with seems insecure and &quot;hacked together&quot;, all the resources I&#39;m looking for on this specific topic do everything in very different ways so in the end I encounter errors in different places which are a pain to debug. It &#39;just feels&#39; like I&#39;m taking wrong approaches to this problem.</p> <p>Can anyone point me to a good resource if you encountered this problem in the past? I just want to get rid of the username field and be confident that user privileges are properly configured upon simple user and superuser creation.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https:/
