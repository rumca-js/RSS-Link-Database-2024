For centuries, the Roncal Valley, in the Navarrese Pyrenees, has pleased the world's palates through the unique cheese that bears its name. The first Spanish cheese to receive Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) status, Roncal owes its signature piquant bouquet to a closely guarded production process, which has historically used the milk of an indigenous breed of sheep called the latxa. This breed, named after the Basque word for "sour," is productive enough to satisfy the artisanal needs of the local cheese-making industry.

One of the aims of the Paris Agreement was to "pursue efforts" to keep global warming below 1.5°C, but even this ambitious target would not stop the land's ability to absorb carbon weakening as wildfires become fiercer and more frequent, according to U.K. and Brazilian scientists. The climate simulations used to determine the 1.5°C Paris target lacked information about fire and vegetation, they say, so they ran simulations that included that data.
