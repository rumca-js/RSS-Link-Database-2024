On September 9, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Taiwan Conflict Deterrence Act. The bill stipulates that if Beijing is about to attack Taiwan, the U.S. Department of the Treasury must disclose the illegal assets of Chinese senior officials in accordance with the law, including members of the Politburo Standing Committee, members of the Politburo, and members of the Central Committee who perform public duties that affect Taiwan, as well as their immediate family members. It will also cut off their and their families' access to the U.S. financial system and freeze their assets.
