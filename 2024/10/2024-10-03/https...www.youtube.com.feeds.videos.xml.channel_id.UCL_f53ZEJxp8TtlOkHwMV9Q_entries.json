Peterson sits down with physicist and author, Dr. Brian Greene. They discuss the strange conceptualization of \u201cbefore\u201d the Big Bang, how time might be a microscopic phenomenon, how order existed at the point of the universe's creation, what would happen if you fell into a black hole, and the process of going from understanding to harnessing new insights.\n\nDr. Brian Greene is an American physicist known for his research on string theory. He is a professor of physics and mathematics at Columbia University and the chairman of the World Science Festival, which he co-founded in 2008. Dr. Greene has worked on mirror symmetry, relating two different Calabi\u2013Yau manifolds (concretely relating the conifold to one of its orbifolds). He also described the flop transition, a mild form of topology change, showing that topology in string theory can change at the conifold point.\n\nThis episode was recorded on September 9th, 2024\n\nUn", "id": 1263256, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPHIMXiZ7bw", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 167, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/bPHIMXiZ7bw/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "The Intersection of Science and Meaning | Dr. Brian Greene | EP 486", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-10-03T15:00:16+00:00", "description": null, "id": 1261314, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZwuT3K4lP0", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 26, "page_rating_contents": 82, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 167, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/FZwuT3K4lP0/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "You Can Overcome Your Crippling Fear", "vote": 0}]
