<p>Last year, during the run up to the release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/first-indiana-jones-and-the-dial-of-destiny-trailer-totally-whips/1100-6509648/">Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny</a>, Disney brought the first four films--Raiders of the Lost Ark, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, and Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull--to Disney+. But as of this month, Dial of Destiny is the last Indiana Jones movie streaming on Disney+.</p><p>This shouldn't be too surprising for fans of the franchise. Disney's acquisition of Lucasfilm in 2012 gave the studio full ownership of Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Willow, and all of the other intellectual properties that were created under George Lucas. However, that deal did not retroactively give Disney the rights to any of the movies produced before 2012. That's why the distribution rights for the first four Indiana Jones movies remain with Paramount. There was a similar si

But most importantly, it adds new loot.</p><p>There's plenty of that coming in Vessel of Hatred. In total, Blizzard has confirmed there are 24 new Unique items coming in the expansion, one for each base game class and 16 for the newly introduced Spiritborn. Unique items are far more powerful following Diablo 4 Season 5, and in Vessel of Hatred, they're getting even stronger.</p><p>All Ancestral items now roll with a guaranteed Greater Affix (with a chance for more) making Ancestral Uniques better than ever.

Every game is available for super cheap, and the more games you add to your bundle, the better the deal gets.

<p dir="ltr">When Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24, 2022, it threw the entire country into chaos. Missiles fell on Ukrainian cities and Russian soldiers pushed over its borders. For developers at Ukrainian developer GSC Game World, it was a harrowing time--they had to decide whether to flee the fighting and the country or stay behind to help and even to fight.</p><p dir="ltr">Documentary War Game: The Making of Stalker 2 covers the development of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl/">Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl</a> before and during the Russian invasion, bringing life to an often deeply emotional and frightening tale of what the studio's 300 employees faced. As developers worked to complete a game about which many felt deeply passionate--2008's Stalker: Shadow of Chornobyl is notable for its commercial and critical success, as well as the fact that it's a proudly Ukrainian game--they found themselves facing increasing tensions as the tensions be

<p>For the first time since 1977, dockworkers at ports from Maine to Texas are on strike for higher wages and better working conditions, prompting fears of product shortages. But will the strike, which covers 45,000+ dockworkers at 36 ports on the US East and Gulf coasts, impact video games?</p><p>The short answer: probably not, at least not in the short term. Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter tells GameSpot that nearly every major product manufactured in Asia comes into the US through ports on the West coast. Video game consoles like PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch devices are manufactured in China and are known to come into the US through ports on the West coast. As such, the impact of the strike on video game console availability may be limited.</p><p>The availability of video game consoles was constrained during the pandemic due in part to global semiconductor shortages and supply chain challenges. These issues impacted Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo, along with a n

As far back as 2011, Miyamoto said he liked to remove himself from development a little so the studio's younger developers would step up their involvement.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/shigeru-miyamot
