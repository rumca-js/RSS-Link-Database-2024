<p>In the C# programming language, extension methods enable you to extend the functionality of existing types without modifying them or deriving new types from them using inheritance. You don’t need to create subclasses of existing classes or recompile or modify your existing classes to use extension methods. Extension methods improve the readability of your code while at the same time allowing you to extend the functionality of existing classes or interfaces. Microsoft introduced extension methods in C# 3.0.</p>



<p>Common extension methods in .NET include the LINQ standard query operators that add additional query capabilities to the System.Collections.IEnumerable and System.Collections.Generic
