As someone who has evangelized for the video game industry and how games, long villainized by parents, politicians, and police, are actually either a neutral or positive force for the public and culture, I never shy away from sharing studies that demonstrate this. While a great deal of time has been spent on discussions of [&#8230;]

A year ago, we wrote about how a challenge brought by the Free Speech Coalition against Utah’s (obviously unconstitutional) age verification law couldn’t go forward because the district court noted (regrettably) that the structure of the law prevented FSC from challenging it before it went into effect. The issue is that it’s a “bounty” law, [&#8230;]

The &#8220;no-fly&#8221; list has many problems. Pretty much any fed can &#8220;nominate&#8221; someone for the list. Pretty much everyone on the list has almost zero chance of getting off it other than by filing a lawsuit. And even though the government has been forced by court decisions to offer a venue for challenges, the federal [&#8230;]

Well, things sure move fast in this world of AI regulations. Just last week, we noted that California Governor Gavin Newsom signed a pretty obviously unconstitutional set of laws regarding the use of deepfake imagery around “election communications.” Then, just hours later, he was sued for it. This week, federal judge John Mendez has already [&#8230;]

As noted a few times, recent Supreme Court rulings have thrown most U.S. regulatory enforcement into operational and legal chaos. The dismantling of Chevron in particular now dictates that regulators can&#8217;t implement new rules or reforms without the explicit approval of Congress. Two problems there: one, regulators ideally have very specific subject expertise Congress doesn&#8217;t [&#8230;]

Going all the way back to 2020, we have been discussing one of a series of copyright disputes centered on video games and their faithful depictions of real-life tattoos within them. While the first of these were related to depictions of NBA players in Take-Two&#8217;s NBA2K series, which the company generally successfully defended, one outlier [&#8230;]
