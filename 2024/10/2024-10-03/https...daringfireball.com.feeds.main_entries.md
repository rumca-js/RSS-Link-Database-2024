<p>An important follow-up to <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/10/02/russia-app-store-vpns">yesterday’s item</a> about Russia demanding Apple remove VPN apps from the Russian App Store: you can use a VPN on iOS without an app. It just requires some futzing in Settings and a VPN provider that supports it. Presumably, this technique remains available to iPhone users in Russia. Here are instructions from one such VPN provider, ForestVPN:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
<li>Access Settings:
<ul><li>Open the Settings app on your iPhone.</li>
<li>Tap on General and scroll to VPN &amp; Device Management.</li></ul></li>
<li>Add VPN Configuration:
<ul><li>Select Add VPN Configuration.</li>
<li>Choose your desired protocol, such as L2TP or IKEv2.</li></ul></li>
<li>Enter VPN Details:
<ul><li>Fill in the necessary fields like Description, Server,
Remote ID, and Local ID. These details can be found on the
ForestVPN website.</li></ul></li>
<li>Save and Connect:
<ul><li>Tap Done to save you

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://www.starlink.com/support/article/58126733-e4d2-db62-b919-9da261a4e096">Starlink announced on Oct. 2</a> it will offer one month of free
internet in Hurricane Helene disaster areas. The free service will
be available to new customers who order through the Starlink
website and to customers who activate a kit they already have,
whether it was donated or purchased at a retail store. Existing
customers may also be eligible.</p>

<p>The announcement comes after more than 500 Starlink kits were
distributed throughout the disaster area by private relief
organizations.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hurricane Helene has caused massive damage and taken over 100
lives across several US states. Many thousands of people are
without power and/or cell service. But in the wake of the storm,
reports have surfaced about a <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/06/10/dont-have-a-connection-ios-18-lets-you-send-messages-with-your-iphone-over-satellite/">key iOS 18 feature</a> that has
been a lifeline for survivors: Messages via satellite.</p>

<p>Apple added Messages via satellite to millions of iPhones via its
recent iOS 18 update. And now, according to reports on social
media, it seems the feature arrived just in time. Here are a few
tweets highlighting how useful the feature has proven.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s great that iOS 18 shipped before Helene hit, but a shame that it’s so new that most users <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/ios-version-market-share/">haven’t yet upgraded</a>. And once Helene hit and knocked out all

<blockquote>
  <p>We love getting into the nerdy details of design innovations and
the iPhone 16‘s new Camera Control button presented a perfect
opportunity to dig in. For this first podcast of our new Design
Tangents series aptly named Nerdy Details we sit down with Johnnie
Manzari from the Apple Human Interface team and Rich Dinh, Senior
Director of Product Design, to talk about cameras and photography
through the lens of the new control on “the world’s most popular
camera.”</p>

<p>You don’t often get to hear Apple employees speak about their work. When you do, it’s often largely about trying to get the <em>feel</em> right.</p>

## Apple Weather Is Delivering Spurious ‘Excessive Heat’ Warnings to Users Who Are Nowhere Near the Heat Wave

<p>Zac Hall, 9to5Mac:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>iPhone users are being <a href="https://weatherkit.apple.com/alertDetails/index.html?ids=e3f2b0d5-cefb-52c1-9609-6d82d1b89469&amp;lang=en-US&amp;timezone=America/Los_Angeles&amp;party=apple">notified about an excessive heat weather
event</a> through Apple’s Weather app on iPhone. While the
weather event is happening in the Santa Clara Valley region of
California, the alert says that the occurrence is happening in an
area nearby regardless of where you live.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hall had a good theory — that the warnings were being to delivered to people who live nowhere near Santa Clara Valley because Apple includes Cupertino as a default location for the Weather app — but in an update acknowledges that the warning notification is being received by users who don’t have any saved locations near the heat wave. (I’ve gotten the notification on multiple devices, and don’t have Cupertino saved as a Weather location.)</p>

<p>What a weird bug.<

<p>The United States Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Haotian Sun, 34, and Pengfei Xue, 34, both Chinese nationals, were
sentenced today for participating in a sophisticated scheme to
defraud Apple Inc. out of millions of dollars’ worth of iPhones.
U.S. District Court Judge Timothy J. Kelly sentenced Sun to 57
months in prison, and sentenced Xue to 54 months in prison. [...]</p>

<p>According to the government’s evidence, between May 2017 and
September 2019, Sun, Xue, and other conspirators defrauded Apple
Inc. by submitting counterfeit iPhones to Apple Inc. for repair to
get Apple to exchange them with genuine replacement iPhones. Sun
and Xue received shipments of inauthentic iPhones from Hong Kong
at UPS mailboxes throughout the D.C. metropolitan area. They then
submitted the fake iPhones, with spoofed serial numbers and/or
IMEI numbers, to Apple retail stores and Apple Authorized Service
Providers, including the Apple Store in Georgetown. Tria
