In today's Daily Fix:
Saber Interactive has announced the team is working on a triple-A RPG set in the Avatar: The Last Airbender universe. While this won't be the first ATLA game, the previous entries have been mostly shovelware that rehashed the events of the animated series. This new game promises to be the big budget title fans have been clamoring after for years. In other news, Konami had to bump the difficulty up on the upcoming Metal Gear Solid 3 remake. The new camera scheme in MGS Delta made the old style of playing apparently too easy. And finally, a mod for the PC version of God of War: Ragnarok can silence the verbal companion hints on some of the puzzles. And yes, the mod is called "Please Shut Up."

Between the hype for the arrival of Dragon Ball Sparking! Zero and Dragon Ball Daima and the outpouring of love and adoration for series creator Akira Toriyama following his passing, there’s no denying that Dragon Ball is a global phenomenon, but it wasn’t always a sure thing in the United States. Despite already being a champ in Japan, Goku’s off-screen journey to the west was a long one, so let’s take a look back at how exactly Akira Toriyama’s martial arts epic got its start (or rather, starts) and reached an English-speaking audience more than a decade after Goku and company had become household names in Japan. From the ill-fated Harmony Gold USA “lost” dub of Dragon Ball, to Funimation’s failed attempt to get Goku’s early adventures to catch on and subsequent success with DBZ once it landed on Toonami. But still, the average Dragon Ball Z viewer probably had some questions, especially if they strolled through their local toy aisle. Still, DBZ rules, and it became a hit! (Obviousl

“Next, it's your turn!” 

Those were the words All Might, Symbol of Peace, let out after defeating All For One, Symbol of Evil. All Might may no longer be the No. 1 hero of a society where most of the population has a superpowered Quirk, but Deku and his Hero Course classmates at U.A. High School are determined to carry on his will and ideals as heroes.

It was spring of Deku’s second year at U.A. when an all-out battle between heroes and villains broke out. Deku faced an overwhelmingly powerful Tomura Shigaraki and the two clashed violently, with both the heroes and the villains suffering heavy damages. The battle has since come to a temporary halt with Shigaraki’s retreat, but the time for their next confrontation draws closer with every second. 

Japan is devastated by the all-out battle when a mysterious man suddenly appears. He presents himself as the one to replace All Might, becoming the new Symbol. He proclaims “Next, it’s my turn!” but turns out to be Dark Might! Despite rese

At first glance, RetroRealms Halloween & Ash vs. Evil Dead might seem like just another typical licensed platformer, complete with nostalgic graphics, over-the-top violence, and two beloved, recognizable characters. But after playing, it became obvious to me that this was something more special, thanks to a world full of nostalgia and Easter eggs from the Halloween and Evil Dead franchises, and gameplay that is so fun and intuitive I had a hard time putting it down. In fact, I frequently found myself booting it up on my Steam Deck just so I could play it a little more.
