Government subsidies for business practices and processes should be approached with caution, even when they seem to be environmentally friendly, writes a group of scientists and economists. They argue that subsidies can alter market pressures, leading to unintended consequences that not only perpetuate harmful subsidies over time but also diminish the overall effectiveness of those intended to promote environmental sustainability.

According to a new study, colonies of ants began farming fungi when an asteroid struck Earth 66 million years ago. This asteroid impact caused a global mass extinction but also created ideal conditions for fungi to thrive. Innovative ants began cultivating the fungi, creating an evolutionary partnership that became even more tightly intertwined 27 million years ago and continues to this day.

An international team of researchers have made a promising breakthrough in the development of drugs to treat Alzheimer's Disease. For the first time, scientists have developed a drug that works on both major aggregation-promoting 'hotspots' of the Tau protein in the brain -- a key driver of neurodegeneration. The drug, a peptide inhibitor called RI-AG03, was effective at preventing the build-up of Tau proteins in both lab and fruit fly studies.

Plants like Arabidopsis rely on a molecule called DDM1 to pass down accurate chromosome copies to future generations. But if it's so important, why isn't Arabidopsis affected when DDM1 is lost? After 30 years, botanists have found the answer. Arabidopsis has a backup plan known as RNAi.

Overweight is a major contributor to complications during pregnancy and childbirth -- this applies to both women born in Sweden and women who have moved here, something that has not been well researched so far. Interventions that promote a healthy weight have the potential to prevent complications for all women, the researchers conclude. The study was conducted by researchers at Link ping University and Karolinska Institutet and is published in The Lancet Public Health.

Increasingly complex applications such as artificial intelligence require ever more powerful and power-hungry computers to run. Optical computing is a proposed solution to increase speed and power efficiency but has yet to be realized due to constraints and drawbacks. A new design architecture, called diffraction casting, seeks to address these shortcomings. It introduces some concepts to the field of optical computing that might make it more appealing for implementation in next-generation computing devices.
