<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello,</p> <p>Did the 2nd edition fix the board warping? I&#39;m getting it brand new From Facebook Marketplace and he confirmed it&#39;s the 2nd edition.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Been really interested in this game since I came across it a year ago but now it is back in stock. Clearly people like it enough to warrant an edition with some expansions added but does the game hold up nowadays or are there games which have come out that do what it does/ does something similar better?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Blitzkreeg21"> /u/Blitzkreeg21 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1fuywwf/is_mystic_vale_essential_edition_still_worth/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1fuywwf/is_mystic_vale_essential_edition_still_worth/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello everyone!<br/> I teach a history class and I want good manipulables. I love how videos such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCx-dJoP9hFCBloY9qodykvw">Baz Battles</a> uses little block counters to represent the various army units.<br/> I want to use this for demonstration in my classes. Is there a good game that comes with a lot of these wooden block pieces? Even better if it is also a fun game :D<br/> Thank you! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/-Inshal"> /u/-Inshal </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1fux7ja/wargames_for_the_classroom/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1fux7ja/wargames_for_the_classroom/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Bought big boss on crazy sale on woot recently (8$!) and played it tonight for the first time. Really enjoyed it. Easy to play but a deeper than expected strategy for a lighter weight game. My only gripe was it did take a long time to play with 4 people (first playthrough was 2 1/2 hours). Any house rules out there or thoughts about the game in general?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/hyrulianpokemaster"> /u/hyrulianpokemaster </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1fux33k/big_boss_thoughts_and_advice/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1fux33k/big_boss_thoughts_and_advice/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have been watching Essen Previews and it looks like there are a ton of mid-heavy euros coming out that content creators are super excited about (civolution, seti, minos, galileo, phoenix, shacklton base, galactic cruise, daitoshi, unconsious mind, saltford, black forest, mennefer, refasa, beyond the horizon, etc). The problem is that I only would like 1 (max 2) new games, so how do I decide which ones to get? All of the games I listed are beeing raved about by content creators (Radho, MvM, GamingRules, etc).</p> <p>However, I am getting sick of the flood of similar euro games. I played evacuation, woodcraft, kutna hora, barcelona, marakkesh, etc all of which were good games, but after 1 game I didn&#39;t feel a strong need to play them again. </p> <p>How do you sort through the sea of upcoming games and find what is right for you? I love engine building mid-heavy euros like Underwater Cities, Revive, Tapestry, Maracaibo and Voidfall, but all the oth
