Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the media has done a lot of "fact-checking" during this election, and especially during the debates. Unfortunately, every single fact check has been wrong. Also, Kamala Harris takes the side of the dockworker union that's threatening to cripple the economy. A lib journalist gets horribly offended when a flight attendant tells her to have a blessed day. And Jussie Smollett emerges from hiding to explain to the world why he's still a victim.
