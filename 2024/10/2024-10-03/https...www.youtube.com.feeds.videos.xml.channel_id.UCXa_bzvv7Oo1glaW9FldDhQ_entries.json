With its launch around the corner, here, we\u2019re going to go over a few key details that you should know about it.", "id": 1260524, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJ3gq9xN2I0", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 129, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/oJ3gq9xN2I0/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Unknown 9: Awakening - 10 Things You NEED To Know Before You Buy", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-10-03T13:30:08+00:00", "description": "FromSoftware's input with Dark Souls aside, Souls-likes have come and gone through the years, each putting a unique spin on brutally difficult exploration, combat and boss fights. We've also seen a fair number of Sekiro-likes, catering to a different skill set but still requiring patience. However, few titles have attempted to reconcile the two.\n\nThis leads us to Nexon's The First Berserker: Khazan. It sees the disgraced General Khazan on a mission for revenge. It stands out among the competition, mixing Souls-like exploration and mechanics with Sekiro-like parrying alongside a dash of Nioh, a loot system, and a gorgeous anime art style.\n\nAfter going hands-on with the recent closed beta, The First Berserker: Khazan has immediately become a hack-and-slash title worth looking forward to before its launch next year. Even in this stage, it's an unforgiving yet exhilarating experience.\n\nThis is based on Closed Beta.", "id": 1260525, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xwA5_HRUqM", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 129, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/7xwA5_HRUqM/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "The First Berserker Khazan Is A Top Tier Mix of Dark Souls And Sekiro", "vote": 0}]
