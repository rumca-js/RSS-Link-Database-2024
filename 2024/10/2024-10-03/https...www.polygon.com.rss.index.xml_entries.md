There’s something intrinsically rewarding about capturing how a game went from box to setup and then from setup to a full game — to capture how busy and frenetic everything got, as seen through token-laden boards and stacks of cards in various states of disarray. It’s not that we’ve built anything permanent or long-term impactful, but I love to take time to capture a memory of that experience nonetheless.</p>
