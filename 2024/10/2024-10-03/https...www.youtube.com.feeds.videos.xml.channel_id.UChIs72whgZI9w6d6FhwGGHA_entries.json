This time, the company's SilverStone 514X and 515XR are coming to market. The 515XR is an Asia-market case that SilverStone is considering bringing to Western markets. The primary reason for the difference comes down to the fans, where the 'rainbow fan' style (not standard RGB) is apparently popular in other markets, but also the dimensions. The 515XR is a little more stout. The 514X is shipping to the global market though, and that one is priced as a $100 4-fan case. It's a tough spot to compete in right now -- we'll be publishing a Lancool 207 review soon as well.\n\nThe best way to support our work is through our store: https://store.gamersnexus.net/\n\nLike our content?
