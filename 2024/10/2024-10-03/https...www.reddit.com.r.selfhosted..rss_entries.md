But there are situations where <strong>I might require to take my hard disk for the go</strong>. My daily driver is a <strong>Windows machine</strong> which <strong>does not read ext4</strong> file system (or I might be wrong, but I couldn&#39;t find a solution as much as I have seen). Which file system should I chose that is stable and <em>will help me to use the hard disk in both Windows and Linux</em>?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Immediate_Ad9718"> /u/Immediate_Ad9718 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1fuw6r7/confusion_in_file_system/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1fuw6r7/confusion_in_file_system/">[comments]</a></span>
