<p>OpenAI is beta testing a new workspace interface for ChatGPT called Canvas. The AI giant unveiled its new ChatGPT workspace on <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-canvas/"><ins>its official blog</ins></a> and it’s currently available for ChatGPT Plus and Team users. Enterprise and Edu users will be able to access Canvas sometime next week.</p>
<p>Canvas is a virtual interface space for writing and coding projects that allow users to consult with ChatGPT on certain portions of a project. A separate window opens besides the main chat space and users can put writing or code on this new “canvas” and highlight sections to have the model focus on and edit “like a copy editor or code reviewer,” according to the blog.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Canvas can either be opened manually by typing “use canvas” in your prompt. Canvas can also automatically open when it “detects a scenario in which it could be helpful,” according to the blog post

There are always a couple of deals available for everyone, though, so it’s worth perusing Amazon’s site even if you don’t pay for Prime. It’s also worth doing so now because we’ve found a number of solid early Prime Day deals already available.

<p>Google is adding more AI to search. On Thursday, the company unveiled a long list of changes, including AI-organized web results, Google Lens updates (including video and voice) and placing links and ads inside <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/google-is-putting-more-restrictions-on-ai-overviews-after-it-told-people-to-put-glue-on-pizza-011316780.html">AI Overviews</a>.</p>
<p>One can suspect that AI-organized search results are where Google will eventually move across the board, but the rollout starts with a narrow scope. Beginning with recipes and meal inspiration, Google’s AI will create a “full-page experience” that includes relevant results based on your search. The company says the AI-collated pages will consist of “perspectives from across the web,” like articles, videos and forums.</p>

Concept2’s ergometers — which is the fancy word for “rowing machine” — are a mainstay of gyms all around the world. But the Vermont-based company has dragged its feet when it comes to embracing the smart fitness revolution. The best it offers is some clips on its latest machine that can be used to hold a third-party tablet in place.</p>

<p>The feature complements Spotify’s existing offline mode for user-triggered downloads. In contrast, the Offline Backup playlist doesn’t require any manual downloads. So, think of it as more preparation with less planning. (And, of course, the standard offline mode will still be there.)</p>

Oura says Ring 4 has 18 signal pathways, up from eight in the Gen3, which is paired with its new Smart Sensing algorithm.</p>
