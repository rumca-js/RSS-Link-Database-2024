<p>Online backup is an essential hedge against physical data disaster. No matter if it’s a technical failure, an act of malice, or an act of nature, you never know when all the files and folders you have stored on your PC will be threatened.</p>



<p>While we always recommend keeping a local backup for quick restores (see our roundup of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407021/best-windows-backup-software.html" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407021/best-windows-backup-software.html">best Windows backup software</a> for desktop solutions), uploading your data to an online backup service can be a reliable way to cover your bases.

<p>If you’re running a PCIe Gen 5 solid-state drive, odds are pretty good that you care a lot about speed. After all, you paid a big premium to get one of the fastest SSDs available right now, and probably a good bit extra for a motherboard that could take advantage of it.</p>



<p>But some PC owners with AMD X670E motherboards say they’re seeing abysmal read and write speeds with those fancy Gen 5 drives.</p>



<p>According to forum posts by owners of MSI and Asus motherboards using the X670E chipset (that’s the newest model compatible with AM5-socket Ryzen processors), at least some of these mobos are chopping Gen 5 drives all the way down to PCIe Gen 1 speeds.</p>



<p>In other words, a drive that should be reading at 10GB/s or faster is being hobbled down to just 1GB/s on an x4 lane. While the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2254813/why-pc-gam

<p>Last week, the World Wide Web Foundation <a href="https://webfoundation.org/docs/2024/09/Public_letter_WWWF.pdf">announced in an open letter</a> (PDF) that it would be “winding down” and “closing [its] virtual doors” after 15 years of working to make the web safer and more accessible.</p>



<p>The World Wide Web Foundation was founded in 2009 by Tim Berners-Lee, the man who’s widely credited as inventing the world wide web and making it possible for regular users like you and me to browse websites and download files over the internet.</p>



<p>When the WWWF was first created, only 20 percent of the world’s population had access to the internet. Today, that figure has ballooned to an astonishing 70 percent with no signs of stopping — and alongside that growth, ever more threats of scams, malware, and hackers.</p>

<p>We love our laptops, but it’d be great if they had more ports. In the process of slimming down modern laptops, they’ve also lost a lot of their connectivity — but you can get ’em back with a good docking station.</p>



<p>And right now, one of our favorite docks is on sale: the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Belkin-Thunderbolt-Transfer-Upstream-Charging/dp/B08438H4GM/">Belkin Thunderbolt 3 Dock Core is down to just $68.92 on Amazon</a>, a jaw-dropping 66% drop from its usual $200 MSRP.</p>



<p>This particular model uses Thunderbolt 3 technology for fast and reliable connections between your laptop and all your peripherals. And it has <em>plenty</em> of connectivity options: a DisplayPort 1.4 port, an HDMI 2.0 port, a USB-C PD port, a USB-A 3.2 Gen 2 port, a USB-A 2.0 port, and a Gigabit Ethernet port, and a headphone/microphone jack. All of this is eno

<p>The Linux desktop offers versatile possibilities for optimizing window management, making it an effective tool for multitasking. With window lists, tiling methods, virtual desktops, and active corners, Linux desktops have more to offer than the interfaces of other operating systems.</p>

<p>All Linux desktops obey the <strong>Alt-Tab</strong> hotkey for task switching, but generally only offer the tasks of the current desktop. There are exceptions, such as LXQT (Lubuntu), which offer all windows. </p>



<p>However, most desktops have a setting to extend the range to all panes, such as XFCE via <em>Settings > Window management fine-tuning</em> (“Window cycle through all panes”).</p>

<p>OLED displays have been one of the hottest new things in laptops these past few years, and they’re just as desirable in desktop monitors, too. And why wouldn’t they be? <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2330170/are-oled-laptops-worth-the-extra-price.html">OLED screens have some big advantages</a>, like vivid image quality and better contrast.</p>



<p>So, maybe you bought one and maybe you’re reading this article on an OLED display. Maybe you <em>are</em> impressed by OLED image quality and you have zero regrets having shelled out all that cash for it.</p>



<p>But there’s one thing you might not have considered when it comes to optimizing the OLED experience: <strong>you have to embrace dark mode</strong>.</p>

<p>Quantum computers are the future, and a near-term future at that. They will be exponentially more powerful than the computers we have today and will allow us to make huge potential leaps forward in fields such as curing diseases and artificial intelligence. They can also be used to easily crack today’s passwords, hack into secure networks, and quickly harvest mass amounts of data.</p>



<p>Due to these risks, VPN providers such as <a href="https://nordvpn.com/">NordVPN</a> are trying to stay ahead of the game with post-quantum encryption. NordVPN, one of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/406870/best-vpn-services-apps-reviews-buying-advice.html">best VPNs</a> on the market, and a company continually on the bleeding-edge of privacy and security features, has just released its first-ever app with post-quantum encryption support. </p>
