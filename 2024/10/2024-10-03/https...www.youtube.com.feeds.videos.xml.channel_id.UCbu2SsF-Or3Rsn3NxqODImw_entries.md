Tobias Capwell is an independent scholar, curator, an expert on arms and armor, as well as a historical advisor for movies and TV. 

Today he’s breaking down some of the weapons, armour and inspirations found within the campaign of Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2.

From the arsenal of Titus and the Ultramarines, to the warp-touched weaponry of the heretical Thousand Sons we dive into the lore of 40k, Warhammer's historical influences, and how a chainsword may perform against futuristic ceramite armor.
