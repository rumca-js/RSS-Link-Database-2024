Running toilets are expensive, replacing the flapper is normally the solution. I used the @fluidmaster_inc Super Flapper because it can replace 2-inch and 3-inch flappers. It attaches to the tabs on the flush valve and the blue knob adjusts the water volume being flushed. Itâ€™s easy to install and quick solution
