I originally bought some cheap craft acrylic and was just having fun with the process, but I kept getting upset with the finished product. I was using a picture as a guide, and even asked the community on how to paint a specific way to get my desired results, but even though I did everything correct, my finished product was bumpy and weird. This was upsetting to me, because even though I tried as hard as I could, I just couldn&#39;t figure out what was causing the issue. I had thinned my paints as well as I could, watched guides on how to paint, everything.
