I used raspi-config to set composite to the display setting, and rebooted. Now, it only shows gray, nothing else, not even the splash screen. my manual additions were the <code>enable_tvout=1</code> and appending composite to the end of the <code>dtoverlay=vc4-kms-v3d,composite</code> as suggested in the rptl documentation.
