<p>Gary O’Neil finds himself in a tight spot, Jadon Sancho helps lead Chelsea revival and Leicester need to get on front foot</p><p>Liverpool have not lost at Selhurst Park since November 2014 when Dwight Gayle opened the scoring in a 3-1 win for a side then managed by Neil Warnock. But having seen their title challenge waver last season after losing at Anfield in April to a goal from Eberechi Eze, Arne Slot will be wary of facing a Crystal Palace team that has yet to record a victory in the Premier League this season. Fresh from his brilliant goal against Bologna in the Champions League, Mohamed Salah will be licking his lips at the prospect of facing a new-look Palace defence that has not looked convincing this season despite a 0-0 draw against Manchester United in their last home match. The Egyptian scored his 200th Liverpool goal against them in December to take his tally to eight in just 11 appearances, not to mention seven assists. <strong>Ed Aarons</strong></p><p><em>Crystal Pa

<p></p><p>The darkest point is supposedly always before dawn. Did Harry Maguire’s late equaliser cast Manchester United’s 3-0 loss against Tottenham as this? Because beforehand, Erik ten Hag was leading his men into an ever bleaker pitch-blackness. From 2-0 up to 2-2 in seven first-half minutes, to allowing a third that seemed to kill off United, then to Bruno Fernandes’s second red card in two matches. This seemed to have Ten Hag’s tenure heading for oblivion.</p><p>It may still do: the Dutch manager likes to quip he is no Harry Potter. The escape here with a draw has him, for tonight, as Harry Houdini.

<p>Axing the cap is the first step towards pulling children out of poverty. Could £2.5bn ever be better spent?</p><p>At a stroke, this government could wipe out much of the extra child poverty caused by the last government. It would be a bargain, at a cost of just £2.5bn, revealed today in the Institute for Fiscal Studies’ <a href="https://ifs.org.uk/sites/default/files/2024-10/Child-poverty-trends-and-policy-options_1.pdf">assessment for the next budget</a>. Authors Anna Henry and Tom Wernham have found the two-child benefit cap added significantly to the rising numbers of children thrown into poverty since 2010. Their findings make it all the more inconceivable that Labour would not scrap the two-child limit at this month’s budget. Nothing else it could spend on would have such instant effect and long-term value.

<p>The shape, color and texture of your tongue can offer valuable insights into your wellbeing, experts say</p><p>Once, at a party, a woman said she could tell everything she needed to know about my friend by looking at her tongue. My friend dutifully opened her mouth, and after a few moments of careful examination, the woman declared that my friend needed to take control of her life.</p><p>Arguably a more impressive trick would have been to find someone who wouldn’t consider this good advice. But the idea that our tongues hold clues to our wellbeing spans millennia and continents, explains Dr Yanfang Ren, professor at the University of Rochester’s Eastman Institute for Oral Health. In traditional Chinese medicine, for example, different sections of the tongue are associated with different organs.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2024/oct/03/tongue-color-normal-health">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This RPG is the third massively multiplayer online game Amazon has published in four years, and lets you morph your heroes into animals. Is it worth a shot?</p><p>Amazon has been trying to break into the games industry for years, yet despite using the vast resources at its disposal to hire some of the best designers in the business, the company struggled for years to make headway. Lately, however, Amazon has found success publishing massively multiplayer online games. First came 2021’s New World, Amazon Games’ homebrew fantasy with an emphasis on survival and player-built settlements. The following year brought Lost Ark, developed by Korean studio SmileGate, which combined large-scale multiplayer with Diablo-style fighting. Critical reception was mixed, but both games proved popular with players. This week, Amazon publishes its third MMO in four years, Throne and Liberty, also developed in Korea. Here’s everything you need to know about this latest free offering.</p><p><strong>What

Just as in 1982’s European Cup final, Villa beat Bayern 1-0. The goal came from a player who (sort of) shares his surname with Birmingham’s most famous pop group.

Remember how your first instinct upon hearing the news was “Wow, television must really be in a bad place if someone is actually considering an international remake of a 23-year-old sitcom that already exists in two definitive forms”?</p><p>Well, I’m sorry to inform you that you were premature. It might be foolish to remake The Office, but it isn’t stupid. No, what would be stupid were if a British production company was to pitch a remake of Cheers. That would essentially be an outright admission of defeat from the entire television industry as a whole.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.c

Emily was bright-eyed, American and gratingly chirpy; Sylvie was cool, French and had cigarettes for lunch. Emily dressed in vivid colours and clashing prints and wore berets and bucket hats; Sylvie’s wardrobe was all sleek black tailoring – and she would probably rather die than wear anything resembling a bucket.</p><p>Sylvie (Philippine Leroy-Beaulieu) duly filled the role of the show’s antagonist: opposed to Emily’s very presence in Paris, she challenged her at every turn.

<p>New leader of England’s Test attack is ready for the challenge of Pakistan after show of faith from Brendon McCullum and Ben Stokes</p><p>“It was after the Oval Test and Baz came over and said: ‘You’re in. You’ve had a great summer in terms of stepping up to lead the attack and I want your experience. I feel you can have a really positive impact on the other players, on and off the field. I can’t guarantee selection but we want you to fulfil that role for us this winter.’”</p><p>With that, Chris Woakes was folding up his England whites and popping them in the suitcase for the first time in two and a half years. Destination? Multan, for the three-Test series against Pakistan that begins on Monday. The mission? A series win, naturally.

Pamela was then on marriage number two, her first being a wartime mistake to Randolph Churchill. She exited it with a child, Winston, whom she neglected, and a famous last name that she protected fiercely. Her American do-over was Leland Hayward, the Broadway producer of such hits as South Pacific and The Sound of Music.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/boo

Are broadcasters pushing staff too far?</p><p>As a young female TV crew member working in an industry where 50% of freelancers are currently unemployed, Amelie* was desperate for a job and money to pay her bills. So when she was offered work on a TV film for a major UK broadcaster miles from where she lived, she took it – despite the fact no accommodation was provided. The set location was in Essex, two and a half to three hours’ drive away from home. Her commute entailed driving around the M25 to and from each day’s shooting, which could take six hours a day during rush hour, and doing the journey even when filming finished at 5.30am. So it was no surprise to those who knew her that, after a couple of weeks, she fell asleep at the wheel of her car and crashed.</p><p>It also came as no shock to many who work within the multibillion-pound UK television industry.

<p>Sim is superbly insinuating as the detective arriving with a few questions for the complacent residents of a grand Edwardian home</p><p>JB Priestley’s drawing-room melodrama of Edwardian guilt and fear is rereleased for its 70th anniversary; it is an intricate clockwork mechanism ticking inexorably to the final reveal, with beautiful monochrome cinematography and thoroughbred character-actor faces looming out of the screen like a bad dream. It was adapted by Desmond Davis from Priestley’s stage play, directed by Guy Hamilton and unforgettably stars Alastair Sim as the implacable Inspector Poole, with his cool professional insolence, a needling, insinuating manner and sonorously droll voice; it is a performance to put alongside Sim’s Scrooge and his Professor Potter in School for Scoundrels.</p><p>It is 1912, and the inspector arrives unexpectedly at the sumptuous home of well-to-do magistrate and captain of industry Arthur Birling (Arthur Young), who is hosting a dinner party to ce

<p>From Orkney to Brighton, independent stores are treasure troves for vinyl hunters and a great way to while away a holiday afternoon</p><p>I still remember the excitement of buying my first vinyl aged 11, Duane Eddy’s great 1962 single (Dance With the) Guitar Man, and that bug has been with me ever since. There’s nothing quite like the thrill of digging through the racks and finding that elusive wishlist record. When I retired, I made it my mission to visit as many record shops as I could across the globe, from Amsterdam to Warsaw, via Berlin, Budapest, Madrid, Paris, Stockholm and Vienna and even as far as Australia and New Zealand. But lately my focus has been on visiting every record shop across the UK – and to buy something at every stop.</p><p>Established shops close and new ones open on a regular basis and, according to the Entertainment Retailers Association (ERA), the number of independent record stores in the UK has reached a 10-year high.

What we know on day 953</p><ul><li><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia+ukraine">See all our Russia-Ukraine war coverage</a></strong></li></ul><p><strong>A Russian guided bomb struck a five-storey apartment block in Kharkiv late on Wednesday, starting fires and injuring at least 10 people</strong>, local officials said. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said the strike underscored the need for more help from Ukraine’s western backers. He pointed to Iran’s strike on Israel as an example of allies working together to shoot down incoming rockets and missiles. “Ukraine must receive the necessary, and most importantly, sufficient help from the world, from our partners … Every time in the Middle East, during criminal Iranian strikes, we see how the international coalition acts together.”</p>
