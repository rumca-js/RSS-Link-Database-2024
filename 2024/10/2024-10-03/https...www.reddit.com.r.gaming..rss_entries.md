Using such big numbers, there’s no point. I’m not gonna get any meaningful gauge on my damage if they’re only on the screen for a second and they are 1,248,388 vs 1,253,940.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So obviously this is just speculation BUT here we go.</p> <p>The Paramount Accords, also known as the Paramount Decrees, were a series of rulings in the 1940s and 1950s that prevented film production companies in the United States from owning exhibition companies, a practice known as vertical integration. This was a landmark decision in antitrust law, and it effectively ended the old Hollywood studio system. The decrees were formally terminated in 2020 during covid, and now, production companies are able to massively inflate costs. If the movie costs more to make, they make less money, which in turn means less profit, and less money they have to give to the tax man, actors, writers... essencially everyone but themselves.</p> <p>Im thinking that unless some antitrust laws were put in place in the last 30 years to prevent this from happening in THIS industry, the same behavior would exist here. I highly doubt those laws were put in place.</p> <p>TLDR; T

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So my older brother whos in his 40s recently expressed some interest in getting into gaming again after like 20 years of not playing. He really only wants to play co-op games together but I haven&#39;t played these types of games in a long time. I mainly play PvP shooter games.</p> <p>He&#39;s looking to play strictly PvE games and has no desire to play competitive stuff.</p> <p>So my question is what would you recommend? I think Helldivers 2 is going to be a safe bet, CoD campaign stuff etc.. I can&#39;t really think of anything else that offers a robust PvE mode in the shooter genre. Help me out!</p> <p>Edit: I wanted to add we are both on PlayStation and will be playing online together as we live in different states so couch co-op isnt a necessity here. Also I just remembered Ghost Recon: Breakpoint/Wildlands are probably both going to something hes interested in as well. </p> <p>Thanks.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="ht

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Everybody looks fondly back on Rainbow Six Vegas, but at the time I personally felt like it was a huge step down from 3 and with the third person stuff, basically felt like a different series altogether. 3 was a perfect blend of tactical and casual and had some nail-biting multiplayer. I apologize if I’m reposting something y’all see a lot, but I never hear anyone give Rainbow Six 3 any love, or even any mention whatsoever. There are aspects of that game that still look better than Siege did when it was released. Do yourselves a favor and check it out sometime, it’s great.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/paperchampionpicture"> /u/paperchampionpicture </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1fuv3rl/rainbow_six_3_was_peak_rainbow_six/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1fuv3rl/rainbow_six_3_was_peak_rainbow_six/">[comments]</a>
