I colorized with a new technique, restored and created a sound design for this video of Brussels in la Belle Epoque. It shows daily life in the metropolis as it was in the streets (notably boulevard Anspach, rue de la Loi, boulevard Emile Jacqmain), parks (Parc de Bruxelles and Parc du Cinquantenaire) and markets (notably the Grand Place). Emblematic buildings such as the Stock Exchange, Palais de Justice, Saint-Michel and Saint-Gudule cathedrals, Brussels City Hall and Parliament are also very much in evidence. Then take the streetcar through the Forêt de Soignes to the Congo Museum in Tervuren.

Video Restoration Process:
✔ FPS boosted to 60 frames per second 
✔ Image resolution boosted up to HD 
✔ Improved video sharpness and brightness
