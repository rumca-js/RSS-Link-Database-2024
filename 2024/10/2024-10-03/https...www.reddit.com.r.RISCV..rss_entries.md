It is neat that a few versions of the NanoKVM-PCIe can be powered using PoE (Power over Ethernet), so you could cold boot a PC.</p> <p>ref: <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/desktops/servers/kvm-expansion-card-utilizes-risc-v-cpu-architecture-for-enhanced-remote-pc-management-sipeed-nanokvm-pcie-now-available-for-pre-order-starting-at-dollar40">https://www.tomshardware.com/desktops/servers/kvm-expansion-card-utilizes-risc-v-cpu-architec
