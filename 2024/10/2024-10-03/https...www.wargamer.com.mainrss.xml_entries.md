								<p>The first new operation for <strong>Warhammer 40k: Space Marine 2</strong>’s co-op multiplayer mode will task players with a desperate mission to try and starve the Tyranid hive fleet in orbit. As dedicated Warhammer 40k lore nuts, we thought we’d explain why that’s so cool, so scary, and why we have high hopes for a truly awesome mission.</p>

								<p>The Coldsnap <strong>Magic: The Gathering</strong> card Sunscour has started to rise in price, jumping from $1.50 on September 21 to $5.50 today. This seven mana board wipe has one main benefit - you can play it for free if you exile two white cards from your hand. It’s therefore started to see play as a sideboard card in Modern, a format whose fans just cannot get enough of free spells.</p>
