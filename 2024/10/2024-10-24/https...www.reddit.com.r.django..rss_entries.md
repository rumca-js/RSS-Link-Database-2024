<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>The goal of this project is to give AI developers doing all these advanced RAG techniques a way to author shareable and production ready code instantly by removing a lot of the HTTP layer semantics. This will help bridge the gap between Application devs and the exploding complexity in production ready AI apps. </p> <p>I chose Django because it&#39;s so dang robust and extensible. I can see a future where authors can install django apps that really compliment perfectly into their AI workflow.</p> <p>Some neat Django features </p> <p>* Django async with gunicorn + uvicorn<br/> * Django ninja for dynamic routes<br/> * Django q2 for background workers</p> <p>* S6 overlay for running the qclusters and server in the same container </p> <p>* Tailwind + htmx + daisyui</p> <p>I didn&#39;t start from scratch so I def want to acknowledge the author of Falco and using <a href="https://github.com/falcopackages/falco">https://github.com/falcopackages/falco</a> as

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone</p> <p>We are currently developing an application that is separated into modules. One of the modules will contain sensitive business information of our customers, which is why we want to offer the possibility of a separate DB.</p> <p>Ideally we would like to keep a single shared DB for all customers, except for those who have chosen a separate DB.</p> <p>We use DRF and donâ€™t intend on having a customer with its own DB also have its own subdomain, we want everything on the app subdomain. So I am thinking that all user models will have to be centrally stored so a middleware can figure out if it needs to route to a different database or something.</p> <p>So do any of you have advice on this, or can point to som resources about how you best set this flexible tenant architecture up in Django?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Electrical-Bench6733"> /u/Electrical-Bench6733 </a> <br/> <span><a

Read operations will occur at least 100 times than write operations. Now I am struggling to choose among django-hvad, django-parler-rest, django-modeltrans and django-modeltranslation. I haven&#39;t worked with any of these before, only skimmed through their documentation a little bit. So, feel free to suggest any other library that you would like me to check out.

The annoying thing is that every 20 seconds in Papertrail, the celery worker logs </p> <p><code>Oct 24 09:25:08 kinecta-eu heroku/worker.1 Process running mem=541M(105.1%)</code></p> <p><code>Oct 24 09:25:08 kinecta-eu heroku/worker.1 Error R14 (Memory quota exceeded)</code></p> <p>Now, my web dyno only uses 280MB, and I can scale that down to 110MB if I reduce concurrency from 3 to 1; this does not affect the error the worker gives. My entire database is only 17MB. The task my Celery worker has to run is a simple &#39;look at all Objects (about 100), and calculate how long ago they were created&#39;. </p> <p>Why does Celery feel it needs 500MB to do so? Ho
