With AMD's Ryzen processors going from strength to strength and thermal degradation issues dogging Intel's last desktop CPUs, Team Blue has unveiled a new tile-based architecture for both mobile CPUs (Lunar Lake) and desktop CPUs (Arrow Lake S). Lunar Lake arrived to generally positive reviews, with excellent power efficiency, AI hardware support and reasonable performance, so can the new Core Ultra 200S desktop chips pull off the same trick? </p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-intel-core-ultra-9-285k-ultra-5-245k-review">Read more</a></p>

## Like a Dragon: Yakuza season 1 review - an emotional, skull-cracking saga with no time for messing around

No need to build clanking mech armour or deploy CGI sleight-of-hand to convincingly remove your leading man's nose. The Yakuza brand started out as a contemporary street-level Tokyo crime saga, albeit one capable of reaching operatic heights of melodrama. Thanks to an obsessive amount of architectural and anthropological detail, its fictional setting of Kamurocho has always felt palpably real, from the iconic red gate on Tenkaichi Street to the tight, cluttered warren of the Champion District.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/like-a-dragon-yakuza-season-1-review">Read more</a></p>

## Batman Arkham Shadow review - a masterclass in immersion that makes you feel like a part of Gotham

<img src="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/batman-arkham-shadow.webp?width=1920&height=1920&fit=bounds&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp" /> <p>There's a moment a couple of hours into Batman Arkham Shadow when the prologue ends abruptly and the main game kicks off. It's here where the experience turns from what seems like a traditional, straight forward and fairly linear Batman game in the style of Rocksteady's Arkham series into something else entirely. It took me a little while to put my finger on it, but as I wandered freely around the interior of Blackgate penitentiary, listening to prisoners' conversations as I tried to find some contraband to bribe a guard with, it clicked. This is a Batman Arkham game in every possible way, but it oozes some absolutely delicious Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay vibes, too.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/batman-arkham-shadow-review">Read more</a></p>

Roblox Corporation has announced changes to its child-safety policies that'll impact the way pre-teen users can interact with its popular gaming platform. The move follows persitent accusations the company routinely fails to protect its predominantly young player base, and, more recently, a damning report calling Roblox an "X-rated paedophile hellscape" that exposes children to "grooming, pornography, violent content and extremely abusive speech".
