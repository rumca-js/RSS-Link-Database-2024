<p>It just had to be about him. Almost six years after being sacked by Manchester United, José Mourinho was shown a red card against his former employers for protesting when he thought his Fenerbahce side should have been awarded a penalty. But he still saw them rescue a point thanks an equaliser from Youssef En-Nesyri after they had fallen behind to Christian Eriksen’s opener.</p><p>The result – a third straight draw in this competition – leaves Erik ten Hag’s side sandwiched between Viktoria Pilzen and Elfsborg in the playoff positions of the Europa League on a night when the Dutchman had strangely decided to play Noussair Mazraoui in an unusual attacking role. The United manager will point to a vastly improved performance from a team who had conceded 17 goals in their last five away matches in Europe, although it could have been worse had Mourinho’s pleas not been ignored. Having lost 3-0 here under Sir Alex Ferguson back in 2004, at least United emerged relatively unscathed this

<p>This was a long way from Tottenham’s most cohesive performance of the season but perhaps Ange Postecoglou can file away this narrow win over AZ Alkmaar as one of those nights when the result mattered most.</p><p>There were chances for AZ at various stages, only for poor finishing to let the Dutch side down, and it is likely that Postecoglou will not have liked some of what he watched from Spurs. Some of the understudies did not do themselves justice, not least Timo Werner, and a draw would not have flattered the visitors. Even so, Spurs still did enough to maintain their perfect record in the Europa League and it was positive to see Richarlison, with a penalty early in the second half, move them closer towards securing a place in the knockout phase by scoring for the first time since May.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/24/tottenham-az-alkmaar-europa-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Britain’s greatest shot putter who twice won the World’s Strongest Man competition</p><p>Standing close to 6ft 6in and weighing more than 26st in his athletic prime, Geoff Capes was a mighty figure who commanded international respect as a record-breaking shot putter, and later achieved even greater renown as a sporting personality through appearances in televised strongman competitions. Twice he won the accolade of being World’s Strongest Man, as well as achieving serial successes in Highland Games events.</p><p>Although Capes, who has died aged 75, never fulfilled his ambition of winning an Olympic medal, despite competing in three Games, with a best finish of fifth in 1980, he had an illustrious career, winning a Commonwealth gold medal in 1974 and 1978, and twice claiming the European indoor title, in 1974 and 1976. He would represent his country on a record 67 occasions between 1969 and his retirement from athletics 11 years later, when he chose to concentrate on paid competit

The director and cinematographer have loved this greasy-spoon joint for years. It’s an ungentrified throwback, a slice of old London, serving big mugs of coffee and double helpings of spuds. Arnold points at the menu. “Look at this, mash <em>and</em> chips. That’s my idea of heaven.”</p><p>The pair first worked together more than two decades ago, when Arnold was making her Oscar-winning short, Wasp. The film’s opening shot required Ryan to run backwards down a steep flight of stairs while keeping the lead actor in frame. Most camera operators would have balked at the task, but he relished it – and they’ve been working that way ever since. He scrolls for a photo from the set of 2011’s Wuthering Heights.

<p><strong>Southwark Playhouse Elephant, London</strong> <br>A 15-year-old’s bereavement is tackled with ‘can-do’ American energy, a tremendous score and wickedly barbed lyrics that keep the schmaltz in check</p><p>This musical begins as a sunny coming-of-age story, with a teenager and aspiring novelist excitedly driving off to “writing camp”. That journey quickly veers into dark matter, from cancer diagnosis in the family to the aftermath of parental death.</p><p>Its central character, the sweet 15-year-old Malia (Robyn Rose-Li), swings between a “can-do” attitude to overcoming grief and submitting to its anguish. So does the show itself: there is a pastel wash to the set and costumes, and heavy doses of all-American schmaltz in Eric Holmes’s book and lyrics, which would grate were it not for the characters’ lovability – and the show’s sensational songs.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2024/oct/24/fly-more-than-you-fall-review-southwark-playhouse">Continue reading...<

Officially Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, will unveil Labour’s first budget (and probably most important for the whole parliament) on Wednesday next week. But in practice budget announcements are now two-week news events, because the Treasury knows that it is bad idea to spook the markets with lots of surprises on the day and so this government, like past governments, has been engaged in elaborate pitch-rolling, ensuring that there are plenty of reports in advance giving a broad idea of what is coming. Not all the stories you might read this week about what will be in the budget will be accurate, or Treasury-sanctioned, but quite a lot of them are.</p><p>One of the measures subject to a lot of pitch-rolling is the proposal to change the official definition of debt used in the government’s fiscal rules.

<p>A superb meditation on animal companionship by a novelist whose pet helped him heal from trauma</p><p>In this exquisite book novelist Caleb Carr tells the story of the “shared existence” he enjoyed for 17 years with his beloved cat, Masha. At the time of writing she is gone, he is going, and all that remains is to explain how they made each other’s difficult lives bearable. The result is not just a lyrical double biography of man and cat but a&nbsp;wider philosophical inquiry into our moral failures towards a species which, cute internet memes notwithstanding, continues to get a&nbsp;raw deal.</p><p>Carr explains how Masha picked him as her person when he first visited the animal rescue centre nearly 20 years ago. She was a Siberian forest cat&nbsp;– huge, nearer to her wild self than most domestic moggies, and utterly delightful, a long-bodied streak of red-gold whose forward-facing eyes gave her the look of a delighted baby.
