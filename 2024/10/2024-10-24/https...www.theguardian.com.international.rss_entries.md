<p>The home secretary mustn’t let herself be held to ransom over the Chris Kaba case. Officers need her support, but so do the public and grieving families</p><p>Dalian Atkinson was a gifted Premier League footballer in his youth. But by the summer afternoon that he died, he was a vulnerable man in the middle of a breakdown, standing outside his father’s house in Telford, shouting about being the Messiah. Two police officers summoned by neighbours were “terrified”, a court heard. Atkinson was Tasered for far longer than guidelines allow, and when he finally hit the ground, PC Benjamin Monk kicked him hard enough in the head to leave bootlace imprints. It later turned out Monk, who was convicted of manslaughter in 2021, hadn’t disclosed criminal cautions for theft and drunkenness before joining the force.</p><p>A black sporting hero; a white officer with a history of dishonesty; a degree of violence that turns the stomach. <a href="https://www.inquest.org.uk/chris-kaba-firearms-office

Some corners of the internet were upset that Guadagnino had the opportunity to direct The Shards – another, newer, Bret Easton Ellis book – but instead chose to work over old ground.

<p>Two big names had a shaky week, while Milan have found their Mr Reliable.

Following that up this season has proved tough for Sebastian Hoeness’s team, who lie 10th in the German league. On Tuesday night in Turin they dominated Juventus, who put in their worst performance yet under Thiago Motta, and were reduced to 10 men after Danilo’s red card. Deniz Undav’s first-half screamer for Stuttgart was rubbed out by the VAR but it seemed Mattia Perin, who saved Enzo Millot’s penalty amid a brilliant goalkeeping display, would deny the Germans. It took some dainty improvisation from El Bilal Touré to land a first Champions League win this season for a club back in the competit

It was announced today that, in its 15th year, the beloved CBBC sketch show will receive a Bafta special award in honour of its “extraordinary cultural and social impact”.</p><p>Based on the bestselling books by Terry Deary, it blazed on to our screens in 2009 and gave patronising children’s programming a hobnail boot up the backside. It spoke to young viewers in a language they understood. Sophisticated sketches were mixed with pop video parodies. The emphasis was always on the gruesome, anarchic, anti-authoritarian and scatological, inspiring six- to 12-year-olds to engage with the past. This was a world of Rotten Romans, Vicious Vikings, Terrible Tudors and Vile Victorians. Plus, of course, plenty of ye olde blood, vomit and poo.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/202

Importing home computers like the Commodore 64 was not only expensive, but also legally impossible, thanks to a law that restricted regular citizens from importing individual goods that were worth more than 50 Deutsche Marks (the Commodore 64 cost over 1,000 Deutsche Marks at launch). Even if someone in Yugoslavia could afford the latest home computers, they would have to resort to smuggling.</p><p>In 1983, engineer Vojislav “Voja” Antonić was becoming more and more frustrated with the senseless Yugoslavian import laws. “We had a public debate with politicians,” he says. “We tried to convince them that they should allow [more expensive items], because it’s progress.” The efforts of Antonić and

<p>The poet’s novel of art and abuse vividly evokes one woman’s quest to uncover long-lost memories</p><p>In this haunting and hypnotic first novel from the award-winning poet, life imitates art and art imitates life. Set between London, Paris and the Amazon rainforest, it’s the story of a painter, Dominique, who hasn’t seen her father in more than three decades; he abandoned their family when she was six. As an adult, she travels to Venezuela to see the Angel Falls, but instead sees her father’s face “in the wildest place on Earth”. Back in London, she receives a letter from him, saying that he is dying. It trembles in her hand “as if she’s holding Angel Falls – a kilometre-long cataract shrunk to the size of a page … She unfolds it and it&nbsp;fills the room.” In time, she’ll tell herself: “I’m not mourning him – I’m mourning his second departure. He only got in touch to leave us.”</p><p>A gravitational force pulls her to Paris, where her father is living in the&nbsp;Latin Quarter.

<p>This bonkers show about on-board doctors who have to fix penile fractures and outbreaks of venereal disease is hilariously bad – and yet somehow, Joshua Jackson pulls it off. What a miracle worker</p><p>It’s Rivals at sea! It’s House on a boat – it’s Houseboat! Which is to say it’s Doctor Odyssey, the latest truly bananas offering from Ryan Murphy. It’s so bad and so fun. I commend it to you utterly and must equally advise against squandering a minute of your precious time on earth watching it.</p><p>So! To floating, sun-drenched business! We are on a luxury cruise liner called The Odyssey. The captain, Robert Massey, is Don Johnson, playing avuncular, because apparently we have all lived that long. Nurses Avery Morgan and Tristan Silva (Phillipa Soo and Sean Teale) are resentfully awaiting the arrival of the new doctor, whom they are assuming from his CV – Yale, peace corps, UN humanitarian prize winner – will be an arrogant old man who will treat them like skivvies.

<p>John Burton was just 27 when he was put in charge of creating Thorpe Park’s biggest-ever project. Once too scared to go on rides himself, how did he become the architect of so many daredevils’ dreams?</p><p>When rollercoaster fans speak of creativity, they speak of the old, the retired or the dead. They speak of Anton Schwarzkopf, late pioneer of the loop, and Ron Toomer, who became the first engineer to haul people up more than 200ft before sending them into a drop. They speak of Alan Schilke and <a href="https://skylineattractions.com/about/the-team/">Jeff Pike</a>, both slowing down now, both admired for their structures that marry timber with steel. They speak of <a href="https://www.coastergallery.com/CP/Maverick_1.html">Werner Stengel</a>, a living legend at 88, one of whose many new ideas was to send passengers hurtling around corners while tilted at 90 degrees.
