Recent research has shed light on how "selfish DNA," particularly LINE-1 transposons, plays a key role in early human development. Once viewed primarily as harmful, these elements have now been found to be essential for the normal formation and specialisation of cells during the embryo's early stages. Blocking their activity causes developmental disruption, highlighting their importance. Researchers also found that LINE-1 helps organise the embryo's DNA for proper growth, a discovery that could influence fertility treatments and research into diseases like cancer.
