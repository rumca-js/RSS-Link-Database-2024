According to this assessment, the current trajectory of international commitments will see the planet's temperature increasing 2.6 degrees Celsius or more over the course of this century. That amount of temperature change would lead to more catastrophic and life-threatening weather events.</p>
<p>UN members are due to submit their latest Nationally Determined Contributions ahead of the COP30 conference in Brazil next year. The NDCs lay out each country's plan for reduced greenhouse gas emissions. One part of the NDCs are to reach the goal set by the Paris Agreement to

<p>The new memo sets up guidelines for military and intelligence agencies for using AI in its day-to-day operations. The memo sets a series of deadlines for agencies to study the applications and regulations of AI tools, most of which will lapse following President Biden’s term.

<p>Playtonic Games’ ode to the 3D platformers of the ‘90s is coming  to modern consoles. <em>Yooka-Laylee</em> is getting a remastered version called <em>Yooka-Re-playee</em> for Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5 and “Nintendo platforms,” according to the press release. It’s possible the plural use of platform refers to the current-gen Nintendo Switch and Nintendo’s next console.</p>
<p><em>Yooka-Laylee</em> is a spiritual successor of sorts to 3D platformers like <em>Banjo-Kazooie</em> and Spyro the Dragon. In fact, some of the people who worked on the original <em>Banjo-Kazooie</em> and <em>Donkey Kong Country</em> helped bring <em>Yooka-Laylee</em> to life.</p>

But after countless requests from the community, the team is ready to trial new spins on the old format with different approaches to team compositions.</p>
<p>Two 6v6 tests will take place in the next season of <em>Overwatch 2</em>. The first of these will get under way a week into season 14. Based on when the current season is expected to end (December 10, given the battle pass countdown), that means the first 6v6 test should start around December 17.</p>

<p>Tapping the button will launch Snapchat’s “Camera Only” mode. This will, technically, let you create a Snap, but there’s a major caveat. The lock screen allows users to take photos, but not add filters or post anything. For that, you’ll have to unlock the phone with Face ID, Touch ID or a passco

## NASA's Webb telescope detects the first potential brown dwarfs outside our galaxy

A team of astronomers, for instance, <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://esawebb.org/news/weic2425/">detected</a> a &quot;rich population of brown dwarf candidates&quot; outside our own galaxy for the first time. The image above was captured using the telescope&#39;s Near-InfraRed Camera (NIRCam) instrument.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We already know of the roughly 3,000 brown dwarfs inside the Milky Way, but Webb made it possible to find candidates 200,000 light years away from our planet. &quot;Only with the incredible sensitivity and spatial resolution in the correct wavelength regime is it possible to detect these objects at such great distance

<p>Isn’t it fun when a relatively minor skirmish over money boils over to threaten (checks notes) <em>the whole Android ecosystem?</em> <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/arm-cancels-qualcomms-license-to-use-its-chip-design-standards-123031968.html"><ins>That’s what’s happening now chip firm Arm has moved to cancel the architecture license allowing Qualcomm to build its chips</ins></a>.</p>
<p>Essentially, back in 2021, Qualcomm bought an AI chip company, Nuvia, which was also an Arm licensee. Qualcomm has used Nuvia’s technology inside its AI PC chips, but Arm feels Qualcomm never sought its blessing to transfer those licenses.</p>
<p>In response, Arm sued Qualcomm in 2022 to try to get what it was owed, with the battle due to go to trial this December. But unless someone backs down in the interim, Qualcomm might not be able to make the chips — the basis for its multi-billion dollar business.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t worry too much, given how high the stake

## Cinemark's Gladiator II AR-enabled popcorn bucket claims 'you can eat war'

The theater chain&#39;s new entry is not only shaped like the Roman colosseum, it plays a cutesy augmented reality gladiator battle when you point your smartphone at QR code on the bottom (AR-ENA, get it?). The butter on the popcorn is Cinemark&#39;s tagline, claiming &quot;you can eat war.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In fact, all of the ad copy is brilliantly cheesy: &quot;Every kernel of strength, every ounce of honor, is for the glory of Rome. As you preside over this gladiator arena, you can... <em>eat war</em>. Finish the popcorn and unleash the battle within. You <em>will</em> be entertained.&quot; Being intoned in the <em>Honest Trailer</em> style takes it up an extra notch.</p>

<p>Tablets are the perfect middle ground between your phone and laptop, giving you the best of both worlds. Whether you want a lightweight device to binge your favorite shows, a larger screen for mobile gaming or a portable way to get some work done on the go, a tablet can do it all. They’re also great for keeping kids entertained, managing work tasks or sharing family moments through video calls. When a phone feels too small and lugging around a laptop is just too much, that’s where tablets fit into the mix.<br><br>For many, the Apple iPad is the go-to choice, and it’s easy to see why with its smooth performance and endless app options. But don’t worry if iOS isn’t your thing — there are plenty of Android alternatives out there, offering the same level of flexibility without locking you into Apple’s ecosystem. Plus, if you’re on a budget, there are more affordable options that still pack a punch. Whether you’re looking for a premium tablet for work, a kid-friendly device with parent
