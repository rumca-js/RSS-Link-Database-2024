Decades after it was first found in Japan, a species of crustacean with unique black-and-white coloring that resembles a panda has been confirmed to be new to science. Melitid amphipods are shrimp-like crustaceans found worldwide. The newly classified Melita panda—named after the charismatic mammal—was first found in the 1990s. Details of the discovery and morphological analysis are published in  ZooKeys.

Imagine falling seriously ill with an infection. Normally, we visit the doctor, are prescribed antibiotics, and after 7–10 days, we're back on our feet. But today, it is no longer guaranteed that the treatment will work. Infections like pneumonia, tuberculosis, or blood poisoning are becoming increasingly difficult to treat, and according to the World Health Organization (WHO), millions of lives could be lost if we don't find a solution to the so-called MRSA bacteria, that can't be treated with antibiotics.

Fast-growing fires were responsible for nearly 90% of fire-related damages despite being relatively rare in the United States between 2001-2020, according to a new study led by the University of Colorado Boulder. "Fast fires," which thrust embers into the air ahead of rapidly advancing flames, can ignite homes before emergency responders are able to intervene. The work, published today in Science, shows these fires are getting faster in the Western U.S., increasing the risk for millions of people.

A study published today in the journal Environmental Research Letters, has revealed a staggering $79 billion in annual climate-related costs from the production of common materials in the United States. These costs, which stem from greenhouse gas emissions, are not reflected in current market prices, effectively creating a massive subsidy for carbon-intensive industries.
