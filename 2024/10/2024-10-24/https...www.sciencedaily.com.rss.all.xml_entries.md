The ideal material for interfacing electronics with living tissue is soft, stretchable, and just as water-loving as the tissue itself--in short, a hydrogel. Semiconductors, the key materials for bioelectronics such as pacemakers, biosensors, and drug delivery devices, on the other hand, are rigid, brittle, and water-hating, impossible to dissolve in the way hydrogels have traditionally been built. Scientists have now solved this challenge that has long stymied researchers, reimagining the process of creating hydrogels to build a powerful semiconductor in hydrogel form. The result is a bluish gel that flutters like a sea jelly in water but retains the immense semiconductive ability needed to transmit information between living tissue and machine.

After only one to three days of a whiplash injury, scientists can predict which patients will develop chronic pain based on the extent of cross 'talk' between two regions of the brain, and the person's anxiety level after the injury, according to a new study . The study showed the more the hippocampus -- the brain's memory center -- talked to the cortex -- involved in long term memory storage -- the more likely the person is to develop chronic pain. In addition, the higher a person's anxiety immediately after the car accident, the more precisely scientists could predict the chronic pain people reported one year after the accident. This is the first study to show that only a few days after a given injury, the brain can adapt in a way that imparts a risk for the development of chronic pain.

Fluoropolymers have become an integral part of modern society, both in industrial and consumer applications. When these high-performance materials reach the end of their useful life, they can end up in both industrial and household waste. Researchers analyzed the contribution of waste incineration of fluoropolymers to the release of low-molecular, non-polymeric fluorinated compounds. Their experiments showed nearly complete destruction of fluoropolymers in combustion at the temperatures and residence times typical of European incinerators.
