This review of the Intel 285K CPU includes gaming benchmarks, looking at some of the best gaming CPUs in 2024, power efficiency comparisons of Intel vs. AMD, workstation and Adobe application benchmarks, and more. This benchmark focuses on the Intel Ultra 9 285K vs. AMD R7 7800X3D in gaming, the 285K vs. 14900K, 14700K, and 9950X in production and efficiency, and also features AM4's 5700X3D, alongside nearly 30 other CPUs. The Intel Core Ultra 9 285K releases on October 24, 2024, and has an MSRP of $590, but we found it typically higher. Its value is poor versus the 7800X3D in gaming and challenged by the 9950X in production. AMD is expected to launch its AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D CPU on November 7, 2024.\n\nThese new testing processes are expensive to research and implement and take significant time. We reduce our video output to focus on quality of testing for these research pe", "id": 1381905, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXLY8kEdR1c", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 428, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UChIs72whgZI9w6d6FhwGGHA", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/XXLY8kEdR1c/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Get It Together, Intel: Core Ultra 9 285K CPU Review & Benchmarks vs. 7800X3D, 9950X, More", "vote": 0}]
