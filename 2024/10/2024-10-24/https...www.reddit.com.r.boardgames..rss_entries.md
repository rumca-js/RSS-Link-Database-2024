<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone,</p> <p>My spouse’s birthday is coming up, and I’m planning something special—a homemade murder mystery game! Instead of buying one of those expensive kits, I want to create it myself and make it really unique. The game will be set in our home, and I’m aiming for a mystery that takes about an hour to solve, with hidden clues scattered around the house.</p> <p>The idea is for my spouse to play as the detective, uncovering clues like the murder weapon, time of death, and the motive, all while encountering a few surprising twists along the way. I want it to be challenging enough for adults but not too complex that it becomes frustrating. I’d love some advice on how to structure the game, create interesting puzzles, and make sure it has a good balance of fun and mystery.</p> <p>Has anyone done something like this before or have any tips on creating a well-thought-out game? Any ideas for creative twists or puzzles are also welcome!</p> <p>Tha

My husband speaks English and loves Sequence, he says it tickles his brain. LOL. My in-laws are Japanese and don’t speak any English. We have played Phase 10 with them and they enjoy it because they don’t need English to play the game. We tried Ticket to Ride with them but it was overwhelming for them. I would love to find 4 person games to play with them. They are in their 60’s. I want us to all play together around the dinner table. I find games help me because I can bond with them even though I don’t speak Japanese and they don’t speak English. My husband can explain/translate the rules of the games to them, so that isn’t a problem.

There are monsters (imps, trolls and demons, which can steal mana, break locations or simply kill you, respectively) and elementals disasters (which might drown or burn everyone: water and fire). Plus a bit less nasty little things like ice, darkness and ghosts. </p> <p>Students achieve this with variety of spell cards with fixed effect (for example, one can inflict 2 damage with lightning or evaporate water in a location).

There are lots of others here at the RV park, all here for treatment at the same hospital, so I am hoping to get some groups playing at night. I just learned Mexican train but didn’t pack it as we left quickly. What would you recommend for fun, easy to learn and easy to play games? Thank you! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/rovingretiree"> /u/rovingretiree </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1gaquz6/help_need_ideas_for_games/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1gaquz6/help_need_ideas_for_games/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi folks, I saw that FF&#39;s Free Ride USA got a pretty high Dice Tower review now that it has the colored cards and regions. Is anyone excited about this? Is Free Ride a good, tense game? Is it kind of like Hansa Teutonica in its tension? Speaking of which, is Hansa Teutonica a secret route building train game? you are building routes, and building trade houses (train stations) in the cities? I dont know how to explain the cube bumping mechanism in the train theme. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/FattyMcFattso"> /u/FattyMcFattso </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1gaptl3/free_ride_usa_update_version_of_free_ride_with/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1gaptl3/free_ride_usa_update_version_of_free_ride_with/">[comments]</a></span>

How does one do research and learn about these games beforehand, especially since some only print for the market itself.</p> <p>Any advice is greatly appreciated.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/StuTeacher82"> /u/StuTeacher82 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1gapm90/tokyo_game_market_24_autumn_hype/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1gapm90/tokyo_game_market_24_autumn_hype/">[comments]</a></span>
