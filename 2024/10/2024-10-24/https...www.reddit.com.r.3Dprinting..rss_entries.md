<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Yes, I know that &quot;everyone&quot; knows you have to keep it dry. But &quot;dry&quot; can be very relative. I live in a dry climate in AZ, but even so, had a real experience with some older filament. I was shocked at the ridiculous mess that I got from some filament at 27% versus drying it down to 10-15%. The wet prints were completely unusable. Not just bad, but completely junk. They behaved like there was 50% less material and fell apart easily. No strength, no adhesion. I&#39;d always heard that under 30% is ok, and maybe it is with some filaments.</p> <p>I ran the spool in a drier for around 8 hours, and printed the exact same file again. Nearly perfect. Or as good as I ever get from these metallic PLA filaments. Minor imperfections but no defects that really matter.</p> <p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/YUZGi9u">https://imgur.com/a/YUZGi9u</a></p> <p>The stuff on the left is the junk, right is all perfect.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t believe I have never used it before. I am building 2 Ghostbusters proton packs for Halloween for my daughter and I. I printed two V-hooks out of PLA, wore one pack to a party last week and the male part cracked, it made it though the party but just barely. So I did some research and every thing I saw said use PETG, so I ordered some and printed 2 more with 100% infill and they are solid, probably the strongest thing I have ever printed. It was so easy too, my ender 3 just printed all 4 pieces first try. I feel like a whole new world of printing has opened up for me.. sorry if this is funny to some of you who know about PETG, but like all thing you don&#39;t know till ya know </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/people_skills"> /u/people_skills </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/1gaua9j/petg/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com
