<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello! Long time lurker here. I am definitely a beginner in the self hosting/homelabbing/networking world, but I am really loving the learning process.</p> <p>I currently use a 2bay synology NAS as a media server via SMB over LAN. It is running RAID 0.</p> <p>I have been considering upgrading to a 2U 8bay rackable synology NAS as I am beginning to need more storage and it would fit neatly in my rack. </p> <p>Recently Ubiquity announced the UNAS pro. It (strangly) has 7 disk bays and is also 2U. I thought this was an amazing option since I already have UNIFI network equipment and it is less that half the price of an &quot;equivalent&quot; synology machine. But I have some doubts/concerns.</p> <p>It doesnt support RAID 0... and I am not sure what raid level would be most viable for media streaming. I would think that RAID 10 is most optimal, but wouldn&#39;t I be losing half the storage capacity. What RAID level would you use for a media server if 0 wa

TuneSplit is a webapp that splits your audio tracks into instrumentals and vocals (stem separation).</p> <h2><a href="https://tunesplit.rudydelorenzo.ca/">Demo</a></h2> <h1>What is stem separation?</h1> <p>This is the process of separating a music track into its constituent parts. Basically song goes in, instruments and vocals come out separately.</p> <h1>What does TuneSplit do?</h1> <p>When you drop a music track into the TuneSplit interface it will send it to the backend, and it in turn will use the wonderful <code>demucs</code> separation library to perform the stem splitting.</p> <p>It has two separation modes:</p> <ul> <li>2 stems (vocals and instrumental)</li> <li>4 stems (vocals, bass, drums, other)</li> </ul> <p>It also supports GPU acceleration!

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi, for a while now, if I need to make a quick edit to a video I have, or maybe an image, etc, I usually use sites like <a href="https://online-video-cutter.com/">this one</a> to do the job, video wise. (123apps is a great website, nothing wrong with it)</p> <p>The issue is that sometimes it can take a while, or more so, theres a file size limit. This means if I want to get something done fast, or my video is big (alot of them are), I need to use an app on the computer that im using, which said app can take a while to launch and drains the battery quickly. Its also not as conveient as something like 123apps.</p> <p>Is there any selfhosted solutions to the &quot;tool editing&quot; sites that you can find everywhere? A great example of this is <a href="https://github.com/imputnet/cobalt/pkgs/container/cobalt">cobalt</a>, a site that can save youtube videos and much more, and if you wanted to, im (pretty sure?) you can host your own instance if im corre

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I selfhost a lot of services, and recently I&#39;ve started getting &quot;NS_ERROR_CORRUPTED_CONTENT&quot; and sometimes even HTTP/522s when trying to browse to services on my prod VM. They&#39;re all docker containers reverse proxied with Caddy and routed via Cloudflare, and they are responding to requests slower and slower as time goes on. System resources sit around 3% CPU use, 24% RAM use (plus another 30% use by cache), disks have more than enough free space available, and network usage caps out at around 300kbps up or down at any given time on a gigabit connection. Why on earth might things be failing like this? Has anyone else seen a situation like this?</p> <p>This seems to specifically affect javascript requests.

It is an email server where you can generate disposable email addresses.</p> <p><strong>Purpose</strong><br/> The main purpose of this service is so that you can sign up to websites without having to use your primary email address (when you want to try out new services). This prevents your primary email address being sold to advertisers / leaked in a data breach.</p> <p><strong>Easy to use</strong><br/> I have designed it so that it&#39;s extremely easy to setup and use. Only `docker compose up`. Changing domain, moving to another machine, etc requires no additional configuration. It just works.</p> <p><strong>Future plans</strong><br/> If this project gets enough star, I am also planning to add a feature where it can forward received email to your primary email so that it acts like a proxy.</p> <p>NortixMail: <a href="https://github.com/NRicode/NortixMail">NRicode/NortixMail: Nortix Mail - private d

The former is much more important than the latter, but both highly appreciated.</p> <p>I&#39;ve found SMTP2GO which seems to behave decently ok with privacy, but I was wondering if there&#39;s anything more privacy focused.</p> <p>Not sure if it makes a difference, but I have 4 custom domains that I&#39;d like to use. I understand that the relay does not care that much about that (?) as I will be using Mailcow for that, but a wiser redditor can correct me if I&#39;m wrong.</p> <p>Any help would be highly appreciated.</p> <p>Thanks in advance :

I&#39;m using Google photos (and it works great) but the annual cost is not so great. Ideally I&#39;m looking for something that can sync photos across iOS and Android, with easy backup options to external storage or cloud. I’d prefer something low maintenance that allows good photo organization like auto-sorting or tagging or AI recognition (I&#39;ve looked at Immich). I’m also considering setting this up on hardware like a NAS, but I don’t need RAID configurations or high availability—just a simple place to organize and back up my photos. I&#39;ve looked at Synology but honestly I feel overwhelmed by the amount of options. </p> <p>Any recommendations would be appreciated!

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey all,</p> <p>I have been using SWAG and Authentik to secure my server&#39;s applications for external access and it&#39;s been working well. I wanted to make some quality-of-life tweaks by adding OIDC. I previously had Authentik setup with each application provider set to Forward Auth Proxy (Single Application) and routed it through Authentik&#39;s outpost. This works as intended. When I switch the provider to OAuth2 for OIDC, the logs show 404 errors. If I test locally and replace my subdomain entries in Authentik with my local IP and application ports, OIDC works perfectly. I assume the issue would be related to SWAG&#39;s authentik-location.conf referring to the outpost for auth requests and the OAuth2 providers not being an option in the outpost within Authentik. I don&#39;t know enough to properly troubleshoot beyond this point without some direction from my betters. If anyone has suggestions or ideas, I&#39;d appreciate it!</p> <p>**UPDATE**
