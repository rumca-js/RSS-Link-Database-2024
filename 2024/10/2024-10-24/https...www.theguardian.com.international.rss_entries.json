And then there is \u2026 Kelly Clarkson <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2015/08/every-kelly-clarksons-live-cover-ranked.html\">covering</a> your song.</p><p>A practice that began when she was touring, taking cover requests from fans, Kelly Clarkson now has a daytime talkshow in which every episode she does Kellyoke and covers a song she loves. Why, you might ask? It\u2019s simple \u2013 because she can, and also she should. She\u2019s amazing at it. I\u2019m not saying every time she does a cover she makes it her own, but she definitely shows everyone what your song sounds like when it\u2019s belted by one of our greatest living singers.</p> <a href=\"https://ww", "id": 1380656, "language": "en-US", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/25/kelly-clarkson-kellyoke-covers-chappell-roan", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 341, "source_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be31de06dea92431acc33a5fb337f3db239a6411/0_0_2759_1656/master/2759.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=02355110ea106f57b736097e14e525b1", "title": "When can you change the lyrics on song covers?
