That’s the right to decide which technology you use, and how you use it. Technological self-determination is important for every technology user, and it’s </span><i><span>especially </span></i><span>important for users with disabilities.</span></p>
<p><span>Assistive technologies are a crucial aspect of living a full and fulfilling life, which gives people with disabilities motivation to be some of the most skilled, ardent, and consequential technology users in the world. There’s a whole world of high-tech assistive tools and devices out there, with disabled technologists and users intimately involved in the design process. </span></p>
