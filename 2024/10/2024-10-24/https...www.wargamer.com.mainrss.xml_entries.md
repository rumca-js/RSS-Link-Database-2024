								<p>Termination, the first free new mission for <strong>Warhammer 40k: Space Marine 2</strong>, ends with a kickass showdown against a kaiju-sized Hierophant bio-titan. Your squad has to power up a battery of defense lasers and then target them on the monster, all while your position is assaulted by hordes of lesser ‘nids and bombarded by the big brute’s lethal bio-acid. It’s a high octane fight that’s got us thinking about all the other Tyranid mega-monsters we want to face in future operations.</p>
