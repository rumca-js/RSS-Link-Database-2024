<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Iâ€™ve just realized I wasted time on commenting on some YouTube random video. However it turns out my thoughts are the ones Iâ€™d like to hear 10 years ago so I decided to share it here as well. Hopefully, youâ€™ll find it helpful some day. Criticism is welcome too!</p> <p>13 years of commercial exp here. Some advices from me: 1. Stop leetcoding, stop doing tutorials, stop chatGPTing. Instead: read docs, write free software that people wants and be patient - it needs a lot of time! Build projects that seem to be &quot;a bit too hard&quot;. 2. Companies tend to promote you too fast on higher levels to make sure you&#39;ll stay with them for a longer time and you&#39;ll fail interviews for senior roles knowing that you&#39;re not a senior. Keep it in mind. 3. Learn how computers work. No matter what language you pick. 4. Learn both client and server side software engineering. 5. Learn how to deploy your apps on VPS/Dedicated server. Optimize and automate it

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone!</p> <p>I recently came across an AI Reddit bot on Product Hunt that can search Reddit and use AI to reply to certain posts. I thought it was a really cool concept, so I decided to try building my own versionâ€”even though I had no prior experience with Python, machine learning, or AI.</p> <p>After some trial and error, I managed to create and publish a CLI tool that lets anyone easily build a bot directly from the command line. The bot can search for specific keywords and automatically leave comments on posts that match those keywords.</p> <p>Itâ€™s still an early version and definitely needs more work, but Iâ€™m excited about the progress so far. Iâ€™d love to get some feedback from this community, so let me know what you think. </p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Firm-Lingonberry-748"> /u/Firm-Lingonberry-748 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://github.com/VashonG/reddit-bot-cli"
