<p>This particular config sports an AMD Ryzen 5 8640HS processor and a hefty 16GB of RAM, enough to smoothly power all those apps you’re going to be multitasking. It also features a 512GB SSD that’s fast and spacious enough for all your files, photos, and videos.</p>



<p>The “360” in HP Envy x360 refers to its hinge, which can flip over all the way to become usable in tablet style (hence 2-in-1 laptop). But the hinge doesn’t have to go all the w

<p>AMD announced its third-generation Ryzen Pro processors for business laptops on Thursday, taking the AI power of its Ryzen AI 300 consumer processors and applying them to the business world.</p>



<p>AMD launched three very similar members of its Ryzen AI Pro 300 family, with core counts ranging from eight to 12 cores. They’ll launch later in October.</p>



<p>AMD launched its Ryzen AI 300 laptop processor for consumers earlier this year, and the Ryzen AI Pro is basically that chip with some additional security technologies layered on top. The AI 300 ushered AMD’s new Zen 5 architecture into the market, with more cores and more powerful RDNA 3.5 graphics. The chip also includes AMD’s XDNA 2 NPU architecture, which more than doubles the available TOPS of the previous Ryzen Pro 8040 series from 16 to 50 to 55 TOPS, depending on the model.</p>

<p>A power bank that can charge both your phone and your laptop is worth its weight in gold while on the go because you never know when you’ll be near an outlet again or if you’ll have time to plug in.</p>



<p>That’s why you need a high-capacity portable charger, like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/INIU-Charging-25000mAh-Ultimate-Compatible/dp/B08VDJP7WN/">this Iniu 25,000mAh power bank that’s on sale for $54 on Amazon</a>, which is a nice 23% discount off its $70 MSRP.</p>



<p>This brick-shaped power bank packs enough juice to fully recharge your laptop from dead, and it offers 100W of charging throughput, which is fast enough to get a MacBook Pro 14 to 50 percent battery in about half an hour. (Alternatively, it can charge a phone 3 or 4 times over.) And despite its size, this Iniu power bank is TSA-approved and perfectly acceptable for airline travel.

<p>Right now, lots of gamers are waiting with bated breath for the sequel to Nintendo’s Switch gaming console. But instead of dropping the Switch 2, Nintendo just came out with a <em>different</em> piece of hardware.</p>



<p>Take a look at Nintendo’s physical alarm clock, called <strong>Alarmo</strong>. And with Nintendo being Nintendo, it’s no surprise that this thing is more than <em>just</em> an alarm clock — it seems to gamify the very process of getting up in the morning, which could be helpful for gamers and non-gamers alike.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Mozilla released the Firefox 131.0.2 update in response to reports that Firefox users are actively being hit by a zero-day vulnerability in the browser. Surprisingly, this is the first zero-day vulnerability discovered in Firefox this year.</p>



<p>In Mozilla’s <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2024-51/">Security Advisory report for the update</a>, the fixed security flaw is listed as CVE-2024-9680, which is a use-after-free (UAF) vulnerability in CSS animations. An attacker who exploits this vulnerability can inject and execute arbitrary malicious code. ESET researcher Damien Schaeffer found the zero-day vulnerability, but Mozilla is keeping a lid on details about the attacks and how widespread they are.</p>

<p>Are you eager to try out the latest bells and whistles in Microsoft’s bellwether flight sim? Good news, then! You don’t have to wait for <em>Flight Simulator 2024</em>‘s full release in November. In a week or two, the game will go into a limited stress test, which is a chance to try it out for free. You might say it’s a pre-flight checklist that you can play.</p>



<p>Microsoft announced the upcoming “technical alpha” <a href="https://www.flightsimulator.com/join-us-for-the-microsoft-flight-simulator-technical-alpha-in-october/">on the official <em>Flight Simulator</em> website</a>, which includes the system requirements for the PC version — which are pretty beefy, even for a hardcore simulation. You’ll need a second-gen Ryzen or sixth-gen Core i7 paired with a GTX 970 card (or equivalent) at the minimum. The game’s “ideal spec” calls for a Ryzen 9 7900X

<p>Intel’s latest “Arrow Lake” desktop processor, otherwise known as the Core Ultra 200S, delivers a shocking one-two punch: significantly lower power consumption and package temperatures compared to its predecessor, while delivering comparable performance. </p>



<p>Well, that’s not <em>entirely</em> true. Intel admits that the “geomean” of several gaming benchmarks for the new Ultra Core 7 265K is actually 5 percent lower than the older Core i9-14900K, and it might fall short against AMD as well. But Intel believes that the power meter will be the benchmark of choice when evaluating Arrow Lake, with power consumption that can draw well over 100 watts less than its predecessor.</p>



<p>Arrow Lake’s power claims are a <em>huge</em> deal and Intel’s not backing down. “Arrow Lake picks up the mantle of Raptor Lake’s top-end gaming performance and delivers pa

<p>Intel’s new Arrow Lake architecture, aka the Core Ultra 200S series, brings AI capabilities onto Intel desktops. But the chip <em>doesn’t</em> use the Copilot+ capabilities of Intel’s mobile Lunar Lake chip — its designers used the older NPU found on Meteor Lake instead.</p>



<p>For now, this means that if you buy an Arrow Lake chip, you won’t be able to use it with some of the new AI enhancements found within <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2472367/windows-11-2024-update-24h2-how-and-when-youll-get-it.html">Windows 11’s 2024 Update</a>, like generative AI and the controversial Recall function. Arrow Lake’s optimized NPU 3 only provides 13 TOPS, while Microsoft set 40 TOPS as the bar for Copilot+ status. Intel still plans to ship more than 40 million AI PCs in 2024, using the vaguer “AI PC” definition that accompanied the launch of Meteor Lake.<

<p>Intel’s “Arrow Lake” processor plans include both desktop and laptop chips, creating two new performance tiers atop its existing “Lunar Lake” laptop processors plus the Core Ultra 200S desktop processors it’s launching today.</p>



<p>Intel disclosed plans for three different product families: the Arrow Lake-S desktop processor as well as the Arrow Lake-HX and Arrow Lake-H processors for laptops. While Intel will begin taking orders for the Core Ultra 200S (Arrow Lake-S) family beginning on October 24, Intel will ship its notebook processors in the first quarter of 2025.

<p>Intel’s latest Arrow Lake processor for desktop PCs fuses its “Meteor Lake” and “Lunar Lake” architectures together, carrying over Meteor Lake’s NPU and Lunar Lake’s abandonment of hyperthreading. Yes, hyperthreading has been banned from Intel’s desktop chips, based on a similar rationale for excluding the feature from Lunar Lake.</p>



<p>Intel launched Arrow Lake, also known as its Core Ultra 200S processor lineup, on Thursday. The chip is Intel’s first “disaggregated” desktop processor, built on tiles, meaning each part of the chip is individually fabricated on a different process. In a twist, Intel unveiled a deep dive into the architecture of Lunar Lake <em>and</em> the models, prices, and performance of the Core Ultra 200S processor. A key omission?

<p>Online shopping is a wonder of the modern age. With just a few clicks, you have access to just about anything you could ever want from the comfort of your own home. Unfortunately, this convenience also comes with some drawbacks.

<p>One of the best ways you can overcome both of these concerns is by using a virtual private network, or VPN. It’s an essential tool for online shopping, helping you find better deals while also keeping your data safe and private. In this guide I’ll show you how to use a VPN to maximize your savings and secure your online shopping.</p>
