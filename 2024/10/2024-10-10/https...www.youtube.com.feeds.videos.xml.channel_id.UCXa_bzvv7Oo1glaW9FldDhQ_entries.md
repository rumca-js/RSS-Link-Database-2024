Given Bloober Team's spotty track record up until now and Konami's recent history, it wasn't surprising that Silent Hill 2's remake had been met with the level of skepticism it had been, but credit where credit is due- the survival horror title has very thoroughly proven its many doubters wrong, including ourselves here at GamingBolt. 

From how faithfully it recreates the best aspects of the legendary 2001 original to how it expands on it with its gameplay and design tweaks and additions, there's a lot to love about Bloober Team and Konami's remake of Silent Hill 2.

Of course, any time a new survival horror remake of this kind comes out, it's unavoidably going to be compared to Resident Evil 2's seminal 2019 remake, which has had a huge role to play in the resurgence of horror games and remakes in general, with Silent Hill 2 itself having clearly taken heavy inspiration from this modern classic. Pitting the two games against each other, however, which one actually comes out on top?
