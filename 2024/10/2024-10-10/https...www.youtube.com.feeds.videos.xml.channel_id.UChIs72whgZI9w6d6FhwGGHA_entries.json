The new CPUs debut major architectural changes for the desktop platform. Thus far, we only have first-party benchmark data: Intel is claiming huge power consumption reductions and efficiency improvements, but at the cost of lower total performance. Intel's raw gaming performance will be roughly equal with the 14900K, according to Intel itself, and sometimes regressive. We'll have a lot of power testing to do.\n\nWatch our Intel CPU fab tour here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUIh0fOUcrQ\n\nThe best way to support our work is through our store: https://store.gamersnexus.net/\n\nLike our content?
