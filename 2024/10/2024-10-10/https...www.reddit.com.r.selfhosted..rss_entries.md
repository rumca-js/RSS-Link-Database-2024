The server has a little speaker attached as well. Ideally the soundboard is then reachable through the browser on the internal network, from where sounds are triggered. Playback of the sound is then on the server rather than locally. I&#39;m open for containerized solutions but i&#39;m aware that it&#39;s probably easiest to run a full VM due to the hardware passthrough (for the audio) being easier than say a dockerized container. </p> <p>I keep thinki
