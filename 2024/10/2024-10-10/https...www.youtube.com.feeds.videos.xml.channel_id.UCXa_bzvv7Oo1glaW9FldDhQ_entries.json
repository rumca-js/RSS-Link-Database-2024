Fans are having fun with the Edit Mode and the potential for interesting Custom Battles.\n\nFor those who have never heard of the series or only played Dragon Ball: Budokai Tenkaichi 3, the question remains: Is it worth picking up? Sure, there are new modes, playable characters, mechanics, and improved visuals, but how does it compare to its predecessor? What are some more significant differences that make it a superior experience?\n\nDragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO launches worldwide on October 11th for Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC.
