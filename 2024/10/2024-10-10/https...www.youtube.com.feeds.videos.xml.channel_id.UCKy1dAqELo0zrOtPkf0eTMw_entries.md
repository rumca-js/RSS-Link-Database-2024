After months of rumors and waiting, Nintendo finally revealed its newest piece of hardware and… it’s an alarm clock. Sorry, an “Alarmo Sound Clock.” Yes, we were all hoping for a reveal of a next-gen Switch successor, too, but it is what it is. And “what it is” just so happens to be a wifi-enabled clock that features smart sleep-tracking functionality and authentic sound effects and animations from beloved games that will gradually wake the user up. You can see all that in the official reveal trailer that none of us saw coming, but if you want to know what the moment-to-moment experience of this latest Nintendo device is like, here you go. Raw, uncut, gameplay. Er. Not gameplay. There’s not really a word for what you call footage of a clock, but that’s what this video is. Are we kidding? Sort of, but not really. Maybe we’ll put up a review of the Alarmo Sound Clock at some point, but in the meantime, here’s one way to pass the time until Nintendo actually shows off a new device that’s

## NHL 25 Review

NHL 25 reviewed by Nick Ransbottom on PlayStation 5, also available on Xbox Series X|S.

There’s no denying that the action on the ice looks better than ever in NHL 25. And it’s nice to see Franchise Mode get some welcome changes to add authenticity for lovers of the mode. But this year's iteration is quite lackluster as a whole, and feels like more of the same as last year yet again. For being the first NHL game available exclusively on current-gen consoles, it’s a shame that NHL 25 is still stuck in the same last-gen rut.

In The Gutter, when frequently fired Walt (Moore) lands a position tending bar and de-roaching shoes at his local bowling alley AlleyCatz, he feels like he’s finally found a home. When money issues threaten AlleyCatz, Walt is pressured by former pro-bowler and current champion drinker Skunk (Carden) to accept his role as the greatest bowler ever put on this earth. While Walt’s love of big checks and in-your-face style of play dominates the pro tour, his detractors, including ratings-obsessed news anchor Angelo Powers and fresh-out-of-retirement bowling-legend Linda “The Crusher” Curson (Sarandon), furiously attempt to snuff out Walt’s flame before it burns too bright.

A free update for Amanda the Adventurer is also out now on Nintendo Switch, bringing improved graphics, performance, stability, and overall gameplay polish. Dive into the creepy new trailer for Amanda the Adventurer for another look at this horror puzzle game.

The story of Amanda the Adventurer kicks off when Riley Park inherits a house from their Aunt Kate and starts exploring what the reclusive woman left behind. In the attic, Riley is surprised to find a stack of VHS tapes next to an old TV set. The tapes seem to be episodes of an early 2000s-era children’s cartoon they have never seen before. Intrigued, Riley pops the first tape into the VCR.

Relatively simplistic at first glance, it appears to have been made locally and features a little girl named Amanda and her loyal yet shy best friend, Wooly the Sheep. While the episode seems charming and straightforward on the surface, an uneasiness begins t

Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft, reviewed by Ryan McCaffrey.

There are certainly pieces of The Legend of Lara Croft series that fans of the Tomb Raider games will recognize; not just characters but locations too, which adds a bit of extra fun for gamers watching this show. And outside of the main villain’s arc (which had me rolling my eyes), the eight-episode story isn’t bad. But just about everything else – characters, story, animation – is mediocre. And that’s just not going to cut it in this age of peak TV, which has produced far better animated video game adaptations than this one – there’s no reason for Netflix subscribers to waste their time on Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft when they could be watching the aforementioned Castlevania (so good it earned a spinoff), Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, and the League of Legends-based Arcane.
