<p>Interim England manager went full-on roar ball for the people but Greece claimed a shock win at Wembley</p><p>Lee Carsley achieved something at Wembley that might have seemed impossible just a few short weeks ago. On a thrilling, almost entirely <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/10/england-greece-nations-league-match-report">shapeless night of international football</a> Carsley made Gareth Southgate look as though, actually, just maybe, he might have known what he was doing, laying on a performance and tactical plan that it was in its own way a wonderfully selfless tribute to his oddly maligned predecessor.</p><p>Ok, Carsley seemed to be saying here. The people want full-on, brakes-off, English roar-ball. Let’s see what that actually looks like. And the answer, of course, in any version of the real world, is... well, what exactly?

<p>Widow of Bobby Kennedy who brought up 11 children after his 1968 assassination and later devoted herself to social causes</p><p>Ethel Kennedy, who has died aged 96, was one of the most active and best-known US political wives of the 20th century. As her husband, Robert F Kennedy, campaigned first for the Senate and then for the presidency, she supported him while also bringing up their children. The 11th and last of them, her daughter Rory, was born after Bobby was assassinated in 1968. From the 1970s onwards, Ethel devoted herself to social causes and was latterly co-chair of the Coalition of Gun Control.</p><p>Her life had been touched by tragedy earlier, when her parents died in a plane crash in 1955. Her brother-in-law, President John F Kennedy, was assassinated in 1963. Two of her children died prematurely – David of a drug overdose at the age of 28 in 1984 and Michael in a skiing accident in 1997, when he was 39. <a href="https://www.historytoday.com/archive/months-past/assas

Two months later, she had an unrelated Dexa scan to measure her bone density. The technician noticed an abnormality in her hip. After additional testing, Yerger was diagnosed with stage four breast cancer – an advanced stage of the disease in which the cancer has spread beyond the breasts.</p><p>The mammogram and ultrasound had not picked up the cancer because, Yerger would learn, of her dense breast tissue.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2024/oct/10/breast-tissue-density-mammogram">Continue reading...</a>

It was their duty to tease me – one of my abiding interests at the time was ventriloquism.</p><p>I was terrified of being left alone, terrified of the dark, scared of UFOs, and perhaps most trickily, stricken by the existential panic of not knowing what to <em>do</em> with myself.

<p>Not everyone will have the stomach for this much gore, but for genre aficionados this Christmas killing spree is a cut above</p><p>Here is a film that opens with a self-contained prologue that gleefully sets its stall out, fair and square. The scene is a family home at Christmas time, the victims are said family, and the perpetrator is Art the Clown, dressed as Santa, wielding an axe. The rules of the film are also made plain: anyone can die and being a cute kid won’t save you, but while some victims are innocent, others earn their bloody endings – at least by the logic of horror movies. (In the case of this opening scene, the husband who tells his wife “I have to be up in three hours, you handle this” is justly marked for death.)<br><br>
