<p>Kevin Roose wrote a column for The New York Times last week under the headline “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/02/technology/apple-social-apps-contacts-change.html" title="The New York Times: “Did Apple Just Kill Social Apps?”">Did Apple Just Kill Social Apps?</a>”, about which <a href="https://sixcolors.com/link/2024/10/did-godzilla-just-step-on-a-bad-idea/" title="Six Colors: “Did Godzilla just step on a bad idea?”">Jason Snell quipped</a>, “It’s rare that a story is worse than its provocative headline, but this one manages it.” The gist of it is Roose positing that Apple’s new fine-grained controls over contact-sharing in iOS 18 are somehow controversial. Roose himself writes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For years now, the way contact sharing has worked on iOS devices
is that an app can trigger a message called a “data access
prompt,” asking for access to a user’s contacts.</p>

<p>If the user agreed, the app developer got a list of all the
contacts in that user’s address

<p>Given that <em>Calvin and Hobbes</em> is almost certainly the best (and almost more certainly, the most beloved) comic strip ever, it’s devilishly hard to pick a favorite. But this might be mine. I thought about it often as I raised my own son.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I sent this one to my son, and he sent me <a href="https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1986/11/26">this one</a> back. My boy gets me.</p>

<p>Mark Gurman, reporting for Bloomberg:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple Inc.’s Dan Riccio, who oversaw the company’s push into
mixed-reality headsets and previously served as its hardware
engineering chief, is retiring.</p>

<p>The veteran executive, a vice president who reports to Chief
Executive Officer Tim Cook, is leaving Apple this month, according
to people with knowledge of the move. Employees in Riccio’s Vision
Products Group, which includes a couple thousand engineers working
on headsets and related technology, were told they would become
the responsibility of John Ternus, Apple’s hardware boss.</p>

<p>Mike Rockwell, Riccio’s current lieutenant, will continue to lead
the Vision Products Group on a day-to-day basis, said the people,
who asked not to be identified because the changes aren’t public.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Gurman’s framing here in his lede could leave casual readers with the impression that Riccio is perhaps leaving because of the tepid consumer response to Vision
