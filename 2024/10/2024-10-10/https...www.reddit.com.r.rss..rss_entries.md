<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m pretty sure RSS is the solution to what I want, but I can&#39;t figure out how to make it happen.</p> <p>Basically, I want a single app where I can read all of the different news sources I now access through dedicated apps and websites. Most apps I&#39;ve found only fetch headlines+blurb, and I couldn&#39;t figure out how to operate the few apps the supposedly fetch the full text. Another requirement I have is displaying RTL languages (ie, Arabic, Persian, Hebrew) correctly. Another important feature, though not required, is the ability to copy text to Obsidian/Omnivore (or eventually, Anytype).</p> <p>I don&#39;t mind a purchase fee, but I don&#39;t want another subscription either. I could figure out why a server might be needed, but I have a Synology NAS that can serve for that.</p> <p>If there&#39;s any resource for dummies with step-by-step instructions that would be very helpful. Thank you</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32
