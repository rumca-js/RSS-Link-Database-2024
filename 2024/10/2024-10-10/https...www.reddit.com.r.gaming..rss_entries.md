Then he asked my gf if she enjoyed the Witcher 3 since she is a gamer too, she said she hadn’t tried it yet, when he said what? I said: “she isn’t into triple A games, she likes small indie games, 2D games and LOL and Valorant, but doesn’t plays story driven triple A titles.</p> <p>And she corrected me saying: hey who said I don’t like them?
