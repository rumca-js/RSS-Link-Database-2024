But picking one particular religion&#8217;s iconography and injecting it into public schools [&#8230;]

What if the reason we&#8217;re so worried about teens on Instagram, TikTok, or Snapchat is because we&#8217;ve fundamentally misunderstood the nature of the digital world? What if we&#8217;re confusing the everyday risks of growing up online with the specter of unavoidable harm? No one is better at covering the moral panic about “the kids these [&#8230;]

The spectacular collapse of the Mayor Adams&#8217; administration is still in progress. Pretty much everyone with ties to the ex-cop, current mayor has either been informed of an ongoing investigation or managed to infer that following multiple raids by the FBI. The mayor&#8217;s handpicked police commissioner, Edward Caban, resigned shortly after these raids occurred, most [&#8230;]

Three years ago, we updated Vizzini’s list of “classic blunders” from The Princess Bride to include “never try to patent troll Cloudflare.” That was when the company announced that patent troll Sable Networks had made that mistake and now needed to be taught a lesson. That lesson is now complete, and Cloudflare has successfully destroyed [&#8230;]

Last week I noted how Elon Musk saw fit to inject himself in the middle of the Helene hurricane disaster by falsely claiming that hurricane victims died because the FCC refused to give Starlink a billion dollars in subsidies.

The Fifth Circuit seems to love nothing more than creating more distance between cops and accountability. But, every so often, it finds a law enforcement member that even it is not willing to redeem.
