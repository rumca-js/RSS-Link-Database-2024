Scientists have discovered a low-cost method to significantly reduce this pollution from hydrogen internal combustion engines by improving the efficiency of their catalytic converters. The researchers found that infusing platinum in catalytic converters with a highly porous material called Y zeolites greatly enhances the reactions between nitrogen oxides and hydrogen, converting unhealthful nitrogen oxides into harmless nitrogen gas and water vapor.

Embryo development starts when a single egg cell is fertilized and starts dividing continuously. Initially a chaotic cluster, it gradually evolves into a highly organized structure. Scientists have now provided new insights into the process, emphasizing the critical role of both chaos and order.

Materials researchers have created a new composite material that combines two incompatible properties: stiff yet with a high damping capacity.

## To make children better fact-checkers, expose them to more misinformation -- with oversight

Researcherers say a pair of experiments with children ages 4 to 7 shows that, given children's natural skepticism and early exposure to the internet's boundless misinformation, it is crucial for adults to teach them practical fact-checking skills. Instead of attempting to completely sanitize their online environment researchers argue adults should focus on equipping children with tools to critically assess the information they encounter.

Researchers developed a rating system to evaluate the plausibility of climate model simulations in the IPCC's latest report, and show that models that lead to potentially catastrophic warming are to be taken seriously.

## Understanding how smiling influences relationship building during real-life conversations

Smiling during conversations often elevates the experience of knowing someone, but this understanding has been subjective. A new study investigated the reciprocal relationship between people who indulge in smiling during face-to-face conversations. The researchers found that speakers smile more when listeners smile more, particularly in paired individuals of the same biological sex. These findings provide evidence of synchronized smiling behavior, highlighting the influence of facial expressions on interpersonal relationships.

Studying microscopic layers of dirt dug from the Tam Pa Ling cave site in northeastern Laos has provided a team of archaeologists further insights into some of the earliest evidence of Homo sapiens in mainland Southeast Asia. The site, which has been studied for the past 14 years, has produced some of the earliest fossil evidence of our direct ancestors in Southeast Asia but now a new study has reconstructed the ground conditions in the cave between 52,000 and 10,000 years ago.
