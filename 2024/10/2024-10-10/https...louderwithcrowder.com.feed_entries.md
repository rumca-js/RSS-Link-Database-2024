	A Flordia State Trooper rescued a dog after finding him distressed and tied up to a pole, submerged in a puddle without a fighting chance against the hurricane.

		Please use your platforms to get the word out. Someone knows who did this.

Subsequently, the most faithful servant to this country is focused on woke projects instead of capableness. </p><p>The left does not support a strong military, which is why they do everything in their power to undermine it. Trump supports it, which is why he mocks the lack of readiness of our forces and how their efforts went from duty, honor, and courage to DEI and insignificant character traits.</p><p
