<p>There are a ton of Shrek movies but not one of them have ever answered this question: Who cleans up the mess when the ogre and his various fairytale villains are done fighting? Square Enix’s <em>PowerWash Simulator</em> finally has an answer.</p>
<p>Dreamworks and Square Enix have teamed up to create the <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_US/news/powerwash-simulator-shrek-special-pack"><em><ins>Shrek Special Pack </ins></em><ins>DLC</ins></a> for <em>PowerWash Simulator</em> available now on all consoles and PC. The new pack adds a bunch of scenarios from the iconic animated films and some new armor and tools to help you scrub down the many layers of crud that have accumulated over Shrek’s world.</p>

The fifth, and unfortunately final, season looks to feature the same unchecked shenanigans and in-the-know humor that has made the show so beloved to Trek fans.</p>
<p>The trailer’s filled with wacky hijinks and jokes pulled from the wide world of Star Trek. Eagle-eyed viewers will spot the Borg, the weird sexy decontamination sauna from <em>Star Trek: Enterprise</em> and a whole bunch of Harry Kims. That’s right. There looks to be at least seven Harry Kims floating around this trailer. My Delta Quadrant bestie is finally getting the respect he deserves.</p>

<p>The title has been “designed for players who love tabletop, board and video games.” It’s a two-screen experience, with players actually controlling many aspects of the game on their smartphone. You know, just like the immensely-popular Jackbox franchise. The “tactical couch co-op RPG” is being advertised as a way for veteran tabletop players to introduce the genre to their inexperienced friends.</p>

The developer and Sega, the game's publisher, said in September that they were pushing back the release date by a few weeks to "deliver the best possible experience for this first installment in a new era of Football Manager." However, the team says it still needs more time to "ensure the game quality and experience meets your expectations and our very high standards." As such, <em>Football Manager 25</em> is now slated to arrive in March.</p>

<p>Despite all the inroads AMD has made in recent years with its Zen desktop CPUs, Intel has broadly managed to maintain one critical edge against its longtime rival: gaming performance. For those looking to eke every possible frame out of the latest AAA games, the company’s recent Core 5/7/9 often outperformed their AMD counterparts. Historically, however, that performance has come at the cost of power efficiency and thermals. Intel’s best 13th-genereation processors are absolute power-hungry beasts. That has limited their appeal, especially as small-factor PC builds have become more popular.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Intel <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/core-ultra-200s-series-desktop.html">detailed it’s long-awaited Arrow Lake processors</a>, announcing five new models arriving on October 24.

<p>Alongside its new family of Arrow Lake desktop hardware, Intel today also gave us a few tidbits around its upcoming Arrow Lake H mobile chips for high performance laptops. First off, they&#39;re not expected to arrive until the first quarter of 2025 — but the slight wait might be worth it, as Intel says they will offer powerful new Xe GPUs with XMX. Thanks to that upgrade, the GPU alone will offer four times better AI workload processing than its previous chips, alongside double the ray tracing performance and twice as much cache (8MB L2).</p>
<p>Notably, though, these new chips will still lag behind the company&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/intel-officially-unveils-lunar-lake-its-copilot-ai-pc-chip-030029548.html">less powerful Lunar Lake processors</a> when it comes to NPU and overall AI TOPS (tera operations per second) figures.

<p>Sony’s line of LinkBuds products has served two key purposes.

<p>Starting this fall, Uber will give its riders new self-identification options if they are deaf or hard-of-hearing and blind or have low vision. The company said that riders with hearing or vision issues often worry about potential misunderstandings that could cause them to miss their ride. If they choose to self-identify on the app, their driver will be notified beforehand and could work with them on their needs, such as making sure they&#39;re picked up exactly where they&#39;re located instead of having them look for their ride.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Uber is also moving the communication preferences settings to the Accessibility page so that passengers can easily change their preferred contact method. If they indicate that they only want to communicate via in-app chat, for instance, their driver wouldn&#39;t be able to call them. The company will start pilot testing another self-identification option for riders with service animals in the US and Canada over the next few weeks, as well. Ub

One of the latest images it has taken is of a &quot;super star cluster&quot; called Westerlund 1, and it <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://esawebb.org/images/potm2409a/">shows an abundant collection</a> of heavenly bodies, shining brightly like gemstones. Super star clusters are young clusters of stars thousands of times bigger than our sun that are all packed in a small area. Our galaxy used to produce more clusters billions of years ago, but it doesn&#39;t churn out as many stars anymore, and only a few super star clusters still exist in the Milky Way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Westerlund 1 is the biggest remaining super star cluster in our galaxy, and it&#39;s also the closest to our planet. It&#39;s loc

<p>We’ve been waiting and waiting, and Nintendo finally did the right thing and announced an entirely new piece of hardware. Alas, it’s not a new console but a very Nintendo-looking smart alarm clock. <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/nintendos-latest-hardware-is-alarmo-a-99-motion-sensing-alarm-clock-not-the-switch-2-140142746.html">The Alarmo</a> has motion sensors that let you snooze it based on your movement. (There is a physical snooze button too.)</p>
<p>You’ll also be able to check how much you move around while you sleep, and the clock has sleeping sounds and music to drift off to.</p>

<p><a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-prime-day/">October Prime Day</a> has come and gone but, as to be expected, there are still a few deals floating around on the internet. This year’s fall Prime Day brought a slew of deals across all categories, including tech, and some of those deals haven’t expired just yet. There’s a chance we see some of these sale prices return in a month when Black Friday comes around, but if you’re keen on getting some of your holiday shopping done now, you still have a bit more time.

<p>In August, Kamala Harris&#39; campaign <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.twitch.tv/kamalaharris">launched a Twitch account</a> in an effort to reach young people and some of the &quot;hardest-to-reach voters&quot; out there. It debuted with a stream of Harris&#39; acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention, which is perhaps what one could expect from an account owned by a presidential campaign. On the evening of October 9, though, the channel streamed live gameplay for the first time — along with a live feed of Vice Presidential nominee Tim Waltz&#39;s speech in Arizona.&nbsp;</p>
