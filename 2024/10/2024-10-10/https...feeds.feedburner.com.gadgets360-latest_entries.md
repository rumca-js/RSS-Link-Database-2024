Hurricanes derive their strength from warm ocean waters, with current theoretical wind speed limits around 200 mph. However, as global temperatures continue to rise due to climate change, experts predict hurricanes could intensify even further. This increase in ocean heat may push the limits, potentially resulting in stronger storms with winds exceeding 220 mph in the future. Scientists like Kerry Emanuel of MIT warn that these changes could lead to more frequent and intense hurricanes, increasing the threat to coastal communities worldwide if climate action is not taken swiftly to mitigate these effects
