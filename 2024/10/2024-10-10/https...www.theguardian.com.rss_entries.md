<p>This insipid, humourless adaptation of CJ Skuse’s blackly comic Sweetpea books has been stripped of everything good. It seems to drag on forever</p><p>I was delighted when I heard that CJ Skuse’s Sweetpea (the first in a series of five books) was being adapted for television. The entire series is wonderful, but the first is the one to beat. The story of Rhiannon, a serial killer of (mostly) bad (mostly) men, Sweetpea hits the ground running and never lets up, blackly comic, as brutal in its social commentary as our girl is with a knife, and with a wit just as lovingly whetted. Rhiannon is that rarest of creatures: an unapologetic female protagonist written just as unapologetically by her female creator.</p><p>Her backstory is such that you can’t be sure whether nature or nurture has made her a psychopath, but psychopath she surely is. At least 82% anyway, according to a BuzzFeed quiz she takes. Rhiannon’s voice sings from the page, the plot delivers twist after turn, with the suspe

<p>Maybe this is what happens when you play all the fun guys. Lee Carsley loaded his starting England XI with Jude Bellingham, Phil Foden and Cole Palmer in central areas, Bukayo Saka and Anthony Gordon on the wings; the dial turned furiously to attack.</p><p>It was a team to excite, the kind that so many England fans have craved. And for very long spells, it was a mess. England lacked control and authority in midfield while they were porous at the back, Greece – ranked 48 in the world – tearing through them with increasing regularity. The gung-ho approach might work on the PlayStation.

<p>Britain’s approach to workers’ rights has been stuck in the past for too long. Labour’s plans can bring the law into the modern era</p><p>Labour’s general <a href="https://labour.org.uk/change/my-plan-for-change/">election manifesto</a> said the government would introduce its workers’ rights package within its first 100 days.

<p>In a world ravaged by war and sexual violence, a new edition of the great psychoanalyst’s works is a reminder of his continuing relevance</p><p>In 1935, Sigmund Freud wrote to a distraught mother that her son’s suspected homosexuality was no cause for lament, “nothing to be ashamed of, no vice, no degradation. It cannot be classified as an illness.” If her son was unhappy and neurotic, analysis might release him from his distress and help him live a more creative life, but it would not, nor should it aim, to make him “straight”. No “conversion therapy” as we might say today. On another occasion, Freud insisted that homosexuality should not be grounds for anyone to be summoned to a court of law.</p><p>Shocking for their time, these statements point to an aspect of Freud’s writing that is little known. Both appear for the first time in English in the just published <a href="https://rowman.com/sp/9781538175163/The-Revised-Standard-Edition-of-the-Complete-Psychological-Works-of-Sigmund

There is something very involving and very personal here: something to do with the slight, pure line of Simon’s unmistakable vocal presence, vulnerable and even fragile, perhaps, but also insistent and durable. Simon is of course the genius songwriter from New York whose speaking voice, to my ear, sounds increasingly like that of Woody Allen. Gibney’s camera joins Simon – a grandfatherly but spry figure – as he works on his latest choral album Seven Psalms, then flashes back to his earliest years with Art Garfunkel, and brings us up to the present.</p><p>Simon says the sensational harmonies of his double-act with Garfunkel were originally inspired by the Everly

<p>Questions on general knowledge and topical trivia, plus a few jokes, every Thursday. How will you fare?</p><p>There was some correspondence about last week’s quiz as to whether the phrase “having at”, as in “having at a neighbour’s garage with a chainsaw”, was the correct usage of English or not. The quiz master contends that if the phrase “have at you” was good enough for Shakespeare, it is probably acceptable in a light-hearted quiz filled with questions on topical news, general knowledge, and one man’s weird niche pop culture obsessions. So why don’t you all have at this week’s version? Let us know how you get on in the comments.

<p>When it comes to terms of endearment, you can’t beat the East Midlands. Even buying a coffee is a delight</p><p>At 8am on Sunday I was desperately short of fuel while heading north from Birmingham. I should have stopped at Tamworth, but I wanted to make my stop in the East, not West, Midlands. So I pressed on. It was Donington Park Services or bust. I made it. Excellent. Donington Park was perfect because it’s roughly at the point where Leicestershire, Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire meet. Peak East Midlands. This would do nicely.</p><p>There was a lot of toastie-based faff at Costa, so I went to Greggs instead, where, by the way, the coffee was really very good. But I wasn’t there for the coffee – I was there for the woman who served it to me. “Have a good day,” I said. “You too, duck,” she smiled.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/10/love-bab-pet-duck-terms-endearment-east-midlands">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The former first lady was rolling out her memoir this week – but the biggest plugs were for her gift range, not her husband</p><p>There was something almost poignant about Donald Trump’s tweets in support of his wife, Melania, on the occasion of her memoir being published this week. On Tuesday, the former president posted on X that he was “very proud of Melania!”, who is characterised in the book’s publicity material as Trump’s “rock and foundation”. It’s wrong, I know, to ascribe regular human responses to either of the Trumps, but watching activity around the book this week, it was hard not to wonder whether the pair’s pantomime uxoriousness caused either one of them the tiniest pang of regret for faking a loving relationship.</p><p>I mean, no, right?

<p>Illness had robbed me of my health, my confidence and my joy. But when my mum brought me something to care for, I regained my sense of purpose</p><p>The life I loved came to an abrupt end when I was diagnosed with severe myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME), also known as chronic fatigue syndrome, in 1997. For years, my world revolved around bedpans, bed baths, wheelchairs and stairlifts. Then an unexpected gift began to revive a sense of joy I thought I had lost for ever.</p><p>I grew up in a gardening-mad household. As a child, I would help my dad tend his prize roses, rake the lawn and carry home the weird-looking leeks and cauliflowers he grew on his allotment. He was my hero and I was never far from his side until he died when I was just 11. From that moment on, gardening lost its appeal: the memories were just too painful.
