<p>Henry Cavill's days as the Man of Steel and Geralt of Rivia may be behind him, but he's got his next franchise lined up. Cavill has signed on to star in the upcoming live-action adaptation of Voltron from Amazon MGM Studios.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/henry-cavill-to-star-in-voltron-movie-1236029518/">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, Cavill is only the second member of the Voltron cast to be announced. Daniel Quinn-Toye, a relative unknown, was also cast in a leading role after he won accolades for performing as Tom Holland's understudy in a Romeo &amp; Juliet production in London's West End.</p><p>No details about Cavill's role were disclosed, but if the film is staying close to the source material then he's likely playing Keith Kogane, the leader of a group of five space explorers who were sent by the Galaxy Alliance to the planet Arus. After their arrival, the team discovers the lost robot lions that let them combine and form Voltr

I dearly hope that I will work with them again, but in this grouping? All of them at the same time? That seems unlikely, and it is breaking my heart,” says Goskaya while holding back her emotions.</p><p dir="ltr">However, despite all this, everyone working on the sh

According to Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio director Masayoshi Yokoyama, the result could have been even stranger: For a while, he wanted to make a fishing game called like a Dragon: Tuna.</p><p>In an interview with the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/10/08/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-interview/">PlayStation Blog</a> (via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/the-next-game-in-the-like-a-dragon-series-was-almost-a-fishing-game-i-wanted-to-make-a-game-called-like-a-dragon-tuna/">PCGamer</a>), Yokoyama shared details about another potential idea for a spin-off. Brainstorming began around mid-2023, months prior to the release of Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth on January 25, 2024. Before the team decided to have Goro Majima go on a pirate adventure, the plan was to feature Kazuma Kiryu as a tuna fisherman, who would set off to sea to fight against fishing boats.</p

Now, five years later, iPhone, iPad, and Mac users will finally get their chance to play Resident Evil 2 on their chosen devices.</p><p>Resident Evil 2's remake was largely faithful to the story of the original title, while modernizing other aspects of the gameplay including the over-the-shoulder third-person perspective of the player's character. There are two intersecting narratives following Claire Redfield--the sister of RE 1 hero Chris Redfield--and a rookie cop named Leon S. Kennedy as they try to survive a zombie outbreak in Raccoon City. One of the primary innovations of the remake was Mr. X, a nearly invulnerable genetic monster who relentlessly pursues the player's character throughout the game.</p><p>This isn't the first RE title to make it on to
