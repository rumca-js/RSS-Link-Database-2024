The Taiwan Strait is about 180 kilometers long. The United States and Taiwan both say that it â€˜s a key shipping and trade route. About half of the world's container ships pass through it. The waters are international and open to all warships. 
However, the Beijing government disagrees, claiming that democratically governed Taiwan is its own territory and that only China has sovereignty and jurisdiction over the strait.
