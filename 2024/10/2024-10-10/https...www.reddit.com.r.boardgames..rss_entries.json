I recall it taking a while to finish so as a young kid we only finished it a couple times 4) I recall having to collect objects which allowed you to continue, I believe through word puzzles and riddles.

However, once placed, can a tile, say in a future turn, be added to the island tile in play? In other words, are the islands always condemned to solitude, or can you make the islands \u201cbigger\u201d by adding tiles to them later in the game?</p> <p>I hope I\u2019m providing enough clarification.

While many design elements are recognizable from hegemony it is quite a different game. The EU, China, USA and Russia are the four parties working on the world stage to be three just successful in trade, diplomacy and military presence. While they military is there, there is no direct fighting, just posturing. It feels very thematic and the conflict and frictions around the table really felt inspired by real world politics, so that was great fun. I also enjoyed the deck building aspect.
