								<p>The <strong>MTG card</strong> Coalition Victory has spiked in price, as a cohort of players continue to buy up banned Commander cards in the expectation that Wizards is going to make them legal once more. On September 30, the day Wizards of the Coast announced it was assuming control of the Commander format, foil copies of this card were priced at $20.40. Now they’re $48.90!</p>

								<p>Gloomhaven is one of our favorite board games of all time, so when I realized that Secret Door’s first video game, <strong>Sunderfolk</strong> was basically Gloomhaven with cute animal characters, I was pretty excited.</p>

								<p>Universal Studios has announced a new series of after-hours live action events, ‘Universal Fan Fest Nights’, which seem to be a scare-free version of the theme-park's hugely popular Halloween Horror Nights. We’re particularly intrigued by the <strong>Dungeons and Dragons</strong> night - Universal Studios has the tech to make this into the most deluxe LARP, or 'live action roleplaying' event, on the planet.</p>

								<p>Games Workshop has revealed a range of spiderlike Dark Mechanicum ‘Stalker constructs’ for its small-scale wargame Horus Heresy: Legions Imperialis. These models are completely new and have never been depicted before in art, but we’re certain that some <strong>Warhammer 40k</strong> book readers will have a strange feeling of deja-vu - this is exactly what we imagine the stalk tanks look like in the Gaunts Ghosts novels.</p>

								<p>People play <strong>Warhammer 40k</strong> for lots of different reasons, but for me, the primary draw has always been the social aspect. It’s a fun activity that I can enjoy with friends and, even when we're not physically playing, we can take a break from the day to day reality of our lives by discussing a <em>fictional</em> fascist hellscape for a change. For a dose of that social gaming goodness, I recently ran my own 40k event - read on, and I'll share my tips for doing the same with your pals.</p>

								<p>To celebrate spooky season, Kobold Press is releasing “special 'monstery' lineages and heritages this month” for <strong>Tales of the Valiant</strong>, its spin on <strong>DnD</strong> 5e. The Broodling might be the most upsetting of these playable bad dreams, a spiderlike humanoid that can make its own 50’ silk ropes.</p>

								<p><strong>Magic: The Gathering</strong> fans are tired of references. They’re sick of pop culture allusions, cards that pick the low-hanging fruit of obvious genre tropes. They don’t want so many cards that link to memes or movies, and if you show them a picture of a well-known MTG character wearing novelty headgear, be it a Santa hat or a British bobby’s helmet, they’ll absolutely flip their lid.</p>
