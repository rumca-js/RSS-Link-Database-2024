Intel's Arrow Lake CPUs have a release date for October 24 and just got announced, including specs and prices for the Intel Core Ultra 9 285K, Core Ultra 7 265K, Core Ultra 7 265KF, Ultra 5 245K, and Ultra 5 245KF. The new CPUs debut major architectural changes for the desktop platform. Thus far, we only have first-party benchmark data: Intel is claiming huge power consumption reductions and efficiency improvements, but at the cost of lower total performance. Intel's raw gaming performance will be roughly equal with the 14900K, according to Intel itself, and sometimes regressive. We'll have a lot of power testing to do.
