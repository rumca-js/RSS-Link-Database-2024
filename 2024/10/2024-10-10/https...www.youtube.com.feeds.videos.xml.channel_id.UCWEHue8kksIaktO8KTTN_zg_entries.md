Create a cutting edge and modern web app using just English. Cursor AI unlocks an amazing ability to build fast and robust applications by allowing you to speak English while it writes the code for you in a code-editing environment. 

While tools like ChatGPT and Claude have websites that make it easy to copy and paste code generated, Cursor brings these tools right next to your code for the most amazing auto-complete tool you've ever used -- far better than anything on the market yet. The best part? A lot of it costs $0 to get started for a _long time_. This entire course cost $0 in AI costs.
