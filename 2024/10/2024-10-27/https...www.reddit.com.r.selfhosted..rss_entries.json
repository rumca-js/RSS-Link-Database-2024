Instead of only giving Vaultwarden SSL, can I set it up so my other containers can use that same SSL too? Because I have a search function on my phone that only allows https searches, so there would be benefit to giving a few other containers SSL as well so I could send queries direct to those containers.</p> <p>What&#39;s the easiest way to give my Container(s) SSL that doesn&#39;t require constant cert updating, and can I share that certificate across several containers?

It&#39;s a bit difficult for me to understand as the synology rack does not really seem to have any super beefy processing unit for the transcoding? I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s just because there&#39;s so few processing power required to transcode Jellyfin videos but right now, if I have movies downloaded that are nicer than usual quality (~4GB), it takes at least 10 seconds to load until the movie starts playing and then some stutters also occur until a bit of the movie is buffered. I&#39;m also not sure if my assumption that the Processor is the bottleneck in my current setup is wrong, the only other thing I can think of is the Storage Box?
