The process will take us through designing a custom PCB, hardware assembly, functional testing, 3D printing enclosures, and configuring automatic discovery within Home Assistant. Throughout the project, I\u2019ll share insights and tips from an engineer\u2019s perspective, covering techniques that can be easily adapted for a range of other IoT projects. We\u2019ll work with a modern ATtiny, an ESP32, and LoRa modules.\n\nMy second channel: https://www.youtube.com/HB9BLAWireless\n\nLinks:\nE32 module 433MHz: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DlbN6pP\nE32 module 915MHz (US): https://amzn.to/4dUO7o9\nESP32 mini: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DmGnwAt (all versions should work) or https://amzn.to/3C8oqTB\nVarious PCB adapters: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_Dc6w2bL or https://amzn.to/4hx7cQn\nSilicone wires: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DkHyrPR or https://amzn.to/4eVnVuQ\nSilicone Dupont w", "id": 1395597, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69hB-pi9mkA", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 17, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCu7_D0o48KbfhpEohoP7YSQ", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/69hB-pi9mkA/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Tips and Tricks for Your Projects from an Engineer (Mailbox Notifier)", "vote": 0}]
