It took me a lot of time and tinkering around to make it work so if someone would like to use it for network-related things - I have prepared a manual - in the attached link. I hope that would make someone less frustrated if also owning this board.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Confident-Owl-432\"> /u/Confident-Owl-432 </a> <br", "id": 1398013, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1gdlhv6/luckfox_how_to_make_it_work_with_wireguard_and", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 471, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://external-preview.redd.it/DLJKWF9RXheJyhq6742A2VDB2aqP_7r1s89cjC_4-nw.jpg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=e4a65c5f5003a2563defe30f39c18372628ed206", "title": "Luckfox - how to make it work with Wireguard and IPtables", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-10-27T16:06:43+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>(NB: It&#39;s MicroPython, not the typo in the subject)</p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/micropython/micropython/releases/tag/v1.24.0\">Release RP2350 and ESP32-C6 support, RISC-V native emitter, common TinyUSB code \u00b7 micropython/micropython</a></p> <blockquote> <p>\u2026 Support for the RISC-V architecture has been significantly extended, to include an RV32IMC native code emitter, native NLR and GC register scanning implementations for 32- and 64-bit RISC-V, support for placing RV32IMC native code in .mpy files and also freezing it, and RISC-V semihosting support.
