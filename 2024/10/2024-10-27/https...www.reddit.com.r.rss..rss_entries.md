<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Looking for an RSS feed that can track multiple subreddits (top-of-the-week posts or have an upvote threshold) and one that can track multiple Twitter users. From the insane RSS throttling it seems both of these have 90% of their options down the drain, are there any survivors left?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/DeliveryEastern7240"> /u/DeliveryEastern7240 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1gdcofb/are_there_no_more_reliable_free_twitterreddit_rss/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1gdcofb/are_there_no_more_reliable_free_twitterreddit_rss/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I want to start using RSS and found this project (<a href="https://github.com/RSSNext/Follow">https://github.com/RSSNext/Follow</a>). If I find an invitation code I want to give it a try. I don&#39;t use twitter and discord that much so I couldn&#39;t grab an invitation code. If you have an invitation code can you please share it with me? Thanks in advance.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/pepperino11"> /u/pepperino11 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1gd77un/rssnextfollow_invitation_code/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1gd77un/rssnextfollow_invitation_code/">[comments]</a></span>
