I mainly played MLB slugfest 2004, spiderman 2 and battlefront 2 when I was a kid. So I never really got to experience the amazing games on the PlayStation 2.</p> <p>Please recommend me some games I should play for the first time so I can properly experience this console. Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ZooterTheWooter\"> /u/ZooterTheWooter </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1gcyqak/never_got_to_experience_the_playstation_2_in_its/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1gcyqak/never_got_to_experience_the_playstation_2_in_its/\">[comments]</a></span>", "id": 1394719, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1gcyqak/never_got_to_experience_the_playstation_2_in_its", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 492, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Never got to experience the PlayStation 2 in its golden era.
