NASA's Perseverance rover recently captured a stunning solar eclipse on Mars, showcasing the moon Phobos as it partially blocked the sun. This remarkable event, photographed on September 30, 2024, was made possible by the rover's Left Mastcam-Z camera, which highlighted Phobos's irregular shape. Measuring about 17 miles long and orbiting Mars at a distance of approximately 3,700 miles, Phobos completes three orbits of the planet in just one day. Unlike Earth's moon, Phobos's proximity results in partial eclipses. These images not only contribute to the ongoing study of Mars and its moons but also provide valuable insights into the mysteries surrounding Phobos's origin and characteristics, enhancing our understanding of the Martian environment.

The Hubble Space Telescope has captured a remarkable image of the spiral galaxy IC 3225, which resembles a cannonball moving through space. Located approximately 100 million light-years away in the Virgo galaxy cluster, IC 3225 exhibits distinct features, including a bright, star-forming arm and a tail of gas. The galaxy's unusual shape results from ram pressure stripping, a process influenced by the dense intracluster medium and gravitational interactions with other galaxies. This image offers insights into the dynamic forces reshaping galaxies in the universe.

A Canadian study found that women with breast cancer who engaged in aerobic exercise during chemotherapy experienced improved cognitive function, often referred to as “chemo-brain.” This clinical trial, involving 57 women, highlighted the positive effects of physical activity on mental clarity and overall quality of life. Although formal cognitive tests did not show measurable differences, participants reported feeling sharper and more engaged. Researchers advocate for integrating tailored exercise programmes into cancer care, emphasising the importance of physical activity in managing treatment side effects.
