Today, we will build the LoRa-based mailbox notifier shown in video #493 from the ground up, including a gateway. The process will take us through designing a custom PCB, hardware assembly, functional testing, 3D printing enclosures, and configuring automatic discovery within Home Assistant. Throughout the project, I’ll share insights and tips from an engineer’s perspective, covering techniques that can be easily adapted for a range of other IoT projects. We’ll work with a modern ATtiny, an ESP32, and LoRa modules.
