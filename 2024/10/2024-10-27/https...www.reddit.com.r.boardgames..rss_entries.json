The players have to find four keys and converge on a single gate without running out of tiles, all going lights out (defeated by monsters) or losing gate and or key tiles. I have played the game a decent amount (by myself once, with a group many times) and I have never beaten this game. I always get fucked at final flickers or just before. Honestly the game feel damn near impossible to beat, which is the fun of it albeit, but had anyone ever managed to escape the Nightcage? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Throwaway12346890001\"> /u/Throwaway12346890001 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1gd23au/has_anyone_ever_defeated_the_nightcage/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/com", "id": 1395024, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1gd23au/has_anyone_ever_defeated_the_nightcage", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 473, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Has anyone ever defeated The Nightcage", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-10-27T02:04:28+00:00", "description": "<table> <tr><td> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1gd0ov4/where_is_this_token_from/\"> <img src=\"https://preview.redd.it/z996eztci7xd1.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5638872f9e7c0f5a31b71fcb73f06562ce1a8db5\" alt=\"Where is this token from?\" title=\"Where is this token from?\" /> </a> </td><td> <!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Anyone know where this is from?
