In this series I talk to people that live and work in Gaming, getting them to share their insights on the business of game entertainment. \n\nToday I'm joined by Chris from the Dead Wargames Podcast, Muse on Minis, ETC ETC because he's kinda been everywhere to talk about Conventions! I first met Chris at a Convention and ever since he's spent years at dozens of booths for lots of companies lending a hand wherever he's needed. Just the experienced eye in comfortable shoes that we need to talk about; how are Gaming Conventions changing in North America?\n\nIf you're a Patron; this episode is also available as an exclusive audio Podcast today as well that you'll have already heard three days early!\n\nGMG is publicly supported.
