That's the dream for a lot of players and while Valve has made encouraging noises about expanding its OS to run on other handhelds, there is a free solution you can try now. Bazzite offers Linux builds similar to SteamOS for popular Windows handhelds, providing the pick-up-and-play ease of the Steam Deck in combination with the power of AMD's fastest mobile chips. So is this solution as seamless as it seems? What's the install process like? And can it match Windows performance? \n</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-bazzite-delivers-the-steamos-experience-windows-handhelds-need-and-its-terrific\">Read more</a></p>", "id": 1396930, "language": "en-gb", "link": "https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-bazzite-delivers-the-steamos-experience-windows-handhelds-need-and-its-terrific", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 107, "source_url": "https://www.eurogamer.net/feed", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/BAZZITE-THUMB.jpg?width=1920&height=1920&fit=bounds&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp", "title": "Bazzite delivers the SteamOS experience Windows handhelds need - and it's terrific", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-10-27T10:00:00+00:00", "description": "<img src=\"https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Fortnite-Zaha-Hadid-20.png?width=1920&height=1920&fit=bounds&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp\" /> <p>Zaha Hadid, the Iraqi-British architect and artist, whose glossy, curvy, arcing buildings have looped and flexed through so many cities around the world, once noted that she had never been asked to design anything of particularly striking significance in London. I wonder what she'd make of the Hadidian, cross-purpose, modular thicket of residential units, parkland, and office space that I helped bring into being over by Blackfriars Bridge the other night. It took about thirty seconds to lay the foundations, and the whole thing was fairly blipped into towering life within a few minutes. By the time I was done, the building soared high over the Thames, more a parody of the Hadid style than the real thing, I suspect, and for that I am entirely to blame. All taken care of in the time it took to eat a packet of crisps.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.euroga", "id": 1395802, "language": "en-gb", "link": "https://www.eurogamer.net/when-fortnite-converged-with-starchitecture", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 107, "source_url": "https://www.eurogamer.net/feed", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Fortnite-Zaha-Hadid-20.png?width=1920&height=1920&fit=bounds&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp", "title": "When Fortnite converged with starchitecture", "vote": 0}]
