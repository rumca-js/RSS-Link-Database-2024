<p>Feathers McCraw is back and implacably frightening as ever in Aardman’s latest, belated outing for everyone’s favourite cheese eating duo</p><p>This Christmas, the BBC are giving us a cracker: the first new Wallace and Gromit for 16 years. It has all the trimmings: Nick Park as co-director; a starring role for the Pontcysyllte aqueduct; cheese. But before its 25 December TV debut, the new film premieres at the American Film Institute festival in Los Angeles – presumably to enable an Oscar run next year.</p><p>But perhaps there’s another reason. For a Halloween premiere feels yet more fitting than a festive one. Wallace and Gromit, lest we forget, has always been surprisingly frightening. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/gallery/2023/aug/21/wallace-and-gromit-the-wrong-trousers-30-exhibition-cartoon-museum">The Wrong Trousers</a> was a classic noir, all oblique angles and chiaroscuro. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2005/oct/14/1">The Curse of the Were-Rabbit<

<p>Any chancellor can fire off forecasts, policies and measures, but the most impactful governments back it up with a bold political vision</p><p>Among the most famous definitions of narrative comes from EM Forster. “The king died and then the queen died” is a story, he said, while “The king died and then the queen died of grief” is a plot.

<p>Bassist, songwriter and founding member of the Grateful Dead</p><p>It is significant that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/oct/25/phil-lesh-grateful-dead-dies">Phil Lesh</a>, who has died aged 84, claimed that one of his earliest memories was of being stunned by hearing Brahms’s Symphony No&nbsp;1. Lesh became renowned as the bassist with the Grateful Dead, but his classical training and wide-ranging musical tastes ensured that his playing stretched far beyond the traditional narrow confines of the bass guitar in rock music.</p><p>The Grateful Dead, formed in San Francisco in 1965, pioneered their own brand of improvisational music, and Lesh’s playing was imaginative enough to enable them to roam freely from rock, blues and country through sprawling jams. Even their most ardent fans acknowledged that their concerts could be hit-and-miss affairs, as the band waited for inspiration. But when it did, the results were unforgettable.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.

<p>There are days when it is impossible not to lay into Manchester United’s many failings under Erik ten Hag. On this occasion, though, the true villain of the piece was the cold, interfering hand of the video assistant referee system. It is true that United’s forwards deserve criticism for failing to win this game during a painfully one-sided first half, but even they could not to do anything about the moment when Michael Oliver, watching from Stockley Park, stepped in with the advice that led to West Ham being awarded the penalty that brought Julen Lopetegui a precious and, at times, deeply illogical win.</p><p>This was an outcome decided in artificial fashion, technology’s creep bemusing and infuriating Matthijs de Ligt, the defender deemed guilty of felling Danny Ings with the score locked at 1-1 during the closing stages. It had looked little more than a coming together. David Coote, the on-pitch referee, did not think there was enough contact to merit a foul and it was a while 

## Cole Palmer the mastermind to give Chelsea victory over Newcastle

<p>Cole Palmer’s star continues to soar and, with it, Chelsea keep improving. This was far from a complete display but Enzo Maresca’s players sparkled in spells and had enough to outdo Newcastle, who are now winless in five and look destined for mid-table irrelevance. Palmer was the mastermind once again, playing a brilliant role in Nicolas Jackson’s first-half goal and then beating Nick Pope early in the second to render Alexander Isak’s leveller a distant memory. If Chelsea lacked the level of control that might make their hyperactive head coach relax a little, they won through explosive bursts of the kind their opponents could not match.</p><p>Jackson’s goal crowned an opening spell in which each side had left sufficient space to give the other ample encouragement. It was a simple enough finish, crisply converted on the run, but the buildup was breathtaking. Palmer’s whipped pass from midway inside the Chelsea half took Tino Livramento out of the picture and sent Pedro Neto, who s

World-weary Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) and Venom, the alien “symbiote” that shares his body, are on the run, from the authorities and the relentless Xenophage invaders, who turn out to be foot soldiers for a far greater evil.

<p>Golden fruit to add succulent flavour while the autumn leaves fall</p><p>I have been buying assortments of apples, dipping into the paper bag without looking, crunching skin, flesh and core as I walk back from the shops. As sure as the leaves fall each autumn, the desire to bite into as many different apples as I can, while the season for local varieties is upon us, never lessens. Good russets, hard as Blackpool rock, are around for just a few weeks, as are those varieties of apple you can pick up briefly from farm shops and markets, such as Ashmead’s Kernel, Worcester Pearmain and, if you are lucky, the crisp, ruby-fleshed Red Devil.</p><p>I added apples to two salads this week, the first a couple of Cox’s with their signature flash of orange and russet, a sharp crunch to a salad of young kale leaves with a roasted peanut dressing. Later in the week, a couple of ice-cold Worcesters, refreshing and slightly tart, went into a simpler salad with walnuts, chicory, Lancashire cheese a

<p>The dark months make nature harder to access, but these simple activities will help you stay connected to it</p><p>As the clocks go back today, it’s worth remembering that even though we may consider ourselves to be a nation of nature lovers, in a recent study people in the UK were found to be more disconnected from the natural world than most of our European neighbours. And the result is a decline not just in nature’s wellbeing but in ours, too. And, though it’s harder to get out and enjoy nature with longer nights and shorter days, the good news is that a new relationship with nature can start very simply, with eight everyday activities close to home. What matters is not the amount of time you spend in nature, but what you do with that time.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/oct/27/the-clocks-go-back-but-now-is-not-the-time-to-hibernate">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The French photographer’s painterly portrait of a woman in a metro station hints at the unknowableness of everyday urban life</p><p>The French photographer Dolorès Marat took this picture in the Étoile station of the Paris metro, near the Arc de Triomphe. Marat was on her way to see her doctor when she passed the woman with the gloves on the down escalator. The picture is typical of Marat’s work, which captures dream-like moments in the everyday life of the city, painterly scenes that always seem to carry an atmosphere of unspecified significance. You are invited to create a little narrative around the descending Parisian woman, passing the swimming-pool tiles of the wall’s surface, adrift in a story of her own. Marat talks of the ways in which her photographs “come from the gut”, and memorialise instants when she instinctively feels “the pulse of [a scene] the blood flowing through its veins”.</p><p>A survey of Marat’s career is collected in a new exhibition and a book, which was

Except it’s happening today, up here in these cream and stucco streets on the edge of Clifton. The sky is the colour of a battleship, the gutters are overflowing and nobody is walking. They are running. Now I am running, too, from a cab to the refuge that is 1 York Place. The picture windows are illuminated by warm orange lamps that act as a beacon against this lunchtime’s early evening light and the dining room is dressed in gent

<p>As the nights draw in we tend to turn to reds, but there are whites which are rounded, full and rich too. Here’s a bunch of ripe, stone-fruited wines made from marsanne and roussanne</p><p><strong>Wildstone Reserva Roussanne, Colchagua Valley, Chile 2024 (£8, <a href="https://www.waitrose.com/?srsltid=AfmBOoqRjtga46vHLcw-hbVaXqC2mohJOcZdnpCuVHNumNY1D5JNCTxr">Waitrose</a>) </strong>There are white wines that zap and thrill with a trill of electric acidity: I’m thinking of the best examples of chablis, muscadet, riesling, and sauvignon blanc, wines that are all about crispness, brightness, energy and verve.
