The Intel Core Ultra 7 265K (is that the name?) is in for review now. You can think of this like an i7-15700K, except it's Series 2, which is in the 200 series, which all makes a lot of sense if you don't think about it at all. The Ultra 7 265K Intel CPU is in for benchmarks vs. the AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D, R7 5700X3D, 5800X3D, the AMD 7900X and 9900X, and Intel's own predecessors, like the 13700K, 14700K, and the 12900K. The 265K shipped alongside the Intel Ultra 9 285K and Ultra 5 245K, which we reviewed and have linked below. We're keeping this review as simple as we can, as we're exiting the review cycle for these 3 CPUs and have spoken at length on them already. The 265K definitely does not find its way into our list for the best CPUs of 2024 -- and certainly not the best gaming CPUs.

These also have several bugs, but we talked about those in the 285K review.
