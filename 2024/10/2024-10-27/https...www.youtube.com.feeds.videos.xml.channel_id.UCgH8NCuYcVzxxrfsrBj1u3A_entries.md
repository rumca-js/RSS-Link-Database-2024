First of all, I'm sorry for the shortness of the song clips. We were pummelled by Copyright restrictions on the track in a way we've never seen - so it really limited what we could show. 
Please watch the video and listen to the whole track here:

I confess I am no expert on Linkin Park's catalogue and I'm not sure what I was expecting, but it wasn't this.

'Dreams on Toast' - the new Darkness album - is released in March - and we'll be going on tour:
