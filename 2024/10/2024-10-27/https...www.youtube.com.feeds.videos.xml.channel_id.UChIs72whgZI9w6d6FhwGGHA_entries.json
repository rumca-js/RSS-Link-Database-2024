You can think of this like an i7-15700K, except it's Series 2, which is in the 200 series, which all makes a lot of sense if you don't think about it at all. The Ultra 7 265K Intel CPU is in for benchmarks vs. the AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D, R7 5700X3D, 5800X3D, the AMD 7900X and 9900X, and Intel's own predecessors, like the 13700K, 14700K, and the 12900K. The 265K shipped alongside the Intel Ultra 9 285K and Ultra 5 245K, which we reviewed and have linked below. We're keeping this review as simple as we can, as we're exiting the review cycle for these 3 CPUs and have spoken at length on them already. The 265K definitely does not find its way into our list for the best CPUs of 2024 -- and certainly not the best gaming CPUs.\n\nThese also have several bugs, but we talked about those in the 285K review.\n\nWatch our Intel Core Ultra 9 285K review here: https://w", "id": 1394979, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cqSz4k_HDs", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 428, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UChIs72whgZI9w6d6FhwGGHA", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/7cqSz4k_HDs/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Intel Core Ultra 7 265K CPU Review & Benchmarks vs. 285K, 245K, 7800X3D, 7900X, & More", "vote": 0}]
