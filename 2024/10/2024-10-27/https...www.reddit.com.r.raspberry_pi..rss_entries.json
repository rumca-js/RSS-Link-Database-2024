Great! It works, but then, when going to the pi itself, nothing I do will allow vlc to run from the script. I have been #$%#ing around for several hours. There is no way to run vlc in local environment. Anyone do it successful? I need a sample python script that will simply run vlc and play a file. It works great RDP, but on the device, it doenst run VLC, and gives no additional information on why.
