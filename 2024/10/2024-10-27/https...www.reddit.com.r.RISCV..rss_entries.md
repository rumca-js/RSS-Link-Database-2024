It took me a lot of time and tinkering around to make it work so if someone would like to use it for network-related things - I have prepared a manual - in the attached link. I hope that would make someone less frustrated if also owning this board.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Confident-Owl-432"> /u/Confident-Owl-432 </a> <br

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>(NB: It&#39;s MicroPython, not the typo in the subject)</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/micropython/micropython/releases/tag/v1.24.0">Release RP2350 and ESP32-C6 support, RISC-V native emitter, common TinyUSB code · micropython/micropython</a></p> <blockquote> <p>… Support for the RISC-V architecture has been significantly extended, to include an RV32IMC native code emitter, native NLR and GC register scanning implementations for 32- and 64-bit RISC-V, support for placing RV32IMC native code in .mpy files and also freezing it, and RISC-V semihosting support. Testing for RISC-V is done with the qemu and unix ports, and the support is utilised in the esp32 and rp2 ports.</p> </blockquote> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/scruss"> /u/scruss </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1gdednr/micropyton_v1240_brings_riscv_support_esp32c6/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="ht

## Confusion about immediate of J-type instructions

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>From what I&#39;ve seen online, J-type instructions are formatted like this in RV32:</p> <p>imm[20|10:1|11|19:12], rd, opcode</p> <p>The way I read this is that bit 31 of the instruction will be bit 20 of the imm, 30 of the inst is bit 10 imm, 29 is 9, ect. Is that incorrect?</p> <p>The order of the bits in the immediate field seems out of order and random. I know that J type instructions load the lower 21 bits as after shifting left by one and then sign extending to 32 bits. However, I fail to see how this immediate format makes doing any of that easier.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/BagStreet6618"> /u/BagStreet6618 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1gd1wh7/confusion_about_immediate_of_jtype_instructions/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1gd1wh7/confusion_about_immediate_of_jtype_instructions/">[comments]</a></span>
