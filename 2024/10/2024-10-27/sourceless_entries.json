We estimated the potential impact of reducing salt intake on CVD events in China, via systolic blood pressure (SBP).\n\nMethods To develop our model, we extracted the effect of salt reduction on SBP from a meta-regression of randomised trials and a population study, and that of SBP on CVD risk from pooled cohort studies.\n\nResults Reducing population salt intake in China by 1 g/day could lower the risk for ischaemic heart disease by about 4% (95% uncertainty interval 1.8%\u20137.7%) and the risk for stroke by about 6% (2.4%\u20139.3%). Should this reduced salt level be sustained until 2030,~9 million (M) (7M\u201310.8M) CVD events could be prevented, of which ~4M (3.1M\u20134.9M) would have been fatal. Greater and gradual salt intake reductions, to achieve WHO\u2019s target of 30% reduction by 2025 or the Chinese government\u2019s target of \u22645 g/day by 2030, could prevent ~1.5", "id": 1394664, "language": "en", "link": "https://nutrition.bmj.com/content/5/2/164", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source_url": "", "status_code": 200, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://nutrition.bmj.com/sites/default/files/highwire/bmjnph/5/2.cover-source.jpg", "title": "Reducing daily salt intake in China by 1 g could prevent almost 9 million cardiovascular events by 2030: a modelling study", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": null, "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-10-27T00:55:11.118934+00:00", "description": "Michelle Obama says Donald Trump's not competent enough to be president ... blasting the former prez for the mistakes she feels he made in his first term -- and, saying he straight-up tried to steal the job.", "id": 1394665, "language": "en", "link": "https://www.tmz.com/2024/10/26/michelle-obama-says-people-overlook-donald-trump-gross-incompetence", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source_url": "", "status_code": 200, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/6d/16by9/2024/10/26/6d7d69f660564f20a789c195d648ae64_xl.jpg", "title": "Michelle Obama Blasts Donald Trump's 'Gross Incompetence' at Kamala Harris Rally", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": null, "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-10-27T00:56:10.252392+00:00", "description": "Will the Yankees get even or will the Dodgers add to their lead?", "id": 1394666, "language": "en", "link": "https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/41942747/2024-world-series-game-2-new-york-yankees-los-angeles-dodgers-updates-analysis-takeaways", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source_url": "", "status_code": 200, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2024%2F1026%2Fr1405912_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "title": "World Series Game 2: Dodgers-Yankees live updates, analysis", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": null, "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-10-27T00:56:36.622140+00:00", "description": "Chicago Bears CB Jaylon Johnson is not concerned with whether Commanders QB Jayden Daniels can play in their game Sunday.", "id": 1394667, "language": "en-US", "link": "https://heavy.com/sports/nfl/chicago-bears/jaylon-johnson-jayden-daniels-injury-commanders", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 29, "page_rating_contents": 91, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source_url": "", "status_code": 200, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Caleb-Jayden-e1729984824544.jpg?quality=65&strip=all", "title": "Bears Star Jaylon Johnson Sounds Off on QB Jayden Daniels' Injury Concerns", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": null, "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-10-27T00:57:29.756976+00:00", "description": "The NFL passed down two fines from the Week 7 matchup between the Kansas City Chiefs and the San Francisco 49ers.", "id": 1394668, "language": "en-US", "link": "https://heavy.com/sports/nfl/kansas-city-chiefs/49ers-bryan-cook-trent-williams-fines", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 29, "page_rating_contents": 91, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source_url": "", "status_code": 200, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Bryan-Cook-e1729978256277.jpg?quality=65&strip=all&w=780", "title": "Chiefs-49ers Skirmish Results in Mutiple NFL Fines: Report", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": null, "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-10-27T00:57:51.850546+00:00", "description": "Welcome back to Week in Review.
