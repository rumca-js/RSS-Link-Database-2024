The Birmingham Odeon show opened with a set from rural Worcestershire’s pre-Raphaelite goths And Also the Trees, whose early albums remain a guilty pleasure, and about whom I once sent a self-aggrandising letter to <em>ZigZag</em> magazine. The Cure’s set drew heavily on the dark post-punk fundamentalism of <em>Seventeen Seconds, Faith </em>and <em>Pornography</em><em>, </em>but previewed eight songs from the unreleased <em>The Top</em>, evidencing a worrying drift towards melody, not what the 15-year-old me wanted at all.</p><p>The ticket cost £4.50 and I bought it before Andy Anderson, who was black, was announced as the new drummer.

<p>The LA artist says her musically inspired, architectural works are deeply rooted in her South Central neighbourhood as she opens her debut solo UK show</p><p>“Funk is oxygen. It’s life,” according to Lauren Halsey. The Los Angeles artist can recall the day that funk music changed her life. It was the early 00s and she was on her parents’ computer, downloading music from the filesharing website LimeWire, as she did every night, when she happened upon the entire discography of the band Parliament. “It turned me out,” she reminisces fondly. Of the track <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQVaRudcClc">How Do Yeaw View You?</a>, by Parliament sister group Funkadelic, she says: “Hearing that and believing in it in my most formative years gave me a certain confidence to go for my funk.”</p><p>Later, once YouTube had come into existence, Halsey watched Parliament’s Mothership Connection P-Funk Earth tour and made it her life mission to become a member. “Obviously I didn’t make it in

<p>Deaths rose 30% last year, partly due to a rise in purity, but the stigma over drug abuse still stands in the way of funding the means to stop the toll</p><p>Compared with the screaming scare campaigns of the 1990s, anti-drugs messaging is thin on the ground these days. So the casual observer may not realise that Britain has, quietly but surely, lost its “war on drugs”. Amid a steep rise in drug poisonings, a particularly striking statistic emerged last week. Between 2022 and 2023, cocaine-related deaths in England and Wales <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/deathsrelatedtodrugpoisoninginenglandandwales/2023registrations#:~:text=There%20were%201%2C118%20deaths%20involving,males%20compared%20with%20232%20females">soared by 30%</a>.

<p>The World Cup winner has firm grip on the game’s pulse and praises those players taking on the right in his native France</p><p>“I love watching the Championship,” Marcel Desailly says. “Usually I don’t watch a full 90 minutes unless I’m working on a game in the studio. But I love to watch 90 minutes of Championship matches. The intensity is just incredible. And technically, they can really play.”</p><p>Perhaps this was not what you were expecting to hear from a winner of the Champions League with Marseille and Milan, the World Cup and European Championship with France, an imperious defender who spent most of his career at the very highest levels of the game. But in many ways Desailly has always been an instinctively counterintuitive figure. He left Serie A when it was the best league in the world and moved to Chelsea, who weren’t even the best club in London. He moved to Qatar in the mid-2000s, long before it became a global footballing powerhouse.</p> <a href="https://www.thegua

Veteran French director <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/oct/27/on-my-radar-jacques-audiard-cultural-highlights">Jacques Audiard</a> takes arguably the biggest gamble of his career with the eccentric, genre-bending, Spanish-language musical <em>Emilia Pérez</em>. Set in Mexico, it deals with female empowerment, cartel violence and the epidemic levels of disappearances in the country, as well as gender reassignment surgery and transitioning – all explored with endearingly shoddy song and dance numbers. It’s a startling departure for Audiard, but in some ways it’s also a consolidation of themes of reinvention that he has been exploring on and off throughout his career.</p><p>His 1996 breakthrough picture, <em>A Self-Made Hero</em>, followed an impostor

<p>Our kids have embraced body positivity, but has diet culture merely been replaced by the quest for flawless skin?</p><p>I didn’t see the aurora, but I tried. At 10 or 11pm, I looked out of my bedroom window and squinted, and saw only darkness, but even so I found some lovely pleasure in it. The knowledge that something was happening in the sky, that all along my road people were standing in their gardens and angling their cameras towards the same big tree, and afterwards scrolling to see what they’d caught, sharing them on the street WhatsApp at midnight with pride. The next day, news sites reported on the northern lights as if they were young women getting out of cars – they “stunned”, “radiant”. I liked the way we were all united briefly in our lazy pursuit of beauty.</p><p>Elsewhere in my life, the search for beauty feels more treacherous.
