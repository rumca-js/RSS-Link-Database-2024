I wanted to creat a tool carriage as stiff as possible and developed a system that loads the tool onto its own rail. So far everything works great and is super stable. The changing mechanism is not the fastest, but im positiv, that i can reach normal printing speeds of a vzbot without losses in quality. Getting to this point took alot of hours, so im just excited rig

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi! I am only looking to understand others point of view when they parrot this claim. I believed that it was true until I began replacing my workhorses with Bambu machines. At this point, I run 5 of them nearly 24/7 and have replaced a couple pieces here and there in both the printer and AMS systems. </p> <p>Honestly... I just don&#39;t see it? Every single repair I&#39;ve done on these things has made sense and the parts were cheap and readily available from both Bambu labs and 3rd party providers. If you disassemble an AMS, you&#39;ll see how simple it is. A lamen could probably follow a quick YouTube tutorial and build one themselves... The printer itself is much easier to diagnose and repair than any Creality machine I&#39;ve worked with, but I realize that&#39;s not a lot of experience. </p> <p>Where does the impossible to repair sentiment come from? Honestly just curious. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.r
