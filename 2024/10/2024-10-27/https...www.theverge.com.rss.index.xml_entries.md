  <p id="UniBSR">Ever wondered why some of your Instagram videos tend to look blurry, while others are crisp and sharp? It’s because, on Instagram, the quality of your video apparently depends on how many views it’s getting. That’s according to a video AMA from Instagram head Adam Mosseri, in which he explained why some videos are lower-quality than others.</p>
<p id="FfBsCe">Here’s part of Mosseri’s explanation, from the video, which was <a href="https://www.threads.net/@lindseygamble_/post/DBkEJmJvprg?xmt=AQGzMcoJTajdK4dS4gfBv7SJBfPs5h1TAx-Ma84165CHPg">reposted</a> by a Threads user today:</p>

  <p id="MdkYT0">When the Mac Mini was first introduced in early 2005, it was pitched as a compact, “stripped down” desktop — and the most affordable Mac in Apple’s lineup. Steve Jobs referred to it as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJpZGeihy0s">a “BYODKM” system</a>: you’d bring your own display, keyboard, and mouse, and the Mini would provide a dependable computing experience with all the benefits of macOS. </p>

  <p id="2kIyaX">I used to hate jigsaw puzzles. I thought they were frustrating, messy, and took way too long to solve. But my wife showed me how those parts of jigsaw puzzles can actually be fun: there’s something satisfying and meditative about working through those frustrations, sorting through the mess, and putting a picture together, one piece at a time, over the course of a few hours. (Or days.)</p>
