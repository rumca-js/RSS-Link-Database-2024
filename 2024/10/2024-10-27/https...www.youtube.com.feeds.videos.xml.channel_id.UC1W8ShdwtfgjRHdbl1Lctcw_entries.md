I colorized with a new technique, restored and created a sound design for this video of Melbourne 1910, Youâ€™ll see iconic locations such as Richmond Train Station, Collins Street, the Town Hall, Elizabeth Street, Little Collins Street, Swanston Street, St Paul's Cathedral, Bourke Street, the Treasury Building, Flinders Street Station, and a glimpse of passionate Collingwood supporters.

Video Restoration Process:
âœ” FPS boosted to 60 frames per second 
âœ” Image resolution boosted up to HD 
âœ” Improved video sharpness and brightness 
âœ” Colorized only for the ambiance (not historically accurate)
âœ”added sound only for the ambiance
âœ”restoration:(stabilisation,denoise,cleand,deblur) 
âœ”Deinterlacing

Please, be aware that colorization colors are not real and fake, colorization was made only for the ambiance and do not represent real historical data.
