<p>MIT researchers have developed a robot training method that reduces time and cost while improving adaptability to new tasks and environments. The approach – called Heterogeneous Pretrained Transformers (HPT) – combines vast amounts of diverse data from multiple sources into a unified system, effectively creating a shared language that generative AI models can process.
