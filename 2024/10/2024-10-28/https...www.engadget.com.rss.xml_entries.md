However, it’s being replaced by a paid, (mostly) offline version called <em>Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp Complete</em>. This refresh <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBwJdX8fnfQ"><ins>drops on December 2</ins></a>, giving mobile Animal Crossing players just a few days without access to their beloved campsites.</p>
<p><em>Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp Complete</em> won’t be cheap. It’ll be $10 from December 2 until January 25. After that, the price doubles to $20. Tom Nook doesn’t mess around. However, it will allow existing players to transfer save data and progress via their Nintendo accounts. This should be a boon for those who have been on board with the title since 2017. T

<p>In a <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://blog.google/products/search/ai-overviews-search-october-2024/">blog post</a> today, Google said it will make AI Overviews in Google Search available to users living in more than 100 countries. Google says people like AI Overviews, so the company plans to reach 1 billion users each month. Additionally, Google is expanding language support — now, users in any country where AI Overviews can get them in any available language. For example users in Japan are no longer limited to Japanese.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you aren’t familiar with AI Overviews by now, it’s a feature found in Google Search. Google’s Gemini AI model will generate a summary for most things people search for, or at least when Google's systems detect a query where generative AI can be useful. This summary appears at the top of the page. Besides answering questions, it can also act as a meal planner, vacation organizer and brainstorming tool, among many other things.</p>

Hugh Nelson, 27, created the images by using photographs of real children, which were then manipulated by AI. Nelson was convicted of 16 child sexual abuse offenses back in August, after a lengthy police investigation. This was the first prosecution of its kind in the UK.</p>
<p>Nelson used modeling software called Daz 3D to manufacture the loathsome images. The program has a suite of AI tools, which he used to transform regular photos of children into CSAM. Greater Manchester police said that he sold these images online and was even commissioned in several cases to create specific items of CSAM via photographs of real kids. Police say that Nelson made around $6,500 by

<p>Last week, the Video Game History Foundation (VGHF) released a <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://gamehistory.org/dmca-2024-statement/"><ins>statement</ins></a> expressing its regret that the US Copyright Office’s refused to grant an exemption to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) to help preserve rare video games. However, the VGHF continued by saying it won’t back down and will continue advocating for improved video game preservation.</p>
<p>For some context, the VGHF had been a longtime supporter of the Software Preservation Network’s (SPN) petition to receive a <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.copyright.gov/1201/2024/comments/Class%206(b)%20-%20Initial%20Comments%20-%20%20Software%20Preservation%20Network%20and%20Library%20Copyright%20Alliance.pdf"><ins>DMCA exemption</ins></a> for the sake of preserving video games, especially for researchers who need access to them and can’t do so due to unavailability.

<p>Imagine going to the doctor, telling them exactly how you&#39;re feeling and then a transcription later adds false information and alters your story. That could be the case in medical centers that use Whisper, OpenAI&#39;s transcription tool. Over a dozen developers, software engineers and academic researchers have found evidence that <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/openai-will-let-developers-build-chatgpt-into-their-apps-204737530.html">Whisper</a> creates hallucinations — invented text — that includes made up medications, racial commentary and violent remarks, <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/researchers-ai-powered-transcription-tool-hospitals-invents-things-115170291"><em>ABC News </em>reports</a>.

<p>If you’ve used Cash App in the last six years, you might be entitled to compensation as part of a class-action settlement. <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/cash-app-users-can-claim-thousands-of-dollars-in-a-data-breach-settlement-194520756.html"><ins>The company set up a $15 million fund after breaches enabled a trove of user personal data to leak</ins></a>. You can file a claim through a dedicated settlement website, and depending on what you can prove, you could receive up to $2,500.
