Water and oil, and some other simple fluids, respond in the same way to all levels of shear stress. These are termed Newtonian fluids, and their viscosity is constant for all stresses although it will vary with temperature. Under different stresses and pressure gradients, other non-Newtonian fluids exhibit patterns of behavior that are much more complex.

Climate models are critical for anticipating future changes caused by greenhouse gas emissions, helping guide policy decisions on climate mitigation. However, some of the latest climate models—particularly a set from the newest generation—have been deemed "too hot," meaning they predict warming in excess of realistic estimates. This can lead to exaggerated expectations of environmental impacts, such as permafrost loss.

When plumes of magma well up through Earth's lithosphere, they create volcanoes, islands, seamounts, and other features on the surface. Telltale hot spot tracks form as tectonic plates move over these plumes, marking plume locations and the movement of the crust above them through time.

The dingo was completely isolated from other canines on the Australian mainland for more than 5,000 years, until domestic dogs arrived on the scene. Subsequent concerns about livestock loss formed the basis of Australia's "wild dog" (dingo) pest control programs, which continue today. Stretching 5,614km across Australia, the "dingo fence" or "dog fence" was built in the 1880s to keep dingoes away from livestock in the southeast.

It can be difficult to tell someone what you think of their work, even if you mean well and even if you think they're doing a good job. Sometimes the person doesn't understand what you mean, or doesn't respond the way you'd hoped. Feedback should contribute to learning, but you might sometimes wonder if it's any use at all. South African university lecturer Martina van Heerden studied the art of giving feedback to students in higher education. Her insights and three top tips are useful for effective communication in many areas of life.

Carbon dioxide (CO₂) is naturally removed from the air when it reacts with certain types of rock. We can accelerate this process by crushing suitable rocks and spreading them over agricultural fields. This simple method, known as "enhanced rock weathering," could vastly increase the rate of CO₂ removal from the atmosphere.

EVs contain invaluable information, such as proteins and genetic material, from their original cell, which can provide insight about the status of the body. Scientists have been trying to leverage EVs for their diagnostic and therapeutic potential but have struggled to do so in a fast and cost-effective way.

Synthetic polymers are an alternative to conventional storage media because they maintain stored information while using less space and energy. However, data retrieval by mass spectrometry limits the length and thus the storage capacity of individual polymer chains.
