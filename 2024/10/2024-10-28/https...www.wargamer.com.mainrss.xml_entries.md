								<p>With its simple rules, take-that player interaction, and strong theming, Gay Sauna would fall into the ‘family <strong>board game</strong>’ category were it not for the 18+ age recommendation on the box. That comes 100% from the theme: in Gay Sauna, each player is a patron at a wet and wild gay cruising spot, competing with their buddies to land the most hookups before the lights come on and the night ends.</p>

								<p><strong>Magic: The Gathering</strong>’s announcement of Standard legal crossover sets last Friday went down like a lead balloon with a portion of the game’s fanbase. These are dramatic changes: Wizards of the Coast is not only putting Universes Beyond tie-ins into every Magic format, it’s also creating more crossovers. The company plans to move to a half and half model where 50% of its sets follow its own original IP and 50% are collaborations with other franchises.</p>
