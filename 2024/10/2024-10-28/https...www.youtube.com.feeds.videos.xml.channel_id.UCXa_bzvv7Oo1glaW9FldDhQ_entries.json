Not only is it a worthy follow up to the original game that returning fans will find plenty to love about, but it also stands on its own two feet with a gripping story and an excellent cast of well-written and excellently performed characters. \n\nThe writing stumbles at times and it\u2019s got some technical rough edges, but by and large, Life is Strange: Double Exposure is definitely worth your time, especially if you\u2019re a series fan.", "id": 1403550, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCLfZ1Zl3Oc", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 129, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/DCLfZ1Zl3Oc/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Life Is Strange: Double Exposure Review - The Final Verdict", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-10-28T17:00:12+00:00", "description": "The end of the year is approaching, and it's about time that publications begin crowning their Games of the Year.

The former improves on its predecessor with a Career System, flight planner, and even more real-world systems.
