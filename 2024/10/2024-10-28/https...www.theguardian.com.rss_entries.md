<p>From Front Row Joes wanting control to the leader of the Proud Boys wanting to ‘make America hate again’, this documentary interviews Trump fans – and takes more time than most films to show why his popularity runs so deep</p><p>Documentaries about the phenomenon of Donald Trump are often overcome by the sheer horror of the man, what he has done and – especially among those broadcast in the runup to the 2024 US election – what he may be planning to do in the future. Sometimes, however, they sidestep this trap and treat the subject itself with the sober consideration that it, rather than the man, deserves.</p><p>Into the latter category falls Trump: A Second Chance? which, like all the best documentaries, ploughs the harder furrow. Here, Maga supporters are not treated as one undifferentiated “basket of deplorables” but interviewed – at length, in the case of Trump superfan Rich Frazier – as individuals representing separate strands of Trump’s base.

<p>The US meeting’s vainglorious claim to be racing’s ‘World Championships’ is edging a little closer to reality</p><p>The news that Frankie Dettori will replace Kieren Shoemark on Emily Upjohn in the Breeders’ Cup Turf at Del Mar was undoubtedly a disappointment for John Gosden’s stable jockey, but it also put the finishing touch to what promises to be an all-star cast in California this weekend.</p><p>The only surprise about Gosden’s move, perhaps, is that anyone was surprised. It is hardly the first time that the trainer has turned to Dettori and his wealth of experience at US racing’s showpiece meeting, most memorably when the Italian replaced Jimmy Fortune aboard Raven’s Pass in the 2008 Classic and delivered the only success to date for a British yard in the Breeders’ Cup’s showpiece event.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/28/talking-horses-breeders-cup-frankie-dettori-all-star-cast-horse-racing-tips">Continue reading...</a>

It’s also a welcome excuse for the cities of New York and Los Angeles to talk about themselves, a special little treat that neither municipality takes for granted.</p><p>There’s nothing New Yorkers and Angelenos love more than a bit of civic onanism. “You gotta try our bagels,” you might hear walking the garbage-laden streets of Manhattan. “Strip mall sushi” is something those of us blessed to live in Los Angeles are legally obligated to say to anyone asking for a recommendation of any kind. For those who haven’t had this screamed at them at the Delta terminal at LAX, this means the best sushi restaurants are in strip malls.

<p>Next year’s ban in England and Wales will put an end to one of the most embarrassingly era-defining trends of the early 2020s</p><p>There’s a certain combination of hedonism and delusion that the disposable vape smoker knows well. You don’t vape, not really, and you could quit anytime you’d like. You’re only vaping because it’s a fun little indulgence, a treat. You tell yourself this while heading to the shop to buy one more, mentally noting: “This will be the last.” But as soon as the vape is drained, you’re back again.</p><p>I loved being trapped in this cycle of self-deception. On the outside, it may have seemed like I was trapped, but inside, there was freedom in setting aside all my other obsessions and psychological compulsions to focus solely on my next hit. Better yet, this craving was so socially acceptable that I could satisfy it anywhere, anytime. I quickly reached a point of going through at least one disposable vape a day. For someone who’s never had a vape phase, tha

He explains how he went from the dole to the big time</p><p>In 2009, David Wrench was close to giving it all up. He was working as an engineer in a recording studio in north Wales but wasn’t getting enough work and was struggling to pay the rent each month. An offer to do some lecturing came in and he thought: why not? When he ran this past his friend and collaborator, Julian Cope, he got a sharp response. “He said to me: ‘Go and look in the mirror,’” says Wrench. “‘You’re unemployable in the real world. Find a way to make this work because you won’t last five minutes, you’ll go completely crazy.’ Annoyingly, I knew he was right.”</p><p>Wrench didn’t have to wait long for his fortunes to change. In 2010, Odessa, a track he had mixed for Caribou, was released and became a global anthem. “That opened up a whole different world,” he says. He soon found

So when the elderly lady who lived opposite us told us that her dog, Flossie, an orange and white border collie cross, was pregnant as a result of what was described as a “street accident”, my then husband, two young sons and I said that the puppy might just be the pet we were looking for.</p><p>And so it proved. We all fell immediately for Flossie’s pup – she was an adorable little creature. But what were we going to call her? At that time, Shirley Williams, then the education secretary, had unveiled a plan to close down the small college of education in Scarborough where my husband was a lecturer. I no longer remember if it was he or I who sugges

<p>Both savoury and sweet, it’s reminiscent of rice pudding, bread sauce, Sunday roast stuffing and cheesy risotto</p><p>In her 1845 book <a href="https://prospectbooks.co.uk/products-page/historic-recipes-ingredients/historic-cookbooks/modern-cookery-for-private-families/">Modern Cookery for Private Families,</a> Eliza Acton has six recipes for chestnuts: a soup, a stuffing, a stew, with sausages, as part of a wonderful-sounding custard, and also boiled, noting that some chestnuts <em>“</em>require to be boiled nearly or quite an hour, others little more than half the time: the cook should try them occasionally”<em>.</em> Once they are soft, she suggests draining, wiping with a coarse cloth and sending them to the table quickly in a hot napkin. This makes me think of another table, and of a man so frustrated by the stubborn, leathery skin of a boiled chestnut that it pinged out of his hand and hit another man just below his eye.

Memory must be erased. “This demands a continuous alteration of the past, made possible by the system of thought which really embraces all the rest, and which is known in Newspeak as doublethink.” The past, like the facts, must be reinvented. “For when it has been recreated in whatever shape is needed at the moment, then this new version is the past, and no different past can ever have existed.”</p><p>Donald Trump keeps saying that if he elected to a second term he will prosecute his political opponents, “the enemies within”.

<p>Eastern regions such as Valencia and Catalonia could get seven times the typical monthly rainfall on Tuesday</p><p>Spain is set to experience an extraordinary weather event this week, with severe rainfall forecasted, particularly along the eastern coast. Regions such as Valencia, Catalonia, Murcia, and eastern Andalucía could get more than 150mm of rain within just 24 hours on Tuesday, which is more than seven times the typical average for this month. Gibraltar is also expected to experience significant rainfall, with totals exceeding 40mm.</p><p>The intense downpour is likely due to a phenomenon known as a gota fría, or “cold drop”, which occurs when cold air moves over the warm waters of the Mediterranean Sea. This seasonal occurrence creates atmospheric instability, causing warm, saturated air to rise rapidly, leading to the formation of towering cumulonimbus clouds in a matter of hours, dumping heavy rain across eastern parts of Spain.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/

<p>West Ham’s Aaron Wan-Bissaka shines against former club, Alex Iwobi has gone up a level and Brentford find new hero</p><p>Aaron Wan-Bissaka looked as if he had a point to prove against Manchester United. The right-back has had an intriguing role for West Ham this season. Julen Lopetegui has spotted hidden creative tendencies in the defender and given him freedom to attack. Wan-Bissaka has inverted and he was irrepressible against United. Noussair Mazraoui, his replacement at United, could not contain the former Crystal Palace player. Wan-Bissaka kept running clear and delivering crosses, and he should have had an assist when his ball reached Emerson Palmieri, who scuffed wide. If there is a concern, though, it is that Wan-Bissaka’s positioning does make West Ham open. Alejandro Garnacho had a lot of space and did not make enough of it. United were ridiculously frustrating in front of goal. A better team would have punished West Ham during the first half. They got the win, though,
