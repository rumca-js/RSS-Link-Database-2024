Given how special the original Life is Strange to so many people, it was easy to understand why there were many who were skeptical about the series deciding to go back to protagonist Max Caulfield- but Life is Strange: Double Exposure is no cynical nostalgia-bating cash grab. 

No, this is a truly excellent new Life is Strange story. Not only is it a worthy follow up to the original game that returning fans will find plenty to love about, but it also stands on its own two feet with a gripping story and an excellent cast of well-written and excellently performed characters. 

The writing stumbles at times and it’s got some technical rough edges, but by and large, Life is Strange: Double Exposure is definitely worth your time, especially if you’re a series fan.

The end of the year is approaching, and it's about time that publications begin crowning their Games of the Year. Before that, November has its share of big releases, from the eagerly awaited to the long-in-development.

The biggest games of the month are probably Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 and S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl. The former improves on its predecessor with a Career System, flight planner, and even more real-world systems. Meanwhile, the latter takes the survival sandbox approach of the franchise and offers a massive seamless map with an extensive story and tons of secrets.

If you don't have an Xbox Series X/S (or the hardware to run them on PC), don't worry. Whether it's Planet Coaster 2 and the addition of water attractions, the early access launches of Path of Exile 2 and Towers of Aghasba, or the first new Mario and Luigi title since 2015, there's plenty more to look forward to in November.

In our excitement, we’ve already spoken about the highly anticipated upcoming action RPG, but there’s still plenty left to talk about, so here, we’re going to go over a few more key details that you should know about the game.

The big question is whether the latest title, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, has something new to showcase. The answer is somewhat mixed, between the campaign that adheres to tropes as aged as the sub-series and multiplayer with new age movement that's not necessarily mandatory. 

Nevertheless, the former delivers a cliched and predictable story. Multiplayer is perhaps the weakest element due to its underwhelming maps and other issues.
