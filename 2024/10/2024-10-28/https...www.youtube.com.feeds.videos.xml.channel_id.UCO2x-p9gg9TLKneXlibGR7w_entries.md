In this video, we transform a cluttered desk setup into a clean, organized, and aesthetic workspace using next-level 3D printing for cable management—and with 3D printing now cheaper than ever, it's a no-brainer. Forget Velcro, zip ties, and those overpriced off-the-shelf cable management kits that feel like a scam; with a modular pegboard system, managing cables for devices like Apple's Mac Studio, HomePods, and Studio Displays has never been easier. From designing custom cable channels to perfectly arranging power strips, this video dives into innovative 3D printing solutions for a clutter-free desk setup that's easy to update or expand.
