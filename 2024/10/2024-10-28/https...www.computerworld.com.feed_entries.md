<p>The Phoenix fabrication facility of the world’s largest semiconductor chip maker is yielding more usable chips than similar plants in Taiwan, <a href="https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2024/10/26/2003825883" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to the <em>Taipei Times</em></a>.</p>



<p>Rick Cassidy, president of TSMC’s US division, said during a webinar last week that the share of usable chips from the company’s Phoenix plant exceeds that of similar Taiwanese plants by 4%. If true, the superior performance at the Phoenix fab is notable because the US government has been working to spur a return of the semiconductor manufacturing industry to US shores, where manufa

<p>Apple’s week of Mac began today with a newly announced iMac, now beefed up with an M4 chip and more internal memory. Apple says the iMac is up to 4.5 times faster than an equivalent all-in-one Intel Core 7 Windows PC — and promises the machine will deliver up to six times the performance of the most popular Intel-based iMac.</p>



<p>The inference is obvious: if you use your iMac professionally, you might want to think about an upgrade. Reinforcing the point, Apple says the iMac is up to 1.7 times faster for most tasks and 2.1 times faster for more advanced tasks when compared to the M1 model.</p>

<p>Workspace is Google’s suite of productivity software tools, the main competitor to market leader Microsoft 365 (formerly Office 365). Formerly known as G Suite, Google Workspace includes well-known apps such as Gmail, Docs, Sheets, and Slides — apps that are also used for free by billions of people globally.</p>



<p>Google has been selling productivity apps to businesses for almost two decades now, having helped pave the way for cloud-based office productivity apps in the 2000s. At a time when most office suites were based on installed desktop software and sold as one-time purchases, Google bundled its popular free web apps with various business services to create a cloud-based office softwar
