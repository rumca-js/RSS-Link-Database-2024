Today on the Matt Walsh Show, today is the day that my film “Am I Racist?” is finally available to watch at home on DailyWire+. It couldn't hit streaming at a better time. I'll explain why. Also, Donald Trump had a huge weekend. First was his marathon interview with Joe Rogan, and then his massive rally at Madison Square Garden. The Democrats are getting very nervous–and they should be. Kamala's campaign tried to counterprogram by falsely advertising a Beyoncé performance that never happened and then having Tim Walz livestream on Twitch. Meanwhile, Michelle Obama gives a shockingly angry and bitter speech, hoping to convince men to vote by berating them. I don't think it will work.
