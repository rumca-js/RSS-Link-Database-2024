<p>Microsoft has been rolling out Windows 11 24H2 for some time now, which has caused numerous problems — some so serious, in fact, that Microsoft has started <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2502748/windows-11-might-not-update-if-you-have-the-wrong-hardware-or-apps.html">blocking the update for affected systems</a>.</p>



<p>A few days ago, on October 24, the company released the <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/october-24-2024-kb5044384-os-build-26100-2161-preview-5a4ac390-7c7b-4f7f-81c2-c2b329ac86ab">optional KB5044384 patch</a> for Windows 11, which was intended to fix many of the problems. But as <a href="https://www.windowslatest.com/2024/10/27/windows-11-24h2-kb5044384-install-fails-task-manager-reporting-issue-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Windows Latest reports</a>, this rescue update is itself causi

<p>Microsoft is redesigning its Teams chat interface — in a way that mimics the organization of, say, PCWorld’s home page.</p>



<p>Microsoft said Monday that it will begin testing a new Teams interface in November, optionally collapsing various channels, teams, and chat options into a single feed. Customers with access to the Teams public preview will be able to try out this new interface next month, Microsoft <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2024/10/28/streamline-collaboration-with-the-new-chat-and-channels-experience-in-microsoft-teams/">said</a> today.</p>



<p>On the surface, the new chat interface appears similar to how PCWorld organizes our latest articles. What we call a “crawl” of articles progresses down the PCWorld home page, mixing in news, tips, how-tos, reviews, and more. If you want to see reviews and only reviews,

<p>It’s hard to find a gaming laptop if you’re on a budget, but we’ve seen Lenovo’s more affordable LOQ series — and specifically this 15-inch model — come to the rescue several times.</p>



<p>Today, Best Buy is offering <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/lenovo-loq-15-6-gaming-laptop-fhd-amd-ryzen-7-7435hs-with-16gb-memory-nvidia-geforce-rtx-4060-8gb-512gb-ssd-luna-grey/6578511.p?skuId=6578511">this version with a Ryzen CPU and an RTX 4060 graphics card for $750</a>. That’s $250 off the retail price.</p>



<p>With an 8-core Ryzen 7 7435HS processor, a generous 16GB of DDR5 RAM, and 512GB of SSD space, the Lenovo LOQ 15 is ready to tackle pretty much anything a regular user (or college student) could throw at it.</p>



<p>But it’s also packing an RTX 4060 graphics card with 8GB of video memory. That’s more than enough juice to get through most competi

<p>A bug that borks your PC on a new Windows update is a familiar headache for many of us. It’s gotten less frequent in the last few years thanks to Microsoft being a little more proactive, as Windows will now <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2495860/microsoft-blocks-windows-11-24h2-update-on-devices-with-known-issues.html">scan your hardware and installed software for potential incompatibilities</a> before it updates, then halt said update if it sees a problem.</p>



<p>But with the growing number of issues affecting the Windows 11 24H2 update, we’re seeing a surprising expansion in the breadth of these upgrade blocks. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/windows-11-24h2-the-hardware-and-software-blocking-the-new-update/">BleepingComputer has an excellent rundown</a> of exactly what hardware and software might keep your system f

<p>Google has big plans for AI, and that’s no secret. But specifically what it plans to do with AI in the near future — and how it hopes consumers will interact with it — is a little more hazy.</p>



<p>According to a new report, the next major revision of the Gemini model has some grand ambitions, including the ability to completely control the Chrome browser. That’s <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/google-is-developing-ai-to-take-over-computers">according to The Information</a>, citing unconfirmed leaks from deep within Google.</p>



<p>The system is allegedly codenamed “Project Jarvis,” a clear allusion to Tony Stark’s fictional and semi-sentient artificial intelligence from the <em>Iron Man</em> movies. This upgraded version of Gemini can apparently control Google’s Chrome browser with screenshots and virtualized mouse clicks, similar

<p>If you’ve been eagerly waiting to know more about the highly anticipated, gaming-focused variant of the Ryzen 9000 CPU series, then the recent 9800X3D leaks are likely good news for you.</p>



<p>AMD already confirmed that it was going to announce Ryzen 9000X3D chip variants <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/amd-ryzen-7-9800x3d-cinebench-r23-leak-shows-all-core-frequency-of-5-6-ghz-with-pbo-enabled">on November 7</a>, but there won’t be much mystery left when that date finally rolls around. One model in particular was spotted pretty much everywhere this weekend: the Ryzen 7 9800X3D.</p>



<p>The 9800X3D is probably the most anticipated chip in the upcoming series, as the last-gen 7800X3D is one of the most popular CPUs around for its mix of punchy performance and (relatively) affordable price.</p>

<p>Know what your PC gaming setup needs? After equipping a powerful RTX graphics card, you’re going to need a super-speedy monitor that can show those uber-high frame rates at intended.</p>



<p>And wouldn’t you know it, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-XG259CMS-Compatible-DisplayWidget-warranty/dp/B0CV22HQR3/">this 24.5-inch Asus ROG Strix gaming monitor that ticks all the boxes is on sale for $229 on Amazon</a>! That’s $70 (or 23 percent) off its original $299 price.</p>



<p>So, what makes this monitor stand out? It’s clearly not the size because this isn’t anywhere close to a gigantic screen that takes over your desk. It’s also not a 4K monitor, putting out a 1080p resolution instead.</p>



<p>But the selling point here is its 310Hz refresh rate. That’s bonkers fast, blowing past other monitors in this price range that only offer 120Hz, 144Hz, or

<p><br><br>Robot vacuums have become indispensable in our homes. From pet hair to daily dust, these devices keep floors clean with minimal hands-on help. But like any tool, a robot vacuum needs regular upkeep to keep running at peak performance—and to avoid early retirement. </p>



<p>Fortunately, the steps to extending your vacuum’s lifespan are simple, and many are directly recommended by manufacturers. Here’s what you need to know to get the most out of your robo-cleaner.</p>

<p>The majority of U.S. homes have an internet connection, and it’s probably not a stretch to guess that the proportion that also has Wi-Fi is close to 100 percent. Anyone who lives in a populated area and opened the Wi-Fi settings on their mobile phone will have seen how there are many networks competing for space in the ether.</p>



<p>Modern routers, especially mesh routers, have thankfully made problems with poor Wi-Fi coverage fairly rare, but there are still many good reasons to review your network. It’s not just about security, but also about getting the most out of your internet connection, minimizing lag in online games and protecting your and your family’s privacy.</p>
