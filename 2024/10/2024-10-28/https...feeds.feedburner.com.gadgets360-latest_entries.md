Analysis of a 17,000-year-old infant’s remains from southern Italy sheds light on Ice Age ancestry and health. The infant, found in a Puglian cave, was likely around a year old at death and had distinctive traits—brown skin, blue eyes, and curly dark hair. His genome links him to Europe’s Villabruna lineage, suggesting their presence in southern Europe well before the Ice Age’s end. Genetic analysis also revealed a rare heart condition, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, as a likely cause of death. These findings provide unique insight into Ice Age life and genetic traits.

A new study led by David Ho highlights that rainfall significantly increases the ocean's carbon dioxide absorption by 5% to 7%, adding up to 140 to 190 million metric tons of CO2 annually. This research identifies mechanisms like turbulence, dilution, and wet deposition as key contributors to enhanced carbon uptake. The findings are crucial for improving climate models, especially as rainfall patterns are expected to change with climate change.

Researchers at The Jackson Laboratory, Broad Institute, and Yale University use AI to identify DNA sequences that control gene activation in specific cells. This AI model decodes patterns in DNA regions called cis-regulatory elements (CREs), guiding synthetic DNA switches for cell-specific gene activity. Early testing in animal models showed success in selective gene expression, promising future gene therapies with precise targeting, like liver cells in zebrafish, without affecting other tissues. This method may lead to specialized treatments for genetic conditions, helping advance gene editing and cell-specific therapies.

Astronomers has revealed a rare triple system in the Milky Way consisting of a black hole and two stars, known as V404 Cygni. Located approximately 8,000 light-years away, this system poses new questions about black hole formation, suggesting that they may arise through a less violent "direct collapse" process rather than the expected explosive events. Confirmed by the Gaia space telescope, this finding offers significant insights into the origins of black holes and the complexities of stellar interactions.

## Study Warns Melting Arctic Ice Could Disrupt Ocean Currents in Europe

Scientists from UiT The Arctic University of Norway have issued a stark warning regarding the impact of melting Arctic sea ice on global ocean circulation patterns. Their recent study highlights that significant inflows of freshwater from melting sea ice into the Nordic Seas have historically led to dramatic cooling in northern Europe. By analysing sediment cores, the researchers found that past periods of Arctic warming resulted in disruptions to ocean currents and temperature distribution. As the Arctic is projected to experience ice-free summers by 2050, these findings raise critical concerns about the future of global weather patterns. In an open letter, numerous climate scientists expressed alarm over the increasing risk of major changes in ocean circulation in the Atlantic, emphasising the potential for devastating and irreversible consequences. This research underscores the delicate balance of the Earth's climate system and the urgent need for further study into these dynamics.
