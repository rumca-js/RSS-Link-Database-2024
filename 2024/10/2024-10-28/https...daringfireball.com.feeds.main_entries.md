<p>Nice rundown of the first wave of Apple Intelligence features from Apple Newsroom. As <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/10/22/stern-federighi-apple-intelligence">I wrote last week</a>, my favorite thus far are the notification summaries. The key is not to think of them as a replacement for actually reading the messages — they just serve the same purpose as a well-written Subject line in an email. They just answer — usually quite well — “What’s this stack of notifications about?”</p>
