Actually this game has nothing to do with Risk. It is a remake of old epic game Star Wars: The Queen&#39;s Gambit. Not as large-scale or beautiful as Gambit, but much cheaper and more affordable.</p> <p>This is an asymmetric duel game: Empire and Rebels are fighting simultaneously on several fronts. Core of gameplay is hand management: each round you choose 3 action cards from 6 cards in your hand, choose one of 1-3 action options on each of them (for example, you can activate Darth Vader, or TIE fighters, or X-wings, or move further to the shield generator or, on the contrary, strengthen its defenses), then action cards get played alternately (Rebels go first, then Empire, repeat twice) are played in chosen order. Combat is simple dice-based, nothing special.</p> <p>The

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I did a search of the subreddit and I couldn’t find any mentions of this game.

You pick 5 at random and keep them hidden in consecutive order. Then from a selection of question cards you have to choose suitable questions to attempt to figure out the opponent’s cards and color.</p> <p>It takes good deduction skills and thinking to work out the opponents cards before they work out your own and I strongly recommend it to anyone who appreciates these kinds of games.</p> <p>I have been playing it with my wife and her family for a while and it’s great.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SgtClunge"> /u/SgtClunge </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1gdst9t/excellent_quick_24_player_game_i_found_in_j

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Any suggestions for a murder mystery company? My group have done a good amount of them and we like when the story line is strong and there&#39;s good background for a character. We are fine with improving, but like some guidance. We did a Night of Mystery last year, which was okay but want to see if there&#39;s another that fits us better!</p> <p>Any insights would be great!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SadDeal640"> /u/SadDeal640 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1gdq885/murder_mystery_dinner_help/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1gdq885/murder_mystery_dinner_help/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi, I may host a game next month and must start learning the rules. Someone on another thread said that the new rules manual from Fear of the Unknown is easier to follow. True?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have only got to play this a handful of times (mostly because players didn&#39;t like lack of terrain/very few enemies/bosses for customisation) but on the times I did get to I noticed that V&#39;s contribution is very lacking when compared to everyone else. He has the same interrupt and score double points cards as everyone else making gaining points no different but he barely has any board presence. I&#39;ve tried to play optimally but that resulted in no more than 3 kills a turn and kiting/force other players to soak damage on enemies I couldn&#39;t kill due to his passive debuff.</p> <p>Each character fits the theme of the dmc5 but tying the kill ability to a card that is already hard to combo due to the colours, needing to spend extra resources for movement just to get said kill (that others could easily do without debuff) and making sure I haven&#39;t overextended throughout all this for the remaining enemies makes me think V is a thematic ch
