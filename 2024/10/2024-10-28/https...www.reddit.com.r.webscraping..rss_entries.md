<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi folks. I just wanted to share an open source project I built and maintain: a Google News Scraper written in TypeScript: <a href="https://github.com/lewisdonovan/google-news-scraper">https://github.com/lewisdonovan/google-news-scraper</a>. I&#39;ve seen a lot of Python scrapers for Google News on here but none that work for Node so thought I would share. </p> <p>I respond quickly to tickets, and there&#39;s already a pretty active community that also help each other out, but the scraper itself is stable anyway. Would love to get the community&#39;s feedback, and hopefully this helps someone. </p> <p>Cheers!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/lewiscodes"> /u/lewiscodes </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1gdwxv9/open_source_google_news_scraper_in_typescript/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1gdwxv9/open_source_
