The Coen Brothers are some of the most prolific directors to ever step behind a camera.  With timeless classics like The Big Lebowski, Fargo, Raising Arizona, and No Country for Old Men, their library of films are beloved by generations.  But when the Coen Brothers decided to take a break for their solo efforts, something felt off.  Both of the Coen Brothers films The Tragedy of Macbeth and Drive Away Dolls failed to resonate with audiences like their past works.  Which proves that the Coen Brothers each bring something to the table that turns their scripts into masterpieces.   Joel and Ethan Coen need each other, and hopefully they will reunite soon.
