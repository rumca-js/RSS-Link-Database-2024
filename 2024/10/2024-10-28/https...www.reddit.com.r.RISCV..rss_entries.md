<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have to make a project to satisfy my masters degree requirement. I will be putting this project on my resume and I want this project to be an eye catcher for recruiters. I have also seen a lot of people with RISC V processor using verilog in their resume but I want to make something which has RISC V and also an addon or updated version with it. Can Ya&#39;ll suggest some good ideas for the projects which doesnt seem common and consists of current trends? TIA. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Magnum_Axe"> /u/Magnum_Axe </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1geg6km/masters_project_ideas_with_risc_v/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1geg6km/masters_project_ideas_with_risc_v/">[comments]</a></span>

## mruby on the Milk-V Duo

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone,</p> <p>If anyone here is a Ruby fan, I got mruby running on the Milk-V Duo series of boards, and wrote a gem: <a href="https://github.com/denko-rb/mruby-milkv-duo">mruby-milkv-duo</a> to provide GPIO, ADC, PWM, I2C and SPI access in mruby.</p> <p>In the releases section of my repo, you&#39;ll find pre-built binaries for the Duo, Duo 256M and Duo S. Just copy the appropriate binary to your board and run scripts like <code>mruby filename.rb</code>. The binaries include mruby itself, all its standard gems (libraries), and my GPIO gem. Check the <code>examples</code> folder of the repo to see what&#39;s possible.</p> <p>The GPIO gem is limited to a fairly low-level interface, and that&#39;s intentional. I have another gem where I write peripheral drivers, in CRuby, for other platforms with a similar interface. The eventual plan is to make that cross-compatible across CRuby and mruby, so those drivers become usable on the Milk-V too.</p> </di
