It was just him on a summery beat and an acoustic guitar; at the Tiny Desk, the sweetness of \u201cMillions\u201d blooms.\n\nBefore his first headlining tour, the Toronto-based R&B artist stopped by the NPR Music office to share material from his latest project, Dreamt that I Was, and three older songs reimagined for this performance. The choices reflect his growth as an artist: His new music still showcases his soft vocals, but holds more dimension with the addition of saxophone and piano.\n\nAs the band settled in, it was clear to see how important this moment was for each of them. Sylo acknowledged this at the end of the set: \u201cThis last song is a testament and a reminder to how far this journey as an artist has taken me. It\u2019s had its ups and downs, but I honestly wouldn\u2019t have it any other way because it led me to where I stand today.\"\n\nSET LIST\n\u201cFOMO\u201d\n\u201cFall Into Me\u201d\n\u201cSo Familiar\u201d\n", "id": 1399974, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57H4UBO6B5k", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 225, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/57H4UBO6B5k/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Sylo: Tiny Desk Concert", "vote": 0}]
