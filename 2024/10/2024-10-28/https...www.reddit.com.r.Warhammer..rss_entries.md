## A Games Workshop Memory: How My Dwarf Slayer Lord almost won me a free 2k point army

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I wish I could remember all the details, but in the early 2000’s (7th edition) GW had a contest where you needed one Fantasy model (unmounted) to run a gauntlet of I believe greater demons. They were spaced out one by one at first then in a group of two, three then four. This was not the era of Uber powerful lords that took up half the army’s points. </p> <p>The rules were that you always got the charge, but they would swing back if you didn’t kill them all. And if you run the gauntlet(basically impossible) you’d win a <strong>free 2k point army</strong>. </p> <p>I had a burgeoning dwarf army at the time. And I realized that with the correct selection of runes on his weapon, a dwarf daemon slayer lord would be literally perfect for the challenge. There are some specialized runes and rules that allowed him to just be a little wrecking ball against these demons specifically. I have long since lost my book, but to my recollection he was wounding on 2+,
