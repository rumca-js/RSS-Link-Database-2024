Desperate reports have been sent from a number of Chinese citizens arrested by Chinese police stationed in Panama this month. More than 100 Chinese citizens were allegedly detained in a camp under harsh conditions, and then repatriated back to China by force, or forced to pay thousands of dollars to be bailed out. 

With record numbers of Chinese immigrants coming through Panama to enter the US southern border over the past two years, why would Chinese police try to stop them now?
