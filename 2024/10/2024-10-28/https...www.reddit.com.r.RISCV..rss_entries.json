I will be putting this project on my resume and I want this project to be an eye catcher for recruiters. I have also seen a lot of people with RISC V processor using verilog in their resume but I want to make something which has RISC V and also an addon or updated version with it. Can Ya&#39;ll suggest some good ideas for the projects which doesnt seem common and consists of current trends?

Just copy the appropriate binary to your board and run scripts like <code>mruby filename.rb</code>. The binaries include mruby itself, all its standard gems (libraries), and my GPIO gem. Check the <code>examples</code> folder of the repo to see what&#39;s possible.</p> <p>The GPIO gem is limited to a fairly low-level interface, and that&#39;s intentional. I have another gem where I write peripheral drivers, in CRuby, for other platforms with a similar interface. The eventual plan is to make that cross-compatible across CRuby and mruby, so those drivers become usable on the Milk-V too.</p> </di", "id": 1402838, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1ge76j2/mruby_on_the_milkv_duo", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 471, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "mruby on the Milk-V Duo", "vote": 0}]
