<p>The Open Source Initiative (OSI) on Monday released the result of a year-long global community initiative to create a standard defining what, exactly, constitutes an open source artificial intelligence (AI) system.</p>



<p>The Open Source AI Definition (OSAID) v1.0, unveiled at the All Things Open 2024 conference in Raleigh, North Carolina, is described as “the first stable version” of a project to establish a set of principles that “that can recreate permissionless, pragmatic, and simplified collaboration for AI practitioners, similar to that which the <a href="https://opensource.org/osd">Open Source Definition</a> has done for the software ecosystem,” the OSI said in its <a href="https://ha

<p>In the current technology landscape, organizations are looking to AI to provide transformative product differentiation and groundbreaking new revenue streams. In 2023, <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3709489/large-language-models-the-foundations-of-generative-ai.html">large language models</a> (LLMs) dazzled folks with the possibility of new capabilities, features, and products. In 2024 and beyond, we’re now focused on the reality of bringing those ideas to fruition and the challenges of what that means for data infrastructure. For most, the road to AI success is not smooth, as organizations find their legacy data ecosystem will not suffice for data processing today, let alone tomorr

<p>Oh, for the days when “open source” was simply the business-friendly version of “free software.” When we could make believe that the Open Source Definition (OSD) crafted for a world of packaged software shipped on CDs or other physical media would apply equally well to AI or cloud. When the categories of “us” and “them” were clear, and “them” always meant the bad guys.</p>



<p>Wasn’t 2023 awesome?</p>



<p>Of course, open source has always been much more complicated than some would like to suppose. But this week that complexity exploded, revealing a roiling mess of geopolitics, chip wars and, of course, AI messiness. Rather than a testament to the inherent weakness of facile understanding of

<p>In my comparisons of <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2252269/review-the-10-best-javascript-editors.html">JavaScript editors</a> and <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2261335/review-the-6-best-javascript-ides.html">JavaScript IDEs</a>, my top recommendations often include Sublime Text (as an editor) and <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3666488/what-is-visual-studio-code-microsofts-extensible-code-editor.html">Visual Studio Code</a> (as either an editor or an IDE). Neither is restricted to JavaScript, or even JavaScript plus HTML and CSS. If you step back and look at the bigger picture, Sublime Text and Visual Studio Code are two of the best multi-language, multi-OS
