In this video, I code a realtime web app with TypeScript that I think y'all will really enjoy playing (and watching the build process). It's a live, weekly developer trivia game. Test your coding knowledge and compete with fellow developers! Every Wednesday at 12pm ET, join us for 10 rounds of brain-teasing questions covering everything from programming languages to computer science fundamentals. Climb the leaderboard, learn something new, and have fun with the dev community!
