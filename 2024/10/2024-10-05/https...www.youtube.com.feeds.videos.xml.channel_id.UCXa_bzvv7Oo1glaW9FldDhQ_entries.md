Many have questioned whether Sony and Ballistic Moon’s Until Dawn remake even needs to exist at all, while its $60 pricing has also been an egregious point for many, and though it’s hard not to see the validity of those criticisms, viewed on its own merits, the remake deserves plenty of credit. 

Ballistic Moon has rebuilt the game from the ground up using Unreal Engine 5, and though this is largely a very faithful remake, with its visual and technical enhancements, as well as the sum total of the small changes and additions it makes here and there, this new version of Until Dawn is a decidedly solid enhancement of a game that hasn’t lost any of its slasher horror charms.
