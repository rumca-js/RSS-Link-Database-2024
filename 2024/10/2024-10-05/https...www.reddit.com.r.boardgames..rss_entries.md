I hear Ankh is good at two but I’m thinking personally for two, I’d rather play something quick and light like Unmatched.

I own Root all-in but I’m pretty intent on keeping that. I didn’t love the drafting of Blood Rage because it seemed to rely on knowing the three pools of cards well, but my play of Inis seemed better because the draft pool is small, but overall still on the fence.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Last week, I spent several days in the hospital taking care of my father-in-law during his surgery. Since I’m not much into OTT or video streaming, I had a lot of downtime and found myself staring out the window. That’s when a game idea hit me.</p> <p>The next day, I brought my laptop and coded up a game concept. It’s a web app that combines Tic Tac Toe with the twist of rotating rows and columns like a Rubik&#39;s Cube. The goal is to match four colors in a row, column, or diagonal. It’s pretty basic right now, and it works best on a laptop or tablet PC.</p> <p>One important aspect: the game lacks online gameplay or a computer player. You need 2 to 6 real players to play. This was an intentional choice to encourage more in-person interaction and less reliance on computer/online actions.</p> <p>I’d love for you to try it out and share your feedback!</p> <p><a href="http://tic-tac-slide.palashkantikundu.in/">http://tic-tac-slide.palashkantikundu.in/</a
