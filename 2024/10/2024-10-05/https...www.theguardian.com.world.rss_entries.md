<p>The event, which is celebrating its anniversary, has grown into a global phenomenon – and made us feel a whole lot better</p><p>Twenty years ago, on a windy, autumnal Saturday morning, 13 runners showed up to a park in south-west London for an event called the Bushy Park Time Trial. A 5km course was plotted and the organiser, Paul Sinton-Hewitt, a computer programmer who grew up in South Africa, bought washers from a hardware store to hand out as finish tokens. The times were tapped up on a laptop afterwards in a local Caffè Nero.</p><p>This Saturday, the weather hadn’t much improved – overcast, with the sun straining to peek through – and the venue was the same: picturesque Bushy Park with its resident red deer squaring up, ready to rut. But pretty much everything else about the impromptu get-together has evolved. Since 2008, it has been known as <a href="https://www.parkrun.org.uk/">Parkrun</a> and there are now 2,500 weekly events – all 5km, all free – in 22 countries, everywher
