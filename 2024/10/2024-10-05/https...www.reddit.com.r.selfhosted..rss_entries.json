I am completely new to this and just running off information I gleaned from lurking and asking questions in various subreddits but I need a bit more help now, but more clarifications. </p> <p>I have a small n100 PC I am currently running Plex from, with a 5tb external HDD attached to house the movies and TV shows I\u2019ve accumulated from ripping dvds from second hand shops. </p> <p>I\u2019d like to begin trying my hand at the .arr suite, and already have Cyberghost VPN for the next year or so. For context, I live in Australia and would like to stop any incoming traffic being flagged by my ISP: my plan is to run the .arr and SABnzbd suite behind a VPN (maybe in a container by itself so Plex isn\u2019t covered by the VPN too). </p> <p>From browsing this site, I think my best bet would be to do all of this manually, install Sonarr, Radarr, Bazarr, Overseerr, all in a container (not sure if Portainer would be good here) and seperate SABnzbd from my tra", "id": 1270530, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1fwhaul/setting_up_home_server", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 450, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Setting Up Home Server", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-10-05T00:57:52+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Is there way to get monthly /weekly for all containers internet traffic?

It has a power issue. The first couple weeks it would turn on and work for a while but then randomly shut off, now it won\u2019t even turn on. I got the to power up once for 20 seconds or so but that was it, otherwise it will not power on. My brother has a working super box and i used his power cord, didn\u2019t work. Ive tried other troubleshooting as well, It\u2019s clearly an issue with the box. </p> <p>So here is problem, I didn\u2019t know about this until now and they bought it months ago, so outside the Amazon return / replacement window. I contacted to Amazon and seller is refusing to replace since it\u2019s outside 30 day window. Do I have any chance getting a replacement from super box themselves? Can I possibly fix this potential power supply issue myself? Any suggestions?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Cool_Calm_Collected\"> /u/Cool_Calm_Collected </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"ht", "id": 1270140, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1fwdq3z/super_box_s5_max_power_issue", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 450, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Super box s5 max power issue", "vote": 0}]
