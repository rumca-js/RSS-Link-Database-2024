Steven Kostanski has made the great bad movie his calling card: No one is elevating trash into treasure quite like the Canadian FX makeup maven turned director, whose abilities to transcend pastiche and stretch indie budgets into full-blown spectacle in films like <em>Manborg</em> and <em>PG: Psycho Goreman</em> should put him in a league with the likes of <em>Licorice Pizza</em> director Paul Thomas Anderson.
