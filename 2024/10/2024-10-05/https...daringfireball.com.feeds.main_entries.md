<p>Another good overview of the Automattic/WP Engine saga, this one from Ari Levy at CNBC:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mullenweg may be openly enthusiastic and grateful for the
employees he still has on board, but the WordPress community is a
mess. Many WP Engine customers are suffering, and Automattic is
gearing up for a legal fight against a private equity firm with
over $100 billion in assets.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hard not to be reminded, somewhat, of the righteous indignation fueling <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2010/03/napalm_in_the_morning">Steve Jobs’s end of life crusade against Google</a> for creating Android. Some big fundamental differences, of course. WordPress is GPL open source and iOS isn’t open at all. It’s the righteous fervor of the founder/leader of the company that’s reminiscent.</p>
