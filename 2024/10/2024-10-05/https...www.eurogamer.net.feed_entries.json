With the space dominated by behemoths Valorant and Counter-Strike, newcomers are up against established games with deep tactical gameplay, distinctive world designs, and dedicated communities. Newbies face a demanding set of player expectations, with a checklist that includes immaculate gunplay, perfect pacing and ultra-clear level design as the bare minimum. And only when you get beyond that do things get really interesting. What have you got that's fresh, and can encourage new forms of tactical thinking? Can you provide enough of a hook that players will want to stick around to master the mechanics? Is your game simply <em>different </em>enough to stand out?</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/spectre-divide-review-a-unique-two-body-", "id": 1271323, "language": "en-gb", "link": "https://www.eurogamer.net/spectre-divide-review-a-unique-two-body-concept-falls-flat", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 107, "source_url": "https://www.eurogamer.net/feed", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/spectre-divide-review-header.png?width=1920&height=1920&fit=bounds&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp", "title": "Spectre Divide review - a unique two-body concept falls flat", "vote": 0}]
