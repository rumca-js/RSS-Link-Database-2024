<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I&#39;ve been running Klipper/Moonraker/Mainsail/Fluidd on my RPI Zero 2 W with a Logitech C270 Webcam I&#39;ve had lot of shutdowns in Klipper with timer too close errors even after reducing the number of processes running on the system.</p> <p>Am I correct in stating that the RPI cam will tax the system less than the USB webcam? At idle the system is showing 3 or 4% cpu usage and 50% memory usage.</p> <p>I&#39;m assuming I should choose between mainsail or fluidd and uninstall all extranious Klipper add ons to try and conserve system resources. </p> <p>I have heard of people successfully running a camera on the Zero 2 W, I&#39;m not super concerned about time lapse I just would like remote monitoring and print monitoring. I really really don&#39;t wanna buy another 3 or 4 as availability and prices still aren&#39;t great.</p> <p>I have the following services running: </p> <p>UNIT LOAD ACTIVE SUB DESCRIPTION &gt;</p> <p>cron.service loaded active

Yesterday I decided to switch over to vs code on the recommendation of a friend and the raspberry disconnected from the hotspot and it has refused to connect since. I am not sure what to do now. I could reset the sd card and enter the details of the hotspot again however then i would lose weeks of work.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m trying to run a Python script automatically on my Raspberry Pi 5, 3 seconds after booting, directly in the terminal (using Console Autologin), without loading the desktop environment. Iâ€™ve already tried a few methods:</p> <ol> <li><p>Created a `systemd` service to run the script after a delay, but it didnâ€™t execute in the terminal as expected.</p></li> <li><p>Edited the `.bashrc` file to run the script on the primary terminal (`tty1`) after a 3-second delay, but it didnâ€™t trigger.</p></li> <li><p>Modified `/etc/profile` with a similar check for `tty1` and added a delay, but still no luck.</p></li> </ol> <p>None of these methods worked, and I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s an issue specific to Raspberry Pi 5 or something else in the boot process. Any advice on how I can successfully get my script to run automatically in the terminal after boot would be much appreciated!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.c

## RPi 400 switching HDMI... **WHEN POWERED OFF!**

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m having a problem. I bought the Raspberry Pi 400, and I&#39;m using it with RPi OS. For a while, I thought I had a faulty HDMI switch -- <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07SYHQ2PS/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">this one</a>. The auto-switching &quot;feature&quot; on the switch would randomly switch to the RPi port when I was in the middle of playing a video game on another port. This happened when the RPi was off. It&#39;s always off when I&#39;m not using it. So, I changed HDMI switches. I started using <a href="https://www.amazon.com/HDMI-Switch-Box-Switcher-Projector/dp/B0BJFQDCHZ/ref=sr_1_1?crid=TFW499V0A8LR&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.AEsldyhRmNOswPJ4Vb7VqXCuMlEnzIhIBfcLlrqWawcjoC4S4IWUwt9CFXcE97aZm78D8-642Hm_rLU-RbQtUeN8jttcbVlqEfO049gKtuwYdPFx0J0AfaDw3hGAhL0L7DXqa1E80msh9OYPnTTmgnBnum7xzboLm_yXUMvTf1OEIzU5g5iFzhekRujb8NzYSl-e9z-keLZhhqz3Pjl_NK3lPxRG2SzzVSncG15lDVi9bNu3q4D7CaZgBb9pSf1V4Y8Z1VY3W9bz-OOpDFNMemLWtH9K
