<p>It was inevitable Anthony Gordon would feature prominently on his return to Goodison Park but this was not how the Newcastle forward would have envisaged the script. Gordon was denied from the penalty spot by his England colleague Jordan Pickford as Everton and Newcastle fought out a highly entertaining goalless draw.</p><p>The former Everton forward also wasted chances from open play as Eddie Howe’s side failed to build on last weekend’s impressive display in the draw against Manchester City. They also escaped a strong Everton claim for a second-half penalty when Dan Burn brought Dominic Calvert-Lewin crashing down in front of goal. The video assistant referee found Calvert-Lewin guilty of the initial foul.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/05/everton-newcastle-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The electorate for the Conservative leadership contest likes a winner, but lately has had trouble picking one</p><p>The Conservative party is more than just 121 MPs. It’s also tens of thousands of ordinary members. The £39 a year they pay to belong might not entitle them to any real say on the party’s policies, but it does give them the right to help select its candidates and, even better, its leader.</p><p>Quite how many individual blades make up the Tory grassroots these days, we won’t know until we learn the result of the membership ballot, which starts on 31 October. In 2019, when Johnson was elected leader, it came in at 159,000. And in 2022, when Liz Truss got the nod, it had actually risen to 172,000. But that was considerably down on the 254,000 who got to choose between Davids Cameron and Davis back in 2005 and way off the 2.8 million members that the party claimed to have at its postwar peak in the mid-1950s.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/oct/05/w

<p>Liverpool are a club that live on emotions. There’s be no shame in that. What else is football for than a swell of feelings? But if it was love at first sight with Jürgen Klopp, when will the faithful fall for Arne Slot? A superb start to the season, top of the table when it was supposed to be Arsenal and Manchester City streaking away, he could hardly have done a better job. Too cool for school? Possibly. A hangover from those last days of the Klopp romance ending so bittersweetly? Almost certainly.</p><p>Slot himself is happy to be stay cool, distant. “Brilliant would have been nine wins out of nine,” he demurred before kick-off. There will be no touchline pogo, no bearlike screams, even if he can be demonstrative from the technical area.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/05/crystal-palace-liverpool-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>You’ll need onions, celery and garlic, as usual, but mushrooms are the real stars of the vegetarian bolognese show</p><p><strong>What’s the best thing to use in a meat-free </strong><strong>bolognese? I’ve </strong><strong>tried dried soy beans, but the result was </strong><strong>disappointing. </strong><strong>Any tips</strong><strong>, spices</strong><strong> or magic ingredients you can think of?</strong> <em><br><strong>Chloé, Belgium<br></strong></em>If you’re after something that tastes as close to bolognese as you can get without using meat, mushrooms are your friend here, especially when they’re supported by other big-hitting ingredients such as miso or Marmite, soy sauce and red wine.</p><p>Slowly sweat onions, garlic, celery and carrots in plenty of olive oil until soft and sweet, then add the mushrooms – I find that a mix of fresh and rehydrated dried ones works best, especially if you also use the mushroom soaking water, too – then build up the sauce from there: a spla

<p>A journey to a game can lead you into the dark underbelly of rail travel, especially from London’s most unloved station</p><p>It would be wrong to take too much credit, to start throwing around phrases such as <em>guerrilla&nbsp;intervention</em> or <em>self-styled people’s transport tsar</em>, after reports began to appear this week of dramatic government concessions&nbsp;on the multibillion-pound redevelopment of Euston station.</p><p>Other people might want to use words like disrupter, influencer, even hero. Obviously I can’t stop them. I might even encourage them to do so if it helps to add labels, to repeat words that are already&nbsp;out&nbsp;there, phrases such as rainmaker, opinioniser, thoughtfluencer, twat and who is this annoying bloke.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/05/euston-you-have-a-problem-train-travel-to-football-and-the-basic-futility-of-hope">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Sunday’s women’s Super League Grand Final will be the Saints’ scrum-half last game – three years after being told she would never play again</p><p>Faye Gaskin pulls the strings for St Helens. In a season that will end on Sunday with Saints facing York Valkyrie in the Women’s Super League Grand Final, she has been the magic in the middle, her playmaking skills at scrum-half earning a nomination as Woman of Steel in Tuesday’s Rugby League Awards.</p><p>It’s an amazing achievement, especially given the messy fractured kneecap she was told had ended her career three years ago, and which still causes her “pain which shoots up by knee every time I kick the ball”. But Sunday will be both Gaskin’s first Grand Final and her last game. At 32, her priority is a family of her own.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/05/st-helens-faye-gaskin-you-cant-be-going-through-ivf-while-youre-still-playing">Continue reading...</a>
