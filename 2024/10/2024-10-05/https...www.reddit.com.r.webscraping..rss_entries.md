<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all,</p> <p>I found a hidden API in an application im using. I want to use multiple accounts to access this hidden API.</p> <p>However, the authorization token expires when i logout, preventing me from accessing the API while using that authorization token.</p> <p>Now im wondering, is there anyway to go about preserving my authorization token AFTER logging out?</p> <p>I need to logout so that I can login to my other accounts and get their authorization tokens.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Different-Dog-9997"> /u/Different-Dog-9997 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1fwer66/preserving_authorization_tokenbearer/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1fwer66/preserving_authorization_tokenbearer/">[comments]</a></span>
