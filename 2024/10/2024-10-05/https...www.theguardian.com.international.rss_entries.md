<p>A Panthers four-peat would eclipse an already scarcely believable feat while a Melbourne win would warrant a recalibration of recent history</p><p>Penrith wear the title of modern rugby league’s greatest, a crown fitted by the past three premierships and forged in the defeat to the Storm in the 2020 decider. But in Melbourne’s return to the first weekend in October, Penrith’s dynasty faces its one true challenger. Melbourne started it, and so it is apt that Melbourne can end it.</p><p>Four years ago the Storm won the only grand final between the pair, watched by half a stadium due to Covid, but only narrowly. The Panthers’ roaring 20-point comeback left them just short, and they departed Homebush with all the momentum but without a trophy. They would sustain the excellence of that second half for three years, their run of premierships securing them the loftiest status in the sport.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/06/classic-nrl-grand-final-in-the-offing-as-h

<p>Talents such as Nicolas Jackson are making waves in Enzo Maresca’s squad but plenty of others are going nowhere</p><p>Thirteen points from their past six games, 15 goals scored, and Chelsea went into the weekend fourth in the Premier League table. The mood suddenly has changed. What crisis? Maybe the great disruptors had it right all along. Or at least maybe now that they seem set on disrupting each other and the focus has shifted to potential buyouts and leadership squabbles, Enzo Maresca has been able to get on with building a team.</p><p>Decisions that seemed baffling at the time can now be cast in a more favourable light. When Raheem Sterling released a statement seconds after the official announcement that he had been left out of Chelsea’s opening game of the season, it seemed indicative of the chaos at the club. If they had no need for him, why had he played such a prominent role in pre-season? And why, given their much-vaunted policy of buying young players on long contracts

<p>Dating back to rock art made 25,000 years ago in north-eastern Brazil, through to 17th-century Dutch landscape paintings, to high-definition photographs modified with artificial intelligence, artists have long turned to trees for inspiration. A new book brings together a wide array of work by artists including Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Hilma af Klint and William Kentridge. “I am always amazed at how many ways trees can be depicted in art – paintings, sculptures, models, living art, photography, jewellery,” says Tony Kirkham, retired head of the arboretum at Kew’s Royal Botanic Gardens, who wrote the introduction to the book. “Each tree has its own character like a person: they are charismatic in their own right.”</p><ul><li><em><a href="https://www.phaidon.com/store/art/tree-exploring-the-arboreal-world-9781838667795/">Tree: Exploring the Arboreal World (Phaidon, £44.95)</a> is out now</em></li></ul> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2024/oct/05/evergreen-art-d

<p>(Naive)<br>The London-born musician laces his jazz with a heady blend of soul and hip-hop on this fierce but joyous second album</p><p>Henry’s 2019 debut, <em><a href="https://ashleyhenrymusic.bandcamp.com/album/beautiful-vinyl-hunter">Beautiful Vinyl Hunter</a></em>, showed the London-born pianist was very much his own man; he played, sang, composed and produced, while attracting a weighty bunch of collaborators. Most striking of all was its musical diversity, a meld of jazz, soul and hip-hop. <em>Who We Are </em>pursues the same innovative grail and at a likewise generous 14 tracks. The mood is almost relentlessly upbeat, borne along on Henry’s love of plunging chords and funky riffs. Opener Love Is Like a Movie is a case in point, a droll romantic call beautifully sung by Judi Jackson, after which come <a href="https://youtu.be/80fXLaZcQrg">Take It Higher</a>, whose strings and massed vocals recall Nuyorican Soul, and the <a href="https://youtu.be/xMo4r5vzM1I">title track</a>, a

<p>Sebastian Stan excels as a facially disfigured actor whose life is transformed in Aaron Schimberg’s mordant oddity</p><p>Some films strive to take us under the skin of a character. And then there’s Aaron Schimberg’s mordant oddity, <em>A Different Man</em>, a picture that peels back chunks of livid flesh to explore the overstuffed psychological baggage of Edward (Sebastian Stan, encased in prosthetics). An aspiring actor with severe facial disfigurement, Edward volunteers for an experimental treatment that “cures” his condition. He severs ties with his old identity, starting a new life as Guy (Stan minus the prosthetics), a hotshot estate agent.</p><p>But physical beauty is not always the happy ending that we assume it will be. Guy becomes obsessed with Oswald (British actor and TV presenter Adam Pearson), who he views as a happier, more successful version of his former self.

He struggled to find work after the plant closures and was forced to travel across the country for contract jobs.</p><p>So Allardyce, now a leader of a Saginaw branch of the US’s largest electricians union, understands blue-collar anger over the free trade agreements that allowed car makers and other industries to move hundreds of thousands of well-paying jobs into Mexico and Canada since the 1990s. He sees how the resulting economic decline and rising poverty in the industrial heartlands helped elect Donald Trump in 2016.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/05/biden-jobs-saginaw-michigan-trump-voters">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A juicy, savoury, sticky dish to mop up with wads of good bread</p><p>This is a bit of a ready steady cook number, born out of an excess of courgettes. I (loosely) had in mind a Nigel Slater recipe that I often used to make for friends: <a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/recipes/sauteed-chicken-with-garlic-and-parsley">chicken with plenty of garlic, herbs and wine</a>, from his book, Appetite, which I’d serve with his <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/feb/08/baking-recipe">2009 recipe for green olive focaccia</a> and a green salad. I rarely eat chicken nowadays, but I miss the deep, savoury, caramelised garlicky flavour and the juiciness of that dish, so I very much enjoyed reincarnating that in today’s recipe.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/oct/05/vegan-recipe-caramelised-garlic-courgette-and-butter-beans-meera-sodha">Continue reading...</a>

<p>My hopeful expectations have been confounded at every turn. But one day Israelis will grasp that endless war against Palestinians doesn’t work </p><p>At the start of Israel’s war on Gaza, when the intensive bombing of civilians began, the thought in my mind was: how will we Palestinians live with the Israelis after this? Twelve months later, with no relenting in the killings and the destruction of Gaza, with Israel spreading the conflict to the West Bank, where <a href="https://www.ochaopt.org/content/humanitarian-situation-update-225-west-bank">more than 700</a> Palestinians have been killed, and its escalatory attacks in Lebanon and Iran, the question has only become more pertinent.</p><p>In the course of these past 12 months many atrocities have been committed, starting with the killing by Palestinians of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/18/israeli-west-bank-strikes-gaza-death-toll-palestine-war-hamas">1,200 Israeli soldiers and civilians</a>, followed by the

<p>The artist Maisara Baroud and his family have been displaced 12 times since the start of the Israel-Gaza war. In pictures and words, he describes their journey and the impact of the fighting</p><p>The artist Maisara Baroud never found living in Gaza easy. The Israeli-Egyptian blockade, imposed in 2007 after Hamas’s violent takeover of the territory, was suffocating, and Rimal, his middle-class neighbourhood in<strong> </strong>Gaza City<strong>,</strong> had not been spared from airstrikes in the previous wars with Israel.</p><p>Despite everything, he said, his family worked hard to establish a simple, quiet existence after being expelled from their village in what is now Israel in 1948.

<p>A two-bean salad with marinated tuna on whipped ricotta, and a Basque-style prawn, chickpea and tarragon stew</p><p></p><p>There are many reasons we should all be eating lots of beans and peas. The one that motivates me the most, however, is quite how tasty they are. When it comes to precooked pulses, there’s a real range in what’s available these days, and in terms of size, texture, cost and flavour, too. I use both tins and jars, and lots of different brands, too, but when the beans are the heart of a dish, it’s those that come in tall, see-through jars that I tend to splash out on. They’re bigger and softer than the tinned sort, and also have more flavour, which makes them as good to eat pretty much straight from the jar as they are to absorb all manner of flavours in a slow-cooked stew.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/oct/05/yotam-ottolenghi-bean-recipes-spicy-tuna-salad-prawn-chickpea-stew">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This genre-defying journey into the science of classification weaves memoir and history in shimmering prose</p><p>Lulu Miller’s book arrives in the UK four years late, already an international bestseller. Fittingly for a story about the limits of&nbsp;categorisation, it defies literary taxonomy. The frame is a biography of&nbsp;David Starr Jordan, the founding president of Stanford University and tireless ichthyologist whose team catalogued one-fifth of all the fish we&nbsp;can identify today. But that frame contains a memoir, a love story, philosophy, psychology, true crime, some powerful reportage and a decent stab at the meaning of life, all in about 200 pages. File under <em>sui generis</em>.</p><p>Miller, an American science journalist, first latched on to Jordan’s story while in the throes of heartbreak, shame and annihilating depression, seeing him as an exemplar of perseverance against the odds. In 1883, a few<strong> </strong>years into his fish-collecting career, a bolt o

<p>With the leaves turning golden, now is the time to visit the woods, says the author of a new book, and perhaps learn how to better protect them too</p><p>There are two times of year I particularly love being among trees. The first is at the height of spring, when new leaves and woodland plants are at their most intensely green. The second is the point in autumn when the summer hues shift overnight and the woods take on a whole new coat. In&nbsp;Japanese there is&nbsp;a&nbsp;wonderful term for both, <em>mikkaminumanosakura</em>, meaning a moment of sudden, dramatic change. As we move deeper into autumn, we’re&nbsp;heading for one of these moments, and I’ll be out in the woods trying to catch it.</p><p>I have spent much of the past two years travelling the length of the UK and Ireland exploring our relationship with trees and woodlands for a new book.

I’ve long been a bean enthusiast, but after learning more about how good they are for the planet, even when grown within the conventional, non-organic farming system, I’ve been using them much more both in my recipes and in my home cooking. I now add beans in some shape or form to most meals, from spaghetti bolognese (by replacing 50% of the pasta with beans) to a rich, meaty stew (by reducing the amount of meat). Even so, by the end of most weeks, we usually still have some beans left over, which is when I get really inventive. These blondies, for example, are extra-nutritious, super-fudgy and very simple to make.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/oct/05/turn-excess-beans-into
