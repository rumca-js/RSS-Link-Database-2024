Is it an fps with roguelite element or prehaps a metroidvania that has survival elements. I&#39;d say try for 3 genres to make it but whatever you make works. </p> <p>For me I would start with automation I love this genre and would love to see more of it add in some RTS elements of building a factory or factories to fight a war and set up logistics to the front line sounds awesome to me. Last would probably be FPS so that I can be part of the action and even drive some of my war machines and have some explosive fun. </p> <p>But thats just me.
