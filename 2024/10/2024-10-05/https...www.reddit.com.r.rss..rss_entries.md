<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have large number of Saved posts in FaceBook, saved for later reading. These are grouped in suitably named Collections. Is it possible to construct a RSS for each of these Collections? That way i would be able to have these links to interesting posts out of FaceBook web gui, listed in my RSS reader. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ReadyTone2180"> /u/ReadyTone2180 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1fwibwu/rss_feeds_for_your_own_saves_in_facebook/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1fwibwu/rss_feeds_for_your_own_saves_in_facebook/">[comments]</a></span>
