The feature, called Gmail Q&amp;A, lets you find specific emails and information by asking the Gemini chatbot questions. You can ask things like &quot;What time is our dinner reservation on Saturday?&quot; to quickly find the information you need. It was only initially available on Android devices, but now Google has started <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2024/10/gmail-q-and-a-now-available-on-ios-devices.html">rolling it out to iPhones</a>.&nbsp;</p>
