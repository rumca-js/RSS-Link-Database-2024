You've already seen our analysis pieces on how each of those games compares on Pro against the standard model, along with a breakdown of PSSR upscaling quality up against DLSS and FSR. However, one piece of feedback we received loud and clear was the demand just to see more of the games running, without any of our customary head-to-head comparisons.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digital-foundry-posts-more-the-last-of-us-part-2-ps4-pro-capture">Read more</a></p>

## PS5 Pro's PSSR upscaler tested against FSR 3.1 and Nvidia DLSS 3.7 in Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart

With PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution (PSSR), Sony has joined the machine-learning based image reconstruction race started by Nvidia almost six years ago. At Digital Foundry, we're excited to see this kind of technology reach into the console space and so as part of our recent exclusive PS5 Pro capture opportunity, we spent some time using PS5 Pro and Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart to grab a series of reconstruction-based shots that we know from prior experience truly puts reconstruction technologies through their paces. To what extent can PSSR best the FSR-level technology typically used by consoles? And how close is PSSR to the acknowledged state-of-the-art: Nvidia DLSS?

## Antonblast is the angry, raucous and explosive twin of Wario Land, and this year's Pizza Tower

<img src="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/antonblast-wishlisted.jpg?width=1920&height=1920&fit=bounds&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp" /> <p>I can't quite decide if Antonblast is destructive genius or just a little bit too chaotic for its own good. Following in Wario's preferred mode of 2D platforming - aka: slamming Anton's thick shoulders, gritted chin and whirling, Taz the Tasmanian Devil-style hurricane legs into every obstacle going rather than a polite bop on the head a la Mario, Antonblast is big on screenshake, exploding paraphernalia and pinballing through levels like a raging battering ram. It's wonderfully frenetic, as the two levels in its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1887400/ANTONBLAST/">Steam Next Fest demo</a> make plain.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/antonblast-is-the-angry-raucous-and-explosive-twin-of-wario-land-and-this-years-pizza-tower">Read more</a></p>

<img src="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Little-to-the-Left-jars-and-cartons.jpg?width=1920&height=1920&fit=bounds&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp" /> <p>Hello! Welcome back to our regular feature where we write a little bit about some of the games we've been playing over the past few days. We've moved this to a regular Saturday slot to give it a little more time to breathe - appologies if you came looking for it on Friday. This week, we tackle some puzzles while holidaying in a cabin, we go back to a game that had been forgotten about, and try to find some grip during a sharp turn on snow. What have you been playing?</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-weve-been-playing-island-puzzles-organisational-fun-and-hairpin-turns">Read more</a></p>
