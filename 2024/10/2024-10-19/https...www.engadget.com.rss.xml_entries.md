<p><em>The following article discusses the fifth season of Star Trek: Lower Decks and older Treks.</em></p>
<p>There’s no such thing as “dead” in <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/star-trek/">Star Trek</a>, the sprawling, perpetual opus that has thrived in spite of itself for almost sixty years. What started as a cornball space-ships and punch-fights show for atomic-age kids and their parents has become (gestures around) all this. So I’m not writing too much of an obituary for <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-lower-decks-season-finale-delivers-exactly-what-it-promises-130051733.html"><em>Star Trek: Lower Decks</em></a> despite its fifth season being its last. Given Paramount’s fluid leadership right now, I can easily imagine that decision being reversed in the future. So this isn’t so much of a goodbye as a farewell for now.</p>

<p>DJI has <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/chinese-dronemaker-dji-sues-pentagon-over-chinese-military-listing-2024-10-19/">filed a lawsuit</a> against the US Department of Defense over its addition to the Pentagon list that designates it as a &quot;Chinese military company.&quot; In its filing, shared by <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/19/24274153/dji-sues-us-dod-chinese-military-company"><em>The Verge</em></a>, the company said it&#39;s challenging the designation because it&#39;s &quot;neither owned nor controlled by the Chinese military.&quot; It described itself as the &quot;largest privately owned seller of consumer and commercial drones,&quot; mostly used by first responders, fire and police departments, businesses and hobbyists.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The company claimed that because the Pentagon has officially proclaimed it as a national security threat, it has suffered &quot;ongoing financial and reputational harm.&quot
