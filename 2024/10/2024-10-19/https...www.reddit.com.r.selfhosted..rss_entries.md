<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am on a self hosted kick lately, finally getting around to setting up Jellyfin, some cameras, as well as a few other services for the house / family. I have small pc&#39;s on every TV, as well as a decent proliant Micro Server running Proxmox and (soon) a ton of storage.</p> <p>A lot of the services are accessed through the browser, though, and I&#39;d like to have a good start page set up on for the devices. Just the general stuff like bookmarks, and network resources. Some widgets would be nice, like maybe for some streaming audio or something, but not critical. </p> <p>I know I can build a web page and deploy it, but I&#39;d like something more dynamic, that I can update in the browser easily, and without too much hassle. </p> <p>Does anyone here use a tool like this?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ganjaccount"> /u/ganjaccount </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/com

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>If you&#39;re in the market for a reliable OS for your self-hosted server, Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2021 is a fantastic option. LTSC (Long-Term Servicing Channel) versions of Windows are built for stability, with no feature updates—just critical security patches for up to 10 years. This means you won’t have surprise reboots or changes messing with your setup. Plus, LTSC is stripped of unnecessary bloat like Cortana and the Microsoft Store, so it&#39;s lean and efficient. I&#39;ve had mine running continuously for months without issues. It’s ideal if you want a low-maintenance, always-on server that&#39;s still Windows-friendly for software compatibility.</p> <p>The main downside? LTSC isn’t aimed at consumers, so getting a license might take some effort. But if you&#39;re after long-term stability with minimal interference, it’s worth looking into!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Brilliant_Read3

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello everyone, after several years of running plex in a Synology ds720, decided to move everything to my new ms-01. Will run plex or jellyfin in an lxc container (still haven’t decided if I want to abandon plex, jf webos app is awful and I’ll miss Tautulli)and need to decide whwre to store my media. I read about this in many threads and possibly have restricted the choice to 2 solutions: - VM with TrueNas - LXC with Cockpit Am I missing anything better than these 2? The most used configuration is to passthrough a disk to the OS (my idea is to pass one of the gen 3 nvme), is this really necessary or also a virtual disk will work fine? Also if I’m gonna use a single nvme, which would be the preferred filesystem? Classic zfs or etx4 or else?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ilbarone87"> /u/ilbarone87 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1g75553/media_storage_in_proxm

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Here’s my situation and basic setup, I try to not expose anything to the outside world that I can avoid. However there are always going to be somethings I need access to outside of my home, such as Bitwarden, NextCloud, etc. </p> <p>For example I currently expose Bitwarden via a CF tunnel and use the iOS client and browser extensions to access it. However that does mean the only thing standing in between anyone who discovers that url and my passwords is a strong master password. I have played around with the zero trust authentication stuff however it does tend to make connecting first and even third party client apps to my services if not impossible, a damn headache. </p> <p>My question is this. Without over complicating my existing infrastructure and adding a VPN layer, is there a way to secure the tunnels in a fashion that would inhibit “unauthorised access”.
