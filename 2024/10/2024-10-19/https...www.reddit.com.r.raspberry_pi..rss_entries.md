<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I need help with the built in raspberry pi os SD card copier software. It used to work fine about 3months ago but now it doesn&#39;t.</p> <p>Example. I have 2 pi 4b boards and 4 SD cards the same size. I use the tool to copy and it says it is successful but when I insert those copied cards to the pi units, both of them. They produce a failed debian prompt on bootup the os never loads. I&#39;m using bookworm 64bit os latest updates. If I insert the original SD card it works fine.i have formatted the 3 spare cards, re copied reinserted to both pi units and neither of them load.</p> <p>As a test now I used the raspberry imager, redownloaded the raspberry 64bit desktop version and flashed the sd card. Worked fine on the pi. I ran SD card copier on 2 SD cards. Said completed. Inserted both cards same deal does not work. I just don&#39;t get it</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ArchangelZero27"> /u/Archan

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all,<br/> I&#39;m trying to install Rpi OS <strong>Lite</strong> x64 (bookworm) on a Pi 3B for a school project. Being the Lite version, there&#39;s no GUI, so I have to do the config ahead of time. Using the imager settings, I create a very simple user name and password (it&#39;s literally <em>user</em>/<em>user</em>), as security isn&#39;t required for this application. SSH is enabled, password option.<br/> I burn the image, and all appears well. When I boot the Pi and SSH in, I get:<br/> &quot;login as:&quot;<br/> I enter &quot;user&quot;<br/> output is: &quot;<a href="mailto:user@192.168.11.20">user@192.168.11.20</a>&#39;s password:&quot;<br/> I enter: &quot;user&quot;<br/> output is &quot;Access denied&quot;<br/> Ummm... what?</p> <p>I&#39;ve read in several other threads that some are having trouble getting the imager to actually create the settings it says it will. Since I don&#39;t have the option to log in via the desktop GUI, what&#39;s t
