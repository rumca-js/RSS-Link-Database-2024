  <p id="JpDQZL">When people search for “Adam driver <em>Megalopolis</em>” on Instagram or Facebook right now, instead of seeing posts about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24243766/megalopolis-review">Francis Ford Coppola’s latest film</a>, they’re shown a warning, titled, “Child sexual abuse is illegal.” </p>
<p id="y0iQbq">That bizarre fact was <a href="https://x.com/GraceGFreud/status/1847446202230477125">pointed out</a> in a post on X yesterday, and as of today, I’m still seeing it when I search for the phrase. But why? Well, it doesn’t seem to have anything to do with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/11/24267898/m

In its unaltered state, it’s a nice-to-look-at, nostalgic relic that’s unusable in modern contexts.

  <p id="nm9Ha6">DJI, the world’s largest drone company, is suing to avoid being seen as a tool of the Chinese government. On Friday, it sued the US Department of Defense to delete its name from a list of “Chinese Military Companies,” claiming it has no such relationship to Chinese authorities and has suffered unfairly as a result of that designation.</p>
<p id="Vdu3EY">Since DJI was added to that list in 2022, the company claims, it has “lost business deals, been stigmatized as a national security threat, and been banned from contracting with multiple federal government agencies,” and that its employees “now suffer frequent and pervasive stigmatization” and are “repeatedly ha

  <p id="cisDOy">Sometimes you just need a portable electric cookset. Maybe it’s during a major power outage when everyone’s huddled together over the warm glow of the family power station. Or maybe it’s at a tailgate party or picnic. In my case, it’s anywhere I decided to park my van over the last few months while testing two cooking systems from Stoke Voltaics.</p>
<p id="6k23sI">Most portable cooksets are powered by a liquid fuel like propane. It’s inexpensive and readily available in canisters of all sizes. But sometimes you’d rather not deal with an open flame, pollutants, and the noise and smell that comes with it.
