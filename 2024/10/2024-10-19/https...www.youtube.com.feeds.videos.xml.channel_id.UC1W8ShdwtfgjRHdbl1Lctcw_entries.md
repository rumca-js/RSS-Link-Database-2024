I colorized with a new technique, restored and created a sound design for this video of Hamburg, Germany  in the 1920s. You can clearly see what's going on in broad daylight, with the city's main activities and  population and transport and the management of the city's cleanliness.

Video Restoration Process:
âœ” FPS boosted to 60 frames per second 
âœ” Image resolution boosted up to HD 
âœ” Improved video sharpness and brightness 
âœ” Colorized only for the ambiance (not historically accurate)
âœ”added sound only for the ambiance
âœ”restoration:(stabilisation,denoise,cleand,deblur) 
âœ”Deinterlacing

Please, be aware that colorization colors are not real and fake, colorization was made only for the ambiance and do not represent real historical data.
