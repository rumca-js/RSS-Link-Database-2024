<ul><li>Manchester City manager ‘never expected’ huge success</li><li>City visit struggling Wolves on Sunday in Premier League</li></ul><p>Pep Guardiola says he will quit ­football entirely when he loses the passion to manage after revealing he has no ambition to take a different role in the game.

## Thomas Tuchel’s arrival highlights English football’s failure to produce top managers | Jonathan Wilson

<p>Junior-level success cannot mask the fact that the Premier League stifles the development of home-grown coaches</p><p>The good news for the battered pride of English coaching is that, even leaving Lee Carsley and his complicated status aside, England still provides the manager for 11 national teams. Although France and Italy also supply 11, only Spain, with 14, offer more. The less positive news is that, according to the Fifa world rankings, the best of those sides are Jamaica (61st), New Zealand (95th) and Puerto Rico (154th).</p><p>It’s not to demean the work of Steve McClaren, Darren Bazeley or Charlie Trout to suggest that that does not sound like the record of a major football nation. It’s true that Spain’s tally includes the coaches of Brunei and Belize, but Spaniards also manage Portugal and, crucially, Spain. France’s list includes South Sudan and New Caledonia, but also Georgia and France. Italians manage Nepal and San Marino, but also Turkey and Italy. You don’t have to b

## Sokler and Shinnie strike as Aberdeen fightback for draw with Celtic

<p>At half-time, the billing of this fixture as a top of the table extravaganza felt like a breach of the Trades Descriptions Act. What happened next owed plenty to Celtic defensive deficiency and Aberdeen’s refusal to wilt. At four minutes past five, with 101 minutes on the clock, time was called on an extraordinary encounter. The sharing of four goals was fair; if Celtic are as generous in Champions League action against Atalanta on Wednesday, the outcome will be a grisly one for Brendan Rodgers. Jimmy Thelin’s Aberdeen still tie Celtic at the summit of Scotland’s top flight.</p><p>Celtic had been so comfortable at the break that it was impossible to see this coming. Aberdeen lacked belief and anything approaching fluency. The visitors’ jitters were clear with 12 minutes played, when the goalkeeper Dimitar Mitov conceded possession directly to Arne Engels. Celtic’s record signing hit the crossbar with an angled effort.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/19/ce

<p>Hosts attempting to create turning surface for deciding Test after their gambles on selection and pitch paid off in Multan</p><p>Brendon McCullum may believe that only Superman could have saved England from defeat once they found themselves chasing 297 on a turning wicket in the second Test – suggesting at that point they were doomed “save for someone coming out of the telephone box” – but the coach praised Pakistan’s gamble on re-using a tired pitch, describing it as “a good punt”. “I actually don’t mind,” he said. “I think home teams should be allowed to have conditions that suit themselves. I thought they did brilliantly.”</p><p>The series now moves to traditionally less spin-friendly Rawalpindi for Thursday’s decider; in seven Tests played there over the past five years seamers have bowled 56% of the deliveries and taken 64% of the wickets. “I don’t know if I’ve seen a turner in Rawalpindi,” said Shan Masood, the Pakistan captain, though the Pakistan Cricket Board’s chief curat

I stared at the pair across from me, folded on the scratched wood bar beside the lemon wedges and cocktail napkins.

It was another night of yearning at a gay bar and I was contemplating going home with the man beside me because his hands kept a score (“I’m&nbsp;65!” they screamed) that belied everything he’d done to hide the decades behind him. His face looked middle-aged, no doubt thanks to a skin-care routine that cost more each month than my whole wardrobe; his body was toned from years spent in the gym; and his hair was buzzed on the side and longer on the top, which was fashionable in New York back then. Everyone in cosmopolitan western cities tries to look young. But I&nbsp;only slept with men who looked
