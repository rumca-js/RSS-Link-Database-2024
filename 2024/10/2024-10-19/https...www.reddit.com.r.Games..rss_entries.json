It&#39;s mostly just a personal project, but I&#39;m planning to maintain it and if it could be useful to anyone out there, great!</p> <p>Here&#39;s the site: <a href=\"http://metroidvaniadb.com/\">metroidvaniadb.com</a></p> <p>Since there are a ton of MV games out there and I definitely don&#39;t have time to fully research every one, I opted to use AI (claude) to populate the database, then allow users to modify anything wiki-style. I realize that this means that a lot of the information is going to be false, but rather than spend another six months researching everything myself, I&#39;m hoping that people with that knowledge already will help out. I&#39;m going to continue updating things as I can.</p> <p>It&#39;s still a work in progress, so if anyone has any useful feedback, it would be much appreciated. I&#39;m sure there are bugs in it", "id": 1354900, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1g7ktjv/my_attempt_at_a_metroidvania_database_website", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 497, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "My attempt at a Metroidvania database website", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-10-19T21:44:36+00:00", "description": "&#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/megaapple\"> /u/megaapple </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://delistedgames.com/hi-rez-studios-announces-february-17th-shutdown-for-realm-royale-and-divine-knockout/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1g7jhwn/hirez_studios_announces_february_17th_shutdown/\">[comments]</a></span>", "id": 1354715, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1g7jhwn/hirez_studios_announces_february_17th_shutdown", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 497, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Hi-Rez Studios announces February 17th shutdown for Realm Royale and DKO Divine Knockout", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-10-19T20:06:04+00:00", "description": "&#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/GiantPurplePen15\"> /u/GiantPurplePen15 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1SIA_2ispc\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1g7hfwx/was_it_good_kings_field_2/\">[comments]</a></span>", "id": 1354583, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1g7hfwx/was_it_good_kings_field_2", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 497, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Was it Good? - King's Field 2", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-10-19T19:35:45+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I think it&#39;s why I have genuinely never finished a game in my life (apart from Until Dawn but that&#39;s a really short game &amp; LA Noire now that I think about it but I didn&#39;t 100% it.
