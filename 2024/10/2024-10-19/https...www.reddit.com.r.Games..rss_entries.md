<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi Everyone,</p> <p>For the past few months I&#39;ve been working on a wiki-style Metroidvania database website. It&#39;s mostly just a personal project, but I&#39;m planning to maintain it and if it could be useful to anyone out there, great!</p> <p>Here&#39;s the site: <a href="http://metroidvaniadb.com/">metroidvaniadb.com</a></p> <p>Since there are a ton of MV games out there and I definitely don&#39;t have time to fully research every one, I opted to use AI (claude) to populate the database, then allow users to modify anything wiki-style. I realize that this means that a lot of the information is going to be false, but rather than spend another six months researching everything myself, I&#39;m hoping that people with that knowledge already will help out. I&#39;m going to continue updating things as I can.</p> <p>It&#39;s still a work in progress, so if anyone has any useful feedback, it would be much appreciated. I&#39;m sure there are bugs in it

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s why I have genuinely never finished a game in my life (apart from Until Dawn but that&#39;s a really short game &amp; LA Noire now that I think about it but I didn&#39;t 100% it. Just did the story.)</p> <p>But basically I grind a specific game for hours and then I abandon it and come back to it months later and grind again. I&#39;m very meticulous for focusing more on side missions and collectibles than main story missions for some reason though. Not sure what that&#39;s about. </p> <p>I still haven&#39;t finished Breathe of the Wild, I&#39;m in the middle of playing Far Cry 3 &amp; 4, still got shit loads to do in Hogwarts Legacy. I started Immortal Fenyx Rising about 2 years ago and haven&#39;t picked it back up even though I enjoyed it and still want to play it lol. </p> <p>Then I also have hundreds of hours in Animal Crossing and Stardew Valley and feel like I&#39;ve not really progressed much in those and still have lots to do i
