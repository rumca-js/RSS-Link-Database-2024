## How to Solve Negative Worst Hold Slack for Open Source Core (RI5CY) on Xilinx Kria KV260

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am a uni student trying to set up an open source RISC-V core for my school project on a Kria KV260 board, and I am using the RTL files from this <a href="https://github.com/openhwgroup/cv32e40p?tab=readme-ov-file">github repo</a> on the CV32E40P/RI5CY. During synthesis, there is a negative worst-hold-slack (WHS) and the paths listed are between the original RTL module registers, which confuses me as I had initially thought (naively) that setting up a tried and tested open-source core would be easier and also any problems would be from my own modifications. Additionally, I cannot find a Kria KV260 XDC constraint file so I am really in the dark here. </p> <p>Does anyone have any suggestions with regards to solving this? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/crdl2crdl"> /u/crdl2crdl </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1g79aws/how_to_solve_negative_worst_hold_slack_for_open/
