For it to come against Arteta – who grew up playing for the same youth team in San Sebastián – made it particularly sweet. But with Bukayo Saka having not made the trip to the south coast, Arsenal had looked short of inspiration even before Saliba’s red card swung the balance of the game.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/19/bournemouth-arsenal-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

Her most recent book of short stories, <em>Concerning the Future of Souls</em>: <em>99 Stories of Azrael</em> (Tuskar Rock), was published earlier this year. Her work ranges from the philosophical examination of being, belief and morality to urgent engagements with environmental catastrophe; <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jun/22/james-salter">James Salter</a> wrote of her that she belongs in the company of Céline and Flannery O’Connor.

<p>Not since the 20th century have Aston Villa claimed this many points from their first eight Premier League games. They eventually finished sixth that season, but did not do anything so outrageous as beat Bayern Munich along the way. When will the Unai Emery era reach its ceiling?</p><p>There is little sign of it doing so at the moment, with Villa sticking resolutely to the heels of the division’s dominant trio, while racking up Champions League wins to boot. Since losing to Arsenal at the back end of August, Emery’s team have now strung together a nine-game unbeaten run in all competitions, this latest win coming at the expense of a Fulham side whose supporters’ thoughts had prematurely begun to wander towards potential European football of their own next season, so impressive was their own early-season form.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/19/fulham-aston-villa-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A new book of classic but simple recipes makes solo cooking more pleasure than chore</p><p>Like many people, I read a lot during the Covid-19 lockdown, and one of the books I enjoyed most in those strange, silent months was a memoir by the novelist Michèle Roberts called <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/may/18/negative-capability-by-michele-roberts-review-the-novelists-wisdom-casts-a-spell">Negative Capability</a></em>: an account of being alone, but not lonely. In the face of what people on social media like to call (ugh) self-care, Roberts wrote of her efforts to be good to herself after a painful rejection without recourse either to self-pity or to yoga. Four years on, I still sometimes pull it from the shelf when I’m feeling embattled. Radiant and meditative, a few pages are all I need to get going again; to remind myself to pay attention to everything, and by doing so both to recognise and to give thanks for what great good fortune I have.</p><p>I was, then,

<p>In the early 1980s, while working as an apprentice animator at Disney, a young Tim Burton channelled his creative energies into personal projects. One of these was this series of extravagantly decorated numbers, created for an unpublished children’s book; they were later repurposed as chapter headings for <a href="https://www.timburton.com/merchandise/taotb">The Art of Tim Burton</a> , a 2009 book bringing together 40 years of his artistry. “Anthropomorphic creatures feature heavily across Burton’s work,” says Maria McLintock, curator of a new exhibition displaying more than 600 Tim Burton designs and objects including costumes and storyboards. “He sketches voraciously, often engrossed in a pocket-sized sketchbook with a small watercolour kit in tow. The genesis of almost every shot in his films is a drawing.”</p><ul><li><a href="https://designmuseum.org/exhibitions/the-world-of-tim-burton">The World of Tim Burton is at the Design Museum, London, 25 October to 21 April 2025</a></li

<p>Make this chicken alla diavola, then use the leftovers for a Vietnamese salad, a spinach curry and a shawarma pitta. Plus inspiration for five more dishes</p><p>My most typed Google inquiry? Roast chicken recipes. As irresistible as a golden-hued, crisp-skinned roast chicken is, I often feel like I should occasionally break away from its perfect clutches. The recipe opposite is the one I go to. Its three types of chilli heat conspire to create a warmth that tingles rather than blows your head off and makes a rich, chickeny, spicy shallot sauce. And it gifts you the most brilliant leftovers as the meat is already infused with so much character.</p><p>When I’ve had a long week and can’t think what to cook, I&nbsp;find leftover chicken waiting in the fridge is what saves me. I’ll&nbsp;buy the biggest bird I can find, and always the highest possible quality I can afford. I’ll roast it at the weekend (ideally having bathed it in a 5%&nbsp;brine with a few herbs such as thyme or rosemary

<p>Rob Edwards badly needed a result after Luton’s shoddy start to the season and his team delivered with a dominant performance in an emphatic derby victory. A hangover following last season’s relegation from the Premier League resulted in two wins from nine Championship matches - their worst start to an EFL campaign for 22 years - but Luton rose to the occasion to outmuscle Watford.</p><p>The hosts pounced for the opener through Jordan Clark’s close-range flick and the outstanding Carlton Morris marked his return to the team by heading in early in the second half before a stoppage-time goal from Jacob Brown completed this mismatch. Watford started the weekend in sixth but Luton made a mockery of this flattering position with Tom Cleverley’s team second best throughout.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/19/luton-watford-championship-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

Emirates Team New Zealand won the ninth race and with it the match, 7-2. It means Team New Zealand, and their skipper, Peter Burling, are the first crew in modern history to win the Cup three times in succession, and that Britain’s 173-year wait to win the Auld Mug will go on for who knows how long. “A huge thank you to our team, and to everyone who supported us,” said the Ineos Britannia skipper, Ben Ainslie, “and a huge congratulations to New Zealand, in my view they’re the best team ever in the America’s Cup.”</p><p>Ainslie had promised to fight all the way, and was as good as his word.

Ah, good news: they’ve got reformed Oscar host Billy Crystal, and he’s starring in and executive producing Before, a psychological thriller (out Friday). Crystal plays Eli – which already puts me on edge as no character is ever called “Eli” unless the whole thing is a biblical allegory or there’s some ancient, unknowable horror going on, and in this case it’s the latter – who is grieving the recent death of his wife, Lynn. While doing that, he meets an unnerving child, Noah (Jacobi Jupe), who sees visions, speaks in tongues and keeps turning up at Eli’s house in the middle of the night in a way that no one seems to find weird but me.
