NASA’s Perseverance rover has made a bizarre discovery on Mars: a rock that strikingly resembles a human head. Captured on 27 September 2024, the image showcases the rock's peculiar shape and orientation, which play tricks on our brains, a phenomenon known as pareidolia. This occurrence leads us to see familiar patterns, like faces, in random objects. While the rock may appear eerie, it's simply a weathered piece of sedimentary sandstone. Despite many intriguing finds, there is still no evidence of complex life on Mars, as humanity prepares for future missions to explore the red planet further.

## How Rainwater Helped Stabilise Early Cells, Enabling Life's Complexity on Earth

Recent research led by Aman Agrawal, in collaboration with experts from the University of Chicago and University of Houston, uncovers the potential role rainwater played in stabilising protocells on early Earth. Their findings show how this helped prevent RNA leakage and uncontrolled mixing, allowing the formation of stable genetic material. This natural stabilisation was key to the evolution of more complex life forms. The study highlights the significance of rainwater in the early stages of life’s development, leading to the diversity we see today

## Animal Life Discovered Underground Near Hydrothermal Vents in the Deep Pacific Seabed

Recent deep-sea explorations have unveiled a remarkable ecosystem thriving beneath the Pacific Ocean's floor. Scientists deployed a remotely operated vehicle to investigate hydrothermal vent sites along the East Pacific Rise, where two tectonic plates diverge. Beneath the seafloor, they discovered cavities harboring giant tubeworms—the largest worms known—as well as snails and bristle worms. These organisms, previously observed only on the seafloor's surface, were found living underground for the first time. This groundbreaking discovery reveals that hydrothermal vent ecosystems extend into the Earth's crust, highlighting a previously unknown connectivity between surface and subsurface marine life.

## Astronomers Confirm Brown Dwarf Gliese 229B as Twin Pair Orbiting in 12 Days

Scientists have discovered that Gliese 229B, the first brown dwarf discovered 30 years ago, is actually two brown dwarfs orbiting close to each other. This unexpected find was made using the Very Large Telescope in Chile, solving a long-standing puzzle about the object's dim appearance. The twins, Gliese 229Ba and Gliese 229Bb, orbit each other in just 12 days, much faster than other similar objects. This discovery, published in Nature, suggests there could be many more hidden brown dwarf pairs in space.

## Can Diamond Dust Help Cool Earth? Exploring Costs and Geoengineering Risks

A study by Sandro Vattioni explores using 5 million tons of diamond dust annually to reduce global warming by 1.6ºC. Diamonds outperform sulfur in reflecting sunlight, but the method comes with an enormous price tag—$175 trillion. Despite its potential, experts like Douglas MacMartin question its feasibility due to costs, while others debate the overall risks of geoengineering. However, proponents argue that such research is essential in addressing climate change.
