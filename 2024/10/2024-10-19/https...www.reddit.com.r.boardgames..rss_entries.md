But lately, I’ve been hearing people say, &#39;It’s just an abstract with a pasted-on theme.&#39; Isn&#39;t that true for most games, though? I mean, if you strip away the theme from almost any game, the mechanics still function just fine.</p> <p>I get that it&#39;s more of a genre label than a technical definition, but I&#39;m curious—where do you draw the line between an abstract game and one that’s not?

Now the game&#39;s become pretty popular not only in our friendgroup but they all consistently play it with different friends or their family.

I don&#39;t want to rely on a third party for this though as this wouldn&#39;t fit in my budget so I was wondering if you guys could recommend me a printer or a method to produce these cards on my own that makes them look like your average &quot;high quality cards&quot; similar to UNO or poker cards. </p> <p>Thanks in advance for your help!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Actavium"> /u/Actavium

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone, I&#39;m here to ask you to help me remember the name of a specific board/card game I had as a kid, which I remember pretty much everything about except the name.</p> <p>I had it when I was about 9, so we&#39;re talking about a period around 2005-2008.</p> <p>I&#39;m from Italy and the game was available in local stores, but as often happens, it could be a translated version, so maybe it exists in English-speaking countries too.</p> <p>The game was based on Rock-Paper-Scissors, but with a leaf instead of Paper.</p> <p>Players took turns playing one of their cards to beat the one on the ground and finish their deck first.</p> <p>If the card being played had the same symbol as the one on the ground, it had to be a stronger color: Red &gt; Orange &gt; Green.</p> <p>Some cards had specific properties, such as the ability to give someone an extra card (and the other person had to say thank you) or to swap deck with another player.</p> <p>Then t

## Trick takers. Claiming a hand.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Ii had an interesting experience recently. We were playing a trick taker and I had the rest of the hand won and nobody could stop me so I laid down my hand and claimed the win. I come from a bridge/500/hearts background where to not claim the hand would be considered poor form because you’re slowing the game down. </p> <p>Anyways, long story long, one of the players was upset that I hadn’t played out the hand trick by trick. So my question/query is what’s the de rigueur here. Given the proliferation of trick takers recently and the number of new trick taker players should one claim tricks/ hands?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Salamander-7142S"> /u/Salamander-7142S </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1g73vca/trick_takers_claiming_a_hand/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1g73vca/trick_takers_claiming_a_hand/">[c

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I just had a test-run of a campaign game (Familiar Tales) which I was invited to do. Game in question is not actually that complex, think of Stuffed Fables or Mice and Mystics. It&#39;s basically a story oriented dungeon crawler (more story than game) which operates with this deck-building mechanic.</p> <p>Anyways, rules were told and right from that moment things are already fuzzy (the owner has played the enitre campaign btw). This is pretty normal and I don&#39;t blame people for not being clear with the rules the first time, this is why you ask follow up questions. And just to clarify I&#39;m pretty forgiving usually with the rules, I didn&#39;t want everything laid down, some rules are better explained as the game goes. I was asking very basic stuff like how does the turn structure go, when do we use the app, etc. What irked me the most is that almost every answer I got has a &quot;maybe&quot; attached at the end of it. Rulebook was barely touche
