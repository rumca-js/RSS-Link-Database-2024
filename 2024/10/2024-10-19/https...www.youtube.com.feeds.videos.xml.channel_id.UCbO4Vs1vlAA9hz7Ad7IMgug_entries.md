Operation Sandtrap is NOT a new 2-Player Starter Set. It's a battle-box with fourteen new models for the Infinity N5 Edition of Corvus Belli's landmark Science Fiction game. With rules launching on November 18th, this box along with the Quickstart rules and profiles allows for a neat preview of what N5 will be like. 

Big thanks to my Patrons for the opportunity to grab the advance copy of the models to review.
