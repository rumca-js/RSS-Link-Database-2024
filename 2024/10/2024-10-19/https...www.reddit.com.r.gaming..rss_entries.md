You can’t really play the game a second time, as everything falls into place in the end. I have yet to find another game with such a deep puzzle, where you have to take absolutely everything into consideration to solve a big puzzle… don’t really know how to explain it. Does anyone know any similar games, with puzzles that are actually hard and you have to theorycraft to get to the end?</p> </div><

And throughout these levels, scattered around are completely immersion breaking metal boxes and cans, deep in the forest for some reason, specifically in the path you need to travel.</li> <li>Inhalers last for 200+ uses in real life.
