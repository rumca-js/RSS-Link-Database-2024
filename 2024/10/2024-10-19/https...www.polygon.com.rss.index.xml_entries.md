<p class="has-drop-cap has-text-align-none">With his blood-soaked tales of violence and vengeance like <em>The Night Comes for Us </em>and <em>Headshot</em>, Timo Tjahjanto earned a reputation as one of the world’s goriest action directors. But he doesn’t see himself that way.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Tjahjanto began his filmmaking career making slasher movies as half of the Mo brothers, teaming up with his longtime friend Kimo Stamboel. Since the end of their formal partnership, the Mo brothers have largely worked on their own projects, with Stamboel working in the horror genre and Tjahjanto primarily (but not exclusively) making violent action movies. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s hard to remember what watching the first season of <em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/stranger-things">Stranger Things</a> </em>was like. Years later, with a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/stranger-things/24198919/stranger-things-season-5-teaser-bts">final season pending</a> (<a href="https://www.polygon.com/23191823/everything-we-know-stranger-things-5">and pending</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/stranger-things/23195085/stranger-things-season-5-length-shorter-episodes">and pending</a>—), the show has become a cultural juggernaut; the way it brought D&amp;D terms to the f

<p class="has-drop-cap has-text-align-none">I love driving. I love the physical act of it — controlling this big, sophisticated machine like it’s an extension of me. But I also love the poetry and adventure of long-distance drives — the freedom, the self-reliance, the gradually changing landscape, the sense of limitless possibilities.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Video games are fantastic at capturing the first of these things, in Gran Turismo and countless other racing games. Sometimes, they try to do both things at once. Open-world driving games like <em>Forza Horizon</em> deliver a compressed and heightened dose of the pleasures of the road trip, while the Truck Simulator series offers a
