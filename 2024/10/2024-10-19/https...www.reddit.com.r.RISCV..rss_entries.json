During synthesis, there is a negative worst-hold-slack (WHS) and the paths listed are between the original RTL module registers, which confuses me as I had initially thought (naively) that setting up a tried and tested open-source core would be easier and also any problems would be from my own modifications. Additionally, I cannot find a Kria KV260 XDC constraint file so I am really in the dark here. </p> <p>Does anyone have any suggestions with regards to solving this? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/crdl2crdl\"> /u/crdl2crdl </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1g79aws/how_to_solve_negative_worst_hold_slack_for_open/", "id": 1353224, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1g79aws/how_to_solve_negative_worst_hold_slack_for_open", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 471, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "How to Solve Negative Worst Hold Slack for Open Source Core (RI5CY) on Xilinx Kria KV260", "vote": 0}]
