<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I need to follow a feed, but the format of it is weird. It offers a useless summary in the actual feed item content itself, but within the &lt;description&gt; tag of each item, there&#39;s a link to the actual PDF. </p> <p>I need some way of getting at those links. </p> <p>The most simple way is just to open the feed URL in browser, copy the entire contents, and use regex to extract those. Easy enough. </p> <p>But of course the feed XML only includes the most recent 10 items. I need some way of following the feed where the raw feed data of each item is accessible, and not just the normal content. So far this seems impossible as every feed reader I&#39;ve tried formats items in its own way and ends up stripping anything in the &lt;description&gt; out. </p> <p>Is there any way of having each new &lt;item&gt; of a feed saved, the entire code between the opening and closing &lt;item&gt; tags? Even something like having each new item appended to a plaintex
