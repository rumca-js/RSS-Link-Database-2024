<p><a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3484345/google-unveils-flutter-gpu-api-dart-updates.html">Flutter,</a> the Google-led development environment for building multi-device UIs from a single codebase, has been forked. The intention behind the fork is to expand Flutter’s available labor and accelerate development, said developer Matt Carroll.</p>



<p>In an October 27  <a href="https://flutterfoundation.dev/blog/posts/we-are-forking-flutter-this-is-why/">Flutter Foundation blog post</a>, Carroll described himself as a former member of the Flutter team. On X (formerly Twitter), Carroll is also described as <a href="https://x.com/suprdeclarative">chief  of Flutter bounty hunters</a>, a “Flu

<p>Saving even a few keystrokes is worth quite a bit to enterprise developers, and to assist with that, Amazon Tuesday rolled out an updated version of its genAI-powered in-IDE chat capabilities that brings the AI-suggested code and documentation directly into the code editor, as opposed to having it appear in a separate window from which it then has to be cut and pasted into the program. It is available within the Visual Studio Code and JetBrains integrated development environments (IDEs).</p>



<p>“Amazon Q Developer announces an enhanced chat experience that allows you to seamlessly initiate chat within the inline coding experience,” said the brief <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/wha

<p>As we all learned in history class in high school, the Industrial Revolution gave birth to machine-driven manufacturing processes that greatly increased production, lowered the costs of manufactured goods, and raised everyone’s standard of living. It even changed how society was structured, as it massively expanded the middle class, and brought home the idea that technology could improve our lives. </p>



<p>One of the changes that the Industrial Revolution brought about was how we worked. The notion of economies of scale led to larger and larger factories. As things moved forward, we realized that productivity could be measured easily. Workers screwing the caps on toothpaste tubes could be re

<p>React’s development team has been quietly working on a compiler to improve the default performance of applications that rely on React. The goal is a compiler that comprehends both JavaScript and React and outputs optimized versions of both; a major undertaking. Word is the compiler is no longer a research project and has been deployed to Instagram in production. That means it’s time for React developers to check out the new compiler and understand how it works.</p>

<p>By default, Python’s runtime executes in a single thread, with traffic directed by the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL). Most of the time this isn’t a significant bottleneck, but it becomes one when you want to run many jobs in parallel.</p>



<p>Python provides two ways to work around this issue: <em>threading</em> and <em>multiprocessing</em>. Each approach allows you to break a long-running job into parallel batches, which you can work on side-by-side. Depending on the job in question, you can sometimes speed up operations tremendously. At the very least, you can treat tasks in such a way that they don’t block other work while they wait to be completed.</p>
