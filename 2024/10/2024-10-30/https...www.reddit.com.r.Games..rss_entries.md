## In an attempt to win back players, WB Games has added $30 skins to MultiVersus that are gone forever once its Halloween event ends.

If you don&#39;t cough up $60 during the event then they are gone forever.</p> <p>It&#39;s really unfortunate that this game still has so many issues yet they&#39;ve decided to add FOMO to the game which happens to also be quite expensive. This game is treated worse than a mobile game when it could be as good as Smash if it had any effort and love put into it.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submi
