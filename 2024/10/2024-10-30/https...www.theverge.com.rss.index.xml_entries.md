  <p id="romHzw">Nothing is more frustrating than buying a new pair of headphones, an OLED TV, or a laptop just to find out that you could have gotten it for a lot cheaper somewhere else. That’s why, in order to keep customers happy and prevent them from going elsewhere, many retailers offer price-matching policies in which they promise to match a lower price found elsewhere. That kind of information comes in handy no matter the time of year, but it’s especially helpful during shopping events like Black Friday and Cyber Monday.</p>

  <p id="YuRDDZ">Meta is “working with the public sector to adopt Llama across the US government,” according to CEO Mark Zuckerberg. </p>
<p id="50jWqu">The comment, made during his opening remarks for Meta’s Q3 earnings call on Wednesday, raises a lot of important questions: Exactly which parts of the government will use Meta’s AI models? What will the AI be used for? Will there be any kind of military-specific applications of Llama? Is Meta getting paid for any of this? </p>
<p id="WZ2y7o">When I asked Meta to elaborate, spokesperson Jon Carvill declined to comment beyond Zuckerberg’s brief remark to investors.
