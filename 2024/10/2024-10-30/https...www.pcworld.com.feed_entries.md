<p>Firefox launched long ago on November 9, 2004, which means we’re just over one week out from the browser’s 20th anniversary. Who knew that a spiritual successor to Netscape Navigator would last this long?</p>



<p>With <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/132.0/releasenotes/">Firefox 132 being released yesterday</a>, it’s close enough to count as a celebration — and the update fittingly brings some good news with it, including improved privacy with blocked third-party cookies, plus some other cool features worth updating for.</p>



<p>Mozilla plans to release Firefox 133 on November 26, 2024.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading toc" id="whats-new-in-firefox-132">What’s new in Firefox 132?</h2>

<p>It may look like a flash drive and act like a flash drive, but it’s actually a portable SSD. The SK Hynix Tube T31 is lightweight, compact, and perfect for everyday use — and it’s on sale.</p>



<p>Right now, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SK-hynix-1000MB-External-Compatible/dp/B0CQZCWHTQ/">this 1TB portable SSD is only $62 on Amazon</a>, which is a hefty 31 percent discount off its usual $90 price tag. It also happens to be the <strong>best price we’ve seen</strong> for this powerful storage drive.</p>



<p>When <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2257928/sk-hynix-tube-t31-review.html">we reviewed the SK Hynix Tube T31</a>, we gave it a 4.5-star rating and our Editors’ Choice award, appreciating how fast it is and how small it is. “SK Hynix’s Tube T31 looks like a standard Type-A USB thumb drive but performs more like the external SSD it actually

<p>Do you know how rare it is for us to give any product a clean 5-star rating? It happens maaaaybe twice per year, if that.</p>



<p>Well, it certainly happened with the Logitech G502 Lightspeed wireless gaming mouse, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Lightspeed-PowerPlay-Compatible-Lightsync/dp/B07L4BM851/">the very same mouse that’s on sale for $88 at Amazon</a>, down from its original $150 price. (That’s 41 percent off!)</p>



<p>Not only did <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/397404/logitech-g502-lightspeed-review.html">this gaming mouse earn a perfect score in our review</a>, but it also secured our Editors’ Choice award. Our reviewing expert praised how comfortable it is to use and how lightweight it is. Plus, it has a battery life that lasts about 60 hours on a full charge.</p>

<p>On the whole, I don’t think you should buy a Windows laptop with less than 16GB of RAM — but I <em>do</em> think you should buy a dirt-cheap laptop if you can make some easy upgrades. It’s a great way to get a decent laptop at a bargain-bin price.</p>



<p>And now’s your chance to do that because right now <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/asus-vivobook-14-laptop-intel-core-i3-1215u-with-8gb-memory-128gb-ssd-quiet-blue/6568805.p?skuId=6568805">this upgradeable Asus Vivobook 14 is on sale for just $210 at Best Buy</a>. That’s a whopping $220 off its original $430 price, a 51 percent discount.</p>



<p>The Vivobook X1404ZA is a pretty decent deal at this price, with a 12th-gen Intel Core i3 processor, 8GB of RAM, and an admittedly small 128GB SSD for storage. It’s a good basic machine for browsing the web, watching video, and maybe playing very low-po

<p>The Samsung Odyssey OLED G9 is easily one of the most powerful ultrawide gaming monitors that money can buy right now. While usually rather expensive, with an MSRP of $1,800, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Processor-DisplayHDR-FreeSync-LS49CG954SNXZA/dp/B0C48D7Q22/">the 49-inch monitor is now on sale for $1,080 at Amazon</a>, a fantastic 40 percent discount.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2040013/samsung-odyssey-oled-g9-review.html">our review of the OLED G9</a>, we gave it a 4.5-star rating and our Editors’ Choice award. We felt the monitor delivers an incredible sense of gaming presence thanks to its ultrawide 5120×1440 resolution screen, while its fast refresh rate and response time made it ideal for high-octane action.</p>



<p>Our expert reviewer was referring, of course, to the OLED G9’s 240Hz refresh rate and jaw-dr

<p>As any lawyer will tell you, a law doesn’t necessarily have to make sense, or be in any way enforceable, to be on the books.</p>



<p>Following some legal back-and-forth resulting from the restrictions of Russian media channels on YouTube, a Russian court has presented Google with a fine of 2 undecillion rubles. That’s approximately 20,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 US dollars.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/10/29/russian_court_fines_google/">As The Register points out</a>, this is a ludicrous amount of money. It’s about 200 trillion times the current estimated amount of “liquid” monetary value, in all currencies from all countries, currently in circulation on the planet. (I think I got that right. It’s a lot of zeroes.) The total was apparently reached after accounting for 17 Russian TV channels that were removed from Y

<p>After updating Windows 11 to the latest 24H2 version, some PCs are experiencing problems with network and internet connections. It appears that the DHCP feature in Windows 11 is no longer working properly.</p>



<p>In simple terms, the Dynamic Host Control Protocol (DHCP) is one way to automatically assign IP addresses to devices on a network. But after the 24H2 update, this process appears to be broken. The issue could also be that while the DHCP server properly assigns IP addresses to devices, the DHCP server itself has a problematic address.</p>



<p>In this article, we show you some tricks to solve the problem. If these tips don’t work, you can try <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2502695/windows-11-24h2-causing-problems-how-to-return-to-a-previous-version.html">reverting to a previous Windows version</a>.</p>

<p>Chrome is the most popular browser on the planet, but even its most ardent fans will admit that this thing gobbles up memory like an Olympic swimmer chomping down protein bars.</p>



<p>Google has tried various methods over the years to slim down its memory footprint, but the newest Performance Detection feature might finally make it a lot more effective.</p>



<p>According to a <a href="https://blog.google/products/chrome/google-chrome-performance-controls-october-2024/">blog post</a>, Performance Detection “proactively identifies potential performance issues and offers solutions.” How, exactly? It’ll tell you which tabs are hogging memory and processor cycles, then give you a one-click option to deactivate them. They won’t disappear — they’ll just stop actively loading. Simple but effective, I suppose.</p>

<p>A lot of raw materials and energy are used to produce a printer. The longer the device is in use, the better in terms of sustainability. </p>



<p>With a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Raspberry-Pi-SC1111-5-4Gb/dp/B0CK3L9WD3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Raspberry Pi</a>, you can indirectly make older printers network-compatible and also enable printing via a wireless network using a smartphone, for example.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading toc" id="what-requirements-apply">What requirements apply</h2>



<p>The printer should at least have a USB interface so that it can work with a Raspberry Pi. </p>



<p>It also makes sense to find out on the internet whether there are current Linux drivers for the printer. If the device works smoothly on a Linux desktop system, it will also work perfectly in the new constellation.</p>
