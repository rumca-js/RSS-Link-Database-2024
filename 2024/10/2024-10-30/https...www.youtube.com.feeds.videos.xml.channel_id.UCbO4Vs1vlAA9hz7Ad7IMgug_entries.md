WELCOME TO SPEARHEADZ! This casual gaming series is going to explore Warhammer's new format of fixed-list casual gaming. This wide-onramp new system for playing Games Workshop's cosmic-fantasy wargame is perfect for the kitchen-table game crowd and is perfectly suited for where I'm at with gaming. 

Today the fourth SPEARHEAD to finish his boxed set is Chris! He's throwing down against my Stormcast with his Disciples of Tzeentch!
