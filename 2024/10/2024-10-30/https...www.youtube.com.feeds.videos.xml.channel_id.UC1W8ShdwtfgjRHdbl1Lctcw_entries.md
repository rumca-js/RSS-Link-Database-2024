I colorized, restored and created a sound design for this video of street scenes in Chicago, Illinois, in the early 1950s. You can see what's going on in the middle of winter, the old cars, the buildings, the people and the winter activities.

Video Restoration Process:
✔ FPS boosted to 60 frames per second 
✔ Image resolution boosted up to HD 
✔ Improved video sharpness and brightness 
✔ Colorized only for the ambiance (not historically accurate)
✔added sound only for the ambiance
✔restoration:(stabilisation,denoise,cleand,deblur) 

Please, be aware that colorization colors are not real and fake, colorization was made only for the ambiance and do not represent real historical data.
