Devlin had time and space to take a touch and hammer the ball high into the roof of the net, earning Aberdeen a reward for their strong start to the match.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/30/aberdeen-rangers-scottish-premiership-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Tottenham had threatened to win at a canter. Two goals up after 25 minutes, there was almost disbelief within the home crowd and not only because Timo Werner had scored the first.</p><p>Everybody knew this was not how the story would go and so we had the Manchester City fightback, Matheus Nunes pulling one back before half-time and then a concerted attempt by Spurs to seal the deal.

Cody Gakpo’s quickfire double helped the Liverpool manager make it seven wins from his first eight away matches in all competitions as the holders moved into the quarter-finals despite making wholesale changes on the south coast.</p><p>Slot could not have wished for a better start to life in English football and he will have been mightily impressed with the performance of the Czech goalkeeper Vitezslav Jaros, who made a spectacular save on his debut when the game was finely poised at 1-0. This was the first real setback for opposite number Fabian Hürzeler since his arrival on these shores, with Brighton once again failing to get past this stage of the competition for the first time in approaching 50 years.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/30/brighton-liverpool-carabao-cup-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

Ten minutes before the largely pointless prime minister’s questions began there were still plenty of seats free on the opposition side of the chamber.

Staging Leoncavallo’s Pagaliacci for their SmallStages tour is in itself a miracle of resistance and resilience – thanks in part to 11th-hour financial lifelines and public donations – and the opera’s story of a group of travelling players, the clowns of the title, and the emotional turmoil behind the greasepaint, feels singularly appropriate.</p><p>The staging may be scaled to the bare minimum – a central dais has a metal frame decorated with lantern-lights – yet its concept is loving homage to the commedia dell’arte tradition and its stock characters of Pierrot, Colombine and Harlequin.

<p>It started as a spooky suburban attraction – and ended up leaving visitors injured and deeply traumatised. A new podcast takes a deep dive into the darkness</p><p>It all seemed like an innocent bit of fun. In the early 2000s, Russ McKamey and his then wife Carol went on TV to explain that they were spending $30,000 to make Halloween at their home bigger and better than anyone else’s. Fans queued around the block of the quiet San Diego suburb to experience fake blood, spooky props and teenage actors giving them jump scares. Until, that is, things got much, much darker.</p><p>By 2012, participants were being waterboarded, chained up in boxes and almost buried alive after McKamey decided to make McKamey Manor a more extreme, kid-free zone. “I was seeing people come out shaking uncontrollably … one guy, it looked like his nose was broken; another burst a blood vessel in his eye – it was full of blood,” says Mercedes Ann, a certified lifeguard with basic first aid training who was ther

<p>Lowriding cars are synonymous with rap, but their Chicano drivers prefer sweet soul music. The scene’s movers and musicians explain how they went from being police targets to esteemed cultural cornerstones</p><p>‘Low rider knows every street,” chanted War on Low Rider, their 1975 hymn to the customised cars of east and south central Los Angeles whose suspension had been chopped down to allow them to run “slow and low”. Later, Black LA films (Boyz n the Hood) and music videos (Snoop Dogg, Dr Dre) prominently featured lowriders, the camera passing lovingly over the cars’ customised paint jobs and hydraulic systems that allowed them to bounce. But the lowrider was actually invented by LA’s Mexican-American Chicano community after the second world war – and their drivers didn’t listen to rap, but “lowrider soul”, elegiac R&amp;B songs that remain their preferred soundtrack for cruising.</p><p>Lowrider soul constitutes a paradox: lovelorn ballads aren’t what you might expect these ofte

<p>Black and white re-release of one of the fire-breathing lizard’s best outings looks terrific and has an intriguingly ambiguous human lead actor</p><p>It’s 70 years since Godzilla first stomped into cinemas, and the big lad has barely aged a day. He’s the Cher of movie monsters: constant reinvention, permanent icon status (even in his ropier moments), while never being afraid to play the hits and give the people what they want. Which in Godzilla’s case is a big fire-breathing lizard smooshing skyscrapers to rubble while the people below flee like ants.

<p>In his latest book, Disaster Nationalism, the Marxist thinker explores how extremist movements around the world seek to blame fictional enemies for real disasters</p><p>Like a lot of people, Richard Seymour, 47, was trying to quietly ignore the climate crisis and get on with his life. As a prolific Marxist intellectual, this meant industriously writing about a range of subjects: the Iraq war, neoliberalism, the class struggle. The climate crisis could wait until after the revolution. Besides, he didn’t have the expertise or emotional capacity for it.</p><p>But in 2015 that changed. Walking in a local park on Christmas Day, he couldn’t ignore how noticeably warm it was. He started to think about not just what has already been lost but what global heating means for the losses to come. “Some sort of defence just went down,” he says, “and I experienced a preliminary bit of climate mourning.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/oct/30/richard-seymour-on-far-right-

It is also reportedly one of the most haunted.

Now a tourist attraction, it occasionally opens to paying guests who want to spend a night behind bars.

<p>After decades of nomadic existence, the Polish capital’s art temple is open for permanent business in an inspirational, light-filled new building</p><p>When Poland joined the European Union 20 years ago, our world changed. I was a student in Warsaw, and spent my savings on a train ticket to Berlin – not for migrant work, but to see the 200 masterpieces at the <a href="https://www.smb.museum/en/museums-institutions/neue-nationalgalerie/home/">Neue Nationalgalerie</a> on loan from the New York <a href="https://www.moma.org/">Museum of Modern Art</a>.</p><p>In 2017, ahead of a stint working in Silicon Valley, I rushed to the <a href="https://www.sfmoma.org/">San Francisco Museum of Modern Art</a>.

## Midas Man review – Jacob Fortune-Lloyd is heartfelt as Beatles’ kingmaker

<p>As the ‘fifth Beatle’ Brian Epstein, Fortune-Lloyd’s performance holds an otherwise sanitised narrative together in well-meaning biopic</p><p>British actor Jacob Fortune-Lloyd stars as the Beatles’ manager Brian Epstein in this uneven but well-meaning biopic. The screenplay by Brigit Grant and Jonathan Wakeham weaves the story in and around the two or three main facets of Epstein that are always invoked in every potted bio: he was instrumental in the Beatles’ huge international success (Paul McCartney would later describe him as “the fifth Beatle”), he was Jewish, and he was gay. It certainly unfurls itself on a broader canvas than the 1991 drama <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_hours_and_times/reviews">The Hours and Times</a>, although that tight, intimate low-budget work, which featured David Angus as Epstein and a young Ian Hart as John Lennon on a weekend trip to Barcelona together, still stands up as one of the most nuanced and insightful works of Beatles-themed

<p>How can anyone cope with the loss of their pregnancies? When I watched Tahlequah the whale grieve her calf and go on to have another, it gave me unexpected hope</p><p>It was winter 2018. I had just miscarried my twins. Technically, I had failed to miscarry them and had to have not one, not two, but three surgical procedures under general anaesthetic to “extract the retained products of conception”. Each time I ended up back in hospital with severe pains or heavy bleeding, the doctors would scan me, express their surprise that there was still some “tissue” remaining in my uterus and schedule another surgery.</p><p>Just over six weeks after learning about our loss, I was feeling absolutely dreadful, once again in hospital and still testing positive for a pregnancy. The whole experience was surreal. But there was something about it that made complete sense to me: my body was no more ready to let go than my mind was. I was still holding on to my babies in every way I could.</p> <a hre

Kemi Badenoch, prospective leader of the Conservative party, described the argument for reparations as a “<a href="https://x.com/GBNEWS/status/1847003271224811731">scam</a>”, and urged people not to “fall for it”.
