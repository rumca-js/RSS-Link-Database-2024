Bimotal Elevate turns a pedal bike into an e-bike with just a cellphone-sized device. Toby Ricco developed the product so he could keep mountain biking after he recovered from tearing cartilage in his left knee. Elevate is a $1,995 palm-sized motor with 750 watts of power&#8212;enough to produce 75 Newton-meters of torque&#8212;that clips onto the&#8230;

Graham Dugoni believes that &#8220;society needs protected spaces&#8221; from cellphones. That&#8217;s why in 2014 he founded Yondr, which makes pouches into which phones can be locked away for a certain amount of time&#8212;such as during a concert or theater show&#8212;allowing their owners to disconnect. His vision was a world away from that of boosterish executives&#8230;

## Water From the Sky

Potable water is becoming an ever scarcer resource, even though our atmosphere is laden with 38 million-billion gallons of the wet stuff. Tapping it is the tricky part. Aquaria does so using large-scale heat exchange systems, which suck air in and pass it through multiple filters. The humidity is condensed out of the air and&#8230;

Cramming 40 acres of farmland into one acre in its Texas greenhouses, indoor vertical farmer Eden Green this year grew and shipped a full suite of ten herbs out of a single facility, where each herb has its own micro-climate. The typical herbs found in a supermarket (like basil, parsley, rosemary, chives, or mint) often&#8230;

In 2020, Keith Thomas dived into a pool, hit his head, and broke his neck. He was paralyzed from the chest down. Then, in a first-of-its-kind surgery last year, scientists implanted microchips into his brain to connect his thoughts to arm and hand movement, creating a two-way link&#8212;a &#8220;double bypass&#8221;&#8212;that allowed signals to travel in&#8230;

Traditionally, slacklining is for daredevils: You try to balance yourself on what looks like a not-so-tight tightrope, often slung between trees. The problem, of course, is that you can fall. So the Germany-based Gibbon created a super short and low slackline, attaching just over three feet of webbing to a wooden board. The wood&#8217;s natural&#8230;

When you set up a Haikubox in your backyard, it automatically listens for birds, records their songs, identifies the species (using AI-powered audio pattern recognition), and then, via Wi-Fi, shares this information to a website for bird-watching enthusiasts. The corded device gives birdwatchers a handy tool to keep track of every bird that nears their&#8230;

Traditional posture monitors use a gyroscope to track the position you&#8217;re holding your body in while sitting, but they&#8217;re unable to assess dynamic form during exercise. The BackAware Belt, on the other hand, can handle motion. The wearable tech uses two sensors that calibrate to your spine; a one-time setup recognizes your starting posture, then&#8230;

## Clearer Dental X-Rays

Dental X-rays can be tricky for patients&#8212;especially kids&#8212;to understand, as the gray blobs of a cavity can look similar to the gray blobs of a healthy tooth. And if the patient is confused, then complying with the dentist&#8217;s instructions (like wearing a mouthguard) is less likely. So the FDA-cleared Overjet uses AI to create a&#8230;

## Therapy for Spinal Cord Injuries

Over 250,000 people in the U.S. alone live with spinal cord injuries. To help patients regain sensation and strength in their hands and arms, Onward Medical&#8217;s ARC-EX therapy uses electrical stimulation&#8212;applied externally with electrodes&#8212;to effectively boost the brain&#8217;s signals. A study in Nature showed that nine out of 10 patients using ARC-EX recovered some strength&#8230;

Most snowboards are made, in part, from a plastic called polyethylene, which comes from petroleum. So to demonstrate that they could be made more sustainably, Wndr designed the first snowboard made from microalgae&#8212;an oil produced through fermentation. On top of being eco-friendly, the microalgae was engineered to improve the Alpine Shepherd&#8217;s &#8220;damping,&#8221; meaning its ability&#8230;
