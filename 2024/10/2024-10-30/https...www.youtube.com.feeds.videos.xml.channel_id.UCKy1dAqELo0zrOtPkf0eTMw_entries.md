Life is Strange: Double Exposure reviewed by Nick Maillet on Xbox series X, also available on PlayStation 5 and PC.

After several attempts to recapture what made the original Life is Strange so enduring, developer Deck Nine Games really knocked it out of the park with Life is Strange: Double Exposure. This is a worthy sequel to a game that captured the hearts and minds of millions of people, myself included, way back in 2015. The writing is great, the music is excellent, the cinematography and acting are top-notch, and Max’s new powers are a fun and intuitive fit for its murder mystery structure.

Ask most people what The Blair Witch Project’s about, and you’ll get some variation on “a group of student filmmakers become lost in the woods and get hunted by a witch.” But The Blair Witch Project isn’t a movie about a witch stalking three filmmakers who are lost in the woods; it’s about three filmmakers who are lost in the woods and losing their minds. IGN's Tom Jorgensen explains how once you start to focus on that fact, The Blair Witch Project is really at its scariest in the bright light of day, even now, 25 years after it was released.
