The game is inspired by astrology and features epic boss battles against anime versions of the 12 zodiac signs. No two runs are the same. Insane build variety and really satisfying progression. 4 playable main characters each with a subset of 3 unique weapons that shake up the gameplay.</p> <p>I haven&#39;t played anything since Hades that gave me that feeling of unlocking cool things every time I fail a run. Best of all the game is constantly updating with free content like new weapons and maps that doesn&#39;t cost players anything. Truly insane value for the amount of time I sunk into it. </p> <p>It boggles the mind that more people don&#39;t know about this game and I truly believe it deserves it&#39;s own Hades m
