I have never really been interested in ghosts, mummies or zombies, not even at Halloween. But as October 31 approaches each year, I am reminded of a biological tale involving all three. It's the real-life horror story of a flesh-eating, brain-warping fungus from the genus Cordyceps, which inspired the zombie-apocalypse video game and "TV series The Last of Us."

Like most lakes in the world, Lake Geneva is an emitter of greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2). Annually, it produces as much CO2 as the automobile transport of the city of Lausanne (≃ 150,000 inhabitants). This phenomenon—the production of CO2 by lakes—has been known for years. There is, however, widespread debate as to the mechanisms at work.

Up close, each of these cell divisions is nothing short of a miracle. Within just a few hours, not only must the entire genome—billions of "letters" long—be replicated, but most other cellular structures must be doubled so that in the end, two complete daughter cells can emerge.

In today's update of their red list for Europe, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) is therefore categorizing the hedgehog as "near threatened." According to the IUCN, there is a real risk of the hedgehog being pushed towards extinction unless something is done to reverse the downward trend.

There is clearly giddy excitement in the shaky footage showing hands scrabbling in the soil in the Chew Valley in south-west England. A close-up shot captures someone pulling silver coin after silver coin from the churned earth as a woman laughs "there's pennies everywhere." The video accompanied news reports in 2019 of the monumental find by seven detectorists of a hoard of silver coins dating from the time of the Norman conquest in the 11th century.

Ecologists challenge this assumption in a review published October 30 in Trends in Ecology & Evolution. They argue that since ethanol is naturally present in nearly every ecosystem, it is likely consumed on a regular basis by most fruit- and nectar-eating animals.
