The Open Table Formats (OTFs) designed by Netflix (Apache Iceberg), Uber (Aache Hudi), and Databricks (Delta Lake) have made it possible to build a cloud-native data infrastructure capable of supporting all the datatypes needed for AI/ML. Commonly called a Data Lakehouse, this new platform disaggregates compute from storage and can scale out as capacity requirements change. 

This session will introduce the Data Lakehouse and show how it supports the specialized tooling needed for traditional AI, generative AI, distributed training, and MLOps. This talk concludes with some observations on Nvidiaâ€™s GPUs and provides recommendations for adopting GPUs.
