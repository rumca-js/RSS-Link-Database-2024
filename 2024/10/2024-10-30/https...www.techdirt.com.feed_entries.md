When the government shuts down a protest because both protesters and counter-protesters are physically attacking each other, it&#8217;s not a &#8220;heckler&#8217;s veto.&#8221; It&#8217;s just common sense, even though there was very little of that on display during the protest, nor during law enforcement&#8217;s belated response to the violent confrontation. But Warren Balogh thinks only his [&#8230;]

The open access movement has been trying for over 20 years to promote the widest access to knowledge. Sadly, as numerous Walled Culture posts have chronicled, what should be a matter of social justice has been subverted by clever and cynical moves from the academic publishing industry in order to retain their fabulous profit margins. As a [&#8230;]

What are the odds. Evolv, a gun detection tech firm contracted by the city of New York to handle fare jumping by scanning for guns, told everyone &#8212; including its investors &#8212; that deploying its tech in NYC subways wasn&#8217;t exactly a great idea. It made this statement even as Mayor Adams was telling people [&#8230;]

You may recall last December when we wrote about the somewhat shocking news that an Indian court had ordered Reuters to take down an entire article investigating a company, Appin and its founder Rajat Khare, that were accused of running a giant “hacking for hire” operation. Ten months later, that article is back online with [&#8230;]

To be very clear: SpaceX’s Starlink service can be a game changer for those completely out of range of broadband access.

It&#8217;s that time of the year in the Midwest, when the skies darken early and the temperature drops. And that means it&#8217;s pho season. As a lover of pho, allow me to educate anyone that hasn&#8217;t heard of it. It&#8217;s a soup of sorts, with rice noodles, spices, and meat. And it&#8217;s considered the national [&#8230;]
