After a decade of development and project restarts, the latest Dragon Age is finally here. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/whisper-it-but-dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-me-thinking-the-unthinkable-it-looks-like-bioware-is-back">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> is a direct sequel to 2014's Inquisition, and uses a dramatic evolution of that game's Frostbite technology, featuring ray tracing techniques and current-gen exclusivity. We've already covered the PC version and came away impressed with how the new release scales across a range of hardware, but where does that leave the consoles - especially the four teraflop Xbox Series S? And how have the game's ray tracing settings been adapted for console play?

Really, it should be the least scary horror game you ever play, as you know exactly what you're up against the moment you load it up. But nothing, I'd argue, quite prepares you for the sheer number of possibilities that exist within this abandoned and blooded nuclear facility, as this is a place with a truly obscene number of toilets inside it, and a worrying number of important items to find beneath their grimy, cobwebbed lids.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/in-toilet-spiders-there-sure-are-a-heck-of-a-lot-of-toilets-and-a-heck-of-a-lot-of-spiders">Read more</a></p>

It's a twisted and dreamy place of great magical power that people seek but which misleads and corrupts those who look for it. Anything that's happened in Dragon Age is linked to it, whether it's a hulking Archdemon from the Fade leading a Blight across the land, as in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dragon-age-origins">Dragon Age: Origins</a>, or if it's a mage with a Fade spirit inside them igniting a war as in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dragon-age-ii">Dragon Age 2</a>.
