It was printed on a school diary from around the mid 90s, each month had a sheet with a level of the game printed on it. It was an adventure game, like a role-playing game with traps, swamps, skeletons, monsters. By completing all the levels (accompanied by a somewhat bloody and dark story) you got the complete map.</p> <p>In one of these levels, it is said that children were sent to discover the underground floors of a mysterious structure, which became increasingly narrow, until they had to crawl. They were attached to ropes so that they would not get lost, but when they got stuck in these floors that were now too low, the rope was pulled from outside so as to break their backs and put an end to their suffering, so much so that it seems that their screams can still be heard.</p> <p>Do you have any ideas? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/

I like the idea of the cupholders but wanted to know if the magnetism in them is truly sturdy enough or if someone accidentally hitting with their elbow might knock it clean off.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>For folks who are fans of Volko Ruhnke&#39;s COIN series, one of the best of the series - A Distant Plain, set in post-US-invasion Afghanistan - is about to hit its preorder reprint pledge soon! Very soon, I&#39;m hoping. It was at 475 / 500 just two days ago and is at 479 right now. Hopefully it&#39;ll hit 500 within a couple weeks! </p> <p>Not only is this one of the best of the COIN series but it&#39;s one that&#39;s set in a fairly contemporary time, and I think it&#39;s great for anyone who seeks to understand why almost any military action is complicated and why anyone promising easy answers when they propose military action is either ignorant or is lying to you. Not a bad thing to gain an increased understanding of in these times, imho. </p> <p>Anyhoo anyone interested go hit that preorder now! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/RiotDad"> /u/RiotDad </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.redd

Each map presents natural resources and initial-level species, like insects, while other animals appear randomly to be allocated. The goal is to create a healthy ecosystem, avoiding overpopulation, resource scarcity, and extinctions.</p> <p>The mechanics include seasonal cycles that affect resources, environmental events that bring unexpected challenges, and migration behaviors and social interactions among species. The biome&#39;s diversity and the synergy between species, such as pollination and nutrient recycling, directly influence ecological balance. The player receives feedback and ale

## What was the board game from the 1990s where you and the other players work together to defeat the main enemy? I think there was an digital interface component in the center and you needed to equip 3 weapons to defeat the boss?

I remember each player&#39;s token had 3 spots where you could add equipment to your player and the only way to defeat the main enemy was to have all 3 weapons equipped and battle it?</p> <p>Or it may have had no such digital interface box, but there was something to keep track of the main enemy and you had to battle against it somehow, maybe by rolling dice?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>First off, <em>Glen More</em> is a great game, shout out to that one. But interestingly enough, more so than the rondel action selection or tile activation mechanism, the thing that intrigues me the most about that game is the goods market, and how the price fluctuates based on supply/demand. </p> <p>As players buy goods from the market, the cost of the good will increase for the next person who has to buy the same good. Similarly, if players sell a good to the market, the price for that good goes down.</p> <p>In <em>Glen More</em> it is mostly a tertiary effect as goods market trading often occurs as a free action, i.e., merely part of a larger &quot;turn&quot;. </p> <p>I&#39;m wondering, though, are there any games out there that use this mechanism more predominantly, to where it represents a much larger part of the gameplay/overall strategy? </p> <p>(Yes I suppose you could deem18xx a tangent of this, but I&#39;m going to explicitly rule out &quot
