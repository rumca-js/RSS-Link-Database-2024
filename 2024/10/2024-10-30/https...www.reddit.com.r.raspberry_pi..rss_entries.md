<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve got a Pi4 home server. Usually, it boots from an sdcard, but sometimes I boot it from usb. In the latter case, when there is no sdcard inserted, the green ACT led blinks regularly, like if there is some activity. I figured out it was due to sdcard polling (each 2 secs or so). To make it not blink, I use <code>dtparam=sd_poll_once</code> in my config.txt.</p> <p>Another home server is Pi3. The issue is <code>dtparam=sd_poll_once</code> makes the ACT led behave weird. On disk activity, it turns ON and keeps that way until there is no activity for like 30s. Like, if there is a cooldown to turn it off. When &quot;on cooldown&quot;, <code>iostat -d 2</code> shows no disk activity, but the led is ON.</p> <p>I noticed it after installing a fresh copy of armbian and setting things up, like I did on my Pi4, including <code>dtparam=sd_poll_once</code>. As soon as I commented out the sd_poll_once line in config.txt and rebooted, the led started blinkin

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have developed working software to shutdown and reboot an rpi with the geekworm x1202 hat. I am testing on a newly assembled device and something has changed. The i2c address is no 0x48 and not 0x36. Furthermore, the capacity and voltage readings using the geekworm example scripts on github and my own code based of these scripts are significantly off, seemingly by a factor of 2. Anyone have some insights? I have set the eeprom, etc. and this same code worked in the past.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Tricky_Condition_279"> /u/Tricky_Condition_279 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1gfy9u3/recent_geekworm_x1202_ups_does_not_work_with/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1gfy9u3/recent_geekworm_x1202_ups_does_not_work_with/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello,</p> <p>Has anybody tried to capture frames from the Arducam Mega and knows how fast its possible? the SPI speed is 8Mhz, so in theory with JPEG compression a framerate of &gt;10fps@1MP should not by a problem. Is this correct?</p> <p>thanks in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Responsible-Kiwi-629"> /u/Responsible-Kiwi-629 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1gfna5m/arducam_mega_framerate/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1gfna5m/arducam_mega_framerate/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone!</p> <p>I am new to the PiVPN scene and have watched several YouTube videos now on how to configure a raspberry to run PiVPN.</p> <p>My main purpose was to connect to my network so I could send WoL packet to my main PC so the I could use RDP programs such as AnyDesk or TeamViewer. (I know, it has a paid feature to do WoL but that feature ainâ€™t worth the dollars)</p> <p>My issue is, when the Raspberry Pi is connected to my router via Ethernet and then just running without any devices directly connected to PiVPN, other wireless devices on my network are dropping connections. For instance, I was watching Netflix shortly after successfully installing PiVPN and it was buffering which was odd considering, 1.) I have 3Gbps D&amp;U speeds and 2.) Never experience any issues prior to installing the PiVPN. I unplugged the Pi and the issue was resolved. Also would like to mention, the TV <strong>was not connected</strong> to the VPN, just to clarify
