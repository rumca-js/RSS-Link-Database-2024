Commonly called a Data Lakehouse, this new platform disaggregates compute from storage and can scale out as capacity requirements change. \n\nThis session will introduce the Data Lakehouse and show how it supports the specialized tooling needed for traditional AI, generative AI, distributed training, and MLOps. This talk concludes with some observations on Nvidia\u2019s GPUs and provides recommendations for adopting GPUs.", "id": 1417219, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmYeqQnrqsA", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 499, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCfX55Sx5hEFjoC3cNs6mCUQ", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/gmYeqQnrqsA/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "LF Live Webinar: Building a Data Infrastructure for AI/ML", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-10-30T13:00:07+00:00", "description": "What is so unique about KubeCon + CloudNativeCon?
