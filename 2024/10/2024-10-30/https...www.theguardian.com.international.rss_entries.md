It can be a creative and fun job: “One moment, you’re scrambling to fix a broken JCB that’s in the middle of shot; the next, you’re racing to track down someone cutting a tree in their garden, desperately pleading with them to stop so you can continue shooting the intimate scene.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/oct/30/life-as-a-runner-in-the-uk-film-and-tv-industry">Continue reading...</

Between them Sam Whitelock and Brodie Retallick played 262 Test matches for New Zealand, breaking the record for the most-capped second row pairing in international rugby.

<p>Eye-opening archive footage and a Bowie appearance are the highlights in an otherwise polite but bland documentary</p><p>This slick unrevealing music documentary about alt rockers <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/nov/12/placebo-its-not-the-end-of-the-world-its-just-the-end-of-the-human-species">Placebo</a> highlights the potential drawbacks of making a film about a band decades after their first flush. Back in the late 90s, even if you weren’t blown away by the music, you had to admire Placebo’s bravura and the feral energy of frontman Brian Molko. Today he sits in a studio with the expression of a cat that got the cream, insisting that he is not fussed about fame or celebrity – a statement slightly undermined by the fact he’s wearing sunglasses indoors.</p><p>The point is that it can be easy to mock middle-aged rockers as self-indulgent or smug – and Molko sometimes makes it very easy (“I seek total freedom from the bourgeois constructs that exist in society”).

<p>Colin Farrell’s show-stopping turn, and a scene-stealing Cristin Milioti, make this DC crime series an unlikely winner</p><p>HBO’s DC show The Penguin is one of those rare treats that comes along almost completely unexpectedly, like Batman cracking a smile, or Harley Quinn making sensible life choices. Nobody really expected a show about the second banana in the dark knight’s famed rogue’s gallery to be up to much even if Colin Farrell’s performance, under all those prosthetics, in The Batman was a startlingly grimy diversion from the gloomy glamour of Matt Reeves’s elegant vision of Gotham City’s proto dark knight. But an entire series based on Oswald Cobb’s bloody rise through the ranks of Gotham City’s lurid underworld always seemed a little superfluous to the main event, a spiky little sideshow to keep us entertained, deep down in the gutter with a villainous Humpty Dumpty, while DC works out what to do with the highfalutin’ sequel.</p><p>Past the season’s midway point, and it

<p>A quick but hearty pork dish with all the comfort of a long-cooked stew and a Chinese variation on <em>aglio e olio</em></p><p>It’s good to keep things simple, and I am on a mission to demonstrate just how simple Chinese cooking can be, particularly the kind of food that Chinese families eat at home. We don’t, typically, gather around the kitchen table to pleat dumplings together – Crazy Rich Asians is no more a representation of how we cook than Notting Hill is of Notting Hill! The secret to much of our cooking is in the prep. Thereafter, most dishes come together very quickly and are surprisingly easy – at least the ones I cook are – so I invite you to surprise yourselves with these warming, comforting dishes.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/oct/30/chinese-home-favourites-braised-pumpkin-with-pork-and-spring-onion-and-ginger-noodles-recipe-amy-poon">Continue reading...</a>
