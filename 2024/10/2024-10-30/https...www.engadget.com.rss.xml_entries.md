<p>Last month at Meta Connect, Mark Zuckerberg said that Meta AI was “on track” to become the most-used generative AI assistant in the world. The company has now passed a significant milestone toward that goal, with Meta AI passing the 500 million user mark, Zuckerberg revealed during the company’s latest earnings call.</p>
<p>The half billion user mark comes just barely a year after the social network first launched its AI assistant last fall. Zuckerberg said the company still expects to become the “most-used” assistant by the end of 2024, though he&#39;s never specified how the company is measuring that metric.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Meta’s assistant isn’t the only AI tool that’s boosting the company’s business. Zuckerberg said that AI improvements in its feed and video recommendations have led to an 8 percent increase in time spent on Facebook and a 5 percent increase for Instagram this year. Advertisers are also taking advantage of the company’s AI too

<p>It’s not really billed as a Web3-based game in the trailer, probably because NFTs are as popular of an investment as Blackberry phones or fax machines. However, it still plays a major part in <em>Champions Tactics</em>. The game starts you with a handful of free temporary figurines to start you off but you’ll need to buy your own NFTs to compete using in-game currency or cryptocurrency that can reach into the thousands. The highest figurine called the &quot;Swift Zealot&quot; will set you back $63,000.&nbsp;</p>

It also has a “specialized grasping policy” to help it maintain a firm hold on objects, continuously estimating the state of what it’s holding.

<p>The Nothing Phone (2a) Plus Community Edition is Nothing’s latest smartphone, using designs submitted by the community — and it glows in the dark. Depending on your location, you can register for a chance to buy the device starting today, but that doesn’t guarantee a purchase. Only 1,000 of them will be available, and they won’t be sold in North America, Taiwan and Korea.</p>
<p>Nothing first called for the community to design a product back in March. The contest had four stages: creating a new look, crafting wallpapers, designing a new package and then developing a marketing campaign. People would then submit their ideas and the winners chosen later. These entries later went into the final design as seen now. Those who participated in the community event are given priority to register for a Phone (2a) Plus Community Edition, but it will still be sold on a first-come-first-served basis.

<p>Apple isn't sneaking in any major tweaks this time around, aside from bringing over the Space Black color option to the 14-inch MacBook Pro.

<p>While it might not garner the headlines that immigration, abortion or inflation do, AI is quietly one of the more consequential issues this election season. What regulations are put in place and how forcefully those rules are enforced will have wide ranging impacts on consumer privacy, intellectual property, the media industry and national security.</p>

<p>Over the last four years, the Biden administration’s antitrust efforts have been notable by their sheer number, with ongoing cases against Apple, Meta, Google and Amazon — as well as sparring with tech-adjacent players like Ticketmaster. Biden’s team has pushed to prevent giant mergers, increase competition and punish companies (however lightly) for unfair business practices.</p>
<p>So how about <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/election-2024-how-will-the-candidates-regulate-big-tech-133013600.html">your next president</a>? We compare Kamala Harris (who seems less aggressive on antitrust than her predecessor) to Donald Trump, whose stint in the White House was also pretty active in the antitrust space. Trump already has strong opinions on some of the biggest players in the tech space too.</p>
