On the surface, Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO is the long-awaited follow-up to Budokai Tenkaichi 3. There are new modes like Episode Battle and Custom Battle, but otherwise, it's very much akin to the previous games, right?

Well, yes and no. Sparking! ZERO retains its predecessors' solid gameplay and over-the-top spectacle but infuses several new mechanics into the mix. The Skill Count now determines several things like Transformations and Fusions and is required for techniques like Revenge Counters and Super Perception. Then there's the addition of Sparking! Mode, which can turn the tables in a fight.

It's a lot to grasp, even for long-time fans, but it's equally inviting and exciting. Here are 14 things we wish we knew before playing Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO before it launches on October 11th.
