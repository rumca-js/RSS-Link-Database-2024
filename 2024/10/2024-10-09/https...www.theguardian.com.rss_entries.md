<p>This disturbing documentary about the attack on Be’eri kibbutz is full of troubling interviews and phone/CCTV footage. Sadly, it also demonises Gazans as either killers or looters</p><p>Eight-year-old Emily was holed up in the bomb shelter of her friend Hila’s house when Hamas terrorists found the two girls – along with Hila’s mum, Raaya. The doors, like those in many kibbutz shelters throughout southern Israel, had no locks, because death was anticipated from the air, not from killers going home to home. “When they arrived, we just opened up, because if we held the door they would have shot and the bullets would have hit us,” recalls Emily.</p><p>It was noon on 7 October last year at Be’eri kibbutz, ostensibly a paradise of a farming community for 1,200 Israelis located 50 miles from Tel Aviv and three from Gaza. Emily and Hila had spent the previous night having a sleepover, watching The Vampire Diaries. They woke to a reality much more bloodthirsty.</p> <a href="https://www.theg

 This is a film about the blitz of 1940 which tries to restate the accepted imagery, the dramatic stock footage and familiar ideas but also absorb revisionist approaches – themselves increasingly accepted nowadays: it evokes the way that the British wartime authorities reverently invoked the loyalty of empire and Commonwealth but maintained a casually racist attitude to actual people of colour.<br><br>

Here, finally, was my chance to experience a lauded horror classic I was too young for at the time. As protagonist James Sunderland, I was all ready to search this spooky 90s American Anywheresville of a town for signs of my presumed-dead wife. James has received a letter, you see, from said presumed-dead wife, telling him to meet her in Silent Hill – and hope springs eternal.</p><p>Before even reaching the town, James comes across a woman in a graveyard. Success! Wife achieved! But alas, no: this is Angela, also called to Silent Hill to look for a missing person or some form of closure, and to needlessly slam doors in our protagonist’s face to extend the game’s duration.</p>

Namely, the need to change passwords regularly.</p><p>It’s a familiar scenario. You arrive at the office and need to log on to your company laptop quickly, before your morning meeting.

The likes of Final Fantasy, Persona and Shin Megami Tensei don’t restrict themselves to the familiar trappings of good v evil, wizards-and-goblins, swords-and-magic; they absorb all of those things, and plenty else besides, from science fiction and mythology and comic books and psychology and classical art and whatever else interests their creators, and construct these absurdly ambitious worlds and narratives out of them.

Niche, said one; intense, another. But the most common response: daddy issues. Now here comes Duker’s new show, But Daddy I Love Her, to explore why. It was prompted, she claims, by her absent father’s proposal that they attend therapy sessions together. Could there <em>be</em> any better raw material, asks Duker, for a comedy show?</p><p>At the very least it licenses much navel-gazing gaiety as Duker considers how she appears to others – and how she would like to. Is she hot or cool? Might she pole-dance, and does she have “main character en

<p>Gareth Taylor’s team excited to pit themselves against the best for first appearance in Champions League group stages</p><p>The task awaiting Manchester City on Wednesday evening is nothing short of the toughest in women’s football. It is why, when asked if their opponents are the “best team in the world”, neither the head coach, Gareth Taylor, nor captain, Alex Greenwood, had the slightest hint of hesitation in answering “yes”. They are correct. These are the European champions. Barcelona.</p><p>The team that have won the Women’s Champions League twice in a row, the team that contains both of the past two Ballon d’Or winners, and the team that is averaging five goals a game in their domestic league, will visit at a sold-out Joie Stadium and provide the most forensic assessment yet of&nbsp;how far Manchester City have come as a team in the three and a half years since their most recent meeting.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/09/manchester-city-chance-to-

For too long, unscrupulous private landlords have been able to take advantage of tenants with sudden no-fault evictions, unacceptable living conditions and exorbitant rent increases.</p><p>I know because I’ve been there. I can remember vividly when I was told by a previous landlord that he was “willing to let me stay” in the flat I’d called home for five years if I agreed to a 29% rent increase with two months’ notice.

<p>Former Manchester City winger is yet to reach the heights of last season where he led the Saudi league with 13 assists</p><p>It’s been a difficult second season in Saudi Arabia for Riyad Mahrez. After <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jul/19/tottenham-sign-ashley-phillips-blackburn-3m">moving from Manchester City to Al-Ahli in August 2023</a>, the Algerian topped the assist charts in the Pro League with 13, as well as scoring 11 goals, helping his team to finish third, which for a newly promoted team was as good as could have been hoped for.</p><p>When this season kicked off in August, the remit was a title challenge and for the Greens to lift a trophy by the Red Sea. A few weeks in, neither is looking likely. A home defeat in the King’s Cup, the premier domestic tournament, to a team struggling at the bottom of the second tier was a genuine shock. Worse is the league form. Only seven points from the first six games means Al-Ahli are already 11 points off the pace.

<p>Roast squash stuffed with lentils and herby veg, and butter beans baked in a north-African-style flavour bomb of fresh herbs, garlic, olive oil and lemon <strong> </strong></p><p>Autumn is now well and truly here, and we find ourselves surrounded by squashes, root vegetables and dark-leaved greens. And, as the evenings draw in, what’s not to love about such warming, comforting ingredients? Pulses are a particularly good-value way to make any main meal go a long way. Earthy brown lentils are a great favourite tinned or dried, and even the dried ones don’t take <em>that</em> long to cook, especially if you soak them first. Butter beans, meanwhile, have so much texture and body that they are, to me, the king of the beans.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/oct/09/stuffed-squash-herby-butter-beans-rosie-sykes-recipes-tinned-pulses">Continue reading...</a>

<p>There is transformation, clarity and joy in this selection of work spanning more than six decades</p><p>“I want this to be a small book, / a small, slight book, easy to carry, / the sort of book you would tuck in at the last minute / to read on a plane.” I laughed out loud when I read this; only Margaret Atwood would have the deadpannery to place a poem called Small Book on page 520 of such a big one. Paper Boat unfolds across more than six decades, collecting some of her earliest published work – she began as a poet – and sampling all 14 of her collections so far. Two of these are reprinted here complete, Power Politics (1971) and Dearly (2020), both in their ways books about love. The first will never not be near-terrifying and simultaneously strangely freeing in its viscerality, its acid bite. The latter is so moving and expansive about love and loss that out of its wryness, its gravitas and its deep sadness blooms something far beyond the word “moving”.</p><p>But then Atwood’s

<p>A trip that pairs partially sighted people with fully sighted guides offers reassurance while expanding the possibilities of travel, as our writer discovered in Austria and Germany</p><p>Swimming through the cool clear lake, I’m aware of the densely forested mountains behind us, with pale rocky peaks to our right. A cable car snakes up the side of one, and the sky is turning grey, hinting at an Alpine storm. A standup paddleboarder with blond hair who is wearing bright Hawaiian shorts glides past, and the distant shore that we’re heading towards is clustered with cheery red parasols.</p><p>I can’t really see much of this. I can see the silhouette of the mountains cradling us, the figure of the paddleboarder but not his twist of blond hair, and the cable car would otherwise be a mystery to me. But as I swim alongside a fellow traveller, Sophia, she describes the scene around us in such detail that it fills in the blanks and paints a rich picture for me as a visually impaired person.
