								<p>Hallelujah! Wizards of the Coast has switched back to a print-to-demand model for Secret Lairs. Ah, balls! It’s just a one-off, something the <strong>Magic: The Gathering</strong> creator is doing for its charity drop, but then scrapping for the regular versions of its premium card batches.</p>

								<p>A great new change is coming for the next edition of the <strong>Dungeons and Dragons</strong> Monster Manual in 2025. Treasure is now split into categories, and each monster will have its own favorite types of shiny swag. This will be a great help for making encounters feel more naturalistic, as the Manual will assign each monster the kinds of items they are most likely to collect.</p>

								<p>In 2019, Games Workshop’s fiction publishing arm Black Library began to publish new <strong>Warhammer 40,000</strong> novels in genres it had never before explored. Warhammer Crime and Warhammer Horror titles joined the massive catalogue of war stories and pulp adventures set in the Warhammer 40k and Age of Sigmar universes. But there’s one genre the firm has avoided to this day, leaving mountains of cash on the table: the time is right for <strong>Warhammer Romance</strong>.</p>
