<p>A new website/newsletter from Om Malik and Fred Vogelstein:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Both of us together have followed Silicon Valley’s innovation
engine for more than 50 years. We’ve seen a lot. But one
observation stands out: The best ideas — the ones that launch
meaningful companies — need to seem crazy and stupid at first.</p>

<p>Amazon, Google and Facebook are among the most powerful companies
in the world today, but each of them seemed absolutely
preposterous when launched. When Jeff Bezos started Amazon as an
online bookstore 30 years ago, most didn’t even know what the
internet was. Larry Page and Sergey Brin founded Google in 1998
when most believed search was going nowhere. In the 2000s, Mark
Zuckerberg bet Facebook could fundamentally change the way
billions of people used the internet — to share <em>everything</em> back
when most were terrified about sharing <em>anything</em>.</p>

<p>It’s this messianic belief in a vision that makes many
entrepreneurs so quirky — and s

## Moom 4 Is Excellent, But Not Available in the Mac App Store

<p>Many Tricks:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Moom 4 is only available directly from Many Tricks; it is not
available on the Mac App Store. If it were our choice, it would
also be in the Mac App Store, but it’s not our choice.</p>

<p>Why isn’t it in the Mac App Store? Because the Mac App Store does
not allow apps that aren’t sandboxed. And Moom 4 cannot be
sandboxed, as its use of <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/accessibility/accessibility-api">the Accessibility API</a> makes that
impossible. So how was Moom 3, which also uses the Accessibility
API, on the Mac App Store? Simple: Moom 3 was in the store before
Apple required all Mac App Store apps to be sandboxed, so it was
allowed to remain in the store, as long as we never added new
features.</p>

<p>If Apple ever changes the rules, we will submit Moom 4 for Mac App
Store review, but until/unless those rules change, you can only
get Moom 4 directly from us.</p>

## Microsoft’s Final Surface Duo Software Update

<p>Zac Bowden, writing for Windows Central:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Surface Duo 2 has just received its likely final security
update, marking an end to Microsoft’s brief return to the
smartphone market. The company originally launched Surface Duo 2
in October 2021, and promised to support the product with software
updates for three years. Microsoft was only able to deliver one
major Android version update in that time, a pitiful number for a
$1,500 device.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It wasn’t that Microsoft was only <em>able</em> to deliver one major Android version update in 3 years. They’re Microsoft, for chrissakes. It’s that they could only be <em>bothered</em> to deliver one major upgrade. Commitment is vastly underestimated in the hardware game.</p>

## Home Depot Is Slowly Rolling Out Apple Pay Support

<p>Chance Miller, writing for 9to5Mac:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>According to multiple 9to5Mac readers and reports across social
media, Home Depot has also recently started rolling out Apple Pay
support. Home Depot has been a major Apple Pay holdout, resisting
pressure from its customers to add support for Apple’s tap-to-pay
platform. Notably, Lowe’s — Home Depot’s biggest competitor — <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/12/26/long-time-holdout-lowes-finally-begins-rolling-out-apple-pay-support/">began rolling out Apple Pay support</a> last December. It
certainly seems possible that this move by Lowe’s put pressure on
Home Depot to change its strategy.</p>

<p>Home Depot hasn’t commented on this change in policy, and the
details of the rollout aren’t explicitly clear. It appears to be a
very gradual rollout that started at a small number of locations
over the summer and has recently picked up momentum. Your mileage
may vary for the time being, though.</p>

## Apple Hosted a ‘Cozy’ Mini WWDC for VisionOS

<blockquote>
  <p>Cozy mysteries are a genre of crime fiction where the stories take
place in small, socially intimate communities, and any violence is
limited or happens offscreen. Yesterday, I experienced a “Cozy
WWDC,” and it was wonderful!</p>

<p>The event took place in an intimate setting with about 170
developers. There were no highly produced skits, no jabs at the
competition, no speculative non-existent products designed to make
the media and influencers lose their shit, and no media. The
event, titled “Envision the Future: Build Great Apps for
visionOS,” was held at the Apple Developer Center in Cupertino on
October 2nd.</p>

<p>It focused solely on visionOS and spanned just one day.</p>

<p>The presenters were live. Many wrote code and showed the results
live. Sometimes demos didn’t work the first time.</p>

<p>I have heard from a few other attendees that this was an excellent and very productive little event.</p>
