<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/">Destiny 2</a> developer Bungie has teamed with Discord for one of the chat app's video game "quest" advertisements, offering players a free shader if they log in to its newly released content season, Revenant.</p><p>The blue-ish shader is called Celestial Ties, released during the Season of the Lost in 2022, and earning it is pretty easy if you're a Discord user, requiring you only to play Destiny 2 for a total of 15 minutes. Once that's done, you can redeem the quest in Discord for a redemption code to use on Bungie's website to receive the shader. It's altogether pretty easy--I completed the quest and got my shader before I was finished writing this article.</p><p>Here's what Celestial Ties looks like applied in action.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-destiny-2-discord-quest-gets-you-a-free-shader/1100-6527069/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Halloween is just under four weeks away, so there's still time to make costumes based on your favorite characters from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-2-remake-guides-hub/1100-6526875/">Silent Hill 2</a>. The critically acclaimed remake launched earlier this week, and now Konami has released a Silent Hill 2 costume guide which should help cosplayers put together an outfit in time for Halloween.</p><p>Konami's Silent Hill 2 costume guide <a href="https://img.konami.com/games/silenthill/2r/s/img/SH2_costume_design.pdf">is online as a PDF</a> via the company's official site. Unfortunately, it's not a comprehensive look at all of the costumes in the game. Instead, it features two of the main characters, as well as two of the most popular creatures in the game. Of the four, it will probably be easier to make a James Sunderland cosplay. His outfit is pretty simple to put together, although finding a good match for his jacket might be hard for some.</p><p>Similarly,

<p>Joker: Folie à Deux is not a commentary on fan entitlement or toxic fandom, writer-director Todd Phillips has said. In a new interview, Phillips said that, instead, the sequel is about what happens to a person who has a title thrust upon them that they never truly wanted. In this case, Phillips is referring to how Joaquin Phoenix's Arthur Fleck takes on the title of Joker because it gives him meaning and significance in his otherwise sad life. <strong>This story contains spoilers for Joker: Folie </strong><strong>à Deux.</strong></p><div data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Ay2QU3ZXI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/E3Ay2QU3ZXI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/joker-2-was-never-about-addressing-toxic-fandom-says-director-todd-phillips">Talking to IGN
