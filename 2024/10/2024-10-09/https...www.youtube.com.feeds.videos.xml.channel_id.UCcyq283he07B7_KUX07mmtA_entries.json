marble inlay, which involves carving out marble slabs and inserting precious and semiprecious stones to create elaborate floral and geometric patterns. One of the most famous and prominent examples of marble inlay is the Taj Mahal in India. The descendants of the 17th-century artisans who worked on the Taj Mahal still make a living today using the skills passed down from their ancestors.
