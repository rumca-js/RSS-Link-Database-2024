<p>"Good Games Group’s mission is to bring exceptional indie games to the global gaming community," CEO Alan Patmore said. "Partnering with Ziff Davis allows us to continue working with the amazing indie developers we collaborated with at Humble Games, while also allowing us to chart a new course for the future."

<p>Amazon just <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/amazon-pharmacy-expands-same-day-prescription-delivery-united-states">announced a coming expansion</a> of its same-day prescription delivery service, with 20 more cities and affiliated metro areas entering the program next year. This expansion will open up the feature to nearly half of US residents.</p>
<p>The company said it’s currently embedding pharmacies in many of its same-day delivery facilities to allow for the advanced rollout. The service already exists in cities like Miami, Phoenix and Seattle, but next year it’ll be coming to Boston, Dallas, Minneapolis, Philadelphia and around a dozen more national hotspots.</p>

<p>Zoom’s Zoomtopia 2024 feature drop is, perhaps unsurprisingly, focused on actively integrating AI even more into its platform, especially for Zoom Workplace and Zoom Business Services. There’s plenty to talk about, but we’ll focus on Zoom AI Companion 2.0 for Zoom Workplace since this appears to be the biggest news the company is announcing today.</p>
<p>AI Companion 2.0 promises to be a persistent presence in a Zoom Workplace window, and it will even remember previous conversations and come up with citations for statements users made. Since it’s connected to the web, it can work with external apps like Gmail, Google Calendar and Microsoft Office. Other functions include summarizing documents, email chains and generating content drafts.</p>

<p>Back in the old days, there was no sure-fire indicator of box office poison more than a video game adaptation. The two mediums just didn’t gel. That has changed in recent years and now all kinds of gaming mascots are getting their chance to appear in a major motion picture or, at the very least, <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/twisted-metal-trailer-basks-in-post-apocalyptic-extravagance-211534351.html"><ins>a streaming series</ins></a>.

<p>As we hit day two of Amazon’s fall <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-prime-day/">Prime Day</a> just two Kindle ereaders remain on sale. The standard Kindle, the Paperwhite Signature and both Kindle Kids models are currently out of stock (not to mention the Oasis which has been absent from the site for many months now).

<p>The sixth and final episode of <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/slow-horses-apple-tv-plus-160047710.html"><em>Slow Horses’</em></a> fourth season lands on Apple TV+ today, giving me a flimsy excuse to urge you all to watch. It’s a pulpy, fun and <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/slow-horses-season-2-dead-lions-review-080042215.html">gripping British spy thriller</a> that has finally started to garner some deserved attention. At six episodes a run, it’s respectful of your time in a way plenty of other streaming series aren’t. And while it’s unafraid of showing you the brutal side of espionage, you can revel in its gloriously deathly sense of humor.</p>
<p><em>Slow Horses</em> focuses on Slough House, a department inside Britain’s security service where agents are dumped. MI5 officers who can’t be trusted with real work, or angered their superiors, are dumped in the administrative purgatory. Since you can’t hand a spy a pink slip and

<p>Elon Musk’s Boring Company pitched that its Vegas Loop, underground tunnels built below Las Vegas, would reduce gridlock in some of the busiest parts of the city, offering a new transport solution that isn’t a monorail. People are transported by ordinary Tesla vehicles in tunnels and terminals that are often difficult to get to. (At least, that was my experience earlier this year.)</p>
<p>It <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/the-boring-companys-vegas-loop-is-a-comedy-of-trespassing-errors-191025432.html">hasn’t been the transport game changer</a> the company promised, though. A report from <em>Fortune </em>elaborated on what’s actually happening in those tunnels, saying there have been at least 67 trespassing reports since 2022 and 22 instances of other vehicles following Teslas into the tunnels and stations.</p>
<p>Boring’s monthly reports to the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority also showed several instances of “property damage, t

<p>The Federal Communications Commission has given Starlink and T-Mobile permission to enable their satellite texting service for Florida residents ahead of Hurricane Milton&#39;s landfall. In an <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://x.com/SpaceX/status/1843797123420303789">announcement on X</a>, SpaceX said that Starlink&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/spacex-will-ramp-up-its-launches-in-2024-for-starlinks-satellite-to-cell-service-133050178.html">Direct to Cell satellites</a> will provide emergency alerts for all phones and carriers, not just T-Mobile&#39;s, for those in affected areas. The companies have also enabled basic texting for T-Mobile subscribers, so that they can send and receive texts, as well as text 911 for emergencies, even if they get cut off from the carrier&#39;s network in the midst of the storm.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SpaceX said the companies have activated Direct to Cell for Florida while it&#39;s also in the middle of delivering over

<p>The laptop buzzword of 2024 is "AI PC" — notebooks that have neural processing units (NPUs) for AI-related tasks. But while it's smart to be aware of those systems, there are far more important things to consider beyond AI-savviness. It turns out buying a computer in 2024 isn't really that much different than in recent years: You'll still want to find something that balances power, weight and screen size with your computing needs.<br><br>Out of the 11 notebooks we've tested and reviewed in the first half of 2024, we consider Apple's 13-inch MacBook Air M3 to be the best laptop for most people. It's powerful enough to handle most tasks (even light video editing); it has a great screen and built-in speakers; and its battery could last around 20 hours (depending on what you're doing, of course). The MacBook Air M3 is also one of the lightest and thinnest systems we've reviewed, and it's dead silent, thanks to a fanless design. While Apple has debuted <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="

Flying those sophisticated drones is a whole <em>thing</em> that requires planning. But the Neo can be launched spontaneously to grab quick and fun shots, thanks to features like palm takeoff and voice control. That ease of use also makes it ideal for the social media influencers.</p>
