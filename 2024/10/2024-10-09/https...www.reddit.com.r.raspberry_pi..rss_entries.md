<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’ve been playing with a copy of <strong><em>lxde-pi-rc.xml</em></strong> in my home/config - and nothing seems to change on reboot.

Or am I missing something? I even tried just changing a working shortcut - the one to open the terminal - to launch eMacs instead.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Consistent-Age5554"> /u/Consistent-Age5554 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1g02ifx/cant_redefine_keyboard_shortcuts_on_raspbian_12/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1g02ifx/cant_redefine_keyboard_shortcuts_on_raspbian_12/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello,</p> <p>I had a new PI3B laying around which i wanted to put to use by connecting it to a CRT and playing some SD content from a thumbdrive, however after all my attempts at troubleshooting i can&#39;t seem to get rid of the horrible screen tearing all over the OS.</p> <p>It&#39;s most noticable in full screen video through VLC, and the bigger the resolution of the desktop the worse it gets, but even with the resolution basically as low as it can go and all my video files not exceeding 480p the Screen tearing is still making the videos unwatchable. </p> <p>I am running the PI&#39;s native HDMI output and just converting that outside of the PI instead of using the on board composite out.</p> <p>At this point i feel like i&#39;ve tried everything, however i am new to Pi&#39;s, so i&#39;m probably overlooking something simple, any help would be greatly appreciated.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/us
