After a long time in development, the VR treadmill dubbed the Virtuix Omni One has finally made its way to market. But with the future of VR being as uncertain as it is, can a product like this survive without being backed from the likes of Meta (makers of the Quest 3 and Quest 3S) or Apple (makers of The Vision Pro)? While it comes with a Pico 4E headset, at $2600 bucks, the jury is still out on whether the Virtuix Omni One is the future of immersion.
