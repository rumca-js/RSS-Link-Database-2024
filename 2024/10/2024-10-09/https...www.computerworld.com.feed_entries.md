<p>Multiple research firms reported that the unemployment rate for IT workers dropped precipitously last month — in one instance, by nearly 37% — a decline that marked a serious shift from months of incremental increases mixed with plateaus in unemployment.</p>



<p>Tech industry watchers say the dramatic uptick in hiring is the result of several factors, including a strengthening economy, AI-related talent needs, and increased hiring by small-to-midsized companies.</p>



<p>Smaller organizations have also been scooping up talent left in the wake of <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/1617283/tech-layoffs-in-2023-a-timeline.html">more than two-years’ worth of layoffs</a> by mega corpor

<p>In a significant escalation of its antitrust battle with Google, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) has proposed splitting off Google’s Chrome browser and Android operating system as part of sweeping remedies aimed at curbing the tech giant’s “illegal monopoly” in online search and advertising.</p>



<p>“The DOJ is considering behavioral and structural remedies that would prevent Google from using products such as Chrome, Play, and Android to advantage Google search and Google search-related products and features — including emerging search access points and features, such as artificial intelligence — over rivals or new entrants,” <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dc

<p>Microsoft’s Copilot AI chatbot <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3543512/microsoft-copilot-gets-voice-and-vision-features.html" target="_blank">underwent a transformation</a> last week, morphing into a simplified pastel-toned experience that encourages you…to just chat.</p>



<p>“Hey Chris, how’s the human world today?” </p>



<p>That’s what I heard after I fired up the Copilot app on Windows 11 and clicked the microphone button, complete with a calming wavey background. Yes, this is the type of banter you get with the new Copilot.</p>

<p>A federal jury has found IT consulting firm Cognizant guilty of discriminating against American IT workers. </p>



<p>The court case, Palmer v. Cognizant Tech. Solutions Corp., was argued in Los Angeles at the US District Court for the Central District of California.</p>



<p>The jury also determined that Cognizant should pay punitive damages to compensate the former employees found by the jury to have been victims of discrimination.</p>



<p>The amount of those damages will be determined by the court at a later date. “Counsel are ordered to meet and confer and within two weeks file a Joint Status Report regarding how to proceed on the Court Trial phase of the case,” where the judge will dete
