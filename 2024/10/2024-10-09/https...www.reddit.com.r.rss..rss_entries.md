<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have subscription sources for rss now, whether it&#39;s telegram&#39;s rss channel or a separate rss source, but a lot of apps are just able to look at the original articles, and I&#39;d like to be able to translate each article.</p> <p>I can only click individually now, open the page and use google translate.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Low-Statistician6288"> /u/Low-Statistician6288 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1fzfylc/is_there_an_rss_app_that_provides_translation/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1fzfylc/is_there_an_rss_app_that_provides_translation/">[comments]</a></span>
