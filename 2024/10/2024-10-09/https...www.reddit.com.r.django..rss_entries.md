<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi,</p> <p>I&#39;m trying to implement payments for a website I&#39;ve been voluntold to build through family. A lot of stuff is in place, and I&#39;m just struggling with the paypal stuff atm. It seems paypal has deprecated its old methods, and now has new ways of doing stuff. All the doc examples are using some node.js backend which I really don&#39;t want to add to the project as that seems like a bonkers amount of overhead for just accepting payment for a stay at a shared holiday house.</p> <p>Does anyone know how to implement the new stuff? There&#39;s a REST API and some python SDK, but the docs are extremely unclear to me. I&#39;m not a particularly good programmer and just bumbling my way through this.</p> <p>Cheers for any help or examples.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/UristMcAnswers"> /u/UristMcAnswers </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/1fzk0z7/implemen
