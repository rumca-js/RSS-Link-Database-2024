<p>Whoa, doggy! This Dell monitor is just bursting with extra features. You get a 27-inch panel, a boosted 1440p resolution, and best of all, you get USB-C — one cable for video and 65 watts of power for a laptop — plus a couple of extra USB-A ports.</p>



<p>The one thing you don’t get is a high price because right now <a href="https://www.amazon.com/2021-Latest-Dell-8940-Desktop/dp/B09BXXWT6K/">Amazon is selling it for $179.99</a>, which is $80 off for Prime Day.</p>



<p>With that USB-C video port, extra ports for accessories, and multi-device support via HDMI and a headphone jack, the Dell S2722DC is a great screen if you want an inexpensive home office upgrade. It also makes a pretty good add-on display thanks to the standard VESA mounting point for a monitor arm.</p>



<p>I can’t find any specific mention of the LCD panel type on Amazon’s listing or

<p>This is a compact plug-and-play flash drive that works seamlessly with laptops, gaming consoles, and even your car’s audio system. And it really is super tiny — about the size of a Bluetooth receiver dongle.</p>



<p>But the best thing about this 512GB thumb drive (besides its fantastic sale price) is its speed. It delivers ultra-fast transfer speeds of up to 400MB/s, which i

<p>You may know that biochemist David Baker shares the 2024 Nobel Prize in chemistry with two researchers from Google’s DeepMind. But a video game helped get them there, and you can still play — and contribute to science — even today.</p>



<p>Baker and the University of Washington’s Institute for Protein Design led the team to create <a href="https://fold.it/">fold.it</a>, an online puzzle game in which players actually design synthetic proteins. Originally, the game was coded to allow players to help determine the structure of existing proteins, beginning in 2008. In 2019, the project <a href="https://newsroom.uw.edu/news-releases/video-gamers-design-brand-new-proteins">expanded</a> to allow gamers to actually design new proteins that had never before existed. </p>

<p>Microsoft just released the final security update to its Surface Duo 2 dual-screen smartphone, which comes right before support for the device officially ends October 21, <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/phones/the-surface-duo-is-dead-microsoft-pulls-plug-on-usd1-500-surface-duo-2-after-just-one-android-os-upgrade">reports Windows Central</a>.</p>



<p>The original Surface Duo was launched in September 2020 as an ambitious attempt by Microsoft to unite smartphone and tablet into one with an innovative foldable design. With its dual-screen technology and custom Android operating system, the Surface Duo was marketed as the ultimate productivity-on-the-go device.</p>



<p>Its successor, the Surface Duo 2, was released in October 2021 to negative reception due to bugs, performance issues, limited software support, and a high price tag. (<a href="https

<p>According to statements from the Department of Justice, Google may be forced into breaking up and selling off its business assets.</p>

<p>After some major blunders over the years, Microsoft has clearly been focusing more and more on security.

<p>SK Hynix promotes its teeny-tiny portable SSD with a golden sheen as a “Beetle.” But surely I can’t be the only one who thinks it looks like the scarabs from the 1999 <em>Mummy</em> film?</p>



<p>Ah, I digress. What’s important here is that the SK Hynix Beetle X31 fits in your pocket <em>and</em> in your budget — right now <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SK-hynix-Windowsbased-Androidbased-Smartphones/dp/B0C4KNB2YK/">the 1TB version of this portable SSD is on sale for just $64.99 on Amazon</a>, which prices it as significantly cheaper than even the 512GB version. (And it won’t burrow under your skin and into your brain. I’m almost sure of it.)</p>



<p>All joking aside, the Beetle X31 drive is a nice little gadget that comes with a protective silicone case and a USB-C cable in the box. It’s also way faster than your typical flash drive, with read <em>and

<p>Each GPU has a maximum temperature set by the manufacturer that is considered safe. As long as the graphics chip operates within these specifications, everything is fine. </p>



<p>As soon as temperatures rise, cooling measures begin to take effect. Users often worry about so-called thermal throttling. </p>



<p>This is often misunderstood to mean that the graphics card throttles performance if it does not reach the maximum boost clock rate (boost clock). In fact, the base clock is the guaranteed minimum performance that the GPU achieves under load as long as it is within the safe temperature range.</p>

<p>We love our laptops, but it’d be great if they had more ports. In the process of slimming down modern laptops, they’ve also lost a lot of their connectivity — but you can get ’em back with a good docking station.</p>

<p>This particular model uses Thunderbolt 3 technology for fast and reliable connections between your laptop and all your peripherals. And it has <em>plenty</em> of connectivity options: a DisplayPort 1.4 port, an HDMI 2.0 port, a USB-C PD port, a USB-A 3.2 Gen 2 port, a USB-A 2.0 port, and a Gigabit Ethernet port, and a headphone/microphone jack.

That’s an incredible 62 percent discount off its normal $45 price.</p>



<p>This is a USB-A drive with read speeds of up to 400MB/s. (Amazon reviewers are getting sequential write speeds of over 100MB/s.) While it doesn’t have a USB-C connector, I’d say that its teeny-tiny size makes up for it — it sticks out when plugged in for less than half an inch.</p>

<p>I joined Twitter in 2007, just a year after it was launched, and I’ve been using it almost daily since then. And while all social media platforms evolve over time, Twitter is something different altogether — it has grown so toxic that it has driven away many longtime users.</p>



<p>Most of that has happened under the leadership of Elon Musk, who acquired the platform in 2022: Twitter is now called X, half of its workforce was let go, previously banned users were restored in the name of free speech, and being “verified” is now a subscription-based perk rather than anything based on fame or notoriety.</p>
