<p>Arsenal endured a crushing defeat in their Champions League Group C opener against Bayern Munich. Despite taking a first-half lead through Mariona Caldentey, Jonas Eidevall’s team were eventually beaten 5-2. Pernille Harder scored a 13-minute hat-trick for the German champions after the sides traded goals from Bayern’s Sydney Lohmann and Arsenal’s Laia Codina.</p><p>It may seem excessive at this early stage to think this week could be a defining one in Arsenal’s season. Once again, however, there is trouble afoot in north London and there was no doubt going into this fixture how significant it would be before Chelsea’s visit in the WSL on Saturday. The manner of this defeat, however, particularly the way Arsenal conceded the last two goals, will have been galling for Eidevall as pressure continues to mount.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/09/bayern-munich-arsenal-womens-champions-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>‘This iceberg in Antarctica was so vast, I had to dive down and take 147 photos in sub-zero water, then get a computer to join them up. Ten years on, my toes are still damaged’</p><p>As a kid, I was fascinated by the documentaries of Jacques Cousteau. There was nothing else quite like them – they were a weekly TV appointment. My family lived not too far from the sea and, although that coast wasn’t great for diving, my brother and I used to pretend we were exploring beneath the waves, like Cousteau. My parents would tell us not to go in the water straight after lunch, and warn us to stay away from crabs and jellyfish. When I got into my teens, I used to complain that they were only interested in going to the beach to take in the sun. I thought if my dad was a diver, or if we’d grown up in somewhere like French Polynesia, I could have learned so much more.</p><p>But now I realise that would probably have killed the sense of adventure that still drives me to this day.

It was many Muscogee citizens’ first time visiting the sacred site Hickory Ground, which has taken center stage in a decades-long dispute between their tribal nation and another. At the heart of the fight are Muscogee human remains and artifacts, and a multimillion dollar casino built atop the sacred site.</p><p>On 25 September, the 11th US circuit court of appeals in Atlanta heard oral arguments in the case between the Muscogee (Creek) Nation of Oklahoma and the Poarch Creek Indians of Alabama.

<p>The next entry in the series takes on the tricky task of selecting the best players to turn out for the Viola</p><p><strong>By <a href="https://www.gentlemanultra.com/author/giancarlo-rinaldi/">Giancarlo Rinaldi</a> for <a href="https://www.gentlemanultra.com/">The Gentleman Ultra</a></strong></p><p>Imagine the scene at your local gym if these guys rocked up in their trainers to play. All of them at the peak of their powers, what a joy it would be to watch them waltz around you. Even with their goalie outfield, they would still give you a hammering.</p><p>Fiorentina have been blessed with some great individuals despite winning very few trophies. This side is, for me, a mix of nostalgia, adoration and entertainment.

## ‘Like the Guggenheim!’ Inside Zurich’s staggering, revolutionary new hospital for kids

<p>From the chalet-style patient ‘cottages’ to the walls designed for scribbling on, Herzog &amp; de Meuron’s Kinderspital is a stylish, healing, child-friendly miracle – and it cost less than UK equivalents</p><p>‘Hospitals are the ugliest places in the world,” says Jacques Herzog. “They are a product of blind functionalist thinking, while neglecting basic human needs.” The Swiss architect has a point. With their low ceilings, windowless corridors and harsh fluorescent lighting, hospitals can sometimes seem consciously calibrated to make you feel ill, if you didn’t already. Attempts to jolly them up with coloured cladding panels and art commissions do little to distract from the bleak reality of buildings where the human experience – for patients, doctors and visitors alike – is often an afterthought.</p><p>Herzog insists it doesn’t have to be like this. And he has proof. He is standing in the circular entrance courtyard of his practice’s stunning riposte to the last century of grim

<p>Through a modern playwright and a Tudor figure, the bestselling American author creates a dual narrative about the erasure of women’s creativity</p><p>In 2010, the bestselling American novelist Jodi Picoult complained that her work was suffering from sexism. Her 30 novels address weighty subjects from gay rights to gun control, and if they were written by an author such as Jonathan Franzen or Jeffrey Eugenides, she believed they would not be perceived as beach reads.</p><p>Picoult’s gripe has culminated in&nbsp;By&nbsp;Any Other Name, a novel in which&nbsp;Emilia Bassano, first proposed by the&nbsp;historian AL Rowse as the mysterious Dark Lady, is not Shakespeare’s mistress but the author&nbsp;of Shakespeare’s work. Virginia Woolf wrote an essay imagining the dismal fate of Shakespeare’s sister, whose “genius was for fiction and [who] lusted to feed abundantly upon the lives of men and women and the study of their ways”, but imagining that the Bard might have been a woman, as oppo

She talks about the way that women and girls are manipulated, and what she has learned from other survivors</p><p>There have been times, says Lisa Phillips, when she has broken down during her new podcast series. In <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/from-now-on/id1766405014">From Now On</a>, she interviews survivors of abuse, including a member of the US gymnastics team, while weaving in her own story – one she is still coming to terms with. Now in her 40s, Phillips was 21 when she met the financier Jeffrey Epstein and was sexually assaulted by him. It was only after his death in 2019 – by suicide while detained on charges of sex trafficking girls as young as 14 – and meeting other survivors that Phillips started to understand the truth of what had happened to her. With the podcast also filmed for YouTube, she says you can probably “see me going from t
