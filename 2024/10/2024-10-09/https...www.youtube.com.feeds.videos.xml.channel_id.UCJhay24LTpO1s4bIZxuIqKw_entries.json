If we reflect back on STL and its design principles, as best described by Alexander Stepanov in his \u201cFundamentals of Generic Programming\u201d paper, we see that regular types naturally appear as necessary foundational concepts in programming. Why do we need to bother with such taxonomies? Because STL assumes such properties about the types it deals with and imposes such conceptual requirements for its data structures and algorithms to work properly.\n\nSTL vocabulary types such as string_view, span, optional, expected etc., raise new questions regarding values types, whole-part semantics, copies, composite objects, ordering and equality.\n\nDesigning and implementing regular types is crucial in everyday programming, not just library design. Properly constraining types and function prototypes will result in intuitive usage; ", "id": 1293929, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwHD6-6EDYc", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 421, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCJhay24LTpO1s4bIZxuIqKw", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/ZwHD6-6EDYc/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Regular Types: From Stepanov to C++ Concepts - Victor Ciura - ACCU 2024", "vote": 0}]
