NASA has sent a whole host of spacecraft across the solar system and even beyond. They range from crewed ships to orbit and to the moon to robotic explorers. Among them are a range of mission classes from Flagships to Discovery Class programs. Now a new category has been announced: Probe Explorers. This new category will fill the gap between Flagship and smaller missions. Among them are two proposed missions; the Advanced X-ray Imaging Satellite and the Probe Far-Infrared Mission for Astrophysics.

In the last two decades, the rapid advancement in applications such as environmental monitoring, medical diagnostics, and global positioning has intensified the focus on developing novel mid-IR light sources. Fiber-based mid-IR lasers, which operate beyond 2.5 μm, have emerged as particularly promising high-brightness light sources. However, extending laser generation into the mid-IR wavelength range presents significant challenges, primarily due to the extreme absorption in silica fibers, which results from the high phonon energy of glass matrices.

Micelles are spherical molecular structures usually formed by amphiphilic molecules with block structure, which contain both hydrophilic and hydrophobic parts. The hydrophobic tails of these molecules cluster together to form a core, while the hydrophilic heads face outward, creating a protective shell. This structure allows micelles to encapsulate hydrophobic substances within their core and disperse them in a water-based environment.

Permafrost, the thick layer of perennially frozen ground that covers much of the Arctic, slows down the migration of Arctic rivers, according to a new Caltech study. River migration is a common process in which a river's path meanders over time due to erosion of the riverbanks. This rerouting, which can also occur in sudden floods, poses a threat for many communities that live along and depend on rivers. The findings also have implications for how the Arctic region will be impacted by a warming climate as permafrost thaws over time.

Physicists like to measure things, and they like those measurements to be as precise as possible. That means working at unfathomably small scales, where distances are much smaller than even the diameters of subatomic particles. Researchers also want to measure time down to a precision of less than one second per tens of billions of years. The quest for these ultraprecise measurements in physics is part of a growing field called quantum metrology.

Imagine walking into a room where several different grandfather clocks hang on the walls, each ticking at a different pace. Quantum physicists at the University of Colorado Boulder and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) have essentially recreated that room at the scale of atoms and electrons. The team's advancement could pave the way for new kinds of optical atomic clocks, devices that track the passage of time by measuring the natural "ticking" of atoms.
