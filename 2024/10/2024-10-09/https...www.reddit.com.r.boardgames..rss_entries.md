Great games are games that I felt would be keepers and I would always be happy to play. Fine games were games I would be happy to play if asked, but would not suggest them. Games in the Not Great category are games that I would avoid.</p> <p>I prefer games that have simple rules with a lot of depth and tightness, especially in the decision-making process, and this is reflected mostly in my reviews. I also prefer games with more replayability.</p> <p>Before we begin, I would like to make a special mention of the f

I learned a lot in the process. Takes around 600g PLA. I&#39;d like to cut that down a bit, but at 5% infill, I&#39;m not sure I can do too much.</p> <p>I don&#39;t often sleeve cards, so in it&#39;s current form it doesn&#39;t fit sleeves, but I figure I can make a few quick adjustments and that would work fine. Takes about 600 grams PLA to print fully. Can skip the spacers and lids if you want to save some. </p> <p>We played with it this week and it definitely helped with setup and tear-down times. If you haven&#39;t played it before, the game is long (width wise) so it&#39;s nice to have two separate resource pools for the most grabbed resources (including cards).</p> <p><a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6790266">https://www.th

It was something to do with shipping weight/cost and shelf space retail and cost if they made the box heavier/bigger.</p> <p>Then there&#39;s <strong><em>Final Girl</em></strong>, which is more modular than &quot;expansion&quot; but close enough.

She is a hell of a sport and will play almost anything, but she won&#39;t take any effort outside of a game session to learn rules or think about a game, so I need to be the one prepared know the rules, answer questions,etc. I am very OK with the arrangement because it allows me to actually play pretty much whatever game I want.</p> <p>That said, I am often turned off by a game that requires a major decision BEFORE the game is played. I&#39;m not talking simple choices like choosing a faction or things like that because while that affects the game obviously, you can tailor your strategy to it once the rules are taught and the game begins. But some games that require you to essentially take an action to give yourself resources or a board position before the game proper begins. These decisions are meaningful, but they make absolutely no sens

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I feel like in this hobby we&#39;re so caught up in the &quot;cult of the new&quot; as some people put it. We really should spend more time talking about some older stuff that &quot;still holds up.&quot; </p> <p>I heard about Francis Drake through this subreddit, but after years of being in this hobby. I had seen a post talking about &quot;what are games that have NOT been replaced&quot; like older games that don&#39;t have anything recent to &quot;replace&quot; them. I was intrigued by 2 games that people mentioned in that post, Lancaster (2011), and Francis Drake(2013). Both I&#39;ve since tracked down and got. They are both amazing, I&#39;ve enjoyed them both very much. While Lancaster is great, what&#39;s really unique about it, the voting for laws, is only one part of the game, and the rest is like an auction and worker placement combined. Which are things done a lot. So I do highly recommend this game, but could see how it&#39;s not talked about

Then they were asked if they needed rules explanation to a game they&#39;ve never played before: the player vaguely refused it and said they&#39;ll figure most of it along the way. While I think this can be a way to learn a game - and this player was certainly a quick learner - it was not communicated ideally and led to a few hiccups. Now as the game went on, the player kept one of their headphones on. At first, I thought they might have some medical reason for that. They seemed to hear everything said at the table, so I did not bother asking, but it added to the overall vibe. Then the player started strolling around during other people&#39;s turns.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey all, I just have a question about the rules of the game. This is just the base game and standard edition of Azul. Do we add the negative points of the broken tiles (the tiles on the floor) for each round after wall tiling? Or is it calculated at the end of the game just once?</p> <p>Meaning- if I have a broken tile in the first round, do I include the negative points in each consecutive round or just once at the end?</p> <p>Thanks for the help!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Exotic_Astronaut_"> /u/Exotic_Astronaut_ </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1fzlga3/azul_rule_clarification/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1fzlga3/azul_rule_clarification/">[comments]</a></span>

Even playing with two other experienced Euro game players, we -think- we played it right, but had to make up a few house rules.
