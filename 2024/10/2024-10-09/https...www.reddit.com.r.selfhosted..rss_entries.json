I currently am running Casaos to self host a music/comic hosting home server. Over the last several months of my home server journey I have been trying to educate myself on security, as this is something that is very important to me. I currently use cloudflare tunnels to proxy my services outside of my home network. However I am still somewhat confused as to how encryption works in tunnels. In cloudflare it shows that I can choose to connect to my webui using http or https. From what I understand https is more secure, and is recommended. However I have also noticed that cloud flare seems to convert http traffic to https? I am still unsure as I am still somewhat new to this topic. My main question is, is it safe to route http traffic over cloudflare tunnels?
