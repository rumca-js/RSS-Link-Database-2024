<p>When the Samsung T7 Shield launched in 2022, we loved it for its quick 10Gbps speed, tough outer shell, and good looks—enough to award it a <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/626738/samsung-t7-shield-ssd-review-fast-ruggedized-10gbps-usb-storage.html">4.5 out of 5 rating</a> and one of our coveted Editor’s Choice awards. And right now during Amazon’s Prime Big Deal Days sale, you can grab <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BHZQGN26/">the 4TB version for just $250</a>, a hefty 50 percent off the list price. That’s one of the best prices we’ve seen all year.</p>



<p>As a 10Gbps USB-C drive, the T7 Shield offers read speeds of up to 1,050MB/s and write speeds of up to 1,000MB/s, making it an excellent choice for quick transfers of files. But this rugged drive also offers an added benefit of an IP65 rating, which gives it water and dust resistance. I

<p>Chromebook deals are often about compromise. But there are two Chromebooks on sale for Amazon’s Prime Big Deal Days that I don’t think entail any tradeoffs at all: They’re both solid Chromebooks for less than $200.</p>



<p>I found two, both on Amazon: the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lenovo-3i-Chromebook-Everyday-Notebook/dp/B0BSJ46KY9/">Lenovo IdeaPad 3i for $199.99</a>, and the slightly cheaper <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-Chromebook-Processor-Transparent-CX1500CKA-AS84F/dp/B0CRD43GY6/">Asus Chromebook CX1 for $189.99</a>. </p>



<p>If you’ve followed my Chromebook deal coverage over the years, you know my philosophy: I look for a “good” processor, but I zero in on 8GB of RAM and at least a 1080p screen. I find that most processors handle web pages just fine, but the amount of memory your Chromebook has determines how quickly it needs to cy

<p><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2472367/windows-11-2024-update-24h2-how-and-when-youll-get-it.html">This month’s massive Windows 11 2024 Update</a> comes with all kinds of helpful new features and improvements, but the problematic rollout leaves a lot to be desired. Microsoft certainly dropped the ball.</p>



<p>Just last week, we reported on the fact that <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2476013/uh-oh-windows-11-2024-update-is-blue-screening-heres-what-to-do.html">Windows 11 24H2 is causing blue screens</a> and various other issues. But now, another puzzling issue has reared its head: disappearing mouse pointers.</p>

<p>Laptops are getting ever thinner and lighter, and seemingly losing a lot of input and output ports on their crash diets. So if you have a slimmed-down notebook and still want to get comfy with a bunch of extra accessories and hardware, a USB-C dock is a must.</p>



<p>This Kensington USB-C dock comes with tons of ports and support for double 4K monitors, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kensington-SD2480T-Thunderbolt-MacBooks-K38410NA/dp/B09ZNVR6BH/">it’s shockingly cheap at $49.62 for Prime Day on Amazon right now</a>. That’s less than a third of its $180 retail price.</p>



<p>The Kensington SD2480T USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 dock truly has a ton of ports, so I’m just going to list them out sequentially for you:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>2 x DisplayPort 1.4 ports (single 8K@30Hz or dual 4K@60Hz)</li>



<li>1 x USB-C port (10Gbps)</li>

<p>So you thought your new robot vacuum with its self-emptying bin and LiDAR navigation was state of the art? Well, not anymore. </p>



<p>Robot vacuum technology has grown by leaps and bounds over the past year alone. Besides simply emptying their own bins and mapping your rooms with lasers (that’s <em>so </em>2022), the latest robot vacuums can hoist themselves over door thresholds, extend robotic arms to reach dust particles tucked in corners, apply elbow grease to stubborn floor stains, and more. </p>



<p>Read on for seven of the hottest features coming to the latest robot vacuums and mops, starting with… </p>
