<p>This year we are conducting the eighth iteration of the official Python Developers Survey. The goal is to capture the current state of the language and the ecosystem around it. By comparing the results with last year’s, we can identify and share with everyone the hottest trends in the Python community and the key insights into it. <br /><br />We encourage you to contribute to our community’s knowledge by sharing your experience and perspective. Your participation is valued! The survey should only take you about 10-15 minutes to complete. </p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjoQsFAfrlWLbN4xVt1HQnMSVyW4iT2QLu7VmYziUQcHGkQo-3HPpgfVq03w4IqW-NJhqJZKaFrWDxe9b10fLJC__teni7Uun46SYH-Mu5w-A-EuJteA3LK3TRN7g0gNDg37ep0x3WGaYBh9DSypCD9u43NUcTJJj5uk1KTNcNRXu589wSe8A/s1280/Social_Share_1280x720.png" style="margin-left: 1em;
