The game will come with a variety of graphical improvements, including support for 144hz refresh rates, ultrawide monitors, HDR, and more. The Undead Nightmare DLC will be included, but all multiplayer content will be removed. In other news, a Nintendo Switch modder is being sued by Nintendo after failing to shut his business down. According to Nintendo, the two parties came to an agreement where the modder, Ryan Daly of Modded Hardware, would close shop, and no further action would be taken, but apparently that didn't happen. Daly is now fighting back against Nintendo only WITHOUT a lawyer. And finally, LittleBigPlanet 3 is scheduled to be removed from the PlayStation Store soon, after years of being plagued by hackers and hacked servers.

Undisputed reviewed by Andrew McMahon on Xbox Series X, also available on PlayStation 5 and PC.

Developer Steel City Interactive's approach to boxing in Undisputed is on the right track, but there’s a long road ahead of it. Its emphasis on realism, preparing for fights using RPG-like mechanics, and creating an adrenaline-filled experience in the ring are significant building blocks. Still, the fluidity of its gameplay animations and reactiveness of its commentators don’t come close to living up to the high bar that was set by the Fight Night series back in the late 2000s, and its realistic fighting can be a little dull if you’re in the mood for a KO instead of a TKO. That said, it does serve as a decent meal for an otherwise-starved genre, and that’s a lot better than we’ve had in the last decade.
