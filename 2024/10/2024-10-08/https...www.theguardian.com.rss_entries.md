<p><strong>National Portrait Gallery, London</strong> <br>The hard-living artist’s distorted figures – deformed to reveal mortality, sex and death – often left their subjects feeling injured. But this biting show should leave crowds astonished</p><p>Teeth. We all have them, or start out with them. We’re supposed to take care of them, so we can flash a smile. But for Francis Bacon, they are a glimpse of death in a living human face, a white hardness that will persist when all our soft matter is gone. In Study of the Human Head, a man in a dark jacket smiles out with perfect teeth. Then you realise Bacon has superimposed an x-ray image of the human head on to this living man. It is the grin of a skull.</p><p>The National Portrait Gallery has assembled a truly biting show of Bacon’s portraits and meditations on portraiture. Not only is it the best Bacon show I have ever seen, it also answers all questions about his greatness. Was he a genius or a showman, a seer or sensationalist? Critic

<p>This careful, intelligent documentary about the 1984 IRA attack on the Conservative party conference is largely a study of its victim – and her failure to understand the issues that led to it</p><p>Bombing Brighton: The Plot to Kill Thatcher is a documentary with a gap in the middle. Its main interviewee is the Brighton bomber himself, Patrick Magee, who in 1984 placed an incendiary device in the Grand hotel, timed to explode during the Conservative party conference. It did so in the early hours of 12 October, killing five people. How did Magee choose where to place it? Where was it hidden? How did he know it wouldn’t be found?</p><p>Magee simply refuses to answer these questions, even though many of the facts are known: “I&nbsp;won’t talk at all about any of the operational detail.” But Guy King’s film has knottier issues to deal with. It considers how we view violence in asymmetric conflicts and how we can move past it. As for the personalities involved, Magee proves to be fascin

<p>A doctors’ ability to provide sound patient care diminishes with age. We need a comprehensive, fair and respectful way of assessing fitness to practice</p><p>At my medical graduation over 25 years ago, the earnest guest speaker made us promise we would get ourselves a GP. All 160 of us humoured him, secretly believing illness was something that happened to other people.</p><p>I was 23 years old then. It took me 20 years to honour the promise. In that time, no friend issued me a prescription or arranged any tests: I guess I was lucky. During pregnancy, my obstetrician took charge but didn’t mention getting a GP. Becoming a parent made me realise the importance of objectivity in healthcare, which is how my family found a GP. To be clear, I don’t recommend any doctor delay finding a GP like I did, especially in this environment of stress and burnout.<strong> </strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/09/when-is-it-time-for-an-older-doctor-to-hang-up-thei

<p>Stephen Tung plays a former 80s director-stuntman drawn back into the present-day action-film industry as it faces an identity crisis</p><p>This is a film that is more likely to work for hardcore fans of Hong Kong cinema than HK-curious mainstream viewers. Stuntman is an action-drama that folds in on itself with a tale about the contemporary Hong Kong film industry facing an identity crisis in which well-known figures from its own past appear.

It’s not as if the candidates do not draw a sufficient contrast. There can be few people alive these days, let alone few registered voters in America, who do not know much more than they ever thought they would about the habits, history, and inner psyche of Donald Trump, who has now been a singularly domineering force in national politics for nearly a decade. The Harris campaign has been trying to play their candidates’ comparative newness on the national stage as an asset, rigorously keeping her from saying much of substance, but Kamala Harris, too, is by now a well-known figure: once a popular and high profile senator from the country’s biggest state, she moved on to a busy, energetic, and extremely visible vice presidency.</p><p>The candidates are about as familiar to Americans as they’re going to get; an

This leaves Isaac marooned with stepmother Laura (Julia Brown) in an isolated showpiece home in the forest where, in their separate corners, both struggle with their grief.

<p>Documentary follows a group of dedicated celebrity impersonators who band together to turn their passion into a decent living</p><p>British film-maker Tom Goudsmit has chosen a quintessentially American subject for his first feature-length documentary: people seeking to better their lots by impersonating, or just pretending to be, celebrities. In this case, all three of the subjects are young black men from the hinterland of central California who impersonate the late Michael Jackson from different eras in the pop star’s life. High-voiced Chavail dresses as MJ from around the time of his early-80s album Bad; Quintin, the most diehard Jackson fan of the three, dresses as his hero in the Thriller era, and Malachi, who really wants to be a singer in his own right, covers Dangerous-era Jackson.</p><p>Working as a team, they travel to San Francisco and later Los Angeles to busk on the streets or wander around nightclubs, hoping to pick up tips. It’s a tough way to earn a meagre income,

<p>Argentina’s president Javier Milei has become the latest dignitary to be rumbled borrowing from a Jed Bartlet speech. It wouldn’t happen here though … would it?</p><p>Last week, Argentina’s president Javier Milei gave an address to a group of world leaders. His speech was stirring, inspirational and soaringly eloquent. “We believe all people should live free from tyranny and oppression, whether in the form of political oppression, economic slavery or religious fanaticism,” he said. “This fundamental idea must not be mere words – it has to be supported by deeds: diplomatically, economically and materially.”</p><p>The speech was well received by all. That is, except for those who had watched The West Wing, because they might have remembered an episode in the fourth season where President Bartlet said the following: “We are for freedom from tyranny, everywhere, whether in the guise of political oppression … or economic slavery … or religious fanaticism … That most fundamental idea can

<p>This perceptive study of the former US president reveals a self-styled ‘Mr Norm’ with few real political beliefs but a sense of decency</p><p>As we’re reminded every four years, the US, while purporting to be a republic, is more like an elective monarchy. Presidents campaign as partisans, but once inaugurated they’re expected to transcend politics; draped in the flag, their task is to exemplify the national character. Although nowadays the country is too fractious to be personified by any individual, in less schismatic times Ronald Reagan managed the feat – as American author Max Boot argues in his generous yet sharply perceptive biography – because he was “a mainstream, generic, nonhyphenated American, Midwestern born”. “Mr Norm is my alias,” Reagan said. “Average will do it.”</p><p>But was Reagan amiably bland or somehow blank?

## The scandal of food waste and how we can stop it

<p>Every informed observer agrees that food waste and loss must be reduced if we are to feed all humans. What’s stopping us?</p><p>In traditional societies, little to no food goes to waste. Every edible part of an animal or plant is utilised. Researchers found that the members of a Maasai cattle herding community in northern Tanzania were outraged at the thought of intentionally wasting food, calling those who would do so “lunatics”. Some even said it was worse than killing a person, because murder leads to one death, whereas wasting food could result in several.</p><p>Attitudes towards waste are very different in industrialised nations. The United Nations Environment Programme (Unep) estimates that 17% of total global food production is wasted and around the same amount lost, meaning that around a third of food produced is not consumed. The global average for household waste is 74kg per person annually, and this figure is broadly similar for lower-, middle- and high-income countries.
