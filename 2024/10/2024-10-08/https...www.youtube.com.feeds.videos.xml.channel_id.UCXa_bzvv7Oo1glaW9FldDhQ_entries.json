Sony has always had a solid lineup with its first-party studios, and most of those games didn\u2019t follow trends or force itself into a crowded genre. \n\nNaughty Dog was faced with the ultimatum to either be a live-service studio or continue making rich narrative single-player experiences when they were developing TLOU Online. Thankfully, they shut the project down and focused on the latter, though most of those seem to be remasters and remakes at the moment but that\u2019s another discussion. \n\nSony should follow in their footsteps.
