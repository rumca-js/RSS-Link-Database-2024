Scientists have revealed a new cellular adaptation to starvation, in which the mitochondria of yeast cells get coated by ribosomes. Surprisingly, the ribosomes attach to the mitochondrial outer membrane with a very unusual 'upside-down' orientation. The discovery of this mechanism has potential implications for our understanding of how stressed cancer cells survive starvation.

As the global push towards low-carbon societies accelerates, a new study reveals that justice concerns are increasingly surfacing in legal disputes over climate policies and projects. This phenomenon, described as 'just transition litigation', emphasizes the need to balance climate action with social justice considerations, ensuring that vulnerable communities are not disproportionately impacted.

## New insights into ammonia decomposition

Until now, it was considered certain that people are more likely to cooperate if the benefits from cooperation are higher. A recently published, large-scale study has now called this finding into question: in over 2000 study participants, the researchers found no relationship between benefits from cooperation and willingness to cooperate.

## A new technique that makes competition between tumor cells visible can help personalize treatments for multiple myeloma

## Holographic 3D printing has the potential to revolutionize multiple industries

Researchers have developed a novel method of 3D printing that uses acoustic holograms. The process is called holographic direct sound printing (HDSP). It builds on a method introduced in 2022 that described how sonochemical reactions in microscopic cavitations regions -- tiny bubbles -- create extremely high temperatures and pressure for trillionths of a second to harden resin into complex patterns. Now, by embedding the technique in acoustic holograms that contain cross-sectional images of a particular design, polymerization occurs much more quickly. It can create objects simultaneously rather than voxel-by-voxel.

## How diabetes-risk genes make cells less resilient to stress

Researchers have now discovered that DNA sequence changes known to increase a person's risk for diabetes are linked to how well pancreatic cells can handle two different kinds of molecular stress. In people with these DNA changes, the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas may be more likely to fail or die when exposed to stress and inflammation.

## The secret strength of our cell guards

Proteins control most of the body's functions, and their malfunction can have severe consequences, such as neurodegenerative diseases or cancer. Therefore, cells have mechanisms in place to control protein quality. In animal and human cells, chaperones of the Hsp70 class are at the heart of this control system, overseeing a wide array of biological processes. Yet, despite their crucial role, the precise molecular mechanism of Hsp70 chaperones has remained elusive for decades. Using a cutting-edge nanopore single-molecule technique, a team has now made a significant breakthrough in determining how Hsp70 chaperones generate the force needed to manipulate the structure of their client proteins.

Muscle activation in people suffering from hip osteoarthritis might be a case of 'mind over matter', new research has shown. A recent study investigated muscle function in people with hip osteoarthritis and found that these patients were unable to activate their muscles as efficiently.

## Increase access to nature in all daily environments and in education

Although access to nature is a basic human right, people's actual use of green spaces is subject to inequalities. A research team analyzed what conditions make it more likely that people are exposed to nature across generations: the availability of green spaces around where they live, work and shop, as well as nature relatedness and past natural experiences. Their findings may inform policies for urban planning and education for the improvement of human health.
