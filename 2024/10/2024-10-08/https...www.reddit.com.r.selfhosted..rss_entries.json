For any of you familiar with What&#39;s Up Docker (WUD: <a href=\"https://fmartinou.github.io/whats-up-docker/#/\">https://fmartinou.github.io/whats-up-docker/#/</a>) I have been trying to configure it to automatically make minor or patch updates to my containers (with a notification that they happened just in case) and then only notify me of major updates (with no automatic updates). The problem is with this trigger:</p> <p><code>WUD_TRIGGER_{{trigger_type}}}_{trigger_name}_THRESHOLD=major</code></p> <p>The threshold setting <code>major</code> is for Major, Minor, OR Patch and not JUST Major updates. So my goal was to have a discord server where I have a text channel for minor update notifications just so I know what happened and then a text channel for ONLY major updates. That way I can look into them and update them myself.
