This article is, at least in part, a rebuttal to my esteemed colleague’s baseless diatribe against Infinity’s N4 edition. Let us leave to one side that the honourable gentleman chose to put the boot into the aged edition as it lies on its final sickbed. Instead, we will defeat his arguments one by one, with [&#8230;]

It’s an easy format to plug just about any setting or I. P. into, and over the years there have been deck building games covering every imaginable theme, from dinosaurs (Apex [&#8230;]
