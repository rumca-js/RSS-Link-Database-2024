Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the DEI grift is collapsing across the country, but some organizations are clinging to it. Also, Kamala Harris sits down for her first real interview where she's actually challenged. It doesn't go well for her. And the White House press secretary gets into a heated exchange with a Fox News reporter. But there's something else about the video that deeply confuses me. And a new documentary about euthanasia features an incredibly disturbing interview with one of the ""doctors"" who administers these ""treatments."" She said a lot more than she meant to.
