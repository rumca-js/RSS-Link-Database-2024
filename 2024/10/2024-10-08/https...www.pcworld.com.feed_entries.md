<p>Amazon’s second Prime Day sales event of the year is finally here, but Amazon isn’t the only one with hot deals. Consider this incredible deal on the <strong>Samsung Galaxy Book3 360</strong> — a lightweight 2-in-1 laptop with an OLED touch-enabled display and powerful hardware — for a <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/samsung-galaxy-book3-360-2-in-1-13-3-fhd-amoled-touch-screen-laptop-intel-13th-gen-evo-core-i7-1360p-16gb-memory-512gb-ssd-graphite/6531056.p?skuId=6531056">stunningly low price of $700 at Best Buy</a>, an enormous savings of $550.</p>

<p>A USB stick is a smart tool for anyone who needs to move large amounts of information between two different computers — or take a lot of files with them when travelling.</p>



<p>It’s simple to use: Just plug the little “memory stick” into your computer’s USB port and you can easily move files back and forth as if it were a hard drive on your computer. There are small USB sticks that cost just a few tens, and if you pay a little more, there are variants that hold several hundred gigabytes.</p>



<p>If you have an old USB stick that you want to clear of information, you can do this in two different ways.</p>



<p>The easiest is to insert it into your computer, open Explorer and click on My Computer. Right-click on your USB stick, select Format and follow the instructions.</p>



<p>Some USB sticks contain various pre-installed programs when you buy them,

<p>When I bought my latest phone, it came with 512GB of storage — and I thought that’d be enough. That’s almost ten times as much internal capacity as my first PC! But it’s still not enough, dammit, and I ran out of space loading it up with questionably-obtained TV shows for a long flight.</p>



<p>If you’ve found yourself in the same kind of situation, there <em>is</em> a solution: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-1-5TB-microSDXC-Memory-Adapter/dp/B0CJMRW771/">this SanDisk microSD card with a whopping 1.5TB capacity</a>. Surely that’ll be enough to last forever. Right?</p>



<p>Normally $150, the SanDisk Ultra UHS-1 MicroSDXC Card is on sale for Amazon Prime Day with a sweet $60 discount. That brings it down to $89.29, which is barely $4 more than the 1TB variant (which is currently going for $85). I could give you sarcastic figures about how many M
