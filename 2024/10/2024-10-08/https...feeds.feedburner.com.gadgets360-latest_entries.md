NASA is set to launch the Europa Clipper mission to explore Jupiter’s moon Europa in search of signs of life. The spacecraft will conduct a detailed investigation of the icy moon, where scientists suspect a liquid ocean exists beneath its frozen surface. Europa Clipper will analyse the moon’s surface, water plumes, and magnetic field to understand its potential habitability. The mission is a significant step towards exploring life beyond Earth. However, discoveries will take time, as the spacecraft will reach Europa after a five-year journey.

NASA's Curiosity rover is providing new insights into how Mars transformed from a potentially habitable planet, abundant in liquid water, to the inhospitable landscape seen today. Researchers discovered that carbon-rich minerals found in Gale Crater indicate extreme evaporation and suggest the planet's climate could support only transient liquid water. The study highlights two potential formation mechanisms for these minerals, offering varying scenarios for Mars' ancient habitability. This research contributes valuable knowledge to our understanding of the Martian environment and its ability to support life.
