<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi guys, my RPi has pretty bad Wi-Fi signal ( FLiRC metal case doesn&#39;t help) and it really gets terrible with Micro HDMI plugged in. It&#39;s a 1.5 Rev, but that issues it&#39;s definitely still there (tested 2 different Pi). I tried the Archer T2U Plus dongle but despite me finding the drivers on github, it wouldn&#39;t find any AP. Has any of you tested a working dongle? I found the theorethically compatible chipsets, but I can&#39;t really find specific tested products online</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Ihadtosubscribe"> /u/Ihadtosubscribe </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1fzc9bi/tested_wifi_dongles_for_rpi_4b/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1fzc9bi/tested_wifi_dongles_for_rpi_4b/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Recently I was having issues with access to the USB SSD drive I had been running on my RPI4 with the current version of MoOde Player. I tried several different attempts at fixing it, including a few suggestions from the forum, and it started working; though I am not sure why. It was formatted to NTFS, I reformatted it to Ext4 and reloaded all my music (~11k songs). When everything was working, I could write, delete, and make changes to the drive remotely using WinSCP. </p> <p>Now I have a new issue that may be somehow related. When I play my music, it sounds as though it is constantly being interrupted. It&#39;s hard to describe in writing, but it would play the music, and it would sound as though there was a momentary interrupt (or skip in old LP nomenclature) which would happen every couple of seconds. I reformatted a USB stick drive to NTFS, loaded some music and it plays fine. I plug the SSD back in and it still has the same issue. I&#39;ve verifi

Today I&#39;m in total misery after spending almost 1 week struggling with a recurring problem... I&#39;ve scoured quite a few forums on the subject... with no results. I must even confess to having consulted chatGPT: to no avail. </p> <p>I&#39;m appealing to human intelligence, the real thing... to get me out of this mess (I&#39;m a professional mushroom grower: gourmet and medicinal mushrooms). </p> <p>I&#39;ve designed several automated systems with old ATM models (for real-time management of humidity, ventilation, lighting, heating) and so far I haven&#39;t had too many complaints.
