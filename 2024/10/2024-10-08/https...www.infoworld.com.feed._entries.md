<p>Every enterprise today is looking to get as much as possible out of its data and AI investments. But when building in-house apps, developers can struggle with infrastructure constraints and maintenance, security, data governance, compliance, and other issues.</p>



<p>“Companies want to build custom experiences,” Shanku Niyogi, VP of product at Databricks, told InfoWorld. However, “as soon as you start to build a custom application, you start to fall off a cliff.”</p>



<p>Databricks says its new platform, Databricks Apps, can help deal with these complexities. Today available in public preview on AWS and Azure, it says the platform allows users to create secure, tailored, enterprise-specific

<p>Artificial intelligence has the power to revolutionize industries, drive economic growth, and improve our quality of life. But like any powerful, widely available technology, AI also poses significant risks. </p>



<p>California’s now vetoed legislation, <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB1047">SB 1047</a> — the Safe and Secure Innovation for Frontier Artificial Intelligence Models Act — sought to combat “catastrophic” risks from AI by regulating developers of AI models. While lawmakers should be commended for trying to get ahead of the potential dangers posed by AI, SB 1047 fundamentally missed the mark. It tackled hypothetical AI risks of

<p>In a significant development in the cloud computing industry, AWS, a leading hyperscaler, has recently acknowledged <a href="https://www.itpro.com/cloud/cloud-computing/aws-says-enterprises-are-moving-back-on-prem-but-does-cloud-repatriation-really-threaten-hyperscalers">considerable competition from on-premises</a> IT solutions. This admission counters the longstanding belief that enterprises seldom revert to on-premises systems once they transition to the cloud.</p>



<p>AWS’s statement emerged during a Competition and Markets Authority hearing in the United Kingdom, which scrutinized the current state of competition within the cloud market. At the hearing, AWS argued that the prevailing perc

<p>SAP wants developers to view its Build platform as the one extension solution for all of SAP’s applications, according to Michael Aneling, chief product officer for SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP).</p>



<p>At its TechEd event this week it is showing a new extensibility wizard, now available, that gives developers access to SAP Build directly from S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition, enabling them to extend custom fields, business logic, and processes either within the S/4HANA Cloud ABAP environment or in SAP BTP.</p>



<p>“A critical feature of this integration is the knowledge of business context — such as events and objects — when creating business processes and while transitioning between
