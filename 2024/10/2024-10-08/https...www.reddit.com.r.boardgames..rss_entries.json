I&#39;ve been looking at murder mystery sets (Night of Mystery, Freeform Games) and wanted to ask for advice before making a decision (they&#39;re quite expensive!). Anyone know of a good murder mystery for 5 or 6 people? One of the guests is known to be a last minute flake but otherwise I could say 6 for sure. If we get one rated for 6 people (e.g. from Night of Mystery), could we still play it if only 5 showed up? Seems like a lot of them are for minimum 6 people. Also, this is all of our first time playing (and my first time hosting) murder mystery.

My number one piece of advice for getting better at ANY game: Learn to evaluate moves.</p> <p>Most players who struggle at a game struggle to even get what they&#39;re trying to do. Maybe you&#39;re playing Catan and can&#39;t understand what resources you should go for or playing Scythe and don&#39;t know what upgrades to focus on, so you just sorta go randoms directions and flounder.</p> <p>In these cases (which I think are representative of most &#39;bad&#39; players), the player can&#39;t understand what makes a move good or bad. They just do moves without a particular end in mind.</p> <p>If a player managed to have a general idea of &quot;what do my moves need to accomplish and how good is this move at accomplishing th", "id": 1284176, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1fyp5gl/a_simple_way_to_improve_at_all_board_games_learn", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 473, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "A simple way to improve at all board games: Learn how to evaluate moves relative to victory", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-10-08T02:03:37+00:00", "description": "<table> <tr><td> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1fyp0h6/where_is_this_piece_from/\"> <img src=\"https://preview.redd.it/6e5ueksvwftd1.jpeg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=96f6373cb348c860ecf8a6d81e0d80d86c4f5e69\" alt=\"Where is this piece from\" title=\"Where is this piece from\" /> </a> </td><td> <!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Found this piece on the floor it definitely fell out of one of our games.

I want to start up a text only game that we can play over a longish time scale or 5-8+ players.</p> <p>We have played diplomacy before and while I wouldnt mind starting up another game of it, I have been searching for a game that is a better fit / another option with little luck. Im hoping to find something that has a lot of discussion and/or negotiation. I&#39;m open to anything but it seems like some sort of war game like diplomacy or social deduction game like mafia would fit best.</p> <p>Ideally I would like the game to fit as many of these requirements as possible but doesnt necessarily have to hit them all:</p> <ol> <li><p>Simultaneous turns: I want to minimize waiting on others to play.

I can&#39;t see the patterns that the others can see. Sometimes I think hey maybe I&#39;m doing better but then I get thrashed at an 18xx or I don&#39;t use my POK faction as well as I could have and I&#39;m with the bottom half all game.</p> <p>I would like to just be good at something sometimes ya know? Is it just me out here trying to keep up? </p> <p>And everyone shows up saying they don&#39;t know the game beforehand. They just play. Is that true??
