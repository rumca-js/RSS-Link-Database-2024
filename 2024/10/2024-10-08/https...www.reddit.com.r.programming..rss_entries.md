I can log in and authenticate myself but I can’t pull anything from it using getdocs, fetch and collections and REF. I have never done this so I am clueless as to what could be the problem. I asked chat why no matter what I do i get missing or insufficient permission error when I try to fetch and it recommended me to check the rules. The rule version is 2 and allow read, write: if false The application I’m making will start on a log in page(no sign up option) and then after logging in I’m supposed to be able to see my info like a profile. Is security rule actually the problem? Is this like PHP where I have to prep statements and fetch or can I do my const db = getfirestore(app) and use that using getdocs? </p> <p>If I’m missing something, I can share more details. I can also share my code. </p> <

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I AM NOT AFFILIATED, I WOULDNT HAVE POSTED A LINK BUT THIS SUB REQUIRES ME TO</p> <p>I saw a tweet about this app that lets you search for second hand clothing online. An example query you can give is: </p> <p>“wedding theme: off the cuff floral upscale vibes, it&#39;s a summer wedding, guest dresses inspo, I like dior, son de flor, chanel or oscar de la renta, no fast fashion, size 0 or 2, between $450-3500. lightly used, red, floral, blue&quot;” </p> <p>and it will return items very relevant to that search.</p> <p>You can also search using images. </p> <p>It seems they are able to get even very obscure brands all from websites such as Depop, eBay, poshmark, etc.</p> <p>My guess is some sort of vector search? But how are they able to gather so much data (legally? lol) and then do such advanced searches?</p> <p>Thank you</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Additional_Bug_487"> /u/Additional_Bug_487 </
