<p>Juli Clover, MacRumors:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the release notes for the sixth beta of the macOS Sequoia 15.1
update, Apple says that users aren’t going to see as many popups
for apps they regularly use.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Applications using our deprecated content capture technologies
now have enhanced user awareness policies. Users will see fewer
dialogs if they regularly use apps in which they have already
acknowledged and accepted the risks.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Why in the world didn’t Apple take regular use of a screen-recording app into account all along?</p>
