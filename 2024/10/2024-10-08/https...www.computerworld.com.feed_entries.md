<p>Once upon a time, Microsoft Office ruled the business world. By the late ’90s and early 2000s, Microsoft’s office suite had brushed aside rivals such as WordPerfect Office and Lotus SmartSuite, and there was no competition on the horizon.</p>



<p>Then in 2006 Google came along with <a href="https://googlepress.blogspot.com/2006/10/google-announces-google-docs_11.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Google Docs & Spreadsheets</a>, a collaborative online word processing and spreadsheet duo that was combined with other business services to form the Google Apps suite, later rebranded as G Suite and now as <a href="https://workspace.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">

<p>Surprise, surprise — eh? But oh, it be true: While we’ve been off gazing at grass and thinking about gibbons (or whatever it is <em>you</em> do with your downtime), Google’s been quietly sending out an under-the-hood, <em>almost</em> unnoticeable update that unlocks some serious new theft protection muscle.</p>



<p>The rollout revolves around a system-level service called Google Play Services — which means the update gets served by the regular ol’ Google Play Store and c
