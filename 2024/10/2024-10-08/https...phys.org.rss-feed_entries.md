In the rural village of Téssékéré, the increasing number and intensity of droughts linked to climate change is making the lives and livelihoods of the local Fulani communities increasingly vulnerable. Here, in the northern Sahel desert region of Senegal (known as the Ferlo), the pastoral population walks over dry, dusty ground with their livestock in search of grazing areas and working borehole water pumps. In favorable years, these farmers can stay in the fields around their local borehole, but climate change is forcing them to move further afield to find pasture to feed their cattle.

However, not all attempts to establish home gardens are successful or able to yield the full benefits hoped for. Recent research in India's state of Odisha involved community members in identifying which elements of home gardens work and what do not.

As is well known, the normal distribution is a key tool in probability and statistics. It can be described as a distribution that obeys a universal rule derived from one of the most important theorems in probability: the central limit theorem, often called the CLT. More practically, it also describes how some data naturally cluster around a central value, the shape of whose corresponding histograms (representing the distribution of the data) is a well equilibrated bell curve.

Earth's continental configurations have changed dramatically over its billions of years' history, transforming not only their positions across the planet, but also their topography as expansion and contraction of the crust made a mark on the landscape. Some areas of continental crust have maintained long-term stability from the beginning of Earth's history, with little destruction by tectonic events or mantle convection, known as cratons.
