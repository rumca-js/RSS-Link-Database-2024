								<p>The new Dungeon Master’s Guide, due out in mid-November, will change how players craft magic items in <strong>Dungeons and Dragons</strong>.

								<p>Games Workshop has released a new unit for its sci-fi skirmish game Necromunda that directly references a classic, and delightfully silly, <strong>Warhammer 40k</strong> design from the 1980s. The new Ironhead Squat Prospector Exo-kyn wear heavy exo-suits, which protect them from environmental hazards, wild beasts, and rival gangs. It's also a call back to a range of egg-shaped elite space dwarves released for the first edition of Warhammer 40k between 1989 and 1991.</p>
