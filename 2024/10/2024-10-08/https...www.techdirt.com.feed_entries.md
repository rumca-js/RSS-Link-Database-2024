Trumpist Republican outrage (most of it manufactured) over being spied on by the US government almost led to significant reforms to Section 702 surveillance powers, specifically the loophole the FBI abuses to search for Americans&#8217; communications in the NSA&#8217;s foreign-facing haystack. But that all got scuttled during the infighting and increasing desperation to just give [&#8230;]

Though the current popular narrative about social media seems to be that it is harmful and has little or no redeeming value, the truth (which a lot of people know) is that it also has a lot of value, and the potential to be even better. A recent research report from New_Public finds some ideas [&#8230;]

Creating surveillance backdoors for law enforcement is just asking for trouble. They inevitably become targets for hackers and foreign adversaries. Case in point: the US just discovered its wiretapping system has been compromised for who knows how long. This should end the encryption backdoor debate once and for all. The law enforcement world has been [&#8230;]

The EU Commission is the definition of insanity. It has tried for years to convince all EU members the best way to fight crime is to undermine the security and privacy of millions of EU residents. And, for years, it has failed to make an argument capable of convincing a majority of the 27 European [&#8230;]

How quickly do you think we’d be having Congressional hearings about “election interference” if Mark Zuckerberg so much as posted a “Harris/Walz” lawn sign in front of his house? Yet, Elon Musk is now directly tweaking the site he owns to push his favored political candidate, even seizing people’s accounts to promote Trump. One of [&#8230;]

## Republicans, Musk, Pretend To Care About Media Consolidation… When George Soros (Read: A Jew) Is Involved

Though Republicans are the worse of the two offenders, neither Democrats nor Republicans have cared all too much about preventing media consolidation. As a result, U.S. journalism and media has increasingly fallen into the hands of a handful of wealthy corporations and billionaires; and it&#8217;s routinely reflected in terrible journalism (especially political journalism) and bumbling [&#8230;]

It&#8217;s not just the Rankin County (MS) Sheriff&#8217;s Office being scrutinized by the US DOJ. While that&#8217;s the main concern following the conviction of six deputies of a self-proclaimed &#8220;Goon Squad&#8221; who spent hours brutalizing and torturing two black men, the rest of Mississippi apparently isn&#8217;t in great shape either.
