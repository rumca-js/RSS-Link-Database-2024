I got a scart splitter as seen on the picture. I connected my c64, my nes and my Amiga 600 to it, all of it works except the Amiga 600. It only give a picture if i connected directly on to the tv s scart port.. I also tried the comp port with a scart converter an it works in that way but obiously the image quality is way worst in that way.. so i really would like to make it work with the rgb video out.. Anybody here have any experience with such scenario? Or maybe any suggestion? </p> <p><a href="https://pre

It sounds a lot like it goes to an Amiga game, though I never had nor played an Amiga, so I thought I&#39;d ask around these parts to see if anyone can identify the game for me.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/AmTheCause"> /u/AmTheCause </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1fyunxl/does_anyone_recognize_what_this_song_is_from/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1fyunxl/does_anyone_recognize_what_this_song_is_from/">[comments]</a></span>
