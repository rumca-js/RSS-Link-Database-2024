<p>Cue my jealousy as my favorite headphones — which I paid full price for — go on sale for <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-prime-day/">Amazon Prime Day</a>. They also happen to be Engadget's favorite <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-headphones-wireless-bluetooth-120543205.html">wireless headphones</a> at the moment. The Sony WH-1000XM5 are currently available for $298, which is roughly $100 off and close to a record-low price. Best of all, the discount applies to all color options: black, midnight blue, silver and smoky pink. We gave the WH-1000XM5 a <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-wh-1000xm5-review-160045478-160045458.html">95 in our review</a> when Sony released them in 2022, and they are still holding up against all their newer competitors.</p>

<p>X is coming back online in Brazil after officials lifted a ban that took the service offline for five weeks. Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://noticias.stf.jus.br/postsnoticias/stf-autoriza-o-retorno-imediato-do-x-e-determina-que-anatel-adote-providencias-para-a-retomada-do-servico/"><ins>said Tuesday</ins></a> that regulators could “take steps to resume the platform&#39;s service” as the company had complied with the court’s demands.</p>

<p>Social media can play a critical role in spreading information (and misinformation) during a crisis. In an effort to promote the former and curb the latter, the White House has started getting active on Reddit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/whitehouse/">profile</a> was created on January 7, 2021, the day after insurrectionists stormed the Capitol in Washington DC. However, today was the first time the account did any public posting. All of the posts from the White House profile today have been sharing information related to relief efforts in response to Hurricane Helene and Hurricane Milton, which have been causing devastation along the east coast of the US. So far, the content shared on Reddit is very similar to what the official White House team is <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://x.com/WhiteHouse"><ins>posting on X</ins></a>.</p>

Because we are Engadget, we're focusing on Lego sets from the Super Mario, Star Wars and Harry Potter lineups. Some of which are on sale for up to 41 percent off. There are even steeper savings on general Lego sets as well.

<p>The October version of <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-prime-day/">Prime Day</a> has arrived, but some of the best deals are already selling out. Case in point: both variants of the PS5 Slim have dropped by $50, but at least one of them is not currently available at Amazon. Thankfully, rival retailers are picking up the slack.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>To back up: The PlayStation 5 is still a hot commodity nearly four years after its debut. While the $700 <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/sony-unveils-its-ps5-pro-console-which-will-cost-you-a-whopping-700-151636487.html">PS5 Pro</a> is perhaps a little too on the pricey side, the svelte PS5 "Slim" line have all the power of the original PS5 units but in a more slender form factor. Given how chunky those first models were, that's nothing to sniff at.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Normally starting at $449, the PS5 Slim Digital Edition (the one without a disc drive) has dropped to $39

<p>Pour one out for the Surface Duo 2. As <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/phones/the-surface-duo-is-dead-microsoft-pulls-plug-on-usd1-500-surface-duo-2-after-just-one-android-os-upgrade"><em>Windows Central </em>points out</a>, Microsoft has pushed out what will almost certainly go down as the device’s final software update, a security patch, ahead of its October 21 end-of-support date.</p>
<p>When Microsoft debuted the Surface Duo 2 in October 2021, the company pledged to provide three years of software updates for the dual-screen device. Since then, the company has released just one platform update for the Duo 2, upgrading it from Android 11 to Android 12L. By comparison, Surface Duo users were more fortunate. They got to see their devices make the jump from Android 10 to Android 11 and then later to Android 12L. I’ll note here that the latest version of Google’s mobile operating system is <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mo

Each lawsuit was filed individually. The suits, which are led by the attorneys general of New York and California, say the platform violated the law by “falsely claiming its platform is safe for young people.”</p>
<p>The lawsuits spotlight what the plaintiffs call “addictive” features. These include the kinds of things present with many modern social media apps, like 24/7 notifications and autoplay videos.

<p>The Vegas Loop, underground tunnels built by Elon Musk’s Boring Company that snake underneath Sin City, hasn’t been the traffic or even technological game changer the company promised it would become. It was supposed to be a futuristic, autonomous people mover that looked like public transit from the <em>Tron </em>universe.

## Sony will delist LittleBigPlanet 3 and its DLC on October 31

<p><em>LittleBigPlanet 3</em> has been around for a long time. The beloved game was released in November 2014 for both the PS3 and PS4. But after just about a decade, gamers won’t be able to purchase it and its DLC after October 31 because Sony will <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://x.com/LittleBigPlanet/status/1843652568389480651"><ins>delist it</ins></a>.</p>
<p>To be clear, the game and DLC won’t be available for purchase anymore after the end of the month, but you can still keep your copies and enjoy them. Sadly, ever since the PS4 servers were <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://x.com/LittleBigPlanet/status/1781427669801820406"><ins>shut down</ins></a> back in April this year, fan-created levels that weren’t already saved locally aren&#39;t available to download and play anymore. At this point, you’re limited to the base game — something worth playing, but much of the game’s charm came from all its user-generated content.</p>

<p>Amazon’s <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-prime-day/">October Prime Day sale</a> is here, and it includes several noteworthy price drops on well-reviewed TVs. Not all of the discounts are exclusive to the two-day event, and it’s entirely possible that things will drop lower as we get closer to Black Friday. For now, though, we’re seeing all-time low (or at least near-low) prices on recommended sets from LG, Samsung, Sony, Hisense and more. Below we’ve rounded up the best October Prime Day TV deals we can find, and we’ll update this post as we find more. Just note that you need to be a Prime subscriber to access some of the discounts.</p>

## Most US TikTok users aren’t following political accounts, study says

<p>As TikTok faces the possibility of a ban in the United States, a new study sheds light on the type of accounts US adults follow on the platform. According to the report, published by Pew Research, political content and news are only a small fraction of the accounts US adults follow in the app.</p>
<p>The report is based on an analysis of 227,946 accounts followed by 664 TikTok users who participated in the study. Of those accounts, less than one percent were “politicians, civic actors or traditional media outlets and journalists,” Pew found, noting that “the typical U.S. adult on TikTok follows no accounts in each of these categories.”</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Instead, people were more likely to follow accounts that posted about entertainment and pop culture, humor and viral dance clips. “To the extent Americans’ followed accounts discuss politics, it tends to be mixed with other topics,” Pew writes. “Some 43% of all followed accounts that discussed politics or

<p>Instead of cramming more technology into its Quest VR headsets, which would inevitably escalate their price, Meta has taken the opposite approach with the Quest 3S. It's a slightly bulkier, slightly less sharp version of the Quest 3 starting at $300, almost half off that headset's $500 launch price. The Quest 3S pitch is clear for consumers and developers alike: It's a more powerful and feature-rich budget device than the now defunct Quest 2, and since it has the same processor and GPU as the Quest 3, developers don't have to worry as much about supporting older headsets either.</p> <core-slideshow data-slideshowid="923bf1bd-f8a1-4c0b-8609-aab61dfe9c12" /> 
<p>Based on my brief hands-on time with the Quest 3S (our full review is in the works), it's easy to see how this could be another hit for Meta. Despite its lower price, it doesn't look or feel inferior to the Quest 3 at first. The only noticeable external difference is that it uses a triangular array of sensors up front, instea
