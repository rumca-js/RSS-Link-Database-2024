SARS-CoV-2 has an enzyme that can counteract a cell's innate defense mechanism against viruses, explaining why it is more infectious than the previous SARS and MERS-causing viruses. The discovery may point the way to the development of more effective drugs against this and possibly similar, future diseases.

Peptides formed during cheese ripening are crucial for the full-bodied flavor of aged cheeses, known as kokumi. A research team led by the Leibniz-Institute for Food Systems Biology at the Technical University of Munich has now developed a new method to analyze these flavor-relevant peptides precisely, quickly, and efficiently. Based on more than 120 cheese samples, the team has also created a database that can be used in the future to predict flavor development during cheese ripening.

## Crucial role of cerebellum in social and cognitive functioning

Scientists shed light on the often-overlooked role of the cerebellum in both motor and social-cognitive processes. His research contributes to a growing shift in the field of neuroscience, which has traditionally focused on the cerebrum. For decades, the cerebellum was primarily associated with motor coordination.

## Scientists discover how fungi interact with soil actinomycetes

In a recent study, researchers investigated the interactions between Pyricularia oryzae, the rice blast fungus, and the beneficial soil bacterium Streptomyces griseus. They found that P. oryzae significantly increased the pH of the growth medium, promoting the growth of S. griseus even without direct contact. These findings highlight the importance of soil microbial interactions, paving the way for development of environmentally sustainable biocontrol strategies for plant diseases.

## Study highlights complexity of menopausal hormone therapy's impact on brain health

A study suggests that menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) might have moderate effects on brain health, but this depends on past surgical history, the duration of treatment, and a woman's age at last use.

## People with type 2 diabetes who eat low-carb may be able to discontinue medication

Adults with type 2 diabetes on a low-carbohydrate diet may see benefits to their beta-cell function allowing them to better manage their disease and possibly discontinue medication, according to new research.

## Dangers of the metaverse and VR for US youth revealed in new research

Research of online victimization in the metaverse is sorely lacking. A new study explored harm in the metaverse and VR devices among a sample of 5,005 U.S. teens aged 13 to 17. Findings show a significant percentage of youth reported harm in these spaces, including hate speech, bullying, harassment, sexual harassment, grooming behaviors (predators building trust with minors), and unwanted exposure to violent or sexual content. The study also revealed notable gender differences in experiences, emphasizing the need for protective strategies in virtual environments.

## Showing AI users diversity in training data boosts perceived fairness and trust

While artificial intelligence (AI) systems, such as home assistants, search engines or large language models like ChatGPT, may seem nearly omniscient, their outputs are only as good as the data on which they are trained. However, ease of use often leads users to adopt AI systems without understanding what training data was used or who prepared the data, including potential biases in the data or held by trainers. A new study suggests that making this information available could shape appropriate expectations of AI systems and further help users make more informed decisions about whether and how to use these systems.
