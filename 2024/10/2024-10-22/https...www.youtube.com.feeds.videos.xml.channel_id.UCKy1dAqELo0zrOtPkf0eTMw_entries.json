Its story and characters are underwritten, its ravaged urban playground is eye-catching but not particularly surprising to explore, and its combat fails to evolve enough to keep the fights interesting over the course of the journey. The occasional room-rocking escape sequences do literally shake things up, but they\u2019re few and far between and only distract from the otherwise uncomplicated platforming for short bursts at a time. Kong and his kind may hail from an alternate world hidden deep inside the Earth\u2019s core, but the actual gameplay of Kong: Survivor Instinct is strictly one-dimensional.\"", "id": 1368453, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPlwdWwpQTQ", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 149, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/hPlwdWwpQTQ/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Kong: Survivor Instinct Review", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-10-22T14:00:44+00:00", "description": "Get your first look at the mysterious town of Theddon in this new, exclusive gameplay clip from Square Enix's upcoming Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake.

I greatly appreciated the many handcrafted human touches that made its evacuated spaces so evocative, and the safety net of its consistent auto-save meant that my numerous instant deaths never became a source of frustration. However, although it may maintain a regularly tense atmosphere every shuffled step of the way, the absence of any significant story surprises or enough substantial changes to its simplistic stealth-based gameplay means that A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead doesn\u2019t quite have enough twists and turns to make for an unmissable journey.\"", "id": 1366239, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_lKv-MgjLA", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 149, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/N_lKv-MgjLA/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead Review", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-10-22T01:31:05+00:00", "description": "Take a look at the gameplay reveal for Squadron 42, a third-person cinematic narrative-driven space-flight simulation combat experience within the Star Citizen universe.
