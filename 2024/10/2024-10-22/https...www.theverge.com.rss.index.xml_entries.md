  <p id="U6xfxS">Even with most of its autonomous vehicle fleet on ice, Cruise is still bleeding cash. The robotaxi company that is a wholly owned subsidiary of General Motors lost $435 million in the third quarter of 2024, <a href="https://investor.gm.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gm-releases-2024-third-quarter-results-and-updates-full-year">GM reported this morning</a>.
