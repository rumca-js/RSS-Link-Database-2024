For those of you who played without much background in economics, did it actually help you grasp economic concepts?</p> <p>The game looks quite complex to set up, and most reviews seem to come from experienced players who already have a strong understanding of both economic decision-making and game mechanics. If you\u2019ve played it as an economics beginner, I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts. Did it really make things clearer, or did the complexity get in the way of learning?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/nemo4now\"> /u/nemo4now </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1g9nety/did_hegemony_teach_you_economics_or_not/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1g9nety/did_hegemony_teach_yo", "id": 1370135, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1g9nety/did_hegemony_teach_you_economics_or_not", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 473, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Did Hegemony Teach You Economics or Not?", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-10-22T17:09:00+00:00", "description": "<table> <tr><td> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1g9ncbb/just_a_heads_up_but_clank_is_now_on_steam/\"> <img src=\"https://external-preview.redd.it/s6uMHE32pRQ9XiySYyh0z9NLKthuCsfcBaBt-NFx4QU.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=594d585fe451bfd69a7be28fa2c8c377a6855b73\" alt=\"Just a heads up but Clank! is now on Steam\" title=\"Just a heads up but Clank! is now on Steam\" /> </a> </td><td> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/spidey555\"> /u/spidey555 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/1722870/Clank/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1g9ncbb/just_a_heads_up_but_clank_is_now_on_steam/\">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>", "id": 1370136, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1g9ncbb/just_a_heads_up_but_clank_is_now_on_steam", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 473, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://external-preview.redd.it/s6uMHE32pRQ9XiySYyh0z9NLKthuCsfcBaBt-NFx4QU.jpg?width=320&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=594d585fe451bfd69a7be28fa2c8c377a6855b73", "title": "Just a heads up but Clank! is now on Steam", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-10-22T17:07:26+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi, we lost robotics v3 card with rules.

I don&#39;t mind learning the rules for a game I&#39;m passionate about (in fact i quite enjoy it) but with the amount of games we play I constantly have to make room in my head for more. That means I tend to forget rules from older games which I learned a while ago and since we don&#39;t meet up too often that includes relearning at least some chunks of it. And that&#39;s the part I hate. Relearning rules. So now I have a shelf full of games that I love but which are played so infrequently that bringing them to the table just annoys me because I can&#39;t for the love of it keep it all in mind. Since I am the one owning all the games and mostly hosting BG nights I can&#39;t really pass that on to others.
