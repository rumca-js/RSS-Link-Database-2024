<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello,</p> <p>I purchased the Jasmine table on July 2023 and received it in late January 2024. We‚Äôve been using the table since late February 2024. </p> <p>We live in a small house and the table is our actual every day dinner table and let me tell you how disappointed are we with this purchase. Since the moment I opened the pack everything has been an issue. Parts were missing, the instruction manual was very confusing but the most disappointing issue with the table are the wobbly legs and the time that Allplay have taken to make it better.</p> <p>When communication started about the defective legs they told the backers: ‚Äúdon‚Äôt move the table‚Äù or ‚Äúlift it as you move it‚Äù, but for us the table as been in the same spot since built and we‚Äôve been using it for dinning and gaming. Then they offered replacement legs on April and as of today, at least I haven‚Äôt receive them since ordered. Consider that this was as soon as they offered it 5 and a half months

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have played Kelp a few times now (~6 times). Once as the octopus, the other times I was the shark. </p> <p>I feel like the shark doesn‚Äòt really have any decisions. Sure, you can decide where to swim to and where you attack etc, but it feels like after you get and roll the dice, it is almost always pretty obvious what to do. </p> <p>On the other hand, the octopus has lots of strategic options - first off, they can choose between three actions. If they play a card, they can choose between up to 5 cards. If they switch or shuffle they have endless options. Then, they can learn and have many options there. </p> <p>I just feel like the octopus does more than the octopus during the turns. </p> <p>How do you feel about this ‚Äûproblem‚Äú? Have you noticed it? Am I missing something? What is your Kelp experience?</p> <p>ü¶ëü¶à</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/AdaWuZ"> /u/AdaWuZ </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This weekend I&#39;m hosting a murder mystery that I&#39;ve been creating over the last couple of weeks. I&#39;ve gotten a lot of the tidbits accomplished but would love some input on the dynamic of things. A couple things to note: 1) I&#39;m doing this freeform style, where we all mingle organically and find clues/solve puzzles. 2) The setting is a gothic manor, where each year a group of occult scholars/aristocrats gather for a private gala. Our victim (not a playable character) is unveiling a powerful artifact and many see this as reason for murder. 2) There are 11 characters (plus myself as the hostess and husband as the detective). </p> <p>So now, here&#39;s a few of the things I&#39;m mulling over:</p> <ol> <li><p>I initially wanted all 11 characters to have their own clues/red herrings, but that may be overboard/unnecessary.

Like just enough to spark interest and then some just abruptly ended. I probably put too much expectation there, and unfairly compare it to other games similar...but yeah.</p> <p>The dice felt under utilized....I know they are used for more than just dice poker but it would be nice to see them implemented broader.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey!</p> <p>So within our group I&#39;m pretty much the &quot;rules guy&quot;. I don&#39;t mind learning the rules for a game I&#39;m passionate about (in fact i quite enjoy it) but with the amount of games we play I constantly have to make room in my head for more. That means I tend to forget rules from older games which I learned a while ago and since we don&#39;t meet up too often that includes relearning at least some chunks of it. And that&#39;s the part I hate. Relearning rules. So now I have a shelf full of games that I love but which are played so infrequently that bringing them to the table just annoys me because I can&#39;t for the love of it keep it all in mind. Since I am the one owning all the games and mostly hosting BG nights I can&#39;t really pass that on to others. Besides I noticed that whenever other friends learn the rules they tend to make mistakes or not know them too well. I honestly don&#39;t know what the point of my post is.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m looking for an Unlock! style game to bring camping and play with one other person, but I really would prefer something that is totally tech-free-- no app components like the Unlock! games. The problem with phones is that once you have them out, you tend to look at them. Or at least I do.</p> <p>My experience: * Unlock! : really love these games. Played a lot of them before covid; haven&#39;t played any in the last few years. My intro to the genre. Not great here due to needing a phone. * Exit : Found these after Unlock! Less of a fan because I really really cringe at the destruction aspect, and I feel like the decoder limits the ranges of puzzles. But they fit the tech-free aspect. * Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective: I&#39;ve run through the first book; looks like there are more now including an Arkham one. Might be ok, although a very different sort of puzzle and I definitely have come up with solutions I liked a lot better than the canon

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m looking into the Hexplore It series. I know there is a gamefound going on for the 5th volume but I don&#39;t guess I knew a lot about the series in general. It looks like something I would really enjoy but not sure about the longevity of each volume and if things carry over from volume to volume? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/thearchadian"> /u/thearchadian </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1g99vw5/curious_about_hexplore_it/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1g99vw5/curious_about_hexplore_it/">[comments]</a></span>
