<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I recently came across a new app that feels like a mix between RSS feeds and a social network. It’s called <strong>HVR</strong>, and it essentially combines browsing with social features, giving you the best of both worlds. Instead of just following websites through traditional RSS, you can follow people, websites, and hashtags, and see all their updates in a feed.</p> <p>You can also comment directly on any webpage, and those comments show up in your followers&#39; feeds, which adds a conversational layer to browsing. It’s kind of like an RSS feed, but with the ability to interact, discover new content, and stay connected with people who share your interests—all in one place. Definitely worth checking out if you&#39;re into a more interactive way of staying updated online.</p> <p><a href="https://hvr.world/">https://hvr.world/</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/akiinnibo"> /u/akiinnibo </a> <br/

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi. There&#39;s a news site that has a page with flash news. Each singular news flash is a sentence, but if you click it there&#39;s an extra sentence that elaborates. There&#39;s also a radio button for simply showing all the news flashes&#39; extended versions. I&#39;d like to make an RSS feed of the expanded news flashes. Is this possible?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/BadWolf2077"> /u/BadWolf2077 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1g9lg48/creating_an_rss_feed_from_a_web_page_after_an/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1g9lg48/creating_an_rss_feed_from_a_web_page_after_an/">[comments]</a></span>
