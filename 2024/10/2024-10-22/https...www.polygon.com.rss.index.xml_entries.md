<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>“Spiritomb Challenge”</strong> is the latest opportunity to get a Spiritomb in <em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/pokemon-go/38713">Pokémon Go</a></em>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As with every <a href="https://www.polygon.com/e/467904">Halloween event</a>, there is new research to catch a Spiritomb — and, as always, the steps are themed around the number 108.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Alongside the time-limited research, there’s also <em>other </em>ways to catch Spiritomb this year. This means you can side step this quest entirely, or ideally, encounter more than one to increase your chances of getting a shiny Spiritomb.</p>
