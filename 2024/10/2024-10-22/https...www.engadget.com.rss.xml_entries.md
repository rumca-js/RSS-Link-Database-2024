<p>Microsoft has just announced its <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/10/22/xbox-wireless-headset-evolution/">new Xbox Wireless Headset</a>, and it now comes with a free Dolby Atmos license. Previous iterations of the headset required owners to purchase a license separately. That’s typically a $15 purchase, which covers up to 10 Windows or Xbox devices. Another notable upgrade is its battery life, which, according to Microsoft, has increased to 20 hours of playtime.</p>

<p>WhatsApp just announced that it’ll soon let users add contacts from any device, and not just a primary phone, thus solving one of life’s little annoyances. A forthcoming update will let people add and manage contacts via the web client, on a Windows PC and “eventually other linked devices.”</p>
<p>Users will also be able to save a contact exclusively to WhatsApp without syncing to a phone, which is useful when sharing a handset with others or for those who manage both work and personal WhatsApp accounts on the same device. Meta says that this will also solve the problem of people losing all of their contacts when they misplace a phone, as the contacts will be fully restorable.</p>

The company says it will send a replacement adapter soon and asks users to return the faulty one. Both the replacement and the shipping cost to send back the original will be free of charge.</p>
<p>It’s another high-profile stumble for Ford, especially since this adapter was delayed several times already due to supplier issues. Plus, it’s not as if these adapters are toys, given they’re hooking up to Superchargers capable of pumping out 250kW. Ford must also be smarting that it had to sign a charging pact with Tesla in the first place and will adopt NACS as its charging standard in
