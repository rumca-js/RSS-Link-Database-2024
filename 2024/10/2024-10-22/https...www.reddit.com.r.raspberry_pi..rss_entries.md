<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So, I&#39;ve had a 4gb raspberry pi 4 for about 18 months. </p> <p>I originally bought it to replace a pi 3 a+ I accidently shorted some components on, that was running Retropie. </p> <p>However, I decided to move Retropie to an old core i5 laptop. </p> <p>That left me a pi4 with no immediate use. However, I had an original 2012 pi 1 running pi hole, so decided an upgrade was in order. </p> <p>My pi 4 now runs:<br/> lighttpd web server.<br/> pi hole.<br/> sftp server over the internet.<br/> CCTV control centre.<br/> Ampache music server over the internet.<br/> Raid 1+0 array<br/> Transmission torrent box.<br/> network monitor. </p> <p>just need to find a use for the pi 1 now</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/fozid"> /u/fozid </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1g9sqb6/what_my_raspberry_pi_4_does/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ra

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I use my Pi5 (4gb) as a desktop replacement computer in the garage and it works really well for this. I&#39;m using the Ubuntu desktop version that is specifically designed for the Pi (can&#39;t remember the version but it&#39;s the one you can get from the official download) and it does almost everything I ask of it except it can&#39;t deal with large PDF files without crashing hard.</p> <p>I have a couple parts catalogs in PDF format that I use quite often in the garage and one is 800 mb and the other is about 1 GB. If I try to open any of these on my Pi5 it freezes up and crashes. Anyone have a workaround? Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ourkid2000"> /u/ourkid2000 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1g9pm5i/large_pdf_crashes_pi5/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1g9pm5i/large_pdf_crashes_pi5/">[co

Could this harm anything at all? I realized they’re aren’t meant to be plugged in together.
