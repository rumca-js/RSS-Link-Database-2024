Nonetheless, he appeared on CNBC to discuss why he is America first while also explaining why he's not.</p><div class="rm-embed embe

All of that is true. The difference is that Donald Trump has culturally appropriated all of Kamala Harris's vibes and joy.  She's boo-boo faced and stuck hanging out with Liz Cheney. Trump is almost having TOO much fun, and the Left and the media (but I repeat myself) f*cking hate it.
