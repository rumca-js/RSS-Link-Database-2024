Something to convert the RTSP to a format a web browser can display. </p> <p>I believe open stream platform(OPS) or restreamer may work but not sure if they will be ideal. I started to setup up OBS but the idea of using YouTube/twitch to handle the webpage side of stuff doesnâ€™t sound ideal and may break TOS.

I&#39;m curious, why is that?</p> <p>I understand that hosting on a VPS isn&#39;t truly self-hosting since you&#39;re depending on a provider, but I&#39;m a bit hesitant to host on something like a Raspberry Pi due to its low RAM and CPU. Plus, there&#39;s the higher risk of downtime from power outages or other home network issues.</p> <p>So, why do you choose to host at home despite these potential drawbacks? Is it about control, privacy, cost savings, or something else?

## Seeking open-source solution for managing Apple Notes via IMAP without mail clients limitations

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I decided to use Apple Notes on my iPhone because, after trying many apps, I find it the most efficient and with the best support for RTL languages. Since I don&#39;t want to use the only cloud syncing compatible with Apple Notes which is iCloud, I found a workaround, I can sync Apple Notes through IMAP using my custom domain email configured in Apple settings. This way, notes will appear in a dedicated folder in Mail. However, mail clients and apps like Thunderbird handle notes as emails, and exporting them to txt was a nightmare when notes are not in Latin languages alphabet. Is there an open-source app I can host on my server to manage and sync these types of IMAP notes as modifiable entries rather than emails?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/wa_00"> /u/wa_00 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1g9j7x8/seeking_opensource_solution_for_managing_apple/">[link]

I originally build the server using TrueNAS because I wanted to use it for a file server. Then I realized you could run apps on it, and I ended up running a few that have turned out to be very useful.</p> <p>Well, now TrueNAS is making some changes and going to Docker apps in their future releases. I have a couple docker apps running now on my current system despite the somewhat limited functionality.</p> <p>Yesterday I started looking into self-hosted cloud file storage. I started playing with FileCloud and may try out NextCloud as well. For FileCloud, there was no native &quot;app&quot; for that in TrueNAS, so I just spun up a quick RHEL VM on my desktop, installed docker, and installed it there. It worked great and was really painless. It got me thinking though, if/when I build a new serve

The script I made creates a configuration backup of a Pi-hole instance by using the command-line version of the Teleporter. Then, with rsync the backup is copied over to a destination of your choice (e.g. a NAS) and with cron this is repeated on the first day of every month.</p> <p>A log file of the transfer is generated and also placed in your backup destination directory. And finally, in the interest of saving space, only the last four backup files created by the Teleporter are kept and synced over.</p> <p>All of the details can be changed to your liking (e.g. how often the backups are made, how many backup files are kept), so modify away!</p> <p>Please take a look at the Github repo here:<br/> <a href="https://github.com/jlar0che/Pi-hole-Automated-Backup-Solution">https://github.com/jlar0che/Pi-hole-Automated-Backup-Solution</a></p> <p>Thank
