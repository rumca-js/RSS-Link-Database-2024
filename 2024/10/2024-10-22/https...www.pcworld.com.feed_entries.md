<p>I think we’re rapidly approaching the point where 1080p monitors will be a relic of the past — and as a multi-monitor addict, I’m here for it.</p>



<p>If you’re ready to make the upgrade but you’re on a budget, Amazon is selling a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dell-S2725DS-Monitor-2560x2440-Integrated/dp/B0D3FGFPPB/">27-inch 1440p IPS monitor by Dell for just $150 today</a>. That’s a hefty $70 discount off its retail price.</p>



<p>The Dell S2725DS is a fairly basic design, but its upgraded size, resolution, and IPS panel (a step above the usual budget VA designs) make it great for anything that needs color accuracy, like editing photos or videos. It offers dual HDMI connections (one of which is weirdly hidden behind a plastic panel) and DisplayPort to boot. This model doesn’t have any extra USB ports, but the USB-C variant (model S2725DC) is <a href

## Custom ‘CubeSense’ PS5 controller is a gorgeous GameCube throwback

<p>The Nintendo GameCube from 2001 had the best controller ever designed, and yes, I <em>will</em> die on this hill.</p>



<p>Yet while it’s easy enough to get a new controller with that classic shape and button layout, one modder decided to go the extra mile and fuse the classic look and feel of the GameCube with all the bells and whistles of the PS5’s DualSense pad.</p>



<p>The “CubeSense” by <a href="https://www.killscreen.io">custom controller seller Killscreen</a> nails the iconic purple base color and mix of red, green, and gray for the accents. But it also replaces the PlayStation stock thumbsticks with one that has concentric rings (on the left) and an all-yellow “nub” C-stick (on the right).</p>



<p>Also note the shoulder buttons: gray for primary triggers, but only the right R1 button gets the “base” purple color (because the GameCube pad lacke

<p>Facebook and Instagram have a problem. Well, they have many, many problems, but one of the ones they feel like addressing is “celeb-bait ads and impersonation.” According to a <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2024/10/testing-combat-scams-restore-compromised-accounts/">new post from parent company Meta</a>, the way they’re going to try solving this is through the use of facial recognition technology. Again. Woo.</p>



<p>In the lengthy post, Meta explains that the biggest impact of these new tools will be an expanded effort to stop scam accounts from impersonating celebrities. If you’ve used Facebook in the last year or so, you’ve probably encountered friend suggestions for attractive celebrities, which are obvious fakes that can be identified by their paparazzi photos and deliberate misspellings of their names.</p>

<p>Just a decade ago, few people really knew how damaging a sedentary desk job could be for one’s health. From carpal tunnel to herniated discs to muscle aches everywhere, plus the need to mainline tea or coffee all day, it turns out that being an office worker can be seriously bad for personal wellness — and chronic back pain tends to be the worst of it.</p>



<p>Fortunately, unlike in most physical labor jobs that can be literally back-breaking, office workers can make changes and improve habits to reduce the bodily strain that comes from working at a desk. And if you find it hard to incorporate such changes, tech accessories can really help.</p>

<p>Intel’s new Lunar Lake hardware is a reflection of modern chip design. </p>



<p>It’s tempting to call it a “processor” or “CPU” — old habits die hard, after all — but it’s really a system-on-a-chip (SoC), both in terms of architecture and philosophy. The CPU cores are joined by integrated GPU cores, a neural processing unit (NPU), and even on-chip RAM. Also, unlike past Intel chips, Lunar Lake seems set on striking a balance between the three.</p>



<p>That’s keenly felt in Intel’s approach to Lunar Lake’s integrated graphics (iGPU). Building on the success of Intel Core Ultra, Intel’s new processors also offer Intel Arc — but this time around, Intel has returned to providing each iGPU a name unique to its configuration, and the best version here is the Intel Arc 140V with eight Xe Cores and a max frequency of 2.05GHz.</p>

<p>Qualcomm has attacked Intel for “misleading” claims the company has made in marketing its Lunar Lake processors, with the former citing PCWorld’s own Snapdragon and Core testing as evidence.</p>



<p>In a presentation to reporters, Qualcomm cited PCWorld’s video review, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QB1u4mjpBQI&t=2s">“Did Intel Just Save X86?”</a>, as a source for its refutation, including benchmark scores that Qualcomm claimed could only be obtained using samples of Core Ultra Series 200 (Lunar Lake) laptops that were sent to reporters, not sold on the open market.</p>



<p>Qualcomm executives used the video by PCWorld’s Gordon Mah Ung as evidence, precisely because he was able to obtain two virtually identical laptops from Dell, with the same capacity, battery, and screen size. The two laptops differed only in their choice of processor, a re
