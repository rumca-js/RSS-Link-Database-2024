A recent study reveals that three asteroid families—the Karin, Koronis, and Massalia—are responsible for around 70% of the meteorites that land on Earth. These families, formed from past collisions in the main asteroid belt, have a higher number of fragments due to their relatively young age. The findings shed light on the origins of meteorites, indicating that younger families are more likely to send debris toward our planet. Understanding these sources helps scientists assess potential risks associated with larger space objects.
