<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone! Iâ€™m working on a large project related to security and anonymity in the darknet. Weâ€™ve already defined the siteâ€™s structure and design, which is being developed in Figma. Iâ€™m looking for a programmer to help with the technical side of the project. We have a clear vision of how the site should look and function, and Iâ€™d be happy to share more details. We can discuss everything in detail in private messages. The project is unique and ambitious. I can offer a partnership with equity, as well as project management to ensure its success. Looking forward to discussing potential collaboration!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Last_Ad_2974"> /u/Last_Ad_2974 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/Last_Ad_2974/s/zKQcJ8YVgK">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1g9d02k/darknet_security_and_anonymity_project/">[comments]</a></span>
