I colorized with new technique, restored and applied face restoration and created a sound design for this video of Moscow 1908,


Video Restoration Process:
âœ” FPS boosted to 60 frames per second 
âœ” Image resolution boosted up to HD 
âœ” Improved video sharpness and brightness 
âœ” Colorized only for the ambiance (not historically accurate)
âœ”added sound only for the ambiance
âœ”restoration:(stabilisation,denoise,cleand,deblur) 
âœ”face restoration

Please, be aware that colorization colors are not real and fake, colorization was made only for the ambiance and do not represent real historical data.
