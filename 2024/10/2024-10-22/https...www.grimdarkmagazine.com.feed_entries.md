<p>One of the latest vampire films to hit the market, its release perfectly timed to make the most of the spooky month of October, is The Radleys, directed by Euros Lyn. You can catch it in the UK in a limited cinematic release, or if you subscribe, on Sky Cinema or NOW TV.  I started watching The Radleys with no more knowledge than the trailer gave me, and my strong-held opinion is that Damian Lewis, who plays two characters in this film, is a great actor, so it should be worth watching. Now, had I known before that The Radleys is an adaptation of a contemporary fiction novel, not a horror novel, I would have had very different expectations about it. But I didn’t have that knowledge prior, and as the film went on, it became apparent that this film was less horror and more dark comedy with some blood spatter. As someone who was after a dark and brooding vampire film (and considering that the synopsis describes it as a ‘vampire thriller’), I find that The Radleys was not the best film
