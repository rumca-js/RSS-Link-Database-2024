<p><strong>The Design Museum, London<br></strong>This world-touring exhibition showcases the kooky, gothy director’s early passions and obsessions – but he’s no Edgar Allan Poe</p><p>In Tim Burton’s film Ed Wood, the gloriously talentless titular director of Plan 9 from Outer Space meets Orson Welles, his polar opposite in ability. Welles was the ultimate “auteur”, a film-maker who imposed a singular vision through all his productions. Is Burton too an auteur, as the Design Museum’s director has it, and as this efficiently kooky show takes for granted? If he is, then he has by now turned the gothic into a brand, projecting such a sharply stylised, recognisable version of homely horror that he can imprint it on almost any material and deliver the outlandish as bankable.</p><p>This exhibition is a world touring event originally devised by Burton’s “in-house curatorial team” that is making its final stop at the Design Museum in London. That accounts for the easily packed-up look of it al

<p>From safe-cracking to arms-dealing and coup-causing, David Tomkins has spent 40 wild years fighting other people’s wars for money – and thrills. You honestly couldn’t make it up</p><p>Storyville has long provided must-see documentaries – and Dogs of War, the astonishing tale of David Tomkins, a mercenary and arms dealer (“legal and illegal”), is yet another. For 40 years, Tomkins fought other people’s wars for money. His career, which began in Angola in the 1970s, took him to almost every global conflict hotspot of the late 20th century.</p><p>This is such an extraordinary tale that even the brief montages that flash up the countries in which Tomkins operated – Kuwait in 1981, Nigeria in 1982, Lebanon in 1983, Iraq, Iran, Syria and beyond – are thrilling, a time capsule of geopolitical manoeuvring. The film asks questions about justice and repentance, the mercenary industry in general and Tomkins’ moral compass.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/oct/22/dogs

<p>A murder trial ends with an unresolved question: can officers maintain public trust and operate effectively while being held accountable?</p><p>This week, there was a pivotal moment in Britain’s debate over police shootings, as a jury <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/21/martyn-blake-met-police-officer-who-shot-chris-kaba-acquitted">acquitted</a> a police officer of murdering a young Black man in south London. The case raises questions about how the police can operate effectively and with public confidence while being held accountable for any improper actions. Such deaths leave Black families grieving and officers resentful for being put on trial. The 2011 shooting of another Black man led to the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/ng-interactive/2020/jun/10/mark-duggan-shooting-can-forensic-tech-cast-doubt-on-official-report">biggest riots</a> in modern English history.</p><p>The hope is that no such unrest follows the acquittal of the Metropolitan pol

<p>Pyongyang may be moving away from its Juche dating system, but others cling to their own kinds of time despite the Gregorian supremacy</p><p></p><p>In one regard – and one regard only – North Korea appears to have moved somewhat closer to global norms. Several state media outlets have abruptly <a href="https://www.nknews.org/2024/10/north-korea-drops-juche-calendar-in-apparent-bid-to-elevate-kim-jong-uns-legacy/">abandoned their use of the Juche, or “self-reliance”, calendar</a>, giving only Gregorian dates. Days before, they had also placed North Korea in the year 113, since the Juche system begins with the birth of the country’s first leader Kim Il-sung in 1912 – though it was not adopted until 1997 (or the year 86).</p><p>The onward march of the Gregorian calendar, first across western Europe and then the globe, appears relentless. Yet a handful of countries hold out. Iran&nbsp;and Afghanistan use the solar and lunar Islamic Hijri calendars respectively, placing their citizens i

<p>Tough-on-crime brigade look scarce as convicts win a break from crumbling prison system</p><p>There are times when even the Tories are banged to rights. Prisons are one of them. You’d have thought Conservative MPs would have been up in arms at the government’s decision to free a second tranche of prisoners under its early release scheme little more than a month after the first. Law and order is meant to be a Tory thing. The answer to any crime – apart from inciting rioters to burn down buildings with asylum seekers in them – is to lock people up and throw away the key. Turn the whole of Milton Keynes into one vast prison estate. Bring back capital punishment.</p><p>But not this time. As the justice secretary, Shabana Mahmood, prepared to give a statement to the Commons on Tuesday, there were just seven Tory backbenchers in the chamber. And none of the Reform crew. Presumably with the presidential election imminent, they have more interest in what’s going on Stateside. Or maybe Nige

<p>Keen to show off their newfound riches, and to kick back at a society that suppressed them, Roma families are filling rural Romania with exuberant symbols of wealth – boasting gilded turrets and gleaming staircases that lead to nowhere</p><p>In the village of Hășdat in the heart of rural Romania, geese roam the dusty streets, bonfires burn in back gardens, and the houses are not quite what you would expect. Not at all. One sports a pair of golden Versace Medusa heads and Rolex crown emblems on its tall metal gates, flanked by marble pillars topped with trios of cherubs. They mark the entrance to a compound where a creamy stuccoed pile groans with balconies and plaster mouldings, its roof dripping with ornamental guttering. A group of women stand around a table in its courtyard, plucking feathers from freshly slaughtered chickens behind a fence of gilded scrollwork.</p><p>Across the street, the neighbours have gone even further.

Mykytenko, a lieutenant in the Ukrainian army, also feeds the street cats, pets abandoned by residents who fled, and has her own cat.

Ah, yes, I love the Requiem.

There’s that great symphony – the one that goes da-da-da DAA.”</p><p>Glorious though <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xZbnY5jQSk">Fauré’s Requiem</a> and Pavane are (along with his other best-known works, such as the first violin sonata and first piano quartet), there are whole other worlds to his music that deserve to be far better known.

<p>Netflix thriller looks back at the stranger-than-fiction tale of a serial killer who was a contestant on a 1970s dating show</p><p>“I am serving you for dinner,” said Cheryl Bradshaw, “What are you called and what do you look like?” Bachelor number one, Rodney Alcala, replied: “I’m called the banana and I look really good … Peel me.” Bradshaw burst into laughter and so did the studio audience.</p><p>This was a seemingly innocuous episode of the television show <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058795/">The Dating Game</a> in 1978. Bradshaw, able to put questions to three contestants but unable to see them, selected Alcala, a longhaired photographer who enjoyed skydiving and motorcycling in his spare time. What she could not know was that she had booked a date with one of the most prolific serial killers in American history.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/oct/22/woman-of-the-hour-true-story-netflix">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Pulsating with tidal energy, the Dublin-based poet’s imaginative first collection is a harrowing wake-up call shot through with optimism</p><p>Some therapists ask their clients, “What colour do you associate with that thought?” It is a popular approach for visualising and tackling problems. Flynn innovatively explores this technique with regard to ecology. What image of the future can humans conjure and hold? Are we hurtling towards darkness or instead into the light?</p><p>The collection’s initial pessimism is difficult to swallow – the future is a “black cup of loneliness”, half empty, not half full. Ice caps bleed out, stranding penguins on glacial shards. Bees disappear. The apocalypse arrives. This vision fades to grey as plumes of pollution rise, before then blazing red with record temperatures and clouds of blood. The future is a charred kaleidoscope of chaos, recalling the bushfires in the poet’s Australian home town.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/oct/

But the British prodigy is less interested in virtuosity than connection – and chasing an ineffable ‘shimmer’</p><p>When Oliver Coates was 19 or so, he got a job playing cello on a cruise ship. “Quite a bow tie, buttoned-up kind of space,” he recalls. The ensemble would be playing The Swan by Camille Saint-Saëns, a very slow, sad piece. As the boat rocked, Coates had to work out how to lean into his instrument to counterbalance the sway. “I remember thinking, God, this is technique!” he says with typical verve. After his shifts, he would return to his cabin to “get stress relief through doing my <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/aphex-twin">Aphex</a>-y glitchy music, and that was my fun”.</p><p>It is a very literal early example of the slippage, as he likes to call it, that defines Coates’ endlessly fertile approach to music.

Eckhart plays a hitman named Evan Shaw; clearly a bit of a dolt, Shaw thinks he works for a super-specialised unit within the CIA that dispatches him to assassinate bad guys by sending him coded messages in the classified ads in newspapers (very retro). Shaw never sees his boss, Kevin (Tim Roth, clearly not taking this seriously) although a flashback reveals they used to have dinner together once in a while. Still grieving his late wife, Monica (Marysia S Peres, also seen in flashbacks), Shaw devotes himself to his lonely, murderous work, passing through airports, picking up suitcases with high calibre rifles at lost property offices, ki
