Your Kubernetes production environment is essential. And Kubernetes has added the Gateway API, a family of APIs that provide dynamic infrastructure provisioning and advanced traffic routing, a natural fit to the NGINX Open Source web server.

In this webinar, learn how the NGINX Gateway Fabric (NGF), built on the powerful open source NGINX data plane, can make your Kubernetes environment more secure and reliable and add even governance to your application deployments. 
 
During this talk, youâ€™ll:
- Learn why you should care about the Gateway API and the evolution of the NGINX Ingress Controller. 
- Get insights into why NGINX is evolving from its ingress controller to embrace the Gateway API.
- Discover how NGINX Gateway Fabric simplifies app and service connectivity and visibility via the Gateway API and NGINX One.
