<p>In an effort to improve Java performance in cloud environments, an OpenJDK proposal is afoot to reduce the size of the <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2256197/what-is-the-jdk-introduction-to-the-java-development-kit.html">JDK (Java Development Kit</a>) by about 25%. The plan calls for enabling the <code>jlink</code> tool to build custom runtime images without using the JDK’s <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/tools/jmod.html">JMOD</a> files.</p>



<p>The JDK Enhancement Proposal (JEP), titled <a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/493">Linking Run-Time Images without JMODs</a>, is motivated by the desire to reduce the installed size of the JDK on the file system in cloud e

<p>Elon Musk-backed generative AI venture, xAI, has unveiled a new API service for its Grok models to allow developers to underpin their applications and agents with xAI’s large language models (LLMs).  </p>



<p>Musk took to Twitter, now X, to announce that the API service was live and shared a link where developers could sign up for the service.</p>



<p>xAI API, currently in the public beta phase, is akin to OpenAI and Anthorpic’s API services that allow developers to call large language models such as <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2104578/openai-announces-new-multimodal-desktop-gpt-with-new-voice-and-vision-capabilities.html">GPT-4o, GPT-4o mini</a>, <a href="https://www.comp

Many now realize that the initial allure of unlimited storage and processing power often comes with unforeseen costs and complications.</p>



<p>Historically, the cloud was championed for its promise of scalability and flexibility. Most enterprises have since encountered a reality starkly different from the marketing hype. Although many companies apply different metrics, the actual costs of operating applications and storing data in the cloud are at least 2.5 times what enterprises h
