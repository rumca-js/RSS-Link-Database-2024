While C++26 aims to introduce introspection and code generation via P2996 and P3294, Rust&rsquo;s approach using its derive macros offers a mature solution for code generation, even without introspection, highlighting different philosophies in language design and their practical applications.</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<h3>\n\t\t<a href=\"https://brevzin.github.io/c++/2024/09/30/annotations/\">Code Generation in Rust vs C++26</a></h3>\n\t<p>\n\t\tby Barry Revzin</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tFrom the article:</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\tOne of the things I like to do is compare how different languages solve the same problem &mdash; especially when they end up having very different approache", "id": 1369879, "language": null, "link": "https://isocpp.org//blog/2024/10/code-generation-in-rust-vs-cpp26-barry-revzin", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 29, "page_rating_contents": 90, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 314, "source_url": "https://isocpp.org/blog/rss/category/news", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Code Generation in Rust vs C++26 -- Barry Revzin", "vote": 0}]
