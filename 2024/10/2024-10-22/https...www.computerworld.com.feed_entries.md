<p>Artificial Intelligence continues to dominate this week’s Gartner IT Symposium/Xpo, as well as the research firm’s annual predictions list. </p>



<p>“It is clear that no matter where we go, we cannot avoid the impact of AI,” Daryl Plummer, distinguished vice president  analyst, chief of research and Gartner Fellow told attendees. “AI is evolving as human use of AI evolves. Before we reach the point where humans can no longer keep up, we must embrace how much better AI can make us.”</p>

<p>We waited three years for <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3564678/apple-powers-up-the-ipad-mini-for-apple-intelligence.html">Apple to update the iPad mini</a>, and what we got is more of the same — boosted with a much better processor. Apple’s iPad mini has consistently been positioned as either the most versatile, or the most underpowered tablet in the company’s lineup. That’s changed with the latest iteration, which remains small enough to take anywhere, but also becomes much more powerful than ever, thanks to a new A17 Pro chip. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Whole lotta processor</strong></h2>

<p>Generative AI is on track to transform entry-level roles across industries, with 64% of leaders expecting these positions to evolve from creation to review and refinement of outputs within the next three years. The percentage of managers holding a similar view stood at 71%, according to new research from the Capgemini Research Institute.</p>



<p>The findings suggest the traditional model of junior employees manually creating content, data, or code is rapidly being replaced by <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2338115/what-is-generative-ai-artificial-intelligence-that-creates.html">generative AI</a>, which can generate these outputs in a fraction of the time. As a result, employees in

<p>Saying the legal profession is document-intensive is like claiming that a library is filled with books. Unlike researchers using the Dewey Decimal System, though, lawyers face an ocean of big data from which they must fish out case evidence.</p>



<p>For more than a decade, law firms have been using machine learning and artificial intelligence tools to aid the discovery process, helping them hunt down paper trails and digital content alike. But it wasn’t until the arrival two years ago of OpenAI’s generative AI (genAI) conversational chatbot, <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/1639341/openais-chatgpt-turns-one-year-old-what-it-did-and-didnt-do.html">ChatGPT</a>, that the technology
