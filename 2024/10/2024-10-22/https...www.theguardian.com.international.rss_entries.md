<p>Mats Steen had muscular dystrophy and died very young. But a touching new documentary has used animation and his own posts to reveal the fulfilling gaming life he led in World of Warcraft – right down to his first kiss</p><p></p><p>The night after their son Mats died aged just 25, Trude and Robert Steen sat on the sofa in their living room in Oslo with their daughter Mia. They couldn’t sleep. “Everything was a blur,” remembers Trude of that day 10 years ago. “Then Robert said, ‘Maybe we should reach out to Mats’ friends in World of Warcraft.’”</p><p>Mats was born with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a progressive condition that causes the muscles to weaken gradually. He was diagnosed aged four and started using a wheelchair at 10. By the end of his life, Mats could only move his fingers, and required a tube to clear his throat every 15 minutes. As he became increasingly disabled, he spent more time gaming: 20,000 hours in his last decade (about the same as if it were a full-time job).

On this occasion, he’s headed in the opposite direction, as a grandfather with dementia sent back to 1497 after finishing a round of a Jumanji-style magical game with his family. The film is based on the card game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Werewolves_of_Millers_Hollow">Werewolves of Millers Hollow</a>, but manages to be not too cynical for a giant extended advert, with a certain bubbly spontaneity.</p><p>Despite his house being transmogrified into a timber cottage, Gilbert (Reno) finds that his mind has been restored after crash landing in the medieval era.

Now back in Dakar, he is trying to persuade young fishers not to make the same journey, helping them instead to set up small businesses. But with fish stocks dwindling due to EU trawlers operating off Senegal's coast, work has evaporated and many are increasingly desperate, with more and more choosing to risk it all for the chance of a better life</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2024/oct/22/europe-is-not-paradise-one-mans-mission-to-stop-senegals-youth-dying-at-sea-video">Continue reading...</a>

Something was clearly wrong, and Navalny staggered to the&nbsp;bathroom.</p><p>There, he recalls, he had the grim realisation: “I’m done for.” He told a&nbsp;sceptical steward that he’d been poisoned and then lay down calmly in the aisle, facing a wall. Life didn’t flash before his eyes. Instead, he compares his experience of death – or near-death, as it turned out – to something from a dark fantasy.
