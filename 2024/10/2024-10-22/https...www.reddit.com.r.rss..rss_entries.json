It\u2019s called <strong>HVR</strong>, and it essentially combines browsing with social features, giving you the best of both worlds. Instead of just following websites through traditional RSS, you can follow people, websites, and hashtags, and see all their updates in a feed.</p> <p>You can also comment directly on any webpage, and those comments show up in your followers&#39; feeds, which adds a conversational layer to browsing. It\u2019s kind of like an RSS feed, but with the ability to interact, discover new content, and stay connected with people who share your interests\u2014all in one place. Definitely worth checking out if you&#39;re into a more interactive way of staying updated online.</p> <p><a href=\"https://hvr.world/\">https://hvr.world/</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/akiinnibo\"> /u/akiinnibo </a> <br/", "id": 1369596, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1g9lmgf/new_app_rss_feed_aggregator_social_network", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 482, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "New App: RSS Feed Aggregator + Social Network", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-10-22T15:51:17+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi.
