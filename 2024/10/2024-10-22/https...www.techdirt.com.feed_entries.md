And, frankly, what Intuit just decided to do to itself must surely be one of the most explosive and idiotic examples of the Streisand Effect I&#8217;ve ever come across. Readers here will be familiar with our posts about Intuit. [&#8230;]

Let’s be honest, Christopher Rufo is the ratfucking king. While I don’t agree with him about anything, when it comes to dirty tricks, nobody does it half as good as him, he’s the best. Whenever Rufo releases a new report, the &#8220;woke&#8221; tremble, and pray he’s targeting someone else. Rufo’s current crusade is focused on [&#8230;]

The Fifth Circuit Appeals Court continues to hand down dumb decisions rewarding law enforcement for rights violations. And the Supreme Court &#8212; yes, this Supreme Court &#8212; keeps sending those decisions back for a do-over. In December 2017, Laredo PD officers arrested local independent journalist, Priscilla Villarreal, for the alleged crime of &#8220;misusing official information.&#8221; [&#8230;]

Often when internet companies change their terms of service, there will be a short freakout from people overreacting and not really understanding the language of what’s in there. We see these stories every so often, frequently around things like licensing terms (which sites are effectively required to have to get permission to host user-generated content). [&#8230;]

The Supreme Court&#8217;s Carpenter decision created a warrant requirement for obtaining location data from service providers.
