<p>The <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/10/22/giuliani-getting-his">aforelinked piece</a> on Rudy Giuliani losing his possessions to pay the two Georgia election officials he was convicted of defaming made reference to the dispute regarding his four World Series rings, from the Yankees championships during his time as mayor, in 1996, 1998, 1999, and 2000. The current dispute is over Giuliani’s deeply suspicious claim that he gave the rings to his <a href="https://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/andrew-ruins-rudy-giulianis-inaugural-address-cold-open/2860970">nitwit son</a> Andrew in 2018, so they’re no longer his for the court to take.</p>

  <p>A federal judge on Tuesday ordered former Donald Trump attorney
and New York mayor Rudy Giuliani to turn over all his valuable
possessions and his Manhattan penthouse apartment to the control
of Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss, the Georgia election workers he
defamed and to whom he now owes $150 million.</p>

<p>Judge Lewis Liman of the federal court in Manhattan said Giuliani
must turn over his interest in the property to the women in seven
days, to a receivership they will control. The judge’s turnover
order of the luxury items is swift and simple, but the penthouse
apartment will have its control transferred so Freeman and Moss
can sell it, potentially for millions of dollars.</p>

<p>The women, who counted Georgia ballots after the 2020 election,
will also be entitled to about $2 million in legal fees Giuliani
has said the Trump campaign still owes him, the judge ruled.</p>
