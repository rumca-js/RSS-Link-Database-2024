When a magnitude 4.8 earthquake struck northern New Jersey's Tewksbury township on April 5, it triggered widespread alarm as the biggest event since 1884. Based on existing models, it should have done substantial damage at its epicenter, but that didn't happen. Meanwhile, relatively distant New York City shook much harder than expected, causing damage, albeit minor. Outsize shaking extended all the way to Virginia and Maine. A new study suggests why this happened, calling into question some assumptions about regional earthquake hazard.

To understand how these large snakes can regenerate their intestines without intestinal crypts, scientists sequenced the RNA genes of pythons. By learning more about this process in reptiles, researchers hope to better inform other scientists working to improve the diagnosis and treatment of gastrointestinal diseases in humans, including diabetes, Crohn's disease, celiac disease, and cancer.

## U.S. infant mortality increased 7 percent in months following Dobbs, researchers find

U.S. babies died at a higher rate in the months following the Supreme Court's 2022 Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health decision, and infant mortality was highest among those born with chromosomal or genetic abnormalities, new research has found. The findings mirror previous research analyzing the experience in Texas after a ban on abortions in early pregnancy and illuminate the consequences of restricting access to abortion care, said researchers who conducted the national analysis.

## Scan based on lizard saliva detects rare tumor

A new PET scan reliably detects benign tumors in the pancreas, according to new research. Current scans often fail to detect these insulinomas, even though they cause symptoms due to low blood sugar levels. Once the tumor is found, surgery is possible.
