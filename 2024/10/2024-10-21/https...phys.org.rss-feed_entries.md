A novel customizable OpenGUS immunoassay that detects analytes quickly and effectively has been developed by scientists from Science Tokyo. With specially designed β-glucuronidase (GUS) probes and optimized reaction conditions, this platform provides a hassle-free yet extremely sensitive approach for detecting relevant biomarkers, allergens, or other biomolecules. This makes homogenous immunoassays more widely available for point-of-care diagnostics, high-throughput testing, environmental monitoring, and food safety analysis, even when sophisticated laboratories are unavailable.

A growing number of students in public schools—right now, about 15% of them—are eligible for special education services. These services include specially designed instruction for students with autism, learning or physical disabilities, or traumatic brain injuries. But going into the current school year, more than half of U.S. public schools anticipate being short-staffed in special education. Dr. Kimber Wilkerson, a professor of special education and department chair at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, explains why there's a shortage and what needs to be done to close the gap.

However, a new artificial "nose" inspired by our sense of smell could now make it possible to detect undiagnosed disease, hazardous gases, and food that is starting to spoil. And it is all made possible with technology that already exists.

The UK government has given the go-ahead to carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) schemes worth £22 billion (US$28.6 billion). Critics are insisting that this technology—which involves capturing carbon as it is emitted or taking it back out of the atmosphere, then pumping it into rocks deep underground—is unsafe, unproven and unaffordable. Defenders are responding with painstaking rebuttals.

The Guardian and antifascist group Hope Not Hate have revealed the existence of a new network of far-right intellectuals and activists in an undercover investigation. Called the Human Diversity Foundation (HDF), this group advocates scientific racism and eugenics. Although it presents itself as having a scientific purpose, some of its figureheads have political ambitions in Germany and elsewhere.

Plants control their water consumption via adjustable pores (stomata), which are formed from pairs of guard cells. They open their stomata when there is a sufficient water supply and enough light for carbon dioxide fixation through photosynthesis. In the dark and in the absence of water, however, they initiate the closing of the pores.

In many low and middle-income countries (LMICs), working horses are essential to daily life, supporting industries such as agriculture, transport, and construction. The welfare of these horses is closely tied to the livelihoods of the communities they work with, making their health crucial for both human and animal welfare.

A hiker's pack usually gets lighter over time as they plow through trail mix and water, but Annika Dechert likes to joke that hers gets heavier. As an Earth sciences graduate student at the University of Oregon, she's picking up clues to the eruption history of South Sister volcano in the Oregon Cascades, helping scientists better understand its possible future risk. Those clues: 10-pound chunks of crystal-studded rocks, ejected during past eruptions spanning 39,000 to 2,000 years ago and hauled off the volcano by Dechert and a team of volcanologists.

Colistin is a last-resort antibiotic that is usually only used for severe infections with resistant bacteria. This is due to its severe kidney-damaging side effects, which occur in about 30% of treated patients. A research team at the Helmholtz Center for Infection Research (HZI) and the German Center for Infection Research (DZIF) has now been able to produce an inactivated, harmless form of colistin that is only activated in the body with the help of chemical switches.
