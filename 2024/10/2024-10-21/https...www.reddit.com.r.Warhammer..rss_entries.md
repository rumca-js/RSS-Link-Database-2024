<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone, looking for some advice here! A friend of mine recently got into Warhammer and started his collection with a box of <em>Primaris Intercessors</em>. He then picked up the <em>Kill Team Blooded</em> set and mentioned he&#39;s interested in trying out the Kill Team format because it&#39;s an easy entry into playing the game. He&#39;s a big fan of the lore, so he&#39;s not focusing on optimizing for the most powerful army—he just enjoys armies that have a strong narrative flavor (bonus if there was some queer/homoerotic aspect involved in the lore).</p> <p>For example, while he liked the mechanics and playstyle of Chaos Space Marines, he said he doesn&#39;t like how they look, so aesthetics definitely matter to him.</p> <p>Now I’m planning to get him a gift for his birthday or Christmas, and I’d also like to pick up something for myself so we can play together (or against each other). I’m looking for suggestions.</p> <p>What are your thought
