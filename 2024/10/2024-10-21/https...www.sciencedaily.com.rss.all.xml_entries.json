Based on existing models, it should have done substantial damage at its epicenter, but that didn't happen. Meanwhile, relatively distant New York City shook much harder than expected, causing damage, albeit minor. Outsize shaking extended all the way to Virginia and Maine. A new study suggests why this happened, calling into question some assumptions about regional earthquake hazard.", "id": 1364666, "language": "en-us", "link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/10/241021145726.htm", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 188, "source_url": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/rss/all.xml", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Shaking from April's sizable New Jersey earthquake traveled strangely far", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-10-21T13:32:45+00:00", "description": "Scientists have discovered the earliest evidence of animal butchery by humans in India.", "id": 1363783, "language": "en-us", "link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/10/241021133245.htm", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 188, "source_url": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/rss/all.xml", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Rare fossils of extinct elephant document the earliest known instance of butchery in India", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-10-21T12:33:08+00:00", "description": "Researchers have made a groundbreaking discovery in understanding how air pollution forms at the molecular level.
