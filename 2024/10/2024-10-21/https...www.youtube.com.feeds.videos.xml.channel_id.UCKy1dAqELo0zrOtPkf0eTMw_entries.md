In today's Daily Fix:
Almost as soon as the playtest began, details for Nintendo's mysterious online Switch game started leaking online, including screenshots‚Äîwhich were immediately taken down. But descriptions of what the game is have survived the Nintendo copyright purge, and apparently it's a co-op sim building game that sounds like Minecraft-meets-Miiverse. In other news, Insomniac Games has confirmed that there are no plans to release story DLC for Marvel's Spider-Man 2, but hopes are still alive that they'll do a smaller game like the Miles Morales title that was released in 2020, only this one would presumably star Venom. And finally, we have story details on the new Batman: Arkham Shadow game, coming exclusively to Meta Quest 3 and Meta Quest 3S.
Presented by Batman: Arkham Shadow. Only available on Meta Quest 3 and 3S.

## We might see more of Venom someday üëÄ

In an exclusive coming out of New York Comic Con from Collider, the media outlet reported that Avengers: Doomsday will officially begin filming in the spring. This comes from Joe Russo, one of the directors of the upcoming Marvel film and of the famed Russo Brothers. The film will mark the return of actor Robert Downey Jr. to the MCU as Dr. Doom, and will also feature the Fantastic Four. We‚Äôll see Reed Richards, Sue and Johnny Storm, as well as The Thing in next year's The Fantastic Four: First Steps. As for who else we can expect to see in the upcoming Avengers movie: The Thunderbolts and Benedict Cumberbatch‚Äôs Dr. Strange are all confirmed to make an appearance in the movie. Avengers: Doomsday is slated to release in May of 2026, so it won‚Äôt be too long before we see Robert Downey Jr‚Äôs return. But the question is, will his villainous character be teased well before its release? It seems very likely we‚Äôll see Dr. Doom make an appearance or get mentioned in The Fantastic Four First St

Get a deep dive into the world and Atomfall gameplay in this latest trailer for the upcoming single-player first-person action survival game. The trailer introduces you to the story setting in the North of England based on the Windscale disaster of 1957, locations in Atomfall, your mission, the threats you'll face, various weapons, and more. Atomfall will be available on PS4 (PlayStation 4), PS5 (PlayStation 5), Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and PC in March 2025. 

Atomfall is inspired by the real-life events of the 1957 Windscale disaster and the story picks up five years later in a fictionalized quarantine zone that encompasses rolling countryside, valleys, caves and even a picturesque English village. 

But this picture-perfect postcard setting is a hostile landscape that hides a dark mystery. To get to the bottom of what happened at Windscale, you will need to navigate military encampments, delve through abandoned bunkers below ground, and risk your life in Pagan ruins.

## Sonic X Shadow Generations Review

Sonic X Shadow Generations was reviewed by Jada Griffin on PlayStation 5. Also available on PlayStation 4, Xbox, Switch, and PC. 

Sonic X Shadow Generations takes an already excellent game and spring jumps it to new heights at a blistering pace by doubling up the campaign length with creative level design, fantastic bosses, plenty of collectibles, and an appreciable graphical upgrade. While the brand-new Shadow content isn't necessarily long on its own, it adds a nice change of pace to the collection of all-time great Sonic stages Generations already contained, and there‚Äôs an exciting new story that‚Äôs filled in as you explore the overworld for collectibles, activities, and challenges. This bulked-up remaster soars far and above previous enhanced versions we've gotten in the Sonic franchise, and hopefully will be the gold standard Sega holds itself to when it decides to bring back other Sonic games from the past.
