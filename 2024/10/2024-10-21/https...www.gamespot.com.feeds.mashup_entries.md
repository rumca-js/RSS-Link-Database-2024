<p>Marvel's superhero movies tend to be very expensive, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/deadpool-and-wolverine-review-status-quo/1900-6418260/">Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</a> was no exception with a reported $200 million budget. It's not unusual to wonder where all of that money is going, but we do know about $100,000 of that total went toward one of Hugh Jackman's alternate Wolverine costumes.</p><p>The scene in question came early in the film, while Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds) was visiting alternate worlds to find a replacement Wolverine. One of Deadpool's stops found a Wolverine in his classic comic-book-inspired tan-and-brown outfit during his battle with the Hulk. That costume was only onscreen for under a minute, but it was still extremely costly to realize, according to Deadpool &amp; Wolverine editors Dean Zimmerman and Shane Reid.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4387443-4387442-h

<p>A number of Call of Duty: Black Ops games over the years have had multiple endings, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-release-date-beta-and-more-leak-ahead-of-xbox-showcase/1100-6524072/">Black Ops 6</a> will not continue this tradition.
