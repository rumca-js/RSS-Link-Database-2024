<p>This spoof from a team of comedy greats ends up a bit of a mess – largely due to the lack of great jokes. But one actor comes up with the goods</p><p>It is a strange truth that to satirise something effectively, you have to love it – at least a little. You have to see it in the round and understand not just where it fails but where it succeeds, and why some people like it while others loathe it. Good satire doesn’t come from indifference: it comes from disappointment, rage and the desire to show not just how things fail but how they&nbsp;could be better.</p><p>Jonathan Swift wrote about people eating babies because he was furious.

<p>London’s award-winning Elizabeth line is an example of what can be achieved.

Spacious, fast and pleasing on the eye, the east-west addition to the capital’s underground network is a triumphant example of modern civic infrastructure. As this newspaper’s architecture and design critic put it, here was proof positive that “Britain is still capable of pulling off gargantuan transport infrastructure projects with style and panache”.</p><p>Sadly, beyond the south-east – and particularly in the north – such feelgood moments have been notable by their absence.

The day he arrived at Real Madrid in 1958, he was 31 years old, 18kg overweight and, banned by Fifa for defecting after the Hungarian uprising, hadn’t played football for two years. He couldn’t possibly go on a pitch like this: signing me is all well and good, he told the club’s president Santiago Bernabéu, but have you <em>seen</em> me? “I was the size of a large balloon,” he recalled and the coach, Luis Carniglia, didn’t know what to do with him either.

<p>The Bavarians’ big win against Stuttgart shows just how much things have changed since Thomas Tuchel’s tenure</p><p>Build it and they will come. That had been the message coming out of Bayern Munich’s corridors of power over the international break, from Vincent Kompany, Max Eberl and the higher-ups. If there had been a fortnight’s worth of heel-kicking it was just that; not stewing, not sulking, but a belief that Bayern were ready to unload on an opponent, with the excellence and exhilaration of their play so far this season bound to reach critical mass.</p><p>Even for a club constantly walled in by hyperbole and overreaction, the description of the team’s pre-international break run of three games without a win as Kompany’s first “mini-crisis” had felt faintly ludicrous. For starters, they were still unbeaten in the Bundesliga and top of the table. The mood suggested a determination to correct course, rather than recrimination and fury. “For me it isn’t a matter of belief,” Kompa

<p>From the Tories’ Thatcher fixation to Labour’s Blair fetish, ideas from the past are poisoning the political present</p><p>The pop culture of past generations weighs like a dark cloud on the youth of today. Teenagers may have their own subcultures but the mainstream is all nostalgia. The big films are sequels, remakes or long-running sagas. The most watched shows on Netflix are 90s sitcoms, or paeans to the past like Stranger Things. The main stage at Glastonbury is full of OAPs performing tribute acts to their youth. The top music story of 2024 is the return of Oasis, a band whose songwriter was born during the Wilson administration.</p><p>This is all a function of the internet, which makes the past ever-present in easily accessible form, leaving little space for the new or innovative. In a slightly more subtle way it’s doing the same thing to politics, with more severe consequences than Champagne Supernova being played incessantly on the radio.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardia

<p>Researching a novel about forgotten blues musicians led me to revisit the life’s work of my late dad: disinterring decades of dusty recordings that will outlive us all</p><p>My dad, Michael Brooks, was an archivist, a music salvage expert. He worked deep into old age at Sony’s New York office: curating the company’s labyrinthine back catalogue; sourcing and restoring antique steel recordings. Possibly, we all circle back to the songs of our youth, but Dad went upriver and made the past his profession. On workdays he sat in a Manhattan studio and listened to the dead sing and play on a two-track Studer tape deck.</p><p>Sony Music is a behemoth, the industry’s biggest hitter, with annual earnings of about $10.7bn (£8bn) and a lineup of talent (Springsteen, Beyoncé, Jackson, Bowie) that reads like a rock’n’roll hall of fame. But Sony’s marquee names are only the tip of the iceberg. For every Diana Ross, Johnny Cash or Billy Joel who struck gold, there were a hundred other signed artis

<p>Nice performances from the leads aren’t enough to save this comedy about a bawdy bike courier from floundering in a slew of crass sex jokes</p><p>Cheap and pretty charmless, this low-budget British comedy combines kids’ telly naffness with crass sex jokes. It’s really quite tawdry and the knob gags just don’t get any funnier, but there are a couple of quite nice performances. Brandon McCaffrey is a likable lead playing a hopeless loser who gets his life on track with a new job as a bike courier for a Deliveroo-style app. And a certain level of likability is definitely required to pull off lines like: “I’d love to get that much hanky panky. For me it’s all hanky wanky.”</p><p>McCaffrey plays Tim, who introduces himself in a voiceover as 25 years old, gay, unfit and unemployed. Flatmate Jade (Billie Hindle, nicely deadpan) suggests he gets a job working for the delivery app Wallaby and Tim is sold on the idea when he meets a Wallaby courier who tells him how much sex you can get on t

<p>Aston Villa are grateful for their No 1, West Ham have problems and Eddie Howe is under the pump</p><p>Curtis Jones’s all-action display against Chelsea was all the more impressive, given that the Liverpool midfielder and his partner have a newborn daughter at home – and he slept in the spare room before Sunday’s game. Called in to cover for Alexis Mac Allister, who picked up a knock on Argentina duty, Jones brought energy to Arne Slot’s midfield in an outstanding box-to-box display. He kept Cole Palmer quiet, might have won two penalties with runs into the box (the second was overturned by VAR) – and was in the right place again to poke home a second-half winner. Jones’s form will be a big boost for Slot with a brutal run of fixtures set to test the depth of his squad. The 23-year-old is surely overdue an England senior debut, having been part of the recent Nations League squad. Jones is the kind of dynamic midfielder Thomas Tuchel may be looking for, and more game time for Liverp

<p>After his old band split, Fleming struggled to launch a solo career – then the pandemic forced him to confront his mental health and addiction issues. The reckoning prompted a miraculous back-to-basics record</p><p>In 2019, a year after his band Wild Beasts had split, Tom Fleming toured his debut solo album as One True Pairing. It was, by his account, a “fucking awful” experience, with only a couple of well-attended shows. “It was really difficult,” he admits. “Putting Wild Beasts on tour was like putting an army in motion. I wanted to go back to basics. But even then, it was obvious: this is not right and I’m not in any fit state.”</p><p>The baroque Kendal four-piece had gone out on a high after five brilliant albums, two of which hit the UK Top 10, three glorious farewell gigs, no animosity – they’re still friends – although Fleming, who was the gruff vocal foil to the more florid Hayden Thorpe, wanted to continue. “If one person doesn’t want to be there, you haven’t got a quarte

A Scottish-London trio comprising Elizabeth Fraser, Robin Guthrie and Simon Raymonde, their enigmatic appeal was heightened by the fact that Fraser appeared to be singing in a language all her own, while the music – often gossamer-light and celestial – sounded like it should be pouring down cathedral walls.

<p>Trying to get some redress from green energy installers when things go wrong is a long, hard slog</p><p><strong>Two years ago I signed a £14,409 contract for a heat pump installation and paid the deposit. Three weeks after the pump was fitted, the company that installed it, </strong><strong>Omni Heat and Power</strong><strong>, went into liquidation. It had been due to return to repair damage to the pump’s casing, and I had not yet paid the&nbsp;balance. I paid the pump manufacturer Grant Engineering UK to do the repairs and, as I had not received the promised seven-year guarantee from Omni, I decided to purchase an extended warranty from Grant.</strong></p><p><strong>Within two months, the pump developed a fault and kept switching off, leaving us without heating or hot water. Several technician visits and a £1,000 flushing of the system did not help.
