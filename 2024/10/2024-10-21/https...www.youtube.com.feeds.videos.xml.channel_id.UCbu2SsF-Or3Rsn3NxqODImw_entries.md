Sonic X Shadows Generations is a celebration of a specific era of Sonic games, for better and worse. 

Sonic X Shadow Generations is two games: a remaster of a game from 2011 and a brand-new game for 2024. And yet, both games feel oddly similar, building most of their levels on the backbone of Sonic games from the 2000s. In that respect, they carry forward some of the shortcomings of those Sonic games, like unnecessary extra mechanics and a bland story, but at the same time, they do well what those games excelled at: delivering fun platforming gauntlets accompanied by memorable music and an exhilarating sense of speed.

Omnimovement means the kids are getting faster this year and as an old-school Call Of Duty player it’s time to even the playing field. Here’s how to compete and have fun when reflexes aren’t everything. 

Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 has added new movement systems that let you sprint, slide, and dive in any direction and you know it’s a matter of time until the kids find high-speed ways to race around the map doing 360 no scopes. It’s time to stop playing their game and embrace your many years of wisdom as well as your lack of reflexes. 

In this video we’re going over Recon builds, how to stay off the radar, using unlimited knife sprint like your CS: GO days, settings to change to read the field easier, and how to level guns ahead of time. We’re also covering how to play support with shotguns, LMGs, and launchers, why map knowledge can make pying angles still relevant but also where to aim when the kids start leaping off of corners. Finally, we’ll discuss a few mind games you can play w

## I'm Not Convinced Horizon Makes Sense As A Lego Game | Hands-On Preview

I'm just not convinced that Horizon Zero Dawn is an ideal choice to adapt to the Lego-game formula.

Having now played about an hour of Lego Horizon Adventures, it feels like a game with great ideas that are restricted by the IP it's based on. I love the world of Horizon Zero Dawn and Horizon Forbidden West, but the opening hour of Lego Horizon often feels like its setting and characters are clashing with the comedic creativity and gameplay loop that so many Lego games excel at. The opening hour of Lego Horizon feels like a pretty decent start to what's hopefully a good game--at the very least, it's shaping up to be my favorite Lego game in terms of visuals--but there are moments where I could see the kid-friendly vibe of the Lego games conflicting with the more adult-oriented storylines of Horizon.
