Professor Dalgleish and co workers have developed a simple, inexpensive preparation of heat killed bacteria, (mycobacterium vaccae and obuense). These upgrade the innate immune system to prevent a wide range of infections, and probably prevent a range of cancers. All data so far shows they are safe and effective. Only problem is the regulators refuse to licence the readily available preparation. This means doctors are unable to use compassionate prescribing to people like me who would benefit.
