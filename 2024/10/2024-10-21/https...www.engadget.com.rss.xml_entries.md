## Nintendo Alarmo review: Charming, yet frustrating

<p>Alarmo is the quintessential Nintendo product: It's a fun and quirky spin on a bedside alarm clock (with a motion sensor!) that mines your love for everything Nintendo. It's a $100 device entirely meant to surprise and delight you. But there are also usability issues that make me think the company's engineers haven't encountered any modern gadgets over the past decade (which is <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-10-29-nintendo-sleep-tracker.html">how long they've been developing Alarmo</a>).</p> 
<p>Here's an example: There's no easy way to input your Wi-Fi password if you ever want to download new themes. Instead you have to patiently spin its bulbous top button until you land on the character you need, then press it down like Mario squashing a Goomba. That may not sound like much of an issue, especially since you may only need to do it once, but it's needlessly frustrating if you have a complex password with multiple letter cases, numbers and symbols.

## Foursquare is killing its city guide app to focus on the check-in app Swarm

<p>It’s the end of an era for one of the App Store’s earliest success stories. Foursquare is shutting down its signature city guide app in order to “focus our efforts on building an even better experience in Swarm,” the company said in <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://foursquare.com/city-guide-sunset/#accordion_v2-a30f4962-5e8c-4db9-94d5-9d979522154c" data-original-link="https://foursquare.com/city-guide-sunset/#accordion_v2-a30f4962-5e8c-4db9-94d5-9d979522154c"><ins>an update</ins></a>. The app will shut down December 15, while the web version will stay online until “early 2025.”</p>

<p>Another year, another flagship Qualcomm mobile chip. But things are reportedly a bit different with the Snapdragon 8 Elite, the company&#39;s newest offering headed to premium smartphones. For one, it&#39;s using the Oryon CPU that debuted in <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/the-snapdragon-x-elite-is-qualcomms-most-powerful-chip-to-date-190004830.html">X Elite chips for laptops</a> last year, according to a <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://videocardz.com/pixel/qualcomm-launches-snapdragon-8-elite-with-oryon-cpu-cores">leaked slide from Videocardz</a>.

<p>The single-player <em>Squadron 42</em>, set in the <em>Star Citizen</em> universe, has been delayed all the way to 2026. This is interesting because the developers said the game was “feature complete” last year. <em>Squadron 42</em> was first announced in 2014 and has experienced <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-12-22-squadron-42-alpha-beta-2020-release.html"><ins>numerous delays</ins></a> throughout the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-02-01-squadron-42-to-cost-extra.html"><ins>past decade</ins></a>.</p>
<p>The stated reason for the delay is to apply more polish.

<p>The automaker will send a replacement adapter &quot;in the coming weeks&quot; and requires customers to send back the existing adapter, both at no cost. &quot;It is imperative that we receive all adapters affected to reduce the risk of potential vehicle damage,&quot; it added.&nbsp;</p>
