Fortunately, not everything the Supreme Court does these days is absolutely horrible. In this case (handled by the Institute for Justice) a Missouri man can resume his lawsuit against the officer who arrested him for&#8230; well, for reasons the cop ginned up well after the arrest had already happened. Mason Murphy was minding his own [&#8230;]

Remember a few weeks ago when Elon Musk misleadingly claimed that George Soros was secretly “buying a propaganda machine to influence how you think”? Can you imagine the kind of shitstorm that would be playing out on ExTwitter and Fox News if George Soros were out there offering $1 million per day to people to [&#8230;]

What an absolute shocker. What a completely unexpected turn of events. Oh how will we, as Americans, process this latest in a never-ending string of abuses of trust by law enforcement. What a time to be alive. Etc. Cops are always trying to hide the tech they use from criminal defendants, even when plenty of [&#8230;]

In a stunning display of technological and regulatory ineptitude, Italy&#8217;s &#8216;Piracy Shield&#8217; law has managed to block access to Google Drive, apparently confusing the popular cloud storage service with a hotbed of illegal activity. Bravo, Italy, bravo. Earlier this year, we wrote about Italy’s new “Piracy Shield” nonsense, in which the country’s telecom regulator, AGCOM, [&#8230;]

As we recently noted, the FCC has announced that&#8217;s finally &#8220;taking a look at&#8221; broadband usage caps. We&#8217;ve noted for decades how such limits are completely artificial, technically unnecessary constructs that exist specifically so your local telecom monopoly can rip you off. They don&#8217;t &#8220;manage congestion,&#8221; they exist exclusively to price gouge captive broadband customers [&#8230;]
