Ended up joining an incredible team, and we worked non-stop all weekend to bring our idea to life.</p> <p>Iâ€™m super proud of what we built and of every teammate. Itâ€™s been an amazing experience working together!</p> <p>The product makes it super easy for junior devs to create professional portfolios straight from their GitHub projectsâ€”no design skills needed, just focus on your code.</p> <p>We are finishing MVP, but core product is functional. If you are interested, shot me DM or join waitlist. </p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Absinthko"> /u/Absinthko </a> <br/>
