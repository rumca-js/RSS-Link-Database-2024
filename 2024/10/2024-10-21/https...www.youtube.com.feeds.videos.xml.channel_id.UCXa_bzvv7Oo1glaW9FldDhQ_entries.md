New World: Aeternum hopes to streamline the main storyline of the game in order to better attract new players, which is especially important since the game is also now out on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, offering full crossplay between all platforms. 

However, its central story is still quite uninspired. There is a lot of emphasis on gathering materials and the crafting system in the game. Plenty of players will find New World: Aeternum to be a great way to kill a couple of hours by just cutting down some trees. 

Unfortunately, the endgame doesn’t have too much content, and once players have cleared all the dungeons, had their share of PvP, and finished the raid, they might be left wanting more.

Coming from Montreal-based newcomer Rogue Factor, Hell is Us is a third-person action-adventure set within a war-ravaged country with something altogether more sinister and supernatural lurking in the woods. 

The game’s extended trailer, narrated by game’s Creative and Art Director Jonathan Jacques-Belletête, debuted in Sony’s State of Play, and during the presentation we were treated to in-depth overviews of the game’s backstory, exploration, and combat. 

Once the fifteen- minute gameplay preview is up, there’s nothing but intrigue left. Belletête does a great job of highlighting all the unique concepts Hell is Us deploys in terms of exploration and combat without giving too much away. This is one to watch; thankfully Rogue Factor pledge more communication surrounding Hell is Us is forthcoming prior to its 2025 release date.

Facial animations may not seem like the biggest deal in video games, especially with the amount of money that goes into crafting lush worlds, realistic textures, and compelling gameplay. However, they're vitally important, affecting a player's immersion and how characters showcase their emotions.

It's to the point now where every major triple-A game aims for realistic facial animations, whether it's a relatively lesser-priced Alan Wake 2 or Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2, eagerly-awaited remakes like Bloober Team's Silent Hill 2 and Motive's Dead Space, or mega successes like Black Myth: Wukong and Marvel's Spider-Man 2. In some cases, it can be one of the only highlights of the experience, like Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League.

Check out 15 titles with some of the best facial animations seen throughout the many decades of gaming.

The upcoming third Sonic movie is obviously going to be the centerpiece of Sega’s much-touted Yar of Shadow, but the Ultimate Lifeform is also getting his time in the sun with Sonic X Shadow Generations, which makes him the star of an entirely new campaign. 

Shadow Generations is a solid new game that delivers great level design, excellent movement mechanics, and thrilling set pieces. Meanwhile Sega has also packaged with an updated version of one of the most beloved 3D Sonic experiences in Sonic Generations, which also retains many of the strengths that endeared it to so many back when it first launched back in 2011 (even if some of its gameplay doesn’t land with quite the same impact). 

Overall, Sonic X Shadow Generations is definitely worth checking out for both new and returning players.
