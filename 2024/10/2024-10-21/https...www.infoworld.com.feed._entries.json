While competitive pressures dictated the direction, GPU cost concerns have begun moving from the back burner to the front. In conversations with leaders of these businesses, we at Kubecost find that one of the biggest concerns is the feasibility of running GPUs at scale. The pain point is generally expressed something like this: \u201cOur new AI product requires us to spend two million dollars a month on GPUs, but we have no insight into that spending. Are we using them efficiently? How much are we wasting?\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What Kubecost has now begun do", "id": 1360310, "language": "en-US", "link": "https://www.infoworld.com/article/3567046/how-kubecost-shines-a-light-on-gpu-efficiency.html", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 468, "source_url": "https://www.infoworld.com/feed/", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "How Kubecost shines a light on GPU efficiency", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-10-21T09:00:00+00:00", "description": "<div id=\"remove_no_follow\">\n\t\t<div class=\"grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column\">\n\t\t\t\t\t  <div class=\"col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"article-column__content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>They say that half the money spent on advertising is wasted, but the problem is figuring out which half. If that\u2019s true, the problem is arguably worse for AI. Talk to people deep in the AI weeds and they\u2019ll tell you upwards of 90% of money spent on AI is waste, and mountains of cash are chasing that elusive 10% because the potential payoff is so good.
