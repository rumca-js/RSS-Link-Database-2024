On this week's episode of the podcast, freeCodeCamp founder Quincy Larson interviews Tadas Petra. He's a software engineer and a Senior Developer Advocate at Agora.io. After learning embedded development in university, he switched to building mobile apps. He's gone on to build dozens of mobile apps and create tutorials to help other devs learn Flutter and other mobile dev tools.

We talk about:
- Immigrating to Chicago from Lithuania
- The Computer Engineering he studied in school, and how it's different from building consumer mobile apps
- His transition from Senior Dev to YouTube creator to Developer Advocacy
- The overlap between mobile dev and web dev, and what he's learned from each
