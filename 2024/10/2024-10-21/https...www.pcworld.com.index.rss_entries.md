<p>Qualcomm just launched its new Oryon CPUs and the Snapdragon 8 Elite at the Snapdragon Summit in Maui. While these chips might be designed for phones and not PCs, the next-gen Oryon CPU core within those chips could be headed to PCs in a future iteration of the Snapdragon X Elite.</p>



<p>Referring to the new CPU as just a “second-generation Oryon CPU core,” Qualcomm isn’t giving it a definitive name — but the company <em>is</em> making a substantive change: adding “prime” cores while also tweaking the performance of its existing performance cores.</p>



<p><strong>To be clear, Qualcomm hasn’t explicitly stated that the new Oryon cores are headed to PCs</strong>, or even that a PC version of these new Oryon cores would have the same configuration as the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2407664/snapdragon-x-elite-review-gordon-dives-deep-into-qua

<p>Knowing who’s knocking at your door is always a relief for peace of mind. And while you can know that with a simple peephole, it’s way cooler and more convenient to be able to check in remotely from anywhere using a video doorbell and a mobile app.</p>

<p>Portable monitors are a cheat code for boosting on-the-go productivity, giving you a multi-monitor setup you can fit in a laptop bag.</p>



<p>And while there are plenty of budget options out there, right now you can get <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-ZenScreen-viewable-Portable-MB166CR/dp/B0CV23K739/">this Asus ZenScreen portable monitor for just $99 on Amazon</a>. That’s a 29 percent discount off its $139 retail price.</p>



<p>This monitor isn’t especially amazing, but it packs everything you need to give just about any laptop (or even a phone or tablet) a second screen. A single USB-C provides both power and video, with the 1080p IPS panel offering enough quality for video or photo editing on the go. With standard Windows drivers, you can either mirror your laptop’s primary screen or extend your desktop into a dual display.</p>

<p>Earlier this year at the BSides Exeter security conference, Microsoft security software engineer Ross Bevington — the company’s self-proclaimed “Head of Deception” — described the exciting process by which Microsoft tricks scammers and prevents phishing attacks.</p>



<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-creates-fake-azure-tenants-to-pull-phishers-into-honeypots/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BleepingComputer</a>, Microsoft uses realistic “honeypot tenants” with access to Azure to attract cyber criminals. The company then collects data about their attack patterns in these virtual honeypots to gain a deeper understanding of how sophisticated phishing operations work and how to better mitigate criminal campaigns.</p>

<p>In order to get the most out of your CPU, you need a compatible motherboard with the best parts and settings tuned to take advantage of what your CPU can do. Gigabyte is doing just that with the latest firmware on its X870 and X670 motherboards with AM5 processor sockets.</p>



<p>Gigabyte’s new “Turbo Mode” setting allegedly improves gaming performance of the best AMD Ryzen chips by up to 35 percent. That’s the best-case scenario, of course, using <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2493399/amd-launches-surprise-sale-on-ryzen-9000-chips-teases-9000x3d-series.html">the newly announced Ryzen 9000X3D series</a> of CPUs that are launching next month.</p>



<p>But Gigabyte claims that AMD’s AGESA firmware should see significant performance gains in the Ryzen 9000X (non-3D) and Ryzen 7000 families, too. Ryzen 9000X CPUs will get a boost of up to 20 perce

<p>It may not be Black Friday, or even some version of Amazon’s Prime Day, but AMD is having a sale anyway: the company is taking up to $50 off its top Ryzen processors, just because. AMD is also confirming that next-gen Ryzen 9000 X3D parts are en route and scheduled for November 7, while providing frustratingly few details about them.</p>



<p>AMD isn’t offering any context for its actions, announcing that the discounts are an “early holiday promotion” that will take place starting October 20 and lasting an indeterminate amount of time. It’s slicing off anywhere between $30 to $50 off of the Ryzen 5 9600X, the Ryzen 7 9700X, the Ryzen 9 9900X, and the Ryzen 9 9950X.</p>



<p>The price cuts are listed below:</p>

<p>When ChatGPT first landed on the scene, I was terrified. It was <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1424575/chatgpt-is-the-future-of-ai-chatbots.html">lightyears ahead of virtual assistants like Siri, Google, and Alexa</a>, and it seemed like it was going to render my job obsolete — maybe even all jobs.</p>



<p>Fortunately, we now know that <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1787189/chatgpt-is-the-smarter-aim-chatbot-ive-always-wanted.html">ChatGPT is really just a glorified chatbot</a> and it’s far from ready to replace real-world workers, let alone take over the world. Some have even swung the opposite direction, claiming these AI chatbots are novelty gimmicks and basically useless.</p>



<p>I wouldn’t go that far, though. In fact, when I tried using ChatGPT in my day-to-day life, I was surprised by how beneficial it was. It’s a tool — and
