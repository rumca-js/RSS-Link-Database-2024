It\u2019s time to stop playing their game and embrace your many years of wisdom as well as your lack of reflexes.\u00a0\n\nIn this video we\u2019re going over Recon builds, how to stay off the radar, using unlimited knife sprint like your CS: GO days, settings to change to read the field easier, and how to level guns ahead of time. We\u2019re also covering how to play support with shotguns, LMGs, and launchers, why map knowledge can make pying angles still relevant but also where to aim when the kids start leaping off of corners.

I love the world of Horizon Zero Dawn and Horizon Forbidden West, but the opening hour of Lego Horizon often feels like its setting and characters are clashing with the comedic creativity and gameplay loop that so many Lego games excel at. The opening hour of Lego Horizon feels like a pretty decent start to what's hopefully a good game--at the very least, it's shaping up to be my favorite Lego game in terms of visuals--but there are moments where I could see the kid-friendly vibe of the Lego games conflicting with the more adult-oriented storylines of Horizon.", "id": 1361694, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To3sNAKPhGw", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 127, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/To3sNAKPhGw/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "I'm Not Convinced Horizon Makes Sense As A Lego Game | Hands-On Preview", "vote": 0}]
