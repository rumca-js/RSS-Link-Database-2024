Without a doubt Ross and Rachel were the ultimate Will They, Won't They couple on TV.  Throughout the entire run of Friends, audiences were enamored with Ross and Rachels journey, waiting to see if they would end up together.  Which is why in Season 8 when Joey and Rachel started to get together, fans of Friends were immediately turned off by the notion.  Many wonder why Friends creators would follow through with this story line, but thankfully it was very short lived.  In the end Ross and Rachel do get together, but what would Friends have been like if Rachel and Joey actually worked out?
