<p>In the ongoing war of words between Intel and Qualcomm in the low-power PC computing space, Qualcomm has fired a mammoth shot: The company is claiming that its second-generation Snapdragon Oryon CPU core is faster than Intel’s latest Core Ultra chip, Lunar Lake.</p>



<p>To be more specific, Qualcomm believes that its <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2496178/qualcomms-new-snapdragon-8-elite-chip-could-tip-a-new-pc-cpu.html">second-generation Oryon core</a>, <em>in a smartphone</em>, is faster than a Lunar Lake PC processor.</p>



<p>Cristiano Amon, the chief executive of Qualcomm, said that the new Oryon core is 62 percent faster than the Core Ultra 7 Series 2 chip, if both chips are running at the same power. If the chips were to be run at the same power, the Core Ultra would require 190 percent of the power of Qualcomm’s chip. </p>

<p>Qualcomm has been making waves in the PC world with its new crop of super-efficient Snapdragon laptops. But if you’re a software developer, odds are that: one, you already have a laptop, and two, you’d like an inexpensive way to check out these new Arm-powered PCs.</p>



<p>That’s what Qualcomm’s official dev kit mini PC was meant to be. Unfortunately, if you ordered one and you’ve been patiently waiting for yours to ship, here’s some bad news: It’s canceled.</p>



<p>Originally announced at Microsoft Build <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2024/05/qualcomm-accelerates-development-for-copilot--pcs-with-snapdrago">in May of this year</a>, the Snapdragon Dev Kit crammed a Snapdragon X Elite CPU, 32GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage into a sleek little all-black box. It was originally scheduled to ship in June, but four months later that obviousl

<p>There are impressive discounts, and then there are impressive discounts on impressively huge monitors — like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Processor-DisplayHDR-FreeSync-LS49CG954SNXZA/dp/B0C48D7Q22/">this 49-inch Samsung Odyssey OLED G9 that’s slashed down by $720 on Amazon</a>. That’s a whopping 40 percent off its original $1,800 MSRP!</p>



<p>Samsung’s Odyssey line of gaming monitors are all worthwhile picks for gamers, but this one is top-of-the-line for its OLED panel and its massive 49-inch size with a native 5120×1440 resolution. That’s equivalent to two 2560×1440 screens smooshed together side-by-side, so you could replace your dual-monitor setup with just one of these bad boys.</p>



<p>And it’s a high-performance monster, too. With its super-fast 240Hz refresh rate and 0.3ms (GtG) response time, you’ll have buttery smooth graphics and
