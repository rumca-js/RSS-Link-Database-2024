<p>When IBM announced in May 2023 that its generative artificial intelligence tools were in use by its AI assistant, watsonx, to help enterprises modernize their mainframe applications by <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2338946/ibm-watsonx-to-use-generative-ai-to-translate-cobol-code-into-java.html">translating COBOL code into Java</a>, it was just the beginning of its efforts to leverage generative AI for developers.</p>



<p>The company has taken another leap forward with the announcement on Monday of the watsonx Code Assistant for general purpose coding, based on the company’s newly announced foundation model, Granite 3.0.</p>



<p>When IBM unveiled Granite in September 2023, it tou

<p>Many enterprise engineering teams—perhaps most at this point—have dived headlong into GPUs to build out proofs-of-concept and operationalize new products. While competitive pressures dictated the direction, GPU cost concerns have begun moving from the back burner to the front. In conversations with leaders of these businesses, we at Kubecost find that one of the biggest concerns is the feasibility of running GPUs at scale. The pain point is generally expressed something like this: “Our new AI product requires us to spend two million dollars a month on GPUs, but we have no insight into that spending. Are we using them efficiently? How much are we wasting?”</p>

<p>They say that half the money spent on advertising is wasted, but the problem is figuring out which half. If that’s true, the problem is arguably worse for AI. Talk to people deep in the AI weeds and they’ll tell you upwards of 90% of money spent on AI is waste, and mountains of cash are chasing that elusive 10% because the potential payoff is so good. Accenture, for example, has <a href="https://www.ciodive.com/news/accenture-ai-data-modernization-push-julie-sweet-earnings/719398/">booked $2 billion</a> just this year to help clients make sense of AI. Nvidia and the clouds <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2337585/ai-supply-is-way-ahead-of-ai-demand.html">keep raking in tens of billions
