Trump Serves Fries While Kamala Serves Lies | Ep. 1468

Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Donald Trump clocked in to work a shift at a McDonald's in Pennsylvania over the weekend. It was a funny stunt that, of course, sent the left into spasms of rage. Also, Barack Obama absurdly claims that he handed Donald Trump a "playbook" that would have saved hundreds of thousands of lives during COVID, if only Trump had used it. Lizzo hits the campaign trail for Kamala with an interesting pitch: make America more like Detroit. And, a video that went viral over the weekend just may go down as the greatest illustration of government inefficiency ever put to film.
