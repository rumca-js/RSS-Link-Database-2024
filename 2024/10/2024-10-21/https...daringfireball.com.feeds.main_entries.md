<blockquote>
  <p>Did Nintendo try to kill <em>GoldenEye 007</em> before it was completed?

Their opponent: the Los Angeles Dodgers, who will appear for <a href="https://champsorchumps.us/team/mlb/los-angeles-dodgers/championships#tab-all-finals">the 22nd time</a>. This will be the 12th time the two teams have met in the World Series, but the first since 1981. (The Yankees won 8 of the previous 11.)
