<p>Writing anything is an exercise in vulnerability, but the fear of writing Australia and getting it wrong is embarrassing and invalidating</p><p>I’ve lived overseas for 12 years, the vast majority of my adult life. I visit Australia every year (global pandemics permitting), but I’m no longer allowed to vote. I consider Melbourne my hometown and brag about it relentlessly, but my accent has become hopelessly mangled. And though my nationality is the first line of my standard bio – <em>Mikaella is an Australian writer based in Berlin</em> – it’s rarely apparent in my actual writing.</p><p>My fiction already has a strange, hybrid quality; I write novels with my wife, Onjuli Datta, our two voices twining around one another with more than a decade’s worth of practice to create a shared language I step into as easily as my own. Onjuli is British, as is the heroine of our first novel, but if we were taking turns, I skipped mine.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/o

<p>Rytting Kaneryd keeps Chelsea on top, Parris punishes United while Arsenal move on with life after Eidevall</p><p>The issues that plagued Arsenal under Jonas Eidevall will not go away overnight, but two wins from two under interim manager Renée Slegers will do a lot for the confidence of the team. “It is what we wanted, we knew we had these two games ahead of us and we wanted to win them both and we have to be happy with it,” said Slegers. A 2-0 win at West Ham, a team that beat them in the corresponding fixture last season, will feel cathartic for Arsenal. It took until the 71st minute for them to break the deadlock and the goal came via a penalty. That opened the game up enough for the visiting team to grab a late second. The difficulties Arsenal have had breaking down low blocks remains, though. There are positives – the introduction of four substitutes around the hour mark made the difference, a sign that Slegers will not sit and wait for something to happen when things are not
