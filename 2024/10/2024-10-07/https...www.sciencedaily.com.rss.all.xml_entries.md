Planet-forming disks, maelstroms of gas and dust swirling around young stars, are nurseries that give rise to planetary systems, including our solar system. Astronomers have discovered new details of gas flows that sculpt those disks and shape them over time.

Scientists have discovered the secret to regulating our internal clock. They identified that this regulator sits right at the tail end of Casein Kinase 1 delta, a protein which acts as a pace setter for our internal biological clock or the natural 24-hour cycles that control sleep-wake patterns and other daily functions, known as circadian rhythm.

## How cells maintain their central processing unit for cell division

A centromere is a specialized location in the DNA that functions as the control center of cell division and is maintained, unchanged, across generations of cells. It is characterized by a special protein, called centromeric protein A (CENP-A), which marks the centromere and mobilizes other players necessary for cell division.

## Low stream diatom biodiversity potentially decreasing stream oxygen production in remote islands

## Gut hormones could hold the key to fighting fatty liver disease

Fatty liver disease is a growing global health concern. Proglucagon-derived peptides (PGDPs), including glucagon, GLP-1, and GLP-2, are known to regulate lipid metabolism in the liver. However, the mechanism underlying this remains unelucidated. Now, researchers have investigated the role of PGDPs, including glucagon, GLP-1, and GLP-2, in fat accumulation in the liver using GCGKO mice deficient in these peptides.

## A compost in the sea that produces oxygen

Researchers studied the fate of the material produced by Posidonia seagrass meadows. This study, carried out in the Mediterranean Sea at STARESO, shows that the dead leaves of what is commonly known as Neptune grass accumulate in shallow areas, where they break down like a compost, remineralizing the organic matter. This has a previously underestimated effect on carbon fluxes in the Mediterranean coastal environments. Surprisingly, alongside this CO2 emission, oxygen production was also measured. This is linked to the presence of photosynthetic organisms living in this compost in the sea, which fundamentally differentiates it from compost on land.

## Space oddity: Most distant rotating disc galaxy found

Researchers have discovered the most distant Milky-Way-like galaxy yet observed. Dubbed REBELS-25, this disc galaxy seems as orderly as present-day galaxies, but we see it as it was when the Universe was only 700 million years old. This is surprising since, according to our current understanding of galaxy formation, such early galaxies are expected to appear more chaotic.

Doctors have long believed the cancer drug 5-fluorouracil works by damaging the building blocks of DNA, but researchers have now found that in certain cancers, it kills cells by interfering with RNA synthesis. The findings could help researchers design better drug combinations for colon and gastrointestinal cancers.

## Protecting confidentiality in adolescent patient portals

Researchers found that the possibility of parental disclosure through online patient portals led older adolescents to hesitate in sharing complete health information with doctors, putting them at risk of missed diagnoses and treatments. The paper noted that confidentiality concerns were increased among females and those who are sexual and gender minorities.
