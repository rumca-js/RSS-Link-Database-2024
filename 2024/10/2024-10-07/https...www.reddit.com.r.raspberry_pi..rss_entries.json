As a long-time Raspberry Pi user I\u2019ve always been a bit disappointed by the limited options for cases on the market\u2026 so I decided to design and 3D print my own but I\u2019m still looking for ways to improve it.</p> <p>I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts or suggestions on the design. What would you add or change? I\u2019m also curious about features that other Pi enthusiasts look for in a case.</p> <p>I\u2019m thinking about sharing the design files if there\u2019s enough interest. P.S: I only made the section model to show how it looks on the inside.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/icelandnode\"> /u/icelandnode </a> <br/> <span><a hre", "id": 1280276, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1fy6l2g/i_made_a_raspberry_case", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 470, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/jYlZNWXjKXBiPwdNlOmsLsQmziS2iDpKfL2j8gqek3I.jpg", "title": "I made a Raspberry case", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-10-07T08:31:04+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>We have just published <a href=\"https://github.com/andrewdavidmackenzie/pigg/releases/tag/0.4.0\">release 0.4.0</a> of <a href=\"https://github.com/andrewdavidmackenzie/pigg\">pigg</a>, your &quot;No-Code&quot; way to control Raspberry Pi GPIO hardware via GUI locally (on a Pi) or remotely (on macos, linux or windows).</p> <pre><code>Install it (on your macos/linux/windows &quot;host&quot; and/or your Raspberry Pi) with: - `cargo install pigg` if you have a working rust toolchain - `cargo binstall pigg` to install pre-build binaries for your platform (you need cargo and cargo-binstall installed) - To install pre-build binaries via shell script: `curl --proto &#39;=https&#39; --tlsv1.2 -LsSf | sh` - To install pre-build binaries via brew `brew install andrewdavidmackenzie/pigg-tap/pigg` This release has been a long time coming due to Summer vacations, being busy in general, struggling to get GH Action for our release to build for armv7 and aarch64 working", "id": 1278579, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1fy2u57/raspberry_pi_gpio_control_gui_pigg_040_released", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 470, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Raspberry Pi GPIO control GUI \"pigg\" 0.4.0 released", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-10-07T08:12:42+00:00", "description": "&#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/DarthLordi\"> /u/DarthLordi </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/sd-cards-and-bumper/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1fy2lu5/new_products_raspberry_pi_sd_cards_and_the/\">[comments]</a></span>", "id": 1278580, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1fy2lu5/new_products_raspberry_pi_sd_cards_and_the", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 470, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "New Products - Raspberry Pi SD Cards and the Raspberry Pi Bumper: your new favourite accessories", "vote": 0}]
