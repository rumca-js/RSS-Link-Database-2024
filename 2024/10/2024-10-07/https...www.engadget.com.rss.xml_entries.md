<p>Amazon Prime Big Deal Days is back this year, returning on <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/deals/amazon-announces-the-return-of-prime-big-deal-days-on-october-8-and-9-050356758.html">October 8 and 9</a>. The “fall <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-prime-day/">Prime Day</a>” of sorts has served as the online retailer’s unofficial kickoff to the holiday shopping season for the past few years. We expect most of the deals to be Prime exclusives, meaning you must be an active Prime subscriber to get the discounts. There are always a couple of deals available for everyone, though, so it’s worth perusing Amazon’s site even if you don’t pay for Prime. It’s also worth doing so now because we’ve found a number of solid early Prime Day deals already available. These are the best of the bunch; we’ll be updating this post regularly in the lead-up to October Prime Day, so check back for the latest deals.</p>

It’s actually a port of the deluxe edition of the game, which was originally released in 2023. This version includes all of the available DLC and some other goodies.</p>
<p>It’s coming to iOS and Android and offers “full support for all popular gamepads”, with touch and tilt controls for those who don’t have a third-party gamepad. There’s a trailer, with footage captured on mobile devices, and it looks pretty darn good. The visuals are, dare I say, console-worthy.</p>

<p>At yesterday&#39;s Halo World Championships, developer 343 Industries <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/news/a-new-dawn">announced</a> that it was officially changing its name to Halo Studios. The company also revealed that it has multiple new games in the pipeline and is switching all future Halo development from its proprietary Slipspace Engine to <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/unreal-engine-5-available-release-date-151023130.html">Unreal Engine 5</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a YouTube video (below) the new studio showed elements from the &quot;Project Foundry&quot; Unreal Engine research effort that has been ongoing for the past several years. While just a tech demo for now, it showed Master Chief and Covenant elite designs, along with three biomes including a Cascades-type location, Flood-impacted Blightlands and snowy Coldlands.&nbsp;</p>

## Phoenix Springs review: A dazzling and disquieting sci-fi mystery

<p>Playing <em>Phoenix Springs</em> feels like being trapped in a gorgeous dream that’s steadily becoming a nightmare. It’s a point-and-click mystery set in a bleak futuristic world of dramatic shadows and muted primary colors, its scenes connected by streams of anxious static. The game stars Iris Dormer, a technology reporter who’s searching for her estranged brother, Leo. Her hunt takes her from the abandoned buildings of a rundown city, to a rich suburb, and finally to Phoenix Springs, a desert oasis bathed in golden light and occupied by a handful of odd, disconnected people.</p> 
<p>Iris is the heart of <em>Phoenix Springs</em>. She narrates the on-screen action in a stoic, unaffected tone that belies the cutting poetry of her observations. Iris has just three options when interacting with people and items: talk to, look at or use. Relevant concepts and objects are collected in her mental inventory, a simple word cloud of black text on a white background. Open the inventory with

<p>It&#39;s been a wait. Apple Intelligence will start <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/the-first-apple-intelligence-features-are-expected-to-arrive-on-october-28-144459627.html">rolling out</a> on October 28, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>’s Mark Gurman. Apple said last month it was targeting October for iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and macOS Sequoia 15.1 — which will bring some of the first Apple Intelligence features to iPhone 16 and the rest of the Apple family.</p>
<p>The first wave of Apple Intelligence-powered features will include its summarization tool, Writing Tools and smart audio recording and transcriptions for Mail, Notes, Pages and other apps. I’ve been testing the beta, and so far, the most useful feature has been the summarization tool, tackling my forest of notifications and messages and parsing them into glanceable summaries.</p>
