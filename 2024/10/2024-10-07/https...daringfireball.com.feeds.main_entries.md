<blockquote>
  <p>For months or longer, the hackers might have held access to
network infrastructure used to cooperate with lawful U.S. requests
for communications data, according to people familiar with the
matter, which amounts to a major national security risk. The
attackers also had access to other tranches of more generic
internet traffic, they said. Verizon Communications, AT&amp;T and
Lumen Technologies are among the companies whose networks were
breached by the recently discovered intrusion, the people said.</p>

<p>The widespread compromise is considered a potentially catastrophic
security breach and was carried out by a sophisticated Chinese
hacking group dubbed Salt Typhoon. It appeared to be geared toward
intelligence collection, the people said. [...]</p>

<p>The surveillance systems believed to be at issue are used to
cooperate with requests for domestic info

  <p>Today is the 30th anniversary of this blog. <em>Hola!</em></p>

<p>I did a <a href="http://scripting.com/2019/08/06/155950.html">roundup of thoughts</a> when this blog turned 25. I
stand by what I wrote then, but I’d add this. My blog started
because I needed content to test a script I had written that sent
emails on my Mac using <a href="http://scripting.com/frontier/apps/Eudora.html">Eudora</a>, which was an early
<a href="http://scripting.com/frontier/apps/Eudora.html">scriptable app</a> and I had a nice scripting system that
worked with it. I looked around for <a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/1994/10/07/marccantersingsagain.html">something</a> to send (30
years ago today), and shot out an email to the people whose
business cards I had collected at various tech conferences. It
was a thrill, so I did it <a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/1994/10/12/marcs10things.html">again</a>, and <a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/1994/10/13/lette

<p>Aaron Vegh and <a href="https://mastodon.social/@BenRiceM/113232525012383457">Ben Rice McCarthy</a> (of <a href="https://obscura.camera/obscura/index.html">Obscura</a> renown) have teamed up to create <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/croissant-cross-posting/id6670288979">Croissant</a>, a new app — currently iPhone-only — for cross-posting to Mastodon, Threads, and Bluesky. 15 years ago I wrote “Twitter Clients Are a UI Design Playground” and that piece stands up, but it’s not Twitter/X in particular (certainly not anymore — X support is conspicuously omitted from Croissant’s current lineup up supported platforms), but tweet-like platforms in general. Croissant proves that this domain remains a UI playground. It’s both visually distinctive and intuitively familiar, with a fun and fluid UI. It’s the sort of app that I want to find reasons to use.</p>
