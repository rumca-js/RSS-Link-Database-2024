<p><strong>Hayward Gallery, London</strong> <br>This busy retrospective of the Korean artist’s collage-heavy work uses terms like ‘displacement’ and ‘interconnectivity’ but you’d be better off just taking a walk to the shops</p><p>When Haegue Yang was in Germany a few years ago, she became fascinated by a local hardware store, or more specifically its catalogue. She made a series of collages by cutting it up, including one in which rolls of brown packing paper are arranged in a star-like symmetrical pattern. And that’s it. The Hayward’s retrospective of this 53-year-old South Korean is full of stuff like this. It is immense, crowded and completely unrewarding. None of it adds up and none of it is moving – unless you are the kind of person who tears up over a venetian blind. “Venetian blinds are a prominent feature,” says a wall text, explaining Yang’s work. “She is particularly drawn to their tilted slats.”</p><p>In one installation, these tilted slats cover the sides of illuminated b

Even with added devastation, this is TV at its most beautiful, furious and hilarious</p><p>Last time we encountered Alma Nuttall – the conscientiously “fabulous” protagonist of Alma’s Not Normal – she was about to swap her frequently grim job as an escort for a six-month tour with an inclusive theatre company, having qualified for a place on account of her experiences in the care system. She’d been nailbitingly close to passing up the opportunity altogether: guilt-tripped by her self-pitying heroin addict mother and almost charmed back into submission by her arse of an ex-boyfriend, Alma was on the verge of staying put in her Bolton flat, complete with Julie Walters shrine and felt-tip-rendered plan for Hollywood domination. That didn’t happen, thankfully. Due to a combination of her traumatic upbringing and whimsical nature, there are few characters easier to root for than this sweetly garrul

Delyth is not glib about it, but her view is both loose and lively, silly and serious, offering an image of urbanisation and poverty that is hard to read.

But what about the fact you’re here at all?</p><p>At around midday on 19 August 1949, wreathed in thick mist, a British European Airways DC-3 going from Belfast to Manchester flew into a hillside on Saddleworth Moor in the Peak District, near Oldham. All the crew and 21 of the 29 passengers died on impact or soon afterwards. Eight passengers survived, including a young boy and his parents, although, devastatingly, their younger child was one of the fatalities. That surviving boy became my friend and statistical colleague, Prof Stephen Evans.</p><p>I think we would agree that Stephen was lucky. But what do we mean by “luck”? We might say that someone has been lucky, or unlucky, if they have benefited or been harmed by something that was unpredictable and beyond their control.

I’d call this unusual, except it is a lot less unusual than it used to be. Anti-Jewish hate crime skyrocketed after the Hamas attack on Israel last year and still hasn’t returned to what we used to consider “normal”. There have been almost as many antisemitic incidents in the year since 7 October 2023 as there were in the whole of 2020, 2021 and 2022

<p>Jordan Nobbs gives Aston Villa’s coach Modric vibes, Crystal Palace have liftoff but attacking statistics damn Arsenal</p><p>The Aston Villa midfielder Jordan Nobbs became the Women’s Super League’s all-time leading appearance maker when she played in her 193rd WSL match, an entertaining 4-2 loss at Brighton. The Villa manager, Robert de Pauw, said: “The energy and the experience she brings on the pitch, I know she’s one of the older players on the team, but good enough is old enough, like a little [Luka] Modric in midfield. If I compare it to one player it would be him. I have all the respect in the world for what she’s doing and the level that she brings.” The 71-times capped England international is being deployed in a deeper, holding role by De Pauw, rather than as the No 10 she became known as earlier in her career, and De Pauw said of the 31-year-old former Arsenal player: “If you read the game well like Jordan, then you can play in both roles.” <strong>TG</strong></p> <a hre

<p>A hearty, carby comfort bowl with optional crumbled sausage</p><p>At a wedding recently, I sat near two old friends talking about 1998, the year they drove all over Italy in a white Fiat Ducato van. Farther down the table, someone was talking about removal men swinging a wardrobe through a fifth-floor window.

At a certain point, though, the van chat turned to beans and sausages, so I tuned in.</p><p>There was some back and forth about which city they were in – Novara in Piemonte, Mantova in Lombardia, or Treviso in Veneto – before the reminiscing concentrated on dinner.

Being so hungry as to be flexible, they agreed, only to find that when the dish arrived the sausages

This relentless, suffocating exhortation to be happier, to improve yourself, to get better – to build a better life.

Most potently of all, it likely comes from your own mind.</p><p>It might sound obvious, but I’m not sure it really is, so I will say it: there are times when life feels very difficult, painful and overwhelming. When things go wrong, when things go right but that feels even worse, when the washing machine leaks and jobs are lost and homes are lost and people are lost and and and … when it takes all your energy just to survive.

<p>Got a beauty dilemma? Our expert is here to offer advice. This week, Alex is after skincare tips</p><p>There is so much confusing information on social media about skincare, but it’s crucial to get advice from experts. When puberty starts, hormone levels shift and the skin sometimes becomes oilier and more acne-prone. “The oil can mix with dead skin cells and bacteria which can clog pores, leading to pimples, blackheads, inflammation and acne,” says dermatologist Dr Anna Protasova at <a href="https://evoclinic.ae/">Evolution Aesthetics Clinic</a>.</p><p>The ideal is to balance your skin’s oil production, so using a gentle cleanser, a lightweight moisturiser and sunscreen of SPF30 or above is key. “Choose a cleanser that is mild and right for your skin type. Use it morning, evening and after strenuous exercise,” Protasova adds. Applying acne products with benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid can be helpful. Follow this with a light moisturiser with SPF.</p> <a href="https://www.thegua

<p>Having launched three labels and remixed the likes of Dua Lipa and the Chemical Brothers, the musician is now exploring a dark time – and his own queer reckoning</p><p>Harry Agius had been DJing in clubs for almost a decade, but in 2019 something switched. After a summer spent at NYC Downlow, the LGBTQ+ dance space at Glastonbury, and Honcho Campout, a queer festival in Pennsylvania, the DJ-producer better known as Midland finally felt as if he had tapped into his “authentic self”. Tracing his formative years at drum’n’bass and dubstep nights, he tells me: “For a long while, I would feel like the only gay person in those spaces. I came out of the summer of 2019 feeling like: I can’t really go back.”</p><p>Then came the pandemic. With all live shows pulled and time on his hands, Agius began to reflect on that transformative year and the “dual void” he had been living in beforehand, something he had managed to ignore by being so busy (at one point, he was playing more than 100 gigs a

<p>Ederson is showing his worth to Manchester City and Everton’s Jordan Pickford silences the boo-boys</p><p>After Ederson made several vital saves to deny Fulham – and particularly Adama Traoré – Pep Guardiola revealed that summer interest from Saudi clubs for the Manchester City No 1 was never firmed up. “He knew from day one I didn’t want it, we didn’t want it,” said the City manager. “But the offer didn’t come – the real offer. Because they [Al-Nassr] made an offer, but for the keeper, for the team who won four Premier Leagues in a row, he has a value, a price. Otherwise, he cannot leave.” Guardiola praised the Brazilian for regaining his focus after the uncertainty. “Ederson is so strong: in one second, he says: ‘OK, I’m here, I’m going to do my best.’” Guardiola also believes the presence of Stefan Ortega has pushed his first-choice keeper. “Sometimes Ederson has to have the feeling that he has to perform well, otherwise Stefan can play.
