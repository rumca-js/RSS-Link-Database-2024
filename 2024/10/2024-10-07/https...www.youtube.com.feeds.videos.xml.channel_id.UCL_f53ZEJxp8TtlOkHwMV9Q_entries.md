Dr. Jordan B. Peterson sits down with the 13th Prime Minister of Israel, Naftali Bennett. They discuss the internal divisions of Israel, how October 7th refocused the nation, the means by which the Islamic Republic of Iran operates its industry of terror, the victim/victimizer narrative, and what victory might actually look like.

Naftali Bennett is an Israeli politician who entered politics in 2006 as the Chief of Staff for Benjamin Netanyahu. From 2018 to 2022 he served as the leader of the New Right party. Then from June 2021 to June 2022, he served as the 13th prime minister of Israel. He retired after one term, becoming the 3rd alternate Prime Minister. He then resigned from this position and re-entered the private sphere as a board member of the Israeli tech company Quantum Source.
