<p>Extra storage space is always awesome, especially when we’re talking about a tiny portable SSD at a great price.</p>



<p>Right now, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SK-hynix-Windowsbased-Androidbased-Smartphones/dp/B0C4KNB2YK/">SK Hynix Beetle X31 is on sale for $85 on Amazon</a>, which is a solid 37% discount off its $135 MSRP and not far off from its best-ever historical price. We love it at this price.</p>



<p>Despite its compact size, the SK Hynix Beetle X31 is actually a 1TB SSD that can reach up to 1,050MB/s speeds, which means it’s going to take you very little time to transfer even huge files. It’s also sleek and stylish, though the golden finish may not be to everyone’s tastes.</p>

<p>The Linux-based SteamOS and its <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394895/what-is-valve-proton-steam-deck-games-software-explained.html">Proton compatibility layer</a> is the “special sauce” that makes the Steam Deck the best gaming handheld around, even after a few years of competition against newer hardware.</p>



<p>But what if you could get Windows off of those competing devices and get SteamOS loaded up on them instead? You can! Sort of. With an <a href="https://bazzite.gg">open-source tool called Bazzite</a>. Adam and Will walk us through it in the latest PCWorld video on YouTube.</p>



<p>Getting Bazzite loaded up on the Asus ROG Ally, Lenovo Legion Go, or any number of similar devices isn’t exactly painless, but it should be doable for anyone who knows how to re-install Windows. You’ll need a USB drive for loading up the bootable OS image a

<p>Portable monitors are gaining popularity among both desktop PC and laptop users, and it’s easy to see why. While portable monitors might not reach the large screen sizes of conventional displays, they offer other advantages: They are relatively inexpensive, easy to connect, and, best of all, easy to transport — whether that’s to a different city for work, or to a different room in your house. </p>



<p>But consumers should know that the widespread availability of these displays and the ability to manufacture them cheaply has resulted in a spate of questionable brands on the market. Often the quality of these monitors can be sub-par. That’s where we at PCWorld come in. We’ve tested multiple models and can separate the best portable monitors from the rest. </p>



<p>Our list of favorites below will help you find the right portable monitor for you. You can

<p>A “Hackintosh” is a standard PC that’s modified to run Apple’s proprietary macOS (or OS X) operating system. It was a popular pastime back when Apple was using Intel chips in its laptops and desktops, though it’s fallen off now that Apple is on self-built Arm hardware.</p>



<p>But someone is keeping the spirit of Hackintosh alive by running the latest macOS Sequoia build on a Steam Deck.</p>



<p>Why would you work really long and really hard to boot an operating system that’s very pointedly <em>not</em> designed for gaming, on a device that’s designed pretty much exclusively to play games? Phooey. (Hackintosh people care not for your paltry concerns of “logic” and “common sense.” They do it for the love of… something, I assume. I don’t get it either.)</p>

These are recently opened documents, launched programs, and frequently used folders. We’ll show you how to remove this data. It’s actually pretty easy to do.</p>

<p>I hate to say it, but desktop PCs are behind the times.</p>



<p>This may seem a little strange, but I haven’t used a desktop PC for years (decades?) until recently. Laptops, even an odd Chromebook or two, generally took care of my needs. In the evening, I’d fire up the Xbox or use a gaming laptop. It’s only recently that I’ve jumped back into desktop PC gaming, and my desktop — all desktops, really — lack one important feature:</p>



<p>A Thunderbolt port. Or, a USB4 port, if you prefer.</p>



<p>Thunderbolt or a high-speed USB4 port are now staples on laptops, even some gaming laptops. Most gaming laptops still include a dedicated DisplayPort or HDMI port, primarily because gamers prefer a directly connected, high-speed interface to a high-refresh-rate display. And that’s fine; I get that. Until now, Thunderbolt hasn’t delivered.</p>

<p>What we see and use on the internet in web browsers such as Edge, Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and Safari is only a fraction of what is actually available. Information and data can be published and exchanged with the greatest possible anonymity on the so-called darknet, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/447091/meet-darknet-the-hidden-anonymous-underbelly-of-the-searchable-web.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.pcworld.com/article/447091/meet-darknet-the-hidden-anonymous-underbelly-of-the-searchable-web.html">as PCWorld first noted in 2013</a>.</p>
