<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have a use case in my business where I have a large list of products (500-1000), potentially more. I need to get the product URL from known retailers (Amazon, Walmart, etc).. I&#39;ve tried various AI tools however there is always a limitation. Some can&#39;t access the internet, others have aggressive throttles on requests like this.</p> <p>I assume something like this has to exist already so I figured I&#39;d ask before I start trying to implement a solution myself. I&#39;m willing to pay for the service so it doesn&#39;t have to be free. Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Jumpy-Mess2492"> /u/Jumpy-Mess2492 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1fyhpes/tool_i_can_provide_a_product_name_and_it_returns/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1fyhpes/tool_i_can_provide_a_product_name_and_it_returns/">[comments]<

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Wondering if its worth it to block webrtc or figure out a way to spoof it to my proxy ip. Anyone know if mainstream socials check for it at all?
