<p>Based on a real murder in Chile in the 1950s, Maite Alberdi’s fictional story of obsession has glamour and style, but no intensity</p><p>Chile’s Oscar entry this year is this quirky, unsatisfying oddity from director Maite Alberdi, co-produced by Pablo Larraín, and inspired by a stranger-than-fiction true-crime case from the 1950s. It is elegant and amusing enough at first, with some rackety humour that Alfred Hitchcock might have enjoyed. But it never really lands the punch it seems to promise; the intense psychological drama of single-white-female-meets-Ripley never materialises. A documentary might have served this material better, or a fiction feature that doesn’t have a made-up character as the lead.</p><p>In Chile in 1955, the entire nation was gripped by the arrest of bestselling author María Carolina Geel, who had brazenly shot her lover dead in the dining room of the plush Hotel Crillón in Santiago, apparently because he was in love with another woman.

But less than 10 minutes in he’s already dished out a handful of loosely interconnected mantras for modern life: “The metric of whether it’s a good bar is if you feel like it’s someone’s house”; “There’s no saying sorry in America – they think you’re taking the piss”; “The best thing about London is that everyone’s really nice – in America, everyone’s looking for a chance to get ahead”.

<p>The Bengals QB has 12 touchdowns and just two interceptions this season. Yet his team find themselves scraping the barrel</p><p>It’s official: Joe Burrow of the Cincinnati Bengals is one of the unluckiest quarterbacks we’ve ever seen. The Bengals <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/boxscore/_/gameId/401671626">lost 41-38 to the Baltimore Ravens</a> in overtime on Sunday, sending Cincinnati to 1-4 on the season. It certainly hasn’t been Burrow’s fault – through the first five games of the season, Burrow has completed 125 of 173 passes (a 72.3% completion rate) for 1,370 yards (7.9 yards per attempt), 12 touchdowns, two interceptions, and an outstanding passer rating of 113.6 (his QBR of 73.6 is <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/qbr">the second-best in the league</a>).</p><p>But that hasn’t been enough to stop the Bengals slipping out of the playoff race – “We’re not a championship-level team right now,” was Burrow’s brutal conclusion after Sunday’s loss.

<p>At least two people were killed and several more injured after an explosion near Karachi airport in Pakistan on Sunday night. A local official said initial reports suggested a tanker exploded outside the airport while authorities were working to determine if the explosion was part of an attack. In a statement emailed to journalists the separatist militant group Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), claimed the explosion was an attack carried out by them using an improvised explosive device. The group said they deliberately targeted 'a high-level convoy of Chinese engineers and investors' coming from Karachi’s airport. The Chinese embassy in Pakistan condemned the attack and called for a thorough investigation.</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/06/people-killed-and-injured-in-explosion-near-karachi-airport">Two killed in explosion near Karachi airport targeting Chinese nationals</a></p></li></ul> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2024/oct/07/po
