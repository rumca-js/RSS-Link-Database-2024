Thus, attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in them. While compartmentalizing vulnerable drivers can enhance security, existing methods are limited, preventing them from being widely deployed: rebooting the system is necessary which inevitably interrupts services. Syzkaller\u2019s data indicates that avg. 7.62 unique kernel panics are reported per day. It means the machine would need multiple reboots in one day to enforce compartmentalization, which is unacceptable. In this talk, we will explore the potential of on-the-fly enforcement, the main challenge of which lies in handling transition hazards - pre-existing objects are untracked and can be misused.

Moreover, CC includes one crucial feature: remote attestation is used to get a proof of the TEE and the runtime environment authenticity and integrity before any secrets get provisioned. To ease confidential computing adoption, a smooth transition is critical. While confidential virtual machines allow users to easily move their existing workloads to run in TEEs making them attestation aware may still be disruptive. Ideally, no changes should be needed even when attestation gets involved. Linux Keyring offers an interesting choice to solve the challenge.
