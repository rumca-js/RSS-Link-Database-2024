Definetly more horror/slow paced gameplay than action.</p> <p>The story takes place in Area 51 where scientists researched for futuristic stuff, but they discovered something dangerous (like always) and it infected the whole zivilisation living there. You, as some kind of special agent forcement, and your mates are send to this place to check what&#39;s going on there and recover precious data about this incident. The story is ok. Somewhat basic I think and the was a bit weird written at some points for my taste, but all in all it&#39;s ok.</p> <p>The strong part of this game is the gameplay. You have got 2 guns and a special suit with ice abilities to kill your enemies in different ways.</p> <p>The game is very polished (especially compared to its predecessor). The visuals (on PS5) were very quite good and the soundtracks were good too.</p> <p>And the game has a many little references to other horror gam

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This month I really wanna max out on spooky stuff, so what do you guys recommend? I beat Faith the Unholy Trinity, RE4, Bioshock, and I got Silent Hill 2. Any other good game recommendations to fill this endless appetite? (Pumpkin Jack also is really good not horror but good to fit that vibe)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Crytaz"> /u/Crytaz </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1fy2ljs/what_games_are_you_playing_for_that_halloween_mood/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1fy2ljs/what_games_are_you_playing_for_that_halloween_mood/">[comments]</a></span>

## How do people play a game they don't like for hundreds of hours?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve seen so many reviews of massive, open world games (more recently, Starfield, Diablo 4, assassin&#39;s creed) from people on here whereby they&#39;ll state that they played the game for &quot;200 or 300 hours&quot; and &quot;hated it&quot;. Some will say that they didn&#39;t like it from the beginning. Why keep playing then? What did you expect to see at hour 150 that you didn&#39;t see at 50? It&#39;s amazing to me that people even have that kind of time, but still. Some will complain that there isn&#39;t enough content. How much do you need? Isn&#39;t it unfair to expect a AAA quality game with massive production values that also gives more than 300 hours worth of content? But I guess that&#39;s a separate question.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SaveADay89"> /u/SaveADay89 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1fxw7sf/how_do_people_play_a_game_they_dont_like
