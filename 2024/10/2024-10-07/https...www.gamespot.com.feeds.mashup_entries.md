<p>The best thing about an anime or a manga series reaching its end is that you can dive into it and <em>not </em>have to worry about cliffhangers. Attack on Titan is a fine example of this, and for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/amazon-prime-day-deals/">Prime Big Deal Days</a>, you can pick up the entire saga in print form at its best price yet. If you've never read it, Attack on Titan has long been hailed as one of the best stories told in print and on TV. A harrowing tale of survival in a world filled with almost-unkillable man-eating giants, the series has steampunk action and gruesome devastation, and it touches on heavy themes like genocide.</p><p>What's nice about these Attack on Titan omnibus editions is that you're getting the maximum bang for your buck when it comes to reading material. You're getting three regular manga volumes in one chunky edition--except for the final omnibus in this series--and on average these are almost 600 pages in size. That gives you a chunk of

Since the site was founded in 1996, only 27 games have earned that rank. But to achieve a 10/10, a game needs to be essential, and it needs to have something so meaningful to offer us that it simply cannot be ignored. Regardless, a 10/10 review score is always determined by the personal opinion of its respective writer and always reflects as such. So without further ado, here is a list of all the games that we've scored with a 10/10!

<p>When I was younger, I was told that there were two things a person should avoid discussing in polite conversation: religion and politics. Such topics were divisive, I was informed. Contentious. Even then, this policy bewildered me. Politics and religion are the lenses through which we view the world--our most powerful institutions--and we are expected to avoid talking about them? Impossible, I thought. Yet as I've grown older, I've encountered many who abide by this rule, and even more who pretend that they can't feel the flames even when the entire world is on fire. It's isolating, then, to feel consumed by the blaze. Lately it feels as if I'm made up of blistering anger, disappointment, and anxiety that borders on despair. I've struggled to find a balm for this ailment. And this makes it all the more surprising that I've found some relief in the form of a fantasy RPG.</p><p dir="ltr">Metaphor: ReFantazio is acutely aware of the role religion and politics play in society, and is m
