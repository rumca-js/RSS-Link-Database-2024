<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I see on the FlashFloppy wiki that the Goteks with the Artery AT32F435 microcontroller are recommended. Mine has the AT32F415 but it seems to work fine. I am only reading images to play games, I&#39;m not formatting or writing data to the drive. Is there a compelling reason to get an AT32F435? Also what is the purpose of the eject switch? Moving the rotary appears to select an new image and &quot;mount&quot; it. When would you need to use &quot;eject&quot;?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/deanodley"> /u/deanodley </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1fyc2i4/gotek_models/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1fyc2i4/gotek_models/">[comments]</a></span>
