<p>It’s been three years since Microsoft released the 2021 version of its inescapable Office apps suite, but the company hasn’t been resting on its laurels. The subscription-based, always-online Microsoft 365 has been getting constant tweaks and updates in that time.</p>



<p>But not everyone is keen on software-as-a-service. If you’d rather pay a flat fee for software, here’s some good news for you: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2024/09/30/office-2024-for-consumers-available-october-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft recently released Office 2024 for consumers</a>.</p>

<p>Troubled by pesky Wi-Fi dead zones in your home? You’re not alone. Fortunately, there’s a budget-friendly solution that can improve your home Wi-Fi signal strength with almost no hassle.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wifi-Extender-Booster-Wireless-Repeater/dp/B08RHD97QY/">TP-Link AC1200 Wi-Fi Extender is on sale for $23 at Amazon</a>, which is a massive 54 percent discount off its usual $50 MSRP.</p>



<p>As a Wi-Fi extender, the TP-Link AC1200 takes your Wi-Fi router connection and re-broadcasts it, effectively boosting the signal for better reception in areas that don’t get a good signal from the router itself. If you have unstable or spotty Wi-Fi connection, this could be the reason why.</p>



<p>Since it works with just about any modern router, you can get this one without much of a second thought. Once you get it set up, it’ll extend

<p>According to some Microsoft Word users, the Office software is apparently deleting files after saving — not the kind of behavior you want when doing important work, and not the kind of bug you’d expect from a company as established as Microsoft.</p>



<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/locally-saved-word-files-with-capitalized-file-extensions-or-in-the-title-may-be-deleted-after-save-5e28f8c2-32d0-487b-b237-9c7c74d25f84">Microsoft has officially confirmed the issue</a> as of October 3, 2024. But while we haven’t gotten a definitive explanation or solution yet, there <em>is</em> a temporary workaround. If you can’t avoid using Microsoft Word until an official fix is released, read on for what you should do.</p>
