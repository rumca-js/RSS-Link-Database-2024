One of us got the series two set so we decided to play a bunch of them while spending a Sunday day drinking. One of the members of the group had an absolute gut wrenching experience basically only making it a couple of turns before getting killed by the xenomorph. We had a quick laugh at the shortest horror movie of all time. One of the other members brought up how the game feels hard and challenging (in a good way). That topic led us to discuss the proliferation of hard games in the past couple years, not just in board games but in video games as well. With the likes of Dark Souls and other \u201csouls-like\u201d games kind of being a big part of the market it got us asking are those types of games even fun? Is there diminishing returns on the sense of accomplishment for beating hard games?

I played this game about flying planes when I was a kid about 20 years ago. In the game, you have a huge world map with a ton of cities all interconnected with lines. Everyone starts on one end of the world and has to fly to the other. I think you pick a card that&#39;s face down, it tells you a city without the country, and then you have to find that city within a duration of time or else you can&#39;t fly there. I might be misremembering the game&#39;s rules slightly. If anyone has any idea what this game is, please let me know! Been driving me nuts for weeks.
