Bacteria come in a surprising variety of shapes. In addition to rod-shaped representatives such as the widely known model bacterium E. coli, there are numerous curved and even spiral-shaped bacteria. Curvature is crucial to the ability of bacteria to colonize surfaces and move in viscous environments—and thus also to cause disease, as is the case for Vibrio cholerae or Helicobacter pylori. Researchers worldwide are working to understand the molecular details of bacterial cell curvature, with the hope of someday being able to influence it and thus potentially combat pathogens.
