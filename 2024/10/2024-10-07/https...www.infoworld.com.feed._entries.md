<p>Until recently, data scientists and analysts’ primary deliverables were data visualizations, machine learning models, dashboards, reports, and analytical insights used for storytelling. Now, with genAI capabilities, data scientists are called to expand their analytics to include unstructured data sources, help business teams pivot to <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3715665/7-steps-to-improve-analytics-for-data-driven-organizations.html">data-driven decision-making</a>, consult on AI ethics and governance, and help establish guardrails for the growing ranks of citizen data scientists.</p>

<p>“You don’t want AI only in the hands of a few companies.” Thus <a href="https://x.com/fdaudens/status/1841302236808298752">spake Hugging Face CEO Clem Delangue</a>, suggesting that <a href="http://chatgpt-o1-preview-excels-at-code-generation">open source</a> will come to the rescue of AI. It’s a nice thought, but one that has exactly zero historical precedent. Yes, open source has become integral to building software, but name a market where open source has prevented that market from settling into “the hands of a few companies.” Go ahead. I’ll wait.</p>

<p>Time series forecasting is a powerful <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3214424/what-is-machine-learning-intelligence-derived-from-data.html">machine learning</a> method that leverages historical time-stamped data to predict future events and help reduce uncertainty from business conditions — for example, to accurately predict sales, inventory levels, and even manufacturing data.</p>



<p>Much of the data your company has is already time-stamped. It’s probably sitting in Excel spreadsheets, brimming with potential. Here are five ways you could use that data for time series forecasting.</p>

<p>“Ho, hum,” I thought in response to the release of the <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-openai-o1-preview/">OpenAI o1 models</a>. “Yet another stochastic parrot.” I was wrong. In fact, I tried the o1-preview model on one of my standard programming tasks, and found it to be surprisingly good.</p>



<p>The recently released ChatGPT o1-preview model is an early version of the much-rumored “Strawberry” model. I tested it out by asking it to implement a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort">QuickSort algorithm</a> as a C++ function with integer inputs, a task that has stymied many earlier models, and to write a test suite for the function. Its first response was entirely cor
