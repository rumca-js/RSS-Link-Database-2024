  <p id="wu3y70"><em>Persona</em> is one of the rare video game series where people actually talk about the menus. They’re functional, sure, but they’re also so incredibly stylish that you almost don’t mind constantly pausing to equip gear or heal your party. So when I had the chance to talk to longtime<em> Persona</em> director Katsura Hashino about his new game, <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em>, which continues this tradition of beautiful menus, I had to ask how they do it.</p>
<p id="NTNXKZ">The answer, as Hashino explains it, is simply a lot of work:</p>
<blockquote><p id="HzuN42">In general, the way most game developers make UI is very simple. T

  <p id="4LYxvu">The iPhone 16 Pro’s camera upgrades may be the true highlights of this year’s phone. So, for the past three weeks, <em>The Verge</em> supervising producer Vjeran Pavic has been testing out everything the camera has to offer.</p>
<p id="hWir7l">Apple’s new Camera Control button may be the headline feature, but the iPhone 16 is also equipped with a suite of new photo adjustment tools that let you dial in individual aspects of how an image looks. Apple also beefed up the phone’s recording capabilities, which can capture 120fps 4K in slow motion while shooting in ProRes in Apple Log.  </p>

  <p class="p--has-dropcap" id="MtdHP5">In <em>Phoenix Springs</em>, it’s not so much the ravishing hand-drawn visuals that first grab the attention, but the voice of narrator and protagonist Iris. Befitting her name, she behaves like a roving eye, investigating and describing her surroundings with a clinical, almost robotic detachment. Yet Iris is no blank slate: you quickly come to learn that she is a snob with little regard for the homeless. She even appears to have short shrift for the player, delivering a withering putdown when you make a connection she deems just a little <em>too</em> obvious.</p>
