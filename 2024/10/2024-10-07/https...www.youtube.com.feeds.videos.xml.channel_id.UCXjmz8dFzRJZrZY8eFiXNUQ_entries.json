The few that we've gotten in the likes of X-Men Origins: Wolverine have been disappointing to say the least.   When Channing Tatum's solo outing as Gambit was shelved by Disney, it seemed like we'd never see Remy LeBeau properly adapted.  But when Deadpool & Wolverine debuted, fans were surprised to see Channing Tatum donning the iconic Gambit costume.  Will this be the last we see of Gambit in the MCU?  I don't think so, but only time will tell how the fan favorite X-Men will return. \n\n#gambit #channingtatum #xmen #deadpoolandwolverinemovie \n\nSources\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20171006112005/http://www.superherohype.com/features/95813-taylor-kitsch-is-gambit-in-wolverine\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20170511152635/http://www.slashfilm.com/channing-tatum-would-like-to-play-gambit-in-an-x-men-movie/\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20170701055034/http://collider.com/gambit-movie-heist-film-sexy-thriller", "id": 1281825, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DERywWQ32tM", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 236, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXjmz8dFzRJZrZY8eFiXNUQ", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/DERywWQ32tM/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "How Channing Tatum's Gambit Made A Name For Himself", "vote": 0}]
