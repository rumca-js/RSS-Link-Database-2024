<p>The European Court of Justice has decided that Facebook owner Meta must minimize the amount of personal data it uses for personalized ads, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gr4r5ln03o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the BBC reports</a> . The decision from the EU’s top court means that only a small part of Meta’s data collection can be used for advertisements.</p>



<p>The ruling stems from a complaint by privacy activist Max Schrems, who said Facebook used data about his sexual orientation for targeted ads — even though Schrems himself had not shared information about his sexual orientation on the platform.</p>



<p>Meta said it does not use so-called specially categorize

<p>The concept of data leakage — and all of its privacy, legal, compliance and cybersecurity implications — today has to be fundamentally re-envisioned, thanks to the biggest IT disruptor in decades: generativeAI (genAI).</p>



<p>Data leakage used to be straight-forward. Either an employee/contractor was sloppy (leaving a laptop in an unlocked car, forgetting highly-sensitive printouts on an airplane seat, accidentally sending internal financial projections to the wrong email recipient) or because an attacker stole data either while it was at rest or in transit. </p>



<p>Those worries now seem delightfully quaint. Enterprise environments are entirely amorphous, with data leakage just as easily

<p>Window management on Macs gets an upgrade with macOS Sequoia, which introduces window tiling and makes it much easier to work on tasks within multiple applications by arranging windows as you please. </p>



<p>Windows users moving to a Mac (and there’s an ever increasing number of those) will have come across this before. Window tiling is a great way to maximize the value of your available desktop space, even when working with multiple displays. </p>

<p>Dark Matter’s powerful fictional short film based on real events, Butterfly, goes inside the experience of a small business as its world is turned upside down by ransomware.</p>



<p>It’s an experience shared by a growing number of <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/cyber-security-breaches-survey-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">small businesses</a>  – half experienced some form of cybersecurity breach or attack in the last 12 months.</p>



<p>Yet not all want to tell their story, or even report they’ve been attacked. This helps propagate the myth that small businesses don’t need the same protection as larger firms.</p>

<p>Many people think of digital whiteboards as a simple adjunct to their videoconferencing software, an online space where remote and in-office participants — often software developers — can brainstorm, post ideas, and create simple diagrams on a whiteboard “canvas” using basic text and drawing tools. But with the current crop of dedicated tools, those are table stakes.</p>



<p>Today’s advanced, dedicated digital whiteboard software tools can serve much broader audiences and a wider range of use cases. “Think of these as visual collaboration tools. It’s definitely filling an unmet need,” says Chris Trueman, senior principal analyst at Gartner.</p>
