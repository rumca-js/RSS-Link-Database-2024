Undisputed fills the decade-old boxing game void quite well with its realistic graphics and impressive licensed fighter roster. Fans can create their own fighter to compete with others online and in the game’s Career Mode when Undisputed launches on October 11th . 

While the graphical polish and animation are impressive, Undisputed doesn’t pretend to supply a worthy replacement to Fight Night’s beloved story mode. There’s no cutscenes or voice acting to be had here, no, this is a text-based management game requiring careful balance of your fighter’s health, finances, and staff. 

The gameplay within the modes of Undisputed is realistic enough, featuring over 60 different punches and a level of polish regarding game performance. There’s a lot of strategy involved here, whether it be through fighter stats, balancing stamina, or anticipating an opponent’s knockout punch. There’s a lot to like with Undisputed, even if there’s some notable flaws here and there.

Remakes have been the rage for a few years, and Until Dawn is no exception. The interactive horror drama became a surprise success after launching in 2015 for the PS4, and while many craved a remaster or PS5 upgrade, Sony has answered with a remake. Helmed by Ballistic Moon, it's out now for PS5 and PC.

On top of rebuilding it from the ground up with Unreal Engine 5, the remake offers brand new animations, ray traced ambient occlusion and shadows, a new third-person camera, vastly overhauled models with much more details, and more. Fans can even look forward to an updated injury system and altered cinematography for some scenes.

Of course, the big question is how it measures up to the original. Is it a faithful remake, or does it take liberties with what worked nearly a decade ago? Join us as we compare the original and remake.

When you think about Dragon Ball, several things come to mind. The Dragon Ball Super anime, the recent manga arcs, maybe even video games like Dragon Ball FighterZ and Kakarot. However, for many gaming fans, the franchise peaked with Dragon Ball: Budokai Tenkaichi 3, a 3D arena fighter with a massive roster and an approachable yet complex battle system.

Launching on October 11th for Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC, it features an even bigger roster, brand new modes like Episode Battle and Custom Battle, an Edit Mode for creating and sharing scenarios, and much more.

To say that the response has been incredible would be an understatement - it's currently the top-selling title on Steam ahead of release. But what makes Sparking! ZERO one of the biggest games of the year and a can't miss experience? Find out here.
