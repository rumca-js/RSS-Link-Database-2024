In today's Daily Fix:
10 years after Alien: Isolation hit stores, developer Creative Assembly has announced a sequel. The original game's creative director is returning, but no other details were shared. In other news, Halo is undergoing a bit of a reset after developer 343 Industries underwent a name change and company shake-up. Future Halo games will be made with Unreal Engine 5, ditching the Slipspace Engine used for Halo Infinite. And Halo Studios (formerly 343), did confirm that multiple titles are in various stages of development. And finally, weirdos online have taken to Silent Hill 2's Wikipedia page to alter the game's positive reception. The IGN score was changed from an 8 to a 6, Eurogamer's was changed from a 5 out of 5 stars to a 0 out of 5, among others. Wikipedia has since locked the page to prevent anymore tampering, and the cause of the 'vandalism' isn't immediately clear, but the going theory is that it's trolls upset at some cosmetic changes despite the positive sco

Metaphor: ReFantazio reviewed by Michael Higham on PC, also available on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.

There’s a certain familiarity to Metaphor: ReFantazio, but Atlus takes the principles of its already excellent RPGs and refines them in a way that effortlessly ushers you through its brutal, and sometimes whimsical, fantasy world. The Archetype system brings satisfying progression along with all the new wrinkles added to the turn-based combat  for some great hard-fought battles, and the social elements are streamlined to better deliver the most important aspects of the stories they tell. And for all its cliches, there’s a powerful sense of purpose behind this adventure. I felt a unique warmth in its message, because it’s driven by the ideals of a just society and smartly contextualized in surprising ways. Metaphor: ReFantazio is poetic, and at times, idealistic, but it also understands its complexities and that change requires action, and that even far-fetched f
