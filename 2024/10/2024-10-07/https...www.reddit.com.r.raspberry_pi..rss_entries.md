As a long-time Raspberry Pi user I’ve always been a bit disappointed by the limited options for cases on the market… so I decided to design and 3D print my own but I’m still looking for ways to improve it.</p> <p>I’d love to hear your thoughts or suggestions on the design. What would you add or change? I’m also curious about features that other Pi enthusiasts look for in a case.</p> <p>I’m thinking about sharing the design files if there’s enough interest. P.S: I only made the section model to show how it looks on the inside.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/icelandnode"> /u/icelandnode </a> <br/> <span><a hre
