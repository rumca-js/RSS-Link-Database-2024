Fans can create their own fighter to compete with others online and in the game\u2019s Career Mode when Undisputed launches on October 11th . \n\nWhile the graphical polish and animation are impressive, Undisputed doesn\u2019t pretend to supply a worthy replacement to Fight Night\u2019s beloved story mode. There\u2019s no cutscenes or voice acting to be had here, no, this is a text-based management game requiring careful balance of your fighter\u2019s health, finances, and staff. \n\nThe gameplay within the modes of Undisputed is realistic enough, featuring over 60 different punches and a level of polish regarding game performance. There\u2019s a lot of strategy involved here, whether it be through fighter stats, balancing stamina, or anticipating an opponent\u2019s knockout punch. There\u2019s a lot to like with Undisputed, even if there\u2019s some notable flaws here and there.", "id": 1281971, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9b1EuoB6MXQ", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 129, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/9b1EuoB6MXQ/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Undisputed Review - The Final Verdict", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-10-07T15:30:29+00:00", "description": "Remakes have been the rage for a few years, and Until Dawn is no exception. The interactive horror drama became a surprise success after launching in 2015 for the PS4, and while many craved a remaster or PS5 upgrade, Sony has answered with a remake. Helmed by Ballistic Moon, it's out now for PS5 and PC.\n\nOn top of rebuilding it from the ground up with Unreal Engine 5, the remake offers brand new animations, ray traced ambient occlusion and shadows, a new third-person camera, vastly overhauled models with much more details, and more. Fans can even look forward to an updated injury system and altered cinematography for some scenes.\n\nOf course, the big question is how it measures up to the original. Is it a faithful remake, or does it take liberties with what worked nearly a decade ago?

ZERO. Launching on October 11th for Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC, it features an even bigger roster, brand new modes like Episode Battle and Custom Battle, an Edit Mode for creating and sharing scenarios, and much more.\n\nTo say that the response has been incredible would be an understatement - it's currently the top-selling title on Steam ahead of release.
