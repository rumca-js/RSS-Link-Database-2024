Welcome back to Inside Tabletop. In this series I talk to people that live and work in Gaming, getting them to share their insights on the business of game entertainment. 

Today I'm joined by my old boss at GW Jay to talk Dungeons and Dragons 2024! Now that it's out in the wild, how is it being received and how is it landing into a public so divided on Wizards of the Coast and Hasbro in general. 

If you're a Patron; this episode is also available as an exclusive audio Podcast today as well that you'll have already heard three days early!
