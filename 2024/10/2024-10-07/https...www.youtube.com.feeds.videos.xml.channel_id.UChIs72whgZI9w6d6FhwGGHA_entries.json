We talk about the CableMod recall of its angled adapters, including a deep-dive failure analysis into its solutions that we hired a lab for. We also cover PCIe 6/8-pin melting failures of the past and the differences with 12VHPWR. For this content, we collaborated with Aris of Cybenetics (Hardware Busters), Der8auer, Elmor of Elmor Labs, and others to fact check the research.\n\nWith the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 on the horizon, now is a good time to revisit the 12VHPWR standard (and its follow-ups, like 12V-2x6) to try and come to an understanding as to what it all means. This also covers the differences between 12VHPWR and 12V-2x6, alongside other connector standards.\n\nIf you'd like to support ou", "id": 1281919, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y36LMS5y34A", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 428, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UChIs72whgZI9w6d6FhwGGHA", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/Y36LMS5y34A/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "12VHPWR is a Dumpster Fire | Investigation into Contradicting Specs & Corner Cutting", "vote": 0}]
