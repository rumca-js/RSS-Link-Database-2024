Researchers have revealed the cause behind the enormous craters found in Siberia's permafrost, linking them to thawing conditions and explosive methane gas releases. As the surface melts, water seeps into ancient cryopegs, pockets of salty water trapped beneath the permafrost. The resulting pressure build-up causes cracks to form, leading to explosive eruptions that release methane gas stored in the earth. While these events are infrequent, their implications for climate change are significant, as methane is a potent greenhouse gas that can exacerbate global warming, highlighting the urgent need to understand and monitor these unique geological phenomena.

This event allowed fungi to flourish in the aftermath, as they thrived on decaying plant matter. It was found that while the initial partnership formed post-impact, ants did not develop advanced farming techniques until 27 million years ago, during a cooling climate that isolated fungi.

## Ritual Samurai Beheading: New Insights from Translated Edo Period Texts

Four newly translated Japanese texts shed light on samurai beheading rituals from the Edo period (1603-1868). Contrary to popular belief, beheading by a fellow samurai was more common than self-inflicted wounds. The oldest text, The Inner Secrets of Seppuku, emphasizes preparation for these rituals. The treatment of samurai varied based on rank, with high-ranking individuals receiving more elaborate ceremonies, while low-ranking samurai faced harsher methods. The case of Oda Nobunaga raises questions about the complexities of these rituals, challenging existing perceptions of samurai culture.
