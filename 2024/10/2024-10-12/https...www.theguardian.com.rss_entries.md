<ul><li>Heavyweight rematch ends with devastating knockout</li><li>Ben Whittaker bout ends early after freak injury</li></ul><p>Fabio Wardley produced a first-round knockout in his rematch against Frazer Clarke to defend his British heavyweight title in spectacular fashion. The pair had gone the full 12 rounds in their initial fight at London’s O2 Arena in March that had ended in a draw.</p><p>It proved a far shorter affair – around two and a half minutes – in Riyadh on the Artur Beterbiev v Dmitry Bivol undercard. Wardley caught and hurt Clarke with a looping overhand right hand, then sent him to the canvas with a violent follow-up barrage. A dazed Clarke gamely tried to get to his feet but the referee waved the contest off.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/13/fabio-wardley-frazer-clarke-artur-beterbiev-dmitry-bivol-boxing">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Jewish Museum in Berlin buys painting of Weintraubs Syncopators, who played the soundtrack to the Weimar cabaret</p><p>They could play seven instruments each, critics hailed them as the best jazz combo in 1920s Berlin, and the likes of Marlene Dietrich and Josephine Baker fought to secure them as their backing band. But after the Nazi takeover, and frustrating years of exile and internment in Australia, the legacy of Weintraubs Syncopators was lost in the mists of time.</p><p>Now, 100 years after their formation, the Weimar republic’s tightest jazz band returns to the city that once adored them. Not in the flesh, but on canvas: on 21 October, a painting of the group will go on permanent display at the Jewish Museum in Berlin, after the institution acquired it from its previous owners in Canada.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2024/oct/13/nazi-looted-portraits-german-jazz-age-pioneers-berlin-weimar-cabaret">Continue reading...</a>

<p>It was little late and a little lucky too, but the European champions did eventually get the goal that completed their homecoming. Kasper Schmeichel had resisted for 79 minutes but then almost out of nowhere, Martín Zubimendi, the man Liverpool couldn’t convince and whose coach calls the second best midfielder in the world after the man he came to replace, hit a volley that squirmed through the hands of the Denmark keeper and into the net. Just when it seemed that they wouldn’t get a goal to go with the Henri Delaunay trophy, 29,870 people erupted in Murcia, the party ending rather well after all.</p><p>Twenty-four shots it had taken, a deflection too, but Spain had defeated Denmark to go top of the group and mark the occasion with a victory that had looked like it might evade them. Schmeichel had made five saves until then, two of them one-on-ones with Álvaro Morata, but ultimately carried some of the responsibility for defeat on a night when Denmark had their moments. And yet whi

<p>Legal battle between Manchester City and the Premier League highlights the game’s existential crisis – is it too late to save it?</p><p>Don’t look up! As the families of Westeros squabble, the undead gather beyond the Wall. As senior monks jockey to be the new abbot, viking longboats mass on the horizon. As the left bicker interminably over infinitesimal doctrinal differences, right-leaning billionaire tech-bros fund the march of quasi-fascistic populism.</p><p>The problem with existential threats, from the climate crisis to Conquistadors to Covid, is that they always seem distant, somehow unreal. People are always predicting the end of the world, which makes it easy to dismiss the doom-mongers. When we’ve had so many warnings of the apocalypse, why should anybody listen now? But some day one of those prophets is going to be right. Nothing is eternal.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/12/manchester-city-legal-wrangle-premier-league-wealthiest-owners-could-k

Thatcher went on to win three successive general elections.</p><p>Almost 50 years later, we hear the same – that Kemi Badenoch and Robert Jenrick are too extreme to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/oct/09/cock-up-rather-than-conspiracy-the-likely-cause-of-cleverlys-surprise-exit">lead the Tories to victory</a>.

It must feel that way to Seun Kuti, son of the late Nigerian superstar Fela Kuti, who inherited both Fela’s legacy as Afrobeat pioneer and political firebrand, and his group, Egypt 80. Since Fela’s death in 1997, Seun has dutifully tended the Afrobeat flame (as has big brother Femi) while innovating cautiously, using different producers (including Brian Eno) and collaborating widely.</p><p>His fifth album with Egypt 80, and his first in six years, continues the process with executive producer Lenny Kravitz bringing glossy, Stateside elements to the party, while “artistic producer” Sodi Marciszewer, who worked with Fela, keeps things rootsical.

<p>This squad cries out for a coach who could imbue a sense of purpose that goes beyond simply wanting to win something</p><p>There is perhaps a certain bitter comic timing in the fact that England’s next opponent is the country serially ranked as the happiest on earth. Prosperous, equal, well-educated, socially supported and with few delusions of global grandeur, Finland offers our own disgruntled and perennially troubled nation an abundance of useful life lessons, most of which you can guarantee will go unheeded.</p><p>And so to Helsinki, where Lee Carsley apparently has just three games left to save the job that was apparently his after two games, slipping away after three games, and which he does not actually appear to want anyway. Perhaps it was inevitable, given our evident lack of enthusiasm for the Nations League format in general, that English football would use this autumn lacuna as an opportunity to turn entirely in upon itself, to give full rein to its rolling psychodrama,

On its face this seemed an unenviable task; Stewart had hosted for 16 years and it seemed unclear what the show would even be independent of his liberal bona fides and New York sensibility. But Noah’s wit and insight quickly made him a darling of the US left and by bringing an outsider’s perspective – both as a Black man and a recent immigrant – to late-night TV, Noah successfully pushed the show into the social media age.</p><p>Since departing in 2022, Noah has kept busy, launching a podcast, hosting the Grammys, and winning the prestigious Erasmus prize in 2023.
