I am currently using Navidrome on Windows, but it takes very long to load a page and a playlist to play. I have also tried Airsonic before, but also had a lot of problems with load times.</p> <p>It needs to be completely FOSS. Also the server needs to be available for Windows. Preferably also with Android clients, which can also handle loading lots of files.</p> <p>Thank you</p> <p>Darius</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Superdarius\"> /u/Superdarius </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1g1zn7n/can_someone_suggest_a_selfhosted_music_server/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1g1zn7n/can_someone_suggest_a_selfhosted_music_server/\">[comments]</a></span>", "id": 1312461, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1g1zn7n/can_someone_suggest_a_selfhosted_music_server", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 450, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Can someone suggest a selfhosted music server that can handle lots of files?", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-10-12T12:48:23+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi, I&#39;m looking for a way to make things safer for my public facing services, any suggestions?

Public proxies available on mtproto are slow (probably not secure too). </p> <p>I would like to setup a proxy server in my friends windows pc on UK so he can give me a simple proxy which i can put in my telegram app and use it freely. Is it possible? </p> <p>Both of us are not very efficient in networking so we are looking for a simple and straightforward solution. </p> <p>I have searched this sub and found out that tailscale can be used for that but it seems like it creates a VPN, not a proxy ip. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/VagueRumi\"> /u/VagueRumi </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1g1uvqr/proxy_server_for_telegram/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1g1uvq", "id": 1311238, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1g1uvqr/proxy_server_for_telegram", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 450, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Proxy server for Telegram", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-10-12T06:17:57+00:00", "description": "<table> <tr><td> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1g1tyyd/movie_roulette_v21_released/\"> <img src=\"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/9EbI22N8ex-Mkla6VWRjSHCEvb6qGRmZvB4WJFA63zs.jpg\" alt=\"Movie Roulette v2.1 released \" title=\"Movie Roulette v2.1 released \" /> </a> </td><td> <!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hey!</p> <p>I just realesed a new version of Movie Roulette!
