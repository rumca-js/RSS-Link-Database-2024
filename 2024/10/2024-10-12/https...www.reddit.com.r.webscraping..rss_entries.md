<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m talking about parallell processing. Not by using more CPU cores.

I researched celery but it&#39;s got too many issues on windows. Dask seems to be giving me issues. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Salt-Page1396"> /u/Salt-Page1396 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1g233lc/in_python_whats_your_goto_method_to_scale/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1g233lc/in_python_whats_your_goto_method_to_scale/">[comments]</a></span>
