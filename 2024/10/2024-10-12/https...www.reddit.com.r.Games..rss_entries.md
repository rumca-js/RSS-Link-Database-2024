<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Regardless of actual game quality or whether chasing graphics is good for gaming in general. I just want to know what everyone thinks are the best looking games of the moment.</p> <p>Previous generations had really show stoppers every generation.</p> <p>I remember as a kid distinctly playing Tekken 1 for the first time and think &quot;wow, this is so realistic&quot;.</p> <p>I remember the first time I saw Gears of War on the Xbox 360 is kind of took my breath away.</p> <p>Arkham Knight and Uncharted 4 were games in the PS4 era that really wowed me. I even remember being impressed by the quality of the N Sane Trilogy -- looking akin to a Pixar Film in Motion at times.</p> <p>But what about this generation? Alan Wake 2? Cyberpunk&#39;s latest PC updates? Silent Hill 2? Hellbalde 2? Demons Souls Remake? Something like Ratchet and Clank?</p> <p>Which games are really pushing graphics in this era?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="

## What single level/section of a game do you wish they made an entire game out of?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I think I&#39;m not alone when I say I&#39;ve found myself playing a game that I like and suddenly there&#39;s a little section that lets you do something completely different for a bit, and it&#39;s fun as hell, but a few minutes later it&#39;s over and it&#39;s back to the regular game, leaving you wanting more of it. Like, even a whole game of it. </p> <p>To me, it&#39;s the race section from the &quot;Cliffhanger&quot; chapter in <strong>CoD Modern Warfare II</strong>. At one point you gotta ride a snowmobile to escape, and all of a sudden you&#39;re not only dodging trees and obstacles at full speed, but even shooting bad guys on other snowmobiles while you do it, and then jumping a huge chasm across at the end. But...it happens only once, and it lasts barely a minute. </p> <p>After replaying that section over and over, I found myself wishing for a game that was that level but an entire game of it, racing at top speed in first person dangerously

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey! I&#39;m curious what are your favorite single-player open-world game(s) if you disregard the main storyline and focus solely on the open-world &quot;filler&quot;? I&#39;m talking about the Ubisoft-like question marks, towers to climb, dungeons to explore, optional quests and bosses, the world itself, sights to see, etc.</p> <p>Side activities are a big part of open-world games these days, often stretching the &quot;content&quot; and &quot;length&quot; of the game several times over. It&#39;s not unusual for 100% completion to take 4-5 times the hours of the main storyline. However, the quality of this content is debatable; it definitely doesn&#39;t receive as much love and attention as the main storylines do. In most cases, it&#39;s the same thing &quot;copy-pasted&quot; over and over again, hopefully (but not always) with slight customization.</p> <p>Personally, I&#39;m not a big fan of side activities in most open-world games. Usually, I will c
