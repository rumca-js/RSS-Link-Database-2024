<p>Shauna Lawless is an Irish author, whose debut fantasy series the Gael Song has had us here at Grimdark Magazine hooked from the very beginning. The series is a perfect blend of Irish history, mythology, and magic. Now, with the release of the third instalment The Land of the Living and the Dead, we have had the chance to sit and chat with Shauna about the series and what is up next for her. [GdM] Shauna thank you so much for interviewing with us to celebrate the release of The Land of the Living and the Dead. I am a huge fan of the Gael Song series, and this latest novel is a top contender for my favourite read of the year. [SL] Oh, thank you so much!! That is very kind of you to say so. [GdM] Just in case people reading this are new to the series, how would you pitch the Gael Song to new readers? [SL] It is a historical fantasy set in 10th and 11th century Ireland. The fantastical elements are derived from Irish mythology and based on two tribes—the Tuatha Dé Danann and the Fomor
