Why is it happening? Can it be fixed? Looking for answers on this, I found myself tumbling down a rabbit hole, with this game - and others based on Unreal Engine 5 - presenting issues even more concerning than big lurches on the frame-time graph. Shader compilation stutter? That's not an issue in Silent Hill 2. Traversal stutter? Well, unfortunately that is - and it's highly problematic. However, similar to <a data-keyword=\"true\" href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-jedi-survivor\">Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</a>, there's also animation stutter. Even if you manage to stabilise performance, it's still impossible to enjoy a smooth, consistent experience in Silent Hill 2.

One of similar size and similar tone: thoughtful, brooding, dark. A game about drinking blood to sustain yourself and fighting demons, yes, but also about deciding what kind of vampire you want to be, and what kinds of morals you, as an undead being, want to have.
