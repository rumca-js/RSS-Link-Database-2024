## Ask HN: What is it with this hate and disdain for interns/junior engineers?

<p>Some examples of this that I have seen so often:<p>No openings for interns or junior engineers, yet the companies and people I talk with, the senior engineers get sick often, lack drive and take longer PTO and their work isn't really that adequate.<p>Blaming interns or junior engineers for simple mistakes, which the senior which also should have seen.<p>Not training interns or junior engineers to become senior and be given more responsibility, I'm assuming we are all aware of the bus factor here.<p>All the while where some really smart interns or junior engineers come out of prestigious institutions (Oxford, Cambridge, MIT, Stanford, Harvard, etc), with a stunning body of work and can absolutely run rings around engineers that are called 'senior' in title only and don't have a body of work to show when they leave.<p>It is no wonder senior engineers are finding the job market tough now, but it is obviously even worse for juniors, and all the above doesn't help.<p>Of course, everyon

<p>AOO is a lightweight and flexible peer-to-peer audio streaming and messaging solution. It allows to send audio and messages in real-time and on demand between network endpoints - not only in local networks, but also over the public internet!<p>The C/C++ library can be easily embedded in host applications or plugins. It even runs on embedded devices, such as the ESP32. In addition, the project contains a Pure Data external and a SuperCollider extension.<p>The following article provides a high level introduction and demonstrates some use cases: <a href="https://www.soundingfuture.com/en/article/aoo-low-latency-peer-peer-audio-streaming-and-messaging" rel="nofollow">https://www.soundingfuture.com/en/article/aoo-low-latency-pe...</a><p>AOO has been in development since 2020 and it has been used in several art projects since. Now it has finally reached a stage where I feel comfortable presenting it to a larger public.<p>This is still a pre-release and I want to get more feedback before

## Ask HN: Best AI Code Assistant?

<p>I would like to hear the community's opinion on the best code assistant they've tried. Ideally, I'm looking for something that allows experienced backend developers to save time (targeting languages C# and Java) and is good at handling boilerplate and complex requests. So far, I've tried Copilot, but to say that I'm disappointed is an understatement. It's essentially just auto-complete on steroids (when it works), and I don't see any real value. What's your experience?</p>
