<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone,</p> <p>I know it&#39;s very possible to &quot;stack&quot; these two things together, but I&#39;m trying to avoid that if possible.</p> <p>I&#39;m looking for:</p> <ul> <li>An RSS feed aggregator</li> </ul> <p>Which also supports:</p> <ul> <li>Creating nice dashboards that are suitable for running in &quot;kiosk mode&quot; (ie, devices left on all the time without an expectation for user interaction)</li> </ul> <p>Use-case is actually not business related at all (which is why I think I&#39;m having a hard time avoiding super expensive enterprise tools!). I just want to create a couple of slick news monitoring setups for home use.</p> <p>An example of why I&#39;m looking for a two-in-one specifically: it would be great to get a joined-up function like being able to automatically toggle between groups of feeds every X minutes.</p> <p>Feedly &amp; Inoreader both look great but as far as I can tell neither (quite) do this with the dashboards.<
