I colorized, restored and created a sound design for this video of Scenes from Copenhagen 1920s, we can clearly see what's happening in broad daylight

Video Restoration Process:
✔ FPS boosted to 60 frames per second 
✔ Image resolution boosted up to HD 
✔ Improved video sharpness and brightness 
✔ Colorized only for the ambiance (not historically accurate)
✔added sound only for the ambiance
✔restoration:(stabilisation,denoise,cleand,deblur) 
✔ SKY Visual Effects (not historically accurate)

Please, be aware that colorization colors and SKY Visual Effects are not real and fake, colorization and VFX was made only for the ambiance and do not represent real historical data.
