<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello!</p> <p>I was wondering has anyone attempted to customised the Headless api of Django All auth to allow for custom fields such as first_nam etc… it seems to be hardcoded while it can be configured for the Form in template mode…</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/gaspard-m"> /u/gaspard-m </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/1g29rk0/django_all_haut_headless_custom_signup/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/1g29rk0/django_all_haut_headless_custom_signup/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone! I have a Django project where I used mypy and django stubs as part of my workflow. The issue is that on occasion mypy will detect errors undeterministically (sometimes errors are detected and sometimes they are not). For example, I will have a file where I have ensured to remove any errors. I will run mypy on that file and mypy will not detect any errors after several runs but then, it will detect an error in that file for a couple runs and then, changing nothing, the errors go away. I&#39;m not really sure why it has this behavior but I&#39;m curious if anyone has encountered this issue and if so what was the cause and how did you solve it. For context, I&#39;m using Python 3.12.1, Django 5.0, mypy 1.10, and django-stubs 5.0.2. That&#39;s all the information I give out. That&#39;s for the help in advance!!!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ThaRainmaker01"> /u/ThaRainmaker01 </a> <br/
