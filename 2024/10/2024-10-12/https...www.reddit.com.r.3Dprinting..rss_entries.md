To my knowledge this artifact of my visit is one of the earliest known specimens of fused metal deposition 3D printing.</p> <p>There were probably 25 of us at this symposium. It was most likely advertised in NASA tech brief magazine at the time, which I was an avid reader. The sample part is non-magnetic and I am unsure of the exact alloy. I wish I could go back in time and convince myself that this technology was going to be feasible someday in the future.</p> <p>Part is on a Olfa mat, units are inch. It measures about 0.80&quot; tall.<
