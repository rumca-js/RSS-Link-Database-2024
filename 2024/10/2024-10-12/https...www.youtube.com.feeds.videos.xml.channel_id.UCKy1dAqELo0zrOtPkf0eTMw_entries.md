With the release of Silent Hill 2 Remake from Bloober Team, I figured now would be the ideal time to explore where all the fog in Silent Hill comes from. While it was once used to mask the hardware limitations of the PlayStation at the time by shrouding players in both fog and snow, Silent Hill as a franchise is now synonymous with fog. But where does all the fog come from? Is it a manifestation of the tormented thoughts those who’re drawn to the sleepy town of Silent Hill are plagued with? Or could it simply be due to the location of this fictional American town? In this video, IGN’s Akeem Lawanson gets to the bottom of it all - even consulting an actual weatherman and meteorologist. If you’ve been a fan of #SilentHill, currently playing #SilentHill2Remake, a longtime fan of #SilentHill2 or simply curious about the creepy world that lies within Silent Hill, you’re going to want to check this one out!

Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero reviewed by Jarrett Green on PlayStation 5, also available on PC and Xbox Series X|S.

Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero is a final flash from the past, sometimes to a fault, as demonstrated by its archaic menus and remedial training tools. Its Episode Battles have the kind of reaction-heavy difficulty that doesn’t really exist in most games these days, more than once crossing the line between challenging and frustrating. But the feeling of traveling back to a simpler time when games didn’t have to be balanced or competitive to be fun is a good one, especially when that action stays so true to that of the show it’s recreating. Reliving a story that was foundational to my youth, looking and sounding as great as I remember it, with the opportunity to alter it in sometimes dramatic new ways is clever, and the addition of tools to attempt to create our own stories could elevate the experiment even further if a community can figure out how to make the most of them.
