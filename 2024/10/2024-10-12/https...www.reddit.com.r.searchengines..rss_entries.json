But it seems kind of difficult to tell how much of Google and Bing is in other search engines when they claim they&#39;re &quot;independently indexed&quot;. </p> <p>I know Mojeek should be using its own index, also saw this Stract thing. Brave Search may also. But stuff like Qwant and Ecosia seem like Bing frontends as well. And Kagi uses a mix of Google and Bing to my knowledge (although has really good filter tools). </p> <p>Is there a definitive list of all search engines that tell you if they use their own index or not? I plan to use all that do since just relying on Google and Bing seems pretty limiting when they&#39;re so corporately driven.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/EpicFrogPoster\"> /u/EpicFrogPoster </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/", "id": 1313817, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/searchengines/comments/1g26sty/search_engines_with_their_own_indexes", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 463, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/searchengines/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Search engines with their own indexes?", "vote": 0}]
