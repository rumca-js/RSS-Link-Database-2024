<p>The 120 days that passed between Scotland opening Euro 2024 and this encounter in Zagreb have been chastening for Steve Clarke. A tame exit from those finals followed by a poor start to the Nations League has seen patience towards the Scotland manager wear thin. One win in 14 became one win in 15 courtesy of this Croatia victory but the circumstances attached were particularly sore for Scotland. With the last kick of the ball, Ché Adams believed he had snatched a point. Enter the video assistant referee, who ruled out the goal for offside. Clarke, briefly jubilant, cut an understandably despondent figure.</p><p>Should Scotland’s run ­continue until the end of this section, there will be questions raised over Clarke’s suitability to lead his ­country into World Cup qualifying. That may seem unduly harsh – this is a ­manager not only painfully short on resource but one who has guided Scotland to ­consecutive European Championships – but is the law of this particular jungle.</p> <a hr

<p>Simple suppers that are ready in 30 minutes – and so good you’ll want to make them at the weekend too</p><p>What makes a midweek meal a midweek meal? The term implies that bandwidth is fairly low, so something pretty straightforward is called for. Anything that takes longer than half an hour to make is out of the question for most people, and no one wants to spend ages on the washing-up. That’s why one-pan dishes are so popular, and why ingredients that hit our midweek comfort needs – pasta or cheese, say – feature so often. At the same time, however, midweek meals aren’t just about instant carbs and melted cheese. More often than not, in fact, much depends on what sort of week you’re having. (Spoiler alert: these dishes work very well at weekends, too.)</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/oct/12/yotam-ottolenghi-midweek-meals-recipes-squash-carbonara-kimchi-soup">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Cooper’s novel is full of wisdom, wit and emotional intelligence. When put on screen, even the gratuitous sex feels oddly wholesome</p><p>It begins, of course, with bonking. A closeup on a bare male bottom, thrusting energetically in a Concorde loo. Cries of ecstasy float over a soundtrack of Robert Palmer’s Addicted to Love as the plane hits supersonic and the flight attendant pops the champagne. It can only be Jilly Cooper, and that bottom can only be Rupert Campbell-Black – champion show jumper, international heart-throb, Tory sports minister, braying toff, absolute shit. Lock up your telly remote, because Rivals – that most gloriously 1980s piece of doorstopper fiction, Blighty’s answer to Tom Wolfe’s Bonfire of the Vanities – has landed on our screens.</p><p>Full disclosure. I am a Jilly Cooper super fan. Dame Jilly is my heroine, and Rivals would be my Desert Island Discs book of choice. I took my daughter’s name, Pearl, from one of her books. So ardent is my love for Jilly t

Their British and Commonwealth heavyweight title bout was a ferocious and gripping contest that ended in a draw and the rematch will take place in Riyadh on Saturday night. Clarke had been knocked down heavily in the fifth round but the canvas was splattered mostly with the blood of Wardley, who also went through hell.</p><p>Before he considers the prospect of returning to a dark place in the ring with Wardley, Clarke talks in riveting detail about the consequences of that first bout at London’s 0<sub>2</sub> Arena. “My girlfriend, Danni, had gone to bed because she was emotionally drained.

Osho denounced traditional religion, offering a new path to self-liberation through cathartic meditations and therapy groups, communal living and free love. In the west, they called Osho the “sex guru”.</p><p>Shortly after our arrival at Rajneesh’s ashram, I was initiated into the community and the guru gave me a new name: Ma Prem Sarito.
