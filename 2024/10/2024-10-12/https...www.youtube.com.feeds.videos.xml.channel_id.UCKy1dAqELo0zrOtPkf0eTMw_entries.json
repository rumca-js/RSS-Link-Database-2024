Zero reviewed by Jarrett Green on PlayStation 5, also available on PC and Xbox Series X|S.\n\nDragon Ball: Sparking!

Its Episode Battles have the kind of reaction-heavy difficulty that doesn\u2019t really exist in most games these days, more than once crossing the line between challenging and frustrating. But the feeling of traveling back to a simpler time when games didn\u2019t have to be balanced or competitive to be fun is a good one, especially when that action stays so true to that of the show it\u2019s recreating. Reliving a story that was foundational to my youth, looking and sounding as great as I remember it, with the opportunity to alter it in sometimes dramatic new ways is clever, and the addition of tools to attempt to create our own stories could elevate the experiment even further if a community can figure out how to make the most of them.", "id": 1310690, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqOH3zqtfCM", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 149, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/SqOH3zqtfCM/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Dragon Ball: Sparking!
