Thank you ASUS for helping with today's video. If you want to grab your own PG27AQDP or check out ASUS' other displays, head over to https://lmg.gg/aqdp

With OLED’s lightning fast pixel response times and a 480Hz refresh rate, we’re reaching levels of motion clarity we never thought possible! Couple that with a great HDR experience and it’s really hard to beat the PG27AQDP from Asus.
