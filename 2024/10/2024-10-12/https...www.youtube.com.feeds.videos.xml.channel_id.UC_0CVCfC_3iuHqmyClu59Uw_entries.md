In this video we added a powerful Graphics card to this new Lunar lake powered laptop and the results are pretty wild! This isn the new ASUS Zenbook S14 powered by the Intel Core Ultra 258V, by its self the new 140V iGPU is great but i needed a bit more in docked mode so we deciced to see how well lunar lake works with a Thunderbolt 4/ USB4 eGPU like the Nvidia Geforce RTX 2070 Ti Super. we also see is an older Thunderbolt 3 GPU dock and do the job or not.
