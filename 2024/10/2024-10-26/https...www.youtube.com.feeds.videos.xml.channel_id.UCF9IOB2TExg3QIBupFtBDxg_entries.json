The pandemic coincided with a period of fifty years from the recognition of a communicating mucosal immune system. John Bienenstock called this \u201cThe Common Mucosal Immune System\u201d (CMS). Lessons relevant to Covid on the relevance of mucosal immunity to both the pathogenesis of disease and vaccination strategies were slowly learnt. Early in the pandemic, protracted changes in the intestinal microbiota were noted that correlated with the progress and severity of infection, and later were linked to dev", "id": 1392155, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rcxd3X0ZEw", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 96, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCF9IOB2TExg3QIBupFtBDxg", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/7rcxd3X0ZEw/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Common mucosal system and immunity", "vote": 0}]
