<p>Manchester City keep powering on in a relentless mode that tells Liverpool and Arsenal they must do the same.

Guardiola’s charges were a touch flat here. Recently, he has preached the need to be patient and though Erling Haaland could have had a hat-trick instead of his solitary winner, injuries meant the manager had scant resources on the bench to change up his team, with only Ilkay Gündogan an attack-minded senior option.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/26/manchester-city-southampton-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Does Charlie Simpson regret choosing Sigur Rós? Did Chesney Hawkes play ‘that’ song? And who picked an eight-minute jam by LCD Soundsystem? Musicians on the songs they chose for their wedding dance, for better or for worse</p><p>There’s an enormous amount of pressure for couples choosing the right song to soundtrack their wedding’s first dance. It’s not just that it’s three minutes (or more) where all your friends and family are staring at you. It’s also about what that song says about you and your relationship. What about when you’re a musician getting married? Choose wrong and, well, it’s not just your career in question. A range of musicians across different genres have bravely put their reputations on the line for you to judge – and not all of them stand by their choices …</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/oct/26/musicians-wedding-songs-charlie-simpson-chesney-hawkes-kate-pierson">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Striker once mooted as a makeweight for Newcastle’s Alexander Isak is now outperforming his attacking rival</p><p>It was an idea briefly explored, a conversation that soon died a death, but there was a moment last summer when Chelsea were talking about including Nicolas Jackson as part of a deal that would have taken Newcastle’s Alexander Isak in the opposite direction.</p><p>There was much admiration for Isak at Chelsea. They were keen to add a top striker to Enzo Maresca’s squad and the Sweden international was prominent in their thoughts. Was a deal possible? Newcastle had concerns regarding profitability and sustainability regulations, although they were never going to sell Isak on the cheap. The only way to make it work was to follow the route favoured by a lot of Premier League clubs: alter the fee by throwing in players as part of the bargain.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/26/nicolas-jackson-shrugs-off-faltering-start-to-fill-chelseas-no-9-slot"

<p>As a senator, I’ve seen how major parties conspired with the military to manipulate elections and crush opponents. This can’t go on</p><p>For most of its history, Pakistan has been ruled by military dictators. Brief democratic intervals were only possible because the military became so hugely unpopular that it was left with no other option than to temporarily cede space to democracy. The last military dictator was forced to quit in 2008, and Pakistan has since seen the longest spell of civilian control in its history. Instead of moving forward, it has slid backwards, and was <a href="https://www.geo.tv/latest/531351-eiu-democracy-index-pakistan-downgraded-to-authoritarian-regime-from-hybrid-regime">downgraded last year</a> from a “hybrid” to an “authoritarian” regime.

<p>The Nobel laureate’s riff on The Magic Mountain takes on a darkly surreal life of its own in this tale of a young man’s visit to a health resort</p><p>In Amundsen, a short story by Alice Munro, a young woman comes to teach at a sanatorium during the second world war. Asked by a doctor what she knows about tuberculosis (TB), she tells him she has read The Magic Mountain. Like the Alpine peak above Davos on which it takes place, Thomas Mann’s 1924 novel casts its vast shadow over any fictional work about illness, let alone those set in TB clinics.</p><p>The Empusium, which the Nobel laureate Olga Tokarczuk has called her “retelling” of The Magic Mountain, takes place in the Silesian settlement of Görbersdorf, the real-life model for the sanatorium at Davos. Like Mann’s “simple young fellow” Hans Castorp, Mieczysław Wojnicz is also apparently unremarkable, a 24-year-old sanitation engineer who arrives at Görbersdorf with a mild case of TB. But there are hints too of a more troubling,

I was 19 and studying fine art at Goldsmiths, and it turned my head like nothing before. For a young person looking for answers and clues, to have that sort of book was eye-opening. It uncovered and revealed things. And then I read his masterpiece, <a href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/books/9780674076068">The Black Atlantic</a>. It was huge. His ideas about modernity and double-consciousness represented a major shift in thinking throughout the world.

<p>A new British Museum exhibition gives a taste of the rich cultures along these ancient routes, but a trip to central Asia offers much more – stunning architecture, moreish food and wild trekking</p><p>A small mountainous jewel of a country wedged between Afghanistan and China, Tajikistan has changed since I first visited it as a backpacker in 2009. Back then, landing in the diminutive capital, Dushanbe, at 3am, a permit for trekking and letter of invitation in hand, I was met by a virtually deserted airport and a city lit by few electric lights. Nowadays, you can get a visa on arrival, and everything in Dushanbe is louder, brighter and faster.</p><p>Countless construction sites disrupt the capital and there has been much misjudged demolition of old theatres, teahouses and cinemas built during the Soviet era, causing (some) outrage. But it is hard to be too down on the city’s central artery, Rudaki Avenue. Partly canopied by mature trees, and with statues, fountains and parks, it r

If he told his Jehovah’s Witness parents that he was gay, they would be honour-bound to inform the church elders, and that would be the end of life as he knew it. If he didn’t tell them, he would be forced into a world of deceit or denial. He chose God.</p><p>Evans became the youngest boy in his south Wales congregation to be baptised. He formally and publicly devoted his life to Jehovah. If he came out as gay now, he would be banished from the church. All upstanding members of the congregation, including his mother and father, would be expecte

The effect is like staring into a kaleidoscope. It’s a fairytale sight, the intricate white-painted fronts and curved balconies resembling a collection of adult-sized doll’s houses.</p><p>The fantasy quickly falls apart, though. Many of the castles further into the complex have only bare concrete facades.
