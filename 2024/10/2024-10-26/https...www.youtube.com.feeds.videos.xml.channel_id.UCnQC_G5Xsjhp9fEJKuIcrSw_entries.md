Bishop Robert Barron is a renowned Catholic theologian and author, often cited as ‚Äúthe Bishop of the Internet‚Äù for his innovative approach to evangelization in the modern world. Through his Word on Fire ministry, Bishop Barron produces and publishes books, documentaries, sermons, and podcasts that spread the gospel to over 200 million viewers online. In today‚Äôs episode, Bishop Barron and I dissect contemporary myths about traditional religion and delve into the underlying presumptions of a secular society. We also explore the ideological tension between virtue and freedom, and whether the pursuit of unqualified liberty is as useful as we might think. Stay tuned and don‚Äôt miss this episode with Bishop Robert Barron on The Sunday Special.
