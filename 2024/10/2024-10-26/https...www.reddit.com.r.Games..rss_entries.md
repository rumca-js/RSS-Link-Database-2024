<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>&quot;The original plan was for the 3 cities to be on separate maps. The player would travel between the cities using trains and planes. (Gta 1 and 2 also had three cities on separate maps)</p> <p>Memory was very tight on the ps2 and with separate maps, the other cities‚Äô skyline models wouldn‚Äôt have to be in memory.</p> <p>It would also make it easier to have different police/ambulance/firetrucks for each city. Different pickups, weather types etc.</p> <p>It would also be easier to contain the player until it was time for the next city.</p> <p>It would also make it easier to organize the models on the DVD city-by-city which would help the streaming.</p> <p>Just before the artists started working on the three maps, we had a final meeting at R* North in which we changed our minds and decided to go for a big map after all.</p> <p>We still ended up doing city-specific pickups, police cars and weather.</p> <p>Happy birthday San Andreas.
