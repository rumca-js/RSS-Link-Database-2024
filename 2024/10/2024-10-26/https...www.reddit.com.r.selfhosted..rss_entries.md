<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Just trying to make sure I&#39;m doing this correctly as someone with a very basic understanding of networks and protocols. Essentially I want an easy way to share my JellyFin server which is run off my main PC with my friends and family. I also use Mullvad VPN on my main PC and would like to continue using a VPN going forward. </p> <p>Today I set up Tailscale and excluded the app through split tunneling on Mullvad. Am I correct here in assuming that this provides me with the privacy of the VPN for anything else done on my PC but allows access for others I invite to my Tailscale list to my JellyFin media? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Old_Log_8638"> /u/Old_Log_8638 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1gcxvfv/tailscale_and_mullvad_sharing_jellyfin_with_others/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1gcxvfv/tailscal

I only use Nextcloud for storing and syncing files and for calendar. </p> <p>Lately I have found Nextcloud too complicated to configure, bringing up too many errors or warnings and taking too much performances for what I use it. I am using the community edition and not Nextcloud AIO since I have my own reverse proxy.</p> <p>So I am looking for an alternative more file oriented (and can include real time syncing on the connected devices) as well as another self hosted app for managing calendars, all integrating well behind an authentication server. The idea is to breakdown my use case into separated services doing their only job but very well (Linux philosophy)</p> <p>I am
