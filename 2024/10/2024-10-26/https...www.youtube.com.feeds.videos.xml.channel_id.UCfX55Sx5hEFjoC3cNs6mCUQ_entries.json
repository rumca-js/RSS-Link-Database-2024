I'll also quickly touch on merge queues, and mention some RBE backends that support the feature. --- If you run builds on every master commit, and you have commits landing more quickly than your slowest action can finish, you'll end up rebuilding unnecessarily.

Everything from services deployed on bare-metal Kubernetes to AWS Lambda functions depend on container images. Building these images quickly and efficiently is critical to keeping CI/CD responsive. In recent years, Stripe has undergone dual migrations. One, to a service oriented architecture. Two, to running services inside Kubernetes. Together, these migrations meant our CI pipelines to build containers became slower and more expensive with each passing month. With a build producing over a terabyte of images, Bazel just couldn't build them fast enough! Even disk space was in short supply.
