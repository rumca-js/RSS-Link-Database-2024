<p class="has-drop-cap has-text-align-none">The third season of the animated series <em>The Legend of Vox Machina </em>is now streaming in full, and the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/critical-role">Critical Role</a> role-playing team is ready to talk about it —&nbsp;without digging into spoilers just yet.</p>
