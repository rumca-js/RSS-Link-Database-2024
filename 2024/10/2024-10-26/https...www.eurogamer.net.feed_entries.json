Of course, F1 24 already has an impressive set of modes on the regular, base PS5, including support for 120fps gaming - and the same quality/performance divide remains on Pro, but with a range of enhancements for each. There's also a new 'resolution' mode that unlocks only when the Pro is connected to an 8K screen. We went hands on at the studio on PS5 Pro development hardware and while the code wasn't quite final, the upgrade is clearly impressive, particularly in the 60fps quality mode, where the EGO engine's ray tracing features are used extensively.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-202", "id": 1392569, "language": "en-gb", "link": "https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-f1-24s-ps5-pro-upgrade-delivers-a-curated-mix-of-higher-end-pc-features", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 107, "source_url": "https://www.eurogamer.net/feed", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/F1-SITE_9r1UN4L.jpg?width=1920&height=1920&fit=bounds&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp", "title": "F1 24 tested on PS5 Pro: ray tracing and PSSR raise visual quality to new heights", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-10-26T13:17:43+00:00", "description": "<img src=\"https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-six-two-character-shooting-at-each-other.jpg?width=1920&height=1920&fit=bounds&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp\" /> <p>Call of Duty <a data-keyword=\"true\" href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024\">Black Ops 6</a> is currently sitting on a \"mixed\" Steam user score as players on PC report performance issues and crashes.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-sits-on-mixed-steam-user-score-as-players-report-performance-issues\">Read more</a></p>", "id": 1392570, "language": "en-gb", "link": "https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-sits-on-mixed-steam-user-score-as-players-report-performance-issues", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 107, "source_url": "https://www.eurogamer.net/feed", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-six-two-character-shooting-at-each-other.jpg?width=1920&height=1920&fit=bounds&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp", "title": "Call of Duty Black Ops 6 sits on \"mixed\" Steam user score as players report performance issues", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-10-26T10:50:28+00:00", "description": "<img src=\"https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/xbox-cloud-gaming-tv-promo.jpg?width=1920&height=1920&fit=bounds&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp\" /> <p>Xbox remains committed to \"bringing great games to more people on more devices\", and plans to \"extend\" its strategy to bring its most notable franchises to other platforms like PS5 and Nintendo Switch.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-reaffirms-commitment-to-bringing-great-games-to-more-people-on-more-devices\">Read more</a></p>", "id": 1392156, "language": "en-gb", "link": "https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-reaffirms-commitment-to-bringing-great-games-to-more-people-on-more-devices", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 107, "source_url": "https://www.eurogamer.net/feed", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/xbox-cloud-gaming-tv-promo.jpg?width=1920&height=1920&fit=bounds&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp", "title": "Xbox reaffirms commitment to \"bringing great games to more people on more devices\"", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-10-26T09:03:11+00:00", "description": "<img src=\"https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Dragon-Age-Origins-Retrospective-3.jpg?width=1920&height=1920&fit=bounds&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp\" /> <p>Going back to <a data-keyword=\"true\" href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dragon-age-origins\">Dragon Age: Origins</a> today for what was far from my first playthrough, I realised it's never really had a true sequel (or if maybe that's a little harsh for some: it's never had a sequel that followed it's classic RPG spirit in quite the same way). Yes, the world of Thedas has been further explored by Hawke and The Inquisitor - with Rook soon to be added to the list of overworked protagonists with a mate called Varric - but it's never felt like the spirit of Origin's Dungeons and Dragons-inspired design has ever truly been iterated on within the franchise.
