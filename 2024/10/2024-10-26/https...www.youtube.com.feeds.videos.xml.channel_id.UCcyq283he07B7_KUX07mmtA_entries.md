Pulque is the oldest ancestor of two of Mexico’s most popular alcoholic drinks, tequila and mezcal. It’s not nearly as popular as the other two, but that wasn’t always the case. In the late 1800s, pulque was Mexico’s most-consumed alcoholic drink. But untrue rumors that it was fermented with feces, its reputation as a drink for the poor, and competition from the beer industry nearly made pulque completely disappear. Now, young Mexicans are fueling a renaissance of the dying beverage. So can pulque become a global hit like tequila and mezcal? And how, against all odds, is it still standing?
