The JetKVM is a tiny IP KVM that lets you control any computer, anywhere.

Disclaimer: JetKVM sent me the two units I tested in this video. I did not pay for them. And they did not pay for this video, nor have any control over what I said in it.

I did back their Kickstarter, but as with all Kickstarters, the standard caveat applies: you are not buying anything, you are simply pledging money towards a hope and a dream that the product may someday appear. Many Kickstarters fail. I don't think this one will, but I can't promise it will, either.
