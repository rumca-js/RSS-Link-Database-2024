The Covid pandemic drew attention to the distinctive system of mucosal immunity and its limited interplay with systemic immunity with which we were more familiar. The pandemic coincided with a period of fifty years from the recognition of a communicating mucosal immune system. John Bienenstock called this “The Common Mucosal Immune System” (CMS). Lessons relevant to Covid on the relevance of mucosal immunity to both the pathogenesis of disease and vaccination strategies were slowly learnt. Early in the pandemic, protracted changes in the intestinal microbiota were noted that correlated with the progress and severity of infection, and later were linked to dev
