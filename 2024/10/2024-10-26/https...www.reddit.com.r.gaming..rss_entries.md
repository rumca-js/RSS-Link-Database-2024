Going diagonal for full speed and dodging geometry almost makes it feel like I&#39;m playing a game within a game and adds a layer of skill.</p> <p>It&#39;s not realistic by any means and can be janky. But I really do think a lot of games nowadays would benefit, from a little bit more arcady movement just for the sake of having fun.

It used to be so easy to hop in a couple of lobbies and over a few weeks or months build a network of players who loved to party up to shoot the breeze/banter.
