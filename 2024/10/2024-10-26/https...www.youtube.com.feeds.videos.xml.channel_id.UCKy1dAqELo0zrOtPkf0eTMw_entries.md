The Venom movies may not be critical darlings, but they certainly have a respectable fanbase all their own. 2018’s Venom introduced us to Tom Hardy’s crusading reporter-turned-symbiotic superhero Eddie Brock. 2021’s Venom: Let There Be Carnage brought one of the Marvel Universe’s greatest rivalries into live-action. And now, in Venom: The Last Dance, the trilogy comes to a close. If Sony is to be believed, this is the final outing for Hardy’s Eddie Brock. There’s just one problem. We never got a Spider-Man/Venom team-up.

Why didn’t Spider-Man and Venom ever directly cross paths in these movies? Why did Sony set about the impossible challenge of establishing Venom without the hero partly responsible for his creation?

Venom: The Last Dance is directed by Kelly Marcel and stars Tom Hardy,  Chiwetel Ejiofor, Juno Temple, Rhy
