<p>Google is reportedly working on a new Android API for what it’s calling Rich Ongoing Notifications, which would allow apps to display at-a-glance information in a status bar much like Apple’s Live Activities in the Dynamic Island on iPhone. This is according to journalist <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-16-rich-ongoing-notifications-3494349/" data-original-link="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-16-rich-ongoing-notifications-3494349/"><ins>Mishaal Rahman</ins></a>, who spotted the code in the Android 15 QPR1 Beta 3 release. It could work a lot like the time tracker that currently appears when you’re on a phone call, with a bit of text in a bubble at the top of the display that you can tap to open the app for more details.</p>
<p>Writing for <em>Android Authority</em>, Rahman says the API “will let apps create chips with their own text and background color that live in t

<p>The legal battle between Apple and medical technology company Masimo rages on, with the bigger company — sorta, kinda — winning their latest face off. A federal jury has agreed with Apple that previous versions of Masimo&#39;s W1 and Freedom (pictured above) watches infringed on its design patents, according to <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/masimo-smartwatches-infringe-apple-patents-us-jury-says-2024-10-25/"><em>Reuters</em></a>. It only awarded Apple $250 in damages, which is the smallest amount that could be awarded for patent infringement, but the company&#39;s lawyers reportedly told the court that it wasn&#39;t after money anyway.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What Apple, which is worth $3.5 trillion, wanted was an injunction on the sales of Masimo&#39;s current smartwatch models. However, the jury determined that those newer models don&#39;t violate Apple&#39;s intellectual property. That is why Masimo is also treating the jury&#39;s decision as a win, telli

The lawsuit accused the company of making &quot;numerous false and misleading claims&quot; in the advertisements it released in 2021 and 2022, when the demand for rides recovered following COVID-19 lockdowns in the previous years. Lyft promised drivers up to $43 an hour in some locations, the FTC said, without revealing that those numbers were based on the earnings of its top drivers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The rates it published allegedly didn&#39;t represent drivers&#39; average earnings and inflated actual earnings by up to 30 percent. Further, the FTC said that Lyft &quot;failed to di
