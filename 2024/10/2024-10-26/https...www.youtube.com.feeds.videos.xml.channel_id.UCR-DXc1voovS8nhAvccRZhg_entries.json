Sign up for Notion AI at https://ntn.so/JeffGeerling. #NotionPartner #Notion #NotionAI\n\nThe JetKVM is a tiny IP KVM that lets you control any computer, anywhere.\n\nFind out more: https://jetkvm.com\n\nDisclaimer: JetKVM sent me the two units I tested in this video. I did not pay for them. And they did not pay for this video, nor have any control over what I said in it.\n\nI did back their Kickstarter, but as with all Kickstarters, the standard caveat applies: you are not buying anything, you are simply pledging money towards a hope and a dream that the product may someday appear. Many Kickstarters fail. I don't think this one will, but I can't promise it will, either.\n\nA few other things I mentioned in this video (some links are affiliate links):\n\n  - GMKTek G3 N100 Mini PC: https://amzn.to/3zYmo8c\n  - USB-C power/data splitter: https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256803607115029.html\n  - Pi-KVM v4: https://pikvm.org/buy/\n  - Sipeed NanoKVM Revie", "id": 1392962, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pYfHedjjgw", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 161, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCR-DXc1voovS8nhAvccRZhg", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/6pYfHedjjgw/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "THAT'S a KVM?!", "vote": 0}]
