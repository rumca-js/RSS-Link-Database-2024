<ul><li>British boxer wins super-lightweight fight in Manchester</li><li>Judges score 116-109, 116-109, 117-110 in Catterall’s favour</li></ul><p>Jack Catterall took a significant step towards finally becoming a world champion when he beat Regis Prograis in a strange and messy 12–round super-lightweight contest. Catterall sealed his victory by lopsided and generous scores of 116-109, twice, and 117-10 over the former two-time world champion.</p><p>A fight in which a chess match turned into a slugfest featured three knockdowns, the first scored by Prograis, as well as wild swings and misses with both boxers slipping and tumbling to the canvas. Prograis also seemed to hurt his ankle and leg near the end of the bout and the American was as gracious as he was philosophical as his own career appears to have ended in Manchester.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/27/jack-catterall-beats-regis-prograis-on-points-to-move-closer-to-title-showdown">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Is it a betrayal to speak the harsh truth that childbirth can cost a mother’s body in ways that will never fully repair? To speak only of the wonderment of a new human?</p><p>I thought it was stupendous, giving birth. I felt like an Amazon, pushing out those wonder-children – long and hefty, smooth pudgy skin, so tender under my hand. It was a miracle of world-making to see a whole human unfurl from my womb. But this other shocking reality: torn flesh, lumpy stitches, burning urine, painful pooing. A visceral damage – but one I thought would be short-lived.</p><p>When I had my two children over 30 years ago, I was a fan of the policy of the public hospital birthing centre: 24-hours-then-home-you-go. I thought I only needed an overnight or two in hospital before I whizzed home with our newborn. I didn’t see any sense in medicalising birth. It was, after all, a natural process. There was little awareness of or planning for the time a body needed for healing and repair.</p> <a href="

<p></p><p>Life is good lived on the edge. Barcelona played the clásico atop a high-wire, a perfect plan executed with precision and without fear, and finished it at the top of the table, their wonderful week complete. Three days after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/23/barcelona-bayern-munich-champions-league-match-report">they scored four against Bayern Munich</a> to exorcise those European ghosts, Hansi Flick’s team came to the Santiago Bernabéu and scored four more. Robert Lewandowski, a new man now, scored twice; Lamine Yamal became the youngest player ever to score in this fixture; and Raphinha lifted in the last, history written.</p><p>The risk Barcelona supposedly ran was the one that undid Madrid, not them. Carlo Ancelotti’s team were sliced apart, stripped naked at the Bernabéu by a team that started with six players under 21 in the side. “There are games in Germany they call the clásico but it’s not the same,” Flick had said, and he was right. But eve

They went toe-to-toe with Saracens, who have set the pace so far in the Premiership this season, and displayed the trademark stubbornness of any Cheika side by the bucketload to clinch a first win here in six-and-a-half years.</p><p>They scored four tries – so too did Saracens – and if the hosts were missing seven players who were away with England, the Tigers themselves were without five for the same reason. It made for an enthralling, frenetic encounter, shorn of star English names, but high on thrills and spills. For Leicester, the Australian centre Izaia Perese was outstanding and the collective effort from the forwards will have had Cheika purring. For the hosts, Tom Willis has somehow upped his efforts after his England snub. He did

## Matheus Cunha claws back late point for Wolves in comeback at Brighton

<p>Gary O’Neil’s Wolves have rarely been faulted for a lack of effort. To play well and still lose is not a positive sign, despite myriad hard-luck stories. While their manager’s piercing blue eyes may regularly blaze with a sense of injustice at officialdom and VAR, individual mistakes, star players sold in the summer and lapses of concentration pile up. Here, at last, the hard work, the flashes of quality paid off. Wolves fought to the end when all seemed lost, mounting a thrilling two-goal comeback capped by Matheus Cunha’s last-second equaliser.</p><p>Danny Welbeck’s 45th-minute goal had undone Wolves’ solid first-half efforts, while in the second half, the quality of the visitors’ finishing let them down before Evan Ferguson’s first goal of the season put Brighton two up.

<p>Is Ipswich Town’s Premier League return doomed? For the most glorious period, it briefly promised to be everything they had hoped for. Two goals ahead, with their fans revelling in what looked set to be a triumphant trip to the Big Smoke, the visitors could start picturing the reality of a first top-flight win since April 2002.</p><p>The bubble rapidly burst when Brentford took a 3-2 lead and Harry Clarke was sent off, only for Liam Delap to grab the unlikeliest of late equalisers. And then it all fell apart at the death.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/26/brentford-ipswich-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Failure to contain the conflict has led to huge suffering and geopolitical shifts. Why didn’t the US commit to Nato?</p><p>Reflecting the instincts of a cold war veteran, Joe Biden’s strategy was familiar: contain the conflict. When the US president spoke in Warsaw in March 2022, a month after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, he drew a red line at Vladimir Putin’s toes. “<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2022/03/26/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-united-efforts-of-the-free-world-to-support-the-people-of-ukraine/">Don’t even think about moving on one single inch of Nato territory</a>,” he&nbsp;warned.</p><p>The western allies would provide weapons and aid to Kyiv, impose sweeping economic and financial sanctions on Moscow and reduce the rouble to “rubble”, Biden vowed. Though not a Nato member, the US would help Ukraine win this symbolic battle for freedom and democracy. But it would not directly confront Russia unless Russia first attacke

<p>Australian Maratus spiders, which measure 3-5mm, are known as “peacock spiders” because of the extravagant colourings they display during courtship rituals and combat. Sydney-based artist <a href="https://mariafernandacardoso.com/">Maria Fernanda Cardoso</a> became fascinated with the tiny spiders, which she has depicted in the series <em>Spiders of Paradise</em>, in collaboration with the Museum of Contemporary Art Australia. Together with scientific imager Geoff Thompson and Queensland Museum entomologist Andy Wang, she created composite images of their distinctive patterns using more than 1,000 source photographs for each species. “They’re cute, they’re exclusively Australian,” says Cardoso of the spiders. “They’re incredibly expressive and very flirtatious. The male wants to get all the attention of the female, like birds of paradise.”</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.mca.com.au/exhibitions/maria-fernanda-cardoso-spiders-of-paradise/">Maria Fernanda Cardoso: Spiders of Paradise

It’s about the enduring bonds of a lifelong friendship, the celebration of memories and making peace with regrets. In Tilda Swinton and Julianne Moore, it boasts two of the finest actors currently working. It should be the kind of mascara-streaming weepy that tears out your heart and stomps it into tiny, aching fragments.

The former accountant from Barnsley has been out of work since the pandemic, but has found jobhunting tough amid a battle with the depression and anxiety she has faced since her teenage years.</p><p>“I’ve come out of a 30-year marriage. I got my first sicknote at the age of 57, first time unemployed. And everything went down hill from there,” she says, wringing her hands under the table in a dimly lit room at the town’s adult learning centre, alongside a dozen others in a similar position.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/oct/26/the-sickness-trap-how-barnsley-has-tried-to-fight-back-against-worklessness">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Enthusiasm can be a productive force for good, but our culture has rapidly become a fan-based landscape that the rest of us are merely living in</p><p>About a decade ago, I&nbsp;ventured my opinion that the adult multitudes queueing for superhero movies were potentially an indicator of emotional arrest, which could have worrying political and social implications. Since at that time Brexit, Donald Trump and fascist populism hadn’t happened yet, my evidently crazy diatribe was largely met with outrage from the fan community, some of whom angrily demanded I be extradited to the US and made to stand&nbsp;trial for my crimes against superhumanity – which I felt didn’t necessarily disprove my allegations.</p><p>Ten years on, let me make my position clear: I believe that fandom is&nbsp;a wonderful and vital organ of contemporary culture, without which that culture ultimately stagnates, atrophies and dies. At the same time, I’m sure that fandom is sometimes a&nbsp;grotesque blight that po

<p><strong>North Hertfordshire: </strong>I’m always pleased when ivy mining bees arrive in our garden and create mini volcanoes of dirt. I also don’t mind when they go again</p><p>My garden has got some unlikely invaders. They appeared out of the ground like magic and have completely changed my lawn from flat green grass to being full of grey miniature volcanoes of dirt.</p><p>But these invaders are actually friendly and do good for the environment. These mysterious animals are mining bees. Mining bees <a href="https://www.woodlandtrust.org.uk/blog/2023/07/types-of-bee-in-the-uk/">are not your everyday bees</a>, as instead of living in beehives they dig individual holes and live in them&nbsp;alone. If you have them in your garden, you might be a bit worried with loads of bees buzzing around, but unlike normal bees they don’t sting. Which is great because that means I can get really, really close to them.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/oct/26/young-country-d

<p>Poor discipline is only one issue Mikel Arteta is grappling with before Sunday’s key date with Arne Slot’s leaders</p><p>If Mikel Arteta needs solace regarding his team’s poor disciplinary record this season the Arsenal manager could look back to the Arsène Wenger era. The Frenchman – who celebrated his 75th birthday this week – is remembered for his revolutionary approach to fitness and player nutrition that spelled the end for the infamous Tuesday drinking club. Yet each of the three Premier League titles he won featured at least three Arsenal red cards as they retained the fighting spirit associated with George Graham’s championship winning&nbsp;sides.</p><p>When Martin Keown was sent off against Derby on 29 September 2001 for two yellow cards – the first, Declan Rice take note, for “preventing a quick free-kick” – he was the third Arsenal player dismissed only seven matches into the league campaign.

<p>England are thriving at youth level but governing body has been urged to act to save rugby from irrelevance elsewhere</p><p>The damning report on schools rugby released by the Rugby Football Union this week leaves little open to interpretation. The verdict is unequivocal, the warning stark: act now or the sport will drift into irrelevance. Whatever you think about the non-contact or reduced contact initiatives aimed at tackling the issue, at least the RFU has admitted it has a problem.</p><p>It is a societal problem as much as anything else. Parents are being turned off rugby in a more risk-averse atmosphere where football is king. Rugby is complicated, seen as dangerous, it can be perceived as a sport for “posh white boys”, according to the report, and is a foreign concept in most state schools.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/26/rugby-union-elite-pathway-rfu-premiership">Continue reading...</a>
