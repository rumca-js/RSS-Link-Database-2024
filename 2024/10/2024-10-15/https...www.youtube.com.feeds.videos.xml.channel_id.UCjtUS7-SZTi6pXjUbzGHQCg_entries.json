A coating that could someday transform objects into miniature solar panels, a memory alloy that can shift panels into different shapes, and a dye that can transmute a solar panel into\u2026a slightly better-performing solar panel. As Solar's deployment and commercialization continues to rapidly progress, it\u2019s still fun to take a moment to stop and stare at the weird little things scientists are discovering along the way. What\u2019s the story behind these experiments? And can anything practical actually come out of them?\n\nKorea Electrotechnology Research Institute (they have amazing videos on their channel \u2026 check them out): https://www.youtube.com/@keriliveon  \n\nWatch The Weird Science Behind Living Solar Panels https://youtu.be/v8jsWkU6HdI", "id": 1327385, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAFzRFth1lE", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 453, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCjtUS7-SZTi6pXjUbzGHQCg", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/XAFzRFth1lE/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "The Crazy Science of Three Dimensional Solar \u2026 and More", "vote": 0}]
