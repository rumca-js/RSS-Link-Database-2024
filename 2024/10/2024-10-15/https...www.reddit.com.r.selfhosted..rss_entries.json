A couple of years ago I posted about my &quot;Share to Mealie&quot; app on Android, requesting alpha testers and got useful feedback.</p> <p>I&#39;m back again with the same request for the &quot;Pro&quot; version (paid) of the app, which supports taking images and sending them to your Mealie instance (requires that you have setup Open AI with a recent version of the server).</p> <p>The app adds a &quot;share target&quot; for multiple images, so you can send photos of your multi page recipes. Alternatively you can take pictures from the app directly. Your device will stitch them together into a single image and send them to your Mealie instance for parsing. <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.coffeeteers.sharetomealie&amp;hl=en_US&amp;pli=1\">+ everything in the free app.</a></p> <p>So, if you&#39;re down to ", "id": 1325416, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1g3zy4y/share_to_mealie_android_app_call_for_alpha", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 450, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "\"Share to Mealie\" Android App - Call for alpha testers for Pro version (paid, free for testers) which supports sharing/taking photos", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-10-15T03:56:00+00:00", "description": "<table> <tr><td> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1g3z3n7/recently_got_into_selfhosting_thought_i_would/\"> <img src=\"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/56G7BCBvSBbro2nnUHTLXKfDDTn3ll0XWZJ7Zoal1Po.jpg\" alt=\"Recently got into selfhosting, thought I would share my Homepage setup.\" title=\"Recently got into selfhosting, thought I would share my Homepage setup.\" /> </a> </td><td> <!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/4zarrg5jduud1.png?width=2880&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=44e5b5f0fa96215e29fcef345fb8d41d1ee08894\">my homepage with several services and widgets</a></p> <p>~Yes, those are cameras to spy on our cats when we are not home. </p> <p>I recently discovered Homepage after FINALLY getting my plex setup to work and I have really taken a liking to it.<br/> After spending too long fiddling with everything I could get my hands on I am quite happy with the setup I have so I thought I would show it off and share it.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON ", "id": 1325218, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1g3z3n7/recently_got_into_selfhosting_thought_i_would", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 450, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/56G7BCBvSBbro2nnUHTLXKfDDTn3ll0XWZJ7Zoal1Po.jpg", "title": "Recently got into selfhosting, thought I would share my Homepage setup.", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-10-15T03:44:24+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p><a href=\"https://github.com/ImPot8o/e2ee-chat-room\">https://github.com/ImPot8o/e2ee-chat-room</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://chat.pot8o.dev\">https://chat.pot8o.dev</a></p> <p>It gives a default encryption key for more casual users.

I want to get a NAS server (on a budget since I&#39;m a student), where I can store all my photos, videos, university documents, emails etc. I&#39;m currently fed up with paying these shitty cloud services, so I thought I could take the matter on my own hands. I&#39;ve been searching the internet for a few days now, and I&#39;ve seen that these servers can indeed get really expensive, considering the server itself and the storage and so on. From my local craigslist, I found a guy who&#39;s selling his Synology DS413j for 10 Euros - would that be a good option if it&#39;s actually still running, or is it better to find a newer device since this one is around 11 years already?
