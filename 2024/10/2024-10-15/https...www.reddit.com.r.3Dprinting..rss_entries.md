This is the end result from print, to paint, to resin coating. (No sanding in this process.) I rushed myself for no good reason so it&#39;s a little sloppier than it had to be but for a first attempt I am happy enough with the outcome. The idea was to see how UV Resin would smooth out a print to avoid sanding it. I have added my first coated print as the last photo to show those who haven&#39;t seen what just coating a fresh print with UV resin does to it.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="

Makes the screws go in so much easier!<br/></li> <li>Name your sketches and bodies! This helps so much when you want to go back and change just one dimension. Saves you from hovering over the sketches in the timeline until you find the right one.<br/></li> <li>In Fusion, pressing &quot;s&quot; will bring up a search dialogue so you don&#39;t have to fumble through menus every time. </li> <li>You can rebind keyboard shortcuts for tools. i.e. if you use the centre rectangle more often, you can set that to be &quot;r&quot; by clicking the three dots next to the menu item.</li> <li>&quot;q&quot; brings up the offset faces dialogue, which makes it so easy to add some room for tolerance

So I decided to design my own using 3d printed shell with dowels inside of them to add rigidity. The shelfs are just your standard hardware store 12x1 planks. Project cost me about 2 rolls of petg filament, $20 dollars worth of dowels, $10 worth of screws, and 40 dollars worth of 1&quot;x12&quot;x10&#39; planks.</p> <p>Total project cost is is roughly $110.</p> <p>Pretty proud of this project!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/nguyeken"> /u/nguyeken </a> <br/> <s
