E.g.</li> </ol> <p><code> dtoverlay=miniuart-bt </code></p> <p>Hopefully this will save someone hours and days I spent figuring this out</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/vmpn"> /u/vmpn </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1g3zl6c/enable_bluetooth_for_rpi4_with_fedora_coreos/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1g3zl6c/enable_bluetooth_for_rpi4_with_fedora_coreos/">[comments]</a></span>
