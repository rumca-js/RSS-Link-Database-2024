<p>I like Instagram as much as the next guy. I check in daily on my <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3489971/are-you-the-boss-of-your-feed.html">carefully curated feed of folks I follow</a> and then work hard not to doomscroll the day away.</p>



<p>One of my favorite follows is an adorable Corgi (aren’t they all adorable?) named Parsnip. Every day Parsnip, whose owner is a friend of mine, has a mini-adventure that is described by a haiku. And every single day, to see that haiku, I have to click the dreaded “See more…” link. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3689973/what-is-generative-ai-artificial-intelligence-that-creates.html">Generative artificial intelligence</a> has grown extremely rapidly, attracting investment and sparking developer interest and creativity. Companies see generative AI as a route to building innovative services and revolutionizing their industries.</p>



<p>However, while developers are keen to build with generative AI, the challenge is how to move beyond initial tests into running at scale. They are now working through problems around how to integrate and manage their projects so that pilot schemes can move into production. This is a common experience in new technology projects as

<p>A <a href="https://www.tenable.com/cyber-exposure/tenable-cloud-risk-report-2024">report by cloud security company Tenable</a> discovered that 74% of companies surveyed had exposed storage or other misconfigurations. This is a dangerous open door to cybercriminals. Overall, <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3545268/why-cloud-security-outranks-cost-and-scalability.html">cloud security</a> is getting worse. The availability and quality of security tools is getting better, but the people confirming the cloud computing infrastructure are getting dumber. Something has to give.</p>



<p>The study also reveals that more than one-third of cloud environments are critically vulnerable due to a c
