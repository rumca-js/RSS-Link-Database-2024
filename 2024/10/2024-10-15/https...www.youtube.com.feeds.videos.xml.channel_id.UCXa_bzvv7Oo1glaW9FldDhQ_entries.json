It arguably reached new highs with Ys 8: Lacrimosa of Dana and Ys 9: Monstrum Nox, yet there was still hype for Ys 10: Nordics. Having shifted to Falcom's new engine and promising a larger scale, it seemed poised to elevate the series even higher.\n\nThe truth is a little more complicated. Set earlier in Adol's life, Ys 10: Nordics sees him teaming with Karja Balta to battle the Griegr. All the while, he must unravel the mystery of their plans and the Normans' history. Alongside sailing and ship combat, it also features a new combat system focused on parrying and dual attacks.\n\nIt's a lot, and while some mechanics can be enjoyable, I have my share of nitpicks. Don't get me wrong - Ys 10: Nordics is enjoyable, but longtime fans should know what they're getting into.", "id": 1330032, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JFPh_UwXXY", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 129, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/-JFPh_UwXXY/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Ys X: Nordics Review - The Final Verdict", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-10-15T15:30:28+00:00", "description": "Within this curated list, you\u2019ll find games from a multitude of genres and styles.
