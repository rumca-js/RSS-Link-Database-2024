A coating that could someday transform objects into miniature solar panels, a memory alloy that can shift panels into different shapes, and a dye that can transmute a solar panel into…a slightly better-performing solar panel. As Solar's deployment and commercialization continues to rapidly progress, it’s still fun to take a moment to stop and stare at the weird little things scientists are discovering along the way. What’s the story behind these experiments? And can anything practical actually come out of them?
