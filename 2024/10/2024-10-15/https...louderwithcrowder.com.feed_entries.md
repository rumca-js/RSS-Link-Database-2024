However, not wanting to be drafted is not grounds for asylum but being fearful of your life because of your sexual orientation is. So it’s likely he just forgot he was gay and that’s why his application was approved after disclosing that piece of information the second time around.</p

However, just because the intent was not there does not mean the woke mob won’t have a meltdown after being reminded that the KKK was a thing. </p><p>As you know, corporations often release holiday-themed merchandise, and it just so happens that not everyone is on the lookout for KKK-like hoods that are actually snowflakes. This is probably how Bath & Body Works released a candle, labeled “Snowed In”, which some argue is too close for comfort in terms of wh

And although nothing in life is fair, even cavemen knew this was the justified way to go about things. However, one day progressives woke up and demanded an end to girls’ sports based on the premise that someone can feel some type of way despite biological reality. </p>
<p>Given the fact that ambiguous feelings don’t actually dictate anatomy, most people are not gaslighted into “affirming” their way in the pursuit of ending girls’ sports. So while the left pretends abortion is the most important social issue for females right now, they are actively working to end the rights of females everywhere. However, given how asinine this is, many people won’t stand up for this injustice. </p>
