Violence and passion intertwine endlessly in the works of the late social documentary photographer who chronicled one of her native Sicily’s deadliest periods. Battaglia – whose name translates as “battle” – fought for her place to be Palermo’s eye witness. She was often the only woman at the scene, as her pictures reveal, up close to her subjects – dead or alive. When she returned to her home city in 1974, it was to a frenzy of bloodshed, as two pitiless new mafia bosses took leadership of the Corleonesi clan. Thousands were murdered in the ensuing years. Battaglia moved through the wake of the violence with her camera.</p><p>Walking through the first room of Battalgia’s exhibition,

<p>A joyriding teenager drives headlong into the zombie apocalypse in David Moreau’s euphorically nihilistic film</p><p>You’re young, you’re high, you’re carefree, you’re tooling around in daddy’s best car … when a heavily bandaged and bleeding young woman jumps into your borrowed ride, unable to speak and in a state of panicked frenzy. What do you do? Teenager Romain (Milton Riche) panics right back at her, and so begins a fantastic exercise in tension and mood, with director David Moreau (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/jan/26/worldcinema.horror">Them</a>) maintaining a strong sense of momentum even as the film skates by on the loosest of narratives.</p><p>This sense of momentum is aided by the choice to shoot the film in one take. Or rather, the appearance of one take; inevitably there are joins but, as with Hitchcock’s Rope, they are hidden as much as possible. It does not take too long to become apparent that some sort of viral outbreak is afoot, perhaps a relative

Power is entertainment,” proclaims wannabe world saviour Dark Might (voiced by Kenta Miyake) in this fourth film spin-off from the daffy Japanese X-Men knock-off.

Today’s players may not be overly familiar with Kevin Bowring, the first professional head coach of Wales between 1995-98, or Ronnie Dawson, who led the British &amp; Irish Lions to a famous win against the All Blacks in 1959 and later became Ireland’s first national coach, but both helped to change their sport for the better.</p><p>Dawson, among myriad other roles, was a member of the committee that organised the transformative first Rugby World Cup while Bowring was a brilliant mentor to many of modern rugby’s most thoughtful coaches and educators from Stuart Lancaster and Shaun Edwards to Ben Ryan and Toby Booth.

That’s no mean feat given the core plot is about a troupe of middle-aged male strippers who fall into a trap laid by a coven determined to raise a 16th-century witch from the dead. To complete this project, penises must be severed – a prospect our heroes aren’t keen on, for obvious reasons. You can imagine the elevator pitch: The Full Monty meets Necromancy, or some such.</p><p>The leader of the strippers, who go by the handle Wet Dreams, is feckless, fiftysomething Alan (Dean Kilbey), a terminal screw-up living in a rented room in a student flat and making money on the side as a camboy.

## What I Ate in One Year by Stanley Tucci review – one bite too many?

<p>The Hollywood star’s fourth food book starts well enough but quickly descends into bland anecdote, leaving his endearing charm and wit to season an empty plate</p><p>I must admit that I was slightly surprised by the appearance of Stanley Tucci’s latest book. If I were to write on such a theme, the result would be the size of Samuel Richardson’s <em>Clarissa</em> or a Victorian family Bible, fit only to be wheeled around on a small trolley. His effort, though, has an outwardly quite sensible girth, and when you open it, white space abounds. Add to this the advisory subtitle “And Related Thoughts” (ah, so there’s some general pontificating involved, as well as musings on breakfast, lunch and dinner) and, even before you start reading, the buffet is beginning to seem a touch decimated.</p><p><em>What I Ate in One Year</em> takes the form of a diary. When it opens in January 2023, Tucci, a Golden Globe and Emmy-winning actor, has just arrived in Rome to film <em><a href="https://www.th

But when we check in to the Roseate Villa – a 15-minute trundle from the station – and the man who greets us asks for our car registration, I get a virtuous glow from saying we’ve come by train (causing less than a third of the carbon emissions as well as less congestion in the Georgian city, though I don’t point that out).</p><p>This is our first stop on a wholly car-free foodie tour arranged through Sawday’s and sustainable travel platform Byway.

<p>The emphasis is on the psychological in Joshua Morgan’s ambitious debut feature of family dysfunction, but it just doesn’t come together</p><p>In the prologue to Joshua Morgan’s debut feature, a mother and daughter are shown cowering in fear while a drunken man’s voice berates them. This is the background context for a surreal psychological horror with the emphasis firmly on the psychological over the horror. Cut to the present day and, in a 10-minute scene set in a therapist’s office, Kathy (Danielle J Bowman) is seeking help to mend her broken family. The grey-haired eminence sitting opposite her is reassuring. She has seen it all before. She refers to a difficult case much like Kathy’s, which her strategies helped to resolve to the satisfaction of all. You can see on Kathy’s face how desperately she wants to buy what the therapist is selling her. She needs to believe it will be OK, if she will just trust the process. “It all starts with a leap of faith,” the therapist says gentl

The high-speed line from central London (ish) to the north of England, has for a decade been rightly derided as an outrageously expensive endeavour that has already failed in its most basic aim of levelling up England. But while the betrayal of the north of England over HS2 has been well documented, chances are you don’t know this: Wales has been betrayed just as much as the disappointed regions of England, if not more.</p><p>I don’t blame you for not being aware of the Great Welsh Train Robbery.

Mulled wine is a drink that is tied to a specific moment. It’s not enough for the weather to be cold, grey and rainy (god knows we experience that often enough in the UK), it needs to feel <em>festive</em> –<em><strong> </strong></em>preferably in the presence of at least one adult dressed as an elf.</p><p>In my head, mulled wine is a sort of goth sangria, a concoction that is flavoured, sweetened and spiced into something else entirely. This is also why people who don’t think of themselves as wine drinkers tend to enjoy mulled wine and sangria. It is stripped of expectation, of denomination and circumstance. It’s just plain fun.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/oct/15/mulled-white-wine-perfect-for-christmas-guzzling
