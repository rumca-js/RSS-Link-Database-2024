Maybe even 2 or three years.</p> <p>I think the game has many modes with various difficulties but I believe it is meant to be cooperative.</p> <p>The cover of the game prices and the box are predominantly grey. I think it&#39;s a similar grey (maybe a bit darker) to Tokyo highway. It also might have a similar matte feel.</p> <p>I feel like the pieces are mostly grey but some are a deep blue, a black and maybe even a yellow.</p> <p>The shapes are triangles and cylinders. I think many of the shapes are made of foam.</p> <p>That&#39;s all I have. I played it at Pax, they have it in their game library.</p> <p>The game wants you to look at the cards to make a 3D structure with the shapes. The cards you get show you a 2D view from various ang

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>People get into board game design for a number of reasons - the urge to create, a desire to share their love of gaming with the world, or even just to make some cash. However I think I have the noblest of all reasons - to put right a terrible injustice in the world of boardgaming.</p> <p>Huddersfield, my home town, has many things going for it. For example - it is the birthplace of Sir Patrick Stewart, the location of the longest running sit-com in the world, and the maker of the world&#39;s biggest pie. However, unlike lesser locations like London, Tokyo, or New York, there are almost no board games themed around the area.</p> <p>That is until I burst onto the game design scene however! Not only did I set my 2021 game CoraQuest in Hoodezfield (which, as we all know, is the ancient Dwarven name for Huddersfield), but I’m also making sure that the town is featured prominently in the game I’ve designed with Mike DiLisio - <a href="https://www.kickstarte

I paid $19 for the game and would prefer to not pay that much, or more, to replace them. Is there any source to buy a suitable replacement at a price that doesn&#39;t exceed my original investment?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Okay this isn&#39;t that deep, mostly just funny.</p> <p>I got my girlfriend into board games about a year ago. I have about 300 games. I used to back a few KS&#39;s per year and definitely was on the hype train for a bunch of others, but I have learned from my experience that it&#39;s never actually worth it either financially or time-wise (we can argue about this in another thread, or I have a complete analysis on BGG lol). I haven&#39;t backed a KS in almost 2 years.</p> <p>Still, I understand the FOMO and how fun it is to get wrapped up in a campaign. Well she finally found one (on her own) to get obsessed with and...she went all in. All-in on an extremely simple game that will literally sell for $15-20 on the used market once it&#39;s out. It&#39;s a super unimpressive game.</p> <p>She got pulled in by the player mats, miniatures, acrylic standees, etc... I&#39;ve been there, but always with much more complex games that will keep a higher resale
