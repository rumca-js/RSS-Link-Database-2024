<p>Semiconductor rivals Intel and AMD announced the formation of an x86-processor advisory group that will try to address ever-increasing AI workloads, custom chiplets, and advances in 3D packaging and system architectures.</p>



<p>Members of the x86 Ecosystem Advisory Group include Broadcom, Dell, Google, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, HP, Lenovo, Meta, Microsoft, Oracle, and Red Hat. Notably missing: TSMC — the world’s largest chipmaker. Linux creator Linus Torvalds and Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney are also members.</p>



<p>The mega-tech companies plan to collaborate on architectural interoperability and hope to “simplify software development” across the world’s most widely used computing architec

<p><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3544306/what-to-expect-from-apple-this-october-and-beyond.html">As expected</a>, Apple has introduced a much faster Apple Intelligence-capable iPad mini equipped with the same A17 Pro chip used in the iPhone 15 Pro series. That’s a good improvement from the A15 Bionic in the previous model, and makes for faster graphics, computation, and AI calculation. </p>



<p>It also sets the scene for the public release of the first Apple Intelligence features on Oct. 28, when I expect all of Apple’s heavily promoted wave of current hardware ads to  at last make more sense. (We can also expect new Macs before the end of October.)</p>

<p>Sebastien Bubeck, Microsoft’s vice president of GenAI research, is leaving the company to join OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT.</p>



<p>Bubeck, a 10-year veteran at Microsoft, played a significant role in driving the company’s <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2338115/what-is-generative-ai-artificial-intelligence-that-creates.html">generative AI</a> strategy, with a focus on designing more efficient small language models (SLMs) to rival OpenAI’s GPT systems.</p>



<p>His work culminated in the creation of the compact and cost-effective Phi models, which have since been incorporated into key Microsoft products like the Bing chatbot and Office 365 Copilot, gradually replacing OpenAI’s mod
