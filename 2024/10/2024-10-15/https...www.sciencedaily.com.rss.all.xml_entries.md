Researchers have discovered seven new species of tree frogs that make otherworldly calls in the rainforests of Madagascar. Their strange, high-pitched whistling calls sound more like sound effects from the sci-fi series Star Trek. As a result, the researchers have named the new species after seven of the series' most iconic captains.

The influence of climate change on migration, both current and future, has garnered significant attention from the public and policymakers over the past decade. A new study has provided the first comprehensive analysis of how climate factors -- specifically drought and aridity -- affect internal migration.

## New test improves diagnosis of allergies

Researchers have developed a test to simplify the diagnosis of allergies. Its effectiveness has now been confirmed in clinical samples from children and adolescents suffering from a peanut allergy. The results could fundamentally improve the clinical diagnosis of allergies in future.

## Older adults appear less emotionally affected by heat

When the outside temperatures rise, people tend to lose their cool. That connection is well known, but a new study found that emotional responses to heat are highly individualized and only one factor moderated it -- age. Overall, researchers found that the actual temperature at which the majority of people felt uncomfortable during a hot summer depended on the individual. When they did feel discomfort, it often negatively affected their mood. The exception: older adults on average became more uncomfortable in high heat more quickly, but it did not affect their mood as much as it did younger adults.

## Study uncovers how silkworm moth's odor detection may improve robotics

Researchers explore how the domesticated flightless silkworm moth (Bombyx mori), a prominent insect model in olfactory research, uses wing flapping to manipulate airflow, enhancing their ability to detect distant pheromones. These findings highlight how moths guide pheromones to their odor sensors in antennae, and suggest potential applications for designing advanced robotic systems for odor source localization. This could inspire future innovations in drones and provide design guidelines for robots to locate odor sources.

## Scientists discover chemical probes for previously 'undruggable' cancer target

Hormone-driven cancers, like those of the breast and prostate, often rely on a tricky-to-target protein called Forkhead box protein 1 (FOXA1). FOXA1 mutations can enable these types of cancers to grow and proliferate. Today, FOXA1 is notoriously difficult to block with drugs -- but that may soon change. Scientists have identified a crucial binding site on FOXA1 that could pave the way for future cancer treatments. The team's findings also mapped out how tiny drug-like chemical compounds -- called small molecules -- interact with the protein.

## Arthropods dominate plant litter decomposition in drylands

An analysis of leaf litter breakdown in climatically diverse habitats shows that decomposition by larger invertebrates dominates in hot, dry regions and warmer seasons. Researchers have shown that larger insects such as woodlice and beetles play as much of a crucial role in leaf litter decomposition across different habitats and seasons as microbes and smaller invertebrates.

## Alzheimer's disease may damage the brain in two phases

Alzheimer's disease may damage the brain in two distinct phases, based on new research using sophisticated brain mapping tools. According to researchers who discovered this new view, the first, early phase happens slowly and silently -- before people experience memory problems -- harming just a few vulnerable cell types. In contrast, the second, late phase causes damage that is more widely destructive and coincides with the appearance of symptoms and the rapid accumulation of plaques, tangles, and other Alzheimer's hallmarks.

## Immune signatures may predict adverse events from immunotherapy

Distinct immune 'signatures' in patients who develop adverse events while taking immunotherapy for cancer may help oncologists identify patients at risk and treat them early to prevent serious side effects, suggests a new study.
