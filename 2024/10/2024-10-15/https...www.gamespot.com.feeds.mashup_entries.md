<p dir="ltr">Mortal Kombat 1's time-twisting campaign ended on a high note, as the introduction of various timelines signaled a wealth of opportunities for future installments. Khaos Reigns is the first DLC expansion on the story, in which a Titan version of the anarchic villain Havik tries to throw Liu Kang's version of the world into his own brand of chaos. The only chaotic force at play here, though, is the storytelling, as this expansion is plagued by rushed story beats and a boring, monotonous structure.</p><p dir="ltr">Khaos Reigns features five chapters--one-third the number in the main campaign--with three of those focusing on the three new roster additions: Cyrax, Sektor, and Noob Saibot. The two chapters between Sektor and Noob follow two main roster characters, Rain and Tanya--albeit in new Emperor and Empress variants, respectively.</p><p dir="ltr">Every one of these chapters plays out the same way: A cutscene eventually bleeds into a pre-fight dialogue, then the fight hap

<p>According to multiple sources, Call of Duty: Warzone could have had a crossover bundle with Halo. Social media user The Ghost Of Hope, who has accurately revealed unannounced Call of Duty information many times in the past, discussed this recently on X.</p><p>"Kinda crazy how a Halo x COD Master Chief collab was actually scrapped for MWIII for completely unknown reasons," the person said. CharlieIntel, one of the most popular and respected Call of Duty information sources, <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1845961027940200614">backed up the report</a>, saying it heard the same thing.</p><p>The Ghost of Hope shared an image, too, but it's unclear if this is only a mock-up. In any event, it's likely any Halo x COD crossover bundle would have featured popular Halo stuff like Master Chief himself, along with popular weapons like the Energy Sword and Halo's iconic assault rifle.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-almost-had-a-halo-crossover-bundle-report

And though I can't talk about my impressions just yet, I can share a conversation I had with Striking Distance studio head Steve Papoutsis and creative director Ben Walker after playing the game.

All the designs feature contributions from the Lies of P team, and they reference events from the game, some of the graffiti found in the streets, and P's powerful arm prosthetics. For something a little smaller and more subtle, Lies of P fans can look forward to a pin that replicates the design of Monad's Lamp in 2025.</p><h3>Lies of P hoodies</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src=

<p>When Fox put the first X-Men movie together, producers looked at the pages of the comics and worried about whether moviegoers would be put off by the silly clowns dancing around on the pages even as they salivated at the potential profits those silly clowns promised. They took inspiration from The Matrix, <a href="https://x.com/DiscussingFilm/status/1814699886350074273">according to Kevin Feige</a>, and instead put the team in black leather--and then wrote in a joke about yellow spandex just to remind us what a bunch of dummies we are for liking the source material, comic books.</p><p>Nearly a quarter of a century later, Marvel Studios has changed the conversation, giving us great-looking, faithful reproductions of characters like Wolverine, Ant-Man, Captain Marvel, and Spider-Man among many others.

<p dir="ltr">After a significant post-GameCube slump, the Mario Party franchise showed signs of new life in its first two titles on the Switch. While both Super Mario Party and Mario Party Superstars were commercial successes and well-received by fans, the former leaned a bit too heavily on a new Ally system while the latter was essentially a "greatest hits" of classic maps and minigames. As the console approaches the end of its lifecycle, Super Mario Party Jamboree ends this Switch trilogy by attempting to find the sweet spot between its two predecessors and stumbles into an issue of quantity over quality in the process.</p><p dir="ltr">One aspect that Jamboree inarguably has going for it is sheer quantity. Nintendo touts this entry as having the most playable characters (22) and most minigames (112) in any Mario Party ever. A big roster isn't necessarily a bad thing, although I have one nitpicky complaint about Bowser's inclusion. I've got no beef with the man—he's been a playable m

<p>Disney World's popular Big Thunder Mountain Railroad ride will temporarily close this coming January, and the attraction won't open again until 2026. The extended closure for the Magic Kingdom ride is due to "refurbishment," Disney said in a <a href="https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/attractions/magic-kingdom/big-thunder-mountain-railroad/">statement on its website. </a></p><p>Specifically, Big Thunder Mountain Railroad at Disney World will temporarily close on January 6, 2025, making January 5 the final day to ride it before it shutters for an entire year. Disney said it will re-open with "a little bit of new magic" in 2026. That's all Disney had to say on the matter, but many are wondering and theorizing about why the ride is closing for an entire year.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4384232-screenshot2024-10-15at8.45.50am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4384232" data-ratio="0.55661375661376" data-wi
