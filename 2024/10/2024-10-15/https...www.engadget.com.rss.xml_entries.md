<p>The dog-esque robots created by the likes of Boston Dynamics and MAB Robotics are already horrifying thanks to a mix of the “Metalhead” episode of <em>Black Mirror </em>and humanity’s natural apprehension for an uncertain future.

<p>The move to Tesla’s grid of Superchargers will expand Nissan’s charging network to 90,000 stations across the US. Nissan’s energy network also includes the Shell Recharge, ChargePoint and EVgo networks with plans to expand other networks as well.

<p>The optional feature, called “activity status,” will display a green bubble alongside someone’s profile photo when they’re online.

<p>Riot Games is cutting jobs from its <em>League of Legends</em> team. Marc Merrill, the studio's co-founder, co-chairman and chief product officer, announced the cuts today <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://x.com/MarcMerrill/status/1846243708100091985" data-original-link="https://x.com/MarcMerrill/status/1846243708100091985">on X</a>. "This isn’t about reducing headcount to save money—it’s about making sure we have the right expertise so that League continues to be great for another 15 years and beyond," Merrill said. A rep from Riot Games told Engadget that 32 jobs will be eliminated across the company in this move.</p>
<p>The spin seems to be that the developer is trying to reprioritize behind the scenes, especially with Merrill's insistence that "we’re not slowing down work on the game you love" and that the team "will eventually be even larger than it is today as we develop the next phase of League." He didn'

<p>The Nuio Flow is a new ergonomic keyboard and accessory system for those who don’t mind trading serious cash for a sleek and thoughtful design. Co-founded by two brothers, one of whom is a former Apple designer, Nuio has an Apple-like value proposition: a split keyboard and an optional trackpad, desk pad, magnetic stands and wristpads for $400 for the keyboard alone to over $1,000 for all of components.</p>
<p>At the center of Nuio’s product lineup is the Flow split ergonomic keyboard, which (here’s the Apple influence again) “puts the human form at the center of every design.” Nuio CEO Tom Wilson says the product’s purpose is to reject legacy decisions that often dictate keyboard design. “There are literally no right angles in the human body,” Wilson wrote in a press release shared with Engadget. “Yet we spend most of our lives hunched over rigid, rectangular keyboards and peripherals — often enduring hours of wrist pain, tech fatigue and poor posture.”</p>

This new vehicle will reportedly have a starting price between $14,000 and $21,000 (though there’s no word about US availability yet). This marks Chinese automaker Leapmotor’s latest foray into markets outside China, and it looks like this EV could sell well globally due to its lower price tag.</p>

<p>YouTube <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/youtube-features-and-updates-2024/">just announced around two-dozen</a> tweaks and updates to the mobile app, the web player and the TV app. Many of these updates are on the insignificant side, so let’s go over the ones that are likely to change how people use the service.</p>

<p>Speed adjustments are getting much more granular. There will now be fine-tunable playback speed, with adjustments in 0.05 increments. Prior to this change, adjustment options were locked into 0.25 increments. True story. I watched YouTube exclusively at 0.75 speed for like two years and now whenever people talk at a normal speed I feel completely overwhelmed. Good times!</p>

<p>Today, Instagram announced that it will let users set up “profile cards,” a new way to help standard users and creators alike to “make new friends on Instagram.” Profile cards will have two sides and may include objects like your profile pictures, links to your sites, music or a QR code for others to scan. The card background can also be an image you like.</p>

<p>Meta’s latest play to get you into VR is a cheaper VR headset almost as capable as the $500 Quest 3. The <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://engadget.com/ar-vr/meta-quest-3s-review-impressive-vr-for-300-130013596.html"><ins>Quest 3S</ins></a> brings some but not all of the top features of the more expensive headset. Compared to the Quest 2, it has a more capable processor, better hand and controller tracking and lets you dip your toes into mixed reality.</p>
<p>Costs have been cut: There are lower-res screens and cheaper Fresnel lenses, but Meta has cleverly cherry picked the right specs to ensure the Quest 3S feels as capable as the more expensive option. You get the same subtle, comfortable controllers and the camera arrays to track your environment.</p>
<p>You can also use the 3S to play Xbox titles and even connect to your PC for VR games like<em> Half Life: Alyx. </em>The Quest 3S starts at $300 with 128GB of storage. If you’re intrigued, check out our <a data-i13n="cpos
