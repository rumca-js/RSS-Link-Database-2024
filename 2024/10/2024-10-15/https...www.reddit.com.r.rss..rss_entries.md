<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello,</p> <p>I&#39;m thinking of trying to swap some of my scrolling and such to RSS, but I feel like I don&#39;t totally understand RSS.

But it&#39;s a very expensive option and I cannot afford it.<br/> Could any of you suggest methods I can convert the website links I have to RSS type links? </p> <p>An example of website I want to convert is: <a href="https://www.orfonline.org/content-type/issue-briefs">ORF (orfonline.org)</a> </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Budget-Injury-2163"> /u/Budget-Injury-2163 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1g3up91/convert_website_to_rss_link/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com
