VOID ADMIRAL is a miniature-agnostic game of Space Warfare in a dark future. Pick from a wide selection of factions, each with their own Command Board and customizable ships, to dust off your starship collection. Written by fellow-Canadian Paul Bantock, VOID ADMIRAL blasts into the darkness to bring new life to old collections of grimdark spaceships.
