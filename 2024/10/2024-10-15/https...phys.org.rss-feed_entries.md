Viruses that infect bacteria—known as bacteriophages—could be used in a targeted manner to combat bacterial diseases. They also play an important ecological role in global biogeochemical cycles. Recent research by researchers at the University of Kaiserslautern-Landau (RPTU) has identified a previously unknown auxiliary metabolic gene in aquatic phages, thereby significantly expanding the previous understanding of these bacterial predators.

Future fusion power plants will require good plasma confinement to sustain reactions and generate energy. One way to contain plasma for fusion reactions is to use a tokamak, a device that applies magnetic fields to "bottle" plasma. However, magnetic islands, a type of instability in the plasma, can destroy the confining magnetic field if they grow large enough.

Metasurface technology is an advanced optical technology that is thinner, lighter, and more capable of precisely controlling light through nanometer-sized artificial structures than conventional technologies. KAIST researchers have overcome the limitations of existing metasurface technologies and successfully designed a Janus metasurface capable of perfectly controlling asymmetric light transmission. By applying this technology, they have also proposed an innovative method to significantly enhance security by only decoding information under specific conditions.

The increasing global demand for plant-based foods makes the use of pesticides necessary in order to protect crops from pests and ensure crop yields. However, there is one major disadvantage: the widespread use of pesticides has led to a considerable reduction in insect populations in the past. The decline in wild bees, which make a significant contribution to pollination and are therefore essential for agricultural yields, is particularly worrying.

As the world's native bee populations are declining, crop production requiring pollinators increasingly relies on commercial pollination services. In the U.S., the beekeeping industry is in great demand, and truckloads of bee colonies travel the country to accommodate crop growers. A new study from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign looks at pollination contracts between beekeepers and California almond growers, exploring clauses that could make the agreements more appealing for both parties.

Biological components are less reliable than electrical ones, and rather than instantaneously receive the incoming signals, the signals arrive with a variety of delays. This forces the brain to cope with said delays by having each neuron integrate the incoming signals over time and fire afterwards, as well as using a population of neurons, instead of one, to overcome neuronal cells that temporarily don't fire.

A study investigates the evolution of beneficial bacteria that live inside and on the surface of farming ants. Attine ants farm fungi, in one of the natural world's best-studied mutualistic symbioses. In the 1990s, the picture of this mutualism was expanded to include another partner: an actinobacteria, Pseudonocardia, which lives on the ants' cuticle—their hard exoskeleton—where its cultures are fed by secretions of subcuticular glands. Pseudonocardia is known to kill the fungal pathogen Escovopsis, which might destroy the ants' mutualistic fungus.

During embryonic development, cells start out as pluripotent, or have the potential to become many different cell types through differentiation. Naive-state is the name for the earliest stage of development for pluripotent stem cells and is considered totipotential, with the ability to become every kind of cell in a multicellular organism. The expression of a particular gene or set of genes is what determines what kind of cell―a skin cell, for example―a cell will become.
