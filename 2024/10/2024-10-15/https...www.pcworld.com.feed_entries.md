<p>For years, both AMD and Intel have energetically competed against one another in the PC processor market. But there’s a new force to be reckoned with — Arm — and both AMD and Intel are circling the wagons.</p>



<p>On Tuesday, both AMD and Intel, along with Linux creator Linus Torvalds, Epic CEO Tim Sweeney, Microsoft, and a number of other companies, announced the X86 Ecosystem Advisory Group. The goal is to allow AMD and Intel to keep competing, while unifying certain aspects of the X86 architecture where customers are demanding a simplified approach.</p>



<p>Part of competition involves different approaches to a specific problem, such as creating a processor using tiled chiplets or a monolithic design. In general, a software developer can code for the X86 instruction set that both AMD and Intel share and not have to worry too much about specific impl

<p>Last week, the <a href="https://archive.org" data-type="link" data-id="https://archive.org">Internet Archive</a> and its beloved Wayback Machine was taken down by a hacktivist group who unleashed a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack on the site. Along with that, data for over 31 million user accounts were lost in the cyberattack.</p>



<p>While the site owners have been working around the clock this past week to restore everything, it’s going to be a while longer before everything is back up and running as it was.</p>



<p>For now, though, there’s some good news: the Wayback Machine is up and running in a read-only capacity, meaning you can browse whatever it has archived so far but it won’t be archiving anything new for the time being. (The Wayback Machine is a renowned tool that archives copies of web pages so you can see those pages “as they

<p>Micron’s Crucial division today launched what the company says will be the next stage in the evolution of the PC’s humble memory module: CUDIMMs for laptops and CSODIMMs for desktops. Both will be necessary to continue allowing PC memory speeds to scale even higher, especially when Intel’s Arrow Lake chip arrives.</p>



<p>The clocked unbuffered dual inline memory modules (CUDIMMs) and the clocked small-outline dual memory modules (CSODIMMs) include a small clock driver circuit directly on the module itself. Traditional dual-inline memory modules (DIMMs) use the CPU clock instead.</p>



<p>That’s been satisfactory, until now. Micron’s new modules allow the PC’s memory to reach 6,400 megatransfers per second, or 15 percent faster than a “traditional” DDR5 DIMM. Put another way, these new CUDIMMS and CSODIMMS can achieve DDR5-6400 speeds.  According to JED

<p>Who has time to sit around and wait for devices to charge? No one. Certainly not these days. And that’s why <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Charger-Compact-Foldable-MacBook/dp/B09C5RG6KV/">this Anker Nano 65W USB-C wall plug is a must-buy</a> — especially now that it’s down to $30 on Amazon, a whopping 46 percent discount off its $56 MSRP.</p>



<p>This 3-port charger features two USB-C ports and one USB-A port. If you’re only charging one device at a time, either USB-C port can deliver a maximum output of 65W while the USB-A port goes up to 22.5W. With three devices at once, though, you can get 40W from the main USB-C port and 12W from the second USB-C and USB-A port each.</p>



<p>A throughput of 65W is no laughing matter. That’s fast enough for modern phones <em>and</em> laptops, and it’s even able to recharge a MacBook Pro at full speed. When y

<p>Humans are terrible at passwords. Simply put, most people can’t be bothered to create the sort of unique and complex words and phrases that make a good password, or if they do, they can’t be bothered to remember it, or they carelessly share it with others. How ironic that the thing that can ensure our online security has become our biggest obstacle to it. </p>



<p>Of course, a password manager is an antidote to our human failings. And before you start formulating reasons not to use a password manager, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/709052/6-common-reasons-people-dont-use-a-password-manager-and-why-theyre-wrong.html" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.pcworld.com/article/709052/6-common-reasons-people-dont-use-a-password-manager-and-why-theyre-wrong.html">here is why you’re wrong</a>.</p>

<p>As the proliferation of smart home devices continues, users are growing increasingly worried about manufacturers who are collecting data and effectively spying on their in-home behaviors. It’s been a big topic of concern for many years with smartphones that are always in our pockets and purses, but the risk is no longer limited to just that.</p>

<p>Gaming handhelds are the hottest form factor on the block right now. It seems like every manufacturer is eager to get a Windows-powered alternative to the Steam Deck in their catalog… whether or not Windows 11 is actually a good fit for these low-power game machines.</p>



<p>And it appears Microsoft has taken notice. The latest Windows Insider build has a new “gamepad keyboard” feature that makes text input much faster on these portable gaming devices.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading toc" id="what-is-webp">What is WebP?</h2>



<p>Anyone trying to save images from websites these days is increasingly stumbling across the new WebP image format. But what is it actually?</p>



<p>WebP was developed by Google to replace the outdated JPG, PNG, and GIF formats and is said to be technically superior to all three.</p>



<p>The format supports both lossless and lossy compression. </p>



<p>With lossless compression, the original image quality is retained, while lossy compression enables an even smaller file size at the expense of image quality.  </p>



<p>WebP can also handle transparency<strong> </strong>(alpha channel) in a similar way to PNGs. Animations from several images, as known from GIFs, are also possible.</p>
