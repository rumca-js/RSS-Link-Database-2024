First things first, I am not a tech savvy person at all, so you will have to dump it down for me.<br/> I currently use an app called &#39;Readwise Reader&#39; as my RSS feed app. In order to add websites to it I have to convert website links to RSS type links.<br/> I tried using <a href=\"https://rss.app/\">RSS Feed Generator, Create RSS feeds from URL</a> and it worked.
