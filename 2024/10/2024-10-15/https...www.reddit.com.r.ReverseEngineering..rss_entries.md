<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello Guys, i own a Heavn One lamp. It is controlled by BLE using the HEAVN App:</p> <p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/de/app/heavn-intelligente-beleuchtung/id1324699951">https://apps.apple.com/de/app/heavn-intelligente-beleuchtung/id1324699951</a></p> <p>Now i would like to find out the BLE Commands in order to create a Script for my Mac that sets the lamp to videoconference mode whenever i do a Teams call.</p> <p>What i tried before: I downloaded the Heavn App to my Mac and investigated what happens at the Bluetooth connection when pressing buttons in the app. Unfortunately i couldn’t find the used UART commands, but the UUID.</p> <p>How would you guys tackle this? Do you have a better and easier idea maybe? I don’t really want to buy nrf Bluetooth Sniffer Hardware, as i guess there might be an easier way.</p> <p>Thanks for your input.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/shmogen"> /u/shmogen </a> <
