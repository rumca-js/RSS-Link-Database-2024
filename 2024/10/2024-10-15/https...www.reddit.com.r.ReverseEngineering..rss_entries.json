It is controlled by BLE using the HEAVN App:</p> <p><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/heavn-intelligente-beleuchtung/id1324699951\">https://apps.apple.com/de/app/heavn-intelligente-beleuchtung/id1324699951</a></p> <p>Now i would like to find out the BLE Commands in order to create a Script for my Mac that sets the lamp to videoconference mode whenever i do a Teams call.</p> <p>What i tried before: I downloaded the Heavn App to my Mac and investigated what happens at the Bluetooth connection when pressing buttons in the app. Unfortunately i couldn\u2019t find the used UART commands, but the UUID.</p> <p>How would you guys tackle this? Do you have a better and easier idea maybe? I don\u2019t really want to buy nrf Bluetooth Sniffer Hardware, as i guess there might be an easier way.</p> <p>Thanks for your input.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/shmogen\"> /u/shmogen </a> <", "id": 1326269, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ReverseEngineering/comments/1g43d8j/reverseengineering_ble_commands_for_lamp", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 476, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ReverseEngineering/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "ReverseEngineering BLE Commands for Lamp", "vote": 0}]
