<p>This world-tilting Storyville documentary examines an industry dedicated to creating realistic avatars of loved ones, so the bereaved can communicate with them. It’s beautifully balanced – and highly alarming</p><p>All that work, all that talent, all that incredible brain and computing power, and it’s being concentrated on providing the world with nothing more than a higher, more powerfully terrible form of that old fortune teller’s skill, cold reading – extrapolating from a person’s tiniest behavioural clues to produce apparently unknowable information about them.</p><p>Eternal You is a 100-minute dive into the cold and murky waters of the digital afterlife industry.

<p>Clearly neither rapper had anything to do with this deep dive into their famous feud – and it makes for a refreshing alternative to hip-hop hagiography</p><p>The sky isn’t as blue, the grass not so green, food now tastes like sawdust and life just hasn’t been as sweet, since rap superstars Kendrick Lamar and Drake ceased their epic beefing back in May. So it is with gratitude that we hip-hop heads receive this hour-long documentary rehash.</p><p>It doesn’t go deep into the music itself, a total of 10 tracks – five from Lamar, five from Drake – released between 22 March and 5 May of this year. But there are numerous TikTok explainer videos for that. Rather, Public Enemies works by paralleling the biographies of both artists, to cast light on the present state of hip-hop, the music industry and the culture at large.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/oct/29/public-enemies-kendrick-vs-drake-review-inside-the-beef-that-sent-the-worlds-two-greatest-rap-stars-to-

<p>Where are the fights? Where’s the escapism of gawping at deluded toffs having ludicrously overblown life crises? This catch-up with three Made in Chelsea stars is far too anodyne</p><p>Made in Chelsea is a castle built on the sands of cheating, backstabbing and hysterical arguments, all of which offer perfect vehicles for showing off the inherent passive-aggression of the privileged. This calm and collected spin-off, Beyond Chelsea, follows three of its big-name stars – Binky Felstead, Rosie Fortescue and Lucy Watson – as they navigate their early 30s, through motherhood, businesses (and what businesses they are!), love and dating. Sadly, two of the three are in settled relationships, so the dating takes a back seat to discussions about weaning babies and what they got up to on Made in Chelsea but are far too mature to even consider these days.</p><p>The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles, as Marx and Engels once wrote.

<p><strong>Noël Coward theatre, London</strong> <br>Adding a fourth role to Peter Sellers’ three turns in the classic film, the comic excels in a fun yet unadventurous adaptation</p><p>Stanley Kubrick’s 1964 satire, about cold war brinkmanship tipping into nuclear conflict, seemed to be a vehicle for Peter Sellers to showboat in three central roles. It might have ended up like Carry On … to Armageddon but with the combined genius of Kubrick and Sellers rocketed into the film canon.</p><p>It takes a confident – foolish? – team to tamper with a work quite so revered, and so suited to the screen. How, for instance, do you turn the legendary scene of a pilot riding a careering nuclear warhead into credible theatre? This production achieves the dubious feat of turning an edgy, absurdist story into broad entertainment with accessible laughs, along with a few topical references and excellent performances all round.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2024/oct/29/dr-strangelove-re

<p>Brentford reached the quarter-finals of the Carabao Cup after beating Sheffield Wednesday 5-4 on penalties. Mark Flekken produced the vital save from Liam Palmer to deny the Championship team. Wednesday had fought hard. Brentford had led early through Kevin Schade and looked set to record a comfortable win during the first half.</p><p>Wednesday, 13th in the Championship, had struggled after naming a heavily rotated team. But the underdogs were given hope because of Brentford’s failure to kill them off. The Premier League side lost their way after half-time and were caught out by a brilliant equaliser from Djeidi Gassama. The goal came out of the blue and Brentford were unable to regain their composure, although they had the best chance to win the game in normal time, only for Schade to spurn an inviting opportunity.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/29/brentford-sheffield-wednesday-carabao-cup-fourth-round-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

This one is not related to the pace of energy transition but is purely financial. Soon after getting the top job permanently at the start of the year, the chief executive, Murray Auchincloss, said BP planned to spend $14bn (£10.7bn) buying back shares over the course of 2024 and 2025. Now he’s not so sure about the second lap of the track.</p><p>The $14bn figure is described as “currently unchanged”, meaning the $1.75bn a quarter pace can be maintained for the rest of the year, but a warning has been attached thereafter. Next February, BP will “review elements of our financial guidance, including our expectations for 2025 share buybacks”, said Tuesday’s third-quarter report. In other words, this was pre-guidance guidance that BP expects to change. It is the sort of laborious preamble that is becoming a BP hallmark.</p

For a while, the music follows the pace of his movement, lending this ordinary activity an otherworldly lilt – the whitened trees and paths of New York’s great green lung taking on the air of Grimm Brothers woodland.</p><p>But heavier orchestral intrusions threaten this rhythmic coordination between sound and image. Battering brass and percussion take over as the runner stalls, collapses and dies under Greyshot Arch; as we discordantly cut to shimmery footage of a water birth, the flute section picks up where it left off. Just four minutes into Jonathan Glazer’s brilliant, prismatic second film, one spell has been b

<p>The debate over how to define workers will come back to haunt Rachel Reeves if she cannot convince the public that she’s acting in their interests</p><p>Workers of the world, unite. Nothing’s too good for the workers. You know what it means, instantly, when you see “worker” in a phrase like that – what kind of working people, exactly, is being addressed.</p><p>You know it doesn’t mean billionaires, even if they spend every waking hour in the office. It doesn’t mean people who own a string of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/article/2024/jul/22/number-of-new-uk-buy-to-let-mortgages-halves-in-just-over-a-year">buy-to-lets</a> either, no matter how long they spend managing their property empire. Conversely, you can identify as working class in this sense even if you’re currently not actually doing any work but are on strike, or looking after small children, or even retired.

<p>Bold flavours and satisfying textures combine in this hearty, autumnal, Spanish-style traybake</p><p>This hearty dish is rich, warming and perfect for chilly autumn days, or whenever you crave some comfort food. I’m surprised that jerusalem artichokes are so underused in the UK, especially given their versatility and how easy they are to grow. Don’t be nervous about the whole bulb of garlic here, either: just separate the unpeeled cloves and pop them in – I love sucking out the gooey flesh after they’ve baked. I’ve also used torn sourdough instead of the more traditional migas for a more rustic feel. Serve with a glass of amontillado.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/oct/29/jerusalem-artichoke-chorizo-and-bread-bake-recipe-jose-pizarro">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A fun but often unpalatable collection of recipes by authors including Robert Graves, Norman Mailer and Beryl Bainbridge should come with a trigger warning. Anyone for Instant Mince or Dutch Onion Crisps?</p><p>In most instances, the words “I can’t cook” are a lie: the person saying them is perfectly able in the kitchen, and just being needy, excessively modest or anxious (maybe their sauce split before you arrived). But sometimes, alas, the phrase is just a simple statement of fact. At the tail end of the 1970s, for instance, the editor of a book called <em>Writers’ Favourite Recipes</em> asked the novelist Beryl Bainbridge what she liked to make for supper after a long day at the typewriter. Bainbridge carefully prefaced what she had to tell him with the phrase (used by her children) “I am a very bad cooker”, but the editor was not – woe! – to be put off. Her recipe for Instant Mince was indeed included in the collection, for all that it was quite obviously a crime not only agai

<p>Iain Glen is a sturdy presence leading a Belgian village’s resistance to the German advance, but there are limp scenes and soggy cliches aplenty</p><p>Starting off with that forgettable title, this is a creaky drama that plods blandly through the fictional story of a Belgian farmer leading his village’s resistance to a plundering unit of Germans at the outbreak of the first world war. It all feels a bit familiar, and matters are not helped by the fact that the actors playing Belgians and Germans are all speaking in English in an assortment of accents. Oddly, some accents are more accenty than others; the German characters are all unmistakably German.</p><p>Game of Thrones’s Iain Glen is the film’s heavyweight, bringing a muscular presence to the role of the farmer, Leonard Lambert.
