These ostensibly pro-Harris ads are the product of Progress 2025, a campaign designed to look like the Democratic answer to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24279329/project-2025-tech-policy-guide-trump-admin">the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025</a> — but they’re actually funded by a group called Building America’s Future, a pro-Trump super PAC that is in turn funded by Elon Musk.</p>
