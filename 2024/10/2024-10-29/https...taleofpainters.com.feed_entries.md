<p>A very exciting day for me! It’s my first guest post on Tale of Painters💪. I have been a big fan of the site and artists for such a long time, it’s a real privilege to be able to contribute, albeit in my own small way. To kick off and to celebrate every Orks favourite month, “Orktober”, I would like to share my Beast Snaggas army and showcase photo. "ITS CRUMPIN' TIME!"</p>
