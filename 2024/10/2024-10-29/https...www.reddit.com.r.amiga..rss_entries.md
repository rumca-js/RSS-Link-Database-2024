<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Ever since I first played this game in the 1990s, I wanted to play it against a buddy on another Amiga.</p> <p>But I was never able to successfully link two Amiga via serial port to achieve this. Somewhere, somebody, said that the game&#39;s docs contain information about the cable required - I looked at many pictures (box, manual, ...) but I couldn&#39;t find anything specific. I tried with a cable that I use to send data from one Amiga to the other (like &quot;type text.txt &gt;SER:&quot;), but it didn&#39;t work.</p> <p>Has anyone ever played RVF Honda on two linked Amigas, and can tell me how to do this?</p> <p>(Does it work with WHDLoad?)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/AMIGAalive"> /u/AMIGAalive </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1gf34c4/rvf_honda_great_racing_game_but_impossible_serial/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/co

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Is there a file I can look at on the CD to determine if it contains 3.2, 3.2.1, 3.2.2, 3.2.2.1, or something else?</p> <p>Similarly, are there different versions of the ROM corresponding to these versions, or is there only one version of the 3.2 ROM?</p> <p>Can&#39;t seem to find the answer on Hyperion&#39;s site or the broader web. Thanks for any help!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/sidewaze"> /u/sidewaze </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1gf1kee/how_to_identify_specific_versions_of_amigaos_32x/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1gf1kee/how_to_identify_specific_versions_of_amigaos_32x/">[comments]</a></span>
