<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m very interested in risc-v and I implemented some basic &quot;OS&quot; (barely an &quot;O&quot;) that runs on qemu virt and it was a lot of fun. Now I wanna do it a bit more seriously and on a physical board. I&#39;m looking for a simple risc-v SOC board. It&#39;s really important to me that it&#39;s well documented, simple, and open sourceâ€”I&#39;ve done bare-metal development where the firmware is closed source and the SOC doesn&#39;t even have an official datasheet and it&#39;s a nightmare that I would not like to repeat.</p> <p>Do you have any recommendations?</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/DecentRace9171"> /u/DecentRace9171 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1gf5tbb/recommendations_for_simple_and_well_documented/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1gf5tbb/recommendations_for_simple_and_well_docu

## Unlocking the 2-wire interface of WCH MCU

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>As long as you use WCH&#39;s development boards, everything works fine, but if you use third-party development boards, or make your own prototype, you can neither flash your MCU, nor debug it, using a WCH-LinkE adapter. The reason is that MCU fresh from the factory have their 2-wire interface (the SWDIO and SWCLK signals) disabled by default. WCH enables it on their development boards for convenience.</p> <p>On Windows, you can enable it using WCHISPTool, but this application doesn&#39;t work under Wine, so if you use Linux or Mac, you&#39;re stuck. WCHISPTool can be used for flashing, but it is really, really inconvenient, and it doesn&#39;t allow debugging.</p> <p>I have created a small utility to solve this issue and made it available here: <a href="https://codeberg.org/20-100/Awesome_RISC-V/src/branch/master/WCH/wch-unlock">https://codeberg.org/20-100/Awesome_RISC-V/src/branch/master/WCH/wch-unlock</a></p> <p>Note this problem affects all MCU hav

I followed a playlist on yt by pyjamas and get v.v.basic hang of things. How should I go about doing things now? Like basics, theory of how things are working and just learn and polish my c and assembly skills. To be clear all this low level stuff is also new, never been down to assembly or had to deal with linkers. Rn, I am downloading gnu-toolchain and planning to setup a whole new environment (was having trouble in vectors with the pyjamas one).

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Howdy, got a question for everyone here. I code in my spare time, and ive fooled around with linux in the past, raspberry pis and such, and ive been riscv curious lately. The DC Roma II laptop is something im thinking of picking up, but if i get it id like to get some practical use out of it. </p> <p>My question is, how is it getting software to run? Last time I used Ubuntu it had a software store, but im guessing a large swath of it was set up for x86 processors and wouldnt run on a riscv setup. I think with chrome PWAs you could get some things, but is there like... a riscv repository that everyones getting their software from? Or is it still in the era of getting the source code for something and compiling yourself? Or is there some kind of compatibility layer for running x86 or ARM software?</p> <p>Info on riscv is tough to come by, im guessing because this stuff is all still bleeding edge, so id appreciate any info. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#3
