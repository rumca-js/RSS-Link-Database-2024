<p>Ellen Cushing, in a well-meaning piece for The Atlantic:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>NPR, citing internal Post correspondence, reported that “more than
1,600 digital subscriptions had been cancelled less than four
hours after the news broke.”</p>

<p>It was a reasonable impulse. But if Bezos is indeed why the Post
is no longer endorsing candidates, and if people are worried about
his outsize influence on our society, they should not be canceling
their newspaper subscriptions. They should be <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GTJQ7QZY7QL2HK4Y">canceling their
Amazon Prime subscriptions</a>.</p>

<p>Hartley Charlton, MacRumors:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The 2021 and 2023 iMacs have now been discontinued by Apple and
prices at third-party resellers are falling. As such, some
customers may be weighing up whether to pick up a 2021 or 2023
iMac instead of the latest model, while some existing iMac users
may be wondering if it’s now time to upgrade to the M4 model.</p>

<p>The three Apple silicon iMac models share the overwhelming
majority of their features, so should you consider buying or
sticking with the first- or second-generation models to save
money? This breakdown also serves as a way to see all the
differences that the 2024 iMac brings to the table.</p>

## Jeff Bezos: ‘The Hard Truth: Americans Don’t Trust the News Media’

<p>Jeff Bezos, in an op-ed in his Washington Post:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Presidential endorsements do nothing to tip the scales of an
election. No undecided voters in Pennsylvania are going to say,
“I’m going with Newspaper A’s endorsement.” None. What
presidential endorsements actually do is create a perception of
bias. A perception of non-independence. Ending them is a
principled decision, and it’s the right one. Eugene Meyer,
publisher of The Washington Post from 1933 to 1946, thought the
same, and he was right. By itself, declining to endorse
presidential candidates is not enough to move us very far up the
trust scale, but it’s a meaningful step in the right direction. I
wish we had made the change earlier than we did, in a moment
further from the election and the emotions around it. That was
inadequate planning, and not some intentional strategy.</p>

<p>Bezos has always been a good writer, and this piece is no exception. But deciding to change the Post’s policy
