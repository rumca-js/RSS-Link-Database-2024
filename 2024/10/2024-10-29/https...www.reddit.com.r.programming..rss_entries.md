<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’m in desperate need of some help here. I urgently need to install Turbo C7 on my Mac because I have a practical exam in about 10 days, and it’s on Turbo C7. I’ve spent the entire semester practicing C++ on Xcode, but I now need to brush up on Turbo C7 to avoid mixing up the code and header files during the exam. I’ve tried following two YouTube tutorials, but they were outdated, and I couldn’t figure it out. I’ve been searching everywhere, but there doesn’t seem to be any updated tutorials for Mac. I thought a friend of mine (who’s in IIT) could help, but he was just as clueless about this “dinosaur software” and suggested some alternative that I couldn’t wrap my head around. 😭I know it’s an old tool, and I feel kinda dumb not sorting this earlier, but I really need Turbo C7 working on my Mac so I can practice. Any help, guidance, or links to recent tutorials would be super appreciated!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="htt

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello. I am 13 years old (yes, I know app is 17+; I hope this is not going to be taken down). When I was around twelve, I started learning Python, and it is around 6 month of experience from that day to today (I started programming when I was like 12.5 years old), and while i have pretty good knowledge of many functions, know about classes/objects, know stuff like chr()/ord(), “”.join(lst), bin(num) etc., i feel confused when i do min-projects. For example, for learning python itself I use Programiz, and since I finished master course on it, I moved on to Codewars. Should I call myself dumb if I cannot solve exercises harder than 5-6 kyu?? Please, if somebody can tell other ways to learn, or advices about learning programming languages, since I want to be web-developer, which probably would need to good knowledge of JS, HTML, CSS.</p> <p>I also posted the Codewars link on top.</p> <p>(English is not my first language; sorry for any mistakes!)</p> </d
