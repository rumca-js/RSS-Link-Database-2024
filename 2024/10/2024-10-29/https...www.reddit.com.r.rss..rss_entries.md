<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I really wanted was to just check the most important subjects everyday, and check the ones I have the time and the interest to delve.</p> <p>I&#39;m subscribed to some RSS feeds from news providers, but all of them post hundreds and hundreds of news every week, so everyday I end up missing info I should have payed attention to.</p> <p>Is there any RSS aggregator capable of comparing multiple sources to find the most relevant subjects?</p> <p>It could present a custom feed only of prioritized subjects, or list all the news somewhat related to this same subject, or maybe it does that weekly but not daily, whatever, and I know that something like that is pretty hard to work perfectly for tons of different reasons, but even with mistakes happening all the time, a feature like that would definitely help me to stay updated...</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/mateusonego"> /u/mateusonego <
