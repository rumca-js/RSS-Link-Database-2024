After some tinkering and adjustments, I ended up with a set that measures just 82mm by 79mm with a height of only 9mm—a surprisingly small and portable design.Rather than using traditional chess pieces, I opted for small cubes with images of each piece printed on their surfaces. This approach not only keeps the set functional but also allows the entire board to remain just 9mm high. The lid is designed to stay securely in place through friction, ensuring that the pieces remain intact when the set is closed and carried around.</p> </div><!-- S

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I work with kids and I recently introduced this game. The kids were really into it. However, we couldn’t figure out from the rules and from everything I’ve read online what the guidelines are for the shadowlings moving during their turn aside from the fact that they can’t cross the beam of light. It seems like it is too easy for the shadowlings to win if they are able to figure out a way to skirt around the board without crossing the beam of light and if there aren’t any restrictions to how many of them can move in one turn. Anyone else experience this confusion or have advice on this?

When I trade - am I (as a trader on my turn) allowed to trade from my hand ignoring two card I draw for open trade completely? So, basically - I draw two cards and I&#39;m OK to plant them myself, but I want to drop some cards from my hand, so I make an offer (offering something exactly from my hand) and trade. OR I can only use my hand to support some deal <strong>involving</strong> the two cards I draw for market in my round?

I had a chat with the Team there, but didn&#39;t have a chance to play (if someone did - please, share your impressions). So far - it looks a bit (too?) simple to me. Honestly, I&#39;d indeed prefer less complexity in comparison with Hegemony, so simplification is good, but still... &quot;World Order&quot; kind of implies some epic scale and after watching some videos / reviews - I&#39;m not convinced that this game will provide this scale. As I understood also - it&#39;s based on 2010 status and also it is not really assymetrical (which again - not sure yet: is it good or bad). Kind of think that powers should be assymetrical... So, to be short: what is your view so far. I personally will support this one (if price is not crazy) since I don&#39;t see modern alternatives. I really wanted to try &quo

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Recently I sold off my whole collection of 50+ games and took a break from the hobby. I wasn&#39;t spending too much or anything, I just wanted a clean start with a hyper focused collection of games that I love. </p> <p>I&#39;m starting up again and limiting myself to two kallax cubes worth of game storage for my entire collection. I play almost entirely solo games with the occasional light two player game. I&#39;m someone who enjoys big, heavy games so having such a strict space restriction has made me think a lot about enjoyment vs. complexity vs. box size and number of components. Mage Knight is one of my all time favorites, but the Ultimate Edition box is massive. </p> <p>Here&#39;s where I&#39;m currently at:</p> <p>Pax Pamir 2E</p> <p>John Company</p> <p>Onirim, Stellarion, Aerion, Sylvion</p> <p>If you pared your collection down to two Kallax cubes, <strong>what would be in your collection?</strong></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I know everyone is allowed to not like any game and it&#39;s normal for different people to have preference. But it&#39;s a so critically acclaimed game even though it&#39;s not available in retail yet. I won&#39;t be surprised if it climbs to the top 25 on BGG in a year. Again I know only heavy gamers browse and rate games on BGG. But I consider this is a gamer&#39;s game. I feel weird or bad for not liking this one even though I know no one should feel this way. Can anyone share theirs thoughts if you don&#39;t like this?</p> <p>There&#39;s so many good things about this game so I would just focus on the reasons I don&#39;t like:</p> <p><strong>The tricking-taking is a little gimmicky.</strong></p> <p>It doesn&#39;t feel like trick-taking and it doesn&#39;t have to be like that. But it&#39;s only an alternative of action-selection mechanism. I rarely think of oppoents&#39; cards. Maybe I&#39;m bad some people would do if they are good and serious.
