<p>As a new show co-created by an AI performer opens in France, industry leaders including Wayne McGregor, Tamara Rojo and Jonzi D contemplate the technology’s possibilities and perils</p><p>‘I think AI’s going to change everything,” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2024/jan/29/tamara-rojo-san-francisco-ballet">Tamara Rojo</a>, artistic director of San Francisco Ballet, told me earlier this year. “We just don’t know quite how.” The impact of artificial intelligence on the creative industries can already be seen across film, television and music, but to some extent dance seems insulated, as a form that so much relies on live bodies performing in front of an audience. But this week choreographers Aoi Nakamura and Esteban Lecoq, collectively known as <a href="https://aoiesteban.com/">AΦE</a>, are launching what is billed as the world’s first AI-driven dance production, Lilith.Aeon.

What a precedent: I’m desperately hoping the entertainment industry rallies around to prevent it ever happening again. We can probably count on it. The dance of all chatshows these days is almost entirely mechanised. You go on. You do your rehearsed anecdotes. The news that the late Michael Parkinson is being <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/oct/26/michael-parkinson-virtually-ai-replica-chatshow">relaunched as an AI</a> barely raises an eyebrow because it’s all so synthetic anyway.</p><p>Therefore the moments when it isn’t take on outsize significance.

<p>Cheesy, herby pieces of toast piled high with flavour</p><p>Make the basil oil: pour 6 tbsp of <strong>olive oil</strong> into a blender jug and add 2 tbsp of warm water. Pull 15 medium-sized <strong>basil leaves</strong> (about 5g) from their stalks and add them to the oil with a good pinch of sea salt and a grinding or two of black pepper. Process all the ingredients to a deep green dressing.</p><p>Get an overhead grill hot. Remove the stalks from 3 or 4 large <strong>tomatoes</strong> and a handful of smaller ones. Cut the larger ones in half. Leave the small tomatoes whole. Put them all on a grill pan or baking sheet, trickle lightly with some more olive oil, and place them under the grill. Leave until their skins have started to brown here and there and the tomatoes are soft and juicy.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/oct/29/nigel-slaters-recipe-for-tomato-ricotta-and-basil-toasts">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Past threats former president – and present Russian ones – have spurred Europe to invest in self-defence, but as conflicts rise the alliance still looks vital</p><p>Politeness and convention dictate that European leaders try to sound noncommittal when asked whether a Donald Trump presidency would hurt Nato. But despite the rhetoric about “Trump-proofing”, Nato cohesion will be at risk from a hostile or isolationist Republican president, who has previously threatened to leave the alliance if European defence spending did not increase.</p><p>“The truth is that the US is Nato and Nato is the US; the dependence on America is essentially as big as ever,” said Jamie Shea, a former Nato official who teaches at the University of Exeter. “Take the new Nato command centre to coordinate assistance for Ukraine in Wiesbaden, Germany. It is inside a US army barracks, relying on US logistics and software.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/29/if-trump-wins-the-election-na

<p>Division’s first female coach discusses the reaction from the club’s players and fans and why she is not feeling pressure</p><p>“I can say so far so good,” Jackline Juma says, two and a half months after becoming the first female coach of a men’s team in the Kenyan Premier League. Results have been mixed after five points from five games but there are signs of progress that FC Talanta are on course to achieve her first target: avoiding a repeat of last season’s relegation battle, when the Nairobi club survived by a point. Really though, the 38-year-old wants a top-six finish in the 18-team league.</p><p>There is, of course, a bigger picture. Being a female coach of a top-tier professional men’s team could be a gamechanger if it goes well, but what if it doesn’t? “I don’t feel the pressure of being a representative female coach,” Juma says. “The chances of failing are possible; all coaches know that.
