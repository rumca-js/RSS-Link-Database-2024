I am working on it to fix this. </p> <p>I believe things cant be that difficult, Is there any simple way to deploy cookiecutter-django app to kubernetes cluster on azure??</p> <p>Thanks </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/lonedevlpr\"> /u/lonedevlpr </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/", "id": 1411453, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/1gf71s2/django_with_celery_and_postgres_database_to_aks", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 491, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/django/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Django with celery and postgres database to AKS", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-10-29T17:10:33+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>The AI boom has brought so many frameworks and tools to the python community but very few of them use Django as their main backbone. </p> <p>Since I think Django has some unbelievable features, I decided to make the next AI tool with Django. </p> <p>It&#39;s goal is to improve the developer experience for developers that use frameworks like llama-index and langchain. </p> <p>here is the project </p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/epuerta9/kitchenai\">https://github.com/epuerta9/kitchenai</a></p> <p>If you like it, please give it a star and share \u2b50 </p> <p>Also looking for contributors if anyone is interested :) </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/wait-a-minut\"> /u/wait-a-minut </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/1geztln/django_and_ai/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/1geztln/django_and_ai/\">[comments]</a></span>", "id": 1409620, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/1geztln/django_and_ai", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 491, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/django/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Django and AI", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-10-29T14:26:25+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/zs5mkuckfpxd1.png?width=335&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4d18a733335ce6721b806ee157fcfadf8d45a024\">screenshot error</a></p> <p>i make item add logic with CreateView class for user foreignkey user relation but when i give image input it does take image input and show (this field is required). i already give image input, again showing same error. i already write MEDIA_URL and other media settings</p> <pre><code>class ItemCreateView(CreateView): model = Item fields = [&#39;name&#39;,&#39;desp&#39;,&#39;price&#39;,&#39;image&#39;] template_name = &#39;add.html&#39; success_url = reverse_lazy(&#39;home&#39;) def form_valid(self, form): form.instance.user = self.request.user return super().form_valid(form) </code></pre> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Legal_Relief6756\"> /u/Legal_Relief6756 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/1gevx6d/form", "id": 1408123, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/1gevx6d/form_dont_get_image_input", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 491, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/django/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "form don't get image input", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-10-29T11:32:29+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I am working with CustomUser model which is inherting User model.
