<p dir="ltr">One of the most-iconic horror franchises ever is Scream, where a hooded figure in a ghost mask terrorizes a local community across multiple films. With Halloween coming up, NetherRealm has announced its plans to keep the scares going into next month, as Ghostface enters Mortal Kombat 1 on November 19 for those with early access.</p><p dir="ltr">A brief teaser trailer appeared on the official Mortal Kombat YouTube channel, which offers brief glimpses at Ghostface's arsenal of moves. We see him attack Johnny Cage as he sits on a couch watching TV in one scene, while another depicts him taking a stab at Raiden.</p><p dir="ltr">Along with these flashes, we also see an array of masks that Ghostface can wear that add more flair to the infamous howling ghost. One dons a ninja mask like Scorpion, another is red with devil horns, and a third has massive teeth jutting out from its mouth.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ghostface-stalks-his-way-into-mortal-kombat-1-in

<p dir="ltr">There's an argument to be made that speed is what makes Call of Duty multiplayer feel so good. As a franchise, the CoD games are great about getting you into the action as quickly as possible. When you shoot opponents, they tend to go down fast; when you die, you can be back in the fight in about a second. With <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a>, Treyarch leans into the speed of the franchise in just about every respect, starting with some meaningful adjustments to movement systems and ending with map designs that make sure you're never far from your next hail of bullets. Most of the time, those fast and intense battles are a lot of fun--but the design changes also result in Black Ops 6 feeling limited in the kinds of fights you're likely to face.</p><p dir="ltr">The major adjustment Black Ops 6 brings to the series is the Omni-movement system, and at least in terms of how the game feels to play, it's an excel

<p dir="ltr">There's an almost imperceptible sound you hear when you cross the threshold of a haunted house in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/phasmophobia/">Phasmophobia</a>, the co-op ghost-hunting game from Kinetic Games that took Steam and Twitch by storm in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. As you exit your equipment truck and approach the front door, leaving the outdoor air and rain behind you, you enter a claustrophobic, dark space where a low, airy hum pervades all rooms and floors. This sound, which senior developer Ben Lavender calls "basically [...] nothing," has an outsized, unnerving effect, though when you first hear it, it's difficult to explain why. It was one of the first details I noticed about the game, and it's one of several finely tuned tricks Phasmophobia employs to be one of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-horror-games/2900-4900/">best horror games</a> in any era.</p><p dir="ltr">"Room tone," Lavender told me, is a practice

Unlike Wes Craven with Elm Street and John Carpenter with Halloween, there aren't any beloved filmmakers making their marks here. Even so, yearly releases during the 1980s established Jason Voorhees as one of cinema's scariest killers, but thanks to a whole pile of battles over who actually has the right to make more Friday the 13th flicks, we haven't had a new movie in the series since the very (commercially) successful 2009 reboot. That's a bummer, but the franchise is still one of our favorites to revisit every spooky season because there's just something about that guy and his hockey mask--and, fortunately, there's a prequel TV series in the works that will hopefully exist someday.</p><p dir="ltr">There are 12 movies overall in the Friday the 13th franchise.

<p>With the upcoming launch of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mass-effect-andromeda/">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> this week, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-5-everything-we-know-about-bioware-upcoming-rpg/1100-6485779/">Mass Effect 5</a> project director Michael Gamble has commented on some of the differences that players will see between BioWare's fantasy and sci-fi franchises. One thing that Mass Effect fans can expect to see kept intact is the realistic art direction of that series, as opposed to the stylized visual approach of the new Dragon Age game.</p><p>"Mass Effect is photorealistic and will be as long as I'm running it," <a href="https://x.com/GambleMike/status/1850999886763983193">Gamble wrote on X</a> (formerly Twitter) in response to a comment about Dragon Age's art direction. In terms of mood, Gamble added that "Mass Effect will maintain the mature tone" of the original trilogy of games, <a href="https://x.com/GambleMike/status/18511042

<p dir="ltr">Bart and Homer will confront one another in a brand-new way in December. The iconic Simpsons characters will show up on an animated NFL field as the Cincinnati Bengals face the Dallas Cowboys on December 9. It's all part of The Simpsons Funday Football, a special Monday Night Football presentation that will display the action in animated form on Atoms Stadium in Springfield.</p><p dir="ltr">The Simpsons Funday Football show will stream on Disney+ and ESPN+ (as well as NFL+ on mobile) starting at 5 PM PT / 8 PM ET on December 9. For most of the NFL game, Sony's Beyond Sports Technology will transform Bengals and Cowboys players into The Simpsons world. But, during specific plays and moments, Bart will show up on the field with the Bengals, and Homer will do the same for the Cowboys.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1813/18138562/4391866-simpsons-funday-football-ec-scaled.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-43918

<p>Trailers for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle have nailed the tone of the franchise. The triumphant John Williams theme song, Harrison Ford's sly smirk, all accompanied with the crack of a whip and the distant howl of a Wilhelm scream. These are stylistic staples in the 43-year-old franchise that has had five films, a handful of games, and a TV show. There's no doubt that developer MachineGames understands the look and feel of Indy, but questions have lingered around its ability to capture <em>playing </em>as the globetrotter. Now that I've had some hands-on time with the game, it's clear to me MachineGames understands more than just the aesthetic of Indiana Jones, but also what it means to <em>be</em> Indiana Jones. The result is a promising prospect not just for fans of the franchise, but the adventure genre as a whole.</p><p dir="ltr">Taking place between Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Last Crusade, The Great Circle sees the titular character a year removed from his globe-tr

<p>Christopher Lee lived a life that was almost out of legend. He was friends with both JRR Tolkien and Ian Fleming and eventually portrayed iconic characters from their respective worlds. Lee portrayed the dark wizard Saruman in both The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit franchises, and despite having passed away in 2015, the actor will reprise his role from beyond the grave in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-war-of-the-rohirrim-trailer-goes-all-in-with-war-and-magic/1100-6526058/">The War of Rohirrim</a>.</p><p>Philippa Boyens, a longtime collaborator of Peter Jackson and co-writer of The Lord of the Rings and Hobbit films, spoke with TheOneRing.net at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPlYVYvC1Us">New York Comic Con</a> and confirmed that Saruman will make an appearance, once again voiced by Lee.</p><div data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCUg6Td5fgQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe sr

While 2023 was loaded with modern masterpieces like Baldur's Gate 3, Street Fighter 6, and Alan Wake 2, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/2024-upcoming-games-release-schedule/1100-6518504/">2024</a> has delivered hits like Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree, Dragon's Dogma 2, and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth.</p><p>While those games were almost predestined to to launch with high review scores behind them, it's the unexpected games released this year that have overshadowed them. We've had some terrific hits that have seemingly come from out of nowhere, like the gung-ho action of Helldivers 2, the oddball British humor of Thank Goodness You're Here, and not one but <em>two </em>Prince of Per
