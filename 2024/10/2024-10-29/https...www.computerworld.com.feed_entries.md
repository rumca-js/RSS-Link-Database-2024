<p>Channel conversations — currently accessed in the team section — will be moved to chat. The goal is to make it easier for users to view all their messages in one place rather than continuously switching between sections. </p>

<p>The web has been a mixed blessing for people who care about information. Yes, it’s made it easier than ever to access facts and opinions from around the globe — but it also throws out older data as quickly as it brings in new data. (And let’s not even talk about propaganda!)</p>



<p>One shining beacon for recording truthful and accurate records throughout the web’s history has been the <a href="http://archive.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Internet Archive</a>.</p>

<p>Amidst the mountains of vendor cheerleading for generative AI efforts, often amplified by enterprise board members, skeptical CIOs tend to feel outnumbered. But their cynical worries may now have some company, in the form of a report from Apple and an interview from Meta — both of which raise serious questions about whether genAI can actually do much of what its backers claim.</p>



<p>The debate involves some fairly amorphous terms, at least when spoken in a computing environment context — things like reasoning and logic. When a <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/1627101/what-are-large-language-models-and-how-are-they-used-in-generative-ai.html">large language model (LLM)</a>, for

<p>The US government has announced new rules restricting investments in China’s AI and other tech sectors deemed threats to national security, expanding the existing restrictions that were so far limited to exports.</p>



<p>First introduced by the US Treasury in June, the rules are based on an executive order signed by President Joe Biden in August 2023.</p>



<p>They focus on three critical areas: semiconductors and microelectronics, quantum information technologies, and certain AI systems.</p>



<p>“This narrow set of technologies is core to the next generation of military, cybersecurity, surveillance, and intelligence applications,” the Treasury said in a statement.</p>
