On Deadly Ground is the mega blockbuster hit movie where Steven Segal protects the environment by blowing up massive pieces of it, and proves that he truly is a double threat - not only can he not act, but he can't direct either. Join me and Space Ice as we explore the man, the myth and the legend who made this thing.
