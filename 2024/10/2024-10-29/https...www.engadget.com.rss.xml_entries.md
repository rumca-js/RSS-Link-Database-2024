<p>Polestar EV owners will soon have a lot more charging options. The company said on Tuesday its lineup now has access to the Tesla Supercharger network in the US and Canada. Future Polestar vehicles will adopt the NACS inlet as standard, and current owners can buy an adapter beginning today at their local Polestar Service Point.</p>
<p>A Polestar spokesperson told Engadget that the adapter has an MSRP of $230, so this isn’t a free upgrade. However, that accessory will add 17,800 charging stations across North America, so owners may find that’s a relatively small price to pay for extra peace of mind on their next road trip.</p>

<p>Today, NASA published a <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://esawebb.org/images/potm2410a/"><ins>new image</ins></a> of the Phantom Galaxy, also known as M74 and NGC 628. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) captured it. This isn’t the first time we’ve seen the Webb telescope send a picture of the Phantom Galaxy back. NASA previously <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/james-webb-hubble-capture-image-of-m74-phantom-galaxy-172850395.html"><ins>published one</ins></a> in 2022.</p>
<p>Below is the 2022 image for comparison. Despite the different colors, it’s clear that both images are of the same galaxy.</p>

Apple’s three-prong approach includes prevention, awareness and assistance with hearing protection, hearing test and hearing aid tools available directly on an iPhone.</p>
<p>People have been eagerly anticipating these hearing health features since Apple announced them in early September. I’ve had numerous friends and family members who aren’t regular Apple users inquire about the hearing test and hearing aid features specifically. The tools have the
