In HW News this week, Intel's Battlemage makes an appearance, its 12th Gen Alder Lake CPUs are on fire sale, the 9800X3D is rumored to have flipped cache, and Valve has thoughts on not iterating Steam Decks annually. We also talk about the Arm vs. Qualcomm news, an AR gaming handheld (of sorts), and rumors of the AMD Z2.
