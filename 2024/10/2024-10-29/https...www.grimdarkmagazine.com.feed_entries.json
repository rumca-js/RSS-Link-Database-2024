But after team GdM has loved stories like Lee Mandelo\u2019s The Woods All Black and Smothermoss by Alisa Alering, I couldn\u2019t pass up another disturbing read set in this wild place. The Bog Wife by Kay Chronister is an entirely unexpected read, equal parts compelling, unnerving, and hard to describe without giving too much of the plot away. I shall try my best! As far as the Haddesley siblings know, their family has been the custodians of their bog in the heart of West Virginia for generations. They look after the bog, and in turn, the bog provides for them \u2013 including the provision of a wife for each generation\u2019s heir. A bog wife made of sticks, peat, and other swamp detritus to carry on the family line. When the bog fails (whether as a snub or because of an inability they do not know) to provide the next bog wife, everything they have ever known crumbles around them.
