Clock Tower officially arrives for the first time outside of Japan with Clock Tower Rewind. WayForward has joined up with Limited Run Games has released the original Super Famicom port from 1995 in addition to a remastered version of Clock Tower: The First Fear. 

Clock Tower Rewind functions as a point and click adventure game, with plenty of pixel hunting and vague puzzle solutions. The convenience features added to Clock Tower Rewind hardly make it more accessible to newer players, but this version does have a rewind feature and save states at the least. 

If you’re a fan of old-school survival horror and want to see one of the seminal games of the genre, Clock Tower Rewind offers a hauntingly atmospheric experience that delivers with its scares and tone.

Ghost of Tsushima ranks as one of the best games we’ve played in recent memory, so it goes without saying that anticipation for the announcement of a sequel had been high for some time. 

Earlier this year, we did get that announcement, with developer Sucker Punch confirming that the sequel, Ghost of Yotei, is going to launch next year and bring players an entirely new setting to explore, and a new protagonist to play as. 

Given the strong story that was told in the first game and that fan following that Jin has amassed, you can understand why some would have wanted a direct sequel, but ultimately, we feel Sucker Punch has made the best possible choice with Ghost of Yotei in choosing not to develop it as a direct sequel.
