<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I just finished Slayer by David Guymer, and I was wondering what would be the next books to read. They were my first books in the universe of Warhammer Fantasy, and I loved them, so I want to dive into this universe and to discover as much lore as possible.</p> <p>What would be the logical next step? Goodreads tells me that the first book of the series is The Burning Shore by Robert Earl (Florin and Lorenzo series). Is that right?</p> <p>Just a side point: I thought that a lot of critical info about the End Times was missing from the final books of the series. Like, it was hinted that Morrslieb exploded, but there&#39;s nothing about it in the previous books, so I was wondering what happened there, and also other things, but that is the first thing that comes to mind.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/EquivalentEntire1196"> /u/EquivalentEntire1196 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/
