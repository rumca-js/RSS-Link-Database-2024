<p>AMD will launch its next-gen PC GPUs with RDNA 5 technology in early 2025, AMD chief executive Dr. Lisa Su said Tuesday. They will be part of what she called the strongest PC portfolio in the company’s history.</p>



<p>Su delivered the roadmap update during prepared remarks to analysts, describing the company’s results during the third quarter of 2024.</p>



<p>Roughly half of AMD’s revenue comes from its data-center products, so Wall Street analysts focused most of their attention on that part of the business. AMD’s GPUs fall within its Gaming business, where revenue fell 69 percent to $462 million. That’s because the segment also includes AMD’s GPUs for gaming consoles, and Microsoft and Sony alike decreased the amount of inventory they had on hand.</p>



<p>PC graphics also declined, as card makers and PC vendors began holding off, as well, anticip

<p>The latest version of Microsoft Office is here, and you can get it without a recurring subscription payment. Normally, Microsoft charges $150 for the base version of Office Home 2024, which is pretty hefty for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. But <a href="https://software.pcworld.com/p44573-microsoft_office_home_2024">the official PCWorld software store has it for 20 percent off, just $119.99</a>. This deal will only last for another two days, so hop on it quick.</p>



<p>This digital copy of Office Home works with Windows 10 or 11, or even macOS if that’s your thing. The <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2475992/microsoft-office-2024-is-finally-available-no-subscription-needed.html">latest versions of Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint</a> pack in a ton of new features like a refined user interface, better support for OpenDocument Format, improved

<p>Chrome is the undisputed king of the browser space, but the peasants are revolting over its shift to a new browser extension standard.

<p>Now, the perennial browser underdog Opera is committing to support uBlock Origin and other older extensions, despite relying on Chromium’s open-source codebase.</p>



<p>In a blog post earlier this month, the developers of Opera made it clear that they intend to keep supporting at least some Manifest V2 extensions. While Opera shifted to a Chromium engine years ago — Chromium remains the base for most popular browsers today, with one notable exception in Firefox — Opera’s developers are making ch

<p>Valve’s Steam Deck has been a phenomenon for PC gamers, but there’s just one problem: You can’t pick the parts and assemble it yourself. That’s half the fun of PC gaming! (The other half is eating ramen noodles and pawning all your belongings to afford those PC parts.)</p>



<p>But one modder combined the flexible hardware of the Framework Laptop and a 3D printer to create her own handheld system.</p>



<p>The “<a href="https://www.printables.com/model/1051411-framework-portable-handheld-case-beth-deck/">Beth Deck</a>” is available on 3D printing enthusiast site Printables (spotted by <a href="https://liliputing.com/build-your-own-handheld-gaming-pc-with-a-framework-mainboard-and-this-3d-printed-case/">Liliputing</a>), and it’s an impressive work of DIY engineering.

<p>Smart lights are a fun and high-tech way to spruce up your home, and they’re especially enticing when they’re on sale.</p>



<p>For example, Nanoleaf’s Elements panels are hexagonal smart lights that are simply gorgeous and versatile — and right now <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/nanoleaf-elements-hexagons-smarter-kit-7-panels-wood-look/6468313.p?skuId=6468313">this 7-pack starter kit is on sale for $160 at Best Buy</a>, a $90 savings on its $150 original price.</p>



<p>The great thing about hexagons isn’t that they fit together perfectly, but that you can arrange them however you want. With a bit of creative flair, you can form whatever shape or layout appeals to you, and you can always expand later just by buying more panels.</p>



<p>This particular variant of the Nanoleaf Elements is especially classy because of its wood look, which lends t

<p>Amazon’s newest, biggest, and most powerful Fire Max 11 tablet is down to its best price once more, making now the best time to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-powerful-display-octa-core-processor/dp/B0B1VQ1ZQY/">snag this 11-inch tablet for just $140</a>. That’s $90 (or 39 percent) off its original price.</p>



<p>The Amazon Fire Max 11 has a vivid 11-inch display that’s perfect for streaming content, reading ebooks, and playing tablet games. The powerful octa-core processor delivers snappier performance that beats out all previous Fire models.</p>



<p>It stands out as one of the best tablets you can get in this price range — at least when it’s on sale. Our biggest gripe with the Fire Max 11 is that it’s normally priced a bit too high for what you get, but when it’s cut down by this much, it’s suddenly a pretty good bargain.</p>
