If relentlessly amassing sticks and bopping rocks is starting to feel a little stale in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/disney-dreamlight-valley">Disney Dreamlight Valley</a>, there's something new on the horizon. Developer Gameloft has announced The Storybook Vale, the village-life sim's second paid expansion, that'll whisk players to a world of Greek myths, Scottish folktales, and more when it launches on 20th November.

Fntastic, the developer behind last year's widely derided zombie shooter The Day Before, is - having already been embroiled in controversy over its use of hundreds of unpaid vounteers - now asking community members to design maps to put in its next game as part of a newly announced "contest", but it won't be paying winners for their work.

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/whisper-it-but-dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-me-thinking-the-unthinkable-it-looks-like-bioware-is-back">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> is a radical departure from the current AAA norm of releasing games on PC with half-baked or flat-out broken technical problems. It is polished with a smart user experience, it is smooth running where it counts - and as a PC version should, it offers noticeably higher fidelity than console equivalents, tapping into the strengths of the platform. It's a game that deserves praise - if not flat-out celebration - in that its execution is just so good, running well on mainstream hardware right up to the best of the best.

## No More Room in Hell 2 early access review - slow-burn cooperative shooter gets zombie horror (mostly) right

Surrounded by shambling corpses, barricades shrieking under their literal dead weight, you'll be popping zombie heads with grim precision when cold reality sets in. Maybe it's the click of your revolver as its ammo runs dry that triggers the revelation, or a fellow survivor you barely know being overwhelmed by the horde. Maybe it's just the sight of another score of undead stumbling into silhouetted view. Either way, the feeling is the same: you're going to die, and no amount of struggle will prevent it.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-more-room-in-hell-2-early-access-review">Read more</a></p>

You'd think the acclaim of shows like The Last of Us and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout">Fallout</a> would be ushering in a new dawn of franchises that successfully straddle TV, cinema, and gaming, and yet here I am, slogging my way through yet another sterile, slow, and offensively forgettable licensed offering that fails not only seasoned players but also any newbies unfortunate enough to have chosen <em>this</em> franchise jump into gaming for the first time, too. It's astonishing, really, given the A Quiet Place movies are, on paper, perfect fodder for a terrifying video game adaptation.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-quiet-place-the-road-ahead-review-a-forgettable-waste-of-a-license">Read more</a></p>
