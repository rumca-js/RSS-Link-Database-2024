The Miyawaki forest method involves planting a diverse mix of densely packed native woodland trees—or "tiny forests"—that grow quickly in small areas, around the size of a tennis court.

Today, people increasingly seek non-alcoholic versions of beer or wine. Despite boasting different flavors, these two drinks share many aromas, which makes it difficult to produce alcohol-free versions that mimic the real thing. Researchers in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry report on a literature analysis and experiment to characterize the chemical compounds that give beer and wine their unique fragrances. They say their findings could aid the development of flavorful, non-alcoholic substitutes.

Glycans are chains of sugars that attach to cells through proteins or lipids, changing their chemical characteristics. Glycans can be incredibly complex and branched in structure, contributing to the stability of the extracellular domain of cells and proteins. Exactly how and why proteins and lipids are glycosylated, or modified with glycans after synthesis, remains largely unknown.

A team led by scientists at the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics (MPE) used the eROSITA All-Sky Survey data and found a large-scale temperature gradient in this bubble, possibly linked with past supernova explosions that expanded and reheated the bubble.

In the fight against antibiotic resistance, a new technology developed at Chalmers University of Technology, in Sweden, can be of great importance when, for example, hip and knee implants are surgically inserted. By heating up small nanorods of gold with near-infrared light (NIR), the bacteria are killed, and the surface of the implant becomes sterile. The researchers are now presenting a new study that increases the understanding of how the gold rods are affected by light and how the temperature in them can be measured.
