Texas is on the leading edge of book censorship in the United States &#8212; you know, the land most famous for its freedoms, one of which is the famous/infamous (depending on who you ask) First Amendment.

Donald Trump and the politicians that either think like him, or think saying things like this might make him like them, continue to pretend major US cities are besieged by violent criminals. While there have been a few spikes in certain cities, for the most part, crime rates are returning to their normal, historic lows [&#8230;]

Hey Jeff, Since I know you’ll never actually read this, I figured the best way to set this up as an open letter. One that you should read, but never will. It appears that your stupendously cowardly decision to block the Washington Post from publishing its planned endorsement of Kamala Harris just days before the [&#8230;]

There must be something about the alcohol business that creates silly trademark disputes over geographic terms. We&#8217;ve seen this several times in the past, such as in the whole Ravinia Festival dispute, or the time two breweries fought over a trademark for the neighborhood one of them operated out of.
