At a 3 million square foot facility in Louisville, Kentucky, Arvato provides supply chain management, warehousing, and fulfillment services for B2B and B2C clients. \n\nWhen Arvato's Louisville staff wanted a robotics system that could unload freight with greater speed and safety, Boston Dynamics' Stretch robot stood out. Stretch is a first of its kind mobile robot designed specifically to unload boxes from trailers and shipping containers, freeing up employees to focus on more meaningful tasks in the warehouse. Arvato acquired its first Stretch system this year and the robot's impact was immediate.\n\nLearn more about how Arvato is using Stretch: https://bosdyn.co/4e83Z6O\nRegister on LinkedIn for a live fireside chat with Arvato: https://bosdyn.co/4f1VYBE", "id": 1408050, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGbsDK3Cjxw", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 451, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC7vVhkEfw4nOGp8TyDk7RcQ", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/MGbsDK3Cjxw/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Stretch at Arvato | Boston Dynamics", "vote": 0}]
