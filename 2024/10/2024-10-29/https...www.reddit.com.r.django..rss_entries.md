<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am anodejs developer, recently started working on django and i liked the simplicity and power of framework, i configured a project using cookiecutter-django, this had everything you need to start the app, i created a decent working MVP but now i want to deploy it on AKS, not sure how to do that, tried AKS github workflows to deploy but failed, then i managed to write shell scripting to provision new AKS cluster along with azure container registry, and this script is building, pushing and deploy image to AKS, but things still not working for me, i am not able to open app using public ip. I am working on it to fix this. </p> <p>I believe things cant be that difficult, Is there any simple way to deploy cookiecutter-django app to kubernetes cluster on azure??</p> <p>Thanks </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/lonedevlpr"> /u/lonedevlpr </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am working with CustomUser model which is inherting User model. And in other models where I needed CustomUser model as ForeignKey(fk), at the top of the <a href="http://model.py">model.py</a> I use <code>User=get_user_model()</code> and use User in the models.</p> <p>Recently, I need to set up an extra field m2m field with the CustomUser. When I try to makemigrations, i got an error like CustomUser model not defined, app is not installed etc.</p> <p>I also tried using get_user_model() method directly in the field. But I got CircularImport Error.</p> <p>How do I fix this? I am on the verge of resetting the entire database. So please help. If you have thoughts or standard way of doing this, please tell</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/captainrdx"> /u/captainrdx </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/1gesdha/working_with_customuser_model/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><
