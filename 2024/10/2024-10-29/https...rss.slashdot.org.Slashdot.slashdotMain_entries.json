From a report: It found carbon dioxide is accumulating faster than at any time in human history, with concentrations having risen by more than 10% in just two decades. \"Another year, another record,\" said Celeste Saulo, secretary-general of the WMO. \"This should set alarm bells ringing among decision makers.\" The increase was driven by humanity's \"stubbornly high\" burning of fossil fuels, the WMO found, and made worse by big wildfires and a possible drop in the ability of trees to absorb carbon. The concentration of CO2 reached 420 parts per million (ppm) in 2023, the scientists observed. The level of pollution is 51% greater than before the Industrial Revolution, when people began to burn large amounts of coal, oil and fossil gas.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com", "id": 1408233, "language": null, "link": "https://news.slashdot.org/story/24/10/29/144245/planet-heating-pollutants-in-atmosphere-hit-record-levels-in-2023?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 306, "source_url": "https://rss.slashdot.org/Slashdot/slashdotMain", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Planet-Heating Pollutants in Atmosphere Hit Record Levels in 2023", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-10-29T13:37:27.169065+00:00", "description": "Longtime Slashdot reader AmiMoJo shares a report from the Associated Press: Tech behemoth OpenAI has touted its artificial intelligence-powered transcription tool Whisper as having near \"human level robustness and accuracy.\" But Whisper has a major flaw: It is prone to making up chunks of text or even entire sentences, according to interviews with more than a dozen software engineers, developers and academic researchers.
