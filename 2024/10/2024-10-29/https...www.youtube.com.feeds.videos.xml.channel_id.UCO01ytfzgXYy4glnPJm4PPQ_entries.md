Matt Walsh walks a mile in Jussie Smollett's Uggs and experiences the trauma of the hate crime epidemic first-hand.

Today on the Matt Walsh Show, I have uncovered incontrovertible proof that Donald Trump is, in fact, a Nazi and literally Hitler. The media has been right all along. I'll lay out the evidence today. Also, Tim Walz is really leaning into his football coach persona. It hasn't gone well so far. And “60 Minutes” warns that Trump's immigration policies may break up illegal immigrant families. Is that actually true? And if it is, should we care? Plus, readers of The Washington Post are outraged after the paper declines to endorse any candidate this election cycle.

Michelle Obama gives a shockingly angry and bitter speech, hoping to convince men to vote by berating them. I don't think it will work.
