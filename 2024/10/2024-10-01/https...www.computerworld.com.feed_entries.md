<p>The capabilities and shortcomings of <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/generative-ai/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.computerworld.com/generative-ai/">generative AI</a> (genAI) have been discussed extensively since the technology’s breakthrough in 2022.

<p>Whatever Apple’s long-term plans for satellite connectivity, one facet that cannot be ignored is that its Messages via Satellite system is already saving lives — including among iPhone users affected last week by the horror of Hurricane Helene.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The aftermath of Helene</strong></h2>



<p>While there seems no end to all the bad news playing out worldwide at this time, a sizable chunk of the United States was particularly impacted by Helene. When that storm hit, it wiped out power grids and cell service, wrecked infrastructure and took scores of lives across several US states. The hurricane wiped out communications for inland, leaving victims stranded wi

<p>Microsoft’s ambitious collaboration app, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-loop" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft Loop</a>, includes shared workspaces as well as portable content snippets called Loop components. These components can be shared and embedded in multiple Microsoft 365 apps.</p>



<p>What makes Loop so useful is that those shared components can be updated by multiple collaborators, and the contents of these components stay in sync no matter where they’re embedded. One person could edit a component in an Outlook email, while another edits it in a Teams chat, and the latest changes appear in both places.</p>

<p>Like many small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs), ‘JPX Construction’ didn’t see itself as a potential target for a ransomware attack.</p>



<p>It wasn’t a high-profile organisation. It didn’t seem to hold much high-value data. So, when the financial director turned on her PC to find a black screen with a ransomware message, it came as a painful shock.</p>



<p>That’s the premise of a dramatic new film that takes viewers inside the events of a fictionalised ransomware attack based on true events.</p>
