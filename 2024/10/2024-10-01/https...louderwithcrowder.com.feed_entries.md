So while it’s unsurprising they did nothing significant this weekend for the people of North Carolina, you would think they would at least act like they are doing something but the best they could be bothered to do was pretend to sign blank papers and lie about taking a phone call at the beach. </p><p>Their lack of a response was so abysmal that Scott Jennings called them out.</p><div class="rm-em

The best Kamala could do was take a photo in front of papers that probably didn’t say anything and pretend her headphones were plugged into her phone. So while this administration vows to send billions overseas to fund wars in places you have probably never been, Americans' livelihoods have been destroyed, as one of the most destructive natural disast

	Yes, everyone here at the Louder with Crowder Dot Com website is well aware that Charlamagne Tha God is not a conservative and sure as hell isn't a Trump supporter. However, when out of all the annoying political ads shown during football, it's a Trump attack ad that not only stands out to him, but he agrees with it; it's worth pointing out. Progressives can have "Republicans" like Ana Navaro and Alyssa Farah Griffin yakking it up with the other shrill harpies on

This is the part where polls start to resemble Rorschach tests. You can see whatever you want in them. Plus, there are so many topline results that function as little more than clickbait.
