This isn&#8217;t a good look for the Las Vegas Metro PD, even if it&#8217;s completely supported by court precedent. No matter how often law enforcement agencies sling around the phrase &#8220;protect and serve,&#8221; they have almost no legal obligation to do either of those things. Sometimes a &#8220;failure to intervene&#8221; allegation might undermine a cop&#8217;s [&#8230;]

Culminating a deal that&#8217;s been rumored about for the better part of the last twenty years, Dish Network and DirecTV have struck a new merger in a bid to try and remain relevant. It&#8217;s not going to help. The deal involves DirecTV acquiring Dish for one dollar, in addition to $9.75 billion in Dish’s debt. [&#8230;]

We have a hero in our midst, one that is responsible for freeing up the term &#8220;superhero&#8221; from its previous trademark imprisonment. If you don&#8217;t recall, Scott Richold is a British comic artist who produces the Superbabies line of comic books. Richold applied for a trademark for his comic only to find it opposed by [&#8230;]

Forget &#8220;defund the police.&#8221; Let&#8217;s just get rid of the sheriffs. Or, at the very least, change how the job is handled. Sheriffs are elected, which means a lot of sheriffs are less interested in providing good law enforcement than ensuring they&#8217;ve catered to their voting bases enough that they&#8217;ll be re-elected. And since it&#8217;s [&#8230;]

In this stupid partisan world we live in, the MAGA world has decided that simply accurately explaining that the First Amendment does not allow for the suppression of speech (which is a good thing!) is somehow a call for abolishing the First Amendment. This isn’t even “blaming the messenger.” It’s misinterpreting the messenger and demanding [&#8230;]

Analysts (and Musk himself) had been&#160;quietly noting&#160;for a while that Starlink satellite broadband service would consistently lack the capacity to be disruptive at any real scale. As it usually pertains to Musk products, that analysis was generally buried under product hype. A few years later, and Starlink users are facing&#160;obvious slowdowns&#160;and a steady parade of [&#8230;]

There&#8217;s that well known adage that if you want to teach a child not to touch a hot stove, just let them touch it once and that will be all the teaching needed to have them never do so again. Whoever came up with that saying obviously has never met my children, for starters. And [&#8230;]
