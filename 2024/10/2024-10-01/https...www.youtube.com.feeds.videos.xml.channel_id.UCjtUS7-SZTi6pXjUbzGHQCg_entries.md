Why Does The US Suck at Wind? Go to https://surfshark.com/undecided for 4 extra months of Surfshark. The U.S. wind turbine industry kinda blows. The past few years haven’t been great for turbines in the States. 2023 was particularly nasty. The weather got us off to a bad start, offshore wind saw basically no progress whatsoever, clocking in at zero installations, and that’s all against a backdrop of multiple high-profile accidents and escalating public animosity. Wind energy is nowhere near the level of deployment we’ve seen with solar. But how do these problems fit into a larger context? Are they temporary or to be expected? And where are the rays of hope?
