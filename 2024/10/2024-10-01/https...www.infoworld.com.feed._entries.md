<p>The PyTorch Foundation, makers of the <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2335194/what-is-pytorch-python-machine-learning-on-gpus.html">PyTorch machine learning framework</a>, has launched <a href="https://github.com/pytorch/ao">torchao</a>, a PyTorch native library that makes models faster and smaller by leveraging low-bit dtypes, sparsity, and quantization. It is a toolkit of techniques that span both training and inference, Team PyTorch said. </p>



<p>Unveiled <a href="https://pytorch.org/blog/pytorch-native-architecture-optimization/">September 26</a>, torchao works with <code>torch.compile()</code> and <code>FSDP2</code> over most PyTorch models on Hugging Face. A library for custo

<p><a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2336682/jdk-23-the-new-features-in-java-23.html">Java Development Kit (JDK) 23</a> having arrived September 17, work already has begun on <a href="https://openjdk.org/projects/jdk/24/">JDK 24</a>, with two features so far proposed for the release: warnings to prepare developers for future restrictions on the use of <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2518132/openjdk-plan-calls-for-restricting-jni-usage.html">JNI (Java Native Interface)</a> and a late barrier expansion for the G1 garbage collector. A multitude of other features, including many already in preview in JDK 23, also are possible for inclusion.</p>

<p>The conductor of my choir famously tells us singers, “I only want everything all the time.” Well, as a developer, my mantra for code editors and IDEs (integrated development environments) is exactly that: I only want everything all the time. What’s “everything” in this context in 2024? It has to be fast enough not to get in my way. It has to be able to support my software development life cycle in all the programming languages that I write, with, at a minimum, syntax highlighting, and preferably some in-line auto-completion and syntax checking. And it has to be able to act as my <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2338608/review-codewhisperer-bard-and-copilot.html">pair programmer</a> at

<p>Microclouds can have many names and offer many features. They can be hosted by a regional cloud provider or specialize in a specific use case, such as <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2337126/need-gpus-take-a-look-at-microclouds.html">the rise of GPU cloud providers</a> focusing on the exploding AI space. They could even be clouds that don’t have an international presence and are instead <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2338181/sovereign-clouds-are-becoming-a-big-deal-again.html">located in a single country</a>.</p>

<p>As AI models become increasingly commoditized, the data required to train and fine-tune them has never been more critical. While procuring high-quality data is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/17/24075670/reddit-ai-training-license-deal-user-content">expensive</a> and raises <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/medical-records-artificial-intelligence-privacy-66bc4d9e">privacy concerns</a>, there is a powerful alternative that companies like <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/gemma/gemma-report.pdf">Google</a> and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/26/cnbc-exclusive-cnbc-transcript-jpmorgan-chase-chairman-ceo-jamie-dimon-speaks-with-cnbcs-leslie-picker-on-fast-money

<p>If all code is legacy code, then we are all maintainers. I carry an image in my head of a vast sea of silent, diligent, dedicated coders who silently maintain much of the code that makes the world go round. I carry this image because I am one of those coders. </p>



<p>For the better part of the last 15 years, I have either directly maintained 30-year-old code or managed developers who did. And I don’t think I’m alone. I figure for every developer discussing cutting-edge topics on Hacker News, there are seven or eight of us out there, quietly grinding away at keeping that inventory system running on the current version of Windows, despite large chunks of the running code having originally been

<p>JRuby, which dates back to 2001 as a <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3687219/whatever-happened-to-ruby.html">Ruby language</a> implementation for the <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3272244/what-is-the-jvm-introducing-the-java-virtual-machine.html">JVM</a>, is set to arrive at version 10 shortly after the new year. JRuby 10 promises to be fully compatible with <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2337532/ruby-steps-toward-frozen-string-literals.html">Ruby 3.4.0</a>, a planned update to Ruby that brings changes for frozen string literals and class updates. JRuby 10 will also support Rails 7.1 and later versions. </p>
