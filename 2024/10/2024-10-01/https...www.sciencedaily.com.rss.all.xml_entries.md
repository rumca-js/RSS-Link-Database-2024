## Research provides new insights into role of mechanical forces in gene expression

The genome inside each of our cells is modelled by tension and torsion -- due in part to the activity of proteins that compact, loop, wrap and untwist DNA -- but scientists know little about how those forces affect the transcription of genes. Transcription of a gene begins when RNAP binds to a 'promoter' DNA sequence and ends at a 'terminator' sequence where the mRNA copy is released. The canonical view of termination holds that after releasing the mRNA, RNAP dissociates from the DNA. A team of researchers has demonstrated how force plays a role in an alternative to canonical termination.

Some proteins in the human body are easy to block with a drug; they have an obvious spot in their structure where a drug can fit, like a key in a lock. But other proteins are more difficult to target, with no clear drug-binding sites. To design a drug that blocks a cancer-related protein, scientists took a hint from the protein's paralog, or 'twin.' Using innovative chemical biology methods, the scientists pinpointed a druggable site on the paralog, and then used that knowledge to characterize drugs that bound to a similar -- but more difficult to detect -- spot on its twin. Ultimately, they found drugs that only bound to the protein of interest and not its highly similar sibling.

Discerning whether a nuclear reactor is being used to also create material for nuclear weapons is difficult, but capturing and analyzing antimatter particles has shown promise for monitoring what specific nuclear reactor operations are occurring, even from hundreds of miles away. Researchers have developed a detector that exploits Cherenkov radiation, sensing antineutrinos and characterizing their energy profiles from miles away as a way of monitoring activity at nuclear reactors. They proposed to assemble their device in northeast England and detect antineutrinos from reactors from all over the U.K. as well as in northern France.

Researchers have made a significant step towards enabling women with epilepsy safer access to a common and highly effective anti-seizure medication. Sodium Valproate or valproic acid is widely prescribed for epilepsy and certain mental health conditions, but is considered harmful to use during pregnancy because of links to spinal cord defects and other complications for newborns. A team of organoid experts have identified a drug that may nullify the dangerous side effects.

Everyday experience tells us that light reflected from a perfectly flat mirror will give us the correct image without any deformation. Interestingly, this is not the case when the light field itself is structured in a complex way. Tiny deformations appear. These have now been observed in the laboratory. The results confirm the prediction of this fundamental optical effect made more than a decade ago. They also show how it can be used, for example, as a method for determining material properties.

The genetic confirmation of a suspected diagnosis of 'hereditary colorectal cancer' is of great importance for the medical care of affected families. However, many of the variants identified in the known genes cannot yet be reliably classified in terms of their causal role in tumor formation. Scientists have reassessed the medical relevance of a significant number of unclear variants and thus significantly reduced their number.
