<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I think kickstarter (or crowdfunding) is a great way to fund board games, however, I am quite fed up with the design choices it seems to incentivise. </p> <p>Kickstarter games seem to love quantity over quality. Every board game has to have a ton of plastic intricate models, a bunch of wooden and metal game tokens, several different boards, and many decks of cards. (Also for this post leave it assumed I&#39;m not talking about the extras backers pay more for). </p> <p>I don&#39;t have a problem with plastic models or think they make a game worse (Warhammer shows that they in fact can make a game). However, I get fed up with how constant and omnipresent they are without much thought apart from &quot;This looks cool&quot; and the main reason why it annoys me is because it only serves to inflate the price without increasing the quality of the experience.</p> <p>So many games can serve with just little coloured cubes for troops but instead the price goes

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello all,</p> <p>I am looking to work on an web / mobile app for my own personal development, and I was thinking of making a tool for narrative content and collaboration for campaign board games. I am trying to gauge interest or ideas about such an app and thought to reach out.</p> <p>Think of what Forteller does with the Gloomhaven scenarios. It would be something similar to this but the content will be user-driven. A user with good narration skills can create some audio files of certain campaigns and upload them in the app to keep them organized by game / scenario / outcome etc. </p> <p>These collections could start as private, but the user then could have an option to make them public and open them up for collaboration. If other users like this collection and want to improve them or add scenarios, they can add to the collection.</p> <p>Other features I think of would be browsing, rating, or even set certain collections as &quot;complete&quot; or r

## Racoon Tycoon: Are we doing it wrong?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey All!</p> <p>So my board game group has about a dozen plays of Racoon Tycoon now. It started out fun with people trying a few different things but the last handful of games have all gone the same way: Two or more people amass a large sum of money, people become unwilling to start auctions for railroads, everyone rushes towns, game ends quickly. I just feel like there is some aspect of the rules or strategy that we have to be missing, but I can&#39;t for the life of me figure out what it is. It just seems like such a huge tempo negative to start an auction unless you are sure you are going to win. And since money isn&#39;t worth anything at the end (unless you have the bank), people are willing to throw vast amounts of cash at pretty much any railroad. If anybody has any play advice for the game, I&#39;d love to hear it.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/JDMonet"> /u/JDMonet </a> <br/> <span><a hr
