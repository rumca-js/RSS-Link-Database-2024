<p>This video from “MTT” warmed my heart. And that takes a lot. I learned Pascal on this keyboard. I absolutely loved this keyboard when I first encountered it. But, today, man, what a weird keyboard it is. I mean the arrow-key layout is one thing (up, down, left, right — arranged horizontally). But how about putting the backslash (\) key on the right of the space bar and the backtick (`) key on the left? I mean that’s just crazy. I recall absolutely loving the <em>feel</em> of this keyboard as teenager but I’ve never bothered chasing one down in my adult life because I know today I could never bear the weird layout. But MTT didn’t just do the lazy thing (buy an ADB-USB adapter), he went the whole nine yards and designed and soldered his own custom parts to turn this 1986 gem into a modern day Bluetooth keyboard. Masterful.</p>

<p>Jason Snell returns to the show to discuss Apple’s September product announcements, and Meta’s Orion prototype AR glasses. Absolutely no baseball talk, almost.</p>

<p>Allen Pike:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As I understand it, my first experience in a self-driving car was typical:</p>

<ul>
<li>Minute 1: “How safe is this? Will it notice that cyclist? What about those construction cones?”</li>
<li>Minute 10: “This is wild. It’s driving so calmly and safely. I love it.”</li>
<li>Minute 20: (Bored, checking my email in the back seat.)</li>
</ul>

<p>It was like a firmware update to my brain.</p>

<p>Imagine how exhilarating subways must have been a century ago — zipping across cities in high-speed underground trains. All technology becomes mundane quickly. It’s kind of amazing when you notice it happening with yourself.</p>

<p>Om Malik, after Apple’s September 9 “It’s Glowtime” event at Steve Jobs Theater:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I decided to become a fly on the wall and chronicle the spectacle
unfolding in front of me. I focused on those who were there to
create content about the devices, not the devices themselves. It
was fun to just float among the crowds with my Nikon Zf and a
40mm lens.</p>

<p>It was a wonderful spectacle — just to bask in this new kind of
raw media energy. Content for the sake of content. Events for the
sake of content. Fog of content. It’s the new way of the world. As
a student of media, I love this chaos and change — because from
chaos and change comes the future.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m linking to this photo essay despite, not because of, the fact that it includes a portrait of yours truly dicking around on his phone in the small room where the media wait for post-event briefings. Steve Jobs Theater is a beautiful and unique space, but there are aspects of the space that are

<p>The Cincinnati Enquirer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Pete Rose, the Cincinnati native who became baseball’s all-time
hits leader as well as one of the most divisive figures in the
sport’s history, died Monday, <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2024/09/30/pete-rose-dead/">according to a TMZ report</a>,
which was confirmed by his agent, Ryan Fiterman. He was 83.</p>

<p>After reaching the pinnacle of the sport he loved, Rose was banned
from baseball in 1989 for gambling while manager of his hometown
Reds. That came just four years after Rose had broken Ty Cobb’s
hit record, a mark that still stands. He is MLB’s all-time hits
leader with 4,256.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even putting aside the betting scandal, Rose was, by nearly all accounts, <a href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/34364479/pete-rose-dismisses-sexual-misconduct-questions-phillies-bash-was-55-years-ago-babe">a rotten person</a>. But he was an astonishingly good and captivating baseball player, with a nickname for the ages: Cha
