This week’s Good News comes from American folk/blues artist Chris Smither who recently visited our studios with Radio Heartland. Music has a power unlike any other source. Sometimes nothing else can hit the frequency you need the way music can and in this week's story, Chris Smither shares what song moved him for the better. As a heads up, tonight’s Good News contains themes of substance abuse.  

Substance use disorders can affect anyone. They are serious, but are also preventable and can be treated. It’s OK to need help. You’re not alone. The substance abuse hotline with confidential, free help is 1-800-662-4357.
