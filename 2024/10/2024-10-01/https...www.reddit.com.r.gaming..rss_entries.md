<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>If ever there was an argument to be made that generational cycles could last longer it&#39;s this one. Between very few games being released and the obsession with live service games and endless remasters and remakes, there&#39;s a convincing argument to be made that we should have just stayed in the eighth gen if it meant we get more games being released on a consistent basis. The development time needed for most AAA games nowadays is insane. I hope i get to see Elder Scrolls 6 at some point. Let&#39;s not even talk about Fallout 5.</p> <p>I think this is the gen with the smallest difference in graphical fidelity between gens. There are indeed some lookers, like Hellblade 2 and ff16, but it&#39;s telling that games are still being released cross-gen. The previous gen had gorgeous games like TLOU2 and RDR2 and Doom Eternal, which look really great to this day. Current gen consoles are focusing on performance but i&#39;d rather still be on last gen if

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I just bought a new playstation 5 and not even a week into owning it the playstation network goes down. &quot;Not a problem&quot; I thought to myself I already downloaded a game that&#39;s completely single player( dragon age inquisition). But I couldn&#39;t play it without the internet because Sony needs to check the licence. It says I can change this setting in account settings so I can play offline. One problem, I can&#39;t access account settings offline! I had used a half day off work so I could relax and play video games. But the playstation had become completely useless. In this moment I was glad I insisted on a disc drive when we bought this thing. Because the only thing that worked was a disc version of The Last of Us. So remember when a company says you own what you paid for, they&#39;re lying. Now more then ever we should worry about actually owning our media. Because if the network is down. The money you spent becomes worthless</p> </div><
