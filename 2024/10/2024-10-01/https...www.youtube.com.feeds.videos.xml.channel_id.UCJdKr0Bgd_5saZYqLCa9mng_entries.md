Dave Rubin of “The Rubin Report” talks to Grant Cardone about his thoughts on political decisions that hurt his finances; the reason why he pulled out of New York City real estate deals after Trump’s judgment; why there is no future for blue states like New York and California since businesses are flocking to red states, the business shift to Florida and how states like California are pushing people away; why New York and California might recover when enough people are fed up; how Kamala Harris’ housing policies may crash the housing market; how Cardone navigates business challenges in real estate markets; and much more.
