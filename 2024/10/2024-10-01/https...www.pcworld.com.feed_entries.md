<p>Did you know there are<em> Baldur’s Gate III</em> cartoons? Well, of course there are cartoons — there are some <a href="https://youtu.be/8HqLysSnnlQ">great fan animations all over the web</a>. But I mean official ones, made by Larian with the game’s voice actors? There are and there’s a brand new one celebrating the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2450352/baldurs-gate-iii-adds-native-game-mods-on-pc.html">official game mod tools</a> and mod manager.</p>

<p>VPNs aren’t just useful for keeping your online activities safe and private, they’re also a great way to bypass restrictions on streaming content in other countries. The top VPN providers continue to stay one step ahead of streaming services in a never-ending cat-and-mouse game, ensuring that you always have access to your favorite content no matter where you are.</p>



<p>Given the restrictions that services such as Netflix put in place against VPNs, you need to choose a service that has active compatibility with streaming sites. It’s also a good idea to choose a VPN with a generous global server network so that if one server is down, there are other options available in the same country. I’ve thoroughly tested the top VPNs on the market to see how they fare at unblocking the top streaming sites and curated my recommended favorites in the list below.</p>

<p>Microsoft has discontinued production of the HoloLens 2, apparently ending its love affair with its augmented-reality headset and perhaps the metaverse in general.</p>



<p>UploadVR <a href="https://www.uploadvr.com/microsoft-discontinuing-hololens-2/">cited</a> a Microsoft representative who told the outlet that Microsoft has stopped producing the HoloLens 2. While the company will support the headset until the end of 2027 with security updates, it will stop support in 2028.</p>

<p>A quality monitor arm is one of the best upgrades you can make to your home office setup. A monitor arm gives you more ways to move and position your display/s around your desk, and it can free up usable space on your desk surface. Plus, a monitor arm can make your desk setup look really cool.</p>



<p>The only catch is the price. Most monitor arms worth buying will cost close to $200, and heavy-duty arms capable of holding two large displays are even pricier. The good news is that if you buy a good-quality monitor arm, you’ll likely never need to replace it. That’s why it’s important to choose wisely with your first monitor arm purchase. </p>



<p>To help you with that, we’ve put several popular monitor arms through their paces to find the best of the bunch. Below you’ll find our curated list of recommended monitor arms, with thorough explanations of wh

<p>Have you ever been stuck with a USB-A flash drive that can’t plug into your laptop that only has USB-C ports? Or even vice versa? You usually need some kind of adapter to get around that…</p>



<p>But not if you have this 2-in-1 flash drive with both USB-C and USB-A options. It’s a versatile gadget and it’s worth grabbing one right now because <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-Ultra-Drive-Type-C-Flash/dp/B0CKJB51M8/">the 1TB version is down to $80 on Amazon</a>. That’s a hefty 27 percent off its typical $110 MSRP.</p>



<p>The standout feature of this USB flash drive is that it’s double-ended: one side has a USB-C connector and the other side has a USB-A connector. Simply flip it around to use it with whatever devices you have, and it also has a nifty plastic cap to protect the unused end.</p>

<p>Laptop deals are a dime a dozen, but it’s rare to see an already super-cheap laptop going for even super-cheaper.</p>



<p>That’s what Best Buy is doing with the Asus Vivobook, though. You can get this 14-inch Windows 11 laptop with 8GB of RAM and a 128GB SSD, <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/asus-vivobook-14-laptop-intel-core-i3-1215u-with-8gb-memory-128gb-ssd-quiet-blue/6568805.p">for just $220 at Best Buy right now</a>. That’s almost half off! (It’s <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/204866566114">also being sold on eBay</a> through Best Buy’s official account.)</p>



<p>Normally I wouldn’t recommend anyone run Windows 11 on just 8GB of DDR4 memory, and the 128GB drive is pretty pokey, too. But this laptop has a secret that makes this deal amazing: you can upgrade both of those suckers. Take some screws out of the bottom, pop the panel off, and th

This kind of laptop config usually goes for around $1,500, so this is a real deal for laptop gamers.</p>



<p>What’s good about this laptop? For starters, it’s running an Intel Core i7-13620H processor and it has a decent 16GB of RAM. That’s enough for fast boot times and launch times for most games and apps, and if you want to upgrade it later, you can push it up to 32GB of RAM.</p>



<p>Then there’s the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 graphics card, one of the best you can get without shelling out north of $2,000 on a laptop.

<p>It’s never been easier to get classic games running on your PC, but “easier” is a relative term when it comes to one specific category of classic games. Some titles made in the DOS era (that’s the 1980s for you whippersnappers) go absolutely nuts on anything faster than a Casio watch — so one builder decided to ditch the emulation and just make an ITX motherboard that can run DOS games natively.</p>



<p>The ITX Llama is a do-it-yourself project that puts classic PC hardware into a mini-ITX form factor that can be installed in any current desktop case. It’s a labor of love <a href="https://www.vogons.org/viewtopic.php?t=93480">that began on the Vogons forum</a> (don’t read the poetry, whatever you do) and was manufactured in small batches last year. </p>

<p>Microsoft is beginning to roll out its next feature update of Windows 11, the Windows 11 2024 Update, beginning today. But Microsoft obviously isn’t done yet, and it’s offering a sneak peek at new Copilot experiences which will debut this fall, including Copilot Voice, Copilot Vision, and Copilot Daily, among others.</p>



<p>On the surface, the new additions to Copilot sound similar to multimodal ChatGPT (or GPT-4o) that OpenAI launched earlier this year, where <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2331724/openais-latest-gpt-4o-model-brings-gpt-4-to-users-for-free.html">ChatGPT can now “see”</a> and an <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2468855/advanced-voice-modes-arrival-makes-chatgpt-more-sci-fi-than-ever.html">Advanced Voice feature means that you can have conversations</a> with it.

<p>What’s next for Windows? Microsoft may have just shipped the Windows 11 2024 Update (24H2), but the company is already disclosing its plans for next-gen Windows apps — and there’s some <em>very</em> interesting AI-powered features due by the holidays.</p>



<p>Microsoft disclosed that it is working on several AI additions to Windows and Windows apps: improved Windows search using natural descriptive language, super resolution in Photos, generative fill and erase in Paint, as well as the debut of Recall. All (save Recall) will appear in October as part of the Windows Insider program, with an expected launch in November.</p>



<p>All of these features will depend on the NPU inside of Copilot+ PCs, which will now include PCs that feature Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite processors as well as AMD’s Ryzen AI 300 and Intel’s Lunar Lake. Microsoft also plans several

<p>The big Windows 11 2024 Update (also known as Windows 11 24H2) is both a brand-new operating system but also one that’s been out for several months now. It’s Windows 12 — but it’s also not. And its best features are really reserved for those who have invested in a next-gen Copilot+ PC powered by chips from Qualcomm, Intel, and AMD.</p>



<p>These seeming contradictions are at the heart of Windows 11 24H2, which begins rolling out today in a “phased” rollout that will last several weeks. But <em>when</em> you get it and <em>what</em> you get with it will all depend on whether you own a Copilot+ PC.</p>

<p>Microsoft announced the beginning of the rollout of the Windows 11 2024 Update (version 24H2) today, but it may be a while before you get it.</p>



<p>Microsoft is implementing what it’s calling a “phased rollout” of the Windows 11 2024 Update and the first phase will begin “over the coming weeks,” said John Cable, Microsoft’s vice president of program management, Windows servicing and delivery, in a <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/?p=179067">blog post</a> on Tuesday.</p>



<p>The Windows 11 2024 Update will be available to everyone and not just those who have bought a Copilot+ PC. But Copilot PC+ owners will be among the first to sample new Windows experiences that Microsoft will subsequently launch, with the goal of pushing them out to as many as possible by the 2024 holiday season.</p>

That’s a solid 32% discount off its MSRP of $170.</p>



<p>The Kindle Paperwhite Kids is pretty much the same as an “adult” Kindle Paperwhite in terms of tech, meaning it has a 6.8-inch 300PPI glare-free screen that’s easy on the eyes. It also has 17 LED lights that make it perfect for reading in all lighting conditions.</p>



<p>Furthermore, this e-reader is waterproof and it has a battery that lasts about 10 weeks with active use. That’s long enough to forget when you charged it last and to not be a nuisance at all. And it has 16GB of internal storage, which is

<p>The launch of the new 5000 series has also been scheduled, with Nvidia planning to unveil the graphics cards in just a few months at CES in January 2025. The first RTX 5080 and 5090 graphics cards are expected to be available for purchase in February.</p>



<p>The most important change compared to what we previously knew about the new top-of-the-line RTX 5090 model is an upgraded memory interface for a whopping 32GB of video memory, which is now 512 bits wide (instead of 448 bits). Nvidia has also increased the number of shader units to an incredible 21,760.</p>
