<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Valheim</em> is a fun crafting survival game to play with a group of pals set in the Viking afterlife, and the board game adaptation is off to a great start.

There are no stretch goals for the game, as the developer is choosing to deliver a complete, core experience — but there are some fun goodies that players can pledge for, along with the game itself.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Pidove</strong>, the tiny pigeon Pokémon from Unova, can be found in the wild in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/pokemon-go/38713"><em>Pokémon Go</em></a>. Yes, <strong>Pidove can be shiny</strong> in <em>Pokémon Go</em>!</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Unfezant actually has some stark visual differences between its male and female form. Male Unfezant has that red mask-like plumage on their heads, and female Unfezant doesn’t. This makes it a bit rougher for shiny collectors who may want both of these forms.</p>
