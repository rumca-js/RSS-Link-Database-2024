The limestone mountain range that traverses huge lengths of Lebanon lent the country not just its name but beauty, diversity – and a combustible political culture that risks being inflamed again as Israeli forces invade.</p><p>For centuries before modern Lebanon was established, its mountains were a natural barrier to invading armies. For the region’s religious minorities – especially Christians and Druze – they became a sanctuary. Ensconced in remote mountain villages, the kaleidoscope of communities that would eventually form the Lebanese nation developed distinct identities, histories and anxieties over their own survival.

<p><strong>Vivian Beaumont Theater, New York</strong></p><p>The Oscar-winning actor makes a smooth transfer to Broadway but Ayad Akhtar’s play is a mixed bag of insight and exhaustion</p><p>The writer Jacob McNeal is, among other things, a bestselling and influential novelist, an esteemed winner of the Nobel prize for literature, a writer with style consistent and public enough to serve as a prompt for Chat GPT. From another view: a narcissistic cad, a terrible father, a lonely drunk. People argue whether he’s a genius, a fraud, an iconoclast. After nearly two hours with him, it’s not clear which. Though mesmerizingly brought to life by Robert Downey Jr in Ayad Akhtar’s muddled and occasionally poignant new play of the same name, McNeal remains more reflection than character – a projection of success, an outlet for anxieties over artificial intelligence, a cipher to destabilize one’s view of reality.</p><p>All of these angles offer fertile material for a play of ideas, and to Akhtar’s

It has come to this column’s attention that, in recent years, some sections of the global rugby union community have not always given the Springboks sufficient credit. Instead of Rassie Erasmus being portrayed as a spiritual leader and latter-day saint there has been undue focus on his odd home videos and comments about match officials. Photos of Eben Etzebeth looking comically scary have not been matched by an equal number of articles proclaiming him to be tougher than Alun Wyn Jones, Martin Johnson and Colin Meads combined. And if Ireland, say, had won two consecutive World Cup titles, the subsequent media coverage might have been a touch more reverential.

And now 50 years later, when it’s rightly placed on the shortest of shortlists for the greatest horror films ever made, the film’s ambience still blankets American culture, the low hum (and occasional random shriek) of media malevolence.</p><p>The first voice belongs, incredibly, to future star John Larroquette, who narrates the opening scroll with newsreel gravitas. “The film which you are about to see is an account of the tragedy which befell a group of five youths,” begins the

<p>The author inhabits the perspective of five figures, from Malcolm X to footballer Justin Fashanu, in this lyrical account of their lives, a thrilling affront to the archives that exclude them</p><p>If there is one thing that all historians must make peace with, it is that it is hard, often impossible, to know how people in the past felt. Historical fiction has the upper hand in its ability to render the complex yet plausible emotions and motivations of historical figures. Categorised by the publisher as creative nonfiction, Ekow Eshun’s <em><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/the-strangers-9780241472026/">The Strangers</a></em> is foremost a work of imagination that sits somewhere between history and fiction.

<p>Vintage-car driver is chased through New Mexico by a small-town sheriff in Lawrence Jacomelli’s snappily shot debut</p><p>Kicking off with tearaway Bobbie (Britni Camacho) zooming across the New Mexico badlands in her vintage Ford back to her no-good boyfriend, this film rides a two-lane blacktop straight for the heart of classic Americana. British director Lawrence Jacomelli dons the appropriate outlaw squint for this cat-and-mouse thriller – one that’s capable of picking out a sharp composition, too – but ultimately his debut is too disjointed to hit top gear.</p><p>Ignoring her sister’s warnings about reconciling with her violent partner, Bobbie stops for petrol and brushes off the skeezy pestering of Sheriff Bilstein (John Schwab), but the purse-lipped lawman picks her up down the road for speeding and supposedly damaging his siren. They cut a deal for her to reimburse him for the damage – and our suspicions that something dodgy is going down are confirmed back at the gas stati
