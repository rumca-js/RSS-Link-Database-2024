Throne and Liberty, originally an MMORPG released in South Korea, is finally making its way into western markets through Amazon Games.

Take, for instance, Laura, a young girl who remains a crucial part of James’ journey through the town of Silent Hill, Maine from beginning to end, appearing every now and then and usually going hand in hand with important story revelations.

The PlayStation 3 has sold almost 88 million copies since launch, becoming one of the most successful consoles ever. It's easy to forget just how scuffed the initial launch was, but with time, it would amass a pretty strong collection of titles.

The generation saw new IPs like inFamous, Grid, and Dragon Age alongside the continuation of series like Gran Turismo and Uncharted. God of War and Metal Gear Solid finally received their highly-anticipated conclusions, cementing their legacy once and for all (even if they would receive follow-ups).

Overall, there's plenty to choose from. Check out 15 of the best PS3 titles that are worth playing.
