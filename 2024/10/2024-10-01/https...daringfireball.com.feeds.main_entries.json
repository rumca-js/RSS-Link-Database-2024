And that takes a lot. I learned Pascal on this keyboard. I absolutely loved this keyboard when I first encountered it. But, today, man, what a weird keyboard it is. I mean the arrow-key layout is one thing (up, down, left, right\u2009\u2014\u2009arranged horizontally). But how about putting the backslash (\\) key on the right of the space bar and the backtick (`) key on the left? I mean that\u2019s just crazy. I recall absolutely loving the <em>feel</em> of this keyboard as teenager but I\u2019ve never bothered chasing one down in my adult life because I know today I could never bear the weird layout. But MTT didn\u2019t just do the lazy thing (buy an ADB-USB adapter), he went the whole nine yards and designed and soldered his own custom parts to turn this 1986 gem into a modern day Bluetooth keyboard.
