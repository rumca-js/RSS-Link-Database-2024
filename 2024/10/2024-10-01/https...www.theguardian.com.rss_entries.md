<p>Port of London authority to reopen scheme with waiting list, after surge in popularity of exploring riverbank for treasure</p><p>Whether fuelled by social media or prompted by the Covid lockdowns, the years between 2019 and 2022 saw a huge surge in interest in mudlarking on the foreshore of the River Thames in London.</p><p>The practice of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/sep/20/mudlarking-thames-unlocks-london-secret-riches">exploring the riverbank for archaeology</a> is permitted only with a permit from the Port of London authority (PLA), which owns much of the shoreline. But so dramatic was the growth in demand for permits – from 200 applications in 2018-19 to more than 5,000 three years later – that the port suspended the scheme in 2022 to “protect the integrity and archaeology of the foreshore”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/02/thames-mudlarking-permits-to-be-issued-again-but-capped-to-protect-site">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The hit finance drama returns with the pedal to the metal. The opening episode is bedlam, burning through big events you’d expect of a season finale – and it ends with everything on fire</p><p>Mickey Down and Konrad Kay, creators and writers of Industry, are in a rare position both perilous and blessed. Their show, about young Londoners working at the brutal end of the financial sector, is a sleeper hit. More and more people have learned to speak its singular language and now, with the arrival of season three, Industry has the floor. The spotlight burns.</p><p>Happily, its comeback episodes suggest this is the moment Down and Kay have been planning for all along. Industry returns with the pedal pressed down, with all the things that make it great intensified and sharpened.

<p>The Champions League has a habit of inflicting these inglorious episodes on Celtic. It is difficult to shake the notion that this big fish simply cannot swim when removed from its small domestic pond. Borussia Dortmund toyed with and teased their visitors in a match that was over as a contest long before the half-time whistle blew. The Germans have won two out of two in this new format, having been barely tested over 180 minutes. They will have aspirations of equalling last season’s memorable tournament run.</p><p>Suddenly there is pressure on Celtic’s upcoming trip to Atalanta. The paucity of their showing here undermined what had been a widespread sense Celtic were better equipped for the Champions League than at any point in recent seasons. Theirs was a fragile, error-strewn display.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/01/borussia-dortmund-celtic-champions-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From attending her own Dawn French-hosted funeral to saving women’s lives, the inspirational cancer campaigner’s incredible life is movingly captured in this documentary</p><p>A terminal cancer diagnosis isn’t usually something that makes anyone feel hopeful. TV portrayals, fictional and otherwise, tend to depict the disease as tragic and cataclysmic (which, of course, it can be), with the patient relegated to bed to “battle” the disease from the off. But Kris Hallenga – the focus of the BBC documentary Living Every Second: The Kris Hallenga Story, who was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer at just 23<em> </em>years old – didn’t want her story to unfurl like that. Instead, she decided, she would live harder, fuller and with even more purpose. “She was oozing with life and ideas and she was desperate to make big shit happen,” her twin sister Maren tells the camera. “Wanting to get every ounce out of this life was a way of controlling this disease.”</p><p>For Hallenga, that sense o

For Watkins, Kane is his England captain, a teammate but also, to put it bluntly, the guy he is trying to displace. Kane, of course, is the country’s all-time record goalscorer and a guaranteed starter. But in Dortmund three months ago Watkins replaced Kane to score a superb, instinctive 90th-minute winner against the Netherlands to send England into the Euro 2024 final.</p><p>It was surely the biggest moment of the Aston Villa striker’s career, an extraordinary journey that has taken him from on loan at Weston-super-Mare to the Champions League, in which Watkins and Kane are likely to line up against each other on Wednesday.

<p>Every night, I make up little Rascal’s bed and leave a dog chew on his pillow. What’s so odd about that?</p><p>In the popular imagination, writers often have rock’n’roll lifestyles. Me? Not so much. In fact, I have the world’s most mundane weekday routine. Every morning, about 8.25, I wipe congealed oatmeal off my kid’s face and put her in a stroller. Then I put a lead on my dog (a mutt called Rascal) and walk to daycare with them. Then I walk back home with an empty stroller and my dog.</p><p>This extremely ordinary routine – or at least the second half of it – seems to puzzle people. Surprisingly often, I have had strangers stop me in the street and ask if the empty stroller is for my dog. “No, it’s for my small child, whom I just dropped at daycare,” I will explain. They will nod along, but look as if they don’t <em>quite </em>believe me. “Oh,” they might say. “I thought it was for the dog.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/01/of-course-i-look-like

<p><strong>Chichester Festival theatre<br></strong>This drama about Mick Jagger and Keith Jones’s 1967 drugs bust curiously foregrounds their lawyer’s family issues</p><p>The public outcry that followed the prison sentences of Mick Jagger and Keith Richards in 1967 after a drugs raid on the latter’s country pile is proof that the culture wars are not this era’s invention. The cause célèbre campaign and subsequent overturning of their convictions marked a clash between establishment values, tabloid-engineered moral panic and the rising rock’n’roll generation.</p><p>Justin Audibert’s production of Charlotte Jones’s play foregrounds the band’s story with a fictionalised father-son clash involving the barrister who fought their case. Michael Havers QC (Anthony Calf) is from an illustrious family of lawyers who expects his son to follow suit. But Nigel Havers (Louis Landau) – then a schoolboy, now a veteran performer of screen and stage – has designs on tearing away from tradition to becom

<p>Actually, the answer is not quite as straightforward as you might think …</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/series/how-to-cook-the-perfect----">Guardian perfectionist Felicity Cloake</a> can often be found scaling recipes when testing for her column: “When you’re making six or seven versions of the same thing, sometimes you have to for your own sanity.” Generally speaking, it’s an easy thing to do, too, says Helen Goh, co-author of <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/ottolenghi-comfort-9781785038914/">Ottolenghi Comfort</a> – “assuming you didn’t fail maths, or you have a calculator.” But success really depends on what you’re making, of course. “In baking, for instance, trying to cream a small amount of butter and sugar in a mixer will have the beaters going round and round without making a jot of difference,” Goh says.</p><p>Pasta sauces, meanwhile, are “fair game” in Cloake’s book, as are most stews and soups. That’s not to say you can simply double the ingredient

<p>A braggart absorbed in writing his own online legend with feats of strength can’t carry off being shoved underground for a spiritual experience</p><p>Adi (Ziad Abaza, also the film’s co-scriptwriter) is the kind of loud-mouthed wide boy you’d change seats to get away from in a restaurant. Although married to longsuffering Amira (Priya Blackburn) and the father to adorable little girl Mia (Layla Hady), Adi has been seduced away from his family by the siren-song of the vlogging life and spends all his time making videos for his precious channel. His speciality is supposedly feats of strength and endurance in the vein of recently disgraced Mr Beast, although maybe he cheats when the camera is off.</p><p>One day, in a shisha bar with his best mate/main enabler Maz (Mim Shaikh), Adi meets a fan, Lee (Harry Reid, not to be confused with the former Democratic American senator) who suggests a new challenge. Meet Lee and the circle of Sufi Muslim mystics he hangs with and they’ll arrange fo

<p>So many things could have been worse – apart from the things that could have been better</p><p>I noticed Lime bikes almost as soon as they arrived in London, in 2018, because of the teenagers. Let me explain: it’s possible to hack the rentable ebikes – and when I say “hack”, I mean “not pay for”. You just have to pedal as fast as you can and you’re golden. If you haven’t paid, though, they make a loud clicking noise, which some bystanders find annoying, but I perceive as the soundtrack of naughty teenagers living their best life. I live next to a school and shoals of hoodlums cycle past like a percussion orchestra.</p><p>This is where my problem originated, I think: that casual association between the Lime and the scofflaw, which became even more pronounced after my brother got into an altercation with a police officer who told him off for salmon-cycling (going the wrong way down a one-way street). He was so rude, he told me, that he was amazed he hadn’t been arrested. He put it do

<p>From his most enduring hit inspired by Sinatra to the song that enabled him to stop working for a living, we pick some highlights from the late singer’s long career</p><p>One of the great American songs – evident from those who have covered it, including Janis Joplin, Dolly Parton, Willie Nelson, Johnny Cash and the Grateful Dead – was written by Kris Kristofferson and first a hit for Roger Miller. It’s a perfect road song, inspired by Fellini’s La Strada, and encapsulates Kristofferson’s voice: bruised and desolate, but romantic and hopeful, with a markedly masculine streak. (Kristofferson neither looked nor sounded metrosexual; his sensitivity was not uncomplicated.) It’s hard to imagine a song with such a perfect opening verse (“Busted flat in Baton Rouge … feelin’ near as faded as my jeans”) could deliver on its setup, but Me and Bobby McGee does, with its single devastating line: “Freedom’s just another word for nothin’ left to lose.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/m

And now <strong>Robert Jenrick</strong>, the bookmakers’ favourite, has also made an error serious enough to cost him support.</p><p>Yesterday he released a video claiming that that UK special forces are “killing rather than capturing” terrorists because of fears that European laws would free any detained assailants.
