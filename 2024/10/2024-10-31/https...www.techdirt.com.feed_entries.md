According to some people (you know the people I mean&#8230;), our biggest &#8220;crisis&#8221; is border security. This one guy &#8212; a supposed billionaire with multiple bankruptcies under his belt &#8212; claimed he could solve the problem if he ever got elected. He would &#8220;build the wall&#8221; and make Mexico pay for it. This is stuff [&#8230;]

Sometimes I love a good “mashup” story hitting on two of the different themes we cover here at Techdirt. This one is especially good: Alaska legislators relying on fake stats generated by an AI system to justify banning phones in schools, courtesy of the Alaska Beacon. It’s a mashup of the various stories about mobile [&#8230;]

This is something that should have happened years ago, but I guess we can be grateful it&#8217;s happening now. And part of the reason it&#8217;s finally happening is because of the warrant requirement for obtaining historical cell site location info created by the Supreme Court&#8217;s Carpenter decision.

We’ve noted repeatedly that in the wake of the Sprint T-Mobile merger, wireless carriers&#160;immediately stopped trying to compete on price&#160;(exactly what deal critics had warned the Trump administration would happen when you reduce sector competition).
