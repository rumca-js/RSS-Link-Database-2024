<p>Both teams had stretches of greatness on both sides. Home runs. Clutch hitting in late innings. Freddie Fucking Freeman. Innings of unhittable pitching. There’s no question in my mind these are the two most talented teams in baseball. But one team made a bunch of glaring mistakes, throughout the series (and especially so tonight), and the other team made few mistakes at all.</p>

<p>A well-earned championship.</p>

<p>(At least the Dodgers get to celebrate this at a nice ballpark.)</p>
