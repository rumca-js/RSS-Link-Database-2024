I have a folder with a lot of html, doc, pdf and txt files and I would like to find a way to search inside the files but with the precision or at least close to what something like an online search engine offers. While I can search inside windows I find that it often is not precise, for example if I search the word &quot;home&quot; it also finds words like &quot;homely&quot;, &quot;homer&quot;, etc. or if I search more than a word it oftens returns files with just one of the two or more words.
