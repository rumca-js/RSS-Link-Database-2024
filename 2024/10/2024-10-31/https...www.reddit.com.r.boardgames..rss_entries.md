It was a circular progress through the board type of game, kind of like sorry.

There were also a lot of really old memes like the O REALLY? Owl. </p> <p>Does anyone know the name of this game?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>DC Super Heroes United&#39;s pledge manager closes today. I&#39;ve been going back and forth whether I should get this or not as both me and my wife think we&#39;ll enjoy the game a lot and the minis seems like a joy to paint. However, it costs quite a lot when you factor in CMON&#39;s shipping costs, which costs about the same amount as the pledge in my country.</p> <p>We&#39;re looking at getting: - Super Friends (DC United base game + stretch goals) - Suicide Squad - Escape from Arkham Asylum - Playmat</p> <p>It works out to $379 (of which $190 is shipping)</p> <p>For those with the previous entries of the game, is it worth splashing out on? Does the shipping justify the stretch goals and exclusives?</p> <p>Would love to hear everyone&#39;s thoughts.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Ninja_Badger_RSA"> /u/Ninja_Badger_RSA </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1gg

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey folks! My mom has a custom Super Aggravation board that my dad made her before he passed away this year. For Christmas I want to get her a custom set of replacement cards to go with it. The cards she has now are marked up and have small print that is hard for her to read. I&#39;ll also probably add a few new goofy ones.</p> <p>The problem is I can&#39;t find a list of the cards that normally come with the game online, and I won&#39;t be able to get her to send me pictures of the cards without ruining the surprise. eBay might be an option to get a used game to figure out the cards, but shipping to Canada looks to be pretty expensive.</p> <p><strong>Is there anyone here who owns Super Aggravation and would be willing to send me photos of the cards?</strong> Ideally separated by colour (red/blue). I&#39;d be happy to send you a donation for your time. Cheers!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/jamo

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Ok so I have heard a lot about this game and it looks amazing and I really think that it is definitely something I would love..... But am I seeing the correct prices for this thing? Base game on their website is over 400 dollars with very expensive expansions. I am a big chip theory fan so I understand having premium components but what is it that makes this game cost that much</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/thearchadian"> /u/thearchadian </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1gg5vkc/kingdom_death_monster/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1gg5vkc/kingdom_death_monster/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>My group wants to try Blood on the Clocktower, but before investing the $150 into buying the actual set from the publisher I wanted to see if there was a Print &amp; Play version anywhere to see if we like it enough to buy it? I played it once before years ago and I remember the person who hosted it definitely did not have the actual set but rather a printed (and I think condensed) version they downloaded somewhere. I&#39;m turning up empty on the google though, and I&#39;m not in contact with the person I played it with years ago. Is this available anywhere?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Glittering_Act_4059"> /u/Glittering_Act_4059 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1gg4duj/blood_on_the_clocktower_print_play/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1gg4duj/blood_on_the_clocktower_print_play/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Whenever I want to play a game I don&#39;t know, I need to read the rule book, watch play throughs, and then explain the rule again to my friends and families to finally get started on the game. </p> <ul> <li>this is time consuming</li> <li>people get bored listening to the rules </li> <li>people (including myself) forget rules while we play, after all those hours spent learning the rules</li> </ul> <p>That&#39;s why I wanted to make play-along tutorials either as a YouTube video or website to help people learn faster and get right into playing games. This definitely doesn&#39;t eliminate the need of a rulebook or references at the end of the tutorial to make sure it&#39;s covering all the rules, but I was thinking it could potentially remove barriers for people to start a game. </p> <p>But I wanted to make sure this is a problem people are facing.
