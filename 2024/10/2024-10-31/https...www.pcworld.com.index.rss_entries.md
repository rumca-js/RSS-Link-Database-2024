<p>Microsoft originally intended to delay its controversial Recall feature until October. But on Halloween, Microsoft has confirmed that Recall will be postponed again to avoid becoming the privacy nightmare before Christmas.</p>



<p>Microsoft <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/31/24284572/microsoft-recall-delay-december-windows-insider-testing">told The Verge</a> that Recall has been delayed until December, when it will once again be released to the Windows Insider program. Brandon LeBlanc, one of the co-captains of sorts which heads up the Windows Insider program, told the publication that it needs more time to deliver a “secure and trusted experience.”</p>



<p>Microsoft representatives provided the statement in full to PCWorld.</p>

<p>Slowly but surely, OLED monitor prices are creeping downward. I wouldn’t call them “affordable” just yet, but you can find one from a reliable brand for about half the price they were at a year ago.</p>



<p>Take this 27-inch MSI monitor for example: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/MSI-QD-OLED-27-inch-Response-Adjustable/dp/B0D68C1BVS/">it’s just $530 on Amazon right now</a>. That’s $170 off its regular price.</p>



<p>The MAG 271QPX is on the budget side of things, albeit in the very specific context of a “budget” OLED. But it’s still packed with features that gamers will appreciate. That starts with the 2560×1440 resolution, which is increasingly the “sweet spot” for PC gamers. With a 240Hz refresh rate and 0.03ms response time, you can get ultra-smooth motion for online competitive games and fantastic visuals for single-player games (assuming your PC
