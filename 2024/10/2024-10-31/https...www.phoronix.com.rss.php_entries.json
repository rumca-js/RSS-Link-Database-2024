That's interesting for looking at the new 5th Gen AMD EPYC top-end wares but in comparing to 4th Gen EPYC also means higher core counts at the top-end. In being curious about the core-for-core advantages of 5th Gen EPYC, I managed to get my hands on the AMD EPYC 9655 processors for seeing how that model compares to the prior AMD EPYC 9654 \"Genoa\" flagship model. Here's a look today at how the AMD EPYC 9655 1P/2P 96-core processor compares to the prior EPYC 9654 flagship.", "id": 1423465, "language": "en-us", "link": "https://www.phoronix.com/review/amd-epyc-9655", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 494, "source_url": "https://www.phoronix.com/rss.php", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "AMD EPYC 9655 Benchmarks Show The Terrific Generational Gains With 5th Gen EPYC", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-10-31T09:47:48+00:00", "description": "AMD has been teasing the Ryzen 9000X3D Zen 5 CPUs with 3D V-Cache and today they formally announced the specs of the Ryzen 7 9800X3D processor that will begin shipping 7 November...", "id": 1421982, "language": "en-us", "link": "https://www.phoronix.com/news/AMD-Ryzen-7-9800X3D", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 494, "source_url": "https://www.phoronix.com/rss.php", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "AMD Formally Announces Ryzen 7 9800X3D Specs - Should Be Great For Linux Creators", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-10-31T09:00:00+00:00", "description": "Following the announcement yesterday that Ubuntu 25.04 will default to the -O3 optimization level with GCC for its Debian package builds, Fedora stakeholders have begun debating the merits of switching to the -O3 optimization level or not instead of the existing -O2 optimization level default...", "id": 1421983, "language": "en-us", "link": "https://www.phoronix.com/news/Fedora-Debates-O3-Packages", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 494, "source_url": "https://www.phoronix.com/rss.php", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Fedora Stakeholders Debate Idea Of \"-O3\" Optimized Packages", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-10-31T07:10:00+00:00", "description": "Linus Torvalds merged a patch on Wednesday that he authored that with reworking a few lines of code is able to score a 2.6% improvement within Intel's well-exercise \"will it scale\" per-thread-ops benchmark test case...", "id": 1421146, "language": "en-us", "link": "https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linus-2.6p-Faster-Scale-Patch", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 494, "source_url": "https://www.phoronix.com/rss.php", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Linus Torvalds Lands A 2.6% Performance Improvement With Minor Linux Kernel Patch", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-10-31T06:43:03+00:00", "description": "Intel compiler engineer Feng Zou has upstreamed AMX-FP8 support into the LLVM compiler stack.
