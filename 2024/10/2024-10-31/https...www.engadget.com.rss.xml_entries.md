<p>We’re still officially in “teaser trailer” territory for the new season of Squid Game but a lot of interesting details just dropped in the latest one for season two.</p>
<p>The new trailer takes us deeper into the games as Seong Gi-hun, played by Lee Jung-jae, returns to the island presumably to take down the rich tyrants and the Front Man from the inside of the tournament. Seong is back as a player (Player 456 again, to be specific) and at least two of the games from the last season will be part of the new one, including “Green Light” and the dalgona cookie cutting challenge. This time, however, they have an experienced contestant in the sea of green, bloodied jumpsuits who can tell them how to avoid the pitfalls (figuratively and literally if the Mirror Bridge returns).</p>

<p>Hydrogen-powered vehicles haven’t really caught on as an alternative means of eco-friendly transportation. Hyundai, however, hopes to fix that with a bigger investment in the technology and its newest hydrogen-powered concept SUV called the <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.hyundainews.com/en-us/releases/4283"><ins>Initium</ins></a>.</p>
<p>Hyundai announced it plans to start production on the hydrogen SUV in the first half of next year. The Initium can run approximately 404 miles on a single refueling and can also run on electric power as a backup that can be recharged from a household electricity supply. The vehicle will also make its public debut at the LA Auto Show and Auto Guangzhou in China next month. It’s not yet confirmed where the cars will be available when they go on sale so a US launch isn’t guaranteed.</p>

<p>Google is bringing its Gemini AI assistant into more of its software suite, announcing several new features for Google Maps. Users looking for ideas about places to go in Maps can now ask conversational questions about the type of location they want and receive answers from Gemini. Maps can also use AI to respond to deeper queries about a specific locale. When you're looking at a location on Maps, Gemini can also provide a summary of reviews. These AI-powered features will roll out to the Maps app on Android and iOS beginning this week.</p>

<p><em>The US presidential election is in its final stretch. Before election day on November 5, Engadget is looking at where the candidates, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, stand on the most consequential tech issues of our day.</em></p>
<p>While the environment and climate change are standard fare for elections, the 2024 campaign has put a surprising amount of focus on EVs. Cars and trucks are some of the biggest contributors to global warming, spewing millions of tons of greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere every year. So it’s no shock many believe transitioning from traditional combustion engine vehicles to electric will be key to reining in climate change. Of course, an electric car is only as clean as the energy used to charge its batteries, so the Biden administration has also put a lot of effort into expanding clean-energy initiatives in the US. Kamala Harris is widely expected to continue Biden’s work promoting EV adoption and clean energy technology. While Donald Trump has,

<p>Nintendo has launched its own <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/switch/online/nintendo-switch-online/nintendo-music/">music streaming service</a> that caters to fans of its games, including Mario and <em>Animal Crossing</em>. Fans will be able to listen to their favorite game tracks on their phones through the new Nintendo Music app, which has a user interface that pretty much looks like Spotify. The tracks are organized by game, so people can play the whole OST for specific titles if they want, but they can also listen to character playlists like a selection of songs performed by <em>Animal Crossing&#39;s</em> K.K. Slider.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If they&#39;re in the mood for certain songs, they can hit up one of the pre-made themed playlists, which put together tracks for themes like &quot;boss battle&quot; and &quot;victory.&quot; The app offers mood playlists, as well, that groups tracks with similar vibes, such as soft, relaxing songs for bedtime listening.

<p>Dating apps are a constant battle to find just one person that you might click with for more than a few meet ups. Unfortunately, so much of the experience focuses on physical appearance rather than learning much about the other person — a dynamic that is hard to overcome on an app. <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/bumble-wants-users-to-report-ai-generated-images-203627777.html">Bumble</a> is making the latest attempt to do so by allowing users to search for matches based on their interests.</p>
<p>Users can access the new tool by clicking &quot;narrow your search&quot; and then &quot;advanced filters.&quot; Then they can  choose &quot;filter by your interests.&quot; Each user can only include up to five interests on their profile, so there&#39;s a risk of someone not having picked a mutual interest even if they do like it — and Bumble just added over 30 new options. But, at the same time, people can&#39;t click all of them in hopes of connecting, rather t

<p>Finally, a color Kindle. Amazon, the dominant force in ereaders, finally brought color eink to its series of devices — and we’ve reviewed it. The Kindle Colorsoft is a solid premium ereader,  ideal for readers of comics and graphic novels. The company has upgraded page-turn speed and a handy pinch-to-zoom function makes it easier to fully enjoy detailed images.</p>
<p>But at $280, it’s expensive. More expensive, even, than rival color ereaders. However, it’s hard to argue against the convenience and ubiquity of the Kindle ecosystem. The library is seemingly endless (with regular discounts on books and titles you plan to read), supplemented by Prime Reading and Kindle Unlimited. If you’re tempted, check out our <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/kindle-colorsoft-review-the-missing-link-in-amazons-ereader-lineup-131529685.html">detailed review</a> and comparisons with other ereaders.</p>

## The best live TV streaming services to cut cable in 2024

<p>You basically have three options for watching live TV at home: Hook up a digital antenna, pay for a cable subscription or sign up for a live TV streaming service. The content you get through a digital antenna is free, but limited to your local broadcast networks (ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC and PBS). Cable has historically been more expensive than live streaming services, though the gap is narrowing as <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-tv-raises-prices-to-an-outrageous-73-per-month-182517379.html">nearly</a> <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://blog.philo.com/philo-adds-amc-and-new-package-changes/">every</a> <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/get-hulu--live-tv-for-50-a-month-before-the-upcoming-price-hike-kicks-in-131516358.html">streamer</a> has <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/01/12/fubo-tv-price-increase-unlimited-dvr/">raised</a> its <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.digitaltrends.co
