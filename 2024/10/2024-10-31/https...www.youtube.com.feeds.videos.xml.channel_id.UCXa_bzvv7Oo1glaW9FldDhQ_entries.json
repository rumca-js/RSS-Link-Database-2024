Silent Hill, Resident Evil, Amnesia, Clock Tower, the list goes on. But what about multiplayer? We've seen titles like The Outlast Trials make an impact over the past year. However, one of the most popular, Phasmophobia, still endures and is out now on consoles.\n\nWhat makes the experience so intriguing over others is learning about each ghost type. As part of a ghost-hunting crew, you must utilize various tools - from cameras and UV lights to spirit boxes and ghostwriting - to identify them. Each ghost has different traits, and as the investigation proceeds, the paranormal happenings result in mounting tension.\n\nEven if it's a trial-and-error process (without looking up guides, that is) and the lobby browser system could be a lot better, the sheer terror that Phasmophobia instils is refreshing in this day and age.", "id": 1424131, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_f9D6bWIgQ", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 129, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/U_f9D6bWIgQ/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Phasmophobia PS5 Early Access Review - The Final Verdict", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-10-31T15:30:02+00:00", "description": "November 20th marks the release of Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl to PC and Xbox Series X|S and this upcoming open-world survival shooter has been a long time coming, it having been first announced way back in 2010 before being dissolved and revived. \n\nDeveloper GSC Game World have shuttered and re-emerged in that time too, but the change of leadership at the Ukrainian studio (now relocated to Czechia) has done nothing to disillusion those expecting a sci-fi shooter. \n\nStalker 2 looks fantastic, it\u2019s evocative, decrepit world replete with hostility doesn\u2019t care about the player.
