<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>As a kid I had a C128, and a couple of C64 computers...then went into the PC world. I never owned an Amiga in spite of always wanting one. Recently, someone gave me a 1987 Amiga 500. For the most part I have everything where I want it. I have a GoTek for ADF images, I have Emu68 running on a Pistorm and RTG graphics enabled and working. Where I am struggling now is where I see a lot of people struggling... what is the best way to get larger things onto the Amiga 500 without networking? </p> <p>Using Emu68 I am not using HDF files. </p> <p>I do not see any way to use the USB ports on the Raspberry Pi for Amiga transfers. </p> <p>I cannot fit some of the things I want to copy over into an ADF. I assume there is some way to split these files on floppies and then recombine then on the Amiga, but have no idea tbh. </p> <p>The PC I own does not have a serial port, so I cannot do a straight null modem cable. I was looking at this, but I am not sure if this
