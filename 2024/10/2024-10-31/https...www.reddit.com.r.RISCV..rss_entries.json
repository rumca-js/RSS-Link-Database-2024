We shared a great conversation, and in the end I was given a gift - Muse Pi V20 dev board. Equipped with Spacemit M1 8571 RISC-V SoC, 8 GB of RAM and 32 GB of eMMC storage. It came preloaded with Ubuntu 23.10.</p> <p>This past few days I wanted to play around with it, but since 23.10 is EoL, I don&#39;t have many options, so I wanted to put at least 24.04 on it. However, I can&#39;t seem to find an OS image anywhere. Not on DC website, not on Canonical website, not even on Spacemit website. I can only find some weird BinabuOS, which is... well I don&#39;t really trust it.</p> <p>Can you help me? Or at least point me in the right direction? I have some experience with SBCs, like Raspberry Pi, but this is my first encounter with RISC-V.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Leniwcowaty\"> /u/Leniwcowaty ", "id": 1422325, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1ggfj4g/where_can_i_find_os_image_for_my_board_muse_pi_v20", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 471, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Where can I find OS image for my board - Muse Pi V20?", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-10-31T12:06:18+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;m having trouble with a task where I need to load a 32-bit unsigned integer into a register.

However, there doesn\u2019t seem to be a direct instruction for loading 32-bit unsigned integers. The <code>lw</code> instruction loads 32 bits but treats the value as signed. The <code>lhu</code> and <code>lbu</code> instructions are not suitable for 32-bit values either.</p> <p>I also tried loading two <code>lhu</code> values, shifting one of them, and then OR-ing them together, but I still ended up with -1.</p> <p>Is there a way to properly load a 32-bit unsigned integer into a register?</p> <p>Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Expensive-Quiet-5073\"> /u/Expensive-Quiet-5073 </a> <br", "id": 1421399, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1ggcvqj/issue_with_loading_32bit_unsigned_integer_into", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 471, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Issue with Loading 32-bit Unsigned Integer into Register", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-10-31T07:38:29+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I am looking for a RISC-V free open source model which will can connect to debugger and help in debugging s/w.
