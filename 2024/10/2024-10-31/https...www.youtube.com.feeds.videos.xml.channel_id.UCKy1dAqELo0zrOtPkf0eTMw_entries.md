In today's Daily Fix:
Insomniac's Wolverine game has lost its Creative Director, Brian Horton, as he moves from the upcoming Marvel game to take charge of Microsoft's Perfect Dark. Not much is known of the Wolverine game, aside from a teaser several years ago. The Perfect Dark reboot was announced back in 2020, but has languished in development hell until a new gameplay teaser was revealed earlier this year. Horton's previous credits include directing 2015's Rise of the Tomb Raider, and a short stint at Infinity Ward. In other news, Arkane Austin co-founder has some harsh words for Microsoft. Raphael Colantonio, now head of WolfEye Studios, was asked by PC Gamer what his thoughts were of Arkane Austin's closure. Colantonio called the move 'stupid' and the decision was likely to appease investors and stockholders. And finally, more than 50 million mods have been downloaded by Baldur's Gate 3 players. The game has been out for more than a year, but mod support wasn't added until Patch

This video was originally published on CineFix on October 24, 2017.

For the horror genre more than any other, its staples seem inarguable. The classics are almost MORE classic than classic. So instead of rehashing the same, tired praise or just straight up pretending some more obscure movies are better than the faces on Horror's Mt. Rushmore, we're creating our alternate-universe best list. Here are the 5 best horror movies of all time (if the REAL 5 best didn't exist!)
