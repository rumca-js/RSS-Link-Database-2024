AMD has officially announced its new Ryzen 7 9800X3D CPU with 3D V-Cache ("X3D"), following the R7 7800X3D with major changes to the packaging of the silicon. The R7 9800X3D will be a $480 MSRP CPU, its release date is November 7, 2024, and it will launch on the AM5 socket and existing X670E, X870E, and non-X variant platforms. The 9800X3D follows the Intel Ultra 9 285K launch and will mostly compete against AMD's own prior X3D CPUs, like the 5700X3D or 5800X3D on the AM4 socket and (again) the 7800X3D on AM5. Our full review and benchmarks of the R7 9800X3D will go live closer to launch of the CPU.
