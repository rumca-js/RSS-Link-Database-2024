<p>Vast datacentres are being built worldwide, amid growing concerns about the environmental costs. So should we all be considering a data diet – if not complete digital sobriety?</p><p>Nearly 20 years ago, the British mathematician Clive Humby coined a snappy phrase that has turned into a platitude: “data is the new oil”. He wasn’t wrong. We have an insatiable appetite for data, we can’t stop generating it, and, just like oil, it’s turning out to be bad news for the environment.</p><p>So the Guardian<em> </em>set me a challenge: to try to give a sense of how much data an average person uses in a day, and what the carbon footprint of normal online activity might be. To do that, I tried to tot up the sorts of things I and millions of others do every day, and how that tracks back through the melange of messaging services, social networks, applications and tools, to the datacentres that keep our digital lives going.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/oct/31/concer

<p>A lot of households are not democracies; they’re dictatorships. This may mean voter intimidation and suppression</p><p>Lots of memes and tweets and posts and videos are popping up, assuring women that they can keep their votes secret from their husbands and boyfriends. The unspoken assumption is that lots of women are bullied, intimidated or controlled by their partners, specifically in straight couples when she wants to vote for Harris and he supports Trump. The messages assure these intimidated voters that they can vote in peace and privacy at a polling place. But a lot of Americans now vote by mail, which generally means they fill out their ballots at home, where that privacy may not be available.</p><p>On the one hand, I’m glad there’s outreach to those voters.

<p>Politicians have always courted the wealthy, but Elon Musk and co represent a new kind of donor, and an unprecedented danger to democracy</p><p>The concept of “elite overproduction” was developed by social scientist Peter Turchin around the turn of this century to describe something specific: too many rich people for not enough rich-person jobs. It’s a byproduct of inequality: a ton of poor people, sure, but also a superfluity of the wealthy, without enough positions to house them in the influence and status to which they think themselves entitled. In a modern context, that would mean senior positions in the government and civil service, along with the top tier of finance and law, but Turchin tested the hypothesis from ancient Rome to 19th-century Britain.

From their perspective, Halloween is spiritually dangerous: a gateway drug that can lead to full-on devil worship.</p><p>I used to believe that myself but, mercifully, I’ve long since been delivered from the curse of fundamentalism and the church I lead now actively embraces Halloween. So, each year, we throw open the doors of our none-more gothic building and invite the hundreds of little witches, vampires and werewolves who are already out trick or treating in the village to come in and take part in further fun activities such as apple-bobbing, a slimy lucky dip and (my favourite) spooky stories in the graveyard (by which I mean <a hr

<p>New Zealand chief executive Mark Robinson wants rugby union to reinvent itself with the game’s future up for grabs</p><p>Modern rugby union turned 30 last month. It was in the autumn of 1994 that Louis Luyt, president of the South African Rugby Union, announced that the game would turn professional after his country had hosted the World Cup the following year. Luyt was the first significant figure in the sport to say out loud what everyone else was only talking about in whispers. He was right. It took another 12 months, the actual anniversary of the International Rugby Board meeting at which the decision to go pro was made falls next August, but once Luyt had opened the box there was no closing it again.</p><p>Thirty years is no time. Rugby is at once so old that no one’s even quite sure exactly when it was first played, and so young that it’s still figuring out what it wants to be when it grows up. “We’re still very new relative to a lot of other professional sports,” says Mark R

Now Grant is making his horror debut (if we don’t include his appearance in Ken Russell’s The Lair of the White Worm from 1988) and does it with typical insouciance and cheek, starring in a verbose and disturbing chamber piece about religion from writer-directors Scott Beck and Bryan Woods; it feels as if George Bernard Shaw wanted to make a scary movie without songs inspired by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/feb/06/the-book-of-mormon-review-a-visionary-musical-masterpiec
