There’s a misconception that in order to build a hard tech company you need billions of dollars to even create an MVP. But that’s not always the case. Take Astranis for example.

We visited Astranis co-founders John Gedmark and Ryan MckLinko to find out how they pulled it off and what lessons they have for founders who want to build a hard tech company of their own.
