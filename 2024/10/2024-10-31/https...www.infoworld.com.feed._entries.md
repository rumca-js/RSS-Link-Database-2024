<p>Software vendors’ pitches are evolving, with  agentic AI beginning to supplant generative AI in their marketing messages. Rather than just generating code or content for human review agentic AI will, they say, follow instructions, make decisions, and take actions much as a human worker would, without human intervention.</p>

<p>Aspect-oriented programming (AOP) is a programming style that allows you to more easily manage the cross-cutting concerns in your application, meaning those concerns such as authentication or logging that cut across many parts of the app. In essence, AOP is a programming paradigm that enables you to avoid duplicating code and to keep your application easily adaptable to changes.</p>



<p>By taking advantage of AOP, you can increase the modularity of your application through the separation of concerns, as well as reduce code clutter and improve the readability and maintainability of your code.</p>



<p>It should be noted that AOP does not replace object-oriented programming (OOP) in any way. R
