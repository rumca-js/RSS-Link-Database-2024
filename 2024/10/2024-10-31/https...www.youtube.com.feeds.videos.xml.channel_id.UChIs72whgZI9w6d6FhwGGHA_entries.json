The R7 9800X3D will be a $480 MSRP CPU, its release date is November 7, 2024, and it will launch on the AM5 socket and existing X670E, X870E, and non-X variant platforms. The 9800X3D follows the Intel Ultra 9 285K launch and will mostly compete against AMD's own prior X3D CPUs, like the 5700X3D or 5800X3D on the AM4 socket and (again) the 7800X3D on AM5. Our full review and benchmarks of the R7 9800X3D will go live closer to launch of the CPU.\n\nLearn about how X3D came to be originally in this interview: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RTA3Ls-WAcw\nWatch our prior AMD Lab Tour here for more technical details about what AMD does in general: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H4eg2jOvVw\n\nThe best way to support our work is through our store: https://store.gamersnexus.net/\n\n", "id": 1424394, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amQOwllDXWE", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 428, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UChIs72whgZI9w6d6FhwGGHA", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/amQOwllDXWE/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "AMD Responds to Intel: Ryzen 7 9800X3D Price, Specs, & Major Changes", "vote": 0}]
