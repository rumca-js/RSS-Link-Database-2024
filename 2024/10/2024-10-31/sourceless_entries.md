Relief-type cultural heritage objects are commonly found in many historical sites worldwide, but often suffer from varying levels of damage and deterioration. Traditional methods for image reconstruction require extensive manual labor and specialized knowledge. Now, researchers have developed a novel neural network model that can reconstruct these reliefs as three-dimensional digital images from old photographs containing their pre-damage information. This innovative technology paves the way for accurate digital preservation of valuable cultural heritage objects.

When light conditions rapidly change, our eyes have to respond to this change in fractions of a second to maintain stable visual processing. This is necessary when, for example, we drive through a forest and thus move through alternating stretches of shadows and clear sunlight. In situations like these, a corrective mechanism is required. Such a corrective 'gain control' mechanism exists in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, where it acts directly downstream of the photoreceptors.
