We often hear that physical media, DVDs, Blu Rays, and all that is on the way out. But honestly, I think it still has a chance. Kind of. 

New information has come out about buying habits for consumers regarding physical media with video games, and its genuinely surprising, at least to me.

For all the talk of how its the end of physical media, and how the manufacturers are clearly pushing for an all digital future, I think it would actually be a huge mistake to abandon this stuff anytime soon.
