<p>We knew Intel’s quarterly financial results weren’t going to be great, after the company announced a restructuring plan. But when you lose $16.6 billion in a quarter where you made $13.3 billion in revenue, it’s tough to see everything through rose-tinged glasses.</p>



<p>The good news? Intel appears to have pleased investors, as its financial outlook is expected to outperform what Wall Street had hoped for. </p>



<p>In August, Intel said it would <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2416100/intel-will-lay-off-thousands-as-its-rethinks-its-strategy.html">lay off thousands of employees</a> while restructuring the company to cut expenses by $10 billion. Most of the loss is attributable to accountants sloshing red ink over all of the company’s papers: $2.8 billion in restructuring charges and $15.9 billion in depreciation charges, including equipment

<p>These days, you don’t need a full-blown desktop PC or laptop to get your work done — a mini PC will do just fine. Not just fine, but even <em>better</em>. If you don’t need the portability of a laptop or the boundary-pushing power of a top-tier gaming PC, a mini PC might be ideal for you.</p>



<p>And right now, with the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beelink-SER5-Graphics-Computer-Support/dp/B0C2P486GQ/">Beelink SER5 Pro mini PC on sale for $309 at Amazon</a>, down from its original $389 MSRP, it’s a great time to grab one of these bad boys and see how good they are.

<p>Fast charging tech is something we all need for our phones because who has the time to sit around while waiting to hit 100% again?</p>



<p>With a fast charging power adapter, you can cut down your wait time and get right back to using your phone. And right now, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Baseus-Charger-Charging-Compact-iPhone16/dp/B0DG5SXX6M/">this Baseus 45W USB-C wall plug is only $19.49 on Amazon</a>, down from its $30 MSRP. (You’ll have to clip the on-page coupon to get this price.)</p>



<p>This power adapter is compact and speedy, delivering 45W of charging power that’s fast enough to refill more than 50% battery on an iPhone 15 Pro or Samsung Galaxy S24 in just 30 minutes. It features a single USB-C port with Power Delivery, so you can only charge one device at a time — but when it’s this fast, that shouldn’t be an issue.</p>

<p>As you may know, support for Windows 10 expires in just under a year’s time. But if you’re reluctant to upgrade to Windows 11, there’s a new alternative: you can pay a little extra to keep receiving security patches with a new extended consumer support option.</p>



<p>Microsoft has confirmed a <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/?p=179154">consumer version of its Extended Security Updates plan</a>. For $30, you’ll receive “critical” and “important” security updates — basically security patches that will continue to protect your Windows 10 PC from any vulnerabilities. That $30 is for one year’s worth of updates, and that’s the only option at this time. (You won’t be able to re-subscribe at the end, thus ending Windows 10 support.)</p>

<p>Your bank is one of the last places left where you can call up the company and expect to get a human being on the other end, even if you have to wait on hold for a while before you get there.</p>



<p>But newly spotted malware on Android phones might make you think twice about making your next bank call. The trojan app can detect calls to specific banks made from personal phones and reroute them to hackers, with the one making the call none the wiser.</p>



<p>The “FakeCall” or “FakeCalls” malware has been active for a little over two years, according to <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/android-malware-fakecall-now-reroutes-bank-calls-to-attackers/">BleepingComputer</a>, but has recently become more complex and harder to spot.

<p>After confirming that its next-generation Ryzen 9000 X3D processor was headed our way, AMD has now announced its flagship chip: the Ryzen 7 9800X3D, which will benefit from its Zen 5 architecture as well as a new arrangement of its mammoth array of 64MB of cache.</p>

Now, however, we know what AMD will be selling: the Ryzen 7 9800X3D, a 120W part, for $479.</p>

<p>Halloween is the day of all days when you want to be spooked silly. Many people turn to classic horror films to get their annual dose of Halloween frights, but many others are turning to games for that now.</p>



<p>To mark the occasion, the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/free-games">Epic Games Store</a> is once again offering free games that are perfectly fitting for the scariest time of the year… and you can save a ton of cash on one in particular.</p>

<p>Kernel-level anti-cheat software is a contentious issue among gamers. It’s a solution for rampant cheating in online games, but some players see the powerful software as a huge overstep on the PCs they own.</p>



<p>Steam isn’t going to solve this argument, but it might help make the use of these systems more transparent. Games on Steam now have to declare kernel-level anti-cheat on their store pages.</p>

<p>There’s a thought experiment called the “infinite monkey theorem” that says, given an infinite amount of time, a monkey that randomly hits keys on a typewriter will eventually reproduce any body of text, including the complete works of William Shakespeare.</p>



<p>Maybe you’ve heard of this before? The thought experiment is meant to illustrate the principles of probability and how chance can lead to unexpected outcomes. It’s even been referenced in popular culture, from <em>The Simpsons</em> to <em>The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy</em>.</p>



<p>However, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2773186324001014?via=ihub">according to a new study</a>, that would take an <em>incredibly long time</em> to happen — far longer than the expected lifespan of the universe.

<p>As far as brands go, Intel has etched itself deeply into my mind as a brand I can trust. To say I get a little excited with each successive chip release is an understatement, especially when they offer substantial performance gains over previous generations.</p>



<p>But I haven’t arrived at that point overnight. In one way or another I’ve been enjoying the fruits of the company’s labor for decades — starting with the Intel 386 processor which powered many hours of <em>Wolfenstein 3D</em> gaming.</p>



<p>Decades later that trust has been validated time and time again in my job as a reviewer of PC hardware… But, as much as I hate to say it: not so much of late.</p>



<p>It’s a situation that doesn’t sit right with me, hence why I’m rooting for a successful Intel Core Ultra Series 2 (Lunar Lake) reception now that laptops with the chips have already sta
