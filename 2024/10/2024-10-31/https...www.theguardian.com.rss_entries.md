<p>Film director whose close collaboration with Andy Warhol included the trilogy Flesh, Trash and Heat</p><p>Andy Warhol’s films, which tested the endurance of audiences and made icons out of the marginalised and dissolute, altered profoundly the nature of cinema. Much of the work which bore his name from the late 1960s onwards, however, was made by the writer-director Paul Morrissey, who has died aged 86. “Warhol is a trade term,” said Morrissey. “Like Disney.”</p><p>About his famous friend and collaborator he could be comically scathing. “He didn’t have many points of view,” he said in 1996. “He didn’t have many ideas at all, actually.

<p>The chancellor, on the morning-after media round, just scraped a no-score draw despite a pervasive sense of unkept promises</p><p>The morning after the day and night before. Traditionally the time by which any budget that is going to unravel has started to do so. No wonder Rachel Reeves sounded relatively chipper on the morning media round. OK, her budget hadn’t been declared the greatest ever by the Daily Telegraph, but then she was no Kwasi Kwarteng. And Keir Starmer was no Liz Truss.</p><p>The haters were always going to hate; you could disagree with the politics but the numbers more or less appeared to add up. Well, as much as any chancellor’s numbers ever do. Even the International Monetary Fund had given her the thumbs up. This for a chancellor was about as good as it gets. Everyone knows that all budgets are launched on a wing and a prayer. Graveyards of broken promises.

<p><strong>Theatre Royal Bath<br></strong>Two one-act plays explore mid-century loneliness, exclusion and sexuality in a fine production starring Nathaniel Parker and a scene-stealing Siân Phillips  </p><p>This handsome double-bill of Terence Rattigan’s one-act plays brings together The Browning Version, often seen as one of his finest, with the lesser revived Table Number Seven. The latter proves the more moving. Immaculately paced by director James Dacre, it features a pretender, Pollock (Nathaniel Parker, quietly tragic), parading as an upper-class army man at a well-heeled Bournemouth hotel until he is exposed for “importuning”.</p><p>Set in the midst of Britain’s homosexual witch-hunts of the 1950s, and premiering a year after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2008/feb/10/theatre.gayrights">John Gielgud was arrested for cottaging</a>, Rattigan (himself gay) drafted the major to be propositioning men but later changed it to his sexual harassment of women.

<p>This curate’s egg of a film’s crude humour feels somewhat at odds with the big issues it’s exploring, even if doing so more or less sympathetically</p><p>Here is a highly unusual film. Not because of its subject matter, or its tone, but because of the unlikely marriage between these two things. On the face of it, the plot is that of a sensitive drama exploring the nuances of how multicultural integration in Norway might intersect with identity, particularly as regards transgender kids. The tone, on the other hand, is raucous and often off-putting with crude humour and throwaway references.</p><p>The fact that the script’s edgy maxims are casually thrown out by the young lead, Mahmoud (Ahmed Mohammed), compounds the tonal dissonance. Hearing a young Pakistani teenager say things that conjures the same kinds of cinematic universe as provocative turn of the millennium teen franchises such as American Pie is a little jolting to see in a film that is intent on tackling some big issues

However, the old Tudor house that once stood here is what truly made its ghostly name. It is said that Anne Boleyn continues to haunt her childhood home, carrying her own severed head as she walks the corridors. Sir John Fastolf, an English soldier and the owner of Blickling estate in the 15th century (believed to be the inspiration for Shakespeare’s Falstaff) is also said to haunt Blickling.
