Why build a humanoid robot? Because the world is designed for humans, including all the best Halloween costumes!

We don’t believe humanoid robots should be limited by looking or moving exactly like people, but there’s big advantages to a robot that can fit in as well as stand out. We designed Atlas to be capable, intelligent, and robust, so even when a pesky pickle moves a dolly, the robot can autonomously recognize its new position and complete its task.
