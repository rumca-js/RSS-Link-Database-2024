Plenty of names come to mind when you think of single-player horror games. Silent Hill, Resident Evil, Amnesia, Clock Tower, the list goes on. But what about multiplayer? We've seen titles like The Outlast Trials make an impact over the past year. However, one of the most popular, Phasmophobia, still endures and is out now on consoles.

What makes the experience so intriguing over others is learning about each ghost type. As part of a ghost-hunting crew, you must utilize various tools - from cameras and UV lights to spirit boxes and ghostwriting - to identify them. Each ghost has different traits, and as the investigation proceeds, the paranormal happenings result in mounting tension.

Even if it's a trial-and-error process (without looking up guides, that is) and the lobby browser system could be a lot better, the sheer terror that Phasmophobia instils is refreshing in this day and age.

November 20th marks the release of Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl to PC and Xbox Series X|S and this upcoming open-world survival shooter has been a long time coming, it having been first announced way back in 2010 before being dissolved and revived. 

Developer GSC Game World have shuttered and re-emerged in that time too, but the change of leadership at the Ukrainian studio (now relocated to Czechia) has done nothing to disillusion those expecting a sci-fi shooter. 

Stalker 2 looks fantastic, it’s evocative, decrepit world replete with hostility doesn’t care about the player. Gunfights will be tense, and there’s a complex narrative filled with meaningful choice underpinning the action. The question is, will Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl get in the conversation for game of the year?

Without developers’ technical, artistic, and creative skills and expertise, no game would ever look good, period, but though developing a game on any specific engine doesn’t magically make it a graphical powerhouse, the right developer can use the right engine to make the process of developing a graphical powerhouse a little easier. 

Unreal Engine 5 has been widely adopted by developers across the industry not only because it is evidently a very developer-friendly toolset, but also because its technological leaps do enable developers to make visually stunning games. In recent years, we have already seen a good number of games that illustrate that very point, and here, we’re going to talk about a few such games.
