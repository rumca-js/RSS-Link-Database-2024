Today on the Matt Walsh Show, New York City has abolished its jaywalking laws. Now, New Yorkers are free to get run over in the street, all in the name of “racial equity.” This is just a small taste of the kind of madness we'll see nationwide if Kamala is elected. Also, Donald Trump somehow continues to up his troll game. His latest stunt is the funniest one yet. And, Democrats are running ads claiming that Republicans want to ban p*rn nationwide.

The Kamala Harris campaign is openly encouraging women to lie to their husbands about who they're voting for. That's the entire message of a new ad, narrated by Julia Roberts. And it's perhaps the most vile political ad of all time.
