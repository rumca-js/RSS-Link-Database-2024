<p><strong>Gielgud theatre, London</strong><br>Rylance is entertainingly Chaplinesque as a dissolute husband in Seán O’Casey’s 1924 tragicomedy, but Succession’s J Smith-Cameron is its heart and soul as the long-suffering wife</p><p>A volley of gunshots at the start signifies the violent backdrop to Seán O’Casey’s 1924 tragicomedy, which takes place during the Irish civil war of 1922-23. But it is a distant sound, and musical hall-style comedy and drunken shenanigans take prominence in this production.</p><p>The second in O’Casey’s Dublin trilogy, Juno and the Paycock dramatises tenement life for the Boyles, whose breadwinner, Jack (Mark Rylance), prefers drink to work while his wife, Juno (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/article/2024/may/14/j-smith-cameron-mark-rylance-juno-and-the-paycock-gielgud-theatre-west-end">J Smith-Cameron</a>), is left to earn their keep.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2024/oct/07/juno-and-the-paycock-review-mark-rylance-j-smith-ca

<p>It’s full of holes, lacks nuance and feels flabby – but the excellent performances, as well as the tense and twisty plotting, make this frothy tale a compelling watch</p><p>Despite its daftness, I was fond of the first series of Showtrial, which took the death of a working-class student at a posh university and used it to explore themes of privilege and justice in the British legal system. Viewers liked it, too: it was brash, popular Sunday night fare, an airport novel of a TV series that pirouetted around credibility yet dragged you in with its relentless twists. It returns for a second, starrier season with a similarly over-the-top sensibility – and yet again I have been sucked in, despite the nagging presence of a firmly raised eyebrow during large sections of each of its five episodes.</p><p>This time, it has dipped into its grab-bag of headlines and come up with a story about the tactics of climate activism, offensive police WhatsApp group chats and online conspiracy theories.

<p>Ange Postecoglou wore the thousand-yard stare. The game had felt over at half-time, his Tottenham team two goals to the good, en route surely to a sixth straight win in all competitions. Now the manager stood motionless on the touchline, hands buried deep into coat pockets, struggling to process what had happened. Which was an astonishing Brighton comeback, one that saw them bounce up from the canvas and surge into the lead just after the hour. They would not relinquish it, the home support celebrating wildly at full-time.</p><p>There was an uncomfortable spotlight on the Spurs defending, with Destiny Udogie enduring a personal nightmare, culpable to varying degrees on all three goals. Yet he was not alone. Micky van de Ven, for example, will not enjoy the inquest into his role on the first two, which were scored by Yankuba Minteh and Georginio Rutter.

<p>A woolly update of the bestselling 2000 exploration of epidemics struggles to make its point while relying on so-called universal laws and digressive case histories</p><p>It’s almost 25 years since Malcolm Gladwell published <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/may/06/society1">The Tipping Point</a></em>, which sought to understand social phenomena – the drop in crime in New York or the sudden popularity of Hush Puppies shoes – from an epidemiological perspective. Its main thesis was that cultural changes don’t take place as a matter of steady gradualism but instead reach a critical mass that opens the flood gates or enables a trend or product to “go viral”.</p><p>The book, his first, itself acted like an infectious virus, as it went on to sell millions around the world.

He finds himself suspended between life and death, the hospital a claustrophobic, liminal space where he waits, alone with his regrets as well as his hopes for a peaceful life with his partner, L. He looks down at his beleaguered body: “I had hated it so much and been so ashamed,” he realises. “And I might have loved it instead.” He fantasises about the croquetas L will make for him when he gets back home – that is, of course, if he ever gets back home.</p><p>Love for L fortifies the poet through his horrifying, isolating weeks in hospital. He longs for him in the most primal way, even as he is forced to acknowledge “the little cruelties of intimate life” – his selfishness, and petty ingratitu

<p>But in the end, Simonetta Wenkert managed to combine her two vocations</p><p>It was only meant to be for a year. The restaurant was my husband Avi’s dream, not mine. As a time-poor novelist and mother of three, the very last thing I needed was another commitment to take me away from my desk. But I also knew that my comfortable London life as a freelance writer and stay-at-home mother was only possible because Avi was our family’s main bread winner.

<p>The last of the author’s books about the Hugeunot Joubert clan ends with two intriguing personal missions in South Africa</p><p>There was something very pleasing about the runaway success of Kate Mosse’s last novel, <em>The Ghost Ship</em>, the third of her Joubert family chronicles. The book received little critical attention but was glowingly reviewed by bloggers and became a publicist’s dream: the word-of-mouth bestseller. I interviewed Mosse at Faversham literary festival&nbsp;soon after the book was published and there was a palpable sense of excitement in the room that was easy to understand. Mosse has always been a wonderfully fluent and engaging writer, and here was a novel that drew on classic adventure tales from Robert Louis Stevenson to John Meade Falkner and delivered an explosive and propulsive story of life&nbsp;on the high seas.</p><p>Mosse’s newest book is the last in the Joubert quartet.

The Yellow House was his home outside the city’s ramparts when he moved from Paris to Arles in 1888, hoping (and failing) to start an artists’ colony. It was a studio only in the summer, then furnished for living in the autumn.

<p>Lovely roast squash and baked veg to take the chill out of autumn</p><p>It is the season of cobwebs, trailing across the vegetable gardens and allotments, glistening with dew, each drop sparkling in the early morning light. They hang between the bean sticks and the browning vines of pumpkins. I baked my first squash of the season this week, a plump, smooth-skinned butternut, a little fatter than most. I basted its flesh, firm and orange-bright, with a paste of sweet honey and dark soy sauce and seasoned it with the warmth of ground Aleppo pepper and garlic.</p><p>The butternut – sticky, hot and sweet – glowed brightly on its mound of steamed white rice. There was no sauce as such, and neither does there need to be, just a sprinkling of roasted sesame oil as it was served. We followed it with the very last of the plums, stewed with a little sugar and a cinnamon stick.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/oct/06/nigel-slaters-recipes-for-pumpkin-soy-and-honey-and-fennel

<p>Kemi Badenoch is hellbent on distinguishing herself in the battle to lead the Conservatives, but even she seems to realise how futile it all is</p><p>Have you ever played a party game called “Margaret Thatcher’s dinner party”? It may have other names. Each guest must think of a famous person, alive or dead, fictional or real, of whom the whole group will have heard. Everyone then goes out of the room, one by one, to whisper the name they’ve come up with to a designated host who writes them all down and then reads them out to the group. The aim of the game is to guess who thought of which name, the last person guessed being the winner. Remembering all the names is surprisingly hard, particularly if heavy drinking is encouraged.</p><p>The key to victory is in your choice of name: it has to be well known but also somehow forgettable. A name that, when read out, will hardly be remarked upon. Not a surprising blast from the past, not the man or woman of the moment, but someone blandly i

Chelsea’s manager, Enzo Maresca, wrote a 7,000-word thesis on how it can help train the mind of a football coach.
