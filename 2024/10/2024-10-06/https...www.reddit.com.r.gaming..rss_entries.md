Assassin&#39;s Creed laid the groundwork, but Far Cry 2&#39;s large open world built the solid foundation, and you can make a strong argument that Far Cry 3 was the game that firmly codified the Modern Ubi Formula.

They wanted to make an engine for a PC game that could let you see as far as they eye could see, and be as lush and beautiful as it was fun to play. And possibly melt your computer if it wasn&#39;t powerful enough. That&#39;s where Far Cry began. It was a big success - big enough for Ubi to snap up the IP for itself, and certainly successful enough for Crytek to make a spiritual successor, Crysis (which would most certainly melt your computer if it wasn&#39;t powerful enough.)</p> <p>I&#39;ve been meaning to give it another go, and <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mod

## Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty is the best game I've played all year

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t buy Cyberpunk 2077 until this year, when I saw people saying the 2.0 patch had finally delivered on the pre-launch promise of the game. I got the base game and DLC at a good price and decided to play the base game until the main story &#39;point of no return&#39; before starting the Phantom Liberty DLC. </p> <p>The base game is (in late 2024) very good. The world is big and visually stunning, there are plenty of interesting storylines to follow, the combat/gunplay is satisfying. I&#39;m not someone who puts a ton of hours into single player games, and I found myself drawn to exploring Night City and the many side quests etc. in a way I wouldn&#39;t usually in this kind of game. </p> <p>Phantom Liberty takes everything the base game does well and refines it further. The set pieces are more exciting, the main quest storyline is fantastic, the characters are more interesting and the setting (Dogtown) is as good as the best parts of Night Cit
