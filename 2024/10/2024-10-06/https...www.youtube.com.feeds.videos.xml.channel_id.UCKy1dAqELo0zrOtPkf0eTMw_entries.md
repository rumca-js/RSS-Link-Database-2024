The Silent Hill 2 Remake, by Bloober Team, is the most miserable experience I've had with a game, and that's why this 2024 remake is great. Whether it's the suffocating fog, or the unrelenting darkness of Silent Hill 2's many deadly corridors, Silent Hill 2's nightmarish vision has been preserved, and meaningfully altered for the modern era. This retelling of 2001's Silent Hill 2 is available on PS5 (PlayStation 5) and PC via Steam on October 8, 2024.
