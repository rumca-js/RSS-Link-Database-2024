Simple question really, i was wondering if someone could recommend an equivalent of the Reeder app for Windows? I love that it supports RSS, youtube, mastodon, and BSky all in one app, and syncs between devices. The catch comes with the fact that i have an iphone and an ipad, but my main computing device runs windows. Anyone have a recommendation for an app with a similar feature set but with Windows support?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Arrabiki\"> /u/Arrabiki </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1fx5xa4/equivalent_of_reeder_but_for_windows/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1fx5xa4/equivalent_of_reeder_but_for_windows/\">[comments]</a></span>", "id": 1275157, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1fx5xa4/equivalent_of_reeder_but_for_windows", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 482, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Equivalent of Reeder but for Windows?", "vote": 0}]
