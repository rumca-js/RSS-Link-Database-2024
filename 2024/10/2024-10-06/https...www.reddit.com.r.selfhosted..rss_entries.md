<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have a single mini pc with portainer. This portainer instance sits behind HAProxy (reverse proxy) on Pfsense. Proxy resolves my different domains to my port specific containers, all on the same internal ip. External domains are routed through cloudflare as well.</p> <p>Now to my question. Is there any security concern for the internal containers considering they are on the same host as the external containers? Basically wondering if it is better to have seperate host machines for internal and external containers.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/captingeech"> /u/captingeech </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1fxt5n1/container_security_for_single_host_with_internal/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1fxt5n1/container_security_for_single_host_with_internal/">[comments]</a></span>

I thought that in the event that a registrar doesn&#39;t like you for any non-illegal reason, I can still go back to the registry to claim back my domain (since I will be registering a .UK domain, this will be Nominet). But what I see on Porkbun&#39;s ToS is this:</p> <blockquote> <p>Without limiting any other rights available to us at law or otherwise, Your use of the Hosting Service may be suspended and/or this Agreement may be terminated if Porkbun determines that You are or are <strong>alleged to be violating</strong> the terms and conditions of this Agreement or any other agreement entered into by You and Us, or if such Service or Account is used in association with <strong>morally objectionable activities</strong>, illegal uses, or for <strong>any reason</strong> whatsoever.

I&#39;m trying to enhance the security of my network, particularly to protect it in the event that a Docker container is compromised.</p> <p>Here&#39;s my setup: I use Portainer, and each Docker Compose stack has its own network, in addition to a shared network that connects the frontend components to Traefik. As a result, Traefik has access to numerous networks. Everything is running on Proxmox and I use Unify Cloud Gateway Max as a router and to separate networks.</p> <p>While having separate Docker networks for each stack adds some security, they can still access my local network VLAN dedicated to services. I&#39;ve already segmented my network into different VLANs for guests, LAN, services, IoT, VMs, and privileged access.</p> <p>I&#39;m considering a few options:</p> <ol> <li><str

The main features I&#39;m looking would be a web interface, the ability to tag the items are good too, and when I find a file, it can tell me where it is on the shared drive. (rather not download as that creates a lot of file duplications)</p> <p>I did consider solution such as ngx-paperless, which I guess that is not quite suited to what I am looking for as it doesn&#39;t handle illustrator or psd files. I also considered immich, however didnt feel that was a perfect fit either. </p> <p>I previously remembered seeing a solution called voltage or voltx or something, but I can&#39;t seem to find it anymore... </p> <p>Any help is greatly

So I was thinking about how to do that, maybe some of you solved this before. My initial thought was to have a simple crud service on free tier GCP to which my RPI would be either pinging now and then, or keep some webRTC tunnel.
