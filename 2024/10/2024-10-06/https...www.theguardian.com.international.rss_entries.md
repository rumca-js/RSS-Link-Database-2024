<ul><li>WXV 1: New Zealand 31-49 England</li><li>Dow and Kildunne score two tries each in victory</li></ul><p>Is there anything that can stop the Red Roses in their current form? It is a question that was asked two years ago before New Zealand answered it in the Rugby World Cup final, where they <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/nov/12/new-zealand-win-womens-rugby-world-cup-as-england-suffer-final-heartbreak">ended England’s 30-match winning streak</a> to lift the trophy. That game was the last time England lost and they are building a consecutive victory run again, adding a 19th with an impressive 49-31 win over the Black Ferns in the WXV 1, which means the question is being posed again.</p><p>The Black Ferns had a point to prove after back-to-back defeats. The first came at the hands of the Red Roses, who put one over their rivals three weeks ago at Twickenham, and Ireland caused a huge upset with a narrow victory last Sunday.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/s

This is done by the simple device of linking an individual’s speech to their corporate employer, then pre

The sociologist has a knack for coining terms that gain social currency – including “emotional labor”, in 1983, to describe the need for certain professionals, like flight attendants and bill collectors, to manage their emotions, and “the second shift”, in 1989, to describe women’s household labor.</p><p>Her new book, Stolen Pride: Loss, Shame, and the Rise of the Right, explores what Hochschild calls the “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/07/how-great-paradox-american-politics-holds-secret-trumps-success">pride paradox</a>”: because conservative Americans value personal responsibility, they feel proud when they do well, and blame themselves when they don’t.

<p>For 25 years the company, built by two publicity-shy British brothers, has turned everything from bears to burgers into ‘plushies’. Avid fans explain their appeal</p><p>It started with a boiled egg. Last year, Chloe Day, 25, kept seeing it all over social media. She was intrigued. It wasn’t the kind of egg you’d have for breakfast. There was a smiley face on the bright yellow yolk and little legs descending from the egg white. At 14cm tall, it was adorable – the egg part soft and fluffy and the legs made out of brown corduroy.</p><p>What Day was seeing, on social media and in shops, was an “amuseable” boiled egg by Jellycat, a brand that specialises in cute soft toys with smiley faces. “I remember it so clearly,” she says. “It kept cropping up.
