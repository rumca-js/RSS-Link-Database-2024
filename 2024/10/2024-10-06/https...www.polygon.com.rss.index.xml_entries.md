<p class="has-drop-cap has-text-align-none">Canadian filmmaker Pascal Plante was already dwelling on the eldritch terrors that lurked below the surface of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/2/23708094/international-police-dark-web-monopoly-market-bust">dark web</a> before the COVID-19 pandemic sent him into lockdown.

<p class="has-drop-cap has-text-align-none">A good horror game scares you in the moment, but a great horror game lingers in the back of your mind well past the end credits. We’ve been blessed in recent years with a plethora of excellent horror games, but with the arrival of October comes even more spooky games to get us nice and scared before Halloween. <em>Mouthwashing</em> immediately gripped me with its jarring, off-putting visuals, and kept me pinned under the weight of mounting dread.&nbsp;</p>
