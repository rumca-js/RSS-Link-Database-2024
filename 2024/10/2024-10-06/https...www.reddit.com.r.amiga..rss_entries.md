<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone.</p> <p>This is my first post here so perhaps pardon my ignorance I&#39;m thrashing over old news.</p> <p>My A1200&#39;s floppy stopped working on the majority of floppies I still own a few years back so I tried a floppy disk cleaner and it only made matters worse. I was stuck with an internal HD but with no operating system onboard so I purchased a Workbench 3.1 CF card with adapter and I have a floppy drive on order, hopefully I can get my own programs created with GFA basic back onto HD.</p> <p>I&#39;d also like to get some of my old games installed but I remembered that with previous attempts disk copying was not the solution and only simple public domain games could transferred to hard drive without problems.</p> <p>It seems that copy protection on the source floppies of commercial games prevented me from moving them to hard drive. Now we are in an era of emulation I&#39;m wondering if I can somehow get my old floppy games onto CF car

## capturing Amiga video output

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>i&#39;m still looking for a good (perfect?) way to capture Amiga video. i&#39;m currently using a Amiga-RGB-to-S-Video adapter, connected to an analog-capturing USB stick, which works well enough. there are a couple of issues, but currently my main problem is finding the right settings (encoding, compression, ...) to properly capture all (or, as much as possible) of the Amiga&#39;s graphics. for example, quick full screen flashes, as seen in &quot;State of the Art&quot; demo, are problematic, as are zoomers with thousands of moving rectangles. and, overall, individual interlace scanlines easily get lost in compression.</p> <p>long story short: do you have a working Amiga-RGB-capture setup that does &quot;perfect&quot; captures? what do you use? and what are your video encoding settings?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/AMIGAalive"> /u/AMIGAalive </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/am

## *Not looking for valuation* Toshiba Timm

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m an Apple guy and bought a Toshiba Timm in a large lot of Macintosh stuff and I understand it at one time was a borderline grail display for the Amiga guys and I&#39;m wondering if that&#39;s still the case or if it&#39;s not as relevant with the modern converters and stuff. My reason for asking I&#39;m considering selling it cause I don&#39;t really have a need for a 15KHz display and have other CRTs that I prefer for RGB and composite.</p> <p>Thanks in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/LordofRiverrun"> /u/LordofRiverrun </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1fx85co/not_looking_for_valuation_toshiba_timm/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1fx85co/not_looking_for_valuation_toshiba_timm/">[comments]</a></span>
