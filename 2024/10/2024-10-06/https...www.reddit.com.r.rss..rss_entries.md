<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all! Simple question really, i was wondering if someone could recommend an equivalent of the Reeder app for Windows? I love that it supports RSS, youtube, mastodon, and BSky all in one app, and syncs between devices. The catch comes with the fact that i have an iphone and an ipad, but my main computing device runs windows. Anyone have a recommendation for an app with a similar feature set but with Windows support?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Arrabiki"> /u/Arrabiki </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1fx5xa4/equivalent_of_reeder_but_for_windows/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1fx5xa4/equivalent_of_reeder_but_for_windows/">[comments]</a></span>
