I was stuck with an internal HD but with no operating system onboard so I purchased a Workbench 3.1 CF card with adapter and I have a floppy drive on order, hopefully I can get my own programs created with GFA basic back onto HD.</p> <p>I&#39;d also like to get some of my old games installed but I remembered that with previous attempts disk copying was not the solution and only simple public domain games could transferred to hard drive without problems.</p> <p>It seems that copy protection on the source floppies of commercial games prevented me from moving them to hard drive.
