<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This question is directed at anybody who has played through one or both of the Saga Expansions (Shy Pluto &amp; Terra Proxima).</p> <p>I like to sleeve my games, it&#39;s calming, gives me additional enjoyment out of my games, so my base game is sleeved. I&#39;ve recently picked up the expansions (Genesis, Pluto &amp; Terra Proxima) But I also don&#39;t want to risk ruining the surprise needlessly - or at least be able to brace for it. Understand that I have unsealed the boxes, but not the card packs yet.</p> <p>So here&#39;s my question, do the discovery cards (the tall narrow cards that are the same size as the ship cards) get shuffled in to the game as you play or otherwise interact with the rest of the ship cards on the table in a matter that being unsleeved, next to sleeved base game cards, would be any way disruptive to the gameplay? </p> <p>TLDR - Will I screw myself and have to sleeve as I go, if my base game is sleeved, but the expansion isn&

## How important to you is the inclusion of physical rules?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>The majority of games will have physical instructions included (instructions, manual, rulebook, etc.). Some instead opt for having a QR code or link in another form that to either a PDF or website with said rules. There are reasons for the creator/manufacturer doing either, and it surely depends on the game (with factors affecting complexity). With that said, how important is the inclusion of physical rules or instructions?</p> <p>Personally, I love the physical inclusion of rules and enjoyed when it was standard for video games to have them as well. With the ease and affordability of Internet access, this has become less vital and more efforts to be conscious of environmental factors, or for the manufacturer to cut costs, are considered. I&#39;m designing a game myself and the physical inclusion of rules is something that I&#39;m currently pondering over. It seems of popular opinion that unnecessary components are bloat - but at the same time I&#39;v

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’m curious if anyone else who has played “Sounds Fishy”has had a similar experience.</p> <p>My family was interested in this game because of the possibility of rather amusing, silly answers to the questions presented. However, from the beginning as we read through the rules there were already concerns with how to play, or how fun it would actually be. As the Blue Kipper, do you simply read the question with a different tone of voice? If so, how can you be creative? We weren’t convinced, but we decided to simply try it out and see how it went—however the vague rules were quickly manipulated once the Red Herrings realized that they could make their answer so close to the real one that it was merely a guessing game and a fast vocabulary contest.</p> <p>We thought perhaps if we simply made a rule against similar answers, then it could be more like our original idea of the game, but then, where do you draw the line? What is too close to the answer? Furthe

I think more games need it but the action types you can take on each turn are very different.

The game takes about 40-60 mins but the first 30 you don’t do much, maybe collect 1-2 light per turn. Then the last 20ish mins you collect 5+ light per turn and the game rapidly comes to an end. </p> <p>Anyone play it and like it? I’m wondering if we are just not performing good strategies.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Planet of the Apes the miniature game is about to launch, but there have been rumors flying around about a possible involvement from Mythic Games. A certain number of Mythic Games&#39; backers complained about receiving advertisement emails for this Gamefound project, but didn&#39;t understand why. The publisher made a statement in the comment section of the project. He explained about a previous relationship with Mythic Games, and said they purchased a mailing list from a marketing company on the freelancer platform Fiverr. But when asked afterwards, they refused to give the name of the marketing company themselves, which is a big red flag. For all we know, it could be the new company of Leonidas.</p> <p>Back this project wittingly.</p> <p>Here is the link to the project&#39;s comment section :<br/> <a href="https://gamefound.com/fr/projects/rv62/planet-of-the-apes-board-game/comments">https://gamefound.com/fr/projects/rv62/planet-of-the-apes-board-g
