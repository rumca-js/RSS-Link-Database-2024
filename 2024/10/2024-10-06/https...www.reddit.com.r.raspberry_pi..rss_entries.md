<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’ve been trying to connect my pi to a pisugar 3 plus and it doesn’t seem to be working. I plug the usb c into the pisugar and the micro usb into the pi but it doesn’t turn on, I’ve double checked that the pi sugar is indeed on, with the blue light on. But it still doesn’t supply power, plugging the pi into a wall or my pc turns it on perfectly fine? Could it be a faulty PiSugar? Thank you</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ForgottenDogXD"> /u/ForgottenDogXD </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1fxowlf/my_pisugar_3_plus_doesnt_seem_to_power_my/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1fxowlf/my_pisugar_3_plus_doesnt_seem_to_power_my/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Since I moved to another city for college and I don&#39;t have money for a good laptop, I decided to bring my Raspberry pi 5 with 8GB RAM to play games via GeForce Now (it works without any problems, except that the raspberry pi heats up a bit more). It occurred to me can some games work if I downloaded directly to the raspberry pi via steam. This is some of my &quot;research&quot; that I did, maybe it will be useful to someone. I downloaded Box86, Box64 and Steam via PiApps, I use Raspbian Bookworm, my monitor has a resolution of 1366 * 768.</p> <p>This is games I tested that work:</p> <ul> <li>Alien Swarm</li> <li>The Beguinner&#39;s Guide</li> <li>Bloons TD Battles</li> <li>Classic Marathon</li> <li>Classic Marathon 2</li> <li>Classic Marathon Infinity</li> <li>Counter - Strike 1.6 (with proton, native doesn&#39;t work)</li> <li>Counter - Strike: Condition Zero (with proton, native doesn&#39;t work)</li> <li>Counter - Strike: Source</li> <li>Day of

## I have monitored the clock signal from a RPI 5, and as the picture illustrates, the clock signal is behaving in a peculiar manner.
