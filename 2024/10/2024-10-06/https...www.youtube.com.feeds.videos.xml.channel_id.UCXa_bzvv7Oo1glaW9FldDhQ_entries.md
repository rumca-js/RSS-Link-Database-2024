Mech games have been few and far between over the years, but fortunately, MechWarrior 5: Clans signals a return to some good old-fashioned BattleMech combat. Not to be confused with MechWarrior 5: Mercenaries, launched in December 2019 for PC before coming to Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, and PS5 in 2021, this is a separate experience that's more story-driven.

MechWarrior 5: Clans launches on October 17th for Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC.

That, of course, means there is no shortage of things in the game that we absolutely cannot wait to get our hands on, from some of its core systems to other, more obscure little features. Here, that’s exactly what we discuss.
