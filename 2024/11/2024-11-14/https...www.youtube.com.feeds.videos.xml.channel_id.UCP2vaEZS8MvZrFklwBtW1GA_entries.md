Plywood subfloor tool tip…I normally use tongue and groove 23/32 plywood inside bathrooms. One problem is pushing adjacent panels together. This flooring jack is one solution. I place it against the bottom plate/stud and panel edge. I push the handle and that gives me the 1/8” expansion joint I need 👍🏽🔥#carpentry #plywood #bathroomremodel #homerenovation
