I've dipped my toes back into the Pok&eacute; pool more recently, of course, but I don't think my love for it now will ever be as strong again as it was back when I was a rabid 10-year-old playing Red and Yellow on my Game Boy.

But it is the kind of game you're likely to keep on thinking about long after you've finished poking and prodding its collection of four strange tales. Based around a quartet of miniature objects, which are kept inside a mysterious treasure box on the game's menu screen, these standalone stories all share one important theme: they celebrate the weird and unknowable corners of childhood imagination, and how simple, everyday occurrences can balloon to magical proportions.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/miniatures-is-a-dreamy-interactive-picture-book-of-strange-dark-tales-i-would-have-loved-to-have-as-a-kid">Read more</a></p>
