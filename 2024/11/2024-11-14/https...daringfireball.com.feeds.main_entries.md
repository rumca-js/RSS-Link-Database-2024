<p>Bill Atkinson, on Facebook, “Request for Prayers”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On October first, I was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Because
of vascular involvement, surgery is not possible. I am taking
weekly chemo treatments to shrink the tumor before surgical
resection. I am tolerating the chemo pretty well, and I am in good
spirits. Every day I make a point of getting out in the sun and
walking with Cai and Poppy. [...]</p>

<p>At 73 years, I have already lived an amazing and wonderful life. I
have loved and been loved, beginning with my remarkable mother who
believed in me. With my work at Apple and General Magic I am
grateful that I could make positive contributions to the lives of
many millions of people, and even affect the course of human
evolution.</p>

<p>But I want more quality time to share life and experiences with
Cai and with my friends and family. My bucket list is not filled
with places to travel, but instead with quality time with those I
love and those who love
