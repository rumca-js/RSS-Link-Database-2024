Basically, it should be a Korean or Chinese action-focused novel with a male protagonist and no romance or harem (I hate both). I would like it if the MC also has loyal subordinates (MOSTLY male), that we can see a lot of throughout the book, and preferably, the MC is also strong (can start from weak then become strong or strong from the start). It could also be already translated or not; I can MTL by myself.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Acceptable-Ferret-89"> /u/Acceptable-Ferret-89 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1grhoqp/knovels_with_male_mc_and_no_romance/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1grhoqp/knovels_with_male_mc_and_no_romance/">[comments]</a></span>

Like, I want the mmc to often humiliate the fmc for reasons like being lazy, too fat, dark-skinned and other vague af reasons... but I want him to really humiliate her. A specific thing I&#39;m looking for in the book is for the fmc to ask the mmc for money, but mmc to deny her any financial help bcos he thinks she&#39;s too irresponsible or maybe thinking she&#39;s asking for no reason (I don&#39;t want her to turn to anybody else for money tho)... i want her to be asking for money for a genuine reason. And the fmc should be a total doormat. I don&#39;t mind physical abuse to be a part of the story, but it shouldn&#39;t get to the point of kicking or stuff, just slaps.</p> <p>*I don&#39;t want any HR recs, please. *I would love any book that would suit this but if it&#39;s an indian book, that&#39;s just a cherry on top. *I don&#39;t mind wattpad recs.</p>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi, so I‚Äôm looking for sci-fi thats existential, dark, and violent. Something akin to Starfish by Peter Watts, as I&#39;ve actually really enjoyed my time with the book. Well, up until the end, lol. And I decided to sink into Blindsight, also a very good time as well. But that‚Äôs coming to a close soon. </p> <p>Basically, I want something with characters that are dark or strange‚Äîexplores their twisted psyches. Something that oozes a good foreboding atmosphere. Whether it&#39;s set in a Space or Cyberpunk setting. I want something that‚Äôll make my skin crawl. </p> <p>I&#39;ll also list a few more examples of what I‚Äôm looking for and the qualities I admire about them to give it more of a general idea: </p> <p>Dead Space: Atmosphere</p> <p>Necromancer: Atmosphere/Characters</p> <p>Armor: Badass</p> <p>District 9: Atmosphere</p> <p>Marrow: Atmosphere/Characters</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SappySale

One series I enjoyed quite a bit is &quot;The Last Hunter&quot;. </p> <p>Ironically this composed some of the topes I just talked about are used but what sets it apart is the depth of characters, I actually care about them, and the overarching plot manages to stay interesting and mysterious despite utilizing the same tired tropes.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s from the 90s. There were some archeologists or explorers who discovered an unknown giant cave system in I think Mexico. There were some semi humanoid life forms there, but what I remember vividly is that at some point they were in a tunnel being chased by hungry spiders, like albino tarantulas that covered the floor walls and ceiling. Then the tunnel came to and end, and they had to choose to jump or get eaten because the spiders were coming. Right at this moment the chapter ended and the next one started with some other relevant character reading a newspaper in New York. This is seared in my brain as literally the ultimate cliffhanger. </p> <p>They did jump and landed in a giant pool of bat guano.</p> <p>I would love to find this so I can experience that again, and share it with my son. </p> <p>Any help would be appreciated.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/I-have-extra-organs">
