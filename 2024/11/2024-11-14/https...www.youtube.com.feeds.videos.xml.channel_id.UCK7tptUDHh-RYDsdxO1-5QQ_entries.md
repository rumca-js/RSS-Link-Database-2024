American Airlines created the first major airline loyalty program in 1981 as a way to compete for customers post-deregulation. But today these programs are the industry norm, having transformed into billions of dollar businesses with legs outside the aviation industry. The AAdvantage loyalty program has even become a business in its own right with airlines selling miles to banks, and was followed by similar programs with United, Delta, Southwest, and more.
