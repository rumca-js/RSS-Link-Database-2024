Because\nof vascular involvement, surgery is not possible. I am taking\nweekly chemo treatments to shrink the tumor before surgical\nresection. I am tolerating the chemo pretty well, and I am in good\nspirits. Every day I make a point of getting out in the sun and\nwalking with Cai and Poppy. [...]</p>\n\n<p>At 73 years, I have already lived an amazing and wonderful life. I\nhave loved and been loved, beginning with my remarkable mother who\nbelieved in me. With my work at Apple and General Magic I am\ngrateful that I could make positive contributions to the lives of\nmany millions of people, and even affect the course of human\nevolution.</p>\n\n<p>But I want more quality time to share life and experiences with\nCai and with my friends and family.
