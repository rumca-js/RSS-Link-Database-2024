<p>Last Updated on November 14, 2024 Gladiator 2 has been a long time coming. Ridley Scott’s masterpiece arrived at the turn of the millennium and made a megastar of Russell Crowe in the title role. Decades later, we are back in Ancient Rome in the glorious Colosseum in a sequel that may have come as a surprise to many considering the first film’s ending. So Gladiator 2 is here with Paul Mescal in the main role with a lot to live up to – do the film gods stand with Gladiator 2 or should it have been killed with a merciful stroke of the sword?
