<p>The Rust Foundation, which stewards development of the <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3218074/what-is-rust-safe-fast-and-easy-software-development.html">Rust language</a>, has released a statement addressing challenges and opportunities for interoperability between Rust and <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3526592/c-alliance-takes-aim-at-c-memory-safety.html">C++</a>, with the intent of making cross-language development more accessible and approachable.</p>



<p>Formally announced November 12, the foundation’s <a href="https://github.com/rustfoundation/interop-initiative/blob/main/problem-statement.md">C++/Rust Interoperability Problem Statement</a> aims to overcome the o

<p>JetBrains IDEs, with new 2024.3 edition releases, now provide a logical code structure view alongside the familiar physical code structure view in the Structure tool window. The updated IDEs also streamline debugging for Kubernetes applications and provide cluster-wide Kubernetes log access with streaming and pattern matching.</p>



<p>JetBrains announced the 2024.3 releases on November  12. The updated versions of the IDEs will be available soon through <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/">JetBrains’ website</a> and<a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox-app/"> Toolbox App</a>, the company said. </p>



<p>The JetBrains IDEs covered by the release include IntelliJ IDEA (<a href="https://ww

<p>Aspect-oriented programming (AOP) decomposes an application’s source code into distinct aspects that isolate the core business logic from cross-cutting concerns. With AOP, cross-cutting concerns like logging and authentication become “aspects” that you program in one place and then apply in all of the places they’re needed. Thus AOP enhances modularity, makes your code more readable and maintainable, and helps you reduce coding errors. You can learn more about AOP from my previous <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2245539/my-two-cents-on-aspect-oriented-programming.html">article</a> here.</p>

<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Virtualization seemed to be one of those technologies that was done. With Hyper-V, VMware, and KVM all offering similar features and performance, all that was left to do was to support new chipset instructions and fix bugs. But slowly things began to change, as operating systems and platforms adopted <a href="https://www.networkworld.com/article/969185/what-is-a-virtual-machine-and-why-are-they-so-useful.html">virtual machines</a> and <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3310941/why-you-should-use-docker-and-containers.html">containers</a> as key building blocks.</h1>
