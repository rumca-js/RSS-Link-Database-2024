Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Season 1 has begun! The franchise classic map, Nuketown, just can't catch a break. In the new season, Treyarch added an easter egg to Nuketown that involves all the mannequins that are randomly placed around the map. To trigger the Nuketown Easter Egg you must go around the entire map and pop the heads off every mannequin. This must be done quickly in order to trigger the Fallout-like stand-by screen that initiates the easter egg. Once that's completed, the screen will change to have a sort of old style CRT scan lines and mannequins will rise from the ground like zombies to attack you.
