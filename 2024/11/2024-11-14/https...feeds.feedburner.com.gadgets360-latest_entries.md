Archaeologists in Israel have discovered 12,000-year-old doughnut-shaped pebbles at Nahal Ein Gev II, suggesting early experimentation with rotational tools. Believed to have functioned as spindle whorls, these artefacts may have been used for spinning textiles. The study, published in PLOS One, suggests that such early rotational tools could have laid the groundwork for more advanced wheel technologies essential in later civilisations. Researchers argue that these tools may have supported innovations in storage, subsistence, and textile crafting long before the advent of the wheel as we know it.

Asteroid 99942 Apophis, named after the ancient Egyptian god of darkness, is set to pass incredibly close to Earth in 2029, at just 32,000 km. While there is no risk of a collision, scientists are keen to study the asteroid’s interaction with Earth's gravity. Research led by planetary scientist Ronald Ballouz suggests that this flyby may cause significant alterations to Apophis' surface. As it zooms past Earth, the asteroid will likely experience seismic events and shifts in its rotation due to gravitational forces. These changes could result in long-term surface alterations, offering a rare opportunity for scientists to study the effects of planetary flybys on asteroids.

China's Zhurong rover has found what might be the shoreline of an ancient Martian ocean, offering fresh support for theories that Mars once had vast bodies of water. Studying images and radar data from Utopia Planitia, the largest impact basin on Mars, scientists identified geological features that resemble coastlines, including pitted cones, troughs, and sediment channels. These findings, published in Scientific Reports, reveal potential evolutionary insights into the Red Planet's water history. The discovery suggests that Mars may have had conditions suitable for microbial life, making it a significant development in the search for evidence of ancient life on Mars.
