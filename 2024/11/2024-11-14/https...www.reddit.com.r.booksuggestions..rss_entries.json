Any book recommendations to help with this? Reading helps with changing the way I view and look at life. I just finished reading \u201cThe Untethered Soul\u201d which helped me with my mental health which is something I\u2019ve struggled with my whole life. So I\u2019m hoping finding a good book might help me with my confidence. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ThrowRa_LilPrincess\"> /u/ThrowRa_LilPrincess </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1gqukv2/books_thatll_boost_confidence/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1gqukv2/books_thatll_boost_confidence/\">[comments]</a></span>", "id": 1511832, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1gqukv2/books_thatll_boost_confidence", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 532, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Books that\u2019ll boost confidence?", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-11-14T02:10:13+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I want a book about social cues and what to say and not to say to people, there is how to win friends and influence people but that\u2019s not what I\u2019m looking for, I\u2019m looking for a book describing at a basic level how humans perceive interactions and how I can use such data to improve what comes out of my mouth, because I have too many faux pas and I can come off as a jerk.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Hot_Engineering_4821\"> /u/Hot_Engineering_4821 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1gqu6z4/how_to_become_better_at_talking/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1gqu6z4/how_to_become_better_at_talking/\">[comments]</a></span>", "id": 1511833, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1gqu6z4/how_to_become_better_at_talking", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 532, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "How to become better at talking?", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-11-14T01:49:36+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I think it&#39;s from the 90s. There were some archeologists or explorers who discovered an unknown giant cave system in I think Mexico. There were some semi humanoid life forms there, but what I remember vividly is that at some point they were in a tunnel being chased by hungry spiders, like albino tarantulas that covered the floor walls and ceiling. Then the tunnel came to and end, and they had to choose to jump or get eaten because the spiders were coming. Right at this moment the chapter ended and the next one started with some other relevant character reading a newspaper in New York. This is seared in my brain as literally the ultimate cliffhanger. </p> <p>They did jump and landed in a giant pool of bat guano.</p> <p>I would love to find this so I can experience that again, and share it with my son. </p> <p>Any help would be appreciated.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/I-have-extra-organs\"> ", "id": 1511834, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1gqtsb2/help_me_find_this_book", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 532, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Help me find this book", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-11-14T01:30:36+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>What are some of your favourite fantasy books ?
