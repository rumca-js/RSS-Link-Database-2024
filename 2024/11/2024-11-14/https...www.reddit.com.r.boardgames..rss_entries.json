Despite being young, they both pick the games up quickly (I can hardly beat them anymore \ud83d\ude1d). </p> <p>To the point: what would be some good \u201cnext step\u201d games that have some more depth so I can delve a little deeper into the hobby with them?

In the Weapons section on page 10, however, it says &quot;After using the weapon, roll one die to check it for Exhaustion. Remember, the item is exhausted if this roll is <strong>equal to or less</strong> than the red die on the counter.&quot; </p> <p>Which one is correct for checking exhaustion for a weapon? It seems like it should be <em>higher</em> so that all Exhaustion rolls are uniform--especially since it said &quot;Remember&quot;--but I&#39;m not sure.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/WinesburgOhio\"> /u/WinesburgOhio </a> <br/> <span><a h", "id": 1515511, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1gr7j41/rule_question_about_endurance_2023_solo_game", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 473, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Rule question about Endurance (2023 solo game about Shackleton, from Hollandspiele)", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-11-14T15:31:16+00:00", "description": "<table> <tr><td> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1gr7dgs/what_board_games_do_you_enjoy_more_in_their/\"> <img src=\"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/wIGcj6G74BrYU8r5DO0-vZgOIJW3V7tGLEz-HpgnLOI.jpg\" alt=\"What board games do you enjoy more in their digital version than the physical one?\" title=\"What board games do you enjoy more in their digital version than the physical one?\" /> </a> </td><td> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/yazeeenq\"> /u/yazeeenq </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gr7dgs\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1gr7dgs/what_board_games_do_you_enjoy_more_in_their/\">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>", "id": 1515506, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1gr7dgs/what_board_games_do_you_enjoy_more_in_their", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 473, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/wIGcj6G74BrYU8r5DO0-vZgOIJW3V7tGLEz-HpgnLOI.jpg", "title": "What board games do you enjoy more in their digital version than the physical one?", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-11-14T15:30:13+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>What do you think of That&#39;s Not a Hat (Regular) vs That&#39;s Not a Hat (Pop Culture)?

It&#39;s supposed to be used when you have no other vehicle available for moving, so, if you only have one vehicle, do you have to wait until the other players have moved at least one of their vehicles so you can coast with yours? Also, the 2 dice limit, is a 2 dice limit per round or for the rest of the game? And the last question, you can only coast once per turn, you cannot put both dice in the same coasting turn, right?</p> <p>We had 3 races yesterday and were having a blast, but we treated coasting as an extra 2 move that you could use when you had dice available, and not as an &quot;extra action&quot; that you can only take if you don&#39;t have any vehicle that hadn&#39;t move and hadn&#39;t use any command (we did apply this last restriction).</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Kar", "id": 1515064, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1gr5hbr/thunder_road_vendetta_coasting_rules", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 473, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Thunder Road Vendetta: Coasting rules", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-11-14T13:19:47+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Me and my boyfriend really got into playing board games.
