I tried to use openvpn from rapid, but it has an issue that I&#39;m working out with credentials.

Free alternatives to commercial software exist, offering the same educational and professional opportunities. Instead of resorting to theft, use these free options. They offer a <strong>more ethical approach</strong> that avoids profiting from piracy while <strong>achieving the same goals&quot;</strong>.</p> <p>For the purpose of this post , just focus on software piracy .
