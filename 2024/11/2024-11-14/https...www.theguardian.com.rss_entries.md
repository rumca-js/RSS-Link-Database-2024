<p><strong>Battersea Arts Centre, London<br></strong>Ocean Chillingworth’s show depicts a brutal fight that turns into something altogether messier</p><p>This much we know from the title: there will be blood. We’re given plastic ponchos to wear, if we want, in case of splatter (washable). The small performance area, lined with seats, houses a white armchair, a metal coffee urn and a forlornly potted tree. On the chair sprawls the bloody corpse of Ocean Chillingworth, hair, face, body, arms, hands, legs, feet all glistening deep red. On the carpet hovers a ghost – that is, someone draped in a white sheet with cut-out holes for eyes. Should we be really unnerved, or really not?</p><p>It’s the kind of question that runs through Blood Show, the second of Chillingworth’s planned Extinction Trilogy (after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/nov/01/monster-show-review-trans-interpretation-of-frankenstein-is-a-stomping-experiment-camden-peoples-theatre">Monster Show</a> and befor

<p>The Hollywood star is to appear at Theatre Royal Drury Lane in Shakespeare’s late play about sorcery. But what is the secret to playing the great magician?</p><p>I have one thing in common with Andrew Lloyd Webber: we both saw John Gielgud play Prospero at the Theatre Royal Drury Lane in 1957. The big difference is that, since Lord Lloyd Webber now owns the theatre, he was able to suggest Shakespeare be revived at the Lane for the first time in 67 years in the shape of a new Jamie Lloyd production of The Tempest starring Sigourney Weaver. It is an imaginative piece of casting and set me thinking, as someone who has looked on a storm of Tempests, about Prosperos of the past.</p><p>The play itself is, as Anne Barton once wrote, “an extraordinarily obliging work of art”: it is open to multiple meanings and endlessly diverse stagings. Prospero can also be played in a variety of ways but, surveying the 40 or so productions I have seen, I have picked out four key interpretations. There

<p>English football grounds in the late 1980s could be grey and downbeat but that changed thanks to Manchester City fan Frank Newton  </p><p>Amidst the depressing backdrop of hooliganism and the imminent threat of ID cards, grounds during the 1988–89 campaign could be downbeat, grey and sometimes largely deserted. On the face of it, life could have been especially grim for Manchester City fans, given that this was now the second consecutive campaign they’d competed in the Second Division.</p><p>But City still had the sixth-highest average attendance across the four divisions and, in their shiny sky-blue kit, had harvested a rich crop of English talent from their youth team, including lightning-quick winger David White, midfielder Paul Lake – tipped for an England call-up – and forward Paul Moulden, who’d plundered an absurdly high number of goals at youth-team level and was now scoring for the first team too. A year before, they put an eye-catching 10 goals past Malcolm Macdonald’s H

Billy called the otter Molly, and started feeding it. On the voiceover his wife, Susan, says Molly took over their lives, and she’s not kidding. By the end of the film, Molly is living in a handbuilt miniature bothy in the garden, dining on haddock; we get to feast on Shetland’s epic scenery, beautifully shot by wildlife cameraman and National Geographic photographer Charlie Hamilton James.</p><p>Otters are apparently extremely shy, so Molly must be desperate, Billy reasoned when he found her in March 2021. He bought a book about otters, which was no help at all trying to raise a pup, so he made it u

<p>It was once the envy of the world – but now its arrogance and failure to change or take risks lie at the root of its decline</p><p>About 50 years ago, a man named Hans Bauer who worked in marketing for a German carmaker came up with the slogan <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/18/vorsprung-durch-technik-advertising-germany">Vorsprung durch </a></em><em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/18/vorsprung-durch-technik-advertising-germany">Technik</a></em> or “advantage through technology”.

<p>This gripping adaptation of Patrick Radden Keefe’s bestselling book tells the shocking story of the IRA’s Price sisters, but makes little attempt to hide its sympathies</p><p>Say Nothing could so easily be absolute chaos. It comprises at least seven narratives, jumping back and forth over four decades, with different actors playing older and younger versions of the same characters. But it has such a firm grasp of those characters – and of all its stories and the history against which they unfold – that you are never confused, only gripped throughout.</p><p>This is not to say that the nine-part drama about the Troubles is without troubling aspects, but we will get to&nbsp;that. Based on the bestselling 2018 book of the same name by the New Yorker staff writer Patrick Radden Keefe, it opens with an abduction so cruel that it will become notorious – that of Jean McConville (played by Judith Roddy), a widowed mother of 10 in west Belfast.

<p>After the publication of a damning report into a decades-long child abuse scandal, Justin Welby has bowed to pressure to resign as archbishop of Canterbury. Harriet Sherwood reports</p><p>A former oil executive turned archbishop, it was hoped Justin Welby’s management experience would hold the Church of England together as it navigated the modern world. As the archbishop of Canterbury, he steered a careful path through divisions in the global Anglican church over ordaining women and same-sex marriage. But it was another persistent issue in the church – the mishandling and cover-up of historical sexual abuse scandals – that proved to be his downfall. He was due to retire in January 2026, but a damning report published last week made his position untenable.</p><p>John Smyth, a leader of Christian camps attended by people including Welby, used his position to gain power over hundreds of boys. He sadistically beat and tortured at least 130 boys and young men in the UK, Zimbabwe and So
