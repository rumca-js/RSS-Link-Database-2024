But there is no way to get the donation version of FreeFileSync when using it in Docker. So I need a recommendation for another file syncing software that can run in Docker and sync over SFTP. </p> <p>I also need to be able to tell it to sync only certain folders in one directory. What I mean is on one side of the sync I may be syncing C:\\Users\\Sevyn\\ and I tell it to only include \\Documents and \\Music in the sync not everything in C:\\Users\\Sevyn\\.</p> <p>Thank you!!!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Sevynz13\"> /u/Sevynz13 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1", "id": 1513118, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1gr0tqi/help_with_a_recommendation_for_a_file_syncing", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 450, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Help with a recommendation for a file syncing software.", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-11-14T08:46:17+00:00", "description": "<table> <tr><td> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1gr0k5r/my_home_server_dashboard/\"> <img src=\"https://preview.redd.it/m18v5r8fyt0e1.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=41d4ad2616bf48e617d5f47ad6d9526ac78681ee\" alt=\"My Home Server Dashboard\" title=\"My Home Server Dashboard\" /> </a> </td><td> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/80lm80\"> /u/80lm80 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://i.redd.it/m18v5r8fyt0e1.png\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1gr0k5r/my_home_server_dashboard/\">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>", "id": 1513116, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1gr0k5r/my_home_server_dashboard", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 450, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://preview.redd.it/m18v5r8fyt0e1.png?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=41d4ad2616bf48e617d5f47ad6d9526ac78681ee", "title": "My Home Server Dashboard", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-11-14T08:21:49+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>If you have a French ISP real residential broadband proxy, I can use Japanese or American network proxy to exchange</p> <p>I have Rakuten 5G in Japan and T-Mobile Verizon AT&amp;T in USA</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/JackChen0514\"> /u/JackChen0514 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1gr095m/network_proxy_exchange/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1gr095m/network_proxy_exchange/\">[comments]</a></span>", "id": 1513117, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1gr095m/network_proxy_exchange", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 450, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Network Proxy Exchange", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-11-14T07:57:28+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi, I am looking for a platform that lets me track some value over time, normally retrieved by some Python script.

I used this before and I find myself having to write the exporter (not too bad), installing it as a service with a port (somehow I don&#39;t prefer this), editing<code>prometheus.yml</code> with the new exporter (don&#39;t like this either), and dealing with the API to delete old data (ew). Grafana&#39;s charts are quite nice however.</p> <p>Maybe what I&#39;m looking for is a simple Prometheus alternative that supports push.

I have tried to centralize on AWS for everything that isn&#39;t practical to host oneself like DNS, but the behavior of ACM specifically is somewhat problematic - either you use an ACM public cert and can&#39;t export it for use by home network services, or use a private cert authority cert which works for my home network (after trusting the private CA) but can&#39;t be used by something public-facing since the private CA isn&#39;t publicly trusted. I would rather keep as much of my shit in AWS as possible because I&#39;m managing all this with terraform and am worried about adding additional third-party cloud services that might not have terraform providers as well-developed as the AWS provider, would it be possible to generate the cert in ACM PCA t", "id": 1512906, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1gqzhtg/aws_acm_for_internal_public_facing_cert", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 450, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "AWS ACM for internal & public facing cert?", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-11-14T06:41:18+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I would like to add a few internal cameras to my house to monitor the dog when we are away.</p> <p>I don&#39;t need AI recognition right now, just basic functionality to view the feeds from my phone</p> <p>I have a self hosted network up and going and use ZeroTier as my VPN, so I can access my local network</p> <p>* Can frigate run without the need for the AI detection?
