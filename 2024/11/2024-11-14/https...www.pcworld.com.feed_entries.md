<p>AMD may already have won this generation of desktop processors. But the company is convinced that you should also be turning to Ryzen processors for mobile gaming, as a series of AMD’s own benchmarks show the Ryzen AI 300 absolutely dominating.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2511540/amd-ryzen-7-9800x3d-review.html">AMD’s Ryzen 7 9800X3D is the clear-cut winner in terms of desktop gaming</a>. But a new blog post from AMD lays out how well the company believes it compares against Intel’s new Core Ultra 200 — the “Lunar Lake” processor — in terms of mobile gaming. AMD also didn’t hesitate to point out that its own HYPR-RX and FSR technologies give it a leg up over Intel’s XeSS, which only appears in a few games. </p>

<p>Early Black Friday deals on Thunderbolt docks have begun, and I’m on the hunt for the best docking station sales for the 2024 holidays.</p>



<p>It’s worth noting that Black Friday 2024 may be the last chance to buy a discounted dock for a while. In 2025, America’s new president has promised tariffs that could reach 60 percent on Chinese goods, and a number of smaller dock manufacturers are headquartered in China. (Larger ones, however, have moved outside the country.)</p>



<p>I’m compiling the best early Black Friday deals on Thunderbolt docks at major retailers like Amazon, Best Buy, and elsewhere. I’ve listed each Thunderbolt dock deal below, followed by an explanation of why I picked them. (For more details, scroll down to the FAQ at the end that explains what to look for in a Thunderbolt dock and how much you should pay.)</p>

<p>We absolutely love seeing early Black Friday gaming laptop deals, but even then our jaws dropped when we spotted this one: <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/asus-tuf-15-6-gaming-laptop-intel-core-i7-with-16gb-memory-nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-1tb-ssd-mecha-grey/6573673.p?skuId=6573673">a superb Asus TUF 15 config for just $1,000 at Best Buy</a>. That’s a $400 discount!</p>



<p>This Asus laptop features an Intel Core i7-13620H processor and 16GB of DDR5 RAM, so you’re going to be able to run pretty much any app or game and multitask like a pro. If you feel the 16GB isn’t enough, you can swap out the two RAM sticks and upgrade to 32GB later.</p>



<p>But the best part is that this laptop features a Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 GPU, which is <em>fantastic</em> at this price. It’s rare for an RTX 4070 laptop to drop below a grand, so consider this akin to a mi

<p>Black Friday is looming on the horizon and we’re already seeing some amazing discounts. In fact, you can stock up on your favorite gaming gift cards since quite a few of them are 10 percent off right now.</p>



<p>Amazon has $100 PlayStation Store gift cards <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-Store-Gift-Card-Digital/dp/B00K59HKIQ/">down to $90 right now</a>.

<p>When power users get a new PC, sometimes they like to start fresh — so they pull the pro gamer move of re-installing Windows with a fresh ISO image direct from Microsoft that has no pack-in bloatware and no unnecessarily elaborate “driver management programs” from the manufacturer. That wasn’t an option for the more specialized build of Windows 11 on the new Snapdragon laptops… until now.</p>



<p>Thanks to the Arm64-based hardware, which is different from the usual x86 and x64 guts you’re used to in most laptops and desktops, the build of Windows 11 on these new laptops is unique. It took a few months, but Microsoft has finally published a disk image (or ISO file) for these devices. You can now <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows11arm64">download it directly from Microsoft’s website</a> to set up a direct reinstallation or

<p>Early Black Friday deals on Chromebooks have begun at Amazon, Best Buy, and other retailers. I’m on the hunt for the best Chromebook sales, and I’ve already found some worth snatching up.</p>



<p>Black Friday 2024 could be weird. America’s new president is promising 60 percent tariffs on goods coming from China next year, which will raise prices across all kinds of categories, including electronics. Should that happen, snapping up a Chromebook deal now would be prudent.</p>



<p>I’ve listed the best Chromebook deals that I can find, followed by an explanation of why I think you should buy them. I’ve been tracking Chromebook deals during Black Friday for the past several years, so I have a good idea of what to buy and how much you should pay.

<p>Mini PCs are <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2079827/i-switched-my-desktop-for-mini-pc-and-regret-nothing.html">all the rage right now</a>. And why not?

Before you get another laptop, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2419994/reasons-why-you-should-get-a-mini-pc-instead-of-a-laptop.html">you should really consider a mini PC</a>.</p>

<p>Microsoft has been rolling out a steady stream of new features in various beta versions of Windows 11, but now there will be a slight pause on them. Namely, the company has <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/november-12-2024-kb5046617-os-build-26100-2314-1fa61a6d-a99a-47ca-a169-6974f08c3a0b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that it will not be rolling out any new update to the beta version of the operating system in December.</p>



<p>The reason for this is simply that Microsoft is slowing down during the festive season. Windows 11 updates with new features will continue to be rolled out at the same old pace when employees return to work after the New Year.</p>

<p>The official Raspberry Pi USB 3 Hub features four USB-A 3.0 ports, which are backwards compatible with USB 2.0, plus an extra USB-C port that can power the hub if required. The new hub is compatible with all Raspberry Pi models and connects via a USB-A 3.0 connector on an integrated 8cm cable. It’s also small enough to fit in your pocket.</p>



<p>Raspberry Pi boards come with a number of USB ports already, but some users have demanded more connectivity. With the new USB hub you can go to town by connecting up to four extra devices – everything from cameras and sensors to IoT devices if you wish.</p>

<p>According to the <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/os-version-market-share/windows/desktop/worldwide">latest Statcounter figures</a> for Windows desktop market share by version, Windows 10 is still the most widely used by a long shot.

<p>So, even though Microsoft clearly wants to <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2347757/how-microsoft-wants-to-urge-users-to-switch-to-windows-11.html">push Windows 10 users to Windows 11</a>, the company still has great incentive to keep working on the older version (<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1801718/windows-10-wont-receive-any-more-feature-updates.html">despite ending official support soon</a>).</p>

<p>The alphabet begins with the letter A, but the first drive on a reasonably up-to-date Windows computer is labeled “C:”. Why is that?</p>



<p>First of all, the naming of the first Windows drive is not because Windows is written in the <a href="https://www.pcwelt.de/article/1168229/tiobe-c-ist-programmiersprache-des-jahres-2017.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">C programming language</a>, as has been assumed <a href="https://stackoverflow-com.translate.goog/questions/531576/why-is-windows-giving-my-hard-disk-the-letter-c-and-not-a-or-b-for-example?_x_tr_sl=en&_x_tr_tl=de&_x_tr_hl=de&_x_tr_pto=rq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.
