## GPTree: Towards Explainable Decision-Making via LLM-powered Decision Trees

Traditional decision tree algorithms are explainable but struggle with non-linear, high-dimensional data, limiting its applicability in complex decision-making. Neural networks excel at capturing complex patterns but sacrifice explainability in the process. In this work, we present GPTree, a novel framework combining explainability of decision trees with the advanced reasoning capabilities of LLMs. GPTree eliminates the need for feature engineering and prompt chaining, requiring only a task-specific prompt and leveraging a tree-based structure to dynamically split samples. We also introduce an expert-in-the-loop feedback mechanism to further enhance performance by enabling human intervention to refine and rebuild decision paths, emphasizing the harmony between human expertise and machine intelligence. Our decision tree achieved a 7.8% precision rate for identifying "unicorn" startups at the inception stage of a startup, surpassing gpt-4o with few-shot learning as well as the best hum

A video about making sub-pixel art? I don't know what's wrong with me, ha ha.

I started making this video awhile ago, but I ran out of steam half-way through. Nevertheless, I forced myself to finish it. I hope you get something out of it. I also hope that it still applies somewhat to the current state of computer screens, but I may be too out of date.

For the record, this isn't supposed to be the ultimate video on sub-pixels. There's certainly more that could have been said about the subject. It's just supposed to be fun : )

Researchers have developed a ligand-protected direct hydrogen reduction strategy to prepare zeolite-confined Pt-Pd bimetallic cluster catalysts. These catalysts efficiently facilitate hydrogen production from ammonia borane (AB) solvolysis and the tandem hydrogenation of nitroarenes. In this tandem reaction, AB undergoes hydrolysis at the platinum sites to generate active hydrogen species, which are then transferred to neighboring palladium sites to reduce nitroarenes.
