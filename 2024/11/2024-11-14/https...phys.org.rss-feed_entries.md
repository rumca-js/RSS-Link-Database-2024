NASA's Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope is one giant step closer to unlocking the mysteries of the universe. The mission has now received its final major delivery: the Optical Telescope Assembly, which includes a 7.9-foot (2.4-meter) primary mirror, nine additional mirrors, and supporting structures and electronics. The assembly was delivered Nov. 7. to the largest clean room at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, where the observatory is being built.

Whether it's a hungry child in a war zone or a polar bear on a shrinking raft of ice, we're all familiar with shocking images in advertising. Companies use them to confront us with difficult emotions or go against societal norms as a means of grabbing our attention. Dettol, for example, once created an advertisement for its hygiene products that depicted a bloodied hand in front of the body of a man with a knife through his chest, alongside the words "When ordinary soap just won't do."

## Fine-tuning fertilizers to boost crop yields: Lowering fertilizer pH can increase solubility, availability of zinc

Worldwide, many agricultural soils are deficient in the nutrient zinc—despite the fact that farmers use fertilizers enriched with the element. This limits crop yields and reduces food quality. It's estimated that roughly a third of the global population consume foods low in zinc, which can increase sickness and death in early childhood, as well as impaired growth and cognition.

Carbon markets play a critical role in firms' and governments' climate strategies by enabling the purchase and sale of carbon credits. These credits represent a specific amount of carbon emissions (CO2) that has been mitigated through projects, such as avoiding deforestation or destroying potent greenhouse gases. These credits help organizations and countries meet their climate targets by offsetting a portion of their own emissions.

The Atacama Desert, which runs along the Pacific Coast in Chile, is the driest place on the planet and, largely because of that aridity, hostile to most living things. Not everything, though—studies of the sandy soil have turned up diverse microbial communities. Studying the function of microorganisms in such habitats is challenging, however, because it's difficult to separate genetic material from the living part of the community from genetic material of the dead.
