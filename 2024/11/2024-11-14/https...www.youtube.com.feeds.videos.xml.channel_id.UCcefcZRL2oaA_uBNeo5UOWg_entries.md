There's an ongoing debate about whether AI scaling laws will hold or hit a wall in the near future. However, what's clear now isÂ today's models already have the power to increase productivity in ways that would have been unimaginable even a few years ago. In this episode of the Lightcone, we dig into the results of a recent o1 hackathon hosted by YC to find out what can be unlocked when founders leverage a SOTA reasoning model.
