<p>These times are very trying and it’s understandable if someone goes a little off the deep end once in a while. Just like Norman Bates said in <em>Psycho, </em>“We all go a little mad sometimes.” However, a new Xbox ad campaign has us a little concerned.</p>
<p>Microsoft launched a new marketing campaign for its Xbox consoles and cloud gaming service called “This is an Xbox.” It features posters and commercials with a bunch of different objects like a laptop, a smartphone and a Meta Quest 3 that are all “an Xbox.”</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>We confirmed with a thorough fact check that all of those objects are not an Xbox. That may sound like overkill but when you live in a world where there’s a real chance that the goopy mass voiced by Tim Curry in <em>FernGully </em>might become Secretary of the Interior, we’re not taking any chances.</p>
<p>The commercial is even trippier. It zips between objects like a flat screen TV, an ROG Ally and a laptop while Black Sheep’

Today, NVIDIA released a trailer giving fans a behind-the-scenes look at Orbifold Studios' efforts to apply more modern graphics tools to the iconic title.

They have examples of how they're creating more dynamic light sources, volumetric fog in moody areas, and full 3D detail on the objects in the environment.</p>

The company says the Regulation on Transparency and Targeting of Political Advertising has an overly broad definition for political advertising and raised concerns that technical guidance around the policy may not be given until close to October 2025, when the rules will take effect.</p>

<p>Valve’s Steam store is more than just a place to buy computer games online. It’s an active community of gamers. Unfortunately, a sizable portion of those gamers are posting an “unprecedented” amount of hateful, racist and anti-Semetic content on the gaming site’s cyber social gathering place Steam Community, according to a report from the <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.adl.org/resources/report/steam-powered-hate-top-gaming-site-rife-extremism-antisemitism">Anti-Defamation League</a>.</p>
<p>The organization found 1.83 million unique pieces of “extremist or hateful content” from 1.5 million unique users in 73,824 groups. The content included “explicitly anti-Semitic symbols” and “tens of thousands of instances” of users showing support for foreign terrorist groups. The online gaming community even included an alarming number of “copypastas,” more than half of which were variations of Nazi swastikas.</p>

<p>Amazon and PBS have entered a partnership that will bring content from the public media operation to Prime Video. More than 150 local PBS channels and the PBS Kids Channel will launch as a free ad-supported TV (or FAST) offering on Prime Video over the coming months. The <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.pbs.org/about/about-pbs/blogs/news/pbs-and-amazon-to-launch-local-pbs-stations-and-pbs-kids-fast-channels/"><ins>press release</ins></a> from PBS noted that this is the first time this collection of programming will be available on a major streaming service for free.</p>
<p>PBS Distribution is also launching two new FAST channels that will be available exclusively on Prime Video for a limited time beginning November 26.

Think again. The company just announced the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://teenage.engineering/store/op-xy/">long-rumored OP-XY groovebox</a>. It looks like an OP-1 Field, but plays like the relatively-ancient OP-Z. It also costs $2,300.</p> 
<p>The OP-XY is described by the company as an "all-in-one powerful synthesizer and composer with deep, direct sequencing capabilities.” That sounds about right. The primary workflow here is sequencing, as opposed to the faux tape recording found with its OP-1 siblings. The groovebox features a shrunken-down keyboard and a strip of 16 LED-equipped buttons to control the sequencer.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has started the process of placing Google under federal supervision, an action which could create new standards for how the federal government can oversee big tech if the effort is successful. Falling under the CFPB's supervision would subject Google to regular inspections and scrutiny, although the exact aims of the department's efforts have not been fully disclosed. However, it has been an ongoing project for some time, as sources told <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/11/14/cfpb-google-federal-supervision/" data-original-link="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/11/14/cfpb-google-federal-supervision/"><em><ins>The Washington Post</ins></em></a> that Google has been fighting against this move by the CFPB for months.</p>

The Fire TV Omni Mini-LED series is being advertised as “the most powerful and innovative Amazon-built TV yet.” Let’s take a look at some specs.</p> 
<p>These TVs all include QLED Mini-LED panels that deliver up to 1,400 nits of peak brightness and up to 1,344 dimming zones. They offer support for Dolby Vision IQ and HDR10+ Adaptive, which should result in “more vibrant colors, deeper blacks, and richer contrast.”</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>Amazon says these sets include AI-assisted Intelligent Picture technology, which automatically enhances image quality to optimize scenes “in real-time.” The TV’s light and color sensor take the living space into account, making the appropriate brightness and color temperature settings as needed.</p>

<p>We don’t speak for all moms, but a brief and unscientific survey has confirmed one gift most moms will love across the board: Time. Unspoken for, unstructured, zero-obligation time. While we couldn’t find extra hours on sale anywhere online, we did find some gadgets and gizmos that help save time and others that make precious down time more enjoyable. Our recommendations include some of the gifts we’ve given to the moms in our own lives as well as what the moms on staff would want for themselves. Most have a tech bent, because we are who we are, but all should appeal to any mom who wants to make the most of their time.</p>

<p>The new features, which will be available “over the coming weeks,” will be added to Snapchat’s <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/snapchat-family-center-040146796.html"><ins>Family Center</ins></a>, the app’s portal for parental control features.

<p>Xbox is thinking about future hardware, and it might not just be another box attached to your TV. Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer told <em>Bloomberg</em> the team is considering its <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox-is-considering-a-pc-gaming-handheld-165515761.html">own gaming handheld</a> — but it’s years away.</p>
<p>In an earlier interview with <em>IGN</em>, Spencer had mentioned a hypothetical “Xbox gaming handheld PC device,” which now appears to be in the early research and prototyping stage. The Xbox boss said local play would be important to include if Xbox were to design a handheld console. Compared to existing devices, like the Steam Deck, ROG Ally and Legion Go, it’s unclear what unique features an Xbox handheld might offer.</p>
