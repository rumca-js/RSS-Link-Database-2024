## Remix culture – why not just normalize uploading an editable CAD format alongside your STL?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>It kind of blows my mind that this isn&#39;t just the standard procedure when sharing a model on sites like Printables or Thingiverse. These communities encourage remixing models, yet the hoops you have to jump through to actually modify an STL are barely worth it.</p> <p>The method I have used to some (limited) success is importing the mesh into Fusion, generating face groups, and then converting the mesh to a solid that I can work with. The problem is that Fusion (paid version, btw) fucks this process up with anything other than VERY basic models. Anything with threads, forget it.</p> <p>I have scoured the internet and tried all sorts of solutions for this, using various free &amp; paid software, and they basically all suck for even moderately complex models. Nobody ever does a tutorial with a model that I couldn&#39;t just re-create myself faster than converting someone else&#39;s STL to a format I can edit.</p> <p>With how far the 3D printing com
