<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Christmas is coming up, and my partner is a SAHM who absolutely loves to read, but her vision is not what it used to be and regular font books are getting harder to read over a few hours and she&#39;s hinted, not veeeeery subtly, that she would like to look into getting a Kindle soon, especially as she&#39;s in a few book clubs and can buy them on Kindle. For those who have one, is the Signature worth the upgrade from the regular Paperwhite? I&#39;m a Luddite, and refuse to switch to Kindle until all my TBR pile is read first, but I know she would really like this and I want to make the right choice for her.

Super sharp and to the point, and makes a hell of a point. My knowledge of Asimov went from learning about him as a physicist, then this opinion piece, and then reading his books and short stories. I think it&#39;s ironic that for all the sci-fi he wrote, this political opinion piece maybe aged the best as things currently feel lol. </p> <p>Nightfall was really damn good though now that I think about it...

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I want to preface this by saying that this review is based on my own thoughts and experiences and do not reflect those of every Christian. I just made this post because being familiar with the Bible gives the book a whole other layer which I found interesting. </p> <p>So I went into this book completely blind without reading any reviews or discussions on it. I had heard of The Handmaid’s Tale before but literally did not know anything about it…which is surprising considering how popular the book is. Because of this, I was so lost until like the first quarter of the book when things had began to unfold. Once I got the hang of what was going on, I was shook. I loved Atwood’s use of non-linear storytelling. Although this made it difficult to follow the story at some point, I still think it was such a great way to keep the suspense and interest throughout the book. </p> <p>I was shocked at how real the book is. This book was written decades ago but still

First, my version only references the Commonwealth of Virginia, whereas one of the criticisms I saw was that the author called it the State of Virginia. Additionally, multiple people referenced a part in the beginning where Adam felt Kelly being wet and wiping his hand on his pants before he knew she was dead. This part never happened in the version I read. </p> <p>I massively disliked the book, but I&#39;m curious about this.
