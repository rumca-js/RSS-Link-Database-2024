<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’m having a persistent issue with my Raspberry Pi Zero. Every time I boot it up (with a monitor attached), it keeps asking me for the WiFi password. I enter the correct password, but after a few seconds, the password prompt reappears as if nothing happened.</p> <p>Here’s what I’ve tried so far: • Used multiple WiFi networks (same issue on all of them). • Tried different power cables, thinking it might be a power issue. • Re-flashed the OS image several times, but the problem persists.</p> <p>Still, the issue remains. Has anyone else encountered this, or have any suggestions on what might be going wrong? I’d appreciate any help or advice!</p> <p>Thanks in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ReviewResponsible188"> /u/ReviewResponsible188 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1gr75yi/raspberry_pi_zero_keeps_asking_for_wifi_password/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <
