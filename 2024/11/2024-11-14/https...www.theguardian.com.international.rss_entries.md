The sink was filled with dishes and glasses and mugs. The garbage wasn’t full, but the plastic tub needed a wash. Coffee grounds littered the bottom … the place had a smell to it. Not foul-smelling but there was a&nbsp;smell, and I won’t be so delusional as to say it was a good one.” In this lean, serious, impressive novel, desire for orderliness and cleanliness is pointed, with these states literally and metaphorically out of Charles’s desperate reach.</p><p>Because while T

Will Everett’s readers offer up the English equivalent, murmuring “Darling, you were marvellous” before moving swiftly on? Well, the collection certainly delivers what Everett’s fans will be hoping for: quality time in his inimitable company. But it also delivers much more. Sometimes, it is simply the energy and poise of the prose that arrest one’s attention; often, it is Everett’s combination of studied carnality with an outlandish gift for invention. This is a storyteller unafraid to spike his black comedy with sudden and strongly brewed emotion – and vice versa.</p><p>In his frequent interject
