<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Listening to Throwback Thursday and think Don’t Speak by No Doubt has to be up there as one of the best ever, the song feels so raw and the lyrics must have been painful for Gwen to record and then tour when the person who made her feel that way (Tony, bassist) is there the entire time (he offered to leave the band but they made it work). Same for most of Fleetwood Mac’s Rumours era (Go Your Own Way in particular).</p> <p>It made we wonder what’s your favourite break up song based on how it makes you feel, or the story around it? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/kteatray"> /u/kteatray </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1gr2p6d/best_break_up_songs_that_make_you_feel_it/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1gr2p6d/best_break_up_songs_that_make_you_feel_it/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Listening to the new Cure album left me really impressed by just how well Robert Smith’s vocals have held up for more than 40 years at this point. Not only have his vocals not lessened in quality, but they haven’t changed in any way at all. His voice just as clean, youthful, and melancholy as it was in the 80s. I can’t think of any other singer that this is true for. Even Thom Yorke, who I think has remained an amazing singer throughout his entire career, has at least had some changes to his voice over time. I don’t think hes gotten worse in any way, but his voice is certainly deeper, raspier, and more aged these days. It sounds really great still and I think the changes suit his sound quite well. But Robert Smith doesn’t even seem to have had any changes in his voice for the entirety of his career</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/LSD4President"> /u/LSD4President </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://
