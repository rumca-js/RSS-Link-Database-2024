Hello guys and gals, it's me Mutahar again! I have to preface this by saying Piracy is wrong and when it comes to new supported releases it's always beneficial to support a development team to see our hobby flourish. When it comes to older games that have long been abandoned it may be the only thing that keeps our history from disappearing into the void. Thanks for watching!
