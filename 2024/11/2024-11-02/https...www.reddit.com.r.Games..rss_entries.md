## A time when a game went for something big and failed?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>A lot of my favorite games of all time have really stand-out moments that rely on big gambles with their design; Dishonored 2’s mission “A Crack In The Slab” comes to mind.<br/> It’s a mission that introduces an entirely new system: you’re given a device that transports you between timelines. You can also <em>see through</em> the device into the alternate timeline at any time, so you’re effectively playing two immersive sim levels at once. It’s completely insane. Arkane went for something crazy and unique for that level, and they nailed it.<br/> Thinking about this has me curious though: Has a game ever swung for a big, unique gameplay moment, <em>but failed?</em> </p> <p>I know there has to be an example or two out there at the very least, but I can’t think of one.<br/> Maybe “No Russian”? I know people are mixed on that one. Although I’d personally argue that moment was pretty effective for what it was attempting, ie setting up the villain of MW2-3
