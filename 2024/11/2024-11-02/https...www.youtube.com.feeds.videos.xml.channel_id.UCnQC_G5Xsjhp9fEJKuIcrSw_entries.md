Tonight on Ben After Dark, Ben dives into the latest political carnival: Biden takes a swipe at Trump supporters, Kamala‚Äôs back with another highlight reel of gaffes, and AOC‚Äôs got some spicy takes on Doug Emhoff. But the Halloween chills don‚Äôt stop there: Miami‚Äôs new Dwyane Wade statue looks like it‚Äôs auditioning to eat trick-or-treaters, their candy, and, quite possibly... Ellen Page. Buckle up, folks; it‚Äôs going to be a wild ride!

This week on the Sunday Special, Ben Shapiro welcomes Dr. Paul Kengor, a distinguished political scientist, author, and expert on communism and Ronald Reagan‚Äôs presidential legacy. In today‚Äôs episode, we dissect the infiltration of Marxist ideas among American progressives, the ideological crux of a Marxist‚Äôs worldview, and whether or not Kamala Harris can be classified as a Marxist herself. We also examine the similarities and differences between the presidencies of Ronald Reagan and Donald Trump, and how American conservatives can lead the way toward a less divisive future. Don‚Äôt miss this important conversation with Dr. Paul Kengor, on this episode of the Sunday Special.
