## One thing about us developers is that we not business people so if you have experience working at a failed startup, what are some signs to look out for to see if you in a sinking ship?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>As someone that has worked in a startup that did not do well. I think the signs were there when we client requests were inconsistent. We would serve a client there and there but there was no project that lasted a long time cause usually the service we provided would be complete in a month or 2. The company was funded to build a product so we can transition from providing a service to providing a Saas product but when the investors pulled out that&#39;s when it hit the fan that client work revenue was not enough to run a company and we were surviving off funding.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Themba47"> /u/Themba47 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/1ghzv3w/one_thing_about_us_developers_is_that_we_not/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/1ghzv3w/one_thing_about_us_developers_is_that_we_not/">[comments]</a></span>
