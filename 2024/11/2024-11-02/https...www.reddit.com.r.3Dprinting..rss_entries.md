## Just got my first 3d printer yesterday and this is my first project. I'll probly need to reprint, I just found out that PLA is not good for outdoor use, so might as well ask yall how I can make this better. I tried to get the best angle and this what I ended up with.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I bought a VEHO-600 about 3 months ago, and it&#39;s been a nightmare trying to deal with it and the company. They ignore me all the time, refuse to send replacement parts, the engineering is absolutely terrible, with major fundamental design flaws everywhere. Parts jam and fail, holes are in the wrong place. I paid for a replacement extruder and waited for it to arrive - and it turns out they sent me the wrong one! I strongly suspect from the manuals and pictures that they sent me some old obsolete printer, for which they no longer have replacement parts. Which wouldn&#39;t be an issue if they did their engineering right and used standard widely available parts instead of trying to make everything custom and then doing a bad job so it doesn&#39;t work and can&#39;t be fixed. </p> <p>I&#39;ve spent almost 1.5 months working on this machine and have only gotten 2 prints out of it.
