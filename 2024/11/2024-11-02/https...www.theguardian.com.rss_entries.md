## Marc Guéhi strikes for Crystal Palace to deny Wolves first league win of season

<p>How many more chances will Gary O’Neil get to earn that elusive first league win of the season? Wolves, who deservedly trailed to Trevoh Chalobah’s opener, contrived to squander a second-half lead after two goals in five minutes from Jorgen Strand Larsen and João Gomes had turned the tables on Crystal Palace. Perhaps Wolves were guilty of thinking the hard work was done.</p><p>For long spells Wolves played like a team down on their luck and given they sacked their first set-piece coach last month, it was not a great look for O’Neil that both Palace goals came from dead balls, Marc Guéhi eluding his marker, the substitute Gonçalo Guedes, at a corner to earn a point. In the end – unusually – O’Neil was grateful for VAR, who backed up the referee Anthony Taylor’s decision to disallow Jean-Philippe Mateta’s 96th-minute strike for a foul on José Sá. Critically, though, O’Neil may have lost the support of the locals.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/02/wolves-c

<p>Rachel Reeves’s spending plans signal a welcome break with the past and underline the scale of the challenges facing Britain</p><p>The first Labour budget in 14&nbsp;years introduced some much-needed honesty on the requirement for higher taxes and borrowing in an ageing society characterised by sluggish economic growth and a deteriorating public realm. This allowed Rachel Reeves to earmark essential resources for schools and hospitals, and to increase levels of public investment to secure future growth. That this budget had no hope of being a magic bullet for Britain’s economic woes, however, is no reflection of Reeves’s lack of ambition, but a sign of just how bad the problems she inherited are.</p><p>The Conservatives’ approach to the economy has made the longstanding issues that have for decades plagued the UK worse. Through cutting back the state while doling out tax cuts to affluent households, then pursuing a hard Brexit, successive Conservative prime ministers have caused h

Yet the manner of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/nov/02/kemi-badenoch-wins-tory-leadership-election">her victory in the Tory leadership contest</a> ought to give a worm of unease to the party’s new standard bearer. When the result came in on Saturday morning, the first reveal was that the membership of the Tory party has shrunk to 131,680, down more than 40,000 since the last contest two years ago. With the turnout also down on last time, she won with the support of just four in 10 of that shrivelled membership. Her lustiest cheerleaders cannot describe this as an emphatic victory. Even the truest of blues were not greatly impressed by the choice on offer for all the effort that she and Robert Jenrick put into trying to pander to their party’s prejud

<p>The perfect day looked far beyond Liverpool when they trudged off at half-time battered and bruised by an upwardly mobile Brighton. But a perfect day it proved for Arne Slot’s side, who climbed back to the top of the Premier League courtesy of a second-half transformation and another stupendous goal from the Mohamed Salah collection.</p><p>Salah curled a trademark winner into the top corner of Bart Verbruggen’s net, two minutes after Cody Gakpo had cancelled out Ferdi Kadioglu’s first half opener, to move ahead of Robbie Fowler as the eighth leading goalscorer in the Premier League era. More importantly, with Manchester City and Arsenal both losing, it moved Liverpool two points clear of the champions at the summit and seven above Mikel Arteta’s struggling side.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/02/liverpool-brighton-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

But since he’s hoping to be elected US president on Tuesday, it would be handy to know. Democrats describe him as “weird” and “unhinged”.

Its owner M&amp;G Real Estate is going to obliterate its pointy bits and “reimagine” its entrance, in order to create “a landmark in sustainable design”, and provide such things as a “tenant amenity village”, a roof terrace, and a “new cultural offer”. Also, perhaps most relevantly to their bottom line, they want to smother it in several extra floors of office space, to the extent that there will be little recognisable left. Last week, attempts to list this unique work having failed, ominous hoardings went up around it.</p><p>This building, which served as Cruella de Vil’s headquarters in the 1996 version of <em>101 Dalmatians</em>, got a mixed critical reception when it

This wasn’t just a matter of her background, which in turn became the currency of her live act – her childhood poverty (“a world of near Dickensian squalor”, as one Scottish newspaper described it), her marriage into a notorious Glasgow gangster family. Her career curve stands out too. Other comics build a reputation online, move into standup – then do something else. Godley did it all the other way round, taking up live comedy in her 30s, as a departure from (or, she would argue, extension of) her bar work. But she reserved her biggest splash for her 50s, with a series of viral videos that established her – and her broad Glaswegian comedy – at the very heart of Scottish public life.</p><p>My earliest experiences of Godley’s work were at the Edinburgh fringe, at which – as a middle-aged, working-class Glaswegian wom
