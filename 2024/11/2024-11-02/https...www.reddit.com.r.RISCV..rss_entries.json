I&#39;d like to get acquainted with WCH&#39;s small chips which seemingly are somewhat comparable to STM&#39;s ST32 low-end series.

ST32s had some &quot;boot&quot; pins to start up the built-in bootloader which allowed uploading simply with UART (so it was just a question of finding the tool to upload the hex file and figure out powering of the chip). With these WCH&#39;s pieces I don&#39;t see clear explanation about the process:</p> <p>- CH32V003 mention some boot &quot;system memory&quot; and that it is enabled by default, but no hint about protocol, tools etc.</p> <p>- CH32V203 says it will accept some loading with UART or USB, but also without details</p> <p>WCH-Link tool seemingly uses some different interface - but I don&#39;t understand whether it needs BOOT mod", "id": 1440156, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1ghrwon/how_to_flash_freshbought_wch_microcontrollers_eg", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 471, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "How to flash fresh-bought WCH microcontrollers (e.g. CH32V003 or CH32V203)?", "vote": 0}]
