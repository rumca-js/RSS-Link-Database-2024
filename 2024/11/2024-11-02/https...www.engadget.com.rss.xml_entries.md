<p>The <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://x.com/FBI/status/1852743285711761791" data-original-link="https://x.com/FBI/status/1852743285711761791">FBI</a> issued a statement on Saturday about deceptive videos circulating ahead of the election, saying it’s aware of two such videos “falsely claiming to be from the FBI relating to election security.” That includes one claiming the FBI had “apprehended three linked groups committing ballot fraud,” and one about Kamala Harris’ husband. Both depict false content, the FBI said.</p>
<p>Disinformation — including the spread of political deepfakes and other forms of misleading videos and imagery — has been a major concern in the leadup to the US presidential election. In its statement posted on X, the FBI added:</p>

<p>In a new security advisory, Okta has <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://trust.okta.com/security-advisories/okta-ad-ldap-delegated-authentication-username/">revealed</a> that its system had a <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/1/24285874/okta-52-character-login-password-authentication-bypass">vulnerability</a> that allowed people to log into an account without having to provide the correct password. Okta bypassed password authentication if the account had a username that had 52 or more characters. Further, its system had to detect a &quot;stored cache key&quot; of a previous successful authentication, which means the account&#39;s owner had to have previous history of logging in using that browser. It also didn&#39;t affect organizations that require multi-factor authentication, according to the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://x.com/kmcquade3/status/1852475962715246869">notice the company sent to its users</a>.&nbsp;</p>

The last week of the month was jam-packed with news, <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/everything-apple-announced-during-its-unofficial-mac-week-210115997.html">especially from Apple</a>, so we're in for a busy few weeks of reviews to finish out the year. This week, we tested Amazon's long-awaited color E Ink ereader, a DJI action cam that's finally a worthy GoPro rival and Google's latest tv-streaming device. Here's a quick round-up of the week's in-depth reviews, and a quick preview of what's to come in the post-Halloween deluge.&nbsp;</p>

If your phone isn&#39;t showing a preview when you use its rear camera, then you may be eligible to get your phone fixed at no cost — you can also contact Apple to get a refund if you&#39;d already paid for a repair. The affected devices were manufactured between April 10, 2023 and April 28, 2024, around half a year after the model started shipping in 2022.&nbsp;</p>
