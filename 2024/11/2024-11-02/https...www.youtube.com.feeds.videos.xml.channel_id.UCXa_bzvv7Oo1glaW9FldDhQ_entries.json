That initial image still burns the retinas but thanks to a recent flurry of gameplay previews and dev diaries we\u2019re a little closer to understanding what Slitterhead is all about (although there\u2019s still an element of \u2018what the hell is going on\u2019 with this one). \n\nThis video aims to unpack 15 things you need to know about this upcoming battle-action horror game before you hit that pre-order button.", "id": 1442365, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9Lvn7QebOQ", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 129, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/j9Lvn7QebOQ/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Slitterhead - 15 Things You NEED To Know Before You Buy", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-11-02T18:30:13+00:00", "description": "Horizon Zero Dawn easily stands tall as one of the best open-worlds of the recent console generation, and it surprisingly holds up well even to this day - both from a functional and a graphical perspective. \n\nAs such, the thought of remastering the game seems frivolous at first glance.

Very few are following up on a beloved trilogy of titles from a studio specializing in the same. Even fewer make sweeping changes to the combat, exploration, and more while going for a different atmosphere.\n\nThe results range from intriguing and enjoyable to somewhat baffling. While The Veilguard mostly excels with its combat, even as it takes time to open up in abilities, builds, and loot, the companions aren't BioWare's best. Then there's the story, which waffles between a predictable plot and disappointing cameos.\n\nThis isn't to say that The Veilguard is a disaster - far from it, as there's definitely a vibe to some of the interactions and exploring the different regions for what secrets they may hold. But it may not be everything that Dragon Age fans are looking for, much less competing with the best that the genre has to offer.", "id": 1438538, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2uvUZOlfL0", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 129, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/K2uvUZOlfL0/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Dragon Age: The Veilguad Review - Bioware's Greatest Or Just Another Middling Experience?", "vote": 0}]
