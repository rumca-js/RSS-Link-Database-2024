In today\u2019s episode, we dissect the infiltration of Marxist ideas among American progressives, the ideological crux of a Marxist\u2019s worldview, and whether or not Kamala Harris can be classified as a Marxist herself. We also examine the similarities and differences between the presidencies of Ronald Reagan and Donald Trump, and how American conservatives can lead the way toward a less divisive future.
