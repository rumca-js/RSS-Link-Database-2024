<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi, I have been researching over the last couple weeks about how to power a Pi5 with the 5v5a requirement in my van for some Ham Radio stuff... In many of the threads, people were very annoyed as it is a non standard power requirement. Suggestions were UPS style power bricks, buck converters, etc. I searched &quot;inverter&quot; in a few reddit communities and elsewhere and didn&#39;t really come up with anything other than people powering 3b+ off solar. So, my simple question is, other than ignition drop and draining my battery if my van isn&#39;t running, why would this following solution not work? I would use this 12v inverter (output is 115vac, 60hz, 160w/1.4a and then the official 27w usb-c power supply which requires a standard input of 100-240v 50/60hz 0.8a and outputs for the RPi5...the only thing that is raising my eyebrow is the non-sinusodal disclosure on the output of the inverter.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href
