In many of the threads, people were very annoyed as it is a non standard power requirement. Suggestions were UPS style power bricks, buck converters, etc. I searched &quot;inverter&quot; in a few reddit communities and elsewhere and didn&#39;t really come up with anything other than people powering 3b+ off solar. So, my simple question is, other than ignition drop and draining my battery if my van isn&#39;t running, why would this following solution not work? I would use this 12v inverter (output is 115vac, 60hz, 160w/1.4a and then the official 27w usb-c power supply which requires a standard input of 100-240v 50/60hz 0.8a and outputs for the RPi5...the only thing that is raising my eyebrow is the non-sinusodal disclosure on the output of the inverter.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href", "id": 1441193, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1ghx630/using_an_inverter_for_power_rpi5_5v5a", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 470, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Using an Inverter for power RPi5 5v5a", "vote": 0}]
