<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey guys i am an experienced programmer- proficient in JS, TS, React and new to python. I just noticed that i don’t like any of those languages as they appose no challenge.</p> <p>I have come to the realization that all of these languages are overused and over-saturated . I like the C programming languages and would love to be challenged as a programer.</p> <p>I hate looking for “the best libraries “ and so on. Instead i want to code something that has something meaningful. I like the idea of desktop applications, games and so on</p> <p>These todo apps and websites dont move me at all.. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Soft-Flow-7884"> /u/Soft-Flow-7884 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.sajjadalgburi.dev/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1ghy9ok/need_help_choosing_programming_language_jr_dev/">[comments]</a></span>
