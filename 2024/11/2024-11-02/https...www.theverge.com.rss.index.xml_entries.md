  <p id="NQdGr4">People have started receiving their orders of Amazon’s first color e-reader, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/16/24271632/amazon-kindle-colorsoft-specs-price-hands-on">Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition</a>, and many say they’re disappointed to find a yellow, discolored strip at the bottom of the display. Complaints about the $279.99 e-reader’s display have spread online and dragged down its Amazon star rating, and some report customer service reps say a fix is on the way.</p>

  <p id="wceMhO">Some of the most beloved roguelikes are single-player — the likes of <em>Hades</em>, <em>Balatro</em>, and <em>Dead Cells</em> are all solo titles. But <em>Windblown</em>, the new roguelike from Motion Twin, the studio that created <em>Dead Cells</em>, showed me just how cool it can be to play a roguelike with other people.</p>
