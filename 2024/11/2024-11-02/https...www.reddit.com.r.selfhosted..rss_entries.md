With Essential coming around, I feel like I have a reason to up the quality of my server, so I&#39;m looking for some ways to improve my setup. Right now I run my servers off a PowerEdge R720 with two 12-core 2.7 ghz Xeons and 96 gb of ram. The VM I have for them has 8 cores and 32 gb allocated, even though it&#39;s probably overkill. I have to use ngrok instead of forwarding because Xfinity doesnt work well with proxmox. It could be internet speed, I get ~600 mbps download and ~40 mbps upload, but I&#39;m not sure how that affects performance.
