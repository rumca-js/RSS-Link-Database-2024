<p>Microsoft has introduced its <code>Microsoft.Extensions.VectorData.Abstractions</code> library, now in preview. The library provides abstractions to help integrate vector stores into <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2264488/what-is-the-net-framework-microsofts-answer-to-java.html">.NET</a> applications and libraries.</p>



<p>The vector data abstractions library, introduced <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/introducing-microsoft-extensions-vector-data/">October 29</a>, provides library authors and developers with the ability to perform create-read-update-delete (CRUD) operations and use vector and text search on vector stores.</p>

<p>Application testing company Checkmarx has warned developers to be on the lookout for malicious NPM packages, after discovering a new attack that employs typosquatting to impersonate two popular packages.</p>



<p>Part of a much larger campaign against NPM, in a new twist, the malicious package eschews traditional command & control (C2) by using the Ethereum blockchain to hold the addresses of its malicious payloads.</p>



<p>The campaign targets two popular NPM (Node Package Manager) packages used as part of the Jest JavaScript testing framework, “<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/fetch-mock-jest">fetch-mock-jest</a>” and “<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest-fetch-mock">Jest-Fetc

<p>Java’s internal systems and syntax are constantly evolving, and these changes happen primarily through the Java Community Process (JCP) and Java Enhancement Proposals (JEPs). Together, the JCP and JEPs define the path by which new features can be described, designed, and—hopefully—introduced into the JVM. They keep the Java language and platform dynamic and the community engaged. With <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3491404/jdk-24-the-new-features-in-java-24.html">JDK 24</a> so close to its planned release date, now is a good time to take a look at the upcoming JEPs making their way through the process.</p>

<p>Most people are familiar with data in the form of a spreadsheet, with labeled columns of different data types such as name, address, age, and so on. Databases work the same way, with each table laid out according to a strict schema.</p>



<p><em>Dataframes</em> are structures used in data science that work like spreadsheet pages or database tables. Many common data science libraries use dataframes in some form—Spark, Pandas, Polars, and many more. But dataframes are far more efficient and powerful than working with databases through an <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2335617/sql-unleashed-9-ways-to-speed-up-your-sql-queries.html">SQL query</a> or reading an Excel spreadsheet via a l

<p>You would be hard-pressed to find a software manager who didn’t want to be “agile.” But I’m guessing that a vanishingly small percentage of them have actually read the<a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/"> Agile Manifesto</a>. And I’m guessing even fewer have given any real thought to <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3237508/what-is-agile-methodology-modern-software-development-explained.html">what agile means</a> and how it might be applied in the real world. </p>



<p>Sure, the Agile Manifesto is revered by software developers. Most of us feel like there is something there — some deep-seated truth that we all know. But the problem arises when we try to figure out the answer to the
