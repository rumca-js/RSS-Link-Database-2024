In this adventure, we're in Venezuela to camp in an abandoned fisherman shack.

Los Roques is an archipelago off the coast of Venezuela, famous for its turquoise waters, pristine beaches, and abundant marine life. Comprising over 300 islands and cays, it's a popular destination for kite surfing, diving, and eco-tourism, drawing adventurers and nature enthusiasts alike. 

The Palafito is a unique stilted lodge located in Los Roques, built over the water in traditional Venezuelan style. It's used as temporary lodging for fishermen during lobster season, and also seems like an epic place to camp.
