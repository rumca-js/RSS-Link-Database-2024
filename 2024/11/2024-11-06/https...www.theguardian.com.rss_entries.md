<p>Mikel Arteta’s problems keep on mounting. In the week that they were rocked by the surprise resignation of sporting director Edu, Arsenal surrendered their unbeaten record in the Champions League after Hakan Calhanoglu kept up his record of never having missed a penalty for Inter to score the only goal of a tightly contested game.</p><p>It was an exasperating occasion for Arteta, who was booked in the second half for handball and came close to being sent to the stands as his side searched for an equaliser. But despite a much-improved second-half display that saw the visitors rack up 13 corners to Inter’s none, they sank to a second successive 1-0 away defeat.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/06/inter-arsenal-champions-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>There was hardly a murmur as Emiliano Martínez took a routine goalkick five minutes into the second half and then, a few seconds later, huge cheers from those decked out in Club Brugge blue and black as the ramifications of Tyrone Mings’s brain freeze suddenly dawned on them. The defender mistakenly assumed Martínez had not restarted play and so scooped the ball up, placed it on the edge of the six-yard box and proceeded to pass the ball to his goalkeeper.<br><br>
 Only the German referee, Tobias Stieler, and most of this stadium, were convinced the ball was in play and penalised Mings, who had been booked in the first half, by awarding a penalty but stopped short of reaching for a second yellow card. Hans Vanaken sent the subsequent spot-kick down the middle and the 19-time Belgian champions had the lead, albeit in peculiar circumstances.</p><p>Two years to the day since Emery’s first game in charge of Villa, a 3-1 win over Manchester United, it is worth remembering how far they

I think it’s a unique experience, to be an immigrant watching it from afar. It feels like you’re watching your house burn down from across the street, with all your friends and family still inside. People say: ‘Oh,&nbsp;you’re so lucky not to be in the house that’s on fire,’ and you’re like: ‘No, that’s my memories, that’s the people I love, that’s the places I&nbsp;love.’ It’s a really painful experience to watch what you love being dismantled.”</p> <a href="https://www.the

<p>His resounding victory will be blamed on ‘populism’, but that’s lazy thinking. He addressed the key concerns far better than the Democrats did</p><p>Since we’ll hear a lot, again, about “populism”, let’s remember, again, that 19th-century US populism had a healthy strain of leftwing politics. Defending workers, riling up bankers, decrying the “cross of gold” and economic conservatism: look past his Bible-bashing, and William Jennings Bryan was a precursor to Franklin Roosevelt. Yet for much of this election year, the populists’ modern-day successors in the Democrats have served up an anti-populism: telling voters they were wrong.</p><p>Americans were told they were wrong to see the corrosion of Joe Biden’s abilities, and wrong to think that his replacement should not be decided in a giant backroom stitch-up.

<p>There is a long way still to go, but the government is taking action to end injustice in the treatment of severe mental illness</p><p>The 1983 <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1983/20/contents">Mental Health Act</a> provides for some extraordinarily coercive powers. A person with acute&nbsp;mental illness can be detained without their consent and sometimes forcibly removed from their home for that purpose. This is necessary when someone poses a danger to themselves or others, but that imperative must always be applied with clinical sensitivity and regard for fundamental rights. Mental illness is not a criminal offence.</p><p>Too often, the boundary between medical intervention and arbitrary detention has been blurred.

It even was the most popular Republican presidential campaign since 1988. There go four decades of academic research on far-right politics, which has confidently claimed that openly racist far-right parties could not win elections. While it is too early to explain Trump’s shockingly large victory, there is one thing I know for sure: Trump 2.0 will be nothing like Trump 1.0.

<p>Readers respond to ﻿Rafael Behr’s article on the rise of far-right and nationalist politics</p><p>Rafael Behr warns against relying on the cautionary lessons of the 1930s to address the current rise of far-right and nationalist politics (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/05/left-right-trump-harris-prisoners-political-nostalgia-extremism">Left, right, Harris, Trump: all prisoners of political nostalgia in an era few understand, 5 November</a>). Yet it is only by looking at the past that we can avoid repeating its mistakes. Yes, the 1930s shouldn’t be used as a stick to beat current-day nationalist supporters as deplorables.

<p><strong>Robert A Brown</strong> and <strong>Brian Murtagh</strong> respond to an editorial about this ‘antidemocratic relic of the 18th century’</p><p>The founding fathers built an imperfect system that, with lurches and stumbles, has survived since the US constitution was written in 1787. I’m sure even they would be surprised at their own success.

Giving small states (basically separate countries at the time) a disproportionate voice in the election of a chief executive was supposed to help prevent a majority from oppressing a minority. Due to unforeseeable circumstances, mostly based on modern economic and geographic factors, we now face an oppressive but empowered minority because of the electora

But come Wednesday morning most people in the UK were coming to terms with a very different reality. One where the majority of American voters – for whatever reason, economic or ideological – had chosen the candidate who was a known sexual abuser and convicted felon and whom former allies describe as a fascist. A known liar and narcissist who had actively tried to undermine the democratic process. A shallow, capricious man without filters who says and does what he likes. All of this was priced in – there were no surprises – but people love him for it. So the US has voted. The rest of us have to suck up the consequences.</p><p>But not everyone’s mind was on the fallout from the US election.

Contested by Corinthians and Palmeiras, rival sides in the Brazilian city of São Paulo, the most recent one was a league match played on Monday night and won 2-0 by Corinthians, whose striker Yuri Alberto scored one of their goals. However, the 23-year-old’s smart finish at the end of a lightning fast second-half counterattack wasn’t his only strike of note in the game. While the match was still scoreless with a little over 30 minutes played at Corinthians’ NeoQuimica Arena, Palmeiras were awarded a corner but before they could take it, Alberto trotted towards the sideline to boot a beanbag or pillow thrown from the crowd off the pitch.

He’d first met her in 1974, when he was 22 and she was starring in Snap, a comedy about venereal disease. His task was to drive her to and from the theatre and generally hold her hand, which he remembers as enthralling and terrifying.</p><p>But they hit it off: she trusted his taste and he went on to produce her in 10 plays over 22 years, including Lettice and Lovage and The Importance of Being Earnest. That was a huge hit back in 1993 – the year I met Robert – but Maggie famously loathed everything about it, from Nicholas Hytner’s direction to Bob Crowley’s sets. When asked by the Mail’s showbiz correspondent whether she’d take the show to Broadway, she responded: “Broadway? I wouldn’t take this to Woking!”</p> <a href="https://www.

She points out that pop charts around the world are infused with Africa-rooted music, from reggaeton, dancehall and hip-hop to African pop itself. “But who benefits from this music made from migration? How do we understand and credit the labour that goes into the beat of our culture?”</p><p>These vexed questions struck Elsisi when she came across a 2023 US lawsuit. Jamaican dancehall production duo Steely and Clevie alleged their 1989 track Fish Market originated the dembow rhythm that has since become a staple of reggaeton and countless pop productions. Over 1,000 songs using a version of that rhythm, some of them by the most streamed artists in the world including Bad Bunny and Drake, have been target

<p>He helped shape classic songs by the Rolling Stones, the Who and the Beatles but his influence on music has been largely ignored. A new documentary aims to correct that</p><p>In one of the Rolling Stones’ most crucial songs, Sympathy for the Devil, it’s not Keith Richards’ guitar that defines the melody or propels the piece. It’s a series of stark piano chords, struck by a studio musician, that give the piece its earth-shaking power. Likewise, in the Who’s classic cut The Song is Over, it isn’t Pete Townshend’s six-string that provides the song’s most plaintive tug. It’s a piano progression, provided by a guest player, that lends it that melancholy grace. Similarly, in Joe Cocker’s smash hit You Are So Beautiful, Cocker finds his dream partner in a series of guest piano runs so elaborate they change the trajectory of the melody, ultimately soaring it to the sky.</p><p>In each of those cases, the piano work sprang from the fertile mind and fleet fingers of Nicky Hopkins, a keyboard

<p>The comedy veteran is wasted as a grandad hosting Christmas early to keep his family from falling apart</p><p>Well-meaning parents Abbie (Lucy DeVito) and Jacob (Wilmer Valderrama) are planning to separate, and having consulted their therapist, decide the best way to break the news to their 10-year-old daughter is to have grandad Lawrence (Danny DeVito) do it for them, at his idyllic Dolomites resort. It doesn’t take Lawrence long to realise the kid is way ahead of them. “Did you notice any changes in your dad?” he asks. “Did he start weightlifting? Did he always wear jeans? Did he have perfect hair?”</p><p>The upshot – naturally – is that everyone agrees to stage Christmas in August. As far as the parents know, it’s a stunt for the benefit of their daughter: to have one last perfect Christmas before splitsville; while in their precocious progeny’s vision, fake Christmas will be the thing that glues mum and dad back together again. Things proceed amiably enough from there. Andie M

<p>Diagnosed with cancer in his 40s, the aid worker looks back on his life and offers advice on confronting death</p><p>You’re diagnosed with terminal cancer at the age of 46. How do you react? In all likelihood with rage, grief and self-pity, especially if, like Simon Boas, you were told it was only acid reflux, and cancelled scans and bureaucratic cock-ups further delayed treatment. You love your wife, you have a great job, you’re addicted to&nbsp;cheese fondue and muscadet, and&nbsp;death will take all that away. A&nbsp;nightmare, it seems, but far from bewailing his lot Boas tells us how insanely contented he feels and “how&nbsp;lucky it is to have lived at all”.</p><p>His book began as a trio of articles written for the Jersey Evening Post: he moved to the island (“one of the most caring, safe and close-knit communities in the world”) not as a&nbsp;billionaire tax-dodger but to be its director of overseas aid. The articles were plain about his impending death, though he had some

<p>Rumours of strain among players from former Yugoslavian states has surfaced before group stage meeting with Brest</p><p>For Sparta Prague there is plenty riding on Wednesday’s meeting with Brest. Nobody knows exactly what kind of tally will secure qualification for the Champions League knockout stages but a win would probably put them within touching distance of February’s playoffs. This is already their best European performance for more than two decades; they play in one of the most rapidly improving leagues, a fact that would be borne out if they emerge breathing from the sprawling 36-team bulk.</p><p>So it is far from ideal that their buildup has been troubled and, from another angle, symptomatic of a problem football stadiums across the continent cannot shake off. An inquest was inevitable when Sparta fell to a 3-1 home defeat against Banik Ostrava on Saturday, leaving them 10 points shy of the league leaders, Slavia, and severely minimising the chances of a third straight ti

<p>India’s favourite fresh cheese is such a versatile ingredient: try it scrambled and spiced, or cut into cubes, marinated in spices, then smothered in a terrific cashew sauce</p><p>Paneer, a fresh, unaged cheese, is a quintessential ingredient in Indian cuisine,particularly in the north of the country. This fresh cheese has always been cherished at my house for its ability to absorb spices and flavours, plus it doesn’t melt when heated, making it ideal for curries, snacks and even sweet dishes. It’s also a staple in Indian vegetarian cookery, not least because it’s a rich source of protein and calcium. According to some, paneer dates back several centuries. Some historical records suggest that paneer was introduced to India during the Mughal period, around the 16th century, possibly influenced by the Persian and Afghan rulers. There is also evidence that a form of paneer existed in ancient India – it’s mentioned in the Vedic texts, where it is referred to as <em>peynir</em>, derive

<p>Photographer Ana María Arévalo Gosen returned to Venezuela after eight years away, and began to document her country’s decline through the prism of women in the penal system</p><p>I left Venezuela in 2009, and when I returned in 2017, it felt like stepping into a different world. Prices had rocketed, hope for a better future had faded, and the infrastructure of what was once one of Latin America’s most promising nations was crumbling.</p><p>That year, I began <a href="https://anamariaarevalogosen.com/projets/dias-eternos/">the project Días Eternos [Eternal Days]</a>, driven by my need to explore one of the root causes of the crisis in my country: the perpetual breakdown of the penitentiary system.

<p>When I moved with my partner to Washington DC, it was months before I was granted a work permit. At first, my confidence took a hit. Then I felt liberated to start a new life</p><p>When my boyfriend asked if I would move with him from London to Washington DC in December 2017, I said yes right away. He had been offered a job there and I would need a spousal visa to join him, so we decided to get married. It felt like an adventure. We were young, child-free and had no real responsibilities. I was a freelance journalist and could plausibly work from anywhere, so why not Washington? Why not somewhere&nbsp;new?</p><p>I didn’t realise until we arrived, but the terms of my visa meant I&nbsp;wasn’t allowed to do paid work until I acquired the proper permit, which would take months. In the meantime, I was in limbo. At first, it felt like an extended holiday. But&nbsp;about six weeks in, the implications hit home.

The public is generally enthusiastic and environmental campaigners say there are gains for many forms of river life as a result. The retention of water in the landscape leads to a reduction in flooding and can protect against droughts.</p><p>However, not everyone is so impressed – particularly landowners and foresters, who complain of damage to carefully regulated watercourses and tree felling.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/06/beavers-have-made-a-comeback-in-britain-but-not-everyone-is-happy">Continue reading...</a>

We give it the celebration it deserves</p><p>I’m not sure I’ve ever sung Happy Birthday to a building before.

Their aim was to bring scattered, shattered rural communities together.
