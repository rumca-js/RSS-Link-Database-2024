​Donald Trump is anticipated to mobilise agencies across the US government to push for record levels of immigrant deportations, building on efforts from his first term to utilise all available resources and exert pressure on “sanctuary” jurisdictions to cooperate, according to six former Trump officials and allies. In a dramatic comeback, Trump defeated Democrat Kamala Harris, with Edison Research projecting the win and Trump declaring he had received an “unprecedented and powerful mandate.” Supporters, some of whom could join his administration, expect Trump will call on entities from the military to diplomats abroad to turn his campaign pledge of mass deportations into reality. His plans involve collaborating with Republican-led states and using federal funding as leverage over resistant areas.

Donald Trump secured a decisive victory in 2024, sweeping all swing states and defeating Kamala Harris by substantial margins. Polls had predicted a close race, but Harris underperformed even Biden’s 2020 results.

Mainstream media’s attacks on Trump only fueled his alternative media rise, appealing to minority voters disillusioned with Democrats. Trump's clear policy stances and minority outreach contrasted sharply with Harris’s unclear positions, leaving her vulnerable. The race highlighted persistent societal divides, with Harris’s identity perceived as a barrier for some voters.
