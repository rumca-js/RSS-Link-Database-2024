Researchers have developed feather-inspired passive flaps for aircraft wings, showing promising results. Wind tunnel tests revealed that these flaps could increase lift by 45%, reduce drag by 31%, and prevent stalls. By mimicking the structure of bird wings, these flaps respond naturally to airflow, enhancing flight performance. The flaps also expanded the safe flight angle range by 9%, improving stability and control, especially in turbulent conditions or short runway landings.

A skeleton found in Pommerœul, Belgium, shocked archaeologists when they discovered that it contained bones from at least five people, spanning from the Neolithic era to the Roman period. The bones were carefully arranged, possibly by the Romans who may have disturbed a Neolithic grave. DNA analysis and radiocarbon dating have confirmed the bones’ diverse origins, raising questions about the intent behind the burial, as researchers speculate that the Romans may have added to the burial due to superstition or cultural significance.

A study from the University of Plymouth and University of Bath raises concerns about bio-based fibres. While often marketed as eco-friendly, these fibres may cause greater ecological harm than conventional plastics. Exposure to viscose and lyocell, commonly found in clothing and wet wipes, resulted in high mortality rates in earthworms, crucial for soil health. The research calls for more comprehensive testing of these materials before they are widely adopted, as their environmental impacts are not fully understood.
