Breaking Bad will no doubt go down as one of the greatest television shows ever put on the air.  After 5 Seasons, and a spin off series in Better Call Saul, Breaking Bad has left a legacy very few have challenged on TV.   Walter White, Jesse Pinkman, Gustavo Fring, are just a few of the legendary characters created by Vince Gilligan that made the world of Breaking Bad feel as real as possible.  Fans across the globe were obsessed with Breaking Bad during it's run, and the fandom continued through Better Call Saul and El Camino.  But how did Vince Gilligan and company achieve such an impossible task?  Will any other show come close to capturing audiences the way Breaking Bad did during it's run?
