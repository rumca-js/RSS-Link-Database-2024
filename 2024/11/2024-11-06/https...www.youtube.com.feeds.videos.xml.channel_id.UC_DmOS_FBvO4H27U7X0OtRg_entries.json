Comprising over 300 islands and cays, it's a popular destination for kite surfing, diving, and eco-tourism, drawing adventurers and nature enthusiasts alike. \n\nThe Palafito is a unique stilted lodge located in Los Roques, built over the water in traditional Venezuelan style. It's used as temporary lodging for fishermen during lobster season, and also seems like an epic place to camp.\n\nWANT TO VISIT VENEZUELA?
