<p>A new AI feature is coming to Microsoft’s Notepad called Rewrite. <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/6/24289707/microsoft-notepad-ai-text-editing-rewrite"><em><ins>The Verge</ins></em></a> reports that Microsoft is rolling out a preview of Rewrite to Windows Insiders that will allow AI to rewrite sentences, change the tone and alter the length of text in Notepad.</p>
<p>Windows Insiders can access Rewrite by highlighting text in a Notepad window and right-clicking it in the menu or pushing the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+I. A dialogue box will open showing the AI’s suggested rewrites of the highlighted text and the adjustable features menus including “Longer,” “Tone” and “Format” above the “Replace” button. If you prefer to write with just your fingers and brain, you can turn off the AI feature in the app settings menu, according to <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2024/11/06/new-ai-experiences-for-paint-and-not

<p>OpenAI has scooped up a domain name that sounds like a logical fit. <em>TechCrunch</em> <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/06/openai-acquired-chat-com/" data-original-link="https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/06/openai-acquired-chat-com/">reports</a> that Chat.com, which was previously bought for over $15 million, is now in the hands of <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/openais-new-o1-model-is-slower-on-purpose-185711459.html">the ChatGPT maker</a>.</p>
<p>According to the domain history website who.is, Chat.com was first registered way back in September 1996. Before OpenAI’s acquisition, it last changed hands in 2023, when HubSpot co-founder and CTO Dharmesh Shah reportedly bought it for $15.5 million. We can speculate that the executive saw the burgeoning AI chatbot industry and the concise term’s potential for a big return. It was reportedly one of the top two pub

<p><em>Stardew Valley</em> on mobile just received its latest update, and in it is a new secret multiplayer mode. Developer ConcernedApe says it’s currently secret because of its experimental nature, and mobile multiplayer can be “frustrating.”</p>

They can still join a PC-hosted farm using their mobile devices. The developers also warn that using a mobile network isn’t recommended, as it may not be stable enough. The experience works best when both devices are on the same network, but that’s not compulsory.</p>

## The Morning After: Your Switch games will work on Nintendo’s next console

<p>You won&#39;t have to worry about repurchasing your Nintendo favorites when the Switch’s successor finally arrives. In its earnings report, Nintendo said its next console will have <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/youll-be-able-to-play-your-nintendo-switch-games-on-its-successor-045657774.html">backwards compatibility</a> and be able to run games made for the Switch. In addition, Switch Online will also be available on the Switch 2.</p>
<p>The earnings report takes a philosophical tone in talking about the why. Its online service, Nintendo Account, ties a user’s history to one account and enables the company, it said, to “maintain a continuous relationship” with them across console generations.</p>
<p>We’re all waiting: Nintendo downgraded its sales forecast for the fiscal year due to a big decline in console sales compared to last year.</p>

## PlayStation 5 Pro review: A superpowered $700 console for gamers who won't buy a PC

<p>It's pretty easy to tell if the PlayStation 5 Pro is for you. If you have no problems with the PS5's existing performance, if you balk at the $700 price tag, or if you don't have a modern 4K TV, you can just ignore this console entirely. But if you've been annoyed about losing graphical fidelity in 60 fps performance modes, or just want to avoid 30 fps gaming entirely, it could be the console you've been waiting for.</p> 
<p>There's no doubt that the PS5 Pro is a niche product, not an upgrade targeted at all PS5 owners. It's meant for the Sony devotees who want the absolute best PlayStation experience, and who will never upgrade to a gaming PC. After all, those rigs typically run well over $1,000 for similar graphics performance, and they also involve all the complexity of Windows PCs, like driver issues, OS instability and juggling multiple game storefronts.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>So sure, if you're eager to see what <em>Spider-Man 2 </em>looks like in 60 f
