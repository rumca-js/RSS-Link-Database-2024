<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am looking at implementing DarkRISV on a FPGA board I have had for a while as a winter project, I would like to have a working RISCV simulator to run along side of it for golden image files.</p> <p>There are many RISCV simulators out there, can someone recommend a simulator that is maintained and up to date.</p> <p>I have years of experience in ASIC design and a few FPGA&#39;s a long the way and RISCV looks compelling to embed into micro-code machine I have been tinking with in my spare time.</p> <p>Thanks ahead of time.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/guymadison42"> /u/guymadison42 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1gklrrw/riscv_simulator_and_darkriscv/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1gklrrw/riscv_simulator_and_darkriscv/">[comments]</a></span>
