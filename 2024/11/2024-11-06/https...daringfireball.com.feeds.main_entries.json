There\u2019s no way around that. It\u2019s different from 2016 in that it\u2019s not a shock. We all knew or should have known this was a very possible result. The polls and models were about as close to 50-50 as you can get. A number were literally 50-50. But there\u2019s another dimension of the story, assuming Trump does win. And that\u2019s this: everyone knows who Donald Trump is. He was already President once. We know what that was like. Paradoxically Kamala Harris and he both did a pretty good job reminding us who he was over the last month. So it\u2019s not like 2016 when you could say people didn\u2019t know what they were getting. We know who he is. If he wins, which now looks probable though not certain, that\u2019s a very sobering reality.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Strong d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu as acceptance sets in.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to \u2018Overnight Status Check\u2019\"  href=\"https://daringfireba", "id": 1461983, "language": null, "link": "https://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/status-check-before-midnight", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 29, "page_rating_contents": 90, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 489, "source_url": "https://daringfireball.com/feeds/main", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Overnight Status Check", "vote": 0}]
