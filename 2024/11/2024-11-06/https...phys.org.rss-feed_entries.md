Higher temperatures caused by anthropogenic climate change made an ordinary drought into an exceptional drought that parched the American West from 2020–2022. A study by UCLA and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration climate scientists has found that evaporation accounted for 61% of the drought's severity, while reduced precipitation only accounted for 39%. The research found that evaporative demand has played a bigger role than reduced precipitation in droughts since 2000, which suggests droughts will become more severe as the climate warms.

Nuclear physics theorists at the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Brookhaven National Laboratory have demonstrated that complex calculations run on supercomputers can accurately predict the distribution of electric charges in mesons, particles made of a quark and an antiquark. Scientists are keen to learn more about mesons—and the whole class of particles made of quarks, collectively known as hadrons—in high-energy experiments at the future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC), a particle collider being built at Brookhaven Lab.

High creatinine levels can suggest that the kidneys are not filtering waste efficiently. However, creatinine levels can be affected by a person's muscle mass and only rise significantly after more than 75% of kidney function is lost.

This era set the stage for the later emergence of complex multicellular life, marking a key chapter in evolutionary history.

In 1963, the Arecibo Observatory became operational on the island of Puerto Rico.

In December 2020, Arecibo's reflector dish collapsed after some of its support cables snapped, leading the National Science Foundation (NSF) to decommission the observatory.

Supersolids are a new form of quantum matter that has only recently been demonstrated. The state of matter can be produced artificially in ultracold, dipolar quantum gases. A team led by Innsbruck physicist Francesca Ferlaino has now demonstrated a missing hallmark of superfluidity, namely the existence of quantized vortices as a system's response to rotation. They have observed tiny quantum vortices in the supersolid, which also behave differently than previously assumed.
