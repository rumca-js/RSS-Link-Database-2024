Agatha All Along, reviewed by Joshua Yehl. Narrated by Stella Chung.

Agatha All Along may not top WandaVision, but it’s still one of Marvel’s stronger television efforts. Headlined by a powerhouse performance from Kathryn Hahn, the series takes us down the Witches’ Road for a spooky, fantastical journey unlike any other. Though the story is uneven and at times frustrating, it’s also an incredibly enjoyable thriller made all the more intriguing by a cast of colorful characters.

Over a decade has passed since a pathway called a "gate" which connects this world and another dimension suddenly appeared, and people with superhuman powers called "hunters" have been awakened. Hunters use their superhuman powers to conquer dungeons inside the gates to make a living, and Sung Jinwoo, a hunter of the lowest rank, is considered the Weakest Hunter of All Mankind. One day, he encounters a double dungeon, a high-level dungeon hidden inside a low-level one. In front of a severely wounded Jinwoo, a mysterious quest window pops up. On the verge of death, Jinwoo decides to take on the quest, which makes him the only person who can level up.

Here's our IGN Paddington in Peru review! Paddington in Peru explores odd and unnecessary territory for everyone’s favourite London-based bear, and in doing so fails to live up to the lofty bar set by its practically perfect predecessors. But thanks to winning performances from Ben Whishaw and Olivia Colman, this trip to the jungle preserves enough of the series’ sweet-natured fun to make it worth the somewhat sticky journey. Check out our Paddington 3 review to find out what we think of the new Paddington 2024 movie.

Paddington in Peru opens in UK cinemas on November 8, followed by US theaters on January 17, 2025.

Watch our IGN PS5 Pro review! The Sony PlayStation 5 Pro seems like it should be more exciting than it actually is. It's without question the most powerful console you can buy right now, and the PS5 Pro enhanced games I've been able to play ahead of launch do look great and run much more smoothly than the standard PS5 can handle. But it's also completely unsurprising that the faster PS5 is faster, and it's also more expensive. Considering that the original PS5 can still provide enough power to run games competently, spending $700 means you have to really want the best of the best from your games to make the PlayStation 5 Pro a worthy investment.
