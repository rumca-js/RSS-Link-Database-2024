<p>Tom Nichols, for The Atlantic:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Paradoxically, however, Trump’s reckless venality is a reason for
hope. Trump has the soul of a <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2024/10/donald-trumps-fascist-romp/680252/">fascist</a> but the mind of a
disordered child. He will likely be surrounded by terrible but
<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2024/01/donald-trump-2024-reelection-cabinet-appointments/676121/">incompetent people</a>. All of them can be beaten: in court,
in Congress, in statehouses around the nation, and in the public
arena. America is a federal republic, and the states — at least
those in the union that will still care about democracy — have

<p>Josh Marshall, signing off for the night:</p>

  <p>If Harris loses, that is obviously a crushing result. There’s no way around that. It’s different from 2016 in that it’s not a shock. We all knew or should have known this was a very possible result. The polls and models were about as close to 50-50 as you can get. A number were literally 50-50. But there’s another dimension of the story, assuming Trump does win. And that’s this: everyone knows who Donald Trump is. He was already President once. We know what that was like. Paradoxically Kamala Harris and he both did a pretty good job reminding us who he was over the last month. So it’s not like 2016 when you could say people didn’t know what they were getting. We know who he is. If he wins, which now looks probable though not certain, that’s a very sobering reality.</p>

<p>Strong déjà vu as acceptance sets in.</p>
