Arriving the day after Kamala Harris announced her bid for the presidency, Charli’s tweet said simply: “Kamala IS Brat.”</p><p>It was a reference to Charli’s latest album, which had dominated the pop cultural landscape all summer. Brat was loaded with synth-pop bangers, drug references and tales from a life spent getting messy on dancefloors, and it wasn’t perhaps the most obvious comparison to make with the then 59-year-old US vice president, but the overall meaning was clear: Kamala was the presidential candidate with the most energy and authenticity – and had the approval of the po

If the BBC is showing a 1974 episode of Call My Bluff, that’s what we’re watching</p><p>One thing led to another this week, and I spent some time with my mum.

Listings are scrutinised at the weekend and plans are drawn up. What she can’t watch at the time of broadcast, she records. I’ve pleaded with her, over and again, to engage with the streaming services – nowt fancy, just BBC iPlayer, ITVX and so on – but to no avail. The schedule is the schedule and her schedule must fit around that. Bring streaming into it, and the paralysis of choice is too much for her. It’s probably a bit too much for all of us

The event, at the O2 arena in London, was the culmination of a globetrotting five-week competition to discover the best team in the world. Never having attended before – mostly because the final is usually held in Asia, where the best players tend to come from – I wasn’t really sure what to expec

<p>After three straight defeats for Guardiola’s team, the run can be blamed on injuries but also some surprising tactics</p><p>With Kyle Walker’s knee injury meaning he was unable to apply his afterburners and torch any Sporting attack that broke Manchester City’s high line on Tuesday, Pep Guardiola’s men lacked the speed in their rearguard to counter how most opposition hope to prosper against them. Even with Walker in the side this classic way to break down the Premier League champions can be successful and with the captain an unused replacement at the Estádio José Alvalade, alongside Nathan Aké – and John Stones and Rúben Dias not fit enough to travel – a lack of defensive nous is also costing them.

<p>This tale of a female Scrooge discovering ‘the true meaning of Christmas’ will elicit copious tears … at the time you have wasted watching such drivel</p><p>It’s harder than you might think to find movies without any redeeming features, but occasionally they do come along. Terrible writing, horrible direction, an appalling script, dreadful performances: Holiday Twist really does have it all. Perhaps it would be fair to say the basic premise – a workaholic Scrooge figure is won over by the spirit of Christmas – is solid, but it’s hardly original.</p><p>As in A Christmas Carol, there are supernatural elements here, including an angel who intervenes to return a woman stricken with brain cancer to her family at Christmas. But more supernatural still is the surreal abrasiveness of the lead character, Connie (Kelly Stables), a recently divorced mum who also heads up a large corporate parcel-delivery company. She is a complete nightmare, but with none of the panto-villain charm of a prop

<p>A bona-fide queen of body horror delves into fears and illicit desires in this engrossing short-story debut</p><p>Disgust and delight, it has been said, live in close proximity; in Eliza Clark’s debut collection, they share a home and a bed. These 11 stories revolve around food, sex, gender, power and the body; they veer from realism to sci-fi, fairytale, horror and post-apocalyptic dystopia. This is a book that seems crafted from the stuff of our deepest fears and our most illicit desires. You read on, by turns engrossed and grossed out, as though in the thrall of some demonic power.</p><p>In one story, a tapeworm finds a&nbsp;happy home in the narrator’s belly, eating her dinners and keeping her weight in check (“Find me deliciously thin at a Michelin star restaurant, devouring a tasting menu with a wasp waist, never loosening my belt”).

<p>My mother showed me the importance of Indigenous and Afro-descendant women in protecting the natural world. Yet they continue to face barriers and discrimination in their work</p><p>I learned about the importance of women in small communities from my mother. She was a peasant woman – a <em>campesina</em> as we say in Colombia – in the mountains near Cali, where I grew up. She searched the forest for food and cultivated the earth to grow vegetables to feed me and my four siblings. It is women like her that I try to empower with my work supporting the collective rights of Indigenous and Afro-descendant women in Asia, Africa and Latin America.</p><p>In an era of environmental crises, people from such communities have an outsized role in preventing the destruction of nature and slowing the climate crisis.

But while this might seem like a screeching U-turn, it is nothing of the sort.
