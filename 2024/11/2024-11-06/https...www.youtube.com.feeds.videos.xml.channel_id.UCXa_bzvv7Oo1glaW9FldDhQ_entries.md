Every console generation has its mid-gen refresh, but sometimes, the "mid" is more pronounced than usual. Sony's PlayStation 5 Pro, launching on November 7th worldwide for $699.99, has generated no shortage of controversy in that regard, whether it's over the pricing, the lack of a vertical stand and disc drive, or similar CPU as the base version.

Whether it's more control over ray tracing features in Marvel's Spider-Man 2 and Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart, improvements to performance and resolution in Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, or somehow making Horizon Forbidden West look even better, it's certainly putting in the work.

But is PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution and advanced ray tracing truly worth it? How future-proof is the console considering the relative age of the technology and the inevitably PlayStation 6? Find out more here.
