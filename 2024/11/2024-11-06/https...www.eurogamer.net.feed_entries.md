Sorry, lovers of hats on pets; <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a> creator Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone has warned players to stop adorning their fluffy friends with fancy headwear, as doing so currently appears to be causing performance drops in the latest version of the farm life sim.

## Sony PlayStation 5 Pro review: across the board improvements, but is it worth the money?

<img src="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/eg-cover_MeqXQBj.jpg?width=1920&height=1920&fit=bounds&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp" /> <p>Is there an actual need for a mid-generation console upgrade for the PlayStation 5? More to the point, do the undoubted improvements offered by the end product represent good value bearing in mind the expensive &pound;699/$699/&euro;799 price-point? It's a tough question to answer - and all Digital Foundry can really do is attempt to showcase what the improvements actually are and offer our opinions on them. Beyond that, it's up to you. However, what's clear is that beyond any shadow of a doubt, PlayStation 5 Pro is the most powerful, forward-looking games console on the market right now. If you want the best PlayStation experience, this is it.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-sony-playstation-5-pro-review-across-the-board-improvements-but-is-it-really-worth-the-money">Read more</a></p>

Welcome back to our regular feature where we write a little bit about some of the games we've been playing over the past few days. We held the article back because it didn't make much sense without comments, so now that I'm publishing it, it means, yes, we have comments again. Thank you for patience surrounding the prolonged outage, and thank you for your continued patience with any teething problems we may have.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-weve-been-playing-comments-are-back">Read more</a></p>

## Can PS5 Pro run Elden Ring at 60 frames per second?

<img src="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/image_q7r5Jl8.png?width=1920&height=1920&fit=bounds&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp" /> <p>One of the most intriguing features of the PlayStation 5 Pro is complete compatibility with the existing library of PS5 titles - and the ability to run those games with the extra horsepower of the new hardware. So, in theory then, based on Sony's claims of an additional 45 percent of GPU performance, we should be in for a game-changing experience - games that don't hit their frame-rate targets should get there now - and there's one game renowned for its lacklustre technical quality: <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a>. Can the Pro fix the game where FromSoftware failed? The answer is almost, nearly, but not quite.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-can-ps5-pro-run-elden-ring-at-60-frames-per-second">Read more</a></p>

## AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D review: obliterating the competition

<img src="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/DSCF8632.jpg?width=1920&height=1920&fit=bounds&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp" /> <p>It's been a rough old time when it comes to benchmarking CPUs, I can tell you that. The Ryzen 9000 release <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-amd-ryzen-9-9900x-9950x-review">back in August</a> was let down by relatively meagre performance improvements and an unready software ecosystem, while Intel's 285K and 245K launch <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-intel-core-ultra-9-285k-ultra-5-245k-review">last month</a> showed a significant performance regression versus 14th-gen - despite a genuinely interesting shift in architectures. Thankfully, AMD is here to save the day with the Ryzen 9 9800X3D. </p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-amd-ryzen-7-9800x3d-review">Read more</a></p>
