Other times you just need a practical and affordable device that gets stuff done and serves you well, one that you don\u2019t have to worry about, one that you can happily pass over to the kids as needed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s what the Amazon Fire HD 8 tablet is all about, and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Fire-HD-8-Tablet-Black-32GB/dp/B0CVDN4QS6/\">right now it\u2019s on sale for just $55</a> \u2014 that\u2019s a whopping 45 percent off its original price of $100, making it one of the best-value tablet buys this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This 8-inch tablet is small enough to stash into your bag wherever you go, but still large enough for comfortable video streaming, web browsing, tablet gaming, and setting aside as an always-on display. With up to 13 hours of battery life, it\u2019s great for all-day entertainment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p", "id": 1464342, "language": null, "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/2511955/the-newest-amazon-fire-hd-8-tablet-is-back-down-to-its-best-ever-price.html", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 29, "page_rating_contents": 90, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 246, "source_url": "https://www.pcworld.com/feed", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "The newest Amazon Fire HD 8 tablet is on sale at its best-ever price", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-11-06T11:30:00+00:00", "description": "\n<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<body><section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>I always thought that buying a 4K webcam was only something that streamers and influencers should care about. I mean, how much better am I <em>really</em> going to look when I\u2019m on a Teams call with my editors, or on a Skype call with my mom? It seemed quite silly to think about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I\u2019ve been playing around with several webcam options to see what difference they actually make to everyday video calls and meetings \u2014 and as it turns out, there are some real positives with 4K webcams. There are some negatives, too. (And I don\u2019t just mean that suddenly everyone can see that pimple you didn\u2019t bother to cover up.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s what I\u2019ve learned about why 4K webcams can be worth buying (and why they might not be) depending on your needs and use cases.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><strong", "id": 1463565, "language": null, "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/2503386/are-4k-webcams-worth-it-pros-and-cons-explained.html", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 29, "page_rating_contents": 90, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 246, "source_url": "https://www.pcworld.com/feed", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Are 4K webcams worth it?

Whether it\u2019s a picture of the Pope sporting a puffy Balenciaga jacket or Trump getting tackled and arrested, these AI-generated images appear super realistic (as long as you\u2019re not looking too close), so it can be hard to separate fact from fiction. This is because AI doesn\u2019t really understand context in the cultural or historical sense. While some AI-generated images are harmless and do not spread misinformation, others, especially ones involving celebrities or politicians, can cause a great deal of damage and brain rot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Heck, I consider myself to be a relatively tech-savvy person and even I\u2019ve been fooled once or twice. We\u2019re already in an era where even political leaders use AI images in misleading or emotion-provoking ways, so it\u2019s good to be able to identify whether what you\u2019re loo", "id": 1463566, "language": null, "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/2505522/how-to-not-get-bamboozled-by-ai-content-on-the-web.html", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 29, "page_rating_contents": 90, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 246, "source_url": "https://www.pcworld.com/feed", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "How not to get bamboozled by AI content on the web", "vote": 0}]
