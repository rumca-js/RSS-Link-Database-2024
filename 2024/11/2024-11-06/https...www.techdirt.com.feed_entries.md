But now they’ve done it again, as the Fifth Circuit has pointed out that, no, RFK Jr. does not appear to have standing [&#8230;]

This is tentatively welcome news. I mean, it can&#8217;t result in anything worse than the original decision the Fourth Circuit handed down in the Chatrie case, which said there&#8217;s nothing constitutionally wrong with searching every Google user&#8217;s location info in hopes of finding the suspect law enforcement is actually looking for.
