Gamma radiation can convert methane into a wide variety of products at room temperature, including hydrocarbons, oxygen-containing molecules, and amino acids, reports a research team. This type of reaction probably plays an important role in the formation of complex organic molecules in the universe -- and possibly in the origin of life. They also open up new strategies for the industrial conversion of methane into high value-added products under mild conditions.

Exhaled breath contains chemical clues to what's going on inside the body, including diseases like lung cancer. And devising ways to sense these compounds could help doctors provide early diagnoses -- and improve patients' prospects. Researchers report developing ultrasensitive, nanoscale sensors that in small-scale tests distinguished a key change in the chemistry of the breath of people with lung cancer.

The cost of childbirth and postpartum health care results in significant, ongoing financial hardship, particularly for lower-income families with commercial insurance. About half of people who give birth in the United States are covered by commercial health insurance, which typically requires cost-sharing in the form of deductibles, copayments, and coinsurance.

## Bioengineers shed light on dosing challenges for cancer immunotherapy

A team of bioengineers has developed a mathematical model that clarifies why interleukin-12 (IL-12) -- a potent immune-boosting protein that holds promise for cancer treatment -- loses effectiveness over time when used as an immunotherapeutic. The research challenges long-held assumptions about IL-12 s behavior in the body and offers a path toward safer and more effective dosing regimens.

By scanning the brains of people while they watched movie clips, neuroscientists have created the most detailed functional map of the brain to date. The fMRI analysis shows how different brain networks light up when participants viewed short clips from a range of independent and Hollywood films including Inception, The Social Network, and Home Alone. The team identified different brain networks involved in processing scenes with people, inanimate objects, action, and dialogue. They also revealed how different executive networks are prioritized during easy- versus hard-to-follow scenes.

A new study changes the way we understand memory. Until now, memories have been explained by the activity of brain cells called neurons that respond to learning events and control memory recall. Neurologists have now expanded this theory by showing that non-neuronal cell types in the brain called astrocytes -- star-shaped cells -- also store memories and work in concert with groups of neurons called engrams to regulate storage and retrieval of memories.

## Imaging nuclear shapes by smashing them to smithereens

Scientists have demonstrated a new way to use high-energy particle smashups at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) to reveal subtle details about the shapes of atomic nuclei. The method is complementary to lower energy techniques for determining nuclear structure. It will add depth to scientists' understanding of the nuclei that make up the bulk of visible matter.

## The egg or the chicken? An ancient unicellular says egg

Chromosphaera perkinsii is a single-celled species discovered in 2017 in marine sediments around Hawaii. The first signs of its presence on Earth have been dated at over a billion years, well before the appearance of the first animals. A team has observed that this species forms multicellular structures that bear striking similarities to animal embryos. These observations suggest that the genetic programs responsible for embryonic development were already present before the emergence of animal life, or that C. perkinsii evolved independently to develop similar processes. Nature would therefore have possessed the genetic tools to 'create eggs' long before it 'invented chickens'.
