I will present a neat little trick how to leverage an ambiguity error into a non-conversion check.\n\nSponsored By think-cell\n---\n\nThe ACCU Conference is the annual conference of the ACCU membership, but is open to any and all who wish to attend. The tagline for the ACCU is 'Professionalism in Programming', which captures the whole spectrum of programming languages, tools, techniques and processes involved in advancing our craft. While there remains a core of C and C++ - with many members participating in respective ISO standards bodies - the conference, like the organisation, embraces other language ecosystems and you should expect to see sessions on C#, D, F#, Go, Javascript, Haskell, J", "id": 1464049, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VDqgQUUXc0", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 421, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCJhay24LTpO1s4bIZxuIqKw", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/1VDqgQUUXc0/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Lightning Talk: Checking Functor Arguments in C++ - Peter Hrenka - ACCU 2024", "vote": 0}]
