<p>In October, Microsoft unveiled a roadmap for next-generation AI experiences within Windows 11. Today, two of those — in Paint and Notepad — begin rolling out to testers.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2472069/windows-holiday-plans-include-ai-photo-upscaling-smart-file-search.html">Microsoft’s October AI roadmap</a> included tweaks to Paint, Notepad, and Search. Microsoft Recall was expected soon, too. <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2507827/windows-11s-controversial-ai-recall-feature-delayed-again.html">Recall, of course, has been delayed again</a> until December, as Microsoft works to ensure it’s secure and private.</p>



<p>For now, three new features are debuting in the Canary and Dev Channels within Windows 11: AI rewriting within Notepad, plus Generative Fill and Generative Erase within Microsoft Paint.</p>

<p>A new Windows Insider test build seeks to solve one of the more frustrating problems with Windows on Arm: when an application simply doesn’t work.</p>



<p>Build 27744 within the Microsoft Windows 11 Canary Channel contains a new version of Microsoft’s Prism emulator, with a key addition: Prism now supports legacy AVX as well as AVX2 instructions. “You may find some games or creative apps that were blocked due to CPU requirements before will be able to run using Prism on this build of Windows,” a <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2024/11/06/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-27744-canary-channel/">post</a> describing the new build explains. </p>



<p>This is a big deal. Microsoft Windows runs applications written for either x86 or Arm processors, though the version of Windows has to match up with the specific instruction set. B

<p>Antivirus software is a necessary tool in today’s online world. Attacks are only becoming more sophisticated, especially with aid of AI. Even the tech-savvy and cautious can drop their guard at wrong time or get tricked into exposing themselves to malware, spyware, or ransomware. Antivirus protection is an essential backup against such threats. </p>



<p>Most systems come with security software baked into the OS, but for some folks, an upgrade can help demystify and simplify online security. To help you choose a good suite, we’ve identified products that offer excellent protection, worthwhile features, and minimal performance impact on your PC.</p>



<p><strong>Why you should trust us:</strong> PCWorld has been deep in the trenches of testing computer hardware, software, and services since 1983—including security suites. For antivirus apps, we continual

<p>The Black Friday vibe settled in early this year because the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-2022-MacBook-Laptop-chip/dp/B0DLJ4JKHB">M2 MacBook Air with 16GB of RAM just dropped to $799</a>, a $200 discount from its MSRP and $400 off the price it was just a week ago before Apple updated it. This is easily the best price we’ve seen for this laptop.</p>



<p>The best part about this discount is that it makes the 16GB version of the laptop just $50 above <a href="https://www.amazon.com/2022-Apple-MacBook-Laptop-chip/dp/B0B3BVWJ6Y/">the model that sports half the RAM</a>, making the upgrade an easy pick as Apple charges $200 for the upgrade. Both models are otherwise identical down to the same 256GB storage capacity.</p>



<p>This is a laptop we loved testing, as our review concluded with a 4.5-star rating and our Editors’ Choice award. Our expert, Ja

<p>Less than a month ago, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2494185/chatgpt-desktop-app-finally-comes-to-windows-with-features-missing.html">OpenAI released its Windows app for ChatGPT</a>, allowing you to use the AI chatbot on a desktop PC without running it in a browser tab. But it was an “early version” reserved for paid subscribers, so many users were left out in the cold.</p>



<p>Fortunately, there <em>is</em> a way to use ChatGPT on Windows without paying for a premium plan — if you get the nightly version of Windows Terminal.</p>



<p>Windows Terminal is a free app provided by Microsoft that’s basically a faster, more modern, more powerful, and more efficient alternative to Command Prompt but still more accessible and easier to use than the built-for-power-users PowerShell.</p>

That’s a hefty $300 discount, bringing this RTX 4070-equipped laptop down in line with those that only have RTX 4060s. It’s a solid option for gamers and professionals who need power.</p>



<p>Under the hood, this MSI Katana configuration features an AMD Ryzen 9 8945HS processor alongside 16GB of DDR5 RAM. That’s more than enough power and memory to handle most of what you could throw at it, and you can later upgrade it up to 64GB of RAM when needed.</p>

<p>I block every single ad on YouTube. And I’m a hypocrite for doing it. But I’m not ashamed. Because through a series of blunders and malicious decisions, Google has systematically made YouTube a worse and worse viewing experience, abusing its monopoly position as the de facto home of video on the web. </p>

<p>When you install Windows 11, you’re asked to log in with a Microsoft account (or create one if you don’t have one). Maybe you don’t like this. Maybe you miss the days when you could use Windows on a PC with a local account and not have to worry about being tied online.</p>



<p>Well, you wouldn’t be the only one, which is why there have always been tricks and tools to circumvent the Microsoft account requirement — <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2354686/microsoft-blocks-windows-11-workaround-local-accounts.html">even as Microsoft repeatedly blocks those methods</a>.</p>



<p>Recently, a new trick has surfaced: you can now use a PowerShell script called <strong>UnattendedWinstall</strong> to access Windows 11 without having to log in with a Microsoft account. Not only does it get around the restriction, but it can also do a few other things, too

<p>The Windows search function is very practical because it usually finds installed programs faster than using the program menu. However, you can also use the input field to search the internet. By default, Windows uses the Microsoft search engine <a href="https://www.bing.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bing</a> for this. Unfortunately, the results often cannot keep up with those of Google. With the <a href="https://github.com/rcmaehl/MSEdgeRedirect" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MS Edge Redirect</a> tool, you can redirect the search from Bing to Google. We’ll show you how to do it.</p>

<p>Sometimes it’s worth splurging on something like an expensive iPad. Other times you just need a practical and affordable device that gets stuff done and serves you well, one that you don’t have to worry about, one that you can happily pass over to the kids as needed.</p>



<p>That’s what the Amazon Fire HD 8 tablet is all about, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fire-HD-8-Tablet-Black-32GB/dp/B0CVDN4QS6/">right now it’s on sale for just $55</a> — that’s a whopping 45 percent off its original price of $100, making it one of the best-value tablet buys this year.</p>



<p>This 8-inch tablet is small enough to stash into your bag wherever you go, but still large enough for comfortable video streaming, web browsing, tablet gaming, and setting aside as an always-on display. With up to 13 hours of battery life, it’s great for all-day entertainment.</p>

<p>I always thought that buying a 4K webcam was only something that streamers and influencers should care about. I mean, how much better am I <em>really</em> going to look when I’m on a Teams call with my editors, or on a Skype call with my mom? It seemed quite silly to think about.</p>



<p>But I’ve been playing around with several webcam options to see what difference they actually make to everyday video calls and meetings — and as it turns out, there are some real positives with 4K webcams. There are some negatives, too. (And I don’t just mean that suddenly everyone can see that pimple you didn’t bother to cover up.)</p>



<p>Here’s what I’ve learned about why 4K webcams can be worth buying (and why they might not be) depending on your needs and use cases.</p>

<p>Nowadays, it’s easy to get fooled by AI content on the web. Whether it’s a picture of the Pope sporting a puffy Balenciaga jacket or Trump getting tackled and arrested, these AI-generated images appear super realistic (as long as you’re not looking too close), so it can be hard to separate fact from fiction. This is because AI doesn’t really understand context in the cultural or historical sense. While some AI-generated images are harmless and do not spread misinformation, others, especially ones involving celebrities or politicians, can cause a great deal of damage and brain rot.</p>



<p>Heck, I consider myself to be a relatively tech-savvy person and even I’ve been fooled once or twice. We’re already in an era where even political leaders use AI images in misleading or emotion-provoking ways, so it’s good to be able to identify whether what you’re loo
