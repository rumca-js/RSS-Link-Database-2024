<p>The <a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/" data-type="link" data-id="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mozilla Foundation</a>, the nonprofit organization behind the Firefox open-source browser, said it has laid off about 30% of its employees as part of a reorganization to increase its “agility.”</p>



<p>As of 2023, the foundation had <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/200097189" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">between 80</a> and 300 employees, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Foundation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to varying reports</a>.

<p>Let’s face it: For many people, web browser performance could well be more important than general PC performance.</p>



<p>Browser makers are wising up to this, too. Google Chrome just introduced <a href="https://blog.google/products/chrome/google-chrome-performance-controls-october-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new performance controls</a>, while Microsoft Edge has attempted to stand out with its own <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/learn-about-performance-features-in-microsoft-edge-7b36f363-2119-448a-8de6-375cfd88ab25" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">browser performance options</a>. And every web browser out there has long fought over the title

<p>Zooming out, will Donald Trump’s victory in the US presidential race give Apple more bargaining power when negotiating with European regulators — and to what extent will the ongoing US anti-trust investigation of the company (<a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2073782/experts-see-no-merit-to-doj-antitrust-fight-with-apple.html">shaky as it is</a>) gain presidential support? </p>



<p>Those could be the kind of questions Apple CEO Tim Cook is asking himself this morning as the former President inches toward a new administration in 2025. We can surmise this based on what Trump said during the campaign, when he explained <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/10/18/donald-trump-tim-cook-st

<p>Sometimes a Windows installation simply goes off the rails. Menus don’t open properly, icons start moving around the desktop, File Explorer acts up, apps get weird, and so forth. Enough things can go wrong, or turn strange, that it’s important to understand various basic Windows repair strategies.</p>



<p>Over the past decade, one of the chief techniques in my own repair arsenal for Windows 10 and 11 has been what’s sometimes called an “in-place upgrade install” or an “upgrade repair install.” (Spoiler alert! This is absurdly easy to do in Windows 11 version 23H2 and later.)</p>



<p>Before going into the details of how to perform such a maneuver, let’s start with a definition and some expla

<p>At this point, I think it’s safe to say the current wave of “AI everything” isn’t all it’s cracked up to be.</p>



<p>Let’s not sugarcoat it: The vast majority of generative-AI gobbledegook is unreliable, impractical, and more about marketing than any manner of real-world benefit for us — the (alleged) humans meant to be benefiting from it. But here and there amidst all the overhyped hullaballoo, a genuinely useful possibility pops up and peeks its way through the metaphorical curtain.</p>



<p>For some folks, that’s absolutely been the case with the AI-powered summarizing options appearing in apps and services across the tech universe these days. One click, tap, or spoken request — and boom:
