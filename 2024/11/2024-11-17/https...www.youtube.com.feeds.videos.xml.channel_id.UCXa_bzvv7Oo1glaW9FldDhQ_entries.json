The sheer number of machines, improved visuals and attention to detail, more crops, new farmsteads - what more could you want?\n\nAnd make no mistake - this is the gameplay loop that fans love, from cultivating, ploughing, seeding, and harvesting to slowly discovering different types of crops, taking on contracts, and expanding your business.
