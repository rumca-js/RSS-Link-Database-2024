My brother is a teenager and is constantly leaving the house and worrying my mother by not telling her where he is. This is NOT for malicious purposes. I use Kali since a year or two ago on and off; I know his number, appleid and IMEI num (I could also get the MAC add) but have yet to find an app or build one to locate him.
