## VLC and MMAL on Raspberry Pi 3A+

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi there, been working on a project that&#39;s a simple video player using a DSI screen. I&#39;m running Bookworm 32bit desktop, and VLC works smoothly using the MMAL x11 splitter output method. However, I need the Pi to boot faster and load the video right away, so I&#39;ve been trying to get VLC working from the command line in hopes to use it with LITE. I discovered quickly that its not possible to do this anymore because current versions of VLC included with Bookworm is missing the standalone MMAL module needed to render video without X11 (apparently because it doesn&#39;t work with 64 bit versions and the Pi5). I tried buster and it boots into the desktop way faster, but playback in VLC had a lot of screen tearing, even when using MMAL and trying to allocate more video memory. I suspect it had something to do with my display.</p> <p>Does anyone have any ideas to what I should do?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https:/

## Anyone have a solution widely available to power pi5 with full 5v5a capability off a DC/DC Converter?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m trying to find a simple solution to integrating my pi5 to my robot. I really want it to have full, stable power capabilities without having to jerry-rig multiple boards to do it.</p> <p>The robot runs off a 24v battery system and has a 5v10a regulated supply as well. Between these two it should be sufficient.</p> <p>However i can&#39;t seem to find a stable workaround to the usbc/pd/pps outside of the &quot;USB-PD 2.0/3.0 to 5V 5A Converter for RaspberryPi 5&quot; by Pichondria. It is listed on tindie but for $30 and ships from India.</p> <p>I hope that there is a more widely available board that can do this outside of the Pichondria board.</p> <p>manipulating the config.txt file looks like it could lead to potential issues which is not an option.<br/> The PoE hat is not an option.</p> <p>This is the last pi i will ever buy, they really screwed up with the usb pd fancy requirements and attempt at vendor lock-in.</p> <p>edit: I am based in aus
