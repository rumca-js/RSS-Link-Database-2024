They’re both single ports that I believe are 3.5. I randomly found an RCA (yellow and white) to 3.5 cable, again at Goodwill, and figured I’d try it out. To my surprise, it works perfectly lol. So now it’s a great little mobile DVD/gaming setup. Just thought you guys might appreciate it. Ps. The blue glow in the pic isn’t there in person. It actually has solid contrast/blacks. Pss. Anyone else have a weird/unique gaming setup? Now I’m curious about what’s possible. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/joshisnot12"> 

## Me and my 2 friends are looking for multiplayer PC games where we progress towards goals together, but also can progress on our own too whenever we want.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So basically like how in MMORPGs....how you&#39;re obviously working towards goals together often times. But you can also work towards goals on your own too whenever you want as well. Sadly I don&#39;t think any of us have time for an MMORPG cuz we all work full time and are busy with other stuff. But literally any other genre is perfectly fine to suggest. I think something with like RPG elements would be best though. Like something to where we&#39;re still going on adventures leveling stuff up and collecting cool items. But any all genres besides MMORPGs are welcomed in this discussion : )</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/pcgamingtilidie"> /u/pcgamingtilidie </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1gt5ho6/me_and_my_2_friends_are_looking_for_multiplayer/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1gt5ho6/me_and_my_2_friends_are_looki

## if you could turn any modern movie (last ten years) into a game adaptation, what would you choose?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am a huge fan of movie game adaptions (specifically the gamecube era ones which were usually really fun [over the hedge, madagascar, cars, etc.]). what would you adapt (assuming it’s done well obviously) </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/koopingntrooping"> /u/koopingntrooping </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1gt4dxa/if_you_could_turn_any_modern_movie_last_ten_years/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1gt4dxa/if_you_could_turn_any_modern_movie_last_ten_years/">[comments]</a></span>
