However something piqued my interest recently and I found out that I tend to understand it fairly easily when I see tutorials. But the only thing holding me back is the fact that I see so many people like computer geeks and technology geniuses all starting around 12 years old on average. Is it possible for me to learn some languages and potentially land a job in eg.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’ve been working on my hobby project inspired by kernel modules. The idea is: write some raw C code, upload it to a server, and it compiles and runs it at runtime. No precompilation, no restarts. :D</p> <p>C isn’t usually the go-to for web dev (for good reasons), but here’s how I’ve tried to make it less painful:</p> <p>• ⁠Slow Build Cycles: Upload code, and the server handles the rest—like &quot;hot reloading,&quot; but in C. • ⁠Speed vs. Practicality: Great for scenarios where performance actually matters, like data-heavy or real-time stuff. • ⁠Memory Management: Modules are isolated, so crashes don’t take everything down. • ⁠Built-In Libraries: Comes with SQLite3, OpenSSL, and Jansson support to save you from reinventing the wheel.</p> <p>It’s just a proof of concept, not production-ready (please don’t deploy it), but it’s fun to work on! Would love any feedback on it. It allows for some interesting possibilities, like being able to update WebSoc

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone,</p> <p>Two weeks ago, I had never written a single line of JavaScript. My background was far from web development, but I decided to take on the challenge of learning Next.js and building something useful. I started from the very basics, literally writing my first &quot;Hello World&quot; in JavaScript, and in just 14 days, I developed a full-fledged tool!</p> <p>I wanted to create something that could help others, so I focused on building a search tool that helps you find real conversations across platforms like Reddit, Twitter, and Quora—perfect for finding your first users, validating your product ideas, or doing quick market research.</p> <p>The journey was intense—learning React, understanding Next.js’s server-side rendering, and figuring out how to scrape and analyze data. But it was super rewarding seeing everything come together </p> <p>Let me know what you think!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://

Seems like an amazing opportunity for programmers to earn some money while doing stand-alone tasks. Each offered task mentions how much it&#39;ll pay you (in crypto currency). I&#39;ll just copy/paste from their website: &#39;Bepro is a task-based marketplace created to help organizations and builders thrive.
