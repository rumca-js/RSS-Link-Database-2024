<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello there. I have kinda weird situation. I have to get my Epic Games Account back and i know my switch is connected to this account. I can log in with my switch in this account.</p> <p>Now i wanted to see the requests of my switch with a proxy. And i see the requests. But the problem is that it is obviously encrypted.</p> <p>I used charlesproxy, but i can‘t install any certificate on my switch. Is there any method to decrypt these requests? </p> <p>Greetings! And thank you.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/lefduti"> /u/lefduti </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking_Tutorials/comments/1gtav47/decrypt_nintendo_switch_requests/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking_Tutorials/comments/1gtav47/decrypt_nintendo_switch_requests/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey guys, </p> <p>Trying to learn more about cyber security, pen testing and cs standards such as iso 27001 (but that boring part is just for work). </p> <p>How would you start getting into the „real hands on hacking“? I’ve learned some stuff about security in theory, but I’d like to actually try it from a „dark side hacker perspective“ to learn the real penetration possibilities and be more prepared to repel such attacks. </p> <p>Thanks! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Crazy-General-1031"> /u/Crazy-General-1031 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking_Tutorials/comments/1gt0vvp/introduction_into_hacking/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking_Tutorials/comments/1gt0vvp/introduction_into_hacking/">[comments]</a></span>
