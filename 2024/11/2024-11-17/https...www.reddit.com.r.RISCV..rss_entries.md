## How much do you save with RISC-V?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am just curious, I have no technical knowledge. What I read is that RISC-V is exciting but not yet ready for prime time because many games won&#39;t run on it yet without an emulator like Box86 or WINE.</p> <p>Nonetheless, I am sure it will be ready soon, so just wondering that when it becomes available to the mainstream, just how much are we going to save? I know that the main reason for RISC-V is that it is open-source so you don&#39;t have to pay Microsoft and Intel/AMD/nVidia for any of their chipsets, but you surely still have to pay for the base materials since nothing is 100% free, and of course RISC-V being energy efficient probably saves a lot on energy costs as well. So for a typical home user, are we talking about 20%, 30%, 50%... etc... saving? Also, will RISC-V also give more performance at the same price point?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/LosAngelestoNSW"> /u/LosAngelestoNSW <

## blind and looking for some remote help setting up my StarFive Vision Five 2

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This is a real long-shot. I bought a StarFive Vision Five 2 board recently. I&#39;m blind and could use some help with setup, mainly direction in where to plug the TTL to USB cable and how to set the dip switches for booting. I&#39;ve literally never done this kind of thing, so I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s the kind of thing that somebody could guide me to do remotely. But assuming it is, is anyone interested?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/space_age_communist"> /u/space_age_communist </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1gtheuz/blind_and_looking_for_some_remote_help_setting_up/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1gtheuz/blind_and_looking_for_some_remote_help_setting_up/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>It looks like the DuckDB team is considering RISC-V support.</p> <p>As we were able to show them that we build DuckDB on RISC-V, they now want to add it to their Docker image.</p> <p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/carlopi.bsky.social/post/3lb5gftgcbs2m">https://bsky.app/profile/carlopi.bsky.social/post/3lb5gftgcbs2m</a></p> <p>&quot;Would you be interested in submitting a PR to add this to the docker tests for <a href="https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb">github.com/duckdb/duckdb</a> ? Those are in <a href="https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/blob/main/.github/workflows/DockerTests.yml">https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/blob/main/.github/workflows/DockerTests.yml</a>, and if you could add a line / check it actually works end to end that works also as documentation of what are the dependencies.&quot;</p> <p>I have never worked with Docker, but I&#39;m willing to assist anyone that does know more about Docker.</p> <p>This was the line to start the build.</
