This new testing compares the i9-12900K, i7-12700K, i5-12600K, i5-12400, and i3-12100F against the best CPUs for 2024, including the AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D, 7800X3D, and more. Benchmarks also include the 12900K vs. 14900K (for possible in-socket upgrades), the 12700K vs. 13700K and 14700K, and plenty of other tests. The Alder Lake series managed to dodge Intel's 13th & 14th Gen instability issues, where processor stability posed problematic prior to microcode updates (and those affected would remain affected). While we wouldn't necessarily recommend an Intel 12 series CPU these days, they have gotten cheap enough that there are times they make sense. But generally, this video is made for people on those CPUs who may want to figure out the best upgrade path.
