<ul><li>Kane penalty sparks rout after Scales shown red card</li><li>Gordon, Gallagher, Bowen and Harwood-Bellis on target</li></ul><p>It was an England salvo of devastating power, three goals in five minutes early in the second half and it did more than reframe an occasion that had been flat and forgettable up until then. It gave Lee Carsley the win that he wanted on his sixth and final game as the interim manager; one to seal England’s promotion back into the Nations League’s A section. With five wins and just that one off-night against Greece at Wembley, it added up to job well done.</p><p>Carsley will hand over to Thomas Tuchel with the team in good health, a new generation also pushed. Carsley had previously given first caps to Angel Gomes, Morgan Gibbs-White, Noni Madueke. Curtis Jones, Lewis Hall and Morgan Rogers. Here, there were two more debuts – for Tino Livramento from the outset and Taylor Harwood-Bellis as a substitute.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/

<ul><li>Updates from St Lucia; match starts at 8pm GMT</li><li>Live scorecard will appear here | <a href="mailto:Tim.DeLisle@theguardian.com">Email Tim</a></li></ul><p>Evening everyone and welcome to the fifth act of another sporting drama. Some might say it was a dead rubber, but they would be missing the point. In a sport that loves its records the way cricket does, rubbers never die. Any of the 22 players could post a career-best tonight, score a hundred, grab a four-for or do something that hasn’t been done before in nearly 20 years of T20 internationals.</p><p>And, as we saw last night, the competitive juices will still flow. England could go home glowing with satisfaction after a resounding 4-1 win, or lose again and leave West Indies on a roll. It’s not <em>all</em> to play for, but there’s still enough: pride, a place in the team, and of course entertainment – the chance to fire up new fans or put a smile on the faces of the older ones.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.co

Among his many discoveries was the local custom of picnicking in cemeteries. “Romanians eat with their dead,” Spoerri remarked in a 2015 biopic, gazing at a photograph he had brought back from his visit of a dining table next to a grave.</p><p>The image might have been of one of his own works. In 1983, Spoerri had organised an al fresco dinner for 120 guests in a town outside Paris. As they ate, a nearby crane dug a trench the same size as the dining table. Halfway through the meal, diners were asked to remove their place settings – plates, glass and cutlery – and lower them into the 40-metre ditch, which was then filled in with earth. The performance was called <a href="https://www.dejeunersouslherbe.org/">Le Déjeuner sous l’Herb

<p>Deluxe, restaurant-quality sandwiches have become a national obsession. Here’s why tuna mayo will never be the same again</p><p>It’s a weekday lunchtime and about 30&nbsp;people, mostly millennials in fashionable hiking trainers, are milling around in an alleyway off London’s Hackney Road. The scent of a wood-fired oven wafts in as everyone waits for the sandwich they preordered the night before; a maximum of 200 will be sold. Rogue Sarnies isn’t the only sandwich place taking preorders these days. Eric’s and Chatsworth Bakehouse, both in London, and Fat Pat’s in Manchester do it too. It speaks to the prudence of the operators – wasting as little as possible – and confirms the sandwich as a status symbol, something to post&nbsp;about for clout, replacing burgers and joining baked goods as items to display in foodies’ social media feeds.</p><p>Sahil Patel and two friends, who live nearby, have been to Rogue Sarnies every Thursday for a month, working their way through the menu. “We

<p>James Norton, Thomasin McKenzie and Bill Nighy star in a solid study of the trio behind the first test-tube baby</p><p>It’s a scientific breakthrough that touched the lives of hundreds of thousands of individuals; a technique that gave fresh hope to innumerable childless couples. But as this solid, workmanlike drama reveals, the development of IVF was fraught with controversy. The core team of visionary scientist Robert Edwards (James Norton), surgeon Patrick Steptoe (Bill Nighy) and laboratory manager and gifted embryologist Jean Purdy (Thomasin McKenzie) had to contend with intense media scrutiny, bitter ethical debates and accusations of “playing God”.</p><p>Written by Jack Thorne and directed by Ben Taylor (<em>Sex Education</em>), <em>Joy</em> explores the considerable personal cost to Purdy in particular; devoutly religious, she found herself estranged from her mother and rejected by her church. It’s an atmospherically dour period piece that captures the dispiriting colour p

<p>Family wealth dictates our life choices. So is the Bank of Mum and Dad now behind so many of society’s growing inequalities?</p><p>You know the Bank of Mum and Dad when you see it: it’s your friend who seems broke, but always has a safety net, or who suddenly (but discreetly) acquires the deposit for a home. It’s those who stayed with their parents while they saved for a flat, or stuck it out in a profession they were passionate about even though the wages are chronically low. It’s those who do not need to consider the financial costs of having children. It’s those whose grandparents are covering nursery or university fees, with the Bank of Grandma and Grandad already driving an economic wedge between different cohorts in generations Alpha (born between 2010 and 2024) and Z (born in the late 1990s and early 2000s).</p><p>This is the picture we know, but the Bank of Mum and Dad is not just a luxury confined to the 1% – it is also evident in families like mine.

<p>A 20-metre fall while mountaineering left the academic and philosopher with life-changing injuries. In this extract from his diary, his clear-eyed willingness to confront his situation leads to some breathtakingly honest reflections</p><p>Paul Sagar, 37, is reader in political theory in the department of political economy at King’s College London. He studied at the universities of Cambridge, Oxford and London and in 2020 received the British and Irish Association for Political Thought early career award for excellence in research and teaching. A once passionate rock climber, he suffered a catastrophic accident last year while climbing in Scotland. The accident left him tetraplegic, paralysed from the collarbones down, with only residual use of his hands. After eight months in hospital, he resumed academic work in early 2024, continuing physical rehabilitation and attempting to adjust to life with severe disability.

<p>Piles of loo paper, a years worth of tinned good and snake-proof boots. No wonder prepping has become a lifestyle choice </p><p>Prepping – I’m coming round to it. I’ve had Prepare, the old government website that Oliver Dowden launched this spring, open on my laptop in a quivering tab for a while now, and this week I’ve been dipping in every now and then to remind myself of “how to prepare for an emergency”. How many bottles of water we may need, tweezers, a sage reminder about the fact of tinned meat.</p><p>I’ve dabbled in prepping before, without really realising what I was doing. A fear in the early 2000s that Rimmel might stop making my favourite eyeliner led to me dashing to Boots to buy five. Which is fairly normal, I think? On the spectrum of normal?
