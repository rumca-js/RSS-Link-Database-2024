We both realised that maybe board games is a little bit more than just monopoly. we thought that the game everdell had very beautiful art and looked cool so we bought it and played it. It was very fun. it was a little bit complicated to get going as we have no experience to board games except for the classic &quot;family games&quot;, but it was worth the struggle at the begining.</p> <p>(QUESTION)</p> <p>We liked everdell very much but we would also like to play a game were some fighting is involved like against monsters etc. however we want a game that we can learn in 1 day.
