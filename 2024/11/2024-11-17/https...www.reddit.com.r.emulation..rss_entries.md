<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi,</p> <p>I recenty got back into N64 emulation, and of course discovered ParaLLEl RDP (via RMG and Simple64). It&#39;s working great for me, except for one thing: deinterlacing. It does bob or weave, and both look absolutely horrible to me. A choice between combing with moving, or flickering with static images.</p> <p>Is this just what it is, or am I missing something? How do you guys deal with it, and is there perhaps a fix or workaround to mitigate the effects?</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/sndwv001"> /u/sndwv001 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emulation/comments/1gth2lr/n64_parallel_and_deinterlacing/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emulation/comments/1gth2lr/n64_parallel_and_deinterlacing/">[comments]</a></span>
