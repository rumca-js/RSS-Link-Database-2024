She tells the story of a Navy officer who, after being dismissed from Admiral Rickover's Nuclear Navy, devised a plan to gather intelligence by tapping into Soviet underwater communication cables. Inspired by childhood memories of riverboat rides and signs marking cable crossings, he convinced the U.S. government to send a submarine into a remote Soviet sea to locate and tap these cables. This daring mission successfully intercepted Soviet communications, providing valuable intelligence that contributed to the easing of Cold War tensions. Sherry Sontag encourages the audience to explore further details in her book and a related documentary.\n\nSponsored By thin", "id": 1530067, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MXmn0XYhlE", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 421, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCJhay24LTpO1s4bIZxuIqKw", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/4MXmn0XYhlE/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Lightning Talk: Submarine Spying - Sherry Sontag - ACCU 2024", "vote": 0}]
