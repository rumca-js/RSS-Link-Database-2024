Fitgirl, DODI, RUNE...you name it, I downloaded 4 versions.</p> <p>I pasted the mod onto all of their folders and always this same error shows up. </p> <p>I&#39;ve noticed that HOI4 torrents that are in rar file and you just extract them to play them instead of installing them, doesn&#39;t have this problem.</p> <p>Can you help me or show me where I could go?</p> <p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/eq74akd9sd1e1.p
