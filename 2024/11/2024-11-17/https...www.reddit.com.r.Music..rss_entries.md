## Is there a name for the bright exposure transition effect that was popular in music videos in the mid-to-late 90s?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m specifically referring to the one where they ramp up the exposure really fast, do a cut, and then lower the exposure. That&#39;s the best way I can describe it. It was used a lot in alternative rock videos, notably <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6P0SitRwy8">Heart Shaped Box</a> by Nirvana from 1993 because they used it like two dozen times in the video. </p> <p>Just wondering if anyone has any information on how this became popular, who used it, and why it ended up going away. But it seems like a staple of the aesthetic style of the late 90s music videos (along with the wide-angle lens!).</p> <p>Here are some others where it&#39;s used frequently:</p> <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpdcKmaHk_s">When the Lights Go Out</a> by Five </p> <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwtdhWltSIg">Losing My Religion</a> by REM</p> <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsJ4O-nSveg">Lightning Crashes</a> by Live</p> <p><a

It encapsulates the whole mood of the song and album for me. As far as iconic 4 notes go, I doubt any thing can beat that.</p> <ol> <li><p>Everything in its right place(Radiohead)- The 4 notes at the start are like an introduction to a different era, like a dystopian future, like an introduction to the 21st century.</p></li> <li><p>And I love her (The Beatles): One of the more beautiful ones, it&#39;s just to mesmerizing.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m trying to compile a list of songs we can use to try and reference in our minds to remember specific notes. We can combine this with relative pitch for a less than reliable &quot;pseudo perfect pitch.&quot;The best real life example I have is that my student that can reliably conjur up a G because the My Chemical Romance song &quot;Welcome to the Black Parade&quot; starts with a single G5 on the piano. It seems like the more emotions and memories associated with the song the better. Bonus points if the note is singable for most people, the low E on a guitar is common but difficult to sing. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/koalanights"> /u/koalanights </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1gtetww/iconic_songs_that_start_with_a_single_note/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1gtetww/iconic_songs_that_start_with_a_single
