<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I want to find API calls made on a <a href="https://www.cardekho.com/overview/Tata_Safari/Tata_Safari_Smart.htm">website</a> but the API calls are not visible in &#39;Network&#39; tab. That&#39;s usually where I am able to find endpoints, but not for this one. I tried going through the JS files but couldn&#39;t find anything. Is there any other way to see API calls? Can someone help me figure out? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/VeganCannibal-"> /u/VeganCannibal- </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1gtciuq/how_to_find_hidden_api_that_is_not_visible_in/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1gtciuq/how_to_find_hidden_api_that_is_not_visible_in/">[comments]</a></span>
