<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello! My brother is a teenager and is constantly leaving the house and worrying my mother by not telling her where he is. This is NOT for malicious purposes. I use Kali since a year or two ago on and off; I know his number, appleid and IMEI num (I could also get the MAC add) but have yet to find an app or build one to locate him. Any help would be appreciated, just guide me, this is NOT A REQUEST.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SillyAdministration9"> /u/SillyAdministration9 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hackers/comments/1gtdayq/a_little_help_with_tracking_my_brother_for_safety/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hackers/comments/1gtdayq/a_little_help_with_tracking_my_brother_for_safety/">[comments]</a></span>

## Lets create a pen-testing cooperative, we do all the work, automating the management and administrative jobs is trivial. I have made up to 150,000 USD on a single bug bounty, but if I was pooling my rewards with others, and we had no c-suite overhead we could poach everyone and shut down competition
