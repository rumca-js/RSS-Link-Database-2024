Now you can listen to Congolese or Kazakh news every morning with minimal effort! (assuming you can find the right RSS feeds)</p> <p>It uses Llama as the LLM and Coqui for TTS, so everything runs locally. Just make sure you have a decent GPU on your machine. Alternatively, you can try it here: <a href=\"http://news.ashkan.zone\">http://news.ashkan.zone</a></p> <p>Currently the audio can be in English, Spanish, or French.</p> <p>Any feedback would be appreciated! :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/AshkanArabim\"> /u/AshkanArabim", "id": 1532602, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1gtp2xi/i_created_an_app_to_get_news_from_foreign_rss", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 482, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "I created an app to get news from foreign RSS feeds translated, summarized, and spoken to you daily!", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-11-17T19:51:54+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p><a href=\"https://freshrss.org/index.html\">Freshrss</a> <a href=\"https://reederapp.com/\">Reeder</a></p> <p>Basically the title.
