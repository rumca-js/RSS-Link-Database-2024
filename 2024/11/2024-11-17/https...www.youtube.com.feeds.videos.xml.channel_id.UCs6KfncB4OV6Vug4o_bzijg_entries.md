Privacy costs money....or so you thought! Today I cover how to achieve reasonable levels of privacy on a budget with budget-friendly privacy tools. I dive into password managers, search engines, messengers, operating systems and so much more with three budgets: $13/month, $5/month, and $0/month. Enjoy, and I hope this gives ideas to maximize your privacy & security!
