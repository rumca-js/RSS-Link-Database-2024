However, I am starting to wonder what the real difference is between the professional figure of the web developer and that of the mobile app developer. Is it possible that both figures are the same thing? Is the background training the same or different? Why does it seem that there is more demand for professional figures from web developers in this historical period? Thank you very much in advance for all your clarifications\ud83d\ude09</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ManuelC89\"> /u/ManuelC89 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1gtc3lu/web_developer_or_mobile_app_developer/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1gtc3lu/web_developer_or_mob", "id": 1529814, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1gtc3lu/web_developer_or_mobile_app_developer", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 508, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Web Developer or Mobile App Developer", "vote": 0}]
