Great game.</p> <p>Metal Gear Solid 2 I\u2019m a bit mixed on. On the gameplay side of things it\u2019s basically the first game but better with way more stealth options. I found the amount of timer sequences a bit annoying and the backtracking got pretty repetitive but other than that it was great.
