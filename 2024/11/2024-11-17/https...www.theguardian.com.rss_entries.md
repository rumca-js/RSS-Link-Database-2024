<p>England want to win the World Cup in two years’ time. They will not with a centre-forward who can no longer move </p><p>There was an oddly heartbreaking moment with 87 minutes gone at Wembley, as Harry Kane was put through on goal with a chance to score his second of the night, made all the more tender by the fact he seemed so desperately keen to do exactly that with England already 5-0 up.</p><p>Mainly it was heartbreaking because of the way Kane reached down to pump the accelerator, and just found nothing, a man suddenly running backwards through time, wind chimes tinkling. The finish was rushed and too close to the goalkeeper. Kane ended up flat on his face. He didn’t stop, passing and pointing and leading this team of tyros to the final whistle. Maybe he can wear his Bobby Charlton top next time and still take all the penalties.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/17/kane-has-been-the-defining-player-of-a-successful-era-but-that-has-run-its-course">Conti

True, he has lost plenty of class players to retirement, injury or overseas contracts. But he is being well remu

I want them to speak architecture.” So he has written <em><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/a-short-history-of-british-architecture-9780241674956/">A Short History of British Architecture</a></em>, which he hopes will help people understand what he calls the “language” of styles – such things as the difference between Doric and Corinthian columns, or between <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/sep/10/gothic-architecture-british">early English and perpendicular gothic</a>.</p><p>It turns out to be two books in one.

<p>As the ex-president returns, the masterly comedy about local government can feel like a fantasy. But its message is more relevant than ever</p><p>It’s been nearly a decade, and three presidential administrations, since Parks and Recreation aired its final season. In that time, the sunny comedy about local government has become a modern classic. It’s also become a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Capsule_(Parks_and_Recreation)">time capsule</a> for a certain Obama-era mindset: its relentlessly upbeat protagonist, Amy Poehler’s Leslie Knope, wholeheartedly believes in government’s power to make people’s lives better. In 2009, its optimism was contagious.</p><p>The show concluded in 2015 after seven delightful seasons. In the intervening years, many observers – including the show’s <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/obsessed/mike-schur-parks-and-rec-would-seem-naive-post-trump/">co-creator, Michael Schur</a> – have described Parks and Recreation as the product of a dif

<p>Francesca Scorsese and Sawyer Spielberg could be the draw in this tedium-rich tale of an Italian American festive gathering</p><p>The prosaic anti-escapism of this sprawling American indie thoroughly subverts the expectations of the festive family movie. <em>Christmas Eve </em><em>in Miller’s Point</em> is a mosaic portrait of an extended Italian American family gathered for their traditional seasonal celebration in Long Island. This may be the last year they do so: the suburban home of the ailing family matriarch is to be sold. Food is consumed, booze is swigged and the uncles bicker.</p><p>Director Tyler Taormina (<em>Ham on Rye</em>) strings together a picture that seems to be 80% composed of establishing shots of tinsel and festive tat, punctuated by micro non-events and meandering conversations. It’s almost radical in its banality, capturing rather effectively the overstuffed inertia of a family Christmas and the simmering generational tensions. But Taormina’s all vibes, no s

<p>The crossbench peer grew up in care and went on to become an actor, an academic and one of the first black women in the House of Lords. Now she has written a memoir documenting her remarkable story</p><p>In March 2012, Lola Young, who sits as a crossbench peer in the House of Lords, clambered on to the rush-hour bus that would take her from the children’s social care office in Islington, north London, to her home. In her arms was a box: a collection of papers she was so anxious to open she did it there on the bottom deck of the number 38, spreading the pages precariously across her lap. Names, dates, brief notes about prams and the application of olive oil to infant skin…</p><p>As the bus wove and lurched, Young read the story of the beginning of her life, and already there was so much to take in.

<p>Baking vibrant vegetables will add colour to darker days</p><p>The garden has turned a buttery yellow, the leaves of the fig and medlar, pear and plum, are mostly fallen now. Sweeping them up is a daily job involving a road-sweeper sized broom. A pleasure, actually. Before I pick up the brush, I put a tray of vegetables in the oven – scarlet peppers and fat courgettes, onions in thick segments and maybe an aubergine or two. They will roast, with olive oil, thyme leaves and cumin seeds, until soft and giving, their juices forming an impromptu dressing.</p><p>Sometimes, I will add golden raisins or pine kernels, toasted crumbs and crisped garlic or perhaps a trickle of balsamic vinegar or pomegranate molasses. As the days cool, I will introduce a little warmth in the form of harissa paste or smoked paprika, or add garlic, roasted and mashed to a paste and stirred into the juices.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/nov/17/nigel-slaters-recipes-for-baked-swede-and-pota

<p><strong>53two, Manchester</strong><br>In a lively revival of this 2009 tussle between love and identity, its barbed verbal sparring overcomes the slightly dated sexual dynamics</p><p>How charged and potent words can be. And how they can mislead. The title of British playwright Mike Bartlett’s 2009 play is principally a reference to the cockfights he saw in Mexico. But this bait-and-switch is merely the starting gun of a play about the slipperiness of language and labels: gay, straight, boyfriend, brother. Their elasticity is strained and snapped.</p><p>It’s a tension that buzzes through this new production – the first time the play has been seen in the north of England. Joe Gill plays John, the only named character, who confesses to his boyfriend, M, at the start to cheating on him with a woman, W. The play rolls through the fallout, rewinds to John’s first encounter with W, then culminates in them all meeting for a prickly dinner.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/20

Maybe not while alone, but as part of some desultory group chat. Though perhaps you rise above it – these are very hypothetical scenarios, after all. Who exactly is going to say that forever after you can only have starters or puddings? Donald Trump? It doesn’t strike me as his style.

I looked at the ingredients and there was no cocoa content percentage listed, just ‘cocoa liquor’. The chocolate, made in the US, is subject to FDA rules, which means that milk chocolate must contain at least 10% cocoa liquor and cocoa liquor can contain cocoa beans and cocoa butter.

<p>Tapping into just the kind of bloodlust that thrills in ancient Rome, Ridley Scott’s violent, spectacular sequel so resembles the original it could be a remake</p><p>“Are you not entertained?” bellowed Russell Crowe over the bodies of half a dozen or so armoured combatants in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/may/14/philipfrench">original </a><em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/may/14/philipfrench">Gladiator</a></em>. It’s a line etched in our collective memory. It also sums up Ridley Scott’s belligerent and punchy directorial approach to this brawny, businesslike sequel. Nearly a quarter of a century has passed since the first film scooped five Oscars in 2001 (including best picture and best actor for Crowe), but what’s notable is how little has changed. Admittedly there’s a splatter of fresh blood. <em>Gladiator II</em> passes the tunic and battle sandals to Paul Mescal, as enslaved but noble warrior Lucius. It sees Denzel Washington sink his teet

I’ve got this far on borrowed time: at some point my luck will run out.” Ward’s husband Richard wanders through their living room – briefly, they share a hand squeeze and smile. “So, usually, I’m asked to look miserable and solemn in photographs.

<p>A fifth defeat in succession, this time to South Africa, is latest evidence of the damaging limitations of this team</p><p>The charge of the heavy brigade ended face down in the dirt, an inch short of where it needed to be. One man up, nine points down, and with 11 minutes to play, England were right up on South Africa’s try-line, so close to the score they needed to grab control of the match. Harry Randall was sure he could get there, he went, one, two, three strides forwards towards the line, and was wrapped up in a tackle. Dan Cole came in after, gathered up the ball and pressed onwards. Cole made it all the way to the line, and no further. The South African tacklers held him there, and pressed his face down into the ground so he could watch the attack unravel behind him.</p><p>So the match-winning moment came, and went again, as it often seems to for this England team. It passed them by like a Springbok wing slipping a tackle. Afterwards, of course, they talked about the posit

Auerbach, who died last week aged 93, was already by then a figure of renowned artistic compulsion. Laurence Marks, whose interview ran alongside Bown’s portrait, marvelled at his “austere and solitary communion with his pictures”. Auerbach had arrived in Britain on a kindertransport aged seven, and after the war discovered that his parents had perished in concentration camps. Finding his vocation as an artist at 25, he had, Marks observed, subsequently “worked seven days a week, nearly every week of the year, starting at 7am and continuing until 9pm in the same studio in Mornington Crescent, painting the same handful of friends and the same half-dozen or so London scenes

And given the fuss she’s made of the straitened circumstances of the public finances, I would in any case have been naive to think she might have cut the UK’s famously high wine duty in her first Budget. But there is one aspect of the wine duty regime that I still hope she might fix: rethinking the introduction of a sliding scale where the duty increases with every 0.5% in the wine’s abv. First cooked up by one of Reeves’s wine-averse predecessors, Diet Coke-loving Rishi Sunak, the new system has been in place for more than a year now, with the transition from the previous regime initially smoothed by taxing all wines between 11.5% and 14.5% as if they were 12.5%.

<p>Limiting access to civic education in US schools leads people to be less well educated in basic principles</p><p>The reason Donald Trump won is because he exemplifies men who think only of themselves. Civic responsibility is about caring for others, for everyone, not just oneself, and the easiest way to defeat democracy is to limit access to civic education, which is what has happened in the US public schools over the last 40 years.</p><p>The people who support Trump are not less smart, but they are truly less well educated in these basic principles. It is this that makes it possible for them to abandon the morality of civil society. As for the women who support Trump, I am dumbfounded. All his supporters have voted against their own interests. They will lose their health care and there will be inflation due to tariffs that will make it even harder for them to make the mortgage.<br><strong>Margot Miller</strong><br>

<p>In their final meeting, the US president pressed China’s leader to prevent North Korea from further escalation in Ukraine. What we know on day 998</p><p><strong>US president Joe Biden has urged China’s leader Xi Jinping to dissuade North Korea from </strong><strong>deepening its support for Russia’s war on Ukraine, </strong>after Pyongyang’s<strong> </strong>deployment of troops in Moscow’s war with Ukraine have raised concerns in Washington, Beijing and European capitals. In their final meeting before the Trump administration takes over, the two leaders met Saturday on the sidelines of the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit. Biden pointed out that China’s “publicly stated position with respect to the war in Ukraine is there should be no escalation, no broadening the conflict, and the introduction of (Democratic People’s Republic of Korea) troops runs foursquare against that,” national security adviser Jake Sullivan said, adding that the president also pointed out Chi
