With Farming Simulator 23 faltering (and skipping most consoles), Farming Simulator 25 seemed like a strong homecoming for fans. The sheer number of machines, improved visuals and attention to detail, more crops, new farmsteads - what more could you want?

And make no mistake - this is the gameplay loop that fans love, from cultivating, ploughing, seeding, and harvesting to slowly discovering different types of crops, taking on contracts, and expanding your business. Unfortunately, this year's iteration is beset by questionable choices with the user interface, contract balancing, and lackluster polish.

Even the gorgeous visuals, which should be the experience of the highlight, suffer issues like flickering, pop-in, stuttering, and odd texture rendering. If Giants Software can polish it up enough, Farming Simulator 25 should be another solid iteration in the franchise. However, as of right now, it's a significant step down from the series' best.

It’s always hard to make concrete predictions in this particular arena, but with a strong license attached and the game itself looking increasingly promising in all that we have seen of it so far, it’s fair to say that there’s every reason for players to be optimistic. 

Ahead of the game’s imminent release, here, we’re going to go over a few key details that you should know about Marvel Rivals.
