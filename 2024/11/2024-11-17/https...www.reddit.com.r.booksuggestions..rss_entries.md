I&#39;m trying to get to a point where I&#39;ve curated books that fit the season we are in. For example, gothic, murder mystery, poe for October, LGBT books for June, Books about president&#39;s or American history for July, etc. Of course I am now trying to think what I can put out for Christmas/December but the only christmas book I think I have ever read is A Christmas Carol. I suppose you can make an argument for the Bible? But were not a very religious household. Are there any other good Holiday/Winter books I can display? Fiction or Nonfiction suggestions are welcome! I do tend to avoid romance. Not that I have anything against the genre I just don&#39;t want a guest to pick one up and open it up to an awkward page XD.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/littlenbee

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello! </p> <p>I’m looking for an audiobook for my husband and I to listen on our drive up to the in laws. He’s not a huge reader, but does like listening to audiobooks. Preferably something around 8 hours or less so we can finish on the round trip drive! The time is less important though because we can always finish it when we’re driving other times. </p> <p>I’m not that picky and will read pretty much anything! He likes books about war lol but can branch out for some adventure-type books. He doesn’t like dystopian fiction. He can also get behind some thrillers if they’re not too cheesy. Oh, and he really likes ships so bonus points if ships are involved!</p> <p>Some titles we’ve listened to in the past that he’s liked include Midnight in Chernobyl, The Wager, Nuclear War: A Scenario (although he didn’t love this one), City of Thieves, and Fallout </p> <p>TIA for any recommendations! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https:

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey Reddit and Booklovers, please help us. My best friend and I need help to find a book. My best friend found that book about 3 or 4 years ago on Amazon. We don&#39;t know the title, the author, or what the cover looks like. The book we are searching for is most likely enemies to lovers and dark romance. It&#39;s about a person whose parents were murdered, and now that person wants revenge and is kind of like an assassin. I think that person finds out who killed their parents and what to do to kill them, but that person falls in love with the son or daughter of the couple that killed the parents. It&#39;s definitely a romance about a girl and boy, but I&#39;m not sure which parents were murdered and which parents were the murderers. Either in the cover or the back, it says something about revenge and an assassin. My friend is not too sure about all the details, but that is what she remembers. The book must be a bit older. I really Hope we can find t

I am looking for something that is maybe historical fiction probably something based on the 40s-70s. I don’t like reading historical fiction that is war based as much but if there are other good elements I would be open to suggestions that were based on wartimes. Similarly, I really don’t want anything with too much romance either, but I would still be open as long as it isn’t the main focus. I really want a good simple read that leaves me thinking. I would also be open to other genres outside of historical fiction that aren’t romance. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Immediate-Way6879"> /u/Immediate-Way6879 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1gtgq6g/book_recs_for_someone_trying_to_get_into_reading/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <

I grew up in a strict religious household where I was held to high Christian standards- and yet watched my mother fall into alcoholism/drugs abuse. She was mentally/emotionally/physically abusive and my stepfather did little to protect me, in more instances I had to protect him and my younger sibling. All of this was kept secret in order for us to keep a good standing with the church, and now…. </p> <p>I’ve lost my ability to distinguish religion from my household and there is a lot of guilt and shame surrounding the entire subject.
