<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><h1>Astronomics</h1> <p>Space Exploration + Asteroid Mining Automation + Idle Manufacturing</p> <p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p> <p>Hello r/Games </p> <p>Astronomics is an asteroid mining automation game. Navigate your freighter to the asteroids passing through your deep space mining claim then pilot the shuttle to land on the surface where you&#39;ll explore and set up the infrastructure to automate the extraction of resources with the help of your faithful workerbots. Resources you bring back to the freighter can be refined or used in manufacturing.</p> <p>In dev news we continue our playtesting leading up to our January 2025 EA launch. An update this coming week will open up the third region in the asteroid belt for players to experience. If you have any interest in joining we still have some spots. Just hop on the discord and let me know. Below I have linked a youtube video detailing what awaits players in our current progression playtest.</p

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello <a href="/r/Games">r/Games</a>,</p> <p>I‚Äôm part of a team working on a retro-style T/SRPG game in the style of a Roguelite. It‚Äôs sort of like if Fire Emblem stuck to its permadeath roots mixed with the build-centric design of modern roguelikes.</p> <p>We‚Äôve been consistently updating <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2573790/Astral_Throne_Beta/">our game‚Äôs Beta</a> for community feedback, and we just released a new update! This one includes full controller support, and we‚Äôd like feedback on how we‚Äôve handled it. (Though, it‚Äôs a little janky on Steam Deck, a fix will be out later today or tomorrow, sorry!)</p> <p>I‚Äôve posted about this game on a fair few indie sundies before, but if this is your first time seeing Astral Throne, I‚Äôll explain it:</p> <h1>About the Game</h1> <ul> <li>The game plays like, well, Fire Emblem. Turn-based, grid-based, back-and-forth battles with unit recruitment, customization, and perma-death</li> <li>Parties
