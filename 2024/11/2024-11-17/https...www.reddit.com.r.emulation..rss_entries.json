It&#39;s working great for me, except for one thing: deinterlacing. It does bob or weave, and both look absolutely horrible to me. A choice between combing with moving, or flickering with static images.</p> <p>Is this just what it is, or am I missing something? How do you guys deal with it, and is there perhaps a fix or workaround to mitigate the effects?</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/sndwv001\"> /u/sndwv001 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/emulation/comments/1gth2lr/n64_parallel_and_deinterlacing/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/emulation/comments/1gth2lr/n64_parallel_and_deinterlacing/\">[comments]</a></span>", "id": 1532344, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/emulation/comments/1gth2lr/n64_parallel_and_deinterlacing", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 475, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/emulation/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "N64, ParaLLEl and deinterlacing", "vote": 0}]
