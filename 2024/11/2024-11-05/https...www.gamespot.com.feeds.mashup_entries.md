<p>Although Ron Gilbert came back to the Monkey Island franchise with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/return-to-monkey-island-review-happiness-is-a-warm-manatee/1900-6417961/">Return To Monkey Island</a> in 2022, it's unclear when or if the series will ever get another official sequel. But that hasn't stopped a group of die-hard Monkey Island fans from making their own unofficial game, The Booze of Monkey Island.</p><p>The new title is descripted as a "love letter" to the classic Monkey Island games by small studio Bean Adventure Agency, which created The Booze of Monkey Island. Like the games that came before it, players are put into the role of Guybrush Threepwood in a point-and-click adventure. This isn't a full-length game, but it seems to recapture the flavor of its predecessors.</p><div data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXlVoACoUmk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xXlVoA

## Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge Of The Seven Review

<p dir="ltr">SaGa stands as one of Square Enix's longest-running series, but it's also had a rough time outside of Japan. If you pick up a random SaGa game, you'll probably understand why: SaGa games are JRPGs that don't do things in the way most overseas players would expect. SaGa tends to focus more on complex, interweaving systems of combat, character growth, and questing. And that's supplemented by narratives that tend to act more as connective tissue that link locations and objectives together instead of the sprawling, character-driven stories the genre has become known for. Wandering around blindly and piecing out what to do and how things work in a SaGa game can be incredibly compelling, but some entries in the franchise lean toward immensely frustrating. Romancing SaGa 2 is more the former than the latter, but its earlier releases were still an acquired taste.</p><p dir="ltr">Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge of the Seven is a full-on remake of a game many fans consider the series' a

## The Remarkable Life Of Ibelin Review - The Real Warcraft Movie

<p dir="ltr">The Remarkable Life of Ibelin isn't the first Warcraft film, but it is definitely the best one. Duncan Jones's big-budget Warcraft from 2016 focused on the "main" characters of developer Blizzard's long-running sword-and-sorcery universe. This new Netflix documentary from director Benjamin Ree, released a month prior to World of Warcraft's 20th anniversary, instead puts its focus on WoW's actual protagonists: the players who call Azeroth home. Specifically, it tells the story of Mats "Ibelin" Steen, and in the process paints an incredible portrait of a digital life, one that drives home a core message of how online friends and relationships built in virtual worlds have the power to be every bit as meaningful as ones made in the real world. While that thesis is hardly a revelation for anyone who has spent a significant amount of time playing WoW or online games in general over the past two decades, The Remarkable Life of Ibelin still manages to make a profound impact.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-immortal/">Diablo Immortal</a> is celebrating 20 years of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/">World of Warcraft</a> in a big way, with a limited-time Lich King boss battle, a new PvP battleground modeled after WoW's Arathi Basin, Murloc familiar skins, and a whole bunch of free and paid cosmetics.</p><p dir="ltr">From November 13 through December 11 in Blizzard's mobile game, players will be able to throw down with the Lich King (Arthas) himself, who--after 30 years of Warcraft and 20 years of WoW--remains one of the franchise's most iconic characters. Arthas will use many of his signature abilities during the battle, including summoning ghouls and abominations to fight at his command.</p><div data-embed-type="video" data-ref-id="2300-6464038" data-src="/videos/diablo-immortal-official-tempest-character-class-gameplay-reveal-trailer/2300-6464038/" data-width="854" data-height="480" data-video-start="0">

<p>Game designer Ben Hinchliffe worked at Rockstar Games for more than a decade, and he contributed to games like Grand Theft Auto V, Red Dead Redemption II, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/">Grand Theft Auto VI</a> before leaving the company in 2022. In a new interview, Hinchliffe briefly discussed GTA VI, saying he believes the game will "blow people away" and be a smashing success when it comes to sales.</p><p>"It will sell an absolute ton, as it always does. People will be talking about it for ages afterwards, just like they do with GTA 5," Hinchliffe told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5mzJsGhmr4">GTA VI O'clock</a>. "I think they've raised the bar again. They always do, and they have done again with GTA 6."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/GTAVI_Countdown/status/1853287550774804935" data-has-image="true"><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" da

<p>N7 Day, which celebrates the Mass Effect series, is coming up on November 7. It's historically a day when BioWare makes some kind of tease or announcement about the franchise, and with a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/next-mass-effect/">new game in the works</a>, many are wondering what kind of reveal may be on tap.</p><p>In a statement, BioWare attempted to temper expectations. The studio said this N7 Day specifically will be "quieter" due to the launch of Dragon Age: The Veilguard less than a week ago. That being said, BioWare teased that it has "a little fun" to share for N7 Day.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/bioware/status/1853552873138720920?s=46&amp;t=gp9HY1NQP1eeZxZoq0Xxsw" data-has-image="false"><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">We hope everyone is enjoying their time in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DragonAge?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc^tfw">#Drago

<p>Nintendo's newly <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendos-new-alarmo-clock-already-has-a-day-one-update/1100-6527097/">released Alarmo</a> is only intended to be an expensive digital alarm clock with themes and graphics taken from popular Nintendo Switch titles. But some very talented hackers seem very determined to turn the Alarmo into something that can do other things, too. Now, just under a month since its release, someone has put a playable version of Doom on Alarmo, along with video proof of the accomplishment.</p><div data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IOVYvSMAoU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5IOVYvSMAoU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>The hacker in question is GaryOderNichts, who previously worked out a way to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendos

<p>Just over a month ago, Konami and developer Bloober Team released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/silent-hill-2-remake-review-born-from-a-wish/1900-6418296/">Silent Hill 2</a>, a remake of the classic survival-horror title that debuted in 2001. One of the new touches included by Bloober Team was a series of enigmatic photographs that can be found throughout the remake. Now, a player has come forward with the solution to the photo puzzle, and it's a callback to the history of the game itself.</p><p>Dale Robinson unveiled his findings on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1gine5k/comment/lvcy9t2/">Reddit</a>, and he appears to be the first player to figure it out. There are 26 of these photos that can be found within the game, and they all include a short phrase. For example, the first photograph is captioned "So many people here." Robinson examined the photos and realized that the visual clue for the code was the amount of certain objects in each image.

## Unsurprisingly, Call Of Duty: Black Ops 6 Was One Of The Most-Played Games On PC And Console Last Month

Circana's data tracked the most popular games by player engagement each week across PC via Steam, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S, and as you'd expect, Call of Duty shot to the top almost instantly.</p><p>What's interesting here is that Circana's lists covered games up until October 26, a mere day after the launch of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6. It's also worth noting that Call of Duty HQ was on the list, not Black Ops 6 specifically, as the launcher for all CoD games was in the top spot on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S. While Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 was likely the main reas
