How to waterproof shower wall corners…I apply mortar with my 5” joint compound knife add more with the KERDI trowel. Then I embed the banding and compress it tight into the corner. Excess mortar is removed with my sponge and I ensure the KERDI-BAND is flat, which is important for tile work. Many thanks to Schluter for providing supplies for this custom shower 👍🏽🔥#showerremodel #schluter #bathroomremodel #brandpartner
