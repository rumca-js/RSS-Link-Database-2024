At the end of the last global ice age, the deep-frozen Earth reached a built-in limit of climate change and thawed into a slushy planet. Results from a Virginia Tech-led study provide the first direct geochemical evidence of the slushy planet—otherwise known as the "plumeworld ocean" era—when sky-high carbon dioxide levels forced the frozen Earth into a massive, rapid melting period.

One thing we've learned in recent decades is that exoplanets are surprisingly common. So far, we've confirmed nearly 6,000 planets, and we have evidence for thousands more. Most of these planets were discovered using the transit method. though there are other methods as well. Many stars are known to have multiple planets, such as the TRAPPIST-1 system with seven Earth-sized worlds.

A recent study has aimed to create hydrophobic paper by exploiting the mechanical properties and water resistance of cellulose nanofibers, and so produce a sustainable, high-performance material suitable for packaging and biomedical devices. This involved a supramolecular approach, i.e., combining short chains of proteins (peptide sequences) that do not chemically modify the cellulose nanofibers. Sustainable hydrophobic paper may one day replace petroleum-related products.

Accurately modeling particle movement through fluids is crucial in fields ranging from chemical engineering to aerospace. The drag coefficient, which influences how particles settle and move in fluid environments, is a core factor in these calculations. While the behavior of spherical particles is well understood, predicting the drag coefficient of irregularly shaped particles has long been a challenge. These complexities have highlighted the need for a more sophisticated approach to model particle-fluid interactions, especially for non-spherical particles.

Considered one of the fastest-growing agricultural frontiers in Brazil, and the area with the highest greenhouse gas emissions in the Cerrado, Brazil's savanna-type biome, the region known as MATOPIBA, risks facing water shortages in the years ahead. Water overuse may mean that between 30% and 40% of demand for crop irrigation cannot be met in the period 2025-40. MATOPIBA is a portmanteau of the names of four states—Maranhão, Tocantins, Piauí, and Bahia (all but Tocantins are located in Brazil's Northeast region).

And all it takes to woo a male is the sound of a female's wingbeats. Imagine researchers' surprise when a single change completely killed the mosquitoes' libidos.
