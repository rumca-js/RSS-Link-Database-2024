Intel has an optional \"RL-ILM\" (Reduced Load Independent Loading Mechanism) that appears to be present on most high-end boards right now; however, lower end boards will possibly have the cheaper \"Standard ILM,\" which more closely mirrors previous Intel ILM solutions.\n\nBUY OUR NEW SNOWFLAKE DICE SET: https://store.gamersnexus.net/products/snowflake-full-tabletop-mtg-dnd-premium-dice-set-7-piece-dice-wooden-box-cat-card\nBUY OUR NEW INDUCTOR DICE SET: https://store.gamersnexus.net/products/inductor-full-tabletop-mtg-dnd-premium-dice-set-7-piece-dice-wooden-box-token-card\n\nWatch our video researching coldplate flatness when we made the 'perfect' CPU cooler: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BMYsMGpyFY\nWatch our Noctua NH-D15 G2 review for more context: https://www.youtube.com", "id": 1453958, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOTpkf4rVPQ", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 428, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UChIs72whgZI9w6d6FhwGGHA", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/GOTpkf4rVPQ/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Intel Unbends Its CPUs: 285K RL-ILM vs. Standard ILM Laser, Pressure, & Thermal Benchmarks", "vote": 0}]
