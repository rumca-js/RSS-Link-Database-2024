NanoGraf’s silicon oxide-graphene (SOG) batteries aren’t just an upgrade to lithium - they’re versatile enough for everything from phones and backup storage to EVs. They’re for STUBs—small tactical universal batteries—like radios and other compact devices. So, why go for high-tech batteries in small gear, and why silicon oxide and graphene? Could this be a compelling next-gen battery for the rest of us?
