<p>Meta will allow US government agencies and contractors in national security roles to use its Llama AI. The move relaxes Meta’s acceptable use policy restricting what others can do with the large language models it develops, and brings Llama ever so slightly closer to the generally accepted definition of open-source AI.</p>



<p>Llama will be available to US government agencies and private sector partners, including Lockheed Martin, Microsoft, and Amazon, to support applications like logistics planning, cybersecurity, and threat assessment, Meta’s president of global affairs Nick Clegg wrote in a blog post Monday.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/amazons-ceo-says-genai-growing-faster-than-cloud-computing-did-8738034">The public cloud market is seeing exploding growth</a>, and it’s easy to understand why. The interest in <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3689973/what-is-generative-ai-artificial-intelligence-that-creates.html">generative AI</a> has sent enterprises running to their public cloud console to allocate even more resources, including data storage and compute, which tend to be higher-end and more costly.</p>

<p>Data scientists and technologists responsible for data governance, engineering, and integration should look for opportunities to use data analytics and AI for strategic decision-making. Finance, marketing, and sales departments all have important use cases, such as tracking cash flow, managing advertising campaigns, and prioritizing sales prospects.</p>



<p>One area that interests all business leaders is revenue forecasting, as all departments provide inputs into revenue forecasting models and manage budgets that depend on them. However, accurately forecasting revenue is a significant challenge. In the <a href="https://www.xactlycorp.com/resources/guides/2024-sales-forecasting-benchmark-repor

<p>There has been a lot of speculation about what <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3689973/what-is-generative-ai-artificial-intelligence-that-creates.html">generative AI</a> can do for businesses. The possibilities are endless — streamlined creative processes, automated business operations, self-service for customers, and more. Indeed the productivity implications of generative AI are huge, prompting McKinsey to assert that the technology could add <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-economic-potential-of-generative-AI-the-next-productivity-frontier#key-insights">trillions of dollars in value to the global economy</a>. </p>
