Typically, the hash of the public key is embedded within the MCUboot binary, ensuring its integrity. For enhanced tamper protection, this hash can also be securely stored and retrieved using hardware keys. Embedded SoCs, such as the i.MX RT, offer advanced security features like High Assurance Boot (HAB), Data Co-Processor (DCP), and Trusted Firmware-M (TF-M) for implementing TrustZone in SoCs like the nRF91. These features enable secure storage with hardware crypto acceleration or external security modules (e.g., TPM, EdgeLock) to store keys in a hardware vault.\n\nThis presentation will explore MCUboot secure booting with hardware keys, using the NXP i.MX RT as an example. We'll delve into HAB for booting signed and encrypted MCUboot, establishing a hardware root of trust, and booting Zephyr RTOS using ", "id": 1458624, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2-dytKj1TU", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 499, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCfX55Sx5hEFjoC3cNs6mCUQ", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/F2-dytKj1TU/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Secure and Encrypted Boot in Zephyr RTOS - Parthiban N, Linumiz", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-11-05T18:06:26+00:00", "description": "Sponsored by Highlight\n\nAs artificial intelligence (AI) transforms the software landscape, optimizing AI application performance becomes crucial.
