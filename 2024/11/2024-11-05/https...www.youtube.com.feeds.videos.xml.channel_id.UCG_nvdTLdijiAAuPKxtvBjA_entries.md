Joker 2: Folie a Deux unites Arthur Fleck with Harley Quinn. And as weird as it sounds, the movie is horrendous. It was rated poorly and lost around 200 million dollars? Why?

It's a sequel with massive core problems that sequels cannot have if they want to succeed. And so today, let's look more into that and roast the movie as well as possible.
