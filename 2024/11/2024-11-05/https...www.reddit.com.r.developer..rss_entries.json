I truly believe this could be a game-changer for both professionals and enthusiastic hobbyists, especially if we manage to get it off the ground with the limited resources I currently have.</p> <p>Here\u2019s the problem: the type of work this tool would handle requires specialized knowledge that&#39;s hard to find. For businesses, finding qualified people is a real challenge, and when they do, the process tends to be really time-consuming. I think if we could make this tool work, it would be easy to market to companies in this niche around the world.</p> <p>For hobbyists and enthusiasts, this tool could be a huge help too. It would allow them to perform highly technical tasks with just some basic understanding. I\u2019m imagining it like this: watch a couple of general YouTube videos, and you\u2019re good to go.</p> <h1>About the Sa", "id": 1459268, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1gkfnxc/seeking_help_to_build_a_saas_mvp_for_a_niche", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 508, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Seeking Help to Build a SaaS MVP for a Niche Market - Open to Collaborations", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-11-05T14:09:24+00:00", "description": "<table> <tr><td> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1gk7iym/autoanalyst_adding_marketing_analytics_ai_agents/\"> <img src=\"https://external-preview.redd.it/G-CRyWE7MuoXGdEPnHhApngYiZlQtJkh96W3PoqUcZ0.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f8f870809ba2f65f0ef4c3bf835c6d77f88f47a\" alt=\"Auto-Analyst \u2014 Adding marketing analytics AI agents\" title=\"Auto-Analyst \u2014 Adding marketing analytics AI agents\" /> </a> </td><td> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/phicreative1997\"> /u/phicreative1997 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://medium.com/firebird-technologies/auto-analyst-adding-marketing-analytics-ai-agents-45b3e1f6654c\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1gk7iym/autoanalyst_adding_marketing_analytics_ai_agents/\">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>", "id": 1457137, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1gk7iym/autoanalyst_adding_marketing_analytics_ai_agents", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 508, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://external-preview.redd.it/G-CRyWE7MuoXGdEPnHhApngYiZlQtJkh96W3PoqUcZ0.jpg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=0f8f870809ba2f65f0ef4c3bf835c6d77f88f47a", "title": "Auto-Analyst \u2014 Adding marketing analytics AI agents", "vote": 0}]
