LignoSat, named after the Latin word for wood, was developed by Kyoto University and a company called Sumitomo Forestry. It was included in a SpaceX mission to the International Space Station (ISS) and will soon be released into orbit above the Earth.</p>
<p>Why do this? There are two main reasons. First of all, it’ll be a test as to the durability of wood when faced with the harsh conditions of space. If successful, the researchers plan on making more wooden structures and jettisoning them to the cosmos.</p>

<p>The block button on X has <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/x-now-lets-blocked-users-see-your-posts-130020841.html">changed</a>. Now, it allows blocked users to see posts of the accounts that blocked them, but they still can’t interact with those accounts. You also can’t follow or message the user.</p>
<p>X previously said it was making the change because users can already see and interact with blocked accounts by switching to a non-blocked account. X also said blocking the old way could be used to share and hide harmful or private information about those they’ve blocked, so the new feature allows “greater transparency.”</p>
<p>Experts on social-media abuse disagree, noting these changes will help stalkers and trolls. “Enabling blocked users to see posts is catering to abusers and stalkers, indulging and facilitating their behaviors,” wrote London Victims’ Commissioner Claire Waxman last month.</p>

The demo Bungie presented at E3 way back in 2003 showed the future of Halo and demonstrated what the Xbox, as a console, was capable of. It even featured gameplay that never made its way to the finished game. &quot;The response to the demo at E3 was electric,&quot; Halo community director Brian Jarrard said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a long-time Mint user, I was frustrated to say the least when news broke at the end of 2023 that Intuit would shut Mint down. I, like millions of others, enjoyed how easily Mint allowed us to track all accounts in one place and monitor credit scores. I also used it regularly to track spending, set goals like pay my mortgage down faster and with general money management.<br><br>So I set out to find a Mint alternative in the wake of its disappointing demise.
