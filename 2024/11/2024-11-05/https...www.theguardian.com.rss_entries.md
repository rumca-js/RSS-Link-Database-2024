I only downloaded my first app in 2021 and this is no word of a lie.

<p>For one brief moment, you wondered if it might happen again. With eight minutes to go between the clubs who have won this competition more than anyone else, and Real Madrid 3-1 down, Antonio Rüdiger guided a shot into the net that might have been a bugle call, a call to arms, madness gripping this place again and ushering in another of those wild finales. This time though there was no comeback and no epic, only reality. Justice too. Rüdiger had been offside and the goal was ruled out, the illusion lasting only as long as the VAR check, leaving Milan striding to a victory they thoroughly deserved.</p><p>Goals from Malick Thiaw, the exceptional Tijjani Reijnders and the tireless Spain captain Álvaro Morata – of course – secured a win Milan badly needed and inflicted Madrid’s first Champions League defeat here since <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/12/real-madrid-chelsea-champions-league-quarter-final-second-leg-match-report">Chelsea won 3-2 in April 2022</a>.

<p>Brendan Rodgers used pre-match media duties to call for Celtic’s supporters to refrain from using pyrotechnics during the visit of RB Leipzig. Fireworks appeared alright, on the field as Rodgers and his team delivered the kind of performance which the manager yearned for when returning for a second Celtic tenure. Celtic find themselves in a hugely exciting Champions League position, having seen off the team sitting second top of the Bundesliga in a manner which belied years of struggles at this level. Rodgers was perfectly entitled to revel in it. Celtic are proving they can swim in a bigger pond, which serves as a credit to their manager.</p><p>Leipzig’s display was muted. Still, it would be unreasonable not to emphasise the part Celtic played in that. The hosts attacked with patience and purpose. They defended pretty comfortably. Pieced together, this will rank among Celtic’s finest European performances of recent times. Leipzig had no answer, to the point where they looked a be

One of the campaign’s top-tier b@nter clubs, they made an outcast of their captain and club legend Joe Worrall, all the better to free up dressing-room space for at least one of the 4,189 new signings they’d made before it began. In December they sacked their gaffer and replaced him with an apparently beaten managerial docket famously described on a certain podcast not a million miles from here as looking like “a sad Jedi” following his disastrous, short reign at Spurs.

<p>One wrote six sonatas and claimed they were by Haydn. Another used a ghostwriter to write his symphony – and pretended to be deaf. So how did they manage to hoodwink the experts? </p><p>In 1993, completely out of the blue, the Austrian pianist Paul Badura-Skoda was sent a photocopy of a manuscript purporting to be six lost Haydn keyboard sonatas. It came with a letter from a little-known flautist from Münster, Germany called Winfried Michel, who told Badura-Skoda that he’d been given it by an elderly lady whose identity he could not reveal.</p><p>Badura-Skoda was suspicious, but once he played the music, he became sure that the works were real. He asked his wife Eva, a musicologist, to examine the manuscript. Although the music wasn’t in Haydn’s hand, she believed it to be an authentic copyist’s score dating from around 1805 and originating in Italy. They checked with the Haydn scholar, HC Robbins Landon, and he too was convinced. He penned an article for BBC Music Magazine, headl

<p>John Kennedy sparred with the Swedes over Mamma Mia! and took on the Rolling Stones for Richard Ashcroft – he tells us why he’s still arguing with Bob Geldof after 40 years</p><p>Music lawyers are typically mandated to be much less exciting than the artists they represent, but John Kennedy could give most hotel-trashing stars a run for their money. When I speak to him, he’s recently finished up “the worst argument ever” with Bob Geldof, with whom he has worked closely with for four decades on Band Aid. “Our arguments get worse every month. But that’s because he’s so intense and still so passionate. He is unbelievably brilliant.”</p><p>Forty years since he was hired, Kennedy still does 25 hours of legal work a month for the Band Aid Charitable Trust, all voluntary. His newly published memoir, Just for One Hour: Moments I Pinched Myself in the Music Industry, takes its title from Geldof’s initial insistence that an hour of legal advice was all it would take.

<p>Exhibition on Screen’s latest gallery documentary offers a walkthrough of the National Gallery’s winter show, complete with extras</p><p>There’s a steepled-fingers argument to be had about whether live-event or gallery movies can ever compare to the thrill of seeing things for real and, furthermore, whether they undermine the in-person culture economy. The counter-argument, of course, is that these event films extend an opera/play/show’s reach and give access to an audience who would otherwise never get to experience it, even at one remove. Well, this is something the estimable Exhibition on Screen brand has no doubt had to confront over the years; by combining insightful critical commentary as well as suitably graceful in-gallery camerawork, their films operate as a watchable counterpoint to the live experience – as well as, more often than not, moving beyond a single-exhibition focus, like their <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/23/tokyo-stories-review-artistic-

We hear about how Sony produced a high-end machine laser targeted at producing fast 3D graphics, while Sega’s engineers had to add an extra graphics chip to the Saturn at the last minute. We read that Sony’s Ken Kutaragi provided creators with a much more user-friendly development system. We know that Sony undercut the price of Sega’s machine, using its might as a consumer electronics giant to take the financial hit. All of that is true, but what aren’t always mentioned are the vast success of the Japanese Saturn l

I will balance the sweetness of the flesh with a miso sauce into which I have also stirred mustard and lemon juice. Basted as the pumpkin roasts, the dark dressing will balance the pumpkin’s more candied notes. Sweet and a little spicy – just the thing for a cold night around the bonfire.</p><p>Preheat the oven to 200C/gas mark 6. Cut 750g of <strong>pumpkin</strong> into slim wedges, removing any seeds and fibres as you go. Place the slices in a single layer in a roasting tin (or as near as possible, depending on its size), then spoon 3 tbsp of <strong>groundnut oil</strong> over the pumpkin.

Wood gives a lovely performance as failed Vegas magician Strawn Wise, who flies halfway round the world to New Zealand to look after the daughter he’s never met; she is the bookworm of the title, precocious 11-year-old Mildred (Nell Fisher).</p><p>In the film’s opening scenes, we watch as Mildred’s mother (Morgana O’Reilly) is hospitalised by a freak toaster accident. Mildred has never met her dad (though she discovered reading mum’s diary that she was conceived in a car park on a girls’ trip to Vegas). But with mum in a coma, Strawn arrives to look after her – cutting slightly

<p>This sober but compelling study of the man who radically transformed treatment at an Algerian hospital explores the link between mental illness and imperialist violence</p><p>Having previously co-directed a documentary on revolutionary thinker and psychologist Frantz Fanon, Algerian film-maker Abdenour Zahzah channels this research into his sober fiction feature debut. Shot on location in black and white, the film charts Fanon’s time as the head doctor of a psychiatric ward in the Algerian city of Blida. After his arrival in 1953, he would soon revolutionise the racist and antiquated practices employed by the institution, which segregated its French Christian patients from their Algerian Muslim counterparts.</p><p>Fanon’s achievements during his tenure are recounted in an episodic, vignette-like fashion. From incorporating creative and athletic activities as a part of therapy to implementing more humane treatments for the Indigenous patients, he radically transformed the hospital.

<p>Mickaël Bandela’s documentary reflects on the events that left him in care as a child, and the generational losses that came before</p><p>When he was a few months old, film-maker Mickaël Bandela was put into the care of his foster mother Marie-Thérèse, after his own home was deemed unsuitable for the wellbeing of a small child. Throughout the next decades, his birth mother Gisèle remained a loving presence in his life. At the same time, the erratic infrequency of her visits left deep wounds on Bandela’s sense of self, scars that were reopened when he welcomed his first child. A soul-baring work of searing authenticity, Bandela’s searching documentary grapples with the complexities of motherhood and the long shadows of family trauma.</p><p>Bandela’s voiceover acts as an emotional compass and a guiding force throughout the film, which stitches together interviews with his two maternal figures, family photos, and various home and personal footage shot over the course of three decades

<p>If the end is nigh, I’d rather invest for the short term</p><p><strong>If the end of the world is really nigh, should I be investing in shorter-term savings schemes rather than a pension? I currently contribute 20% of my £117,000 salary to my pension and my employer pays 5%. I’m 44 and worry about imminent world wars over dwindling resources. I find it hard to believe a peaceful 20-year retirement beckons. Is there a way to invest in things I could access quickly if the poop really does hit the fan?<br></strong><em><strong>LW, Derbyshire</strong></em></p><p>I sincerely hope your fears prove unfounded, but apocalyptic predictions will be prompting many to ask the same question. However, decisions around pension savings should not be taken lightly. I consulted Helen Morrissey, head of retirement analysis at Hargreaves Lansdown. She points out that your pension is not necessarily locked away until you reach state pension age and you can access a private pension pot at 55. The age lim
