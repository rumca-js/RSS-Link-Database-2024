<p>A new photography book captures the ramshackle squats and grimy venues that were a playground for confrontationally uncommercial early-90s bands like My Bloody Valentine, Stereolab and Silverfish</p><p>A while back, photographer Joe Dilworth found himself talking to the drummer in a currently successful British rock band. He asked how they got started, expecting to hear about low-rent gigs, and was startled to find the drummer talking about their business plan. “He told me they’d got loans, from their parents I think, and they paid themselves 20 grand a year until they got signed.” Dilworth laughs. “They’d treated it like a startup. They’d viewed playing small gigs as a kind of loss leader.”</p><p>It was a conversation from which you could infer a lot about the state of music in the 21st century, but it got Dilworth thinking about the bands he’d photographed in north London in the late 80s and early 90s: pictures of tiny, unruly gigs (“the band were always in cigarette-lighting di

<p>Hockey has a rocky history in Salt Lake City but fans are flocking to see its new franchise. The team hopes it can build long-term stability</p><p>“The fact has become very clear to us this year that, economically, hockey just does not work in this market,” Larry H Miller told a press conference in March 1994, announcing that he’d sold the minor league Salt Lake Golden Eagles to a group in Detroit headed by the then-owner of the NBA’s Detroit Pistons. The Golden Eagles needed 7,000 people a game in the Delta Center, Miller told reporters that day, and “if you look at the paid attendance, we’re not quite halfway there.” The fact was, Miller said, “the natural, homegrown fanbase just isn’t here.”</p><p>A couple of days later, some members of that small fanbase grumbled to the Salt Lake Tribune that, despite the financial picture, things could have turned around. “Now is the time for hockey,” Pat Kremers, president of the Screamin’ Eagles Booster Club, told the paper, noting that the

<p>Since its inception in 1967, the Montreux jazz festival in Switzerland has hosted a dizzying array of musical talent from the world of jazz and beyond: Ella Fitzgerald, David Bowie and Miles Davis, and more recently Kendrick Lamar, Lady Gaga and Stormzy. The names behind its poster designs are equally illustrious, including Andy Warhol, Keith Haring, Niki de Saint Phalle and Julian Opie; the latest, by London-based artist Lakwena, commemorates Nina Simone’s 1976 performance. “Artists are given full creative freedom,” says the festival’s CEO Mathieu Jaton. “The festival’s posters reflect the times and artistic trends in which they were created. They showcase the evolution of visual arts over the past 60 years: from photography and painting to purely graphic works.”</p><ul><li>The Montreux jazz festival 2025 lineup will be revealed next April.

<p>Museum dedicated to founder of republic is marking ‘improved’ relations between Greece and Turkey – and changes in Turkey itself</p><p>This autumn, Ozlem Karakus, her son Ali and cousin Cansu made the long drive from Ankara to Thessaloniki. Their three-day odyssey had a single goal: to get to the three-storey, Ottoman-style building on Apostolou Pavlou Street in the Greek port city where Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the founder of the Turkish republic, was born and spent his early years. “He is our father,” Karakus said of the soldier-statesman who created the modern nation from the ruins of the Ottoman empire just over a century ago. “Atatürk is incredibly important to us. He is the best leader who ever came into this world.”</p><p>For the 43-year-old tax inspector, it was a “dream come true” to visit the house. “To come here and see his birthplace has meant so much,” she enthused. “It was wonderful even if I would have liked to have seen more from his childhood, a few more belongings,

But when his friend pulled out a bag of white powder, “I did what anybody else would do at 20 years old. I tried it,” he says. “And I found it really fun, to be honest.” The floaty feeling, like he’d been lifted out of his own body, was “euphoric”, he says. “Like you’re in a fairy world.”</p><p>Sixteen years later, reality is biting hard.

<p>Over the past 20 years, the symbol of remembrance for the war dead has become increasingly ubiquitous – and a culture of poppy policing has grown with it</p><p>In autumn 2003, about six months after Britain invaded Iraq, Paul Mace had a thought: what if we put poppies on football shirts? Mace, who was then executive director of Leicester City, had always felt strongly about the annual poppy appeal – his father had served in the second world war – and this, he hoped, would bring it to another level.</p><p>After securing permission from the Premier League, Mace had to find someone to design and manufacture an embroidered poppy patch for the shirts. Poppies in the UK are supplied by a charity, the Royal British Legion (RBL), to raise funds for ex-service personnel in need, but since the RBL didn’t produce patches, Mace arranged to auction off the shirts afterwards and donate the funds.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/nov/05/has-poppymania-gone-too-far">Continue

<p>The choreographer describes her challenging film shoot in the Spanish desert, where dancers are pitted against scorpions, fierce winds and punishing sun</p><p>It is a chilly 6am start in late May in the Almerían desert and everyone heads to the catering truck like homing pigeons. It is difficult not to feel like intruders in this fragmented and erratic landscape dotted with dark towering rocks, dry sandy gullies and patches of scrub. We are advised not to kick any stones in case it disturbs snakes or scorpions. Fortified with just the right dose of anxiety, we begin filming.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2024/nov/05/shobana-jeyasingh-dance-dont-say-my-name">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From traditional rural Republicans who won’t vote for Trump to Latino voters who will, <strong>Michael Safi</strong> finds voters taking surprising stances as he embarks on a road trip through the biggest swing state in the US</p><p>This weekend, just before US voters headed to the polls, <strong>Michael Safi</strong> took a road trip through Pennsylvania. He headed out on Route 222, for years known locally as the “road to nowhere” after planning problems stalled its completion. Today the highway runs through towns such as Lancaster and Allentown, offering a glimpse of the rural and urban areas of the biggest swing state in the US election.</p><p>In this rust belt state Michael discovered how the Trump v Harris race has scrambled political allegiances. In a modern art gallery in Lancaster he met an artist who told him how traditional rural Republicans, like his own parents, had turned away from Donald Trump’s divisive rhetoric. But he also met urban voters who insisted Trump was a
