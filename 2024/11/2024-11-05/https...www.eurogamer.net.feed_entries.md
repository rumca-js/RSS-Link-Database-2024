Following a seemingly solid launch for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>, there's probably a fair few series newcomers considering delving into the original trilogy. But anyone hoping for a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioware-shares-detailed-breakdown-of-mass-effect-legendary-editions-extensive-changes">Mass Effect: Legendary Edition style remaster</a> shouldn't hold their breath; Dragon Age: The Veilguard creative director John Epler says the project would be challenging because hardly anyone left at BioWare knows how the studio's old engine works.

Not content with throwing load of <em>documented</em> new features into <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a> on mobile with this week's long-awaited 1.6 update, it turns out developer Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone also chucked in a pretty major unannounced one too; a secret experimental multiplayer mode is now available to mobile players, if they're feeling sufficiently brave.

## Fear the Spotlight review - lo-fi horror that's light on scares but big on heart

<img src="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Fear-the-Spotlight-screenshot.jpg?width=1920&height=1920&fit=bounds&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp" /> <p>Why is it that games don't draw more often from the realms of musical theatre? I'd argue they're just as much a part of our cultural fabric as films and TV shows, but for whatever reason they very rarely manage to get a look in. Sure, they might not be the first thing that 30-something-year-old white men look for on their tapestry of pop culture references, but for a <em>certain</em> sub-section of the gaming population, a dialogue exchange riffing on the lyrics of Les Mis&eacute;rables, say (shout out to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subsurface-circular">Subsurface Circular</a>), is just as likely to elicit a delighted fist pump from me than yet another Twin Peaks reference in something like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alan-wake-2-the-lake-house-dlc-review">Alan Wake</a>, for example.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.

After all, many are born from the technological limitations and desires of the time. They shine brightly, usually because there's nothing else like them around. The problem comes when you take a game from that era and try to make it work somewhere else. That's when things start to go awry.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/speedball-is-back-from-the-dead-but-dont-get-too-excited">Read more</a></p>
