Our question is about a card (Hill-Trolls) which says to replace any 2 regular Sauron units on the board with 2 elites. Furthermore there is a section in the rules which says that recruitment via a card can recruit in beseiged settlements, if we didn&#39;t interpret it incorrectly. Does this also apply to replacement?

The game works a bit like Heat in that all players commit their cards in secret, then reveal what they committed and take the actions they can. The way movement and initiative are resolved is by committing cards as \u201cMove\u201d cards \u2014 the player who committed the most of their cards as \u201cMoves\u201d goes first. I like this because it means you can be sure to go first, but you have to sacrifice the actions you could otherwise take to further your objective to do so. Imagine a carnivore is next to an herbivore on the battlefield and needs to Bite them to finish them off and complete their objective to win. The carnivore commits 4 cards as \u201cMove\u201d and one as a \u201cBite\u201d, but the Herbivore reveals that they committed their whole hand as \u201cMove\u201d and acts first to escape and get one crucial hex away.
