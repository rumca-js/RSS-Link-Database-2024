Maricopa County, Arizona’s largest jurisdiction, is cracking down on security after protests in 2020. It is one of the most fiercely contested battlegrounds and may be one of the last to be called in the 2024 presidential election between former president Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris. 

Violent threats in 2020 as a result of President Joe Biden winning Maricopa County and Arizona caused many election workers to step away from the public sector, including Ken Matta. WSJ’s Ben Solomon spoke with Matta, who explains the new reality for election security.

Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump both capped off a whirlwind tour of battleground states before Election Day. 

Harris has tried repeatedly to signal that she will not be a continuation of Joe Biden’s presidency and that she will work with Republicans to solve problems facing Americans like immigration and the economy. Trump has tried to convince voters that things were better with him as president and that the country will fall apart if Democrats are in charge. 

WSJ’s Damian Paletta breaks down the closing arguments in the final stretch of the race.
