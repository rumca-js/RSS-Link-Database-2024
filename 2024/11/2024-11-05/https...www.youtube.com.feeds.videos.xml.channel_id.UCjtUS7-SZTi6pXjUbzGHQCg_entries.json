NanoGraf\u2019s silicon oxide-graphene (SOG) batteries aren\u2019t just an upgrade to lithium - they\u2019re versatile enough for everything from phones and backup storage to EVs. They\u2019re for STUBs\u2014small tactical universal batteries\u2014like radios and other compact devices. So, why go for high-tech batteries in small gear, and why silicon oxide and graphene? Could this be a compelling next-gen battery for the rest of us?\n\nWatch How the Next Big Solar Panel Tech is Already Here https://youtu.be/3GIzZwQw4nc?list=PLnTSM-ORSgi7uzySCXq8VXhodHB5B5OiQ\n\nVideo script and citations:\nhttps://undecidedmf.com/why-the-us-military-chose-silicon-graphene-batteries/\n\nGet my achieve energy security with solar guide: \nhttps://link.undecidedmf.com/solar-guide\n", "id": 1456839, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l60hjFvj64s", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 453, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCjtUS7-SZTi6pXjUbzGHQCg", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/l60hjFvj64s/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Why The US Military Chose Silicon-Graphene Batteries", "vote": 0}]
