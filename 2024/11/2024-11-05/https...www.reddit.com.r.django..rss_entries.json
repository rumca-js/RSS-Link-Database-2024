Model A has FK reference to B (Many-to-one relationship).</p> <p>I\u2019ve a UI built in react where I\u2019m showing users a list of model A. I also have a functionality where user can filter data based on model B(For this I\u2019ll need to call a list endpoint for Model B). I\u2019m currently using \u201cdrf-rest-permission\u201d to manage the permission, but in some cases, a user is thrown 403 when frontend calls model B list endpoint when user tries to filter on model A list (This happens when user has permission to access model A list but not model B list)</p> <p>My question is, how can I manage permission in this case? My model(Model B) is pretty crucial and is a FK reference in many models, so this kind of cases might arise for other models as well in the future. How can I make the permissions generic for model B so anyone wants to apply filtering would not be thrown 403?</p> <p>One solution I was thinking was to create a slim object of Model B(Sli", "id": 1454548, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/1gjyxhg/best_approach_to_allow_permission_for_certain", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 491, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/django/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Best approach to allow permission for certain models", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-11-05T03:06:54+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Are there any sources for making templates that can act like components? </p> <p>Sort of how react libraries have material where they have docs on how to use their \u201cselect\u201d widget</p> <p>Is there any source like that for Django otherwise I have to make my own custom stuff</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Sweet_Part_8168\"> /u/Sweet_Part_8168 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/1gjx43h/component_sources/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/1gjx43h/component_sources/\">[comments]</a></span>", "id": 1454139, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/1gjx43h/component_sources", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 491, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/django/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Component sources", "vote": 0}]
