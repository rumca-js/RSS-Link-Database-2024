<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am a beginner in hardware and am trying to run the Embench benchmark suite on ESP32 C6 (rv32). Embench does not have the board configuration files for this RISC-V board so I have to write it myself. I am trying to understand the configuration files for other boards, but I am too much of a beginner to understand it... How can I go ahead with this? What steps should I break this problem into? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SiciliousCaesar"> /u/SiciliousCaesar </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1gk5182/running_embench_on_a_riscv_esp32_c6_module/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1gk5182/running_embench_on_a_riscv_esp32_c6_module/">[comments]</a></span>
