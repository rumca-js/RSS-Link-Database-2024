<p><a href="https://kottke.org/24/11/the-powerful-density-of-hypertextual-writing">Jason Kottke, going meta on that one-paragraph hypertext editorial</a> from the NYT that <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/11/04/vote-to-end-the-trump-era-nyt-editorial-board">I linked to</a> yesterday:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What makes this piece so effective is its plain language and its
information density. This density is a real strength of hypertext
that is often overlooked and taken for granted. Only 110 words in
that paragraph but it contains 27 links to other NYT opinion
pieces published over the last several months that expand on each
linked statement or argument. If you were inclined to follow
these links, you could spend hours reading about how unfit Trump
is for office.</p>

<p>A simple list of headlines would have done the same basic job, but
by presenting it this way, the Times editorial board is
simultaneously able to deliver a strong opinion; each of those
links is like a

<p>We recently attended the <a href="https://blog.1password.com/rsa-2024-conference-takeaways/">RSA conference in San Francisco</a> — security’s biggest event of the year — and we were struck by how infatuated everyone was with the promise of new, shiny solutions to fix new, shiny problems. On some level that’s not surprising — tech is constantly driving toward the future, and security is one of the fastest-moving areas of tech.</p>

<p>But on the other hand, it seems like the security industry is walking away from some of its most foundational problems before they’ve actually been solved. People would rather talk about AI-powered behavioral analytics that can detect when a worker’s mouse is moving strangely than the decidedly un-glamorous work of rolling out patches and managing permissions.</p>

<p>This disconnect was especially clear in the 2024 Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR). This year’s report found that “the human element” (accidental breaches caused by human

<p>The New York Times editorial board, making deft use of good old-fashioned hypertext, has published a powerful endorsement on the eve of the election that covers so much ground, yet fits entirely in a single concise paragraph. In its entirety:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You already <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/07/18/opinion/trump-presidency-record.html">know</a> Donald Trump. He is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/07/11/opinion/editorials/donald-trump-2024-unfit.html">unfit</a> to lead. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/22/opinion/donald-trump-ezra-klein-podcast.html">Watch him</a>.

## The Message That Works: the Republicans Who Know Trump Best Refuse to Endorse Him

<p>Bill Kristol, writing last month for The Bulwark:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Democratic polling and messaging firm Blueprint <a href="https://blueprint2024.com/polling/trump-closing-argument-10-16/">recently
tested the effectiveness</a> of several closing messages for
the Harris campaign. (This was before Kelly’s new remarks.) Here’s
one message the group put before voters:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Donald Trump doesn’t have the character it takes to be president.
He’s erratic and can’t control himself. He denied the results of
an election just because he lost and is a threat to the
fundamental American principle of democracy. He instigated a riot
at the Capitol that left three police officers dead.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This general (and true) statement barely moved the needle on
voters’ preferences. It presumably simply sounds like a
reiteration of things voters have heard before.</p>

<p>What *did *move the needle was this message:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Nearly half of Donald Tru

## Harrison Ford Endorses Kamala Harris

<p>Harrison Ford:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The truth is this. Kamala Harris will protect your right to
<em>disagree</em> with her. About policies, or ideas. And then, as we
have done for centuries, we’ll debate them. We’ll work on them
together. And we’ll move forward. The other guy? He demands
unquestioning loyalty. Says he wants revenge.</p>

<p>I’m Harrison Ford, I’ve got one vote, same as everyone else — and I’m going to use it to move forward. I’m going to vote for
Kamala Harris.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ford’s message is a powerful framing of the authoritarian, anti-democracy dynamic in this election. Short, gruff, and to the point. Worth sharing to anyone you think might still be on the fence.</p>
