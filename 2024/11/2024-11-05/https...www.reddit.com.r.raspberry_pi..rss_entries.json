However, I&#39;d like to:</p> <ul> <li>continue to use the vga666 hat connected to my CRT </li> <li>Add the m.2 hat+ to add an ssd</li> <li>Add an audio hat since the pi5 no longer has a 3.5mm audio output.</li> </ul> <p>If i understand correctly, you can only stack hats if they&#39;re all hat+. Otherwise you can only have one hat+ and one hat? Is that true? So I can&#39;t use 3 hats? Unless I use an audio hat that is also hat+?</p> <p>Would I be able to use a combo hat+ with the vga666? So could I use the HatDrive! Piano for Raspberry Pi 5, which has both audio and m.2 and is a hat+?</p> <p>Thanks</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ogg1e\"> /u/ogg1e </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1gkfaf2/possible_to_have_rpi5_with_3_hats_m2_vga666_and/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ra", "id": 1460486, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1gkfaf2/possible_to_have_rpi5_with_3_hats_m2_vga666_and", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 470, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Possible to have RPI5 with 3 hats? m.2, vga666 and audio out?", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-11-05T14:51:38+00:00", "description": "<table> <tr><td> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1gk8g3i/spotted_at_cancun_airport/\"> <img src=\"https://preview.redd.it/bi7ehudfj3zd1.jpeg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=44eb77fb0b58d872c68d4058f0b953769e579966\" alt=\"Spotted at cancun airport\" title=\"Spotted at cancun airport\" /> </a> </td><td> <!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/navk11\"> /u/navk11 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://i.redd.it/bi7ehudfj3zd1.jpeg\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1gk8g3i/spotted_at_cancun_airport/\">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>", "id": 1457274, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1gk8g3i/spotted_at_cancun_airport", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 470, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://preview.redd.it/bi7ehudfj3zd1.jpeg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=44eb77fb0b58d872c68d4058f0b953769e579966", "title": "Spotted at cancun airport", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-11-05T14:43:54+00:00", "description": "<table> <tr><td> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1gk8a36/the_3v3_boostconverter_on_my_pico_blow_up_so_i/\"> <img src=\"https://preview.redd.it/3ruv3us1i3zd1.jpeg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9838531db79ae864db26b383c516817b670cf25a\" alt=\"The 3V3 Boost-Converter on my Pico blow up so I build one myself\" title=\"The 3V3 Boost-Converter on my Pico blow up so I build one myself\" /> </a> </td><td> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Hustenbonbon132\"> /u/Hustenbonbon132 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://i.redd.it/3ruv3us1i3zd1.jpeg\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1gk8a36/the_3v3_boostconverter_on_my_pico_blow_up_so_i/\">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>", "id": 1457275, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1gk8a36/the_3v3_boostconverter_on_my_pico_blow_up_so_i", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 470, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://preview.redd.it/3ruv3us1i3zd1.jpeg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=9838531db79ae864db26b383c516817b670cf25a", "title": "The 3V3 Boost-Converter on my Pico blow up so I build one myself", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-11-05T11:14:58+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I am currently running into lag issues with a Kingstone 3.0 220MB/s USB when using Ubuntu server 24.04 LTS.</p> <p>Bookworm works fine but I have always used Ubuntu and know my way around it but just now I have installed it using the pi imager and it won&#39;t even upgrade.
