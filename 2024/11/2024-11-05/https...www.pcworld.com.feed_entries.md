<p>SSDs, i.e. solid state drives, have completely changed the computing experience over the last decade. </p>



<p>These wondrous storage devices have sped up previously ponderous boot times to a point bordering instantaneous, vastly improved the responsiveness of programs and games, and generally made the copious long wait times we all used to suffer a thing of a past. If you’re not using an SSD, you should be, and if you have an older model, consider upgrading to the must faster speeds of newer models powered by cutting-edge PCIe 4.0 and 5.0 interfaces.</p>

<p>Another week, another issue with Windows 11 24H2 cropping up. It’s been over a month since the major Windows 11 update began rolling out to users and we’ve seen <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2505552/try-fixing-your-windows-11-24h2-network-issues-with-these-steps.html">network connectivity issues</a>, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2495860/microsoft-blocks-windows-11-24h2-update-on-devices-with-known-issues.html">blue screen crashes</a>, and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2502692/the-update-meant-to-rescue-windows-11-24h2-is-failing-to-install.html">rescue patches that fail to install</a>. It’s gotten to the point where Microsoft has had to block the update for affected devices.</p>

<p>What kind of gaming laptop can you get for $850? At best, maybe something with an RTX 4050 GPU and Intel Core i5 CPU — and that’s why this deal we’re highlighting today is <em>so freakin’ good</em>.</p>



<p>Right now, you can get <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/acer-nitro-v-anv15-51-789j-15-6-fhd-ips-laptop-13th-gen-intel-core-i7-nvidia-geforce-rtx-4060-16gb-ddr5-512gb-ssd-obsidian-black/6576934.p?skuId=6576934">this Acer Nitro V gaming laptop at Best Buy for just $850</a> — or 23 percent off its normal price of $1,100 — and this particular model is configured with a GeForce RTX 4060 graphics card and an Intel Core i7 processor.</p>



<p>Let’s start with that processor, which is more specifically an Intel Core i7-13620H with 10 cores. That’s powerful enough to handle most tasks at top performance, and it’s bolstered by 16GB of DDR5 RAM so you hav

<p>According to <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/microsoft-might-rebrand-its-ai-including-copilot-to-windows-intelligence-apples-strategy-fell-too-far-from-the-tree">Windows Central</a>, Microsoft might be looking to rebrand its collection of Windows AI capabilities under a new name.</p>



<p>A couple of weeks ago, <a href="https://x.com/teroalhonen/status/1847290774272045118">one Twitter user</a> was digging through the <code>AppPrivacy.adml</code> file in the latest version of Windows 11 and found references to something called “Windows Intelligence.” Specifically, a setting called “Let Apps Access Windows Intelligence.”</p>

## Create your own ultrawide setup with two of these $70 Dell monitors

<p>Ultrawide monitors are awesome, but they’re extremely expensive. If you’re on a tight budget, you could replicate a similar setup by putting together multiple monitors next to each other.</p>



<p>And right now, you can do that on the cheap with a couple of these <a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-22-monitor-se2225h/apd/210-bnhm/monitors-monitor-accessories">21.5-inch Dell SE monitors that are only $70 each</a>. Dell is currently selling them for $20 off, a nice discount of 22 percent.</p>



<p>The Dell SE2225H is a 21.5-inch monitor with a VA panel that delivers great color, good contrast ratios, and wide viewing angles. It has a standard 1080p resolution that serves well as a daily driver, and it also has an anti-glare coating to reduce eye strain. But with a refresh rate of 75Hz and a 5ms response time, don’t expect top-tier gaming here.</

## Amazon Kindle vs. Kindle Paperwhite: Should you pay more for your e-reader?

<p>An e-reader work wonders for bookworms struggling with library management. You don’t even have to spend that much either, as today’s entry-level options pack a ton of features. Case in point: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CNV9F72P">Amazon’s latest Kindle</a>, which just launched in mid-October. It offers a 300 ppi display, an improved front light, and audiobook playback.</p>



<p>Still, a higher-end model can bring material benefits. That’s especially so when comparing the basic Kindle against the more <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CFPJYX7P">luxe Kindle Paperwhite</a> (and its fancier <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CFPP8C33/">Paperwhite Signature Edition</a> variant), which also have been refreshed for 2024. A few key differences exist between the two models that can dramatically tip the scales in favor of one over the other, dependin

## Why you shouldn’t buy a laptop based purely on its specs

<p>When buying a laptop, we tend to think there’s no stronger indication about how it’s going to perform than its specs sheet. We put so much emphasis on it in our quest to find the fastest, most efficient, and graphically superior product to suit our needs.</p>



<p>But in doing so it’s easy to make a common blunder: To spend a lot of money on a laptop with specs that look great, only to have the device fail to live up to expectations.</p>



<p>I see it all the time in my role as a laptop reviewer. But what’s more, I often see big differences in performance among laptops with the same specs. So…why aren’t specs the best hint to performance? And how can you really tell if a laptop is going to perform well?</p>
