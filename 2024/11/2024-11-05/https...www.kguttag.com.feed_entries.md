I divided the two-hour AR Roundtable into three parts, with this being the last and, I think, in some ways, the most interesting part. We discussed more of the motivations for Meta and Snap announcing these concept products. Brad shared some information he has heard about issues with Meta's EMG wristband control, and Jeri shared some of her past experiences with EMG-type control.
