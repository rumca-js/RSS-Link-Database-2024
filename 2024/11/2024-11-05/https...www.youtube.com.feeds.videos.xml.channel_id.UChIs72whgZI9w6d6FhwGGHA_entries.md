We're investigating Intel's RL-ILM vs. Standard ILM on its new Arrow Lake CPUs, or the Core Ultra 200 lineup (Ultra 9 285K, Ultra 5 245K, and Ultra 7 265K). Intel has an optional "RL-ILM" (Reduced Load Independent Loading Mechanism) that appears to be present on most high-end boards right now; however, lower end boards will possibly have the cheaper "Standard ILM," which more closely mirrors previous Intel ILM solutions.
