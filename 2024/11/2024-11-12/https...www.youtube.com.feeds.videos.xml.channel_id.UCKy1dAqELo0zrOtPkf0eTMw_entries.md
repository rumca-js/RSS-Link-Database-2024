## Ubisoft Hit With Lawsuit for Shutting Down The Crew - IGN Daily Fix

In today's Daily Fix:
Ubisoft is being sued by a couple of California gamers in a class action lawsuit over the shutdown of The Crew. The game is a 2014 open-world racing game that required an internet connection to work, and now that Ubisoft pulled the plug on it, even physical copies no longer work. The two gamers filed the lawsuit, reasoning that the physical copies they purchased was the game itself, and not a license for the game, as is common with digital copies. The lawsuit comes ahead of a California law that will go into effect in 2025, which requires retailers to make it clear that when purchasing media like a game or movie, you're only buying a license, and not a copy of the media itself. In other news, Amazon's Secret Level anthology show will not pull its Concord segment, despite the game—and studio—being shuttered by Sony mere weeks after launch. Secret Level's Tim Miller praised developer Firewalk Studio, and admitted that there had been no discussion of shelving the C

## Dune: Prophecy Spoiler-Free Review

Dune: Prophecy episodes 1-4, reviewed by Tyler Robertson. Narrated by Erik Adams.

Dune: Prophecy’s depiction of a fledgling Bene Gesserit gives fans of later Dune novels a lot to chew on. Many of the more character-focused elements of its story are thrilling, and Jessica Barden, Emily Watson, Emma Canning, and Olivia Williams are superb as ancestors of House Harkonnen. But with a lack of cohesive vision, the prequel series fails to live up to the expectation of quality set by the books and films that preceded it.

After 20 years away Odysseus (Fiennes) washes up on the shores of Ithaca, haggard and unrecognizable. The King has finally returned home but much has changed in his kingdom since he left to fight in the Trojan war. His beloved wife Penelope (Binoche) is now a prisoner in her own home, hounded by her many ambitious suitors to choose a new husband, a new king. Their son Telemachus (Plummer), who has grown up fatherless, is facing death at the hands of the suitors who see him as an obstacle in their relentless pursuit of Penelope and the kingdom. Odysseus has changed too. Scarred by his experience of war, he is no longer the mighty warrior his people remember. But he is forced to face his past in order to rediscover the strength needed to save his family and win back the love he has lost.
