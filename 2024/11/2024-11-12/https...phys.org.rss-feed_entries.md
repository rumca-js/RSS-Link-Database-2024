Scientists at EMBL Grenoble and the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) have developed a new method for using in situ serial crystallography (iSX) to study the structure of macromolecules. They recently described this new technique in a paper published in the journal IUCrJ. The method is now operational at the ID23-2 beamline, jointly operated by EMBL and the ESRF.

Apple trees, like many perennial plants, endure a prolonged juvenile stage before reaching maturity, during which they experience complex developmental changes. These transitions impact photosynthetic traits, growth rates, and hormone balance. However, the mechanisms governing these processes are not well understood, complicating efforts to enhance fruit tree productivity.

It's still one of the coolest things I ever saw. I was in the U.S. Air Force in the 90s, and November 1998 saw me deployed to the dark skies of Kuwait. That trip provided an unexpected treat, as the Leonid meteors hit dramatic storm levels on the morning of the 17th. Meteors came fast and furious towards local sunrise, often lighting up the desert floor like celestial photoflashes in the sky.

Few plant families are as iconic as the resilient, spiky cactus, thriving in the driest deserts and as well as decorating our offices and homes. Their success in both environments comes down to extreme adaptations for surviving with little water—whether braving the brutal sun or enduring weeks of neglect from busy "plant parents". But there's much more to the around 1,850 cacti species than their ruggedness. Here are six surprising facts about this succulent plant family that you may not know.

A Southwest Research Institute-led team combined compositional data of primitive bodies like Kuiper Belt objects, asteroids and comets with new solar data sets to develop a revised solar composition that potentially reconciles spectroscopy and helioseismology measurements for the first time. Helioseismology probes the sun's interior by analyzing the waves that travel through it, while spectroscopy reveals the surface composition based on the spectral signature produced by each chemical element.

The chloroplast protein transport system includes a motor protein complex, which plays a critical driving role in the translocation of precursor proteins across the chloroplast membrane.

Inside cells, there exists an extensive system of canals known as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which consists of membrane-encased tubes that are partially broken down as needed—for instance in case of a nutrient deficiency. As part of this process, bulges or protrusions form in the membrane, which then pinch off and are recycled by the cell.
