I can usually get only like one person to play with so i like the fact its just 1v1 but the thing is i dont know if i should get the default or the clone wars edition. I have watched some videos and I understand its basically the same thing but I am kinda confused about the exile cards and exile pile. How exactly does this work and what are the differences between the two editions.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/AverageCartiEnjoyer"> /u/AverageCartiEnjoyer </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1gpwtzl/star_wars_deck_building_game/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1gpwtzl/star_wars_deck_building_game/">[comments]</a></span>

I once played a massive game in a hall (like 30-40 people), where we all got taken to one of 4 teams with hidden cards, like Mafia.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’ve played about a dozen games of the new Mistborn deckbuilder from Beotherwise Games and I think it rises above the genre pretty well. I’m a huge Cosmere fan and I’ve played most of the popular deck builders as well as the deck builder-by-proxy games like Quacks.</p> <p>Pros: The metals and the ability to flare/recover them to power your played cards is a wholly unique mechanic and the individual Mistborn are different enough that you kind of feel like you have to start over with learning what’s effective and what falls flat. There’s a lot of variation and definitely no single path feels optimal.</p> <p>Thematically, the solo and co-op versions of the game are really great. The Lord Ruler as an opponent is frustrating, nearly-immune and feels like an insurmountable challenge. Out of 8 attempts we only managed to get him once. And that was because he killed the weaker, mission-focused players and let our heavy-hitter/healer Mistborn lay into him qui

Also, if I have a weapon with an attack that can do either yellow or red damage, can I pick the color of damage that I want it to do?</p> <p>Second:</p> <p>If I am playing with someone and we are both fighting a creature(s), when the cre

This dungeon crawler, designed for 1 to 4 players, lets you take on the role of a legendary hero who must save Everterna from an Abyssal invasion. The funding goal has already been reached, and new stretch goals are unlocking more heroes, enemies, items, and even the possibility of miniatures.

Being captain and reaching deep space is worth the same 7 points as having majority on the planet three spaces below. Not only that but the moon below that planet is worth 4 points.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I need a coop game, and while the first candidate was Cthulu DMD, Spirit Island got my attention since it seems to be an absolute fantastic coop game with my favourite type of mechanic: characters improvement through new habilites.</p> <p>However, It seems to have a great flaw for my group: the difficulty. I manage to teach them Dune Uprising but It was hellish (we have a blast after that thought, excelent game), and Spirit Island seems to be much harder to learn. Honestly, I dont want to buy this game only to give it up because we cant manage to learn it without having a video or reading the instructions frecuently, so, what do you think?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/icaromhb"> /u/icaromhb </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1gp9a26/is_spirit_island_difficulty_to_learn_an_obstacle/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/c

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Background: Im a solo gamer. Causal at best. </p> <p>what im looking for: same mechanics, but alitte more &quot;balanced&quot; as the point system just seems off at times. Also solo. </p> <p>My pros of takenoko: - love the tile placement as the &quot;world builds as time goes on&quot; - strategy of resource management and character placement</p> <p>My cons: - when I play solo I &quot;know&quot; what is goinf to happen. I just try to beat a particular strategy &quot;all bamboo&quot; &quot;all farmer&quot; &quot;mix of all&quot; - the point scoring can get &quot;unbalanced&quot; at times (please save breath on trying to explain how it is balanced, or when one goes one strategy, I can counter woth another strategy.) </p> <p>So my question... love takenoko.
