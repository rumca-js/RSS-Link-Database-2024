It&#39;s really upsetting to hear this kind of ignorance and hate toward gaming and hacking communities.</p> <p><strong>Title:</strong> XP points to level up: Gaming as a ‘gateway’ activity to cybercrime. </p> <p><strong>Speaker:</strong><br/> Yanna Papadodimitraki, Cambridge Cybercrime Centre, Dept of Computer Science and Technology, University of Cambridge </p> <p><strong>When:</strong> Nov. 14, 2024, 2:00-4:00 pm PST </p> <p><strong>Where:</strong> International Computer Science Institute, 2150 Shattuck Ave, Suite 250, Berkeley, (in the SkyDeck Building next to the Downtown Berkeley BART station) </p> <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Law enforcement in the UK (and the EU) often cite gaming as a ‘gateway’ activity to cybercrime, especially for young people and hackers. This follows the hypothesis of a linear progression from gaming to cybercrime, based on the gateway drug theory. Drawing from interview
