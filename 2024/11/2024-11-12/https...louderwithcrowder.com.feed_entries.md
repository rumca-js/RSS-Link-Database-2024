	Donald Trump has chosen South Dakota's smokeshow of a Governor Kristi Noem to head up Homeland Security. Or, he is rumored to be about to choose her. I'll be honest: the media coverage is starting to confuse me. I'm still not sure if Marco Rubio is secretary of state or not. But, as far as X-Twitter trends go, it's Noem to DHS. That's good enough for me.</p><p>Noem was rumored to be on the VP shortlist, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/sources-may-6th-2024" target="_blank">but then that whole "killing a dog</a><a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/sources-may-6th-2024" target="_blank">" thing happened</a>. It will no doubt come up during her confirmation hearing from a Democrat senator looking for TV time—my guess is Cory Booker. Hopefully, it gets countered with a mention of the time she went all ham on a bunch of Amazo

But the way things stand down, it's Rubio.</p><p>I know I'm expected to be "BOO, RINO, BAD," but Rubio was the first official I connected with, back when get was Florida's Speaker of the House and had "100 Innovative Ideas...," and was a keynote at the first CPAC I went to in 2009. The senator has also been stellar this year combating the media as an outspoken advocate for Trump and Trump's agenda. I think he's a good pick</p><p>For a taste of what Secretary Rubio looks like being diplomatic, take you back to November 2023 and the return of Code Pink. They were no
