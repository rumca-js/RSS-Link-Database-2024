At the Open Source Summit in Vienna, Austria, Arpit Joshipura, GM of Networking, Edge, and IoT at the Linux Foundation, joined us to talk about key announcements made at the event and shared insights on the current state of open source in the telco space.
Joshipura outlined three major announcements: the CAMARA project reaching a significant milestone with the release of its first major version, the “Meta-Release Fall 2024”, a joint venture led by Ericsson and 13 other telcos, and the move of free5GC to the Linux Foundation to bolster open-source 5G network development.
Joshipura said that the foundation is focusing on domain-specific AI to enhance network performance and security, with projects like Thoth anonymizing data for training models without compromising privacy. Additionally, Joshipura discussed the shifting dynamics in the telco industry, emphasizing the importance of open source in addressing various access methods and the need to harmonize edge and core frameworks.
