<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Just put on Dragon Ball Super: Broly and it&#39;s subtitles rather than dubbed. Dragon Ball in the summer, then Z and Super recently were all my first animes as I&#39;d never seen any before and watched them all dubbed. I have so many other anime on my list. Just wondered, do you guys watch dubbed, subbed or a mix of both? With foreign series like Squid Game or Narcos etc, I watched subbed as it&#39;s humans speaking and I like to hear the original language. 😂</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/HC3096"> /u/HC3096 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1gpr5l8/dubbed_or_subbed_viewing/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1gpr5l8/dubbed_or_subbed_viewing/">[comments]</a></span>

## Do you think that Code Geass still holds up well or is it just nostalgia?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Within the anime fandom Code Geass is very well regarded as one of the greatest anime of all time or it&#39;s just highly appreciated but i also see a lot of people that after watching other anime (especially ones that are similar and more complex like Gundam and LOGH) end up coming back to Code Geass and not finding it as good or even claiming that it&#39;s actually bad and the only reason people still regard it so well it&#39;s because they watched it when they were younger and because of the ending, not to count many plot holes and weird decisions like The Massacre™ .</p> <p>So what you think of Code Geass watching it nowadays? Especially if you watched it when you were younger and rewatched it older.</p> <p>Edit: Added criticism - Most of the cast isn&#39;t half as good as Lelouch and most of them aren&#39;t that well executed or interesting, Suzaku is supposed to be the counterpoint to Lelouch but he&#39;s way too unlikeable and the main villain
