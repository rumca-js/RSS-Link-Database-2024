Since I already have a microsoft office family plan I get 5tb of storage. Cost wise, switching over to OneDrive and mounting it using rclone for my immich storage makes complete sense.</p> <p>However, I&#39;m trying to find out if there are any drawbacks because if I were to switch over to OneDrive I&#39;d have to transfer over 500GB of data. Has anyone used OneDrive for this use case and what was your experience?</p> <p>Also if I were to decide on using OneDrive, what would be the most painless way on transferring those 500GBs of data?</p> <p>Any help would be appreciated.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/borkode\"> /u/borkode </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1gpr8e3/hetzner_storage_box_or_onedrive_w_rclone/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com", "id": 1502143, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1gpr8e3/hetzner_storage_box_or_onedrive_w_rclone", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 450, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Hetzner storage box or OneDrive w/ rclone", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-11-12T17:43:08+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>just out of curiosity.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/poll/1gpqijh\">View Poll</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/More_Butterscotch678\"> /u/More_Butterscotch678 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1gpqijh/how_do_you_mainly_protect_your_selfhosted_services/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1gpqijh/how_do_you_mainly_protect_your_selfhosted_services/\">[comments]</a></span>", "id": 1501628, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1gpqijh/how_do_you_mainly_protect_your_selfhosted_services", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 450, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "How do you (mainly) protect your selfhosted services?", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-11-12T17:38:20+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hey everyone, first time using Traefik.

On my Windows computers, I want to have an agent where file are sync either ondemand or always so I have access to the file when I need it (think google drive).</p> <p>On android, I want an app that allow me to browse from anywhere my library, open a file in a dedicated app (excel for instance), edit the file and then save it right back in the &quot;cloud&quot;.</p> <p>I saw nextcloud, way overkill and too clunky. I just need the file storage part. I already have immich for my video and photo, it&#39;s really to replace my google drive / dropbox.</p> <p>Thank you!</p> <p>edit: bonus point if I can use it securely without VPN and extra point for multi-user support (not needed but never know in the future)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/u", "id": 1497644, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1gpbvft/dropbox_selfhosted_alternative", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 450, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "dropbox selfhosted alternative?", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-11-12T02:22:28+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hey all, so I&#39;m setting up SSL for my hosted apps locally, using DNS-01 challenges with Cloudflare and Nginx.
