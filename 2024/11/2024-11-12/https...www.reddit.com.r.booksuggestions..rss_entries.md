I have enjoyed it, but also there have been parts where I felt like I would quit the series. </p> <p>Things I liked -</p> <p>The magic system was very interesting and pretty pad out over the course of the 14 books. </p> <p>There was a good progression of the main characters becoming more powerful etc. </p> <p>I think the Forsaken where a very cool enemy. </p> <p>Things I didn&#39;t like - </p> <p>I think this tends to be a pretty big problem in fantasy. but imo the books at some points are intensely sexist, and this was almost a deal breaker for me. The way the writer views women is uncomfortable, and his view on heterosexual relationships is incredibly childish. </p> <p>So with that being said, could anyone recommend potentially a more nuanced fantasy series that is less misogynistic? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/W

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have recently gotten back into reading. The reason why I stopped is because every time I start a book, if it’s good I become sort of obsessed and have to finish it within 2-3 days. That’s why I usually stick to stand alones. Then I enter a sort of reading slump where I feel like I’ll never find a book that’s as good. That’s why maybe I need to go back to reading series because a stand alone book isn’t enough time for me to get proper closure and what not. If I feel like there’s a lot ahead for me to read, maybe I wouldn’t be as rushed to finish it. Some series I have enjoyed: ACOTAR, cruel prince, storm and silence. Some stand alones I have recently enjoyed: calling on the matchmaker, the wall of Winnipeg and me, the duchess deal, the governess game. </p> <p>I generally like reading romance, been into historical romance lately (Tessa dare). Don’t mind some fantasy recs (beginner friendly) as well! </p> <p>Anyone have any book series to recommend? M
