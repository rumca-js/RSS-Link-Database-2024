<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>For Christmas A close friend and I are annotating our favourite books and then trading them. My question is what is the best method to annotate a book? There isn’t enough space to write in the actual book so should I just use post it notes or do I go all out and write a reference sheet? I’m worried about making it too clunky to enjoy if they have to keep looking over at a reference sheet. I can’t use an ebook so that idea is also out</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Hurikane92"> /u/Hurikane92 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gpxrh5/what_is_the_best_method_for_annotating_books/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gpxrh5/what_is_the_best_method_for_annotating_books/">[comments]</a></span>

Historical fiction, general fiction, sci-fi, fantasy, educational and science books.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Sorry this is not a super in/depth post or anything, but I just met Jenny Agutter who plays Bobby in the 1970 film of The Railway Children- super nice human and it’s just bought a tonne of childhood memories flooding back about how great the book was, how much it inspired me to love trains to this day, and what a great escapism it was. I listened to the audiobook on repeat and loved how trains be and characters in the story. I also went on to work with people affected by imprisonment of a family member, and I always wonder if it was this book that planted the seed of why that matters. </p> <p>Anyway, I just needed the Redditsphere to know this because it made me super happy but nobody I mentioned it to irl has read the book, and I know they’ll be other people here who love it as much as I do. Share your love for the book! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/BeeTheGoddess"> /u/BeeTheGoddess </a> <br/
