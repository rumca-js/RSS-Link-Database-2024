Both texts for beginners that go into the topics properly and manuals for people with a certain level of knowledge already would be fine (in the course we didn&#39;t discussed all the topics, so I have knowledge in some of them, while in others I don&#39;t have a deep knowledge).</p> <p>Thank you all very muchðŸ˜Š</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/DaveG98"> /u/DaveG98 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking_Tutorials/comments/1gpg6cc/textbooks_eth
