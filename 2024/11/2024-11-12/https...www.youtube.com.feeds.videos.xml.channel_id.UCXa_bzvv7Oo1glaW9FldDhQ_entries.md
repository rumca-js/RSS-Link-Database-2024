Just because a game offers up a large open space to explore, doesn’t mean you can do much in it. Games are more than their size, and these 10 games offer a vast breadth of activities to engage with the world, no matter how big. Of particular note are the 100s of controllable NPCs within Watch Dogs Legion’s London map, which gets even more fun when playing with friends. 

Mods also help elevate an open world game to new heights with creative new modes and features. Skyrim’s Enderal mod contains a 100 hour story with new characters and locations, extending Skyrim’s lifespan and usability extensively. Whether or not you enjoy exploring, crafting, or fighting, these 10 open world games allow you to tailor the experience how you want.
