When active filaments are exposed to localized illumination, they accumulate into stable structures along the boundaries of the illuminated area. Based on this fact, researchers developed a model that can be used to simulate the self-organization of thread-like living matter. This model provides important insights for potential technical applications in the formation of structures.

## 'Moonlighting' enzymes can lead to new cancer therapies

Researchers reveal that metabolic enzymes known for their roles in energy production and nucleotide synthesis are taking on unexpected 'second jobs' within the nucleus, orchestrating critical functions like cell division and DNA repair. The discovery not only challenges longstanding biological paradigms in cellular biology but also opens new avenues for cancer therapies, particularly against aggressive tumours like triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).

## One genomic test can diagnose nearly any infection

Researchers have identified a potential biomarker of Parkinson's disease progression. According to the new study, patients with a slow progression of the pathology would have a significant increase in the levels of a molecule called ecto-GPR37 in the cerebrospinal fluid.

## Astronomers' theory of how galaxies formed may be upended

The standard model for how galaxies formed in the early universe predicted that the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) would see dim signals from small, primitive galaxies. But data are not confirming the popular hypothesis that invisible dark matter helped the earliest stars and galaxies clump together.

## First amber find on the Antarctic continent

Roughly 90 million years ago, climatic conditions in Antarctica were suitable for resin-producing trees. Researchers have now made the southernmost discovery of amber in the world.

## DNA packaging directly affects how fast DNA is copied in cells
 - [https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/11/241112122724.htm](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/11/241112122724.htm)

Researchers have found that the way DNA is packaged in cells can directly impact how fast DNA itself is copied during cell division. They discovered that DNA packaging sends signals through an unusual pathway, affecting the cell's ability to divide and grow. This opens up new doors to study how the copying of the DNA and its packaging are linked. These findings may help scientists to find therapies and medicines for diseases such as cancer in the future.
