I have enjoyed it, but also there have been parts where I felt like I would quit the series. </p> <p>Things I liked -</p> <p>The magic system was very interesting and pretty pad out over the course of the 14 books. </p> <p>There was a good progression of the main characters becoming more powerful etc. </p> <p>I think the Forsaken where a very cool enemy. </p> <p>Things I didn&#39;t like - </p> <p>I think this tends to be a pretty big problem in fantasy. but imo the books at some points are intensely sexist, and this was almost a deal breaker for me. The way the writer views women is uncomfortable, and his view on heterosexual relationships is incredibly childish. </p> <p>So with that being said, could anyone recommend potentially a more nuanced fantasy series that is less misogynistic? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/W", "id": 1498858, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1gphhru/recommendations_for_after_the_wheel_of_time", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 532, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Recommendations for after the Wheel of TIme?", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-11-12T09:54:15+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I have to choose a book to read for English class, but I&#39;m having a hard time to choose between these two.
