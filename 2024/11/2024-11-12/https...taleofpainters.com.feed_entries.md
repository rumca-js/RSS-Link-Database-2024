<p>Astorath has a grim task, it falls to him to take his brothers' lives when they have been lost to the Black Rage and have no semblance of control. It is not uncommon for Astorath to best his fallen battle brother in combat before he can bring his executioner's axe down on them. On today's blog post, I'll share pictures of my finished Astorath and I'll give you a top tip for painting him too. </p>
