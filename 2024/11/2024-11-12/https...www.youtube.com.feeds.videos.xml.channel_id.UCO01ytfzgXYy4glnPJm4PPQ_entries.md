Today on the Matt Walsh Show, according to exit polling data, the issue that may have ultimately swung the election was not the economy or immigration, but the trans issue. Swing voters were most concerned about putting a stop to Kamala's radical trans agenda. Also, the FEMA official who was fired for telling her team to skip homes with Trump signs is now speaking out. She says FEMA is lying: this was not an isolated incident. And today in our Daily Cancelation, I am tragically forced to cancel the Daily Wire's own Ben Shapiro. He has left me no choice.
