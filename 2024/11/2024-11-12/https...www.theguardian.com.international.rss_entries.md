<p>We take a look at every Liverpool game officiated by the referee who has been suspended for a foul-mouthed video tirade against Jürgen Klopp </p><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jul/11/liverpool-burnley-premier-league-match-report">Liverpool 1-1 Burnley</a> (11 July 2020):</strong> The game Coote references in his unbelievably stupid video. In his first time refereeing a Liverpool match, Coote rejects Andy Robertson’s claim for an 83rd-minute penalty when caught by Jóhann Gudmundsson. Robertson, clearly audible on camera with the game played behind closed doors during lockdown, labels the decision a disgrace. “What’s the point in having you?” he adds. Jürgen Klopp confronts the referee after the final whistle to complain that his goalkeeper Alisson was not afforded enough protection. The Liverpool manager said: “We were angry with the referee but we have to criticise ourselves first for not finishing the game.” The draw ends the newly crowned champions

He made the admission during a closed briefing to Israeli journalists last Tuesday regarding the army’s activities in the north of the strip. Israel’s forces, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/06/palestinians-will-not-be-allowed-to-return-to-homes-in-northern-gaza-says-idf">he boasted</a>, were getting closer to the “complete evacuation” of Jabaliya, Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahiya – Gaza’s three northernmost cities, which have been under intense Israeli bombardment since early October. “There is no intention of allowing the residents of the northern Gaza Strip to ret

<p>Just because Trump is publicly distancing himself from abortion does not mean Republicans won’t enact a national ban</p><p>Abortion rights initiatives were on the ballot in 10 states on Tuesday, and won in seven of them. One of the losers was prop 4, Florida’s abortion rights measure, which received a whopping 57% of the vote but failed to meet the state’s unusually high 60% threshold, meaning that the state’s six-week ban will remain in place. Asked about the Florida abortion rights proposition ahead of the election, Trump said that when he went to cast his ballot near Palm Beach, he would vote against it.</p><p>It has always been a little hard to believe that Donald Trump personally hates abortion, even if it is abundantly clear how little he thinks of women. Trump, after all, has claimed to have numerous conflicting positions on abortion rights throughout his life. And his brand of masculinity is boorish, vulgar, and above all, sexually entitled – far from the priggish, repress

<p>His house was bombed and his relatives killed, before he escaped to the US. Now he is on a relentless, restless drive to tell the stories of all those left behind</p><p>This time last year, Mosab Abu Toha was standing in a queue waiting to pass a checkpoint. He had already made the difficult decision to tell his parents that he and his wife, Maram, were leaving Gaza with their three young children; the checkpoint was on the road to the Rafah crossing into Egypt. He greeted people he recognised, tried to reassure his children. And then he was called out of the queue. “The young man with the black backpack who is carrying a red-haired boy. Put the boy down and come my way.”</p><p>Abu Toha was born in Gaza and had lived there for most of his 31 years, frequently under Israeli bombardment, but this was the first time he had encountered Israeli soldiers in person. He was ordered, by megaphone, to strip naked. When dressed again he was blindfolded, and a numbered bracelet attached to hi

<p>In evading legal consequences for his actions, Trump was handed a chillingly simple strategy: just run for president again</p><p>Donald Trump’s most vital campaign did not involve his political consultants, the hysteria of his rallies, the paranoid TV spots about migrant murderers and transgender bogeymen, his blathering on “bro” podcasts or the prancing of a hopped-up Elon Musk. Nor was it about a garbage can in the ocean, eating pets or divine intervention.</p><p>Trump’s vulnerability was always at the forefront of his mind. He knew he could have been eliminated at crucial moments before election day. He was anxious about more than an assassination. He understood that his most threatening adversary was the criminal justice system. Trump had to get away with his crimes to survive. The making of the president required the unmaking of justice.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/12/trump-criminal-charges-avoid-office">Continue reading...</a>

<p>An irascible priest loses his patience with a newcomer to Hong Kong’s funeral traditions in punchy melodrama of a film</p><p>Starting out as a prickly comedy in which wedding planner Dominic (Hong Kong standup icon Dayo Wong) switches to the funeral business, The Last Dance takes a sudden sombre turn. Dominic lands a seemingly unhinged client, turned down by all his competitors, who wants him to embalm her young son. As a string of putrefied matter hangs from the boy’s back while he is dressing him, Dominic realises he has already been dead for six months. It’s not the only mortician scene – and not the only note of unsettling realism with which writer-director Anselm Chan ballasts this well-constructed and punchy melodrama.</p><p>Bequeathed the funeral agent gig by his girlfriend’s retiring uncle, Dominic must get to grips with his new business partner: ball-breaking Taoist priest Master Man (Michael Hui), who performs the “breaking hell’s gate” rites that liberate departing soul

<p>The end to this bloody stalemate must come with negotiation, and Putin should not wait until Trump is in the White House</p><p>First the good news. The US is talking to Russia. Then the bad. Vladimir Putin has been phoned not by the current US president, but by a known admirer and sceptic of the US’s support for Ukraine, the president-elect, Donald Trump. Could these two facts offer a path to peace?</p><p>Two years ago, Putin made a terrible mistake. He thought he could invade Ukraine and topple its leader, Volodymyr Zelenskyy. He failed utterly. Ukraine’s forces pushed him back to the supposedly pro-Russian territory of his 2014 invasion. At talks in Istanbul months after this failure, Putin’s representatives might have settled for a ceasefire and the acceptance of some western security guarantee for Kyiv. The talks broke down with the west encouraging Ukraine to fight on. In what amounted to a proxy war on Moscow, the west attacked Russia and its people with the severest sanctio

A memoirist called Brian is recalling a mesmerisingly beautiful young woman he encountered as a student at Cambridge. “‘I heard her described variously as ‘elfin’, as ‘eldritch’,” he tells us, adding that “eldritch” is the word used by a minor character in the book, Tommy Cope, who is “always reaching for the slightly more recondite adjective”.

Since Abram Kameraz had begun to commute by train from Leningrad (now St Petersburg) to the suburban town of Pavlovsk earlier in the summer of 1941, attacks by enemy planes had become a frequent cause of delay. Through the carriage window, Kameraz saw the road was littered with bodies. These men, women and children had been killed by German planes which had strafed and bombed the crowds of refugees as they fled towards the city.

<p>After dismissing his defence minister, Yoav Gallant – and with Trump back in the White House – Benjamin Netanyahu’s position is stronger than ever. <strong>Julian Borger </strong>reports</p><p>It should have been a difficult week for the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. He started the week facing widescale protests against his leadership once more – this time after sacking his popular defence minister, Yoav Gallant.</p><p>Seen as the last independent figure in Netanyahu’s coalition, Gallant challenged the prime minister’s war goals and was seen as relatively moderate thanks to his wish to prioritise a hostage deal. When Netanyahu tried to dismiss him in the past he had to back down after demonstrators took to the street in huge numbers. This time, however, the prime minister successfully managed to oust his rival – and the final dissenting voice in his cabinet.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2024/nov/12/a-week-of-tumult-and-triumph-for-netanyahu-pod
