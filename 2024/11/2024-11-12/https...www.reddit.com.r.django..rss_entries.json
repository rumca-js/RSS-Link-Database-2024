I need to build a Python script that continuously (24/7) manages and interacts with users.

What are your favorite features of Django? I\u2019m currently really liking Django Admin. I like the batteries included approach. I\u2019m also glad to be out of pom.xml hell. While virtual environments are a bit annoying it\u2019s overall easier to grok what\u2019s going on with Python. I\u2019m also impressed by Bulma. I like that I don\u2019t have to use JavaScript to build a functioning UI. Something I still get a bit confused about is how to separate things out into apps. It\u2019s tempting to just keep everything in one app as one big monolith.
