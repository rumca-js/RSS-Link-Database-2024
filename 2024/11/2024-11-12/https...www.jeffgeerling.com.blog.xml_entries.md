            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>I had to pause some of my work getting <a href="https://github.com/geerlingguy/raspberry-pi-pcie-devices/issues/680">a current-gen AMD graphics card running on the Pi 5</a> and <a href="https://github.com/geerlingguy/sbc-reviews/issues/52">testing a 192-core AmpereOne server</a> to quickly post on the M4's efficiency.</p>
