<p>Here’s the Apple support page <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/iphone-models-compatible-with-ios-18-iphe3fa5df43/ios">listing the devices compatible with iOS 18</a>. They’re listed in chronological order, oldest to newest, and the list begins with the iPhone XR and iPhone XS from 2018. But on this support page, Apple styles the “R” and “S” suffixes as small caps.

<p>Apple Newsroom:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple has introduced Share Item Location, a new iOS feature that
helps users locate and recover misplaced items by easily and
securely sharing the location of an AirTag or Find My network
accessory with third parties such as airlines. Share Item Location
is available now in most regions worldwide as part of the public
beta of iOS 18.2, which will soon be available to all users as a
free software update for iPhone Xs and later. Find My is built
with privacy and safety at its core. The shared location will be
disabled as soon as a user is reunited with their item, can be
stopped by the owner at any time, and will automatically expire
after seven days. [...]</p>

<p>Users can generate a Share Item Location link in the Find My app
on their iPhone, iPad, or Mac. Recipients of a link will be able
to view a website that shows a location of the item on an
interactive map. The website will automatically update when a new
location is available and wil

## iOS 18.2 Beta 3 Adds New ‘Require Screen On’ Toggle for Camera Control

<p>Chance Miller, 9to5Mac:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/11/11/ios-18-2-beta-3-now-available-to-developers/">iOS 18.2 beta 3</a> adds another new toggle for
personalizing the iPhone 16’s Camera Control. Now, you can open
the Camera app with a single press of the Camera Control even if
your display is off.</p>

<p>If your iPhone 16’s display is off, the default behavior is that
you press the Camera Control once to wake the screen and again to
open the Camera app. This new toggle in iOS 18 gives you the
ability to remove that first press.</p>

<p>If you go to the Settings app and choose “Display and Brightness,”
you’ll see a new “Require Screen On” toggle at the bottom. This
toggle is enabled by default. If you <em>disable</em> this toggle,
however, a single press of the Camera Control will automatically
open the Camera app regardless of whether or not your iPhone 16’s
screen is on.</p>

<p>John Geleynse, Apple’s longtime head of developer evangelism, on LinkedIn:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Doing anything for 25 years is a pretty big deal. Being a part of
Apple for 25 years has been the privilege and experience of a
lifetime.</p>

<p>My last day at Apple was exactly a week ago today. I’d always
dreamed of being a part of Apple but never imagined it would be a
reality. The most productive and exciting years of my career have
been with Apple, and I’ll be forever grateful for the opportunity
to meet and work with thousands of creative and passionate
developers, designers, and students worldwide. [...]</p>

<p>There are no words to describe how grateful I am for the
opportunity to work side-by-side with so many great people at
Apple. Apple is an immensely special place — far greater than the
sum of its parts. Together, we did a lot.</p>

<p>I heard about Geleynse’s retirement through the grapevine a month or two ago. I was hoping he’d post something like this 

## Testing the New Ultrawide Mac Virtual Display Option in VisionOS 2.2

<p>MacRumors:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With the wide display option, there’s enough screen real estate to
use four apps at once without compromising on window size.
Ultrawide bumps up the available space even more, and it’s almost
too much display space.</p>

<p>Using the ultrawide setting is like having multiple curved Mac
displays in front of you to handle your Mac apps, and then you can
also add in visionOS apps to better utilize the virtual space
around you. The larger screen sizes for the Mac do improve
productivity because there’s so much more space to work with.</p>

<p>Note that you still can’t use multiple Mac windows when mirroring
your Mac display to your Vision Pro, but the wide and ultrawide
provide so much space that it’s essentially the same function.
Apple says that the ultrawide mode is equivalent to using two 4K
monitors side by side.</p>
