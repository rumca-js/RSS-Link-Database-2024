<p>Standing desks have been trendy for over a decade, due in large part to their claims of increased health for those of us who use a computer for hours every day. A new study with years of data and tens of thousands of participants throws cold water on those claims, suggesting that standing desks aren’t helping with some core health problems.</p>



<p>In the <a href="https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/53/6/dyae136/7822310">December 2024 issue of the International Journal of Epidemiology</a>, a team of researchers published a study with data from over 83,000 participants in the United Kingdom who had mixed both sitting and standing for work. They found that “stationary time” increased circulatory system disease risk.</p>

<p>Early Black Friday deals may actually be more enticing than what we’ll eventually see come the end of the month. Case in point, it’s hard to believe there’s going to be a better deal for the 1TB Samsung 990 EVO SSD than the one we’re seeing right now.</p>



<p>If you act fast, you can <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Internal-Computer-MZ-V9E1T0B-AM/dp/B0CRCC9863/">snag one for just $70 on Amazon</a>, which is a hefty 53 percent off its normal $150 price. That’s an <em>insanely good</em> deal for one of the best internal SSDs we’ve tested so far.</p>



<p>When our expert <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2214459/samsung-990-evo-review.html">reviewed the Samsung 990 EVO</a>, he enjoyed it enough to give it a 4-star rating, appreciating the drive’s fast overall performance, the five-year warranty, and that it works both on PCIe 5.0 and PCIe 4

<p>A Wi-Fi-connected security camera is an easy and technologically simple way to watch your home and give yourself a little peace of mind… or maybe you just like knowing the moment your Amazon packages arrive. Honestly, it’s mostly the second thing.</p>



<p>But while Wi-Fi security cameras are meant to equip homeowners and apartment dwellers with burglar-deterring measures, thieves are now using tech to even the playing field.</p>



<p>According to a tweet sent out by the <a href="https://x.com/LAPDWilshire/status/1764780841996030209/photo/1">Los Angeles Police Department’s Wilshire division</a> earlier this year (spotted by <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/networking/lapd-warn-residents-after-spate-of-wi-fi-jammer-cloaked-burglaries-police-share-a-security-check-list">Tom’s Hardware</a>), a small band of burglars is using Wi-Fi jamming devices to n

<p><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2025795/liquid-metal-vs-thermal-paste-which-is-better.html">“Liquid metal” thermal paste</a>, which replaces the usual chemical compound with a metallic alloy, can increase the thermal conductivity between your CPU and cooler. That’s why it’s popular with overclockers and other dedicated PC modders. But it comes with a healthy dose of risk, and Intel isn’t keen to take any more of it.</p>

<p>Users of three older Microsoft apps will soon have to get ready for a changeover.

<p>The classic Outlook app is also on track to being deprecated, but on a longer timeline. In recent months, Microsoft has repeatedly issued pop-ups informing users that they should switch to the new Outlook, but it wasn’t clear how long the grace period would be for those who weren’t ready to make the switch. Now there’s finally some clarity.</p>

<p>Nvidia has been trying all year to get its users onto the beta version of the Nvidia App, its new omnibus app for drivers, settings, and promos. This move might finally do it, though: the Nvidia App is now out of beta and ready to retire its predecessor.</p>



<p>While GeForce Experience will still work if you have it installed, it’s no longer being bundled with Nvidia’s frequent GPU updates, and it probably won’t be long before the program is put out to pasture.</p>

<p>Thunderbolt 5. The cutting edge of I/O. All of it — monitors, a Thunderbolt 5 dock, and even a Thunderbolt 5 SSD — was perched on my desk. I was pleased, in the way only tech nerds can be when they have a piece of gear few others do. </p>



<p>A few days later, I was more than happy to take it apart and return to a slower and more functional Thunderbolt environment. Because I am simply not sure that the Thunderbolt 5 ecosystem is ready for prime time.</p>



<p>This isn’t an indictment of Thunderbolt 5, per se. Rather, it’s all about the headaches that can accompany not one, but a multitude of devices, all of which can interact with each other in unexpected ways. Layer on software, drivers, firmware updates, and the like, and it’s tough to point an accusing finger at any one component. This is what testing cutting-edge hardware can mean: struggling with

<p>The titans of the PC industry slugged things out in 2024, jockeying for dominance in the new AI era blossoming before our eyes.</p>



<p>It was most evident in laptops: Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X Elite chips kicked off Microsoft’s Copilot+ PC era with long life and surprisingly competitive performance, only to be rivaled by Intel’s Macbook-killing Lunar Lake chips months later. AMD, meanwhile, focused on bringing high-octane <em>speed</em> to Copilot+ PCs, zigging for <em>oomph</em> while the others zagged to endurance. With competition flourishing, PCWorld expects to review over 120 laptops by the end of the year, by far a new high water mark!</p>



<p>But laptops weren’t the only category laser-focused on innovation and performance. This year, cutting-edge monitors became the norm, Thunderbolt docks and SSDs embraced newer, faster standards, Intel and AM
