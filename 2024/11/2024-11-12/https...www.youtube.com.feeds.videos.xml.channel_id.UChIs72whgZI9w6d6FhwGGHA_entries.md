AMD's Ryzen 7 9800X3D CPU has been the best launch this year, so we decided to overclock it with liquid nitrogen. Joe Stepongzi joins us to extreme overclock the 9800X3D to over 6.0 GHz for real gaming benchmarks in Stellaris. This includes our pre-stream setup and build, troubleshooting, and a stream recap. We're both out of practice, so refinding the basics was an extremely fun process on this CPU. We're excited to push the CPU -- or maybe a future 9950X3D, should one exist -- even further.
