## Marvel Rivals Designer Dishes on Environmental Destruction and Hero Synergy – IGN First
 - [https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-designer-dishes-on-environmental-destruction-and-hero-synergy-ign-first](https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-designer-dishes-on-environmental-destruction-and-hero-synergy-ign-first)

Environmental destruction and hero team-ups are two very prominent features of Marvel Rivals at the system level. Although their focus is different, at their core, they are both meant to represent the unique presence and abilities of "Marvel Heroes." If heroes canonically capable of destroying entire worlds can't even break a wall in-game, or if "ride or die" partners like Rocket Raccoon and Groot have no interactions with each other, it would create a sense of disharmony within the game and leave players with the impression that the creators do not understand Marvel heroes, let alone the Marvel universe.

IGN was recently invited to interview Zhiyong, the lead combat designer of the Marvel Rivals team, and asked him to introduce a lot of settings and information related to environmental destruction and hero team-ups, which he believes will help players better understand and become immersed in the game's content and atmosphere.
