The case against Backpage was built on lies, innuendo, and a willful misunderstanding of how the internet works.

While it&#8217;s great there&#8217;s a settlement payment on the way, the fact is that this extremely vindictive and [&#8230;]

You can use Babbel on desktop, too, and your progress is synchronized across [&#8230;]
