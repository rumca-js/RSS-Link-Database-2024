<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>My K1 Max is connected to a CyberPower CP1500PFCLCD UPS.</p> <p>This weekend, 1 hour into a 7 hour print, the power in my house flickered. Print continued with no issue.</p> <p>Then an hour and a half later, the power went completely out. I let it print for a couple of minutes, then pressed &quot;pause&quot; on the display. The printer kept the nozzle at 140, the bed at 50, and kept a fan running, and the UPS gave me 57 minutes of projected runtime.</p> <p>62 minutes later - with the UPS showing 0 minutes reserve and beeping its head off - the power came back on. Pressed resume on the printer, and the print ran to completion with no flaws or issues.</p> <p>I do wish that there was some way to have the UPS talk to the printer directly so it could auto-pause, but notwithstanding, having the UPS saved this job.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/NorthStarZero"> /u/NorthStarZero </a> <br/> <span><a href

## Hello everyone. I just finished a parametric 3d printing decor design that can also be used as a light shade. I have spent almost 10 days on it and will be updating it soon with more variants. It‚Äôs free for everyone on the group, and I‚Äôd really appreciate any feedback! Photos are just renders.
