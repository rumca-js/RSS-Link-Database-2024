My accounts (discord, instagram) were hacked and posted bitcoin scams. Thankfully the hacker couldn&#39;t rob me as I am a minor (gen alpha) with no bank account or money. Nor did anyone press the link because I have no actual friends connected irl . I changed all my passwords and hard reset my laptop, is this enough to get rid of the hacker?
