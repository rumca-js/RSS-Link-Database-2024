<ul><li>Rick Parry says EFL ‘embraces’ tougher financial rules</li><li>Parliament to discuss football regulator bill this week</li></ul><p>Rick Parry has accused the Premier League of undervaluing the football pyramid, arguing that without the “variety and competition” that come from relegation and promotion the game would become “sterile”.</p><p>The EFL chair was speaking to the Guardian before legislation for an independent football regulator <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/08/football-regulation-bill-set-to-be-put-before-parliament-within-next-month">returns to parliament</a> on Wednesday, potentially ending a four-year process of change. The EFL “embraces” stronger financial regulation, according to Parry, but he continues to argue it must come alongside greater financial redistribution from the Premier League, a goal not achieved despite years of negotiation and government pressure.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/12/efl-chief-ac

<p>In-form Newcastle defender has chance to show Thomas Tuchel he can be solution to perennial problem on left</p><p>Expectations are low before England close their uneven Nations League campaign with Thursday’s trip to Greece and Sunday’s home game against the Republic of Ireland. The withdrawals are piling up, fatigue is rising and Thomas Tuchel has decided that he has better things to do than show up to watch the team that he will inherit from Lee Carsley in January.</p><p>Yet there is still meaning to be found in these fixtures and if Tuchel could ask for one favour from Carsley it would surely be to leave him a functioning left-back. England, who clambered to the final of Euro 2024 with the right‑footed Kieran Trippier dutifully playing on his weaker side while Luke Shaw battled for full fitness, are crying out for someone to step up and make the position their own.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/12/england-nations-league-lewis-hall-audition-thomas-tu

In mid-December 2015, the BBC1 anchorman vowed to present an episode of Match of the Day wearing only his pants if Claudio Ranieri’s side ultimately managed to pull off one of the most surprising title wins in history. Five months after <a href="https://x.com/GaryLineker/status/676520648097865728">Lineker’s promise on Twitter</a> (now X), Leicester’s glory arrived in May 2016. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/13/gary-lineker-presents-match-of-the-day-in-his-underpants">Lineker was as g

Soon enough the town’s infamous rodent problem starts being an issue</p><p>The premise for this horror exercise is a potent notion, one that might have yielded a chilling work of Mitteleuropean folk horror: the Pied Piper of Hamelin is a supernatural being still kicking around the German town, luring children to their deaths as punishment for parents’ sins. Unfortunately, the film-makers fluff the brief, with too much showing and telling and not enough simmering mystery. That said, the end result is so comically tawdry and silly you can’t but wonder if its all a bit of a tongue-in-cheek goof, a gag that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/nov/07/elizabeth-hurley-if-i-were-queen-i-would-outlaw-air-fresheners-in-cars-and-ban-prison-for-white-collar-criminals">Elizabeth Hurley</a> at least seems to be in on, judging by her ripe, almost-winking performance.

<p>Our buyer’s lender has pulled out because the charge rises with the property’s rising value. Now the delay risks collapsing the whole chain</p><p><strong>We found a buyer for our leasehold flat, but on the day of exchange their lender declined to offer a mortgage, despite having previously agreed in principle. The reason was a provision in the lease for the ground rent, currently £200 per annum, to be amended every 25 years according to the market value of the property. We had no trouble securing a mortgage when we purchased the property, and it has not prevented sales of other flats in the building. We have subsequently spent thousands in legal fees trying to secure a deed of variation on the leasehold agreement to amend the ground rent clause but this has been endlessly held up by the freeholder. We now stand to lose our onward purchase.</strong></p><p><em><strong>RC, London</strong></em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2024/nov/12/our-flats-rising-ground-rent-is-

Flicking down the edge of the bundle with my finger I would glance at the huddle of boys trading the hottest commodity in the playground with a nervousness that was enough to hold me back from even trying to join in.</p><p>I could play football, sure, that was the easy part, but could I talk their talk, did I <em>know</em> football? Of course I did. I watched it, I played it, I read the back pages, but it never felt like I belonged.
