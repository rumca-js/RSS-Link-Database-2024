I talk about heat pumps a lot. They really are the most energy efficient way to heat and cool things, but the study of caloric cooling represents the potential for a new, solid-state-esque approach to managing heat. Yup, solid state. That comes with the possibility of achieving significantly higher efficiencies without refrigerants. Caloric cooling holds massive implications for the way we cool our homes, our vehicles, and maybe even ourselves. So, how does it all work? And why does it have the potential to completely change climate control?
