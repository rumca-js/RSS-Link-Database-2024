Joe Stepongzi joins us to extreme overclock the 9800X3D to over 6.0 GHz for real gaming benchmarks in Stellaris. This includes our pre-stream setup and build, troubleshooting, and a stream recap. We're both out of practice, so refinding the basics was an extremely fun process on this CPU. We're excited to push the CPU -- or maybe a future 9950X3D, should one exist -- even further.\n\nGrab our Inductor dice set with e-waste inductors! https://store.gamersnexus.net/products/inductor-full-tabletop-mtg-dnd-premium-dice-set-7-piece-dice-wooden-box-token-card\nOr our Snowflake the Cat dice set! https://store.gamersnexus.net/products/snowflake-full-tabletop-mtg-dnd-premium-dice-set-7-piece-dice-wooden-box-cat-card\nWatch the stream archive! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=709vq-ifiyU\n\nThe best way to support our work", "id": 1503001, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZMQf3RwM8Q", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 428, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UChIs72whgZI9w6d6FhwGGHA", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/MZMQf3RwM8Q/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "The AMD 9800X3D is an Insane Overclocker | Liquid Nitrogen OC Recap", "vote": 0}]
