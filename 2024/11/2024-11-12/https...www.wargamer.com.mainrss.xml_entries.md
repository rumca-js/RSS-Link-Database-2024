								<p>Back in August, the <strong>Warhammer 40,000</strong> fan canon of made-up characters was accidentally granted a new villain, thanks to a weird glitch in Google AI overviews. An AI-generated answer to a lore question referred to the non-existent character ‘War Master Harvest Lupergirl’, a mistake that was circulated widely via social media as fans chuckled at the misfiring machine.
