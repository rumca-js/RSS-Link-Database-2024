<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I was just curious if anyone else was doing this since it&#39;s pretty simple I can&#39;t be the only one.</p> <p>I found you can symlink cracked steam games save folders to actual steam cloud saves folders, then launch and kill the actual steam game to initiate steam cloud save upload/sync.</p> <p>I did this because I was playing some JRPG on routine work trips on laptop and didn&#39;t want to setup other third party cloud saving. I probably wouldn&#39;t have ever bothered if i played cracked from the start, but in this case i played the steam free demo first and was already used to the cloud saving to begin with.</p> <p>will you get banned doing this? maybe, i&#39;ve no idea!</p> <p>for the exact way i was doing it, I use playnite and have the games customized to run script after exiting:</p> <pre><code>start steam://rungameid/xxxxxxx &lt;actual steam game&gt; start-sleep -milliseconds 1950 &lt;this is probably unnecessarily long...&gt; taskkill /i

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>With the Nintendo Switch 2 almost on its way, If Apache is a Linux program for hosting your own webserver and Mastadon is a program for hosting your own Twitter-like social media server then is there a Linux program out there for hosting your own Git Repository instead of the current system where everything is centralized on either github/gitlab/etc. so like this companies like Nintendo will have a harder time taking down projects</p> <p>I decentralized git repository with security, login, and admin approval would mean that every single new project ever designed would be self hosted in a closed ecosystem and decentralized so people with a copy of the source code for say Switch emulators Yuzu and Ryujinx can continue to improve the code in a closed ecosystem and then release say Beta or Stable releases on say Pirate Bay or such</p> <p>Another idea i had is the same way with torrents, multiple seeders means multiple people have<br/> a copy of the file,
