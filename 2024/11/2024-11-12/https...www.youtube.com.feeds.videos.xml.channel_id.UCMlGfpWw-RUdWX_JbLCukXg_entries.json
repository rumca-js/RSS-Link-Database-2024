And deep down, we know that Boolean algebra underlies everything we do. But we seldom give it a second thought, or if we do, we probably dismiss it as trivial; something we learned in college and quickly outgrew.\n\nThis talk shows the unreasonable effectiveness of going back to basics and really understanding and unlocking the power of Boolean algebra in the design of a message handling library for embedded systems. We\u2019ll talk about separating message layout and semantics, how to match against messages for dispatch, and particularly how to compose and simplify constraints at compile time, in order to do the least at runtime. We\u2019ll also introduce Boolean implication and see a non-obvious application which is key to a generic approach. Finally we\u2019ll see how message matchers can be generically transformed using compile-time in", "id": 1503537, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-q9Omkhl62I", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 420, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCMlGfpWw-RUdWX_JbLCukXg", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/-q9Omkhl62I/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Message Handling with Boolean Algebra - Ben Deane - CppCon 2024", "vote": 0}]
