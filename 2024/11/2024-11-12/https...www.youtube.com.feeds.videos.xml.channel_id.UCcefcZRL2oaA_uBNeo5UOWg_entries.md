In the past, when massive technological change came about, people ended up doing different types of work than they did in the past. Often the types of new careers that are created have better working conditions and are more helpful to humanity.

We would like to fund startups that have a useful need to employ a million workers in a way that uniquely needs humans to do the job, and there will be no structural need for the job to be done with AI.

Custom ASICs and FPGAs can optimize calculations such as data compression, inference, or encryption tasks, theoretically 5x faster with 10x less energy, which is a breakthrough. 

We'd love to fund LLM-based systems to build these, and with OpenAI o1 it's an ideal time to do it.

The last two years have been rough for fintech startups. The SVB collapse led to regulators clamping down, and investors fled the space. 

That was good for incumbents and bad for new fintechs.

We hope that's about to change and now is a great time to build a fintech startup.

Engineering tools for the physical world have barely evolved in decades. All still rely on complex numerical solvers and physics simulations, and these are computationally expensive and require deep training— at times even a PhD to use effectively.

We believe the next generation of AI-powered tools will change that. 

We’re eager to see founders build the AI-aided engineering tools that will drive this transformation as the new generation of Computer-aided Engineering.
