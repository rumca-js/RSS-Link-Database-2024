<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Some weeks ago, I installed Biabnu OS 2.0. Since then, no &quot;intermediate&quot; updates via &quot;sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt upgrade -y&quot;</p> <p>A few days ago: something like &quot;there is a release upgrade, 2.0.1 use do-release-upgrade&quot;.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I just received my Jupiter yesterday, and while I was looking through it, I noticed that in the Ubuntu image provided, there is no Wi-Fi setting under the network options only dual Ethernet. Am I missing something to enable the Wi-Fi, or do I have a dead-on-arrival (DOA) Wi-Fi card? I saw in Jeff Geerling&#39;s video that he had a DOA Wi-Fi chip, so I&#39;m concerned that mine might be the same. Has anyone else experienced this?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Totalkiller4"> /u/Totalkiller4 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1gphd25/milk_v_jupiter_wifi/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1gphd25/milk_v_jupiter_wifi/">[comments]</a></span>
