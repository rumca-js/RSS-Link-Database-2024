<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><pre><code>So I&#39;ve been working with django for a few months now, and I&#39;ve been thinking a lot about a good way of organizing my templates and projects. This is just a thought and I plan to refactor a project or two to see if it meshes well with this, but here&#39;s what I&#39;m thinking: limiting every app&#39;s templates to strictly adhere to the following folder structure. components - [component_x_folder] - component_x.py - component_x.js - component_x.css - template_x.html ... includes - [include_x_folder] - include_x.html ... widgets - [widget_x_folder] - widget_x.html ... layouts - sections - [section_x_folder] - section_x.html ... - partials - [x-partial_x_folder] - x-partial_x.html ... - _base.html ... pages - [page_x_folder] - sections - ... - pages - ... - partials - ... - page_x.html ====================== EXPLAINING THE FOLDERS ====================== 1. layouts ---------- - Contains templates for defining app layouts, &lt;link&gt; t
