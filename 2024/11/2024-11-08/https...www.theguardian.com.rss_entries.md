It featured footage of the final two minutes from the game 11 years ago between these teams, on this pitch, where New Zealand raised themselves from the dead: another harrowing event for the home team and their supporters; another flag planted on New Zealand’s hill of invincibility.</p><p>The final two minutes here told a different story: no need to overhaul a deficit; no need to nail touchline conversion; no need to sweat any bullets.

<p>Steve Borthwick’s side need to find another gear and a different mindset to end their frustrating run of narrow defeats</p><p>All year England have been a team who find themselves in arm wrestles and last weekend was no different. They get themselves into tight matches that are still in the balance in the final few minutes - it has almost become the trademark of this team. They’ve played eight matches against tier one nations and the aggregate margin has been 27 points. The biggest margin has been against Scotland, when they lost by nine, but the rest have been decided by a score or less.</p><p>That tells me that England have adopted a certain mindset this year but, based on the evidence, they are not very good at winning tight matches. The ledger reads won three, lost five so my question is, do England need to find a way to get better at winning tight matches? Or do they find another way to win matches? My opinion is that they should go for the latter.</p> <a href="https://www.th

Sign up now!</a></strong></p><p>In the experience of Football Daily, hearing Mark Robins speak is an interaction with an entirely normal, grounded human being, an intelligent, plausible, honest man. In a world of bluster and buzzwords, Robins speaks sensibly, realistically. For Coventry City he was the shy Messiah, leading the club out of its darkest hours, taking them within minutes – inches even – of the promised land. Visit the Coventry City Building Society Stadium and encounter a kind of faded grandeur. The glory days were at Highfield Road. Its replacement, the Ricoh, as it was first known at the start of a torrid history that continues with Mike Ashley as landlord, is modern, glassy, a cashless society with a statue of Jimmy Hill at its entrance. Perhaps one day Robins will be afforded a bronze tribute as the man who took the floodlit dreams of

<p><strong>Linbury theatre, London</strong><br>Sophie Laplane’s If at First switches so fast stylistically that it might be garbled, while Mthuthuzeli November’s The Waiting Game stages an existential crisis</p><p>Sophie Laplane’s new ballet, If at First, is more like 10 different ballets in one. It has a soundtrack that skips wildly between genres – Beethoven to avant jazz to new music by Tom Harrold – as if there’s a glitchy skip button somewhere, jerking from one playlist to another. The only constant is a white crown passed around the stage, anointing characters in turn, mirrors held up to reflect their glory.<br><br>
 This double bill from Ballet Black is titled Heroes in reference to Laplane’s piece, attempting to honour small acts of heroism in the everyday, but the piece has so many facets as to become garbled, pulling from one mode to the next without a sense of who, what or why. The stylistic switches mean we might jump from sultry female duet, to two sweet but tragic lover

<p>It could have been better designed, but Rachel Reeves’s inheritance tweak will help farmers with mud on their boots</p><p>Should multimillionaire landowners benefit<strong> </strong>from a tax break designed to help small family farms pass down their land to their children? This is a hotly contested question, given last week’s budget. Labour has reintroduced 20% inheritance tax for farms that are valued at more than £1m, meaning the children of farmers will no longer inherit land tax-free. Granted, 20% is still only half of the standard inheritance tax rate, and it probably sounds more than generous to an ex-miner, foundry worker or shipbuilder. But today, £1m would only buy you about 40 hectares (100 acres) of farmland, which is far short of a viable farm.</p><p>Farming is a long-term business that requires substantial assets and often makes only meagre returns. Farming families have not had to consider tax planning for family succession since 1992. As a second-generation farmer,

<p><strong>Malvern Theatres, Great Malvern</strong><br>The Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment combine virtuosity with a practised nonchalance to soothe our age’s anxieties </p><p>On a day that seemed to herald a new age of anxiety, the <a href="https://oae.co.uk/mission/our-story/">Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment </a>offered consolation in the form of Bach’s Brandenburg Concertos. Before embarking on their series entitled Bach, the Universe and Everything, they are taking the <a href="https://oae.co.uk/whats-on/">Brandenburgs on tour</a> and while the Malvern didn’t quite get the full complement of six – No 1 was missing – this was still a huge lift to the spirits, Bach’s essential rhythmic vitality somehow representing resilience.</p><p>The Malvern theatres, once a ballroom, is not the obvious place for baroque repertoire, but with a wooden panelled screen in front of the black curtains allowing the acoustic to work well enough, the various combinations of soloists – each c

<p>The virtuoso jazz guitarist has worked with a string of legends, winning 20 Grammys in the process. He speaks on his beginnings as a jazz trumpeter, and still striving to improve at 70</p><p>Pat Metheny is pretty much everywhere. For the past four decades, the 70-year-old guitarist has been crisscrossing the globe, playing an average of 150 shows a year. Instantly recognisable thanks to his wild mop of hair and the custom three-necked, 42-string guitar he wields on stage, Metheny has released more than 50 albums, won 20&nbsp;Grammys and collaborated with David Bowie and Joni Mitchell, as well&nbsp;as free jazz pioneer Ornette Coleman and bass legend Jaco Pastorius. When we speak, he is 160 dates into a solo tour and fighting with patchy wifi in a hotel in Nancy, France, that aptly leaves an image of a guitar with hundreds of strings on screen rather than his signature plumage.</p><p>While he meticulously keeps written records of each show to improve on his&nbsp;performance, Methen

He was no liberal, but it’s a line many Democrats today would be taken with.

<p>Seventeenth-century riverside cottages with a warren of tiny spaces have been transformed into a sanctuary for modern living</p><p>At first glance, you might think it was&nbsp;its good old-fashioned period charm that convinced Lee Thornley to splash his cash on this 1650s double-fronted cottage in Poppleton, a tranquil village on the outskirts of&nbsp;York. However, it was more than good looks that persuaded Thornley, founder of the tile company Bert &amp; May, and his partner, Phil Brocklebank, to&nbsp;make this their forever family home with their two daughters, Lyla, 14, and Iris, 11, plus dogs Tilly&nbsp;and&nbsp;Molly.</p><p>“It ticked boxes that most houses don’t,” says Thornley. “The River Ouse is literally at the bottom of the garden, so it had the potential to offer a very&nbsp;different way of life.

<p>The Booker-winning author on the the joys of Flann O’Brien, the magic of EL Doctorow, and having doubts about Richard Dawkins</p><p><strong>My earliest reading&nbsp;memory</strong><br>
 My mother taught me how to read. I was happy enough in school but at&nbsp;some point she must have realised that I wasn’t learning anything; I&nbsp;think I was seven. So my&nbsp;earliest memory of reading is sitting with my mother at the kitchen table, looking at a comic called Sparky. Her finger was under a word in one of the speech bubbles, and I&nbsp;recognised it, and the next one, and the next. I&nbsp;was up and running. By the end of the next day, I’d finished Nietzsche and had moved on to Dostoevsky.</p><p><strong>My favourite book&nbsp;growing up</strong><br>
 When I was 10 or 11 I&nbsp;probably knew Richmal&nbsp;Crompton’s Just William off by heart. There were two things about the book that I&nbsp;loved, and still do: William always got away&nbsp;with it, and the adults&nbsp;were idiots.</

<p><strong>New Music Players/Orchestra of Sound and Light</strong><br><strong>(Métier)<br></strong>Inspired by the South Downs near Brighton, this selection box of new work from contemporary composers is English to its core – and yet defies tradition</p><p>Musical invocations of Englishness can mean anything from Elgar to Davey Graham to the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/sexpistols">Sex Pistols</a>. They can be nostalgic and pastoral, mournful or dystopian. In classical settings, “Englishness” often translates as something tweedy and bucolic, inspired by modal folk music and suspicious of continental experimentation. On this album, five contemporary British composers write music inspired by the South Downs near Brighton, and all seem palpably “English” in some way. Yet all defy tradition, and many link with broader trends in jazz and the avant garde.</p><p>Many of these pieces draw from written sources, sung by Rachel Farago.

<p>England has been the most successful nation in senior events, but competition has become stiffer in Europe, while the US has won the world over-50 teams two years running</p><p>England’s success in senior events has been outstanding in recent years, but there are indications that the golden era, which was already ­challenged by US over-50 team victories in 2023 and 2024, may be undermined ­further by individuals and teams from Eastern&nbsp;Europe.</p><p>At the European individual 65+ championship in Lignano Sabbiadoro, on the Adriatic coast in Northern Italy, the holder, GM John Nunn, was the strong favourite, but finished only sixth with 6.5/9.

She talks about inequality, misogyny – and being haunted</p><p>There is nothing ostensibly special about Mumbai, according to Payal Kapadia. There is no iconic building to photograph, no ancient history to mine. “It’s a post-colonial city that didn’t exist before the British came and joined seven islands, purely for capitalism.”</p><p>But for the director, who has become one of Indian cinema’s biggest names, there is a magic at the heart of the country’s financial capital, one imperceptible to the naked eye. “Mumbai is defined by the people who travel from all across India to live and work there,” Kapadia says. “The city is in a constant state of flux.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/nov/08/women-are-made-to-feel-as-if-theyre-against-each-other-the-hit-indian-film-that-challenges-the-patriarchy">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Sharon Horgan’s pitch-black comedy is back, plus a gripping new drama about a mother of 10 abducted in Northern Ireland during the Troubles</p><p>While <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/aug/19/bad-sisters-review-sharon-horgan-pitch-black-comedy-is-murderously-good">season one</a> provided a very satisfactory conclusion to the Garvey sisters’ feud with the monstrous John Paul, the aftermath of a murder can’t easily be shrugged off. So even if it does begin with a blissful Grace remarrying, the second series of Sharon Horgan’s black comedy has plenty to work with. After the body of John Paul’s father is fished out of a lake, the cops are all over his mother’s house and the Garveys have a new antagonist in the shape of Angelica (Fiona Shaw), the sister of Grace’s former neighbour Roger. It’s carried along by the writing, which balances trauma with salty humour, and the glorious performances that perfectly evoke the exasperation of sibling relationships. <em><br>

<p>Art nouveau cafes, Ottoman architecture and beer halls make these modest cities a big draw away from the crowds</p><p>I got off the train to Venice last summer in Trieste, planning to spend a few hours there, but was so knocked over by its beauty that I stayed for a few days. Tucked away in the north-east of Italy, it’s a crosscultural cocktail of Hapsburg, baroque and Slavic views and vibes – with a slice of Latin lemon thrown in. Piazza Unità d’Italia is an elegant square full of classy art nouveau cafes with the sea on one side – locally known as the Living Room of Italy. I strolled along Barcola for the evening <em>passeggiata</em> after checking out the nearby <a href="https://miramare.cultura.gov.it/en/">Miramare castle</a>. There are beaches on the edge of the city that are easy to walk to – I had a swim one day. The food is hearty – Germanic meaty stews and spicy pizzas - while the coffee is strong.

<p>Lucas Paquetá is struggling, Ruud van Nistelrooy nears Old Trafford farewell and will Luis Díaz play as a striker again?</p><p>Brentford have scored nine and conceded six in their past two Premier League home games. Their leaky defence did not cost them in victories over Wolves and Ipswich but they were shown up by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/04/fulham-brentford-premier-league-match-report">Harry Wilson’s injury-time double</a> on Monday night at Fulham to suggest things need to improve at the back. Wilson’s goals both came from crosses. Brentford allowed Fulham to cross the ball 43 times, although Thomas Frank was not too worried about it and was surprisingly relaxed that they led to two goals. With Ethan Pinnock and Nathan Collins, he does have centre-backs capable of dealing with the majority but it is a dangerous game to play. Bournemouth will have taken note and their fine wingers and full-backs will probably target the space afforded out wide. <str
