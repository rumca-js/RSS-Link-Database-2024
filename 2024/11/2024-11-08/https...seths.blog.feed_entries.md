I love Zamboni machines. They&#8217;re ungainly, they&#8217;re slow but they&#8217;re also majestic. Like an elephant for ice hockey. After each period, when the ice is chopped up by play, the Zamboni rolls out and leaves behind a sheet of perfect ice. Cold, smooth and untouched. It&#8217;s useful to acknowledge that the same service is offered [&#8230;]
