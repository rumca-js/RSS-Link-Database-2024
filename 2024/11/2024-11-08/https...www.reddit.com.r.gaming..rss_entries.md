<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Almost 40, being playing video games since I was 5 and finding that games just don&#39;t hold my attention like they use to. I feel like part of it is the predictability factor/lack of originality in gaming. Just played the first 20 minutes of the Dead Space remake and although I could see the appeal I just didn&#39;t feel immersed in the game. I just sat there thinking &quot;Oh, and this jump scare will pop up here...and I was right....and then I&#39;ll think I&#39;m safe but monster will appe...yup, there he is&quot;. And this didn&#39;t always happen for me. Historically I&#39;ve been really bad at predicting what would happen next in a game/movie/show. I remember constantly being surprised by things in games growing up but now I feel a really big lack of originality in what I play. There are exceptions over the last 5 years for me (What Happened To Edith Finch, Persona 5, Final Fantasy Remake, HZD) but I can&#39;t count how many games I&#39;ve in

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>For me it was Final Fantasy XIV. After losing someone near to me I needed time and a safe place to just be for awhile. I completely fell in love with the game, the music and the nice people I met there. Once I started feeling better I played less but that game really provided exactly the kind of escapism I needed in dark time of my life.</p> <p>Also, if you are going through something difficult, it is always good to get support from people around you. I think a game can&#39;t really replace our need for IRL human connection.
