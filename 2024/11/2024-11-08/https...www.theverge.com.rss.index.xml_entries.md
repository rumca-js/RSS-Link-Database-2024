  <p id="nHh25K">The Beatles have been nominated for two Grammys — nearly 50 years after the band <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/entertainment/music/1921602/surprising-tale-beatles-breakup-timeline">officially split up</a>. Their final song, called “Now and Then,” was restored last year with the help of AI, and is now up for record of the year alongside the likes of Beyoncé, Charlie XCX, Billie Eilish, and Taylor Swift. It’s also been nominated for best rock performance, where it goes up against Green Day, Pearl Jam, and The Black Keys.</p>
