GUS PnP and Amiga both weren't good with it. The remix comes from A1200 1.D4 using HippoPlayer 2.61 and its xmaplay060 option. Xmaplay060 (from 8bitbubsy) is a very accurate replayer for XM files, but sadly doesn't support CyberSound's 14-bit calibration file and has limited mixing rate (27710Hz). Still sounds good here though.", "id": 1478243, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WoYHDE6lK1k", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 180, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCJKt_QVDyUbqdm3ag_py2eQ", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/WoYHDE6lK1k/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "FastTracker music: Sunny - The Forgotten Name + remix (AWE64 Gold + A1200 raw)", "vote": 0}]
