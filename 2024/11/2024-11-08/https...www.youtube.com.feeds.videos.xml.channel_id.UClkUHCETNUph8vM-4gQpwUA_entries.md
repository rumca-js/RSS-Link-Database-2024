S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl – Will It Live Up To The Hype?
S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl, developed by GSC Game World, is the anticipated follow-up to the cult-classic S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series. Set to release on November 20, 2024, this first-person shooter puts players once again in the unpredictable terrain of the Chornobyl Exclusion Zone, an area ravaged by both radiation and mysterious anomalies. In this sequel, players take on the role of Skif, navigating a non-linear story filled with choices that can alter not only personal outcomes but also global events within the Zone. Heart of Chornobyl will launch on PC and Xbox Series X, available through platforms like Steam, Epic Games Store, Microsoft Store, and GOG. Additionally, it will be accessible via Xbox Game Pass on launch, and though no PS5 version has been confirmed, the game’s timed exclusivity hints at a potential release in the future.
