I colorized, restored and created sound design for this video of San Francisco 1938 with this captivating journey through iconic locations. From vintage planes at the airport to bustling trains, ferries and the city's famous cable cars, discover San Francisco's bustling streets and iconic landmarks like the Golden Gate Bridge, the Bay Bridge and the bustling financial district. Stroll through Golden Gate Park, Chinatown and historic sites such as the Coit Tower and the Palace of Fine Arts. These rare images illustrate everyday life, iconic architecture and lively scenes from a bygone era.
