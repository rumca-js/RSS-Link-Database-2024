I set up a Raspberry Pi as a Home Assistant control board.

I also set it up to run a CarPlay display on my old Toyota.

Thanks to Raspberry Pi for sending the Touch Display 2 for testing. They did not pay anything for this video nor did they have any say in its contents. See my sponsorship policies: https://github.com/geerlingguy/youtube?tab=readme-ov-file#sponsorships
