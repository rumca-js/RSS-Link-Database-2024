<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>For those feeling the sadness, despair, anguish, fear and anger of this week, I highly recommend this book. I first read it in 2016 and it has been my guiding light since, especially in the face of political upheaval (on all sides of the spectrum) and the lure of pessimism and apathy. Below is one of my favorite passages from the book:</p> <p>“To hope is to gamble. It’s to bet on the future, on your desires, on the possibility that an open heart and uncertainty is better than gloom and safety. To hope is dangerous, and yet it is the opposite of fear, for to live is to risk. </p> <p>I say all this because hope is not like a lottery ticket you can sit on the sofa and clutch, feeling lucky. I say it because hope is an ax you break down doors with in an emergency; because hope should shove you out the door, because it will take everything you have to steer the future away from endless war, from the annihilation of the earth’s treasures and the grinding d

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Today, I finished reading The Passenger. Wow…just, wow…what a remarkable book! The Passenger is not like other McCarthy books. It’s more of a mystery, and I rather enjoyed seeing McCarthy’s style of writing be used to make a mystery come to life. </p> <p>I have a strange habit of not researching McCarthy’s books enough before reading them. I stumbled into Blood Meridian and was unprepared for the violence in that story. Meanwhile, I stumbled into The Passenger and was unprepared for the depth of sadness the characters experienced and the depth of sadness those characters would lead me to experience. I’m just a guy trying to enjoy a book during his lunch break. Instead, I find myself deep in mourning for Bobby and Alicia. I feel an incredible sense of loss after reading this book.</p> <p>I realize this is a disjointed post. Was anyone else in shambles after finishing The Passenger? Should I anticipate more of the same in Stella Maris?</p> </div><!-- S

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not just Faulkner, only that I was trying to reread The Sound and the Fury, and gave up. Not sure how I got through it the first time. I mean I could power through it, the second chapter especially, but it would be just not enjoyable.</p> <p>Anyways, the reason for the difficulty, the stream-of-consciousness technique, is not the technique that only Faulkner used.. Many others used it way more than he did. You find it in a lot of old books, now considered classic. These authors experimented with one form or another stream-of-consciousness writing, especially in the early 1900s. Joyce, Woolf, and others are examples.</p> <p>To be honest, I find it enjoyable in small doses. It&#39;s creative, it&#39;s different. And I respect authors who took big risks instead of settling for tried and true methods that had popular appeal.</p> <p>But I can&#39;t lie and say I understand what&#39;s going on or have fun reading those passages.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I just finished reading Rebecca by Daphne du Maurier and really enjoyed scanning through some reddit posts discussing it!</p> <p>I was shocked that this was labeled as a romance novel on the cover of the copy I read. There was truly nothing romantic about it, only sad and horrifying.</p> <p>The narrator reminded me of a younger version of myself in a lot of ways. I have OCD and one of my compulsions is rehearsing what I would do/say for any possible scenario in addition to people pleasing and just anxiety in general. I am NOT saying the narrator was written with OCD, but it’s very obvious she is riddled with anxiety. The way we see her carry out what people could say and what she would say reminds me a lot of my own compulsions. Even down to the way Maxim describes the narrator mouthing silent words and dissociating when she does it. </p> <p>The narrator also doesn’t seem to have any family or caretaker ties. When she is excited to send a letter, she

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>HUGE DISCLAIMER. I throughly enjoyed the battle royale movie, it’s a fun watch. The director Kinji Fukasaku, was truly passionate about making it, the camerawork is great, and for its time, it holds up. But I’m not planning on discussing the quality of the film, rather I wish to talk about how the movie is a genuinely awful adaptation of koushun takami’s characters, it genuinely I mean genuinely butchers and nearly ruining some of Koushun’s well crafted characters ( specifically YOSHITOKI KUNINOBU. ) plus there are a lot of missing and changed elements to the adaptation, but i won’t go over them due to the fact things had to be changed due to the movie format. The only reason I’m going over the characters I mentioned is because they didn’t need to be cut out or changed (in Shinji’s case, he still has a lot of scenes to himself, but they aren’t remotely what happened in novel) </p> <p>The tldr is long, but it’s not as long as the post itself, since th

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I know this sound dumb but I have this weird habit where if I&#39;m really enjoying a book, which happens rarely enough, I sort of don&#39;t want it to end. With movies, I guess I&#39;ve never actually stopped a movie to save it for another day. Maybe it never really occurred to me or maybe because watching TV or movies is a way more passive hobby. That&#39;s not true of books. Reading involves effort. And the more effort I put into it, if I enjoy it, the harder it is for me to end it. </p> <p>This usually happens with longer books that I have read. Naturally, these books take their time to establish the setting and introduce everybody to you gradually, so by the time you are in the middle of the book, you sort of feel like you have gotten to know the character quite well, like friends or family members.</p> <p>For example, with Les Misérables. The last few pages took forever to read. I didn&#39;t want it to end. I wanted there to be a Les Miserables
