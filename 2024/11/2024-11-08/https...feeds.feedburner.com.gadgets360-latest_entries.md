SpaceX’s Dragon is set to perform its first reboost of the International Space Station (ISS) on Nov. 8. This mission, conducted in partnership with NASA, is a step towards a future in which a larger Dragon spacecraft will play a crucial role in safely deorbiting the ISS when its mission concludes around 2030. Currently, reboosts are generally managed by Russian Soyuz spacecraft. The reboost will supply data essential for developing the Dragon’s deorbit capabilities, marking a milestone in the ISS's operational timeline.
