Lightning Talk: Nothing - Dom Davies - ACCU 2024
---

Dom Davies addresses the concept of "nothing," turning an unexpected lack of visual aids into a humorous exploration of the topic. Despite an initial plan to present random slides, the speaker improvises, discussing the philosophical and scientific implications of "nothing." They highlight how, even when we perceive nothing, there is always something present, whether in the form of particles, energy, or thoughts. The talk delves into the complexities of defining "nothing" and concludes with a reflection on how discussing nothing invariably results in conveying something meaningful.
