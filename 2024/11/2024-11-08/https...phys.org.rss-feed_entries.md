Since soon after our planet formed, Earth's 4.6 billion-year-long history was dominated by single-celled life. Something dramatic happened about 500 million years ago called the Cambrian "explosion," during which an incredible diversity of life forms became preserved in the rock record. These fossils included major groups of diverse animals that evolved into animal groups still living today (including humans).

If I ask you to picture a radio telescope, you probably imagine a large dish pointing to the sky, or even an array of dish antennas such as the Very Large Array. What you likely don't imagine is something that resembles a TV dish in your neighbor's backyard. With modern electronics, it is relatively easy to build your own radio telescope. To understand how it can be done, check out a recent paper by Jack Phelps posted to the arXiv preprint server.

Culturing, a term for growing microorganisms in the laboratory, is a basic yet indispensable method in microbiology research. Microorganisms are often cultured in a liquid medium that provides essential nutrients, and this process is both simple and highly effective. In addition to nutrients, oxygen availability is also critical for the growth of aerobic microorganisms. However, oxygen does not dissolve easily in the liquid medium. As a result, the medium needs to be forcibly aerated, usually by shaking.
