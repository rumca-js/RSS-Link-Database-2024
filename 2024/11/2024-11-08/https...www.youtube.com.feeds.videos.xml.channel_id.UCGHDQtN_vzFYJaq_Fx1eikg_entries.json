This man robbed a bank for an entirely different reason, and it all went wrong for him.\n\n\n\"Bank robbery is the criminal act of stealing from a bank, specifically while bank employees and customers are subjected to force, violence, or a threat of violence. This refers to robbery of a bank branch or teller, as opposed to other bank-owned property, such as a train, armored car, or (historically) stagecoach. It is a federal crime in the United States.\nAccording to the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Uniform Crime Reporting Program, robbery is \"the taking or attempting to take anything of value from the care, custody, or control of a person or persons by force or threat of force or violence or by putting the victim in fear.\" By contrast, burglary is \"unlawful entry of a structure to commit a felony or theft.\"\"\n\nMore on Wikipedia: \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_robbery\n\nJoin membership: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCG", "id": 1480917, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtgeO1pZ5zU", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 447, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCGHDQtN_vzFYJaq_Fx1eikg", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/dtgeO1pZ5zU/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "The Ironic Punishment of the World's Worst Bank Robber | Tales From the Bottle", "vote": 0}]
