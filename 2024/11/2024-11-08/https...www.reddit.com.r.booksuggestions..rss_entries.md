I love them and it feels mean to say, but they&#39;re just kinda ignorant.</p> <p>Like, my other niece didn&#39;t know what the holocaust was. She thought it was called &quot;hollercoaster&quot; and she thought it was a &quot;a place that had something to do with the jews or something.&quot; She&#39;s 18.
