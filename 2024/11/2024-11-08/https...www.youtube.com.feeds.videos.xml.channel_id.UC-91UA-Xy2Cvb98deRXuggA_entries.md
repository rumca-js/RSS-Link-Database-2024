Explore the absurdity of forced return-to-office (RTO) policies with Fidelity Investments as a prime example. Dive into the reality behind their remote work reversal, packed offices, and corporate culture events that miss the mark. See firsthand the challenges employees face and question whether RTO is truly about collaboration or just outdated corporate showmanship. Stay informed, laugh along, and question the status quo.
