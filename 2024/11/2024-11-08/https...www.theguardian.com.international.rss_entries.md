<p>These days it sits awkwardly above a Subway on a busy Melbourne street, but head inside and find a truly spectacular space that has survived a century</p><p>It sits in the centre of Melbourne, arguably on its most prominent street, and yet the Capitol theatre feels like the most overlooked building in the state. The beloved but strangely occluded Chicago-Gothic cinema, designed by married American architects Walter Burley and Marion Mahony Griffin, turns 100 years old this week. It seems the perfect time for a reappraisal of this 20th century architectural wonder – its truly spectacular interior remaining stubbornly tucked behind a utilitarian facade.</p><p>The Capitol was commissioned by a conglomerate of businessmen who had already developed Luna Park and had worked with the Griffins (famous for designing Canberra) on the neighbouring Palais de Danse in St Kilda. The first of the large “picture palaces” – single-screen cinemas designed to take advantage of the booming interest i

There are two kinds of spark, says relationship psychologist Susan Quilliam: “One which is about excitement, and one which is about contentment.” At the start of a relationship, excitement often means “a sexual or emotional attraction, or a surge of optimism and hope”. Still, that doesn’t mean you can’t experience it after decades together. You might, for example, feel this spark as a swell of pleasure when you catch your partner’s eye across a crowded room and smile. As for the spark of contentment, “that can only come from experience and trust, and takes time to build,” Quilliam says

<p>Convenience stores are a neat and functional retail institution in Japan, where customers can access the daily essentials, from buying breakfast to paying bills</p><p>Kenji Yamamoto was unsure that his business would survive when he opened Japan’s first convenience store in a Tokyo neighbourhood in May 1974. The 7-Eleven outlet he ran with his wife stocked tinned food and detergents, items that most people had previously bought from supermarkets. His first sale was a pair of sunglasses.</p><p>Half a century later, it is not only the Yamamotos’ bright red and orange uniforms that have changed. Convenience stores – or <em>konbini</em> – are no longer a late-night alternative to early-closing supermarkets, but a retail institution that millions of Japanese people could not imagine life without.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/08/coffee-sandwiches-underwear-beer-day-in-the-life-japan-konbini-stores">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Mud trials showcase heavily modified two-wheel drive cars built to withstand violent impacts as drivers navigate a series of muddy obstacles</p><p>On Sunday afternoon in the usually quiet New South Wales village of Pallamallawa, the air vibrates with the roar of V8 engines as colourful cars speed toward deep, muddy trenches at 80km/h.

<p>The whole horror show seems so predictable now, doesn’t it? Just like it did the last time ...</p><p>My husband knows masses more about US politics than me, so do imagine how much he enjoyed me spending the best part of the past two years telling him “Trump’s going to win” simply because I felt it in my vibes. However, earlier this year, he started to agree with me, which I had to concede meant a lot because he was basing it on actual information, and had the first clue what he was talking about. Scrolling back through my text messages to him, I am reading things such as: “Sorry, Harris is ‘selling joy’???? Please tell me the election anywhere in history that was won on joy because I would LOVE to hear about it.” (Sidenote: I can see from reviewing the data that I’ve really over-leaned into the sassy question mark this year.)</p><p>Anyway, there’s plenty more in this vein. “I don’t believe all this polling, I just think it’s all some massive cope?” Yet when I was asked on the afte

<p>This tricksy caper ranges from 1980s Cambridge to the rise and fall of Liz Truss with entertaining results</p><p>Well, it worked for Richard Osman. Twenty-three-year-old Phyl, stuck in her parents’ house with an English degree and a zero-hours job in a sushi chain, is wondering how hard it could be to write a cosy crime novel. “Death in a Thatched Cottage? The Beach Hut Murders? The Flapjack Poisonings?” As another character points out, it’s bizarre that violent homicide has been rebranded as “cosy”. “It’s very British, in some indefinable way.”</p><p>Jonathan Coe, the laureate of Britishness, sets his 15th novel against a particularly wobbly period of national history: the short-lived ascendancy of Liz Truss and the death of the Queen in autumn 2022. It is indeed a happily playful and nicely satisfying slice of cosy crime, scattered with clues and red herrings, locked‑room mysteries, teetering cliffhangers and stagily withheld information. Before she is shocked out of her apathy
