<p>There are plenty of ways to clear an area or get rid of some pesky blocks in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/minecraft/">Minecraft</a>. However, demolishing a space with TNT is easily the most satisfying way to do so. TNT is more of a gimmick item in Minecraft, but it does have some solid uses. Before you can even think about what to blow up with your TNT, though, you need to know how to craft it and how to set it off.</p><h2>How to make TNT in Minecraft</h2><p>The crafting recipe for TNT is quite simple and requires only two ingredients. Only one of those items is somewhat difficult to get, so you shouldn't have any trouble crafting TNT once you've established yourself in Minecraft. You can see the full crafting recipe for TNT below:</p><ul><li>At a crafting table, place two blocks of Sand in the top and bottom middle boxes and two more blocks of Sand in the middle of the outer columns.</li><li>Fill the rest of the crafting table with Gunpowder to make one TNT</li></ul><f

<p>The open-world of Red Dead Redemption 2 is built on rules, but what happens when they're broken? One modder was so obsessed with making horses and carriages move at supersonic speeds that they didn't stop to consider the consequences, and it looks like the mod has led to some homicidal horseplay. No matter where you are in the game, you'll never be safe as this mod sure likes to stirrup trouble.</p><p>As demonstrated by <a href="https://x.com/Blurbstv/status/1854590427024048422">BlurbsTV</a>, their mod turns Red Dead Redemption 2 into a horror spectacle that Alfred Hitchcock would be proud of.</p><div data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14H_QpiPt8I" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/14H_QpiPt8I" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>Think you can mind your own business on a desolate stretch of l

<p>Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick has commented on the state of the AAA video game market, saying "it's hard and getting harder."

And that's true of all entertainment businesses as they begin to mature," he said. "The quality threshold that the consumer demands always goes up."</p><p>Zelnick claimed Take-Two is uniquely positioned to succeed in this challenging market because its core goals are to be the "most creative, the most innovative, and the most efficient company in the entertainment industry."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-parent-company-boss-on-state-of-aaa-gam

<p>Sony just revealed new sales numbers for PS5, and set expectations on what kinds of games will be coming in the future for the console.</p><p>In a new <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/24q2_sonypre.pdf">financial report from Sony</a>, the company said it shipped 3.8 million PS5 consoles during the second quarter of the fiscal year from July 2024 to September 2024. That was 29% drop from the same time period last year. The new lifetime total units shipped is now 65.5 million, making the amount just shy of the 67.5 million PS4 units shipped when it was in the same period of its lifespan.</p><p>On the bright side, Game &amp; Network Services division brought in about $7 billion, a 12% year-over-year increase. Sony attributed this to third-party games on the PS5 platform, including "an action RPG title from China," which is most likely referring to Black Myth: Wukong.

<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's creative director has commented on how Game Pass positively affected the game's launch, saying it helped improve player numbers in multiple ways.</p><p>Speaking to the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cev90rmyel2o?xtor=AL-72-[partner]-[bbc.news.twitter]-[headline]-[news]-[bizdev]-[isapi]&amp;at_link_id=67BD7544-9D06-11EF-9772-A1520462CD00&amp;at_link_type=web_link&amp;at_campaign=Social_Flow&amp;at_format=link&amp;at_campaign_type=owned&amp;at_ptr_name=twitter&amp;at_bbc_team=editorial&amp;at_link_origin=BBCNews&amp;at_medium=social">BBC</a>, Miles Leslie said Game Pass helped convince people who were "on the fence" or "had some of that friction" to consider playing the game.
