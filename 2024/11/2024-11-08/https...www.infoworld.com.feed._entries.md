<p><a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3406501/what-is-serverless-serverless-computing-explained.html">Serverless computing</a> has had a tumultuous journey characterized by early excitement, skepticism, and challenges that some—<a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2513045/serverless-cloud-technology-fades-away.html">including yours truly</a>—believed might spell its end. However, this technology is now experiencing somewhat of a resurgence, or perhaps it is more of a forced renaissance. In other words, change or die. Perhaps it can accomplish both.</p>



<p>Let’s back up a bit. In the initial stages, serverless computing was embraced for its promise to revolutionize cloud applicatio
