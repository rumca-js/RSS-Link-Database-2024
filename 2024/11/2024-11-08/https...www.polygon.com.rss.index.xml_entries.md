<p class="has-text-align-none">The divisive <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2015/3/4/8149643/hands-on-with-the-final-version-of-the-steam-controller">Steam Controller</a> was the testing ground for some ideas (touchpads, rear buttons, haptics) that eventually found their way onto Valve’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22949326/steam-deck-review-pc-gaming-portable">Steam Deck</a>. While the company hasn’t followed up its 2015 wireless gamepad, peripheral company Hori has, in a way. The new <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DLLKRFG8">$59.99</a> wireless Horipad that’s up for pre-order at Amazon (launching Dec. 16) brandishes the Steam logo that doubles as a home button, and it’s presumab

<p class="has-drop-cap has-text-align-none">Most of the pre-release attention for Scott Beck and Bryan Woods’ A24 horror movie <em>Heretic</em> has focused on its perfect use of Hugh Grant as a polite predator. As seen in the film’s trailer, Grant plays antagonist Mr. Reed,&nbsp;a seemingly polite man who invites two Mormon missionaries (Sophie Thatcher and Chloe East) into his house for a conversation, then starts to reveal his far more inimical intentions.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The latest step in Grant’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/horror/455448/heretic-hugh-grant-villain">evolution from rom-com lead to frequent smirking villain</a> is more intelle
