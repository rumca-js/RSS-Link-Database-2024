<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>AI AI AI AI AI AI</p> <p>If you told me that your app had any production level software written by AI, first off I wouldn&#39;t believe you, because AI can&#39;t generate deployable production level code. Second, I wouldn&#39;t trust your data management and access control because AI code editors like cursor.ai and github co-pilot don&#39;t generate code with security standards in mind (even if Edward Snowden was doing your prompt engineering).Now in all fairness, I too use AI to generate code and I too deploy AI generated code to production. BUT I use security auditing software to make sure my AI generated code is actually enterprise-grade and secure-Socket.io and Ares are my stack. If you are using AI to write code YOU NEED THESE IN YOUR STACK. Ship quickly and ship securely.</p> <p>My Stack:</p> <p>Hosting- Vercel, Azure</p> <p>AI dev- Cursor, GPT</p> <p>Security- <a href="http://Ares.io">Ares.io</a>, <a href="http://Socket.io">Socket.io</a></p> <

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone, I would like learn and develop my C++ skills through a certification or a qualification. I know projects are probably the best way however I am looking for a pathway that will cover aspects that I might miss creating a project. I.e a certification would likely be more comprehensive.</p> <p>Please could you all list the best c++ certifications and why?</p> <p>I aim on becoming a HFT low latency developer in Finance soon.</p> <p>Thank you very much.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/RhiteousRhino"> /u/RhiteousRhino </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1gmobkz/best_c_qualifications_and_certifications/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1gmobkz/best_c_qualifications_and_certifications/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>ðŸ‘‹ Hey everyone ðŸ‘‹,</p> <p>ðŸŽ‰ Today is a very special day for me, Wabe this is the publish day for <strong>Wab</strong>e on <strong>Product Hun</strong>t. Around one year ago, I embarked on a solo adventure with one idea in mind: to make the process of creating an application easier and faster. I was tired of spending days recoding the same things (basic endpoints, authentication, permissions, etc.).</p> <p>Wabe is a fully open-source Backend as a Service (BaaS) in TypeScript that I designed to make developers&#39; lives easier. With Wabe, everything becomes simpler: managing authentication, database access, automatic GraphQL API generation, fine-grained permission settings, enhanced security, Stripe support, Resend (for sending emails) supports, and so much more.</p> <p>Weâ€™re only at the beginning of Wabe&#39;s journey, as many features are planned (adding a dashboard, support for PostgreSQL, and much more).</p> <p>Every line of code was crafted to pro
