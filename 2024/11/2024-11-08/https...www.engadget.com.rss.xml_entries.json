And though we\u2019ve found more and more gaming headsets that impress in terms of audio quality, those tend to cost more than a comparable set of wired headphones (which, yes, still exist). If you need to chat with friends, it\u2019s always possible to buy an external microphone and get superior sound there as well.</p> \n<p>That said, we know many people just want the convenience of a headset with a mic built right in. So after testing dozens of pairs over the past 18 months, we\u2019ve rounded up a few quality gaming headsets <em>and </em>headphones for gaming, which aren\u2019t quite the same thing. Whichever way you go, all of our recommendations should make your play time more enjoyable, no matter your budget or preferred gaming platform.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<h2 id=\"jump-li", "id": 1476521, "language": "en-US", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-gaming-headset-130006477.html?src=rss", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 104, "source_url": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2023-04%2Fa05a6150-d967-11ed-bc5f-50bcb25e8639&resize=1400%2C840&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=e4ff8354c27630b0fe73467ec1a099c3fb8788c7", "title": "The best gaming headsets for 2024", "vote": 0}]
