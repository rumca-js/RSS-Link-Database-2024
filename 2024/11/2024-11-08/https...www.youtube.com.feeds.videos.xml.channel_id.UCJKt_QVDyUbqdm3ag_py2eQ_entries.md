03:37 The Forgotten Name [New Year Remix] (1200 raw)

First track from AWE64 Gold (using 8bitbubsy's FastTracker 2.1x). GUS PnP and Amiga both weren't good with it. The remix comes from A1200 1.D4 using HippoPlayer 2.61 and its xmaplay060 option. Xmaplay060 (from 8bitbubsy) is a very accurate replayer for XM files, but sadly doesn't support CyberSound's 14-bit calibration file and has limited mixing rate (27710Hz). Still sounds good here though.
