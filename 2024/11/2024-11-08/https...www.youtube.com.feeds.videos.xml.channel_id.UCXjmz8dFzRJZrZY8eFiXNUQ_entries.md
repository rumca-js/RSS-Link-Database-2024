The Office, whether it's the original UK Version or the US Remake, is known for it's cringe inducing comedy.  Though nothing is more cringeworthy than the relationship between Dunder Mifflin Manager Michael Scott and his boss Jan Levinson.  Throughout the entire run of The Office, Michael and Jan's will they won't they was a storyline many fans wished would never come to be.  As the antithesis of Ross and Rachel on Friends, Michael and Jan gave The Office fans one of the worst couples ever put on television.   Michael Scott would eventually move on from Jan, but The Office made that timeline almost unbearable to watch.
