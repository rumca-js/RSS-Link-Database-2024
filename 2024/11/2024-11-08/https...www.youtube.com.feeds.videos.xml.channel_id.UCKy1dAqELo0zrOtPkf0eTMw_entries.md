## How Black Ops Uses Horror to Make the Best Call of Duty Campaigns

When it comes to the Call of Duty franchise, it's easy to typecast every game as the same, big blockbuster Hollywood action movie where you single-handedly save the world from this year's nuclear threat. Year after year, this clearly works for one of the best-selling franchises of all time, but the Black Ops series tends to do something different from the left-trigger, right-trigger shooting galleries the franchise is known for. From the Manchurian Candidate-inspired story of the original Black Ops—complete with numbers stations, zombies, and even a hint at who may have actually assassinated JFK—to the use of Project MK Ultra, a real-life CIA mind control project from the 1960s in Black Ops Cold War, and recently Black Ops 6’s drug-induced survival horror-like emergence mission, complete with mannequin jumpscares and zombie hordes, Call of Duty: Black Ops utilizes horror in its games to elevate the story of Black Ops into a mystery spy thriller that’s not afraid to tackle some of the

In today's Daily Fix:
Hideo Kojima's first post-Metal Gear game, Death Stranding, has been a PlayStation console exclusive since its release in 2019. It received a PC portin 2020, but it seemed like Xbox One and Series X|S were going to miss out. This morning, however, Xbox owners were pleasantly surprised to see Death Stranding appear on the Microsoft Store, and with a launch sale of 50% off. The game is being published by 505 Games, and won't be the last Kojima title to hit the Xbox: his mysterious game titled OD will arrive on the Series X|S at some point, and his espionage action game (that's not Metal Gear), Physint will hit PlayStation on its release. In other news, Warner Bros. Games has revealed another game burning a hole in its pockets: MultiVersus, the Smash Bros-esque fighter starring WB properties like Scooby-Doo, DC Comics, and more. The game apparently added $100 million in losses to the company, on top of the $200 million dud that was Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice L
