 On November 6, in response to president-elect Donald Trump's win on Election Day, Mariel Dawson, VP of marketing at Macmillan Children's Publishing Group, posted a pro-Trump graphic on her personal Facebook account. The collage image pictured X owner Elon Musk and Trump walking side by side, with an American flag background and the words "It's a Great Day to be an American." Fellow book business veterans and authors quickly raised their concerns online.
