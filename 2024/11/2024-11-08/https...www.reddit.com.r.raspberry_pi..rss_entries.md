## We wanted to save some money on GitHub Actions, so now we run builders on a Kubernetes cluster of Raspberry Pis alongside our main cloud infrastructure. I think we're onto something! Is anyone interested in trying it out and giving some feedback?

## Dollar Bill Acceptor (pulse) to Raspberrypi

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Has anyone been successful rigging up a dollar bill acceptor to a pi? I see there are some pi hats available but is really like to not have to work with a hat if not needed. Iâ€™ve been working on this for the better part of the day and nothing I do with my python script seems to be helping. I think the issue is the speed of the pulse - probably under 5-6ms - the pulse is 12vdc - witch I have an adjustable step down set up to it stepping it down to 3.2v which the pi should handle from what Iâ€™ve read. Normally open to gpio pin and common ground to ground.</p> <p>The real hitter is my script starts when unplugging and plugging back in the gpio, but not from the pulse of the dba when a dollar is inserted. </p> <p>If anyoneâ€™s had any success with this could you please point me in the right direction? Iâ€™ve seen cereal usb set ups but donâ€™t quite understand how I would go about using one.</p> <p>Thank you</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a
