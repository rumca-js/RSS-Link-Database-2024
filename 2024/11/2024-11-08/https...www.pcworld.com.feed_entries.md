<p>These days, there are finally some less expensive options for OLED gaming monitors. But if you want to save the most cash and get the best value, consider upping your initial spending to something bigger.</p>



<p>Take this oversized ultrawide from LG, for example. Though the retail price for the 39-inch OLED is an eye-watering $1,500, you can find <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LG-39GS95QE-UltraGear-DisplayHDR-DisplayPort/dp/B0CV1VL18C/">Amazon selling it for just $892.74 today</a>. That’s 40 percent off!</p>



<p>The LG UltraGear 39GS95QE is similar to a lot of smaller 34-inch gaming monitors, with a semi-standard 3440×1440 resolution that has become so popular lately. But with a generous bump up to 39 inches and a super-speedy 240Hz refresh rate, it’s a definite winner over something like the Alienware OLEDs. A generous curve and stylish base sure d

<p>Intel’s issues with 13th- and 14th-gen CPU crashes are well-documented at this point. To make a long story short: High-end chips have been crashing and failing with apparently irreversible damage, and Intel blames overzealous performance settings in the motherboard BIOS.</p>



<p>One New Yorker isn’t satisfied with Intel’s extended RMA offerings, though, and he’s suing the company in a class action.</p>



<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/11/man-sick-of-crashes-sues-intel-for-allegedly-hiding-cpu-defects/">Ars Technica reports</a> on the suit brought by one Mark Vanvalkenburgh, which alleges that Intel knew about the processors’ issues in late 2022 or early 2023 and failed to disclose them to buyers, even as return rates climbed and both end users and tech media (<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2415697/intels-crashing-13th-14

<p>When the first Ryzen 9000X chips launched, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2422628/amd-ryzen-9000-cpus-8-must-know-details-before-you-buy.html">received tepid reviews</a>, and then proceeded to stick around on retailer shelves even with immediate discounts, a lot of us thought buyers might be holding off for the X3D versions to come out.</p>



<p>It looks like we were right! (Not that it was an earth-shattering achievement of prognostication, to be fair.) As it turns out, AMD’s Ryzen 7 9800X3D is a smash hit right out of the gate, and nearly every major US retailer that sells it — including Amazon, Newegg, Best Buy, and Micro Center — is out of stock one day after the CPU’s launch.</p>



<p>There might be a few of the gaming-focused chips still hanging around physical retailers, but it looks like everything online is gone right away. It’s a sim

<p>Microsoft is getting a new feature called “Themes by Copilot,” which adds the ability to use dynamic AI-driven themes in Microsoft Outlook. You’ll need a Copilot Pro subscription to start using it, and it’s just one of the many ways AI can benefit your M365 workflows.</p>

<p>Themes by Copilot allows you to specify the types of themes you want to use in Outlook, which are then auto-generated by Microsoft’s Copilot generative AI tool. Theme designs can be based on location or weather, and the aesthetics can be in realistic, oil painting, or cartoon styles.</p>

<p>Back in 2021, when Windows 11 was first announced, there was an interesting feature called Windows Subsystem for Android (WSA) that was teased, then publicly released in 2022. WSA allows users to run Android apps directly on Windows 11 PCs.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, on March 5, 2024, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/android/wsa/">Microsoft officially deprecated the feature</a> and announced that the Amazon Appstore plus all its apps and games will stop working come March 5, 2025. If you have the Amazon Appstore or Android apps installed on your Windows 11 PC using WSA, they’ll stay operable until the deprecation date.</p>



<p>The problem is that WSA is actually quite popular, and the move to deprecate the compatibility layer <a href="https://aka.ms/AApv2ok">has been met with harsh criticism</a> on Microsoft’s Feedback Hub. According to

<p>Today, the internet has become like water and electricity, a necessity for everyday life and something we take for granted. Most people never think about routers, network cables, frequency bands, and more as long as everything works. But wireless networks — Wi-Fi — are not flawless and few users have never had problems.</p>



<p>Common problems include weak coverage in parts of the home, devices being disconnected and having to be reconnected manually, choppy music and video playback on connected devices, and slower-than-promised speeds on large downloads.</p>



<p>By optimizing your router’s settings and placement in your home, you can achieve a more stable and faster Wi-Fi network. Often this is enough, but otherwise there is help from different types of networking equipment.</p>
