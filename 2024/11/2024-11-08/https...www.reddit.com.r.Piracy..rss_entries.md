For some reason, I decided to look up the film on YouTube, and it turned out that someone had uploaded an uncut LaserDisc rip that had a much cleaner picture than anything I could find on torrent trackers. My only gripe with it was how difficult it was to download because it was age-restricted and most methods I tried (<span class="md-spoiler-text">I&#39;m not very tech-savvy</span>) don&#39;t play nice with age-restricted videos.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ignoremesenpie"> /u/ignoremesenpie </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1gmnvgi/one_of_my_best_finds_was_on_youtube_of_all_places/">[link]</a></span> &#32;
