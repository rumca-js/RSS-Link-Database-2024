I see there are some pi hats available but is really like to not have to work with a hat if not needed. I\u2019ve been working on this for the better part of the day and nothing I do with my python script seems to be helping. I think the issue is the speed of the pulse - probably under 5-6ms - the pulse is 12vdc - witch I have an adjustable step down set up to it stepping it down to 3.2v which the pi should handle from what I\u2019ve read. Normally open to gpio pin and common ground to ground.</p> <p>The real hitter is my script starts when unplugging and plugging back in the gpio, but not from the pulse of the dba when a dollar is inserted. </p> <p>If anyone\u2019s had any success with this could you please point me in the right direction?
