The script I aim to create should be able to interact with the page. Do you have suggestion of a library/framework I could use? At this point I would even use a non Python solution.</p> <p>Is there something like undetected_chromedriver but for Firefox? Sorry if it&#39;s a dumb question, but after a lot of research I still have little to no information of solutions using Firef
