When you think about Insomniac Games, the first thing to come to mind is usually Marvel's Spider-Man, followed by Ratchet and Clank. However, the studio is known for other IPs, not the least of which is Resistance. A gritty first-person shooter set in an alternate history world where humanity battles the Chimera, it started on the PS3 in 2006 and earned numerous accolades.

Resistance 2 would arrive in 2008 and make its share of changes, but 2011's Resistance 3 is where things get interesting. Despite disappointing sales, it received extensive acclaim for its story-telling, visuals, campaign, and, of course, the action. Very few trilogies end on such high notes, but Insomniac effortlessly pulled it off here.

What makes Resistance 3 so good, though? How does it stand out, even after all these years, especially when measured against other titles in the series? Find out more here. The series is probably finished, but it's worth appreciating all the same.

MachineGames has delivered consistently great games for pretty much as long as it has been around, so it is no surprise to anyone that excitement surrounding Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is as high as it is. 

It was back in 2021 that the studio was officially confirmed to be working on an Indiana Jones game, and as its release draws closer, here, we’re looking at how it is shaping up to be one of the year’s biggest games. 

Of course, having the Indiana Jones IP attached helps the game gain prominence, as does the track record and fan following of MachineGames as a studio, but the game itself has also looked increasingly promising in all that we have seen of it so far.

We've seen a couple of examples of this generation of remakes for games that aren't that old, having come out sometime in the 2010s, with many arguing that such remakes need not even exist. 

Of course, it's likely that we'll continue to see similar releases in the years to come, and though they will probably continue to be controversial, there are certain games from that period that we do want to see remakes for, even if we don't necessarily think that they're games in need of one. Here, we're going to talk about ten games that were released in the 2010s that we'd like to see remakes for.
