Shower valve installation tips with PEX A…I solder the adapter to the copper BUT you can also use press fittings. I like these Delta valves because they have the PEX A fittings installed at the factory. So it makes the installation super easy. Keep in mind, 1/2 inch PEX requires 5 to 6 expansions of both the pipe and ring 👍🏽🔥#plumbing #pex #showerremodel #bathroomremodel
