<p>Meeting comes amid fears Middle East tensions will lead Iran to redouble its efforts to acquire a nuclear weapon</p><p>Iran’s deputy foreign minister, Majid Takht-Ravanchi, will meet his European counterparts in Geneva on Friday after the collapse of a deal last week that would have seen Iran limit its uranium enrichment to 60% purity, just below the threshold to make nuclear weapons.</p><p>The offer was regarded by Iran as a first step to rebuilding confidence between Tehran and the west over what it insists is its civilian nuclear programme. There are growing fears that wider tensions in the Middle East will result in Tehran redoubling efforts to acquire a nuclear weapon and trying to declare it necessary for its national self-defence.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/24/iranian-minister-to-meet-european-counterparts-after-talks-on-nuclear-deal-collapse">Continue reading...</a>
