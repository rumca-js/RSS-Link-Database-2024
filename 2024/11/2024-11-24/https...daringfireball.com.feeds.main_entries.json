They even still have <a href=\"https://www.shazam.com/\">a standalone Shazam website</a>. I\u2019d say this has been an acquisition that\u2019s made everyone happy: existing users still have a great Shazam app, and the core \u201cWhat song is this?\u201d feature has been made more available and accessible.</p>\n\n<p>At the moment, outside Cupertino (<a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/", "id": 1577991, "language": null, "link": "https://daringfireball.net/2024/11/apple_tends_to_do_right_by_apps_it_acquires", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 29, "page_rating_contents": 90, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 489, "source_url": "https://daringfireball.com/feeds/main", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "\u2605 Apple Tends to Do Right by Apps It Acquires", "vote": 0}]
