## Amorim’s Manchester United pegged back by Ipswich after rapid start

<p>It was plainly too good to be true. Or to last. There were 82 seconds on the stadium clock when the Ruben Amorim era at Manchester United was jump-started. The new manager had put his faith in Marcus Rashford in the No 9 role and it was United’s great enigma who scored to put them in charge. Rashford charged about in the early running, a point to prove.</p><p>And yet it was the prompt for a slow retreat by United for the remainder of the first half. The structure was different, United set up in Amorim’s trademark 3-4-2-1, but the players were the same, along with plenty of the frustrations from Erik ten Hag’s tenure. It is not Amorim’s fault.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/ipswich-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The US author’s debut collection from 1934 focuses on impoverished individuals in precarious times using language that is punchy and full of compassion</p><p>Many of the 26 stories in William Saroyan’s 1934 debut collection – reissued this month with an introduction by Stephen Fry – take place in Depression-era San Francisco and explore the experiences of ordinary people trying to get by. California-born, the son of Armenians who fled the genocidal Ottoman empire, Saroyan draws on his own heritage. His narrators are often struggling young writers, such as the protagonist of the title story, who lives on a diet of “bread and coffee and cigarettes” and laments the lack of “weeds in the park that could be cooked”.</p><p>Despite the focus on poverty, there is an ebullience to Saroyan’s punchy prose. Take this opening to Seventy Thousand Assyrians: “I hadn’t had a haircut in 40 days and 40 nights, and I was beginning to look like several violinists out of work.” The story gets to the h

<p>Love, death, grief, power, revenge: Greek tragedies get to the essence of the human experience. Here, writers and artists select their favourite plays, music and films inspired by the classics, from The Hunger Games to a Santana hit</p><p>Greek myth is not a stable thing. There is no such thing as a canonical, “original” version of a Greek myth. The stories that remain to us – the material of classical plays and poetry, and of visual culture from pottery to pediments – are already elaborations and accretions. In the ancient Greek and Roman world, stories were adapted and remade to serve the needs of the moment. The Greek tragedians often took the germ of an idea from the Homeric epics, and built an entire plot from it. Aeschylus’s <em>Agamemnon</em>, for instance, is in dialogue with Homer’s <em>Odyssey</em>: both are stories of a warrior’s return from war, but with entirely different outcomes. Euripides’s subversive play <em>Helen</em> proposes that the entire Trojan war was foug

I hope you are well and enjoying the unseasonable humidity of my lungs, kidneys and blood. I’m writing today because I am likely to have housed many of you for years now and I thought it time to reach out. I just want to talk.</p><p>And first, let me make something clear, I don’t want to be thought of as a landlord. OK? I’m just a guy, just a normal little guy like you – I’m not some scary flesh monster who’ll evict you for putting up pictures (as long as you don’t leave holes in the stomach wall) or hassle you for rent.

<p>The stars enchant as young rival witches in Jon M Chu’s impossibly slick first instalment of his two-part adaptation of musical juggernaut Wicked</p><p>There’s some kind of magic afoot. If, like me, you’re one of the very few people who hasn’t already seen the blockbuster stage musical <em>Wicked</em> (it’s the second-highest-grossing Broadway show of all time, so that’s an awful lot of bums on seats), you may approach this shiny, high-energy, relentlessly marketed movie adaptation with low to moderate expectations. There’s the unwieldy running time, for a start – two hours and 40 minutes – and the cynical, box-office-gouging decision to carve the story into two films (fans will have to wait almost a year to the day before they get to watch the concluding chapter).</p><p>But here’s the thing: reservations are soon extinguished and grumbles about the release strategy swiftly quashed. <em>Wicked</em> matches its polished razzle-dazzle with real heart.

Instead of a bed of&nbsp;ice, though, we’re stretched out on heated marble. We move between three hot rooms, each resembling little chapels with vaulted ceilings, chatting quietly in the cooler one, applying face and hair masks in the middle one, and simply lying still, sweating, in the hottest one.&nbsp;Later, we will be scrubbed and massaged. In between, we cool off under a rain-mist shower, or retire to a&nbsp;bed in our own private mahogany-panelled booth beneath a glazed dome.</p><p>It sounds like a luxury spa, with prices to match.
