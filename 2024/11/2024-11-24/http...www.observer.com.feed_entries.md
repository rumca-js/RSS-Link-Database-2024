Francis Jue talks with Observer about his role in the Broadway revival of David Henry Hwang's 'Yellow Face.' "David wrote it 20 years ago, but it feels like it’s a play of today. We’re still talking about the same questions. Who should be able to decide who we are? Why can’t we decide for ourselves?"
