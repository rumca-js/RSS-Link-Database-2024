Wise\u2019s Out of the Drowning Deep, and it led to a lovely reading experience of subverted expectations. I knew it was a fantasy murder-mystery with a former addict detective, and that\u2019s it. As a fellow addict in recovery, I\u2019m sensitive to how we\u2019re portrayed in media. I expected a plot-driven mystery, some cool fantasy set pieces, and crass comic relief from an addict looking for redemption (and some dark shit considering\u00a0Grimdark Magazine\u00a0sent the book to me). After reading, though, I wanted to give a round of applause, a chef\u2019s kiss, and a hoot and a holler to A.C. Wise for the addiction plot line. The book turned out to be a through-and-through character story that I really enjoyed. Out of the Drowning Deep takes place on a solitary planet orbited by a residential space station, in a universe where all gods have made themselves known.
