It\u2018s my first post here. The title basically says it all. I have a Raspberry PI 5 and a Seeed Grove SCD30-I2C sensor for my uni-project. I\u2018m trying to read the data sent by the sensor with a python program but have failed to do so. I\u2018m fairly certain, that i plugged the sensor into the right pins (3.3V, GND, SDA, SCL) and the pi recognizes the device. Now to my problem: I tried to read the data with the python library smbus2 but they aren\u2018t interpreted correctly. I get nonsense values, mostly several thousands in the negative. I don\u2018t know what i\u2018m doing wrong or if i\u2018m even using the right library. Do you have any suggestions? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Funkhiwastaken\"> /u/Funkhiwastaken </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1gypski/need_help_with_seeed_grove_scd30_co2_sensor_and/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com", "id": 1576917, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1gypski/need_help_with_seeed_grove_scd30_co2_sensor_and", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 470, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Need help with Seeed Grove SCD30 CO2 Sensor and Raspberry PI 5", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "author": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-11-24T11:17:15+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Been having an interesting LAN stability issue.
