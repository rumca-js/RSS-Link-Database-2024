<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been following RISCV since before chips were available, so when these boards came out at reasonable price, I had to get them. But after installing Linux, I needed a project that would get me closer to the hardware and really start to understand them and, in particular, how RISCV privilege features work. Also, I believe that Jtag + GDB debugging is essential (to easily step thru code, set breakpoints and best see what is going on anywhere in the kernel). </p> <p>Although QEMU could be used for studying some of this, I really wanted to exercise the boards that I own and try to fully understand (all of) the code it is running on it. </p> <p>Linux (and even uboot) seemed too complex to really accomplish this, so I read about xv6 which has many of the same basic elements (user/supervisor modes, exception handling, virtual memory, timer and hardware interrupts etc). The OS itself is very well documented with a great Unix backstory. </p> <p>The res
