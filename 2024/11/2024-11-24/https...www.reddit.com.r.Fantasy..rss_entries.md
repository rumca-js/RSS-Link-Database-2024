<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone,</p> <p>I‚Äôm trying to remember the name of a fantasy series I read some time ago. Here‚Äôs what I can recall: - The story is set in a late medieval-inspired world, the protagonist is a lawyer who also acts as a duelist, taking part in court battles that are decided through duels. - There are incredibly detailed descriptions of weapon crafting, especially swords and bows, covering the technical aspects of the process. - A major plot point involves a faction (possibly a tribe) planning to invade the protagonist&#39;s city and uncover the secrets of sword-making.</p> <p>I‚Äôve been wracking my brain trying to remember the title, but I just can‚Äôt place it. Does this sound familiar to anyone? Any help would be greatly appreciated!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Otto_von_Pineapple"> /u/Otto_von_Pineapple </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1gz4ab3/looking_for_th

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I was oblivious to this series when it came out initially as three novellas (now combined in Los Nefilim) followed by three novels. It&#39;s historical, LGBT, fantasy fiction set immediately before the Spanish Civil War and finishing in 1939. While I haven&#39;t read the last novel what I&#39;ve read so far is really engaging. Its got a unique magic system and follows children of angels (and daimons) as they take sides in an angelic war leading to WWII. The prose is clean without filler, the characters are ones you root for, and the shark is not jumped. It was also fun when I remembered a short story that Frohock and Alex Bledsoe wrote together using the same world and one of the same characters - the Tufa meet the Nefilim. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/dmiley2952"> /u/dmiley2952 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1gyrs9c/enjoying_t_frohocks_los_nefilim_series/

## Any recommendations for MCs who are like House MD.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I love the snarky, sarcastic wit by House. I&#39;m looking for recommendations in fantasy with funny dialog (not self-aware humor), banter, and roasting. If the character is unhinged, even better.</p> <p>What i already read:</p> <p>Locke Lamora</p> <p>Warbreaker(Lightsong is House light).</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/DDeepDesign"> /u/DDeepDesign </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1gyebor/any_recommendations_for_mcs_who_are_like_house_md/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1gyebor/any_recommendations_for_mcs_who_are_like_house_md/">[comments]</a></span>

## Do you ever pretend things happened differently in a book?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Rare for me. But it&#39;s happened. Twice. A tiny part of me feels bad about it because it feels disrespectful to the author. But it happens. In my case, it&#39;s taken the form of <strong>treating sequels like they don&#39;t exist.</strong> Those sequels are conveniently a &quot;fever-dream&quot; of events without sense (I say) and therefore aren&#39;t real to me. I don&#39;t buy them to display on my bookshelf specifically to reaffirm that notion. The only time I recall them is when I come online and someone mentions them.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Vicious by V. E. Schwab</strong>: She wrote Vicious as a standalone and it shows. So I view Vicious as she initially did. Without Vengeful. (Because of Vengeful, I&#39;m wary of the new book she&#39;s written in the Shades of Magic series - I&#39;ll still look into it but only after she&#39;s written the whole series and I see what others have to say about it)</li> <li><strong>Realm of the Elderlings</strong>

## Descriptions that liken one thing to another "x was like y" that are strange

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Do any of you ever read these descriptions and pause because it seems nonsensical or you cant imagine what its supposed to look or sound like?</p> <p>I give an example: &quot;Gaz let out a laugh that sounded like a ruffle of dry leaves&quot;.</p> <p>If Gaz was some kind of a undead lich or other monster, I would understand. But Gaz is a human that as far as I can tell talks pretty normally and has no abnormal voice.</p> <p>I have no idea what such dry leaf ruffle laugh is like, but since I was listening to an audiobook, I got to hear it. If someone were to play that laugh to me and ask me to describe it, not in a million years would I have described it with dry leaves. I would bet if that sound was played to a million people and each was asked to give 10 descriptions, ruffle of dry leaves would not be on any list. Assuming none of the million people were writers.</p> <p>This is just one example but there are many similar descriptions that I come acro
