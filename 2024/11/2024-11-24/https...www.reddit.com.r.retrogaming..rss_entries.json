I was buying cheap SNES\u2019s at a local flea market to make them. They are a bit crude on the inside but everything still works today and it is the main SNES I play. Everything is to scale. The power button and reset work as they should as well. This one is mostly chechen with a walnut base. The cartridge insert is wenge, chechen, and yellowheart. The top and and bottom of the console is held together by magnets. I wanted the insides easily accessible in case something broke/needed to be replaced.

So, my brother was planning to buy a switch, mainly so his partner would be able to play some retro games through nintendo\u2019s online service. But, he doesn\u2019t quite have money for it at the moment. He\u2019s looking for a cheaper solution for retro gaming though, and that\u2019s where I want to help him. He and his girlfriend are definitely not tech savvy in any way, so I want to recommend him something that is easy to setup and very low maintenance. Basically just a machine where you can just plug and play and that is maybe around $100-$150 at most. </p> <p>Since I will be home during christmas, I will be able to help them with the initial configuration, so as long as the machine is easy to use after the setup, it\u2019s fine. I was thinking of recommending Raspberry Pi with RetroPie but it feels like it might be a bit too modular and complicated overall for people who\u2019re not used to this kind of stuff.
