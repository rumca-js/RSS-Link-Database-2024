I decided to check back in with VIP Outlet to see if their deals are still as good as last year. From a bizarre AirPods neck charger to a sealed Nexus 7 tablet, the haul this time was... interesting. Watch as I discover whether scoring these refurbished gaming deals was brilliant or a total mistake.
