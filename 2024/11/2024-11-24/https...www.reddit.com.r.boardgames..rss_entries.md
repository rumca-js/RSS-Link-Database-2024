Planted, Wingspan and Trails really check all the boxes for me and they are the type of aesthetic I love. Anybody have any suggestions? </p> <p>Also, is Parks really different enough from Trails to buy it? What are some major differences? Also I’ve seen a lot of plant themed games that look super pretty but a lot of them feel very similar in gameplay to Planted.

If I remember correctly, everybody gets 2 cars of their chosen color. They’re placed in a line 1-12 like whoever gets first, they also get last, and the person who places their car in second place, puts there car in second to last place and so on. Cards were played to move to color car that’s on the card, and if you move somebody else’s, and your car is behind them you can draft with them. Some cards would make you move to first or last, and some would make you burnout or crash(?). Maybe. Anyways if somebody knows the game, that would be very appreciated. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Etchymac"> /u/Etchymac </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1gytl80/racing_game_with_everyone_in_a_line/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span

I think it&#39;s a perfect card game, as it&#39;s somewhat challenging but easy for new people to learn, and feel like they can play effectively. </p> <p>I recently moved to a new country, and left the game at my parents&#39; house. I now want to buy a new copy for myself and cannot find it ANYWHERE!! Any suggestions or advice? I already went to two local board game stores in my city and they couldn&#39;t get it. If it helps, I currently live in France, so French/European advice would be ideal, but I also have a friend living in the USA who could send it to me if need be.</p> <p>Thanks in advance! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/
