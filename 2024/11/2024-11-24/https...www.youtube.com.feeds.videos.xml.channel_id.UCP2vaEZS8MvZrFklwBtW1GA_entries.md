Shower glass tip for curbless showers‚Ä¶never drill through curbless shower waterproofing to anchor shower glass u-channel. That‚Äôs a sure fire way to create water leaks. I use Schluter DECO-SG and bond it to the floor using mortar and KERDI-FIX. This installation is strong and works great for curbless showers. Many thanks to Schluter for providing the DECO-SG for my client‚Äôs custom shower üëçüèΩüî•#curblessshower #showerremodel #bathroomremodel #schlutersystems #brandpartner
