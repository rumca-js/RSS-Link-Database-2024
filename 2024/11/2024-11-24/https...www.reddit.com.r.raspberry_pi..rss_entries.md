<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Have a pi 3b and a pi 4 8gb I also have an 7” lcd screen and an arduino uno that I currently have a led with button mechanism on set up.</p> <p>Thing is I impulse purchased the 7 “ screen and I dunno what exactly to do with it. I was thinking of making a modular laptop with it so one of the pis I got to hook up with cases around the screen (how to src cases or diy 3d print?) and have my Bluetooth but wire capable keyboard as a quick keyboard component. A spare mouse would plug straight into the rasp pi in its case.</p> <p>I have a case for the 3b now and I’d prefer to use the 3b for the modular laptop because I’d probably only use it the laptop for typing writings and such. But </p> <p>The reason why I want to keep the model 4 pi is to make a quite up to date pi phone I need a current guides though please.</p> <p>So far I’ve hooked up a 3b to work with a monitor and such mouse keyboard etc and it works with rasp pi os. Which I’m told is python so I’m

## Need help with Seeed Grove SCD30 CO2 Sensor and Raspberry PI 5

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone! It‘s my first post here. The title basically says it all. I have a Raspberry PI 5 and a Seeed Grove SCD30-I2C sensor for my uni-project. I‘m trying to read the data sent by the sensor with a python program but have failed to do so. I‘m fairly certain, that i plugged the sensor into the right pins (3.3V, GND, SDA, SCL) and the pi recognizes the device. Now to my problem: I tried to read the data with the python library smbus2 but they aren‘t interpreted correctly. I get nonsense values, mostly several thousands in the negative. I don‘t know what i‘m doing wrong or if i‘m even using the right library. Do you have any suggestions? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Funkhiwastaken"> /u/Funkhiwastaken </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1gypski/need_help_with_seeed_grove_scd30_co2_sensor_and/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Been having an interesting LAN stability issue. Google not revealing anything with matching symptoms. Currently 4am and if I keep banging my head on this I&#39;ll need a titanium skull plate. Using a Pi 5 with 4tb NVME as a NAS for storing Steam games I&#39;m not currently playing. Setup has worked flawlessly for several months. However, the past couple days, transfers have been failing (network path not available, path not found, or IO device error reported by PC, no recognizable pattern) after 10-50GB. Restarting the transfer works at first, then fails again. I&#39;ve also noticed that the transfers &quot;hang&quot; frequently for a couple seconds at a time from start till eventual failure. </p> <p>I&#39;ve essentially ruled out hardware - tried a known good USB3 gigabit adapter on both Pi and PC, swapped in a known good router, swapped in known good cables (even moved the router and Pi to try 3&#39; cables). Same exact issue. I&#39;ve also run a 1
