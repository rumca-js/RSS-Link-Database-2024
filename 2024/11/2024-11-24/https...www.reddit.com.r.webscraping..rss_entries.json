Things to consider: </p> <p>* Residential nodes are behind routes/NAT so they can&#39;t expose ports publicly. </p> <p>* The gateway would have to be hosted somewhere e.g AWS. Maybe there&#39;s already a commercial service that allows me to connect my own nodes to it? And it just routes traffic to those nodes. </p> <p>* My goal: Looking to significantly reduce the costs of routing traffic through residential proxies ( running/owning the nodes myself is the best way to do that). Also just curious to understand ways to implement this. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.redd", "id": 1578329, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1gz0c21/how_to_build_a_residential_proxy_network", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 467, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "How to build a residential proxy network?", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "author": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-11-24T16:14:52+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Has anyone tried emailing every city/town in the US?

I&#39;ve been thinking of making it a standalone thing and not a google chrome extension, like maybe use electron or something? and you know make it more pretty and give more functionality like an ability to make your own plugins and stuff like that so just trying to get your opinions and try to catch potential clients hehe \ud83d\ude01 anyway looking forward to hearing from yall </p> </div", "id": 1575372, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1gyl0dx/a_little_project_of_mine", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 467, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "A little project of mine", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "author": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-11-24T03:27:13+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I have this project where I am asked to scrape some data about two companies.
