<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I often find myself remembering a phrase from something I&#39;ve been reading online, while forgetting which web page it came from, but search engines today don&#39;t seem to be able to find such web pages! </p> <p>For example, when I tried searching for the phrase &quot;former Confederate states are the most racist states&quot; (hoping to be pointed to <a href="https://markwadsworth.blogspot.com/2018/05/former-confederate-states-more-likely.html">this blog post</a>) neither Google, Bing nor DuckDuckGo seemed to find it: is there another search engine (perhaps one specializing in blogs) that would do the trick?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/INeedAWayOut9"> /u/INeedAWayOut9 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/searchengines/comments/1gz2upc/which_search_engine_would_be_best_for_recalling_a/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/searchengines/comments/1gz2

## is there a way to know which synonyms a search engine uses when I enter a keyword... for example, if my keyword is "collection", is there a way to know if the browser/search engine searches for "list" and "group"?
