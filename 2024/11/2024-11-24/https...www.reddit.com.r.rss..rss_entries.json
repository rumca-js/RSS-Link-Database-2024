That\u2019s all dependent on efficiency and signal to noise ratio. I\u2019ve used Feedly in the past, but the exorbitant cost makes me want to avoid it this time around. I\u2019m currently using News Explorer on IOS, and started with Lira. While I enjoyed Lira, the lack of filtering options was a deal breaker and the filtering options in News Explorer aren\u2019t any where near sufficient. Is there anything out there that has robust filtering, prioritization, and de-duplication capabilities? </p> <p>While I am a technical person, self hosting or rolling my own solution defeats the entire purpose of what I\u2019m trying to do - save time. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/septic_sergeant\"> /u/septic_sergeant </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1gyt27o/reducing_the_noise/\">[link]</a", "id": 1576930, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1gyt27o/reducing_the_noise", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 482, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Reducing the noise", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "author": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-11-24T14:41:54+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Since Top of the day is dynamic, so I want the feed to capture only once a day at a specific time and then keep doing this everyday </p> <p>I want to do this for <a href=\"/r/delhi\">r/delhi</a> which has almost 50-60 posts eveyday in top of the day when I check at usually same time once a day </p> <p>I use feedly as my rss reader </p> <p>Can someone share the feed link or guide me on how to do it ??</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Seeker_hu\"> /u/Seeker_hu </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1gysg06/feed_for_subreddit_top_of_the_day/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1gysg06/feed_for_subreddit_top_of_the_day/\">[comments]</a></span>", "id": 1576616, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1gysg06/feed_for_subreddit_top_of_the_day", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 482, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Feed for Subreddit Top of the day", "vote": 0}]
