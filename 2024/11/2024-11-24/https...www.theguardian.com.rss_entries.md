<p>Does anyone really care about a documentary charting Camilla’s rise from jolly schoolgirl to Diana’s nemesis, then queen? Channel 4 does, judging by this tedious, flimsy show</p><p>I feel like I’ve missed a memo. Is it Camilla Awareness Month or something? Two weeks ago, we had 90 minutes on her charitable activities in ITV’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/nov/11/her-majesty-the-queen-behind-closed-doors-review-compassion-cruelty-and-the-truth-about-domestic-abuse-camilla">Her Majesty the Queen: Behind Closed Doors</a> – which, to be honest, amply satisfied my interest in the lady, fond as I am of a doughty dame.

<p>Kamikaze defending aided Liverpool’s win but evolution of Dibling and Harwood-Bellis will be one to witness</p><p>For all that most people would always have considered the result an inevitability, there was little that was predictable about this game. Even once Liverpool took control in the final half-hour there rarely seemed any sense to its shifts in momentum. Like a leaf in a windstorm for long periods it tumbled gently in no particular direction, before zigging and zagging through a series of sudden, unexpected and often inexplicable turns. It was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/southampton-liverpool-premier-league-match-report">an extraordinary match</a> in a bewildering and often underwhelming way, stuffed with a combination of the surprising and the indefensible.</p><p>Two goals came from centre-backs giving the ball away, two from the penalty spot, one from an inexplicable handball, one (scored by the goalkeeper’s team) from a goalkeeping fumble,

<ul><li>England 59-14 Japan</li><li>Two tries each for Jamie George and Luke Cowan-Dickie </li></ul><p>A disappointing calendar year for England has at least ended with a flurry of tries and a healthier-looking outcome. A bucketload of points against a callow Japanese team on a blustery Sunday afternoon, however, does only so much to massage the overall bottom line. Five wins from 12 Tests – with four of the victories having come against Japan twice, Italy and Wales – tells the story of a side who look better when they face inferior opposition.</p><p>At least there were some flickers of pre-Christmas promise from the burgundy-clad hosts. There were a brace of tries apiece for England’s hookers Jamie George and Luke Cowan-Dickie while Henry Slade had a quietly excellent game in midfield but New Zealand, Australia and South Africa would all have fancied racking up closer to 80 points.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/nov/24/england-japan-autumn-nations-series-rugby-u

Then Luis Díaz retrieved Salah’s No 11.</p><p>On the face of it, at kick-off this was a mismatch between the teams top and bottom of the division but Liverpool, who opened the scoring through Dominik Szoboszlai, trailed to goals by Adam Armstrong and Mateus Fernandes.

<p>Sonia Bompastor’s extraordinary start to life in the WSL continued with a 1-0 defeat of Manchester United at Kingsmeadow. It was Chelsea’s eighth win in eight league games and opened up a five-point lead over second-placed Manchester City at the top of the WSL. Scarily, this form is coming at the beginning of the French manager’s tenure, when they should be in transition, while the players are still getting to know the former Lyon manager and her style of play.</p><p>It was a tale of two managers at Kingsmeadow, both unbeaten, one being applauded and one decidedly under pressure. After three full seasons in charge at United, Marc Skinner’s position is under almost constant scrutiny. A first defeat added to three draws puts them fifth in the league and the small “Skinner out” signs remain ever present, with fans latching on to the subtle disquiet of every recently departed player in interviews.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/chelsea-manchester-united-

<p>I’m moving house, which means coming face to face with a lifetime of mementos. I feel a burden lifting with each item I bin, donate or recycle</p><p>There is a particular sort of box that lurks in every home, full of “memorabilia” or “mementos”. Baby teeth, divorce certificates, spare keys for locks unknown, your granny’s old Padre Pio fridge magnet, the tenancy agreement for your last flat: the whole thing is rank with association, emotion, nostalgia and pain. That box is my nemesis. That box is doom.</p><p>Because I decided that turning 40, being pregnant and training for a second career wasn’t enough to be getting on with in a single month, I am also in the lucky position of moving house. Which means opening various drawers, boxes, cupboards and ring binders, only to discover a pit of painful sentimentality or logistical confusion at every turn.

<p>An apartment in the Italian city is transformed into an elegant home and showcase for natural stone interiors</p><p>In the early noughties, Gabriele Salvatori was still enduring a long commute between Tuscany, where Salvatori, the family business was launched, and Milan where the opportunities for growth lay. He was looking for a pied-à-terre and also a showroom for the company, which specialises in stone for interiors. When he saw the first-floor space he was initially hesitant because of the cramped entryway. “I called Piero Lissoni for advice and he said, ‘Are you mad? Take it, you can make it beautiful.’”</p><p>When such a renowned architect advises you to rent in a building with potential, you do it. So Gabriele took the plunge and also rented the apartment above it. This looked out on to a busy square making it noisy at times. It was also dark because it was north-facing. The location in Milan’s historic centre, however, was optimal, and in time Gabriele would move up anothe

<p>Most of us consume far too much, which can lead to high blood pressure, heart attacks and strokes. But there are some simple ways to retrain your palate and reduce your intake</p><p>Last Tuesday, I bought lunch on the go. I fancied something hot, tasty but healthy, so I chose a vegan ramen from the Japanese-inspired chain Wasabi. The soup was packed with turmeric noodles, vegetable gyozas, mushrooms, bean sprouts, pak choi, pickled ginger and sesame seeds, in a soy and miso broth. It was delicious. In fact, it was so delicious, I was suspicious. I checked out its <a href="https://www.wasabi.uk.com/menus/">nutritional information online</a>. Only 342 calories, low in saturated fat … Aha!

<p>SH Fernando Jr’s exhaustive biography of MF Doom takes us on the underground rapper’s strange musical journey from New York suburb to  Yorkshire social club</p><p>Hip-hop has no shortage of larger-than-life characters and tall tales. One of its most confounding operators was a cult underground rapper-producer most often known as MF Doom, whose death was announced at the end of 2020. Throughout his career as Doom, Dumile (pronounced “doom-eye-lay”) Daniel Thompson Jr wore a custom-made mask, fuelling his myth and safeguarding his anonymity.</p><p>Against prevailing 00s hip-hop narratives – first-hand street verité, conspicuous consumption – Doom created a stable of fantastical personae. His aesthetic was indebted to comic books, monster movies and low-rent TV soundtracks. He made mischief, sometimes sending other people to perform in his stead.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/nov/24/the-chronicles-of-doom-review-sh-fernando-unmasking-hip-hops-peerless-prankster"

Beans of every shape and size, from tiny cannellini the size of a jellybean to plump and beefy butter beans. Dried haricot and chickpeas, dry as the desert, sit patiently in glass storage jars ready to be soaked for long-cooked soups. Soft, plump butter beans and haricot in fat, screw top bottles await their moment to be turned into supper in a few minutes. There is, I like to think, a bean or lentil for every occasion.</p><p>This week, as the temperature dipped and the few remaining leaves in the garden swirled, dervish like, in the wind, the beans came out of hiding.

Right now, at the end of a day’s parenting, there’s often so little time left over that watching 35 minutes of a buzzy TV show – traditionally our favourite pastime – seems a bit pointless.

<p>In this account of his years after leaving office, Clinton is a hyperactive and loquacious presence, helping out in disaster zones and pontificating about public service – but he reveals little about his private life</p><p>American presidents are supposed to renounce pomp and disappear into private life when their term ends. George Washington enjoyed sampling the whiskey produced by the distillery at his Virginia plantation, while George W Bush currently amuses himself by clearing underbrush on his Texas ranch. Bill Clinton, aged only 54 when he left office in 2001, spurned bucolic oblivion; as he says with scriptural solemnity: “I didn’t think my work here on Earth was finished just yet.” Although he calls his memoir <em>Citizen</em> to signal his reduced status, he admits to hankering after his years as a conqueror, with military bands that struck up Hail to the Chief as his personal anthem whenever he strode into a room.</p><p>Because the presidency has grown ever more undemocr

McConnell had spent much of the previous years working in war zones and was keen to focus on something more life-affirming.</p><p>He discovered a curious landscape that was both on the frontier of human exploration and unchanged for centuries.

The number was the user count for the social media site Bluesky, the chosen distraction engine for those who can no longer stomach the toxic inanity of Elon Musk’s X. Most days, the ticker on the screen suggested the number of new Bluesky users had grown by about a million. And, of course, the newbies, inevitably myself included, revelled in the latest online promised land, a place where things would be done differently – with kindness and respect – without quite acknowledging the fact that, as yet, no platform which confuses a venture capitalist’s favourite metrics – scale! reach! influence! – with something that anyone might, say, care about, has yet avoided a descent into banal or shouty extremes.</p> <a hr

<p>Once frozen out by the New Labour elite, John Prescott fought his way in from the cold to become a loyal deputy leader. Toby Helm recalls a bruising political career</p><p>It was normally Friday evening when he would ring. There was never a “hello, how are you?” or any pleasantry like that. He just dived straight in. “What you up to for Sunday?” he would ask, meaning he had a story for me.

He tended to travel alone, so business could be transacted in total secrecy.</p><p>Once – it must have been 1994, after John Smith had died and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/tonyblair">Tony Blair</a> had become leader – I remember he suddenly broke off and roared some expletives mid-conversation which made me almost drop the phone. “What the hell was that about, I asked?” “Ohhh … Just some fucking moderniser overtaking on the inside lane,” he replied. “Bloody Mendelson [he wou

<p>Light a candle and fill your home with an upifting scent. It’s the first step to getting into the festive spirit</p><p>Something magical happens when you light candles, be it around the home or as part of a table setting. I have long argued the merits of a&nbsp;candle as a&nbsp;beauty product because it changes the ambience of a space, which changes your mood, which then, almost immediately, makes you look and feel better. (Unless of course you’re like my husband who seems to dislike all candles… But we won’t talk about that.) And so at Christmas, candles aka my essential luxuries, are a&nbsp;huge part of my festive ritual. Still, I&nbsp;learned many years ago that you must choose judiciously. It is not enough that a candle just smells nice. Those are 10 a penny. The key is to invest in a high-quality, well-made candle that has a scent most likely blended by a perfumer (all these tick that box). That way the notes blend seamlessly and are not jarring. Alas, that does mean you’ll n

The concern goes beyond foreign businesses trying to sell their products in the US. For American wine producers, it’s hard to see how the inevitable tit for tat responses in the EU and elsewhere would be anything less than disastrous for their exports, if only because their better wines are already, how to put it, kinda expensive. Certainly, the point where US wine gets really interesting is considerably higher than almost any other major wine-producing country in Europe and beyond: there is very little that causes more
