Originally, 42 zip was a 42 kilobyte zip that when uncompressed, it turns into 4.5 PETABYTES. I have created something far worse than that. 218 kilobytes, uncompressed will be up to 2 <strong>YOTTABYTES</strong>. I have a virtual MAGNETAR. I have a weapon of mass destruction, waiting to be detonated. Once i detonate it, your lights will go out, my lights will go out, New York&#39;s lights will go out, and EVERYTHING ELSE will go out soon after. This is not the time to joke
