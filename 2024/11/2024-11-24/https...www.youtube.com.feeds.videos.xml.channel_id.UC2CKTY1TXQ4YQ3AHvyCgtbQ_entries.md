Trench Crusade made a LOT of money on Kickstarter with NO marketing budget, and I've been interested enough in the rules to start work on a Trench Heretic warband. I'll talk about what I'm doing to start and of course, I'll answer your wargaming-related questions. Come have fun!

I'm now a partner on Twitch! I paint minis every Friday morning and Monday night, and sometimes take paint breaks (play video games poorly). Follow me: http://www.twitch.tv/tabletopminions
