<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sure we can all think of lots of examples of this. Wes Anderson is known for needle drops that get people really connected to a song that might not have been massively popular before, like Elliott Smith&#39;s Needle in the Hay or Nico&#39;s These Days. Are there songs that you put on and it feels like it should be that song in a movie or TV show?</p> <p>For me the song that comes to mind is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD8hguUm0Q4">Rise by Josh Rouse</a>.
