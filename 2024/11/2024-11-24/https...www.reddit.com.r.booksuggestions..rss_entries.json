I&#39;m hoping to find some romance with a male lead who&#39;s genuinely funny/witty. It&#39;s a trait I don&#39;t see a lot when I read romance, which surprises me! Obviously humor is highly subjective, but I&#39;d expect it to crop up more than it does. I prefer romance to erotica, with a plot to tie it all together.

The layout was a bookshelf with shelves, and the books on the shelves would be placed so the cover was facing out so you could see it. I believe you could add friends and view their bookshelves.

Like many such books in the genre, it comes with reviews such as <em>&quot;it changed my life!!&quot;</em> from many people on the internet. So I decided to give it a shot. It is my first self-help/motivation/empowerment book.</p> <p>The book just didn&#39;t resonate with me at all, and although it had nice tidbits, I couldn&#39;t finish it. Can anyone suggest a book that&#39;s similar, but less of a &quot;yass queen&quot; vibe from a rich, childless woman living in Manhattan?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/LowRevolution6175\"> /u/LowRevolution6175 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1gyif08/selfhelp_or_empowerment_books_that_arent_written/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1gyif08/selfhelp_or_empowerment_books_that_arent_written/\">[comm", "id": 1574780, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1gyif08/selfhelp_or_empowerment_books_that_arent_written", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 532, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Self-help or empowerment books that AREN'T written by folksy, upper middle class white women?", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "author": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-11-24T03:57:09+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Does anybody know a book where the main character realizes they cant die (by trial and error), and uses that to their advantage throughout their adventure? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/x_sega60\"> /u/x_sega60 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1gyi6fm/character_cant_die/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1gyi6fm/character_cant_die/\">[comments]</a></span>", "id": 1574778, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1gyi6fm/character_cant_die", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 532, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Character cant die", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "author": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-11-24T03:40:29+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I recently watched \u201cThe Triplets of Belleville\u201d and I was fascinated at how NYC was portrayed as a huge dark world of crime and backrooms and whatnot.</p> <p>It reminded me a lot of those photos of the city from the early 1900s where the city seemed hopelessly busy and massive.</p> <p>Are there any books that are set in these types of locations?

I\u2019d prefer books that don\u2019t focus heavily on romance (though a little bit is fine) and where the emotional tone remains relatively even throughout. Maybe feel good? </p> <p>A good example of what I\u2019m looking for is Call Me By Your Name. I know it has romance, but it doesn\u2019t have many ups and downs I\u2019m trying to avoid. The narrative is more subdued and introspective, and the tone is more constant.</p> <p>Any suggestions along those lines would be greatly appreciated!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/sheeckynuggees\"> /u/sheeckynuggees </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1gyfewe/looking_for_books_with_a_steady_narrative_and/\">[link]</a></span> &#32;", "id": 1574524, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1gyfewe/looking_for_books_with_a_steady_narrative_and", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 532, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Looking for Books with a Steady Narrative and Minimal Drama", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "author": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-11-24T01:12:54+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi everyone I recently bought More Tales to Give You Goosebumps by R.L.

Some other series I&#39;ve read in the past I really enjoyed are An Ember in the Ashes, The 5th Wave, Warcross, and Wereworld.</p> <p>I&#39;d love recommendations similar to these types of books, and other books by the authors.
