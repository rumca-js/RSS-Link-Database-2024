Stone Age still being a very (the most?) popular gateway game for worker placement, and Agricola Family Edition having seemingly vanished from the conversation. I own the latter, and it&#39;s been reasonably popular. I&#39;m wondering if Stone Age brings anything more/better to the table at this level, such that I should seek it out and/or replace Agricola FE, or just focus on getting the kids up to the next level (we have Viticulture EE/Tuscany, Lost Ruins of Arnak, Dune Imperium, and Star Wars Outer Rim for that matter :D ) Something like Caverna could be in the offing at some point ... we do have New York Zoo, but I find it a little boring and lengthy once you get past the theme and meeples.</p> <p>Kids are 8 and 13. 8 year old actually won a game of Istanbul the Dice Game against her mother and me (but with a", "id": 1485412, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1gngczy/stone_age_vs_agricola_family_edition_owned_kids_8", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 473, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Stone Age vs Agricola Family Edition (owned) (kids 8 and 13)", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-11-09T18:17:05+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Just thinking about this due to watching people get so serious about stats, but it doesn&#39;t apply to stat people specifically cause I don&#39;t track stuff.</p> <p>Do people play games multiple times enough to....get better at all?
