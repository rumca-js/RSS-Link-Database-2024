<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’m looking at a surprise gift for my husband and I can’t decide whether I should get him X1C or get P1S and spend the extra cash for accessories/spools etc. He currently has a starter 3d printer from Elegoo and this will be an upgrade. </p> <p>What is your experience with P1S/X1C (pros/cons)? Is it worth spending extra money on the fancier kind? This will be for home/hobby use. Any opinion is appreciated!!
