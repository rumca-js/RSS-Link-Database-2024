<p>In this review, we're taking a look at the new paint sets from the guys at Squidmar, each containing a mix of 12 of the new Vallejo Game and Model Colors. The curated colour palette is tailored to Emil and Lukas' tutorial videos, and in addition to the paints, you get an exclusive hard plastic miniature with each set.
