<p>Manchester City are faltering, Liverpool are flawless. The Premier League leaders took full advantage of the reigning champions’ defeat at Brighton to extend their lead at the top to five points with a confident, clinical defeat of Aston Villa. It was Liverpool’s 15th victory in 17 matches under Arne Slot and they head into the international break with momentum, belief and form on their side.</p><p>A first-half strike from Darwin Núñez and a late finish from Mohamed Salah secured victory over Unai Emery’s stubborn side, who lacked the quality in the final third to seriously trouble Liverpool. Liverpool have bettered their tally of 28 points from the opening 11 games only once in the last 34 seasons, in 2019-20, when they went on to win the Premier League.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/09/liverpool-aston-villa-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Four exhibitions in London this autumn remind us that creativity and imagination are the opposite of authoritarianism</p><p>There can rarely have been such a meeting of political jeopardy and artistic genius as in Florence in 1504. After the violent overthrow of the Medici family a decade earlier, and the execution of the zealot Savanorola in 1498, the new Florentine government, beset by ongoing wars with Pisa, was desperate for symbols to help stabilise the city’s fragile republic. To that end, Niccolò Machiavelli, the minister whose name has become synonymous with such political scheming, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2024/nov/05/michelangelo-leonardo-raphael-review-bitchy-da-vinci-conquers-the-army-of-gnarly-nudes">was among those</a> instrumental in bringing the two towering artists of the age, Leonardo da Vinci, then 52, and Michelangelo, 23 years his junior, into direct competition to create those public statements, to help make Florence great again.</p><

When her best friend, the acclaimed Swedish writer Johanna Ekström, became terminally ill with cancer, Rausing promised to complete her last book. She edited the 13 handwritten notebooks, adding her own commentary. <em>And the Walls Became the World All Around</em> (Granta), which Rausing has now translated into English, is a brave and beautiful memoir of Ekström’s final two years, and a moving meditation on grief and friendship. It was a bestseller in Sweden, where it was first published&nbsp;last year.

Seeking an alternative, he shifted his attention to a solitary crow perched on a car by the&nbsp;university’s Parkinson Building.</p><p>“Photography is implanted in my life,” says Baker, a final-year photography student at Leeds Arts University, just across the road. “My&nbsp;dad is the reason I&nbsp;became so passionate about it. He documents everything – we have a shed full of stupid cameras that don’t&nbsp;work. Whenever we had a moment, it wasn’t, ‘Let’s get together and take a family photo’ – the camera was already out.” This image of a stark black crow against ivory bricks is a departure from Baker’s usual monochrome portraiture.

In person, he had a professorial air because he was once, in fact, a professor, teaching English and the humanities at various north-eastern colleges before picking up a 16mm camera. He would turn The Hills Have Eyes into a cannibalistic shocker that doubled as a stark class critique and give the villainous couple of The People Under the Stairs the unmistakable echo of Ronald and Nancy Reagan. He understood as well as anyone how horror could be a vessel for larger themes, so long as it delivered the goods.</p><p>Forty years ago, Craven hopped aboard the slasher movie tren

If she did not finish the Transat CIC, she would fail to qualify for the 2024 Vendée Globe, the round-the-world race that takes place every four years. But there was a crack in her bulkhead more than four metres long. This was not about racing any more, it was about surviving.</p><p>“It’s always super humbling,” Crémer says, recalling her emotions that day. “Sailors are competitive people, we like to push ourselves and the boat hard, but suddenly you realise you’re just on a very small boat in the middle of a big ocean and the amount of water around you is infinite.”</p> <a href="https:/

We needed to prioritise her weight over healthy eating, said the dietitian. It was mission Calories Over Carrot Sticks.

<p>The cast are so incredible that even the bit parts feel like stars of the future. Peter Kosminsky’s rich, clever adaptation of Hilary Mantel’s novels needs to be plunged into without distraction</p><p>It has been nine years since the first blockbuster run of Wolf Hall shot complete unknown “Mark Rylance” to critical and commercial acclaim, and a smarter TV columnist who pays more attention to geopolitics would draw out a doomed attempt at a metaphor here. One about how the world has so drastically changed since 2015 – all those prime ministers and monarchs and presidents, and also Brexit and Bake Off going to Channel 4 – and I’d nod at the returning treacle-moving drama of court intrigue and everyone caring slightly too much about blood and go: “See? It’s like that, isn’t it. It’s all sort of like that.” That’s the kind of thing writers who get tie-in TV podcasts say in their opening&nbsp;paragraphs, and I would quite like one of those.</p><p>Sadly, I think Wolf Hall: The Mirror a
