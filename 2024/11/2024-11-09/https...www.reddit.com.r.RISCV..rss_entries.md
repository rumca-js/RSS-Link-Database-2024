## Why is there still so much FUD with RISC-V?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m trying to get RISC-V supported by more projects and package managers. However, I&#39;ve noticed they largely respond with baseless FUD regarding it. I also see this FUD in places like <a href="/r/hardware">r/hardware</a> and <a href="/r/android">r/android</a>.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>WCH has released the documentation and SDK for a new MCU intended for motor control applications, the CH32M030. Quote from the data sheet:</p> <blockquote> <p>The CH32M030 series is an industrial-grade motor microcontroller designed based on the Qingke RISC-V3B core. The CH32M030 has four built-in OPA op amps and three voltage comparators CMP, which can be combined into two groups of AC small signal amplifier decoders QII and two groups of differential input current sampling ISP; built-in USB PHY and PD PHY, supporting USB Host and USB Device functions, PDUSB, Type-C fast charging functions, BC1.2 and DCP/CDP and other high-voltage charging protocols; built-in 4 pairs of N-type power tube gate pre-drivers, providing high-voltage I/O; built-in programmable current injection module; provides DMA controller, 12-bit analog-to-digital conversion ADC, multiple groups of timers, UART serial ports, I2C, SPI and other peripheral resources, providing overvolta

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m considering buying a RISC-V board, and one of the major considerations I have is how open (as in FOSS) the platform I buy will be. I know RISC-V is FOSS, but that&#39;s just the ISAâ€”if I buy a SiFive P550, is the hardware design open-source? If not, is it subject to copyright or parent restrictions or the likes?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ringsig"> /u/ringsig </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1gn0ag4/how_open_is_sifive_ip/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1gn0ag4/how_open_is_sifive_ip/">[comments]</a></span>
