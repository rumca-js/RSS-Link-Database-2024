Towers Of Aghasba Gameplay FIRST LOOK - Evolution of OPEN WORLD Survival
Towers of Aghasba, developed by Dreamlit Games, is an indie title that takes an approach to open-world gameplay by combining exploration, civilization building, and ecosystem management. Slated for Early Access on November 19, 2024, on PlayStation 5 and PC, the game takes players to a fantasy island thatâ€™s fallen to ruin due to a force known as the Withered. Aghasba, which was once a lively and flourishing place, is now in a very decayed state. Players are tasked with revitalizing the island by restoring plant life, attracting wildlife, and building a civilization that strikes a balance with nature.
