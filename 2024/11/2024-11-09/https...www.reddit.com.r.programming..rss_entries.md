<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been working on a tool called Less that automates the creation and deployment of serverless components to AWS. No AWS or Cloud experience is necessary at all and there is almost no learning curve. For those of you that do grasp AWS concepts we are creating an API Gateway with Lambda functions behind the scenes.</p> <p>If you check out the video and/or docs and share your feedback I would greatly appreciate it. You can also learn how to create Web Sockets, Topics/Subscribers, CRON Jobs, and much more in the docs.</p> <p>Very much looking forward to your thoughts!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/chuva-io"> /u/chuva-io </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOKJWdhcbio">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1gnlyoj/deploy_serverless_nodejs_rest_api_to_aws_in_5/">[comments]</a></span>

Most of the early sections have challenges students can do to test their understanding of the topics covered and for practice. I&#39;ve shifted my focus away from these to make more progress on the main content of the book. Any assistance would be appreciated.</li> <li>Theming. A lot of the chapters are...bland. Purely technical. I find that when I have the imagination to &quot;theme&quot; the subjects they become higher quality and more engaging overall.
