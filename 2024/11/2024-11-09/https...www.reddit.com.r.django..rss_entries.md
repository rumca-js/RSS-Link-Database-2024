<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m developing a Django application that requires a persistent WebSocket connection to continuously fetch live data from a crypto market API. I need to keep this WebSocket connection active throughout the application&#39;s lifecycle to update my local data as new information arrives. This updated data will later be displayed on the front end, so I anticipate needing a separate WebSocket connection between the front end and back end (one connection for backend-to-crypto market API, and another for backend-to-frontend).</p> <p>I&#39;m new to this type of setup and would appreciate guidance on the best practices for implementing it.

Although Django Channels might be suitable for the frontend-backend WebSocket connection, I&#39;m more focused on maintaining a robust event-loop structure for the backend-to-crypto API connection to ensure it remains alive and responsive. I&#39;m considering buildi

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>hi, my name is Joel , I am a uk based software engineer.</p> <p>I have been working on an idea, using JS and a REST API in Django. the general gist of it is that it is using the canvas and added in functionality to allow users to design a functional webpage where they can choose buttons and redirects make queries and send and receive data, and use stripe to sell subscriptions or products. Basic website stuff. the webapp would include this, but also a team dashboard and hub for people to collaborate and find people who would be interested in making these webpages for business purposes. I&#39;m thinking of letting the custom webpages leverage google maps for increased utility. I also would like to add GPT assistance features for if people want to use them on there custom webpages</p> <p>Is this all too much for one application? any feedback would be appreciated.</p> <p>I&#39;m also open to any interested to help me out on what&#39;s left of the project
