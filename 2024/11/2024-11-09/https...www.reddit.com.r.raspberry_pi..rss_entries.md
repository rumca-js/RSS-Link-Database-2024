<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’m trying to set up my Zero 2 W to launch chromium in full screen at startup to just display a website. I have everything figured out except for how to disable chromium from displaying the “It is not recommended to run Chromium on devices with less than 1GB of ram” warning. I can’t seem to find anything on google for this, and my programming knowledge is essentially zero. Any help would be much appreciated</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Javamonsoon"> /u/Javamonsoon </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1gnbhzs/need_help_with_launching_chromium_on_zero_2_w/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1gnbhzs/need_help_with_launching_chromium_on_zero_2_w/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all,</p> <p>For a project I would like to multiplex 4 Camera Module 3 cameras onto 1 single output. This output would then be connected to a Raspberry Pi to process the image data. I have 2 problems however:</p> <ol> <li><p>The Camera Module 3 doesn&#39;t natively support synchronous capture according to the documentation. The HQ and GS camera do, but since these are both more expensive, I would prefer avoiding them. Is there any way to still allow synchronous capture? Perhaps through software or custom hardware?</p></li> <li><p>I have searched a little bit online and can&#39;t really find a 4-to-1 multiplexer for CSI-2, D-PHY (used protocol). How would I go about doing this? put the captured images in a buffer and then multiplex them using time-division-multiplexing?</p></li> </ol> <p>Any help is more than welcome, thanks! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/oiledupbuttflaps"> /u/oiledupbuttflap

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello everyone!</p> <p>I am trying to setup my Raspberry Pi 3B as an access point. I have prepared a fresh install and I am accessing it with SSH through a wired connection. After running sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt ugprade -y, I followed <a href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/documentation/blob/develop/documentation/asciidoc/computers/configuration/host-wireless-network.adoc">this</a> guide and I ran the first command, providing a network name and a password.</p> <pre><code>sudo nmcli device wifi hotspot ssid &lt;example-network-name&gt; password &lt;example-password&gt; </code></pre> <p>After executing that I could see the new network in my phone&#39;s list, in the available networks, but as I try connecting it simply doesn&#39;t connect. I have triple checked the password, thinking I may have fatfingered, but I didn&#39;t.</p> <p>What could be the curlprit?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/
