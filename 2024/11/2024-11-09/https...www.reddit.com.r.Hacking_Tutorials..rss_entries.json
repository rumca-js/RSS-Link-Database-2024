It allows you to see the gender of pokemon, and if they are shiny, in the gen 1 virtual games on your 3DS. I installed CFW on my 3DS to get luma, patched the gb and gbc files for pokemon red and yellow with the required ips files, puy them on my 3DS SD card, and enable the patch on Luma, but it keeps crashing the games.</p> <p>When I run the patched files on an emulator on my laptop they run perfectly, so I am pretty sure it&#39;s something about connecting the patched ROMs to the virtual games. If anyone can offer advice I&#39;d really appreciate it.</p> <p>This is the link which has the guide I tried to follow <a href=\"https://x.com/norainthefuture/status/1718090715056472329?lang=en\">https://x.com/norainthefuture/status/1718090715056472329?lang=en</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> ", "id": 1485062, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking_Tutorials/comments/1gnefme/trying_to_add_a_patched_rom_to_my_virtual_pokemon", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 535, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking_Tutorials/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Trying to add a patched ROM to my virtual pokemon red and yellow on 3DS", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-11-09T14:10:11+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Weekly forum post: Let&#39;s discuss current projects, concepts, questions and collaborations.
