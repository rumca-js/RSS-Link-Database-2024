The depiction of this character has offended Indigenous people across Australia.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So, I was inspired by <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gn17o7/characters_who_fascinate_you_and_make_you_feel/">this recent post</a> and decided to pose a similar question: </p> <p>What are some characters that made you love them because they reminded you of someone close to you, or someone you admired or loved? </p> <p>I&#39;ll share mine: There is a book called &quot;Little, Big&quot; by author John Crowley. One of the characters is a young man named Auberon, who has a complicated relationship with his father. Auberon is a quiet child who keeps a lot to himself. This causes a sort of rift between him and his father (who I see a lot of myself in). So many of Auberon&#39;s mannerisms, experiences, actions, etc. are very similar to my youngest son&#39;s. We all ache when our children have their hearts broken. We all worry when they set off into the big scary world. Of all the characters in literature, I think I love Auberon the most be

The convenience of being able to read on your phone or tablet cannot be overstated, but the classic feel of a leather or plastic cover and real pages seems hard to replace. </p> <p>There are various examples of how the medium matters for each individual, but I&#39;m curious about <strong>YOUR</strong> perspective and <em>unique</em> reasoning.</p> <p>Do you perhaps think sitting in a library while reading on your phone is just as relaxing or enjoyable as picking a real book off the shelf?

Looking for ideas. </p> <p>Besst served cold by Joe Abercrombie</p> <p>I&#39;ve read all of his first law stuff loved all of it and am fairly biased but that book I have no critiques. I might put a little hatred in there too.</p> <p>Calibans War 2nd book in the expanse series</p> <p>This book was perfect. The pacing the characters the story the stakes just amazing. However in this case I wasn&#39;t a big fan of the first book but had the second and it is a contender for top sci fi. </p> <p>Thanks for your input </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Herpthethirdderp"> /u/Herpthethirdderp </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gnevqw/10_out_of_10_books_reccommdations/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit

## Characters who fascinate you and make you feel the most intense or complex feelings?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>By most intense, I mean someone who makes you feel very strong feelings (e.g., hating them with a passion). And by complex, I Mean someone who triggers a combination of very different emotions, like anger but also love.</p> <p>What happened was that I was having a chat with a fellow reader who said he likes Of Mice and Men, in particular Lennie Small, for whom he feels only one thing: Sorrow. He pities the guy. That&#39;s it. Kind of like how he feels about animals because they are innocent. </p> <p>I appreciate that perspective and at times I do feel the same way, being drawn to characters who don&#39;t trigger too many feelings in me. </p> <p>Sometimes those feelings can be intense though. Like Palpatine in Star Wars. You just feel negative feelings toward the guy. And hate him with a passion.</p> <p>But I feel that more realistic characters usually trigger a combination of different feelings. That is how a friend described her feelings toward Heat
