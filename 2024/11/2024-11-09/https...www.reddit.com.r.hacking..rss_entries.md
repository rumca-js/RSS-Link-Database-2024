<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Is there a way the computer did this on its own? I left my computer on in Windows and when I came back it was open in BIOS. I lock my room but it’s easy to open with a card. What other ways could this have happened? Don’t want to jump into accusing my roomates right away. I just ran a Kaspersky rootkit analysis and nothing came back.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/nineusername"> /u/nineusername </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1gnigcv/i_went_out_and_when_i_came_back_my_computer_was/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1gnigcv/i_went_out_and_when_i_came_back_my_computer_was/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Apologies if this isn&#39;t the best place. I don&#39;t really know anything about hacking, or the scene. But in regard to the massive pokemon leak that just took place. Most of the material that the hacker got their hands on isn&#39;t going to be released, and I&#39;m wondering why.</p> <p>Is the point to get a payday from Game Freak\ Nintendo? i.e. release a little bit to prove legitimacy and intent, then ransom the rest? Or is there another reasons?</p> <p>TIA</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/LightsOnTrees"> /u/LightsOnTrees </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1gn6q6m/pokemon_1tb_leak_what_were_the_motivations/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1gn6q6m/pokemon_1tb_leak_what_were_the_motivations/">[comments]</a></span>
