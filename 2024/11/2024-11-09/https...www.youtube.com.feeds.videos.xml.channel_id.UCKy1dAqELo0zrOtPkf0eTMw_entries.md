Dragon Age The Veilguard is out and while the series’ rabid fans (myself included) are diving headfirst into the fourth mainline installment of the franchise, newcomers may be feeling a little baffled about where to start. Who’s Solas, the Dread Wolf? What’s the Fade? What is the Evanuris? We’ll try to answer all that and more of what you can expect to hear about in DATV. 

This is a crash course on lore that pertians to The Veilguard, and we’ve condensed and omitted certain story events for the sake of time. We won’t be covering every single event in minute detail, but just enough so you can dive in to DAV prepared with everything you need to know about darkspawn, the Blight, Thedas and more.

Arcane Season 2 Acts I and II, reviewed by Rafael Motamayor. Narrated by Alan Wheeler.

We'll have to wait to see how Act III resolves the many plot threads as well as where the characters end up, but for now, the first six episodes of Arcane season 2 build on the masterpiece that was season one. Piltover may be on the brink of war, but it's the individual characters where the series excels, pairing a stellar voice cast with stunning animated acting. With fascinating worldbuilding, larger-scale action, and animation that continues to push boundaries, this is a more-than-worthy follow-up.
