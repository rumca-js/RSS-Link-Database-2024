2023 was somewhat of a year of recovery for Microsoft’s first-party efforts, with the likes of Hi-Fi Rush, Starfield, and Forza Motorsport restoring some faith after what had been a disastrously dry 2022, though in 2024, it feels like Xbox Game Studios’ output has slipped back once again.

With a hand-crafted 60+ square kilometre map, players can encounter various characters, random events, Stalker stashes, terrifying mutants, Anomalies, and more.
