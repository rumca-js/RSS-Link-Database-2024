PlayStation 5 Pro arrives complete with a somewhat enigmatic feature - the ability to enhance the image quality of older PS4 software. A toggleable menu option suggests that the new console has the ability to 'improve the resolution of select PS4 games' but there's no explanation of what it actually does. With that in mind, we set out to find out. What exactly does the 'enhance image quality' feature actually do? Is this a game changer for PS5 Pro, or more of an incremental improvement?

Welcome back to our regular feature where we write a little bit about some of the games we've been playing over the past few days. This week, we're nostalgic for how Agatha Harkness <em>used</em> to play in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/marvel-snap">Marvel Snap</a>, we're unexpectedly bowled over by a new Smurfs game, and we finally find a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/vampire-survivors">Vampire Survivors</a> clone good enough to stand on its own.

Arcane is a wonderful series, obviously beautiful but also deeply earnest. This show is unafraid to feel things, and feel them <em>hard</em>.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arcane-season-2-review">Read more</a></p>
