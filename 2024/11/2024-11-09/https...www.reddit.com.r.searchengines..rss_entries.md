<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;d prefer an engine more based on science. Apparently in 2024 this is incredibly difficult. For example, when I search &quot;can men get pregnant&quot;, I don&#39;t want the top answer to be wrong; &quot;yes&quot;, followed by hidden unconventional qualifiers like &quot;If they&#39;re trans&quot;. </p> <p>Sorry to all the troll-like haters to come, but if I&#39;m asking a search engine something as basic as &quot;can men get pregnant&quot; I want science-based results rather than results based on a social construct meant to fulfill an agenda. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/bizurton"> /u/bizurton </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/searchengines/comments/1gmzgzv/any_based_search_engines/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/searchengines/comments/1gmzgzv/any_based_search_engines/">[comments]</a></span>
