<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey <a href="/r/Games">r/Games</a>!</p> <p>I&#39;m Peter Tamte, CEO of the company making and publishing Six Days in Fallujah. We just released our &quot;Command and Control&quot; Update this past Thursday, on the 20th anniversary of the Second Battle of Fallujah.</p> <p>Six Days was conceived by a Marine who was badly wounded in the battle. It was cancelled back in 2009 due to controversy and then revived a few years ago. By letting you participate interactively in the true stories of the dozens of Americans and Iraqis who&#39;ve helped us make this game, we hope to present a far more realistic look at war, as well as the events in 2004 that shaped so much of how our world works right now.</p> <p>Release trailer: <a href="https://youtu.be/UiX2tMJ_gYA">https://youtu.be/UiX2tMJ_gYA</a></p> <p>Discord: <a href="https://discord.gg/SixDaysGame">https://discord.gg/SixDaysGame</a></p> <p>I&#39;d like to share context around our content update, as well as w

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>If I own Helleivers 2 on Steam, and it’s just a seat license and I don’t actually “own” the game, and I have to have a PlayStation account in addition to a Steam account, why does that clearly valid license tied to my PSN not also unlock the game on my PS5? Why doesn’t my personal, and according to Sony account level worthy license, apply to my PS5 or potential PS5 Pro purchases? Why do I have to pay Sony an additional $40+$7/mo PSN sub to play Helldivers 2 on my PS5 when I already purchased a license on Steam?</p> <p>I genuinely don’t understand: it’s unlocked at account level by Sony’s insistence, so then unlock it everywhere I can use the software license.
