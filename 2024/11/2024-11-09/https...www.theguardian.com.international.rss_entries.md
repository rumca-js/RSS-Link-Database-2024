However, in her short career, the American’s grit has been a constant resource when all else has failed. She has found a way to victory from dire circumstances so many times.

<p>Now 77, the playwright who has chronicled British life for 50 years, says he is stepping up his work rate as he has limited scope to tell important stories</p><p>Sir David Hare has charted the forces and habits shaping British life for more than half a century, on stage and on screen. His work for cinema stretches from the 1985 film of his play <em>Plenty</em>, starring Meryl Streep, to his screenplays for <em>Damage</em>, <em>The Hours</em> and 2016’s <em>Denial</em>. And his string of theatrical “state of the nation” accounts of political and moral dilemmas, with hits such as <em>Pravda</em>, starring Anthony Hopkins, <em>The Absence of War</em>, starring John Thaw, and <em>Amy’s View</em>, with Judi Dench, have regularly set the cultural agenda.</p><p>But now, at 77, Hare has revealed he is to seriously step up his work rate because he fears that, for him, it is already “five minutes to midnight” and so he has limited scope remaining to tell important stories.</p> <a href="http

<p>Wolves’ survival hopes and Gary O’Neil’s job security are intrinsically linked to the form of Matheus Cunha. The Brazilian created one and scored another against Southampton to secure a first league victory of the season and take the pressure off his manager for the time being at least.</p><p>Cunha was the difference between two underwhelming sides, who can boast one win each after 11 matches. Southampton’s problem is scoring goals and they brought a rubber spoon to a knife fight to hand Wolves a first Premier League clean sheet of the season as they doubled their points tally thanks to Pablo Sarabia and Cunha.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/09/wolves-southampton-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Landscape and architecture photographer <a href="https://www.vincenzopagliuca.com/">Vincenzo Pagliuca</a> was always fascinated by the empty, isolated houses scattered around the Campania region of southern Italy where he grew up. Since 2016 he has travelled along the Apennine mountain range that runs almost the length of the country, photographing uninhabited rural houses and abandoned holiday homes linked to ski tourism – now unused due to lack of snow. These images, collected in the book <em>Mónos</em>, were shot during the winter months to capture the particular quality of the light. “A house immersed in a winter landscape, even more so in its isolated state, evokes an ancestral sense of shelter and protection,” says Pagliuca. “It becomes an archetypal image of intimacy, inviting us to reflect on the psychological significance of home for human beings.”</p><ul><li><a href="https://hartmann-books.com/en/produkt/vincenzo-pagliuca-monos-2/">Vincenzo Pagliuca’s </a><em><a href="ht

A inch-perfect forehand from Gauff, then Zheng hits long to give Gauff two break points. Zheng saves the game with a perfectly balanced cross court winner then a backhand down the line.

<p>The Gunners got in early to land William Saliba for £25m – Chelsea later signed his teammate Wesley Fofana for £70m</p><p>It was a cold, rainy afternoon in Montpellier when Arsenal first became serious about William Saliba. This was 2019, before the scouts, agents and rival clubs would descend en masse. He was playing for Saint-Étienne’s under-19s and Ty Gooden, then Arsenal’s France scout, had alerted them to the raw yet impressive 6ft 4in 18-year-old working his way through the ranks. His insistence had brought Francis Cagigao, then the club’s head of scouting, to the south of France.</p><p>Cagigao and Gooden initially had their eye on another centre-half at Saint-Étienne, a year older and already in the first team. He will also be playing on Sunday at Stamford Bridge, against Saliba. Indeed, the older centre-half would eventually command a £70m transfer fee. However, it was Saliba’s extraordinary speed and presence that attracted the Arsenal duo over Wesley Fofana.</p> <a href=

<p>A stirring performance by Víkingur Ólafsson of a piano concerto written amid a period of great sorrow. I think we could relate</p><p>On Wednesday evening, I went to the Royal Festival Hall on London’s Southbank Centre to hear the Icelandic pianist, Víkingur Ólafsson, play Brahms’ <em>Piano Concerto No 1</em>, the tickets for which I’d booked aeons ago, in ignorance of the future significance of the date. Ólafsson’s marvellous name conjures someone ruggedly bearded, a tame puffin or guillemot perhaps sitting on the shoulder of his tufty jumper, when in fact he looks more like one of the cast of <em>Mad Men</em>. But either way, to see him on stage is incredibly exciting. He plays with such fervour, leaning into the orchestra whenever his fingers are idle, his body like a flag in high wind.</p><p>Ólafsson’s encore was immaculately well judged. “This is a prayer for the world,” he said, before giving the crowd his version of <em>Ave Maria, </em>composed by his countryman Sigvaldi Kal

<p>The best literary comfort reads rebuild our strength so we can face reality, argues novelist Francesca Segal. She picks her ultimate reading list – with help from Nick Hornby, Sathnam Sanghera and Naomi Alderman</p><p>“Life is short and the world / is at least half terrible,” <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/89897/good-bones">observes</a> the poet Maggie Smith. But which are the books to reach for when the terrible half is in the ascendant? I’ve come to treasure a&nbsp;particular category I’d define as the literary comfort novel: elegant and beautifully written stories that renew our faith in humanity, that leave us better than they found us, that work – and thus expand – the muscle of the heart. Lately, I’ve come to realise that I want to read one story: <em>despite everything, it&nbsp;is going to be OK</em>.</p><p>That “despite” is key. Solace is distinct from escape, and I’d define a&nbsp;literary comfort novel as distinct from pure escapism. I don’t want the nar
