I am using the new reeder app. There does not appear to be rss built into the site innately, or at least if there is, reeder doesnt notice it. So I tried Killthenewsletter. However, when I try to add the xml link from there into Reeder, once again, it does not recognise it. I can get it to kind of recognise it by adding it to Old Reeder and then exporting as an OPML and then importing into new Reeder, but even then, despite showing up in the lists, no newsletters/emails ever come through. Does anyone know if I am doing something wrong, if the new Reeder doesn&#39;t support atom, or if Kill the Newsletter might be dead or something? Any alternatives or tips would be greatly appreciated, thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/gravity_squirrel\"> /u/gravity_squirrel </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments", "id": 1483936, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1gn9g6n/kill_the_newsletter_and_reeder", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 482, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Kill the Newsletter and Reeder", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-11-09T08:02:56+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Last year, I built an OPML editor that offered easy editing workflow for OPML files that was mobile-friendly, no sign-ups, nothing to install, just a free online utility where you open and edit from anywhere.
