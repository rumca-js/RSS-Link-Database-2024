They are not getting enough attention. So our goal is to tell you about them. Our focus is on tech-of-technology that shapes the future. We believe, that the tech-of-tech is the best lens to focus on the future. What do you get in this newsletter? Two features and two interviews a month. Delivered weekly. That\u2019s it.
