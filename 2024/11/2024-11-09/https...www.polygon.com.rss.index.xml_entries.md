<p class="has-text-align-none">Halloween may be over, but the hunt for great thrillers is always on. Netflix has quite a few excellent options this month, including an original movie from the end of October and a surprising movie you might not know about.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Every month, we handpick a few of the best thrillers on Netflix that fit the current season. Sometimes they pair well with an upcoming release. Other titles might be new additions to the platform.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This month we’ve got a Netflix new arrival, a horrifying dystopian movie from just a few years ago, and a very underappreciated gem that deserves a whole lot more attention. </p>
