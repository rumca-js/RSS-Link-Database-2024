I really want a book where Santa is real but isnt a kids book. I don&#39;t mind some spice in it but last year I read &quot;a Court of Sugar and Spice&quot; a nutcracker retelling and that was just porn with very little plot and has scarred me for life. Sadly I fear I&#39;m going to have to write the book I want to read. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ImportantAd6125\"> /u/ImportantAd6125 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1gn24y6/in_need_of_a_adult_christmas_fantasy_book/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1gn24y6/in_need_of_a_adult_christmas_fantasy_book/\">[comments]</a></span>", "id": 1482498, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1gn24y6/in_need_of_a_adult_christmas_fantasy_book", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 532, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "In need of a adult Christmas fantasy book", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-11-09T04:26:33+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I haven\u2019t read a complete book in quite a while,(Years maybe) and I\u2019d really like to find something interesting to read.
