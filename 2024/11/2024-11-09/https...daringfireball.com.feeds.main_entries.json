But here\u2019s the thing I want to emphasize right up front: my mom\u2019s death was OK. It really was. She was 78, which isn\u2019t that old, but her health had not been great. She was hospitalized for several days in May, just a month prior, after she had collapsed at home, too weak to stand, and for days it wasn\u2019t clear what was wrong. Then some more test results came back and we had the answer. She had ovarian cancer, bad. It had already metastasized. The prognosis was grim: months to live, at best. And those months, toward the end, would inexorably grow ever more painful and profoundly sad.</p>\n\n<p>Her mental acuity had begun to slip in recent years, too. Not a lot, but if you knew her you\u2019d notice. But she faced this prognosis with remarkable dignity, courage, and clarity. She knew the score.
