<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey guys! Does anyone here have a link to a stream that shows SNY (Sportsnet New York)? More specifically, I’m looking for ways to watch UConn Women’s Basketball as the vast majority of their games are carried by this network. I’ve been scouring the web on different piracy services and SNY seems to be too niche to be carried for them. Would anyone here have luck finding a stream for this channel?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/KingKrafted"> /u/KingKrafted </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1gnmy6d/any_stream_for_sny_sportsnet_new_york/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1gnmy6d/any_stream_for_sny_sportsnet_new_york/">[comments]</a></span>

Well once it finished verifying the first file (which is usually named fg-01.bin), for some reason the program that verifies the files before install suddenly crashes not even after finishing to verify the second .bin file (fg-02.bin).</p> <p>Is there a way I can fix this?

I&#39;ve been watching from pirate streaming websites like Soap2Day and Flixtor when it was still around, but lately I&#39;ve been noticing lots of the servers failing to stream the show for me. With that, I started getting concerned about the show becoming lost media since it&#39;s not very well known, and Hulu might just as well drop it. I wanted to torrent it and save it on my external hard drive full of shows and movies I like hat I fear might become lost media, but none of the torrents I&#39;ve found have seeders.
