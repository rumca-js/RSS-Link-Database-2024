The oceans play a pivotal role in drawing down atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO₂) and have so far acted as a brake on the full impact of climate change. Current estimates of the CO₂ from the atmosphere that disappears in the ocean, commonly referred to as the ocean CO₂ sink, suggests that around 25% of all human CO₂ emissions have been taken up by the oceans.

Scientists believe individuals of the most recently discovered hominin group (the Denisovans) that interbred with modern day humans passed on some of their genes via multiple, distinct interbreeding events that helped shape early human history.

This week, researchers hypothesized that human culture is distinguished from cultures of other species like whales by unique open-endedness—the ability to communicate and understand an infinite number of possibilities. An ancient unicellular organism provided evidence that embryonic development evolved before actual animals. And researchers reported that the Earth experienced a massive, rapid melting period following the last ice age. Additionally, we reported on the sociological implications of blowing deadlines, a method to calculate the mass and spin of a black hole, and the evolution of species coloration.

Standing at a woodland entrance to the world's longest cave system in Kentucky, a park ranger warns those about to enter of an extremely deadly fungus—not for humans, but for the bat populations it has devastated across North America.
