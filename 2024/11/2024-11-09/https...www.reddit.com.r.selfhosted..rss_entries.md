<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Howdy...I&#39;ve been slowly expanding my self-hosting and would like to add retro gaming to my set-up to primarily serve through browsers and mobile devices. I&#39;ve never been into the emulation hobby up to this point...but my research has brought me to RomM, which I plan to set up soon. My question, however, revolves around retro PC gaming (90s-2000s). Does RomM support this capability in any way? It appears to be geared primarily towards retro console gaming. Is there anything out there that would serve emulated retro-pc games to browsers and/or mobile devices? Or is that just not a thing?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/PM-Ur-DadJokes"> /u/PM-Ur-DadJokes </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1gnmj0e/retro_pc_gaming_on_browsermobile/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1gnmj0e/retro_pc_gaming_on_browsermobile/"

The only detail I noticed is that right before this issue started, I experienced an internet outage and had to restart my router. However, my IP is still the same, and as I mentioned, external access is working perfectly. I tried creating a new NPM instance just to add a container, and the same problem occurred...

It is an old workstation to be used for Jellyfin/plex/arrs on Docker on Ubunutu.

## cockpit virtual machines - can't figure out permissions for non /var storage of images, qcow etc

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Is there a good tutorial (that is fairly recent) for using cockpit (or perhaps without cockpit) on ubuntu server with libvirt/kvm to setup vms where they AREN&#39;T stored on the main boot drive of the host? Google Fu has revealed a few tutes but I&#39;ve seen what appear to be conflicting approaches to how to get permissions to work while also using security best practices. (IE, don&#39;t just use 777 on the images directory) </p> <p>I&#39;m mounting an ext4 drive to /mnt and adding that as a storage pool. This setup is basically just to test. I&#39;ve been hoping to switch this drive to ZFS for my actual setup so that might get even weirder?? </p> <p>So far I&#39;ve tried editing the qemu.conf file so that user=myuser and group=libvirt-qemu and setting the permissions for the storage pool to the same. I still get a permissions error for the storage location when trying to install alma linux. Any suggestions?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted

Iâ€™d love to know the best way to get started with this and what kind of setup would be good for a beginner. I donâ€™t have much experience with self-hosted storage, so any advice or recommendations on hardware, software, or even just things to consider would be super helpful!</p> <p>Some questions I have:</p> <p>What hardware should I look into as a beginner?</p> <p>Are there particular brands or setups youâ€™d recommend for reliable, personal cloud storage?</p> <p>How do I ensure data security and redundancy?</p> <p>Is there a big learning curve, or is it manageable with some patience?</p> <p>Thanks in advance for any guidance you can share!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Repulsive_Judge_3360"> /u/Repulsive_Judge_3360 </a> <br/> <span><a hr

And a few minecraft server both modded and vanilla [runs on a pc I built out of old part 16gb ram i5 6th gen desktop cpu]. Where I live electricity is very expensive and the price is rising fast. I have been looking for something to help me self host all of these things. I was thinking of getting a mini pc as I thiught that the current gen igpus combined with 64gb+ ram would help me run big LLM, and the rest would run on the cpu thus generating text wouldnt impact performance of my other services. I also thought of a used mac mini with an M2 chip but I have no clue how well it would work. Can you install linux on it? and i
