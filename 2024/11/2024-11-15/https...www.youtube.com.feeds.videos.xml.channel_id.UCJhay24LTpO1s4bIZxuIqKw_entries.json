The speaker recounts the chilling reality of growing up during the Cold War, where the threat of nuclear annihilation was a daily concern. Highlighting the immense destructive capability of these submarines, which can carry multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicles (MIRVs), the talk emphasizes the importance of remembering the existence and potential consequences of such weapons. Despite their impressive engineering, Herb Sutter advocates for the continued wisdom to avoid their use, reflecting on the balance between technological advancement and the need for global peace.\n\nSponsored By think-cell\n---\n\nThe ACCU Conference is the annual con", "id": 1521078, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPs4JGPkqEs", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 421, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCJhay24LTpO1s4bIZxuIqKw", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/dPs4JGPkqEs/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Lightning Talk: What\u2019s the World\u2019s Deadliest Military Vehicle? - Herb Sutter - ACCU 2024", "vote": 0}]
