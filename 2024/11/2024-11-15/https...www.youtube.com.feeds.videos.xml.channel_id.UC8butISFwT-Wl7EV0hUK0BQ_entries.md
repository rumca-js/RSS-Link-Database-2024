On this week's episode of the podcast, freeCodeCamp founder Quincy Larson interviews Tim Ruscica, the software engineer and prolific programming teacher behind the @TechWithTim  YouTube channel. He's also developed courses on freeCodeCamp's YouTube channel.

We talk about:
- How Tim managed to get a $70k salary by hacking his way into a Microsoft internship when he was just 19
- How he learned computer architecture as a kid by playing Minecraft
- Lessons he learned from a failed tech startup
- Why he recommends Python as a first programming language. "It's the least overwhelming thing to get your hands dirty."

Can you guess what song I'm playing in the intro?
