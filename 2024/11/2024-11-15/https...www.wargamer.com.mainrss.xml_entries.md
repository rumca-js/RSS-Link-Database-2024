								<p>If you ask a friend what their favorite board game is and they respond with ‘Monopoly’ the thing to do is <em>not </em>force them to join you for a lengthy game of Root or Twilight Imperium. It’s also not to embark on a five minute rant about the many drawbacks of that property-trading exercise in misery, as hard to resist as that might be. What you <em>should</em> do with a friend so tragically unaware of the joys of modern board gaming, is sit them down for a quick game of <strong>Ticket to Ride</strong>.</p>

								<p>When you think of <strong>Warhammer 40k</strong>, “bath-time” probably isn’t at the forefront of your mind. But at least two Space Marine chapters, the Iron Snakes of Ithaka and the Blood Angels, approach bath time with the same intensity that they approach all-out galactic war. Here’s what’s going on...</p>

								<p>7 Wonders Duel, one of the most popular two-player <b>board games</b>, has been adapted into a new Tolkien-themed tabletop title. It’s clear that plenty of DNA has been passed down, but The Lord of the Rings: Duel for Middle-earth <i>does</i> attempt to add its own spin to the original’s tried-and-tested rules. Unfortunately, even the smallest game mechanic can change the course of the future – and these new features both help and hinder the overall experience.</p>
