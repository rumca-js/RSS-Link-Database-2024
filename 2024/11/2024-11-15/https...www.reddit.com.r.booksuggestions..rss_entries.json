Now, I&#39;ve never really been a book person before but I recently started with a couple books and have been having a lot of fun! I read Six of Crows and Crooked Kingdom (Leigh Bardugo) and absolutely loved the world building and the depth of each character, the plot is interesting and every twist blows my mind, plus the little romantic subplots were the cherry on top. Unfortunately, I just finished reading Powerless (Lauren Roberts) and really disliked it. It felt very cringey and unoriginal. Of course this is just my opinion, I felt simply disappointed and underwhelmed with this book, especially after reading such a good duology. So, could someone recommend me a book similar to SoC please?

So awhile back, maybe a year at this point? I saw a book recommendation on my reels. I lost it but it&#39;s been on my mind heavily lately so i&#39;ll try to describe what i remember. I think it was a female author &amp; the paperback cover was of a beach and i distinctively remember a white seashell on the side of the cover. The girl recommending said it had to do with being independent or alone, as a girl in particular who struggled with being single and lonely. Im definitely not doing this book justice but this is all i can remember.

Are there any books or series that would be similar but for a slightly older audience? She loves the school aspect and some of the crazy things that happen (and I think she likes having one central first-person narrator). She\u2019s read some of the Harry Potter books but isn\u2019t into the magic/fantasy and prefers more real world scenarios.
