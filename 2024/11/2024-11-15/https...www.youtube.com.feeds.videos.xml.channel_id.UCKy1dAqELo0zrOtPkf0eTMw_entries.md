In today's Daily Fix:
Embracer, the mega conglomerate that owns the Tolkien license and publishes a slew of games from Factorio to Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed, has provided a financial update on their recent games. And it's not good. The Epic Mickey remake sales were "slower than expected." Return to Moria, a Lord of the Rings survival crafting game, did well on PC, and was released on PS5 this year to decent sales, but it wasn't enough to stop the company from selling off Borderlands dev Gearbox Software, or Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2 dev Saber Interactive. In other news, Infinity Nikki, an open-world dress up game, has a release date of December 5th. The game comes from former Zelda director Kentaro Tominaga. And speaking of release dates, Atomfall, the "British Fallout," will hit PlayStation and Xbox consoles and PC on March 27, 2025. It's also a day one game for Game Pass.
