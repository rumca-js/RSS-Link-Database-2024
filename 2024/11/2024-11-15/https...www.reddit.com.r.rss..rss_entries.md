<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m trying my hand at creating a google reader api-compatible feed reader both as a learning opprotunity and to implement the features I&#39;ve been missing in other readers. However, I&#39;m stuck on how to implement the 24 character user IDs that the google reader api expects. It looks like google had their own way of generating them, but I&#39;m just wondering how implement userid creation in a way client applications will understand.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/roboticfoxdeer"> /u/roboticfoxdeer </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1grpny4/generate_userid_for_google_readercompatible/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1grpny4/generate_userid_for_google_readercompatible/">[comments]</a></span>
