<p>Long before Taco Tuesday became part of the pop-culture vernacular, Tuesdays were synonymous with security — and for anyone in the tech world, they still are.  Patch Tuesday, as you most likely know, refers to the day each month when Microsoft releases security updates and patches for its software products — everything from Windows to Office to SQL Server, developer tools to browsers.</p>



<p>The practice, which happens on the second Tuesday of the month, was initiated to streamline the patch distribution process and make it easier for users and IT system administrators to manage updates.  Like tacos, Patch Tuesday is here to stay.</p>

<p>The EU, which is now developing guidelines for how the region’s new AI law must be complied with, has started collecting opinions in two areas <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eusurvey/runner/Prohibitions-and-Definition-Survey-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via an online survey</a>.</p>



<p>The first area involves how the law should define AI systems (compared to traditional software). Here, the EU wants to hear from people in the AI ​​industry, companies, academics and civil society. The second area concerns when the use of AI should be prohibited. The EU wants detailed feedback on each prohibited use and is particularly interested in practical examples.</p>

<p>The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is reportedly preparing to investigate Microsoft for potentially anti-competitive practices in its cloud computing division. This inquiry centers on whether Microsoft is abusing its market dominance by deploying restrictive licensing terms to dissuade customers from switching from its Azure platform to competitors, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/62f361eb-ce52-47c1-9857-878cfe298d54">the Financial Times reported.</a></p>

<p>If you’re still trying to remember all of your passwords and then type ’em into sites by hand, let me tell you: You’re doing it wrong.</p>



<p>With all the credentials we have to keep track of these days, there’s just no way the human brain can handle the task of storing the specifics — at least, not if you’re using complex, unique passwords that aren’t repeated (or <em>almost</em> repeated, even) from one site to the next. That’s where a password manager comes into play: It securely stores all your sign-in info for you and then fills it in as needed.</p>



<p>While there’s a case to be made for leaning on a dedicated app for that purpose (for reasons we’ll discuss further in a moment), Goog

<p>One out of every five PCs shipped in the third quarter of 2024, a total of 13.3 million units, was a PC with a neural processing unit (NPU) fine-tuned for generative AI (genAI) development, according to data published Wednesday by analyst firm Canalys.</p>



<p>It is anticipating a rapid rise in shipments of these AI-capable PCs, surging to 60% of units shipped by 2027, with a strong focus on the commercial sector.</p>



<p>Such machines typically house dedicated chipsets, including AMD’s XDNA, Apple’s Neural Engine, Intel’s AI Boost, and Qualcomm’s Hexagon, <a href="https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/ai-pc-market-q3-2024">Canalys said in a statement</a>.</p>
