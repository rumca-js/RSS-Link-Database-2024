## Is there a better way to handle multiple DRF generic views for a single endpoint with different methods?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m trying to build by user endpoint out with 3 methods, GET to get info about the current user, POST to create a new user, and DELETE to delete a user. I have a generic view for each of those methods, but right now i have to use a really sketchy way of combining them all into one url with different methods. Here is my views code:</p> <pre><code> class UserView(APIView): def delete(self, request, *args, **kwargs): # DRF views expect a normal django request object, and when they get one, they automatically upgrade it to a DRF request # So when this view gets a Django request, it upgrades it to a DRF request, so when I pass it down to another DRF view # It breaks because that one is also expecting a normal Django request. Adding ._request gets around this by getting the # original Django request object out of the DRF one. return DeleteUserView.as_view()(request._request, *args, **kwargs) def post(self, request, *args, **kwargs): return RegisterUser

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>It always seemed like a bad idea to have end users and staff users use the same user system. Seems like even their DB tables should be isolated from each other. The dango User system is pretty good for staff so is there a good approach for extending that for end users that would also define a strong separation?</p> <p>For example, devs and content staff should be able to use the admin without any way of screwing up end user data. Migrations for Admin/staff models should have zero impact on end user models. </p> <p>Perhaps I&#39;m being too fussy about it but it just seems like end user systems and admin/staff users systems should be as disconnected as possible. </p> <p>Is there a common practice for this? </p> <p>Thank you! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Hans__Blix"> /u/Hans__Blix </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/1gs8ah4/user_schemes_adminstaff_and_end_users_us

This reduces the overhead of accessing your database, leading to improved performance.</p> <p>You can turn it on like this:</p> <pre><code>DATABASES = { &quot;default&quot;: { &quot;ENGINE&quot;: &quot;django.db.backends.postgresql&quot;, # ... &quot;OPTIONS&quot;: { &quot;pool&quot;: True, }, }, } </code></pre> <p>If you want fine-grained control over your connection pools, you can also explicitly configure them by passing in a dictionary of settings:</p> <pre><code>DATABASES = { &quot;default&quot;: { &quot;ENGINE&quot;: &quot;django.db.backends.postgresql&quot;, # ... &quot;OPTIONS&quot;: { &quot;pool&quot;: { &quot;min_size&quot;: 2, &quot;max_size&quot;: 4, &quot;timeout&quot;: 10, } }, }, } </code></pre> <p>This little detail makes it easier to optimize your
