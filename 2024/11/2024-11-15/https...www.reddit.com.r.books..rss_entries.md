<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Im nearly done with the book “I want to believe” by A. M. Gittlitz and I want to say I enjoyed it significantly more than expected. It’s about the history of a Latin American communist figure named Posad who in modern times has very much become a meme. At first I purchased it for the meme thinking it would be a funny book but the in depth analysis of this guy and the things he’s done was shocking. I have another book on Cuban history that correlates to a lot of the sorties told in “I want to believe”. All in all an unexpectedly great historical book. And of course it goes over the memes lol </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Cozy_Citrus"> /u/Cozy_Citrus </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gs7lqn/i_want_to_believe/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gs7lqn/i_want_to_believe/">[comments]</a></span>

While I definitely appreciated it for the masterpiece that it is, I did find myself confused at times about certain things.</p> <p>One big question I have is: how did the Master know so much detail about Pontius Pilate, the death of Jesus, Levi, Judas, etc.? It sounds like Woland/Satan was there to witness all of the actual events, so did he somehow transfer this detailed knowledge to the Master?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/hipp0s"> /u/hipp0s </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1grzgyn/question_about_the_master_and_margarita/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1grzgyn/question_about_the_master_and_margarita/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Appreciation post to the prose of Jeffrey Eugenides. This book was tragic, beautiful, depressing and left me with a deep empathy for these characters. The boys who loved them, the parents who were left behind, and the Lisbon girls who lived and died only together. I had seen the movie, first when I was younger and again a few years back. My experience differed both times- when I was young I had no relation to these emotional women, yet. When I was older I understood this film of heartbreak and tragedy. Now I have just finished the book and am truly touched by this gaze into a family down the street whom no one understands and left to mystery. </p> <p>Please comment if you want to talk about this book. I would love to hear what you have to say. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/joeyfashoey"> /u/joeyfashoey </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1grmcyg/the_virgin_suicides
