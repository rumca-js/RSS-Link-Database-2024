<p>Teams meet in Paris on Saturday having delivered brutality and artistry in some of the sport’s greatest games</p><p>It is France-New Zealand time again. These words should conjure a frisson in any rugby connoisseur – and, by and large, they do. There are other more intense rivalries – the All Blacks against South Africa or Australia, for example, or England against, well, anyone – but for the promise of all that is holy in union, the brutality and the artistry, nothing quite stirs the imagination like Saturday night’s encounter in Paris.</p><p>All the more so given it is a quarter of a century since the greatest France-New Zealand episode of them all – some say the greatest match, full stop. On Halloween 1999, a suitably portentous date, these two met at Twickenham in the semi-final of the Rugby World Cup. What unfolded, it hardly requires a student of the game to recall, was the sort of nightmare only the French seem capable of inflicting on the All Blacks, who saw their 24-10 le

He has achieved this status without steady acting gigs; interviews, documentaries and cameos have been more than enough.

Plenty of fans might well tune in to something called Martin Scorsese Presents: The Saints just to hear the famed film-maker and Catholic monologue for 30 or 40 minutes about any subjects that happen to interest him. Instead, he’s uncharacteristically reserved, if still energetic for a busy octogenarian.</p><p>The project is an odd one, even by Scorsese’s prolific standards: An eight-part series on saints for Fox Nation, a streaming service affiliated with the

There she staged fairytale reimaginings of everything from Puss&nbsp;in Boots to Mother Goose; in 2019,&nbsp;she retold Dick&nbsp;Whittington as a&nbsp;young Jamaican who boarded the Empire Windrush in&nbsp;search of his fortune in London.</p><p>This year, McKenna turns her attentio

Though despite a hard-hitting interim report and a gamechanging (for public awareness) ITV drama, most post office operators are still waiting for their compensation. The campaigner Alan Bates recently wrote to Keir Starmer to ask what was going on. Twice. His first letter went unanswered. Despite £1.8bn having been for compensation in the budget, progress has been glacially slow. One of the last people to give evidence this week was the Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, who as business secretary from early 2023 to July this year had overall responsibility for the postal service. Most witnesses to the inquiry have begun by saying how sorry they are for the scandal, even if they have later been at pains to point out it was nothing to do with them. There was <a href=

 The <em>Opuntia zebrina f. reticulata</em> is an unusual cactus due to its distinctive crisscross markings on the pads, which give it a unique, snakeskin-like appearance.

<p>The Scottish film-maker on bringing humour to his look at male emotional repression, being compared to Louis Theroux, and his problems with reality TV</p><p>Silence is golden – at least where men are concerned. The “strong, silent type” endures as an aspirational archetype, whether you are a man yourself, or simply someone who interacts with them. In popular fiction, the Jack Reacher action novels have sold about&nbsp;100m copies. The big man’s catchphrase is, tellingly, not a phrase at all, rather, it’s an anti-phrase: “Reacher said nothing.” In film, one of&nbsp;the ultimate images of machismo is&nbsp;Arnold Schwarzenegger in The Terminator: leather jacket, motorcycle and, famously, only 17 lines of dialogue in the whole of the first film.&nbsp;And at the frillier end of cultural representations of men, the likes of Heathcliff in Emily Brontë’s Wuthering Heights depend more on their ability to smoulder a lady to a crisp with a glance than on their emotional articulacy.</p><p>It

<p>On the 20th anniversary of the seminal game, we look back at the extraordinary moment where sci-fi dystopia turned into tense and terrifying body horror</p><p>At the start of Valve’s Half-Life 2, the seminal first-person shooter game that turns 20 this month, taciturn scientist Gordon Freeman is trapped within a dystopian cityscape. Armed soldiers patrol the streets, and innocent citizens wander around in a daze, bereft of purpose and future. Dr Wallace Breen, Freeman’s former boss at the scientific “research centre” Black Mesa, looks down from giant video screens, espousing the virtues of humankind’s benefactors, an alien race known as The Combine.</p><p>As Freeman stumbles through these first few levels of Half-Life 2, the player acclimatises to the horrible future laid out before them. It’s hardly the most cheerful setting, but there are some friendly faces (security guard Barney, Alyx and Eli Vance) and even moments of humour, as Dr Isaac Kleiner’s pet, a debeaked face-eating

Jacob Elordi has become Emerald Fennell’s go-to muse, appearing in both Saltburn and her upcoming Wuthering Heights adaptation. Maude Apatow has gone away and directed her first movie.

Great. Do you, by any chance, have a tendency to martyrdom? I only ask because, as Christmas season looms on the horizon, the female impulse to sacrifice our own pleasure or free time in the cause of doing things for others gets particularly intense. Writing cards to people you haven’t spoken to all year. Making sloe gin to give as gifts. Buying stocking presents for the dog.

<p>Dessert-trolley gourmands have dominated perfumery for years, but there are signature scents to be found for those lacking a sweet tooth</p><p>Fragrances are traditionally separated into families – floral, woody, opulent and so on&nbsp;– according to their predominant notes, characteristics and identifying structure. You could argue that this way of classifying scents is outmoded and limiting, if it weren’t for the outright commercial dominance of those from the gourmand family (sweet, edible-smelling notes such as honey, caramel and candy floss) in modern perfumery. Millennials and gen Z love them, making the creation of dessert-trolley scents a licence to print money for a good five years now. Which makes my admiration all the greater for Hermès and their decision to defy the market and make their first major fragrance in several years a&nbsp;chypre called Barenia.</p><p>Fragrances from the chypre (pronounced SHEEP-ruh) family are characterised by a mossy, drier, often warm feel

<p>A wonderful but thoroughly conventional celebration of the science of evolution</p><p>All things must pass, but some leave legacies. That is the story of life on Earth. Fossilised remains of organisms represent just one of the various treasure troves of information about how life used to be, one set of clues to why it is the way it is today. In the early 20th century, genes entered the storehouse of evidence for&nbsp;evolution, first as theoretical particles, later as the unit of selection, and today with molecular precision. Some 165 years after Darwin’s Origin of Species, evolution by natural selection is incontrovertible, the proof&nbsp;of it irrefutable and bounteous.</p><p>Richard Dawkins has done the lord’s work in sharing this radical idea for more than a third of that time, partly through research, but with wider impact in his general writing. This book, one of nearly a dozen he has written about evolution, looks set to be&nbsp;his last (he has called a tour to&nbsp;suppor
