Currently, using Plex and lidarr which is hooked up to my media indexes. But I still find myself having to manually add/download the majority of my music. Is there some better indexes people are using for music. Or something that also helps streamline the automation, like overseerr but for music?</p> <p>Much appreciated </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/M05final\"> /u/M05final </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1gs3wcv/how_are_you_automating_your_music/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1gs3wcv/how_are_you_automating_your_music/\">[comments]</a></span>", "id": 1523447, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1gs3wcv/how_are_you_automating_your_music", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 450, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "How are you automating your music?", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-11-15T18:22:43+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Im switching from Google Workspace to self hosted.</p> <p>So far I have found: - Nextcloud for Google Drive - Mailcow for Google Mail - Immich for Google Photos - Vaultwarden for Google Vault</p> <p>Still searching for the following: - Google Meet alternative - Google Forms - Google Chat - Google Calendar - Google Contacts - Google Docs Signatures</p> <p>What are my options?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/hackermarks\"> /u/hackermarks </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1gs2yzg/switching_from_google_workspace/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1gs2yzg/switching_from_google_workspace/\">[comments]</a></span>", "id": 1523065, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1gs2yzg/switching_from_google_workspace", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 450, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Switching from Google Workspace", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-11-15T18:09:23+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;ve played around with enabling https in Tailscale, and tried to set up Traefik for it.

I\u2019m setting up an OPNsense firewall and ran into an issue with accessing the web interface when connected over a managed switch. I&#39;ve added my current VLAN setup in the pic below (in case it helps). </p> <p>Current situation:</p> <ul> <li>When I connect my laptop <strong>directly</strong> to the LAN port of the OPNsense machine, I can access the web interface just fine.</li> <li>When I connect the LAN port of the OPNsense machine to port 1 and my laptop to port 2, the laptop does not appear to receive an IP by the DHCP server and I&#39;m unable to access the web-interface.</li> </ul> <p>I suspect it might be a VLAN misconfiguration, but I&#39;m not entirely sure how to proceed. Any advice on troubleshooting steps to make this work?</p> <p>Thanks in advance for any help!</p> <p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/1ny5vtlp231e1.png?width=773&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c89a61b4cfc6b216b61589ce9cd265c8df36d52d\">My Current VLAN conf", "id": 1522334, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1grz20q/opnsense_web_interface_accessible_but_not_through", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 450, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "OPNsense Web Interface Accessible, But Not Through a Switch \u2013 VLAN Issue?", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-11-15T15:06:09+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I have a news blog that sees about 50-100k sessions a month.

However, I want to do some operations first (encrypt locally) before it&#39;s transferred to AWS. I did not find a specification for hooks or plugins which would&#39;ve been nice to have.</p> <p>It does have <a href=\"https://min.io/docs/minio/linux/administration/monitoring/bucket-notifications.html\">Bucket Notification</a> which can fire events at the Bucket or Object level and I could trigger a webhook, and I guess it is probably gonna need queues to be able to handle multiple files coming in at the same time, so I&#39;m wondering how some of you implement encrypt-and-push pipelines like this, and whether something like this already exists before I reinvent the wheel.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/floofcode\"> /u/floofcode </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/", "id": 1519332, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1grmbgn/minio_hosters_who_push_backup_files_offsite_how", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 450, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "MinIO hosters who push backup files offsite, how did you implement this?", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-11-15T02:24:00+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;m looking for a self hosted photo library with folder structure like browser option in it&#39;s web app, user definable folder permissions, and the ability to access the folders via SMB without causing an issue.</p> <p>Synology photos shared space almost get&#39;s there, it has has the folder structure style, and I can do whatever I want via SMB without causing an issue.
