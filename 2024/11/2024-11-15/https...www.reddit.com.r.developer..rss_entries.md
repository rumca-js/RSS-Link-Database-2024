<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Looking for some insight here and Iâ€™ll get straight to the point. I have a price matrix set up which gives the approximate time for a job to be completed along with the rate for said job. The goal would be to efficiently dispatch a said number of jobs in a 10 hour time frame and reach or surpass a day rate of $1280 for x amount of drivers. </p> <p>What is the difficulty level here? What other information would be needed to create/ run a macro (in excel for example) to do so? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/mdewechter"> /u/mdewechter </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1grnn61/transportation_dispatching/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1grnn61/transportation_dispatching/">[comments]</a></span>
