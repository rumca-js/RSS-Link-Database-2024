Lightning Talk: What’s the World’s Deadliest Military Vehicle? - Herb Sutter - ACCU 2024
---

Herb Sutter explores the evolution of deadly war machinery from ancient times to the modern era, focusing on the Ohio-class ballistic missile submarine, a symbol of Cold War-era doomsday weaponry. The speaker recounts the chilling reality of growing up during the Cold War, where the threat of nuclear annihilation was a daily concern. Highlighting the immense destructive capability of these submarines, which can carry multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicles (MIRVs), the talk emphasizes the importance of remembering the existence and potential consequences of such weapons. Despite their impressive engineering, Herb Sutter advocates for the continued wisdom to avoid their use, reflecting on the balance between technological advancement and the need for global peace.
