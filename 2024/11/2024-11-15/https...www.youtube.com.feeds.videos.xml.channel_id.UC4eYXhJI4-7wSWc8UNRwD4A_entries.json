Throughout his entire, window-rattling performance, Durand Jones sang fervently of hope, finding joy in sorrow and perseverance through struggle and doubt, with one of the most memorable voices we\u2019ve had at the Desk.\n\nBacked by a small but equally impressive group of gospel singers, including three members of The Harlem Gospel Travelers, Jones shimmied, glided and belted his way through four tracks from his debut solo release, Wait Til I Get Over.
