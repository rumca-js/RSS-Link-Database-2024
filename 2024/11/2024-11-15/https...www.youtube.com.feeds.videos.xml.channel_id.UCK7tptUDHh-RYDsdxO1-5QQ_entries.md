The next test flight for SpaceX’s massive Starship rocket is scheduled for Nov. 18. CEO Elon Musk wants Starship to revolutionize spaceflight and on Oct. 13, SpaceX made history in aerospace engineering when Starship’s booster was caught by two mechanical arms as it descended to the launch pad.

From China and Russia, to NASA and Boeing, none of SpaceX’s competitors have been able to reuse rockets like SpaceX does. So what are SpaceX’s goals on its next test flight?

WSJ explains the significance of Starships development and previews what to expect in its next mission.
