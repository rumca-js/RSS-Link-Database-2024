<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello everybody,</p> <p>The last couple of months i tried to pickup reading again and i managed to read a couple of books. - Ready player one This i really enjoyed due toe pop culture / gaming references and the way of writing - Lord of the rings I’m a huge fan of the series but reading them took me a huge deal of discipline due to somewhat difficult writing style for me (not a native speaker) - Jurassic Park Very much a exciting story and I enjoyed the writing style - Borehole Cool story I enjoyed the science part of it.</p> <p>Now im looking for something new to read. I do like adventure, history and gaming related subjects.</p> <p>One of the books im thinking of is The Journey to the West by Wu Cheng’en</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Lapito3000"> /u/Lapito3000 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1gs982w/adventure_books/">[link]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I love sci Fi, fantasty, romantasy even the spicy stuff. My problem is that I am so annoyed when I am reading it listening to several anxiety ridden pages of idiotic thoughts (maybe slightly reasonable thoughts) when the character just needs to clarify something. Like a couple of words or a sentence to to clarify the misunderstanding or accusation or call for help. For the first time in my life there are book series that I do not finish because I can&#39;t stand the hyper anxious reading style of the narrator or, or there is page after page of character misunderstanding or spinning out with WHAT IFs when they&#39;re literally in the middle of a conversation with someone. It drives me crazy, I want them to get to the point and be logical. ( Crazy, right?) For instance, Spark of the Everflame came highly recommended by some people that I share book interests with as well as social media readers. I had really high hopes for this series.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi, sorry little disclaimer english isn&#39;t my native language! Now, I&#39;ve never really been a book person before but I recently started with a couple books and have been having a lot of fun! I read Six of Crows and Crooked Kingdom (Leigh Bardugo) and absolutely loved the world building and the depth of each character, the plot is interesting and every twist blows my mind, plus the little romantic subplots were the cherry on top. Unfortunately, I just finished reading Powerless (Lauren Roberts) and really disliked it. It felt very cringey and unoriginal. Of course this is just my opinion, I felt simply disappointed and underwhelmed with this book, especially after reading such a good duology. So, could someone recommend me a book similar to SoC please? (It doesn&#39;t need to be heist related hehe) I really want to bounce back from my latest read, Thank you!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/s

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi, I am looking for suggestions for books that are reminiscent of Whams “Last Christmas” song/music video. More specifically the aesthetic of the video or the subject matter of the song, doesn’t necessarily have to be both in one book. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated, thanks! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Psychological_Ad512"> /u/Psychological_Ad512 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1grltol/books_that_are_similar_to_whams_last_christmas/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1grltol/books_that_are_similar_to_whams_last_christmas/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>What’s your favorite book series? I spent this past year discovering how much I actually love to read, despite my whole life thinking I hate it 😬 so with that being said, I’ve never read a book series before! Give me your best suggestions- I’m open to anything. However I do prefer little to no “spice.” thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/nahnahjohn"> /u/nahnahjohn </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1grl904/give_me_a_series_suggestion/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1grl904/give_me_a_series_suggestion/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Okay this is gonna be a weird and vague post, but hopefully someone knows what im talking about! So awhile back, maybe a year at this point? I saw a book recommendation on my reels. I lost it but it&#39;s been on my mind heavily lately so i&#39;ll try to describe what i remember. I think it was a female author &amp; the paperback cover was of a beach and i distinctively remember a white seashell on the side of the cover. The girl recommending said it had to do with being independent or alone, as a girl in particular who struggled with being single and lonely. Im definitely not doing this book justice but this is all i can remember. Thank you!!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/conversehighh"> /u/conversehighh </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1grktra/cant_find_the_book_title_of_a_book_i_saw_as_a/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.co

## Weird School or Junie B Jones-like books for older kids?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>My daughter loved the Weird School and Junie B Jones books when she was younger, but now that’s she’s older (10) she’s having trouble finding series that are similar but more young adult-ish. Are there any books or series that would be similar but for a slightly older audience? She loves the school aspect and some of the crazy things that happen (and I think she likes having one central first-person narrator). She’s read some of the Harry Potter books but isn’t into the magic/fantasy and prefers more real world scenarios.
