<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m new to 3d printing just as a casual hobby and it saddens me how much plastic is being wasted on filament poop by my Bambu Lab P1S AMS every time it swaps to a different color. I just printed something with 3 colors and it pooped like 450 times for a simple print. This makes absolutely no sense to me. Hasn&#39;t anyone thought of a better solution to this yet? For example, someone must have thought of a solution like dual extruders, 2 filament tubes coming out from the AMS, and then a servo swapping the extruder when flipping to a new color? The AMS could swap 2 filaments per extruder, instead of 4 to 1? Just seems like a complete waste and I don&#39;t get why there aren&#39;t better solutions or alternatives out there yet for multi-color printing. I&#39;ve heard of patents blocking advancements in 3d printing technology that would make more sense, and that&#39;s just insane to me...</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="h
