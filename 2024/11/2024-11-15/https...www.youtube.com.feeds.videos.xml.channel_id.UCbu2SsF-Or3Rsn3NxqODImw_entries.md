GUNDAM: REQUIEM FOR VENGEANCE RED VS BLUE brings players the ultimate Gundam power fantasy in Fortnite, with access to a massive arsenal of popular weapons in each faction’s armory to maximize combat and robot takedowns while minimizing searching, looting, and traversing.

The game is designed to deliver tense combat and thrills across the battlefield, culminating in an immersive, first- person cockpit view as if they were a real Gundam pilot. Players who take the most vengeance on their
enemies will climb the global leaderboards and be entered to win Vbucks and Gunpla model kits from Gundam: Requiem for Vengeance, with leaderboards resetting each week.
