With good advice coming in from books, conference talks, and blog posts beyond count, it's a daunting topic even for experienced developers.  Can we make the subject more approachable?\n\nYes we can.  If we look a little deeper, there are some fundamental principles behind the advice. Further, these principles seem to belong to a small number of \"domains\", each addressing a very different aspect of unit testing and software development.\n\nFor example, \"Test error conditions separately\", \"Tests should be easy to read\", and \"Write the unit tests first\" are all great advice, but each is aiming for a very different goal.\n\nIn this talk, we'll survey these domains of unit testing practice, identify some of the basic practices involved in each, and put the larger discussion of unit testing into a more useful context.
