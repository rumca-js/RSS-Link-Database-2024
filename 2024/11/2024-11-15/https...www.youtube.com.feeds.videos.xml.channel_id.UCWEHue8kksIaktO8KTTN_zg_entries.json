You'll learn how to extract stock market data via two API services, analyze that data, and get buy/sell/hold recommendations through logic or an AI system. Using TimescaleDB (enhanced PostgreSQL), we supercharge Django's capabilities to handle larges amounts of data that changes rapidly over time -- like the stock market. This new found ability for Django to handle time series data unlocks a whole suite of potential from sensors to analytics to level up any app you need to build.\n\nWe'll start by creating our own custom API clients to extract data from stock market API providers Polygon.io and Alpha Vantage. Building a custom API client in Python helps us master each API service our application relies on while transforming the data into a format we need. \n\nAfter we build the API client, we integrate ", "id": 1523277, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3O1z5hTdUM", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 74, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCWEHue8kksIaktO8KTTN_zg", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/O3O1z5hTdUM/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Python Tutorial: Stock Trading Bot", "vote": 0}]
