In this video, I put major gaming companies to the test by buying their official refurbished consoles. I picked up a PS5, Xbox Series X, and Nintendo Switch directly from Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo to see if they're actually worth your money.

Plus, I crack them all open to show you exactly what's inside these "certified refurbished" machines.
