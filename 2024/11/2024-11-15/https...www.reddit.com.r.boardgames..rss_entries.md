<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Recently got 7 people in my office to play diplomacy. We&#39;re having a great time, but it looks like the game will finish up here in the next couple weeks. I&#39;ve been moderating and running the office map, and people have already started asking me what we&#39;re going to do next. What are your favorite games that can be played asynchronously with a group (preferably 8 +/- 2) like Diplomacy can? The most loved features of the game are the politicking and simultaneous turns, so bonus points if you can suggest something with either or both of those features. I should note we are in an office setting and can print off anything and put it up on the walls, as well as potentially have an area to lay a permanent board. We do not have access to mobile devices in the office so any app-enhanced board games are out of the question.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/lilBlue717"> /u/lilBlue717 </a> <br/> <s

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Alr so today at school me and my friends played this game and none of us know what the game is called.</p> <p>So we all get cards and whoever had the most cards goes first. The person starts off with a randomized card since you cannot look at your cards at all—and the person with all of the cards wins.</p> <p>And like if theres a double card you have to hit the table/the deck for you to claim it and if theres someone out since they don’t have any cards left, they can also hit it to claim the cards and get back in. And for example if you put down an Ace next person has to put down 4 and if they put down another card letter (like Joker which you have to put down 1, Queen you have to put down 2, and King that you have to put down 4) then the other person puts it down and if they do w/o any letter cards then the person that put down the letter card gets all of the cards from the deck. And this might be an additional rule but if you run out of cards while

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Playing board games with my kids (ages 4-8) has been a real eye-opener. One thing that keeps standing out is how much better they are at pattern-matching mechanics. Games like &quot;Spot It!&quot;—where you have to quickly identify connections or matches—are where they absolutely crush me.</p> <p>It’s not even close sometimes; they spot things instantly while I’m still processing. It makes me wonder if their brains are just wired for this kind of thing at this age, or if it’s something about how they approach games differently from adults.</p> <p>Have you noticed kids excelling at certain mechanics like this? Are there other types of games where they seem to have a natural edge?

A shot give you 3 mana</p> <p>I was guessing that maybe dices at your turn was the best option : 1 not enough do nothing, 2 or 3 2 mana, 4 and 5 3 mana, 6 too powerful you lose 2 mana</p> <p>What do you think ?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/MrDouggy"> /u/MrDouggy </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1grj83h/playing_not_enough_mana_without_alcohol/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1grj83h/playing_not_enough_mana_without_alcohol/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Information on our individual play styles:</p> <p>Player A is extremely smart and can very quickly and easily discern optimal strategies in every game. This is the player to beat essentially.</p> <p>Player B is also very smart and can strategize. However, not nearly easily and quickly as Player A. As a result, they take long turns, and frequently, especially towards endgame, will take their turn ‘multiple times.’ Meaning, they will take their turn, then if there is any other possible action they could have done instead, they will undo and then redo their turn to determine if they can accumulate more points. Player B has openly admitted that they do this to have a chance of winning against Player A.</p> <p>Me - I just want to play the game. I am nowhere near Player A’s level, and I have accepted that (mostly). Trying to compete will result in me mimicking Player B, which I refuse to do. It makes the entire experience not fun for me.
