I have a APK that takes Photo from Camera and sending it to server. I need to make this Request on PHp. we figured out how the Requests are made. They Encode the Image to Base64. But my own Pictures that I Send are declined after 5 Minutes from Service Provider. That means they put something in the JPEGs. So I ended up on opening the File in Text Editor and saw that there is a JSON and some Cryptographic thing at the end. I have to build the same Signature !? On my Pictures and sending it to them If someone is willing to help I am Paying 500\u20ac for this work. I will send u the APK ( The Library is obfuscated) &quot;CameraInfo_availableRecordingResolutions&quot;: &quot;unknown&quot;, &quot;CameraInfo_availableResolutions&quot;: &quot;[4096x3072, 4096x2304, 4096x1856, 4000x3000, 3840x2160, 3264x2448, 3072x3072, 2592x1944, 2560x1440, 2400x1080, 1920x1440, 1920x1088, 1920x1080, 1600x720, 1560x720, 1520x720, 1440x1088", "id": 1524453, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ReverseEngineering/comments/1gs8qxv/apk_reverse_eng_library_puts_some_data_to_jpeg", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 476, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ReverseEngineering/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "APK Reverse Eng.
