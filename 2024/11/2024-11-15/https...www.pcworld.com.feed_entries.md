<p>When you’ve got a kitchen table and a bunch of spare shipping boxes, a standing desk and comfortable office chair can feel like excessive splurges. But investing in good ergonomic equipment doesn’t have to be expensive—not during Black Friday, at least.</p>



<p>In the lead-up to Thanksgiving weekend, deals in this category tend to be a little sleepier. (That’s especially so because I’m picky about what I recommend—I take user reviews, technical specs, price trends over the past year, and the feedback from PCWorld staff into account.) But a couple are already worth looking at if you want an early start on your holiday shopping.</p>



<p>And if these don’t suit you? Keep checking back. Things tend to heat up the closer we get to the big date, which this year is November 29.</p>

<p>SSDs have cost more throughout 2024, but Black Friday is coming to offer some relief. How do we know? Prices are already dropping as part of early Black Friday deals, as stores once again begin their sales ahead of the big day.</p>



<p>But not every discount is a good discount, even with the overall price hikes since last year. To save the most cash, it pays to know how and where to shop—so to help, we’ve made a list of the best deals, as well as tips for shopping. You’ll find both below.</p>

<p>VPNs aren’t just useful for keeping your online activities safe and private, they’re also a great way to bypass restrictions on streaming content in other countries. The top VPN providers continue to stay one step ahead of streaming services in a never-ending cat-and-mouse game, ensuring that you always have access to your favorite content no matter where you are. I’ve thoroughly tested the top VPNs on the market to see how they fare at unblocking the top streaming sites and curated the best in the list below.</p>



<p><strong>Why you should trust me:</strong> Here at PCWorld we’ve been testing computer hardware, software, and services since the 1980s. For my part, I’m continually testing all of the major VPNs on the market and many lesser-known services in order to curate a list of the very best VPNs across a variety of categories.

<p>Black Friday once was a single, frantic day of shopping. Back then, you’d wake up at the crack of dawn the day after Thanksgiving, drive to a mall, and fight over CDs, televisions, and computers. People with sharp eyes and quick reflexes would snag incredible deep discounts amid piles of questionable “bargains.” </p>



<p>Later on, online retailers launched Cyber Monday as a digital version of the free-for-all, with an eventual melding of Black Friday and Cyber Monday to first take over the whole Thanksgiving weekend, then eventually the entire month of November. Recently, deals sometimes even started in October.</p>



<p>This year’s a bit more quiet, though—which puts even more emphasis on knowing the best time to buy. Jump too soon, and you’ll pay more than you need. Hold out too long, and you might miss the top sale items. Not to worry, though. If yo

<p>Game preservation, or lack thereof, is a hot topic among gamers and developers at the moment. So it’s good to hear that the owners of an important bit of gaming history are both <em>aware</em> that their games are being shared online for free and explicitly <em>endorsing</em> it.</p>



<p>I’m talking about the classic PC shooter <em>Unreal</em> and its multiplayer sequel <em>Unreal Tournament</em>, which can both be downloaded from the Internet Archive <a href="https://archive.org/details/gt-unreal-1998">here</a> and <a href="https://archive.org/details/ut-goty">here</a>, respectively.</p>



<p>If you’re not old enough to remember the Clinton administration, you might only know “Unreal” as the engine that powers tons of popular 3D games today. It’s named after one of Epic’s oldest games from 1998, a <em>Quake</em>-style early 3D shooter, and the game en

<p>Covertly intercepting video signals is a very old-fashioned way to go about electronic spying, but a new method discovered by researchers puts a frightening spin on it.</p>



<p>A research team out of Uruguay has found that it’s possible to intercept the wireless electromagnetic radiation coming from an HDMI cable and interpret the video by processing it with AI. Three scientists from the University of the Republic in Montevideo <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09717">published their findings on Cornell’s ArXiv service</a> earlier this year, as spotted by <a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/104015-ai-can-see-what-screen-reading-hdmi-electromagnetic.html">Techspot</a>.</p>



<p>It’s possible to train an AI model to interpret the tiny fluctuations in electromagnetic energy from the wired HDMI signal, the paper says. Even though it’s a wired standard

(I eventually got the shoes, thanks for coming with me on this journey.) It looks like those fake stores are ramping up, as thousands of malicious online storefronts have been identified as part of a new scam ring to steal payment info.

For just $500, you can snag this powerful gaming handheld that lets you play all your favorite PC games portably.</p>



<p>The powerful ROG Ally runs on an AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor along with 16GB of RAM. Plus, it comes with AMD RDNA3 graphics to ensure you get great visuals, especially when you run demanding titles.</p>

<p>ChatGPT and other similar AI chatbots are becoming a bigger part of everyday life for many people. Though a Windows app for ChatGPT has been available for some time, it’s only been for those who have ponied up for a premium plan — until now.</p>

Users who have installed the update, however, are reporting a strange message that’s showing up ever since.</p>

<p>A high DPI, or dots per inch, resolution of the sensor occupies pride of place in most players’ minds as the most important feature to look out for for better performance in gaming mice. But the truth is, having a mucho high DPI – one in the region of 20,000 to 30,000 – is more of a novelty than anything else.</p>



<p>To be sure, serious gamers rarely use anything above 1,600 DPI and certainly never more than 3,200 DPI. That’s not something I’ve just read about – I, too, have tried out different DPI stages and find that performance tanks when DPI is cranked even a measly point past 3,200.</p>
