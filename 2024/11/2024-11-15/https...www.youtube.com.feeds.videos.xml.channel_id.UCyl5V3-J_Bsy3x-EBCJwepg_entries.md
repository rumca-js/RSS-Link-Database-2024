The Babylon Bee reacts to some of Trump’s early picks for cabinet positions in his administration like Pete Hegseth, Kristi Noem, and Mike Huckabee. Democrats took issue that they are not all qualified experts like their uncontroversial Democrat cabinet picks. Also, former Trump attorney Michael Cohen got gloriously trolled on a livestream. The Bee also talks to Lathan Watts from Alliance Defending Freedom about The Babylon Bee’s ongoing lawsuit against the state of California.
