<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone, I&#39;m developing a website with a friend of mine with a search bar in the centre, the site is called <a href="http://Sesiavalley.com">Sesiavalley.com</a> and takes its name from the valley where we were born.</p> <p>I&#39;m not very convinced by the design of the writing... unfortunately I have to leave it green and that&#39;s the only limit since in Italy they call it the green valley.</p> <p>The design of the name doesn&#39;t really convince me though...</p> <p>As you can see we are beginners but we are putting a lot of effort into it and I am also finishing the last buttons, do you like the buttons?</p> <p>Do you have any advice to give us?</p> <p>We would be very happy.</p> <p>Best regards</p> <p>Sesia Team (x2)...
