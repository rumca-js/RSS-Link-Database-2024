A new route to materials with complex disordered magnetic properties at the quantum level has been produced by scientists for the first time. The material, based on a framework of ruthenium, fulfills the requirements of the Kitaev quantum spin liquid state—an elusive phenomenon that scientists have been trying to understand for decades.
