<p>Reform may well be Labour’s new main opponent, and the next battleground may not be where anyone expected</p><p>Two key rules of politics are to always look ahead, and to understand your opponent. And so it is that just months after crushing the Conservatives in a general election, many Labour MPs are bracing for fresh challenges and a new foe – Reform UK.</p><p>Nigel Farage’s party is in parliamentary terms a minnow, its five MPs giving it little more than 1% of the Commons strength enjoyed by Keir Starmer. But many within Labour believe that by the time of the next election, things could be very different.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/nov/15/with-tories-beaten-labour-next-threat-reform-wales">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Stars of tomorrow, including under-21 debutant Jobe Bellingham, swap shirts and stories in goalless friendly</p><p>Dean Huijsen revived an old tradition here. When was the last time you saw a footballer not just swap shirts with his opponent but immediately put it on too? As the final whistle went, the Bournemouth defender who was born in Amsterdam but represents Spain where he was raised, made straight for Samuel Iling-Junior who, like him, had played at Juventus. He moved like a young man on a mission, which it turned out he was. They embraced and when Huijsen finally walked off he was wearing white, a No 14 on the back.</p><p>It had been that kind of night, a familiarity and a sort of mutual admiration about the place, something of themselves seen in each other. Something shared, and not just, as it turned out, the scoreline. At the end, ball boys holding camera phones had run on seeking out Jobe Bellingham, who had played over an hour on his U21 debut, while players from each

<ul><li>Ireland 22-19 Argentina</li><li>Three first-half tries enough for Andy Farrell’s side</li></ul><p>Jeopardy is a word with plenty of currency in rugby these days. Mostly it’s used in reference to how competitions are structured, but also in describing individual matches. This one had plenty. Not always evident, especially in the first half when Ireland looked a good deal better than against the All Blacks. But the race down the home straight, with Argentina a man down, had heaps of it. When at last the pressure was relieved for the home team pretty much all of them called the knock on.&nbsp;</p><p>By way of compensation after last week the light rain made its way elsewhere well before kick off, so we had a game with fewer stoppages and, mercifully, fewer scrums: just one in the opening quarter. And plenty of quick, watchable rugby.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/nov/15/ireland-argentina-autumn-nations-series-match-report-rugby-union">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Old-school charm faces off against big-money leagues, as short-form tournaments threaten to sideline the  old order</p><p>Two cricketing worlds collide next week. Australia and India meet on Friday in Perth in the opening Test of what promises to be an epic <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/articles/c0k8z8llxyjo">encounter</a> –&nbsp;the first five-match series between the two great rivals since 1991-92. Five-match Test series used to be the norm. However, with the exception of England&nbsp;v&nbsp;Australia, they have become rare. One‑day cricket, and&nbsp;especially&nbsp;Twenty20, has eroded the time&nbsp;available&nbsp;for the longest form of the game, forcing&nbsp;series to be shortened to three or even two matches. What used to be a novel lasting all summer has become a novella, over in a trice. But in this Australian summer, something like tradition again rules. Five Tests spread over a month and a half, with the Christmas and new year Tests in Melbourne and Sydney

<p><strong>Saatchi Gallery, London</strong><br>The Wedge Collection, one of the world’s most prominent private assemblages of Black portrait photography – or indeed of any photography – lands in London</p><p>How did a Canadian dentist become one of the most important collectors of photography in North America? The story begins with one picture. Specifically, a James Van Der Zee picture of a young couple dressed in raccoon fur coats and posing with their Cadillac V-16 Roadster in Harlem. Everything is gleaming. It’s the ultimate aspirational image.</p><p>But this picture was taken 1932, the era of racial segregation in America. Slavery had been abolished 67 years previously but anti-black racism, including lynching, was rife, and rural southerners flocked to northern cities to escape it.

<p>The Oscar-winning actor, writer, director, musician and star of Bad Santa, Armageddon and The Man Who Wasn’t There is ready to answer your questions</p><p>What is Billy Bob Thornton’s most iconic role? Some may say the taciturn barber in the Coen brothers’ The Man Who Wasn’t There, others might contend it’s the learning disabled killer in his early film Sling Blade. But we all know the truth: it’s the sex-addicted alcoholic Father Christmas in Bad Santa who is obsessed with the “three Bs” (look it up, this is a family publication).</p><p>Be that as it may, Thornton has had a stellar Hollywood career since emerging in the mid-90s. Sling Blade, the independent 1996 film he wrote, directed and starred, won him a best adapted screenplay Oscar – though his directing career went into hibernation after a difficult time adapting Cormac McCarthy’s All the Pretty Horses a few years later. However, he became a stalwart of mainstream and independent acting in that period, with roles in Armage

Karen loves dancing so much she is, literally, carried away by her shoes. This version by Nancy Harris promises to bring the story into the 21st century. Is it enough to do that by putting characters into modern dress?</p><p>Marc Teitler’s music is lovely and Colin Richmond’s set and costumes are exquisite. But beneath the attractively modernised surface, the story upholds the old morality, undermining it only in the last lines of the play, and not in a way that resolves its core sadism toward a girl who dares to look in the mirror and have “notions about herself”. There is no attempt to bridge the gulf between

<p>The novelist on Virginia Woolf’s luminous prose, obsessively rereading James Baldwin and why Saint Augustine is his favourite writer</p><p><strong>My earliest reading&nbsp;memory</strong><br>
 The earliest book I remember reading and loving was Crockett Johnson’s <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/harold-and-the-purple-crayon-9780007464371?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article">Harold and the Purple&nbsp;Crayon</a>. A boy imagines himself into an&nbsp;adventure, gets into&nbsp;trouble, imagines a&nbsp;way&nbsp;home. It bears rereading still: it’s the very best parable of the creative life I know.</p><p><strong>My favourite book growing up</strong><br>
 I read voraciously and indiscriminately as a kid, so much so that I’m not sure I really had favourites. I loved the Judy Blume books I stole from my&nbsp;older siblings’ bookshelves and the darker novels of Cynthia&nbsp;Voigt. Two series by the fantasy writer Mercedes Lackey left a mark: M

<p>Unlike tribute acts or bands still going with no original members, the likes of Held By Trees and House of All are leveraging time spent in their former groups to make music that looks forward as well as back</p><p>Charlie Hollis – the son of the late Mark Hollis, the enigmatic creative force behind Talk Talk – is proceeding cautiously. “It’s so easy to be misconstrued,” says Hollis, who looks and sounds very much like his father, who died in 2019. “Lineage, DNA, influences, they’re all massively important for anyone making music. But I’d be very careful about using words like ‘tribute’, because it completely gives the wrong impression.”</p><p>Hollis is discussing his involvement in the group Held By Trees, described on their Bandcamp page as “an instrumental post-rock collaboration heavily inspired by Talk Talk/Mark Hollis, and working with musicians that played for them”. The band is a passion project of multi-instrumentalist/producer David Joseph, a 40-year-old Church of Englan

<p>An excellent Billy Bob Thornton heads up a starry, bloody tale of Texan oil magnates v drug cartels. Plus: Barack Obama’s startling underwater odyssey – and the return of a stone-cold 90s classic</p><p>Tommy Norris (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/billy-bob-thornton">Billy Bob Thornton</a>) is a crisis executive for an oil giant colonising Texas and it’s a stressful job – especially when he is tied, hooded and bloodied while trying to negotiate a multibillion-dollar land lease with a drug cartel. This drama is loosely adapted from the Boomtown podcast, which explored the race to exploit the state’s Permian Basin oil fields. It’s a rough-handed, picaresque affair – there are huge sums of money at stake and everyone from the farmers occupying the land to the working stiffs seeking their fortunes fancy a piece of it. Thornton is excellent as the man trying to conduct the chaos, with Jon Hamm and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/sep/14/we-can-be-violent-to-ours

Increasingly scarce water supplies are among the risks for future wars – a finding that may be of particular concern to host country Azerbaijan, which depends on upstream sources outside of its borders for most of its water.
