In a letter spotted by <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/15/24297364/steam-extremist-content-moderation-us-senator-warner-letter"><em><ins>The Verge</ins></em></a>, Senator Mark Warner (D-VA) asked Valve CEO Gabe Newell how he and his company are addressing the issue.</p>
<p>“My concern is elevated by the fact that Steam is the largest single online gaming digital distribution and social networking platform in the world with over 100 million unique user accounts and a user base similar in scale to that of the ‘traditional social media and social network platforms,’” Warner wrote.</p>

The organization said legal means are its “last resort” in its fight against the bogus stories, designed to foster pro-Russia and anti-Ukraine sentiment, that festered on the platform. “X’s refusal to remove content that it knows is false and deceitful — as it was duly informed by RSF — makes it complicit in the spread of the disinformation circulating on its platform,” RSF director of advocacy Antoine Bernard said in a statement.</p>

Why did it take until the tail-end of 2024 to institute a seemingly simple tool that has been available for rival platforms for years? Who knows, but it’s here now.</p>
<p>The appropriately-named Message Drafts offers “a new and easy way to find your unfinished messages on WhatsApp.” Just look for the “Draft” indicator at the beginning of a message. The platform says that these unfinished messages will move to the top of the chats list so “people can quickly locate them.”</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It’s a drafts feature, so there really isn’t anything else to say. The tool’s available now across the globe via the app. Finally, we will have no pressure to actually finish messages. We can tinker with them occasionally until the heat death of

The Meta-owned service is starting <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.threads.net/@zuck/post/DCZXY14P2Yy" data-original-link="https://www.threads.net/@zuck/post/DCZXY14P2Yy">to test</a> a feature that allows users to pin topic-based feeds to the home screen of the app.</p>
<p>The change will give people additional feeds beyond the algorithmic “for you,” which will remain the default view, and their “following feed.” Users can add custom feeds by searching a keyword like “skincare” and then tapping the “...” menu and selecting “create new feed.” These feeds can be further customized by adding specific profiles of people whose posts you want to see in that feed. Users are able to add up to 128 custom feeds in the app, a Meta spokesperson said, though it

The display is brighter this time around, peaking at 1,000 nits for SDR (standard dynamic range) content and 1,600 nits for HDR material. However, there&#39;s another aspect of the screen about which Apple has strangely been keeping mum.</p>

<p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TMSC) is the first CHIPS Act awardee to get part of the money that the government has promised. The Biden administration has finalized its grants for TSMC, which expects to receive $6.6 billion in grants as part of their agreement to grow semiconductor production in the US. TSMC will also loan another $5 billion from the government to fund the expansion of its planned $65 billion three-factory complex in Arizona.

<p>For obvious reasons, Twitter users are leaving en masse and heading to Bluesky, its most prominent decentralized competitor. In this episode, we discuss why Bluesky now feels like the best of early Twitter, filled with vibrant conversations and people discovering a new social network filled with useful features (like serious blocking and content filtering). And of course, the lack of an algorithmic feed surely helps. Also, we chat with Justin Hendrix from Tech Policy Press about how Elon Musk has become a crucial ally to the upcoming Trump administration.</p>

## The Morning After: Our verdict on Apple’s M4 iMac

<p>One quiet update that transforms the lineup, beyond the powerful M4 chip, is the boost in base memory, finally giving the entry-level models 16GB instead of the miserly 8GB they used to get. With an unchanged design, there might seem to be no justification to buy or upgrade to the iMac M4. However, that extra memory allows you to do more than ever on an entry-level iMac, including 4K video editing and AAA gaming — to a degree. Having said that, upgrades remain expensive beyond the base loadout, which is already $1,299.</p>

<p>Imagine never having to fumble with a charging cable again. That's the magic of a wireless charger. Not only does going wireless clear up your space and make charging as simple as setting your phone down, but it’s also surprisingly versatile. Whether you’re looking for a sleek charging pad for your nightstand, a stand that keeps your phone propped up on your desk or even a foldable charger for convenient travel, there's a wireless charger designed to fit your lifestyle. Some even double as a car charger, keeping your phone powered up on the go without the hassle of cables to plug in. With so many convenient options, it's easy to see why more people are ditching their wired chargers and embracing the effortlessness of wireless.</p>

<p><em>The Rogue Prince of Persia</em>, a modern reboot of the classic platformer published by Broderbund in 1989, is still in early access mode but it’s getting a bunch of new, cool-sounding stuff next week. Developer Evil Empire posted a blog on <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2717880/view/4508758658863071521"><ins>the game’s Steam page</ins></a> that includes information about the new update and premieres a new teaser trailer with some gameplay footage.</p>
<p>The Steam page says the update “effectively doubled the game’s content from launch.” “The Second Act” will include a second act and “tons of narrative polish for Act 1” and more biomes, bosses and enemies. The update will also add more “Quality of Life” features like multiple save slots and localization for German, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Russian and Spanish players. The game’s protagonist will also look pretty different — RIP Prince of Purple.</p>
