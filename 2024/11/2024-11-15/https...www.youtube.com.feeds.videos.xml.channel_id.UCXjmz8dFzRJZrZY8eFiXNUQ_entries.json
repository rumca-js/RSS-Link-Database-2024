Though there are moments throughout the Lord of the Rings that many fans see as more comedic or rediculous in the grand scheme of the story.  But even in these light hearted moments, Peter Jacksons vision across the entire trilogy is magical.  Everything lands with audiences because of his specific ideals surrounding The Lord of the Rings.  We don't get moments like the Battle of Helms Deep without a little shield surfing on the side.    Only Peter Jackson could have pulled this off with The Lord of the Rings.\n\n#lordoftherings #peterjackson #ringsofpower #twotowers #legolas \n\nSOURCES\nhttps://www.inverse.com/entertainment/helms-deep-oral-history-lord-of-the-rings-two-towers\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JTuCgg3kg8\nhttps://youtu.be/6Koa50421Pg?si=P2dlTm-DbozdwaSr&t=1328\nhttps://youtu.b", "id": 1523298, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nXWZyxeouA", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 236, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXjmz8dFzRJZrZY8eFiXNUQ", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/8nXWZyxeouA/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Why The Lord Of The Rings NEEDED This Ridiculous Moment", "vote": 0}]
