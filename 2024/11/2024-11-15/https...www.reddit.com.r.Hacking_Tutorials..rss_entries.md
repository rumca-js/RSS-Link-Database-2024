<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I purchased a course in biochemistry but sadly I came late and the course and its contents are about to be deleted, I tried to record using regular recording screen apps but I couldn&#39;t, so I used mirroring to my laptop with Scrcpy, but the app knew that I am in developers mode, But I kept searching and found a way to get around this issue, But when Scrcpy mirrors the android the video is in pitch black. Do you guys know what I could do to bypass this black screen to record the video ?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Anxious-Panda6857"> /u/Anxious-Panda6857 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking_Tutorials/comments/1gryzrs/i_want_to_screen_record_a_video_on_my_android_for/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking_Tutorials/comments/1gryzrs/i_want_to_screen_record_a_video_on_my_android_for/">[comments]</a></span>
