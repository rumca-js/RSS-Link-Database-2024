Facts are important, but facts don&#8217;t create learning. Stories do. A story fits into (and changes) our understanding of the world. Good teachers are storytellers, and storytellers are teachers. Notes, then, aren&#8217;t recitations of facts. They&#8217;re story prompts. A good note reminds you of a story that you already understand.
