<p>In the wake of <a href="file:///www.infoworld.com/article/2336682/jdk-23-the-new-features-in-java-23.html/%22">Java Development Kit (JDK) 23</a>, which arrived September 17, work now focuses on the planned successor release, <a href="file:///openjdk.org/projects/jdk/24/%22">JDK 24</a>, which has ballooned to 21 proposed features. The two most recent additions proposals would improve Java’s resistance to quantum computing attacks, by providing Java implementations of a quantum-resistant module-latticed-based digital signature algorithm and a quantum-resistant module-latticed-based key encapsulation mechanism.</p>

<p>Public cloud providers are eager to oppose this line of questioning. They point to the shared responsibility model. If cloud customers spend too much money, it’s usually because they created cost-ineffective deployments. It’s common knowledge that many enterprises “lifted and shifted” their way to the clouds with little thought about how inefficient those systems
