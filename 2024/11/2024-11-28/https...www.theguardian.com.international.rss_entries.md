<p>This series about a tight-knit queer community joyfully celebrates British camp culture – from deadpan humour to loving Lorraine Kelly. What a shame it’s not more funny</p><p>Dickie is a drag queen – but not a very good one. For a start, he finds it impossible to get his eyebrows right: they’re usually scrawled haphazardly across the upper reaches of his forehead. And while his every utterance comes suffused with bitchy energy, he flounders during any actual war-of-wits. What Dickie does have, however, is a ridiculously inflated sense of self-worth: in the grand tradition of sitcom monsters, his three defining personality traits are vanity, delusion and a spectacular dearth of talent. When his boyfriend decides he’s had enough of this “selfish, egotistical prick”, Dickie’s impulse is to soften his heart with a repulsively flat rendition of Make You Feel My Love, which is cut short when he is hit by a car. Needless to say, he doesn’t get his man back.</p><p>Dickie would probably li

<p>Tottenham could have no complaints about dropping more points in the Europa League. An entertaining contest tilted this way and that, neither side seeming to know how to defend, and Roma earned a deserved draw when Mats Hummels made it 2-2 in stoppage time.</p><p>For <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/14/claudio-ranieri-roma-head-coach-aged-73-out-retirement">Claudio Ranieri, back in London and out of retirement</a>, it was a joyous moment. He had spent the night bouncing around his technical area, his struggling team’s shoddy finishing driving him to distraction. Roma, whose hopes of reaching the Europa League knockouts remain in doubt, had trailed to a Son Heung-Min penalty and Brennan Johnson’s strike. But Spurs could not control the game and Ange Postecoglou’s side still have work to do.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/28/tottenham-roma-europa-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

They are yet to score many, either, notching just seven goals in their five games. The latest victims of Simone Inzaghi’s smooth, efficient machine were RB Leipzig, whose own disastrous pointless campaign continued with a 1-0 defeat. An own goal from Castello Lukeba decided it after a wicked free-kick from Federico Dimarco, the wing-back playing an unfamiliar midfield role but was just as dangerous. As Leipzig desperately chased something from the match to rescue their campaign, it fell to the Inter defence to show off their usual control, the experience of Benjamin Pavard, Stefan de Vrij and Alessandro Bastoni as the defensive trio seeing out the job in some comfort.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/28/champions-league-review-pain-for-psg-b

As an Olympic gold medal-winning cyclist accustomed to pushing himself at the gym and on his bike, twinges weren’t unusual. But, as the pain became constant, his physiotherapist referred him for a scan where a tumour was detected. Further scans and a second consultation revealed prostate cancer that had spread to his pelvis, hip, ribs and spine. Then came the final blow: it&nbsp;was incurable. The prognosis was between two and four years.</p><p>In a state of shock, Hoy – who is now 48 – went home with his wife, Sarra, to digest their new reality. The couple have two young children so, until they knew the treatment plan, they decided to keep the news to themselves aside from close friends and family.
