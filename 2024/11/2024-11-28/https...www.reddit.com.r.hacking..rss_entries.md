<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am looking for a wordlist generator that also mixes words, so for example if two of the input words are &#39;Keyboard&#39; and &#39;Demon&#39; the wordlist should generate passwords that include &#39;Keymon&#39;, &#39;Deboard&#39;, &#39;Dekey&#39; and so on. Extra points if the tool can also leet only some characters: &#39;Kem0n&#39;.</p> <p>Does a tool like this exist or do I need to make one myself?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Rikai_"> /u/Rikai_ </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1h25wrn/alternatives_to_cupp_that_splits_and_mixes_words/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1h25wrn/alternatives_to_cupp_that_splits_and_mixes_words/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>My target is to make sure pdf runs on a single system and for that i need to collect basic sysinfo. How can that be done? </p> <p>Minimum: create a uuid or hash based on sysinfo and push to server so if pdf is opened on another pc, i will know. Best case: also include process running. I do not need anything related to user </p> <p>I don&#39;t know how to do that as Javascript can be disabled in pdfs. And if i hide a binary in it, it could trigger antivirus or need admin privileges</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/hafi51"> /u/hafi51 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1h1uvw0/geetung_basic_system_info_with_pdfs/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1h1uvw0/geetung_basic_system_info_with_pdfs/">[comments]</a></span>
