<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I read about a solo artist who, in the studio, would purposefully stop his band before they&#39;d rehearsed his songs to the point they were overly polished, preferring the energy of early takes where the musicians were still discovering the songs and perhaps more engaged with the music.</p> <p>It may have been Bowie in the 70s or Dylan around Blonde on Blonde, and maybe only for an album or a few songs. I just can&#39;t find where I read it. And yeah, it&#39;s possible many artists have done this.</p> <p>Just thought it was an interesting creative choice.
