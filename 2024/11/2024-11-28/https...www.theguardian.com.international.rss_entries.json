And while his every utterance comes suffused with bitchy energy, he flounders during any actual war-of-wits.

When his boyfriend decides he\u2019s had enough of this \u201cselfish, egotistical prick\u201d, Dickie\u2019s impulse is to soften his heart with a repulsively flat rendition of Make You Feel My Love, which is cut short when he is hit by a car.

We hand out honours and dishonours from the latest round of action</p><p><strong>Inter: </strong>The 2023 finalists are second in the table and yet to concede a goal. They are yet to score many, either, notching just seven goals in their five games. The latest victims of Simone Inzaghi\u2019s smooth, efficient machine were RB Leipzig, whose own disastrous pointless campaign continued with a 1-0 defeat. An own goal from Castello Lukeba decided it after a wicked free-kick from Federico Dimarco, the wing-back playing an unfamiliar midfield role but was just as dangerous. As Leipzig desperately chased something from the match to rescue their campaign, it fell to the Inter defence to show off their usual control, the experience of Benjamin Pavard, Stefan de Vrij and Alessandro Bastoni as the defensive trio seeing out the job in some comfort.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/28/champions-league-review-pain-for-psg-b",

To see what could be coming, look to Bulgaria</p><p>Abandonment, when it came, crept in from the outskirts. Homes at the edge of town were first to go, then the peripheral grocery stores. It moved inward, slow but inexorable. The petrol station closed, and creeper vines climbed the pumps, amassing on the roof until it buckled under the strain. It swallowed the outer bus shelters, the pharmacies, the cinema, the cafe. The school shut down.</p><p>Today, one of the last institutions sustaining human occupation in Tyurkmen, a village in central Bulgaria, is the post office. Dimitrinka Dimcheva, a 56-year-old post officer, still keeps it open two days a week, bringing in packages of goods that local shops no longer exist to sell. Once a thriving town of more than 1,200, Tyurkmen is now home to fewer than 200 people.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2024/nov/28/great-abandonment-what-happens-na",
