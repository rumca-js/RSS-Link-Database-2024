I have heard plenty of good reviews about Arkham Horror 3E, with many stating that it is their preferred game over EH, so I am thinking of purchasing it. As luck would have it, it is currently on sale because of Black Friday. I am thinking of getting it, but I wanted to get the community&#39;s opinion beforehand.</p> <p>If I get it, I would like to purchase it with all the expansions already since it&#39;s pretty difficult to purchase board games where I live since the game is already out of print, and resellers often sell older games for nearly 2x the original price.</p> <p>How similar is the game to Eldritch Horror? Is it the same to assume that since I enjoyed EH, I would enjoy AH3E? How would you all rate the expansions? Which ones would you say are &quot;must haves,&quot; and which ones can be skipped or added very little?</p> <p>PS. Sorry, I know this q",

I can think of three.</p> <ol> <li><p>When Agricola came out, it came with a huge pile of cubes and cardboard punch outs. People who got a special promo copy got meeples shaped like animals and vegetables. FOMO ran wild and everybody wanted meeples that were actually shaped like something instead of just cubes. There was a huge secondary market for bootleg meeples. Before that, cubes were the norm and after that people were not satisfied with cubes anymore.</p></li> <li><p>Pandemic made co-op games huge. Before that, they were rare. It also introduced me and a lot of other people to solo gaming. I remember sitting at the table, looking at it after everyone else got up to go do something and realizing that I could just play it again by myself.</p></li> <li><p>Dominion launched a lot of deck builders. For me, that\u2019s when card-based games really broke through in the boardgaming community.</p></li> ",
