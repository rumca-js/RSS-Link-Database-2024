Craig Finn is fascinated by the creative process, including the experiences, stories and memories that inform songwriting. Finn has certainly written many songs — he’s released nine studio albums with his band the Hold Steady as well as another five solo releases — and now he’s branched out into the podcast world where he can talk to other creative people about their memories and stories and what inspires them. And if that’s not enough, Finn has been busy taking the show on the road with his “This Is What It Looks Like: Solo Songs and Stories" tour, which stops at the Fitzgerald Theater in St. Paul on Saturday, Nov. 16. 

Despite his busy schedule, Finn visited The Current studio to play this three-song solo acoustic set
