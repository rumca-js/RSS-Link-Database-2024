## Brighter Shores feels an awful lot like RuneScape, but its promising start is still missing some key ingredients

Even discounting all the hours spent training Pok&eacute;mon, it's still going to be an uncomfortably large number thanks to my 18-year investment in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/runescape">RuneScape</a>. Technically, I could find out at least how much time, down to the minute, I've spent in Gielinor by talking to an NPC called Hans. I don't talk to Hans. I've long accepted that RuneScape is more of a life choice rather than a video game. </p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/brighter-shores-feels-an-awful-lot-like-runescape-but-its-promising-start-is-still-missing-some-key-ingredients">Read more</a></p>

I didn't want to play Forspoken at all, but I had &pound;5. Forspoken on PS5 has sat on my desk (complete with character cards) sealed since November 17, 2023. Yes, this was a waste of &pound;5. I'm an idiot who does stuff like this (<em>glances over at a shelf full of Mega Drive games I can't play as I don't own a Mega Drive)</em>, but in recent days this pristine copy of a middling PS5 exclusive from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> has started to haunt me. I no longer have a PS5 with a disc drive, so of course I want to play Forspoken more than I've wanted to play any other game in my life.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-ps5-pros-major-missing-feature-and-a-5-cop
