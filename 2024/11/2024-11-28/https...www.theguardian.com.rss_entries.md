Great intro.</p><p>Hello, fellow night owls (in the UK), and welcome to our coverage of the second day’s play at the Hagley Oval. Christchurch looked a picture yesterday, and the game was pretty decent, too. New Zealand were 199 for three on a pitch that was green but hardly treacherous before England snapped back, Shoaib Bashir sneaking in an opening day four-for and Brydon Carse looking more and more like a very serious Test bowler. It ended 319 for eight, the visitors probably a touch happier.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2024/nov/28/new-zealand-v-england-first-mens-cricket-test-day-two-live">Continue reading...</a>

<p>What lies beneath this ice giant’s surface might be the potential for life – but not as we know it</p><p>For nearly 40 years, Uranus and its five largest moons have been <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cgk1333k0ypo">dismissed</a> as frozen and lifeless. This view was formed by humanity’s only close encounter with the Uranian system at the edge of our cosmic neighbourhood. Data sent back by Voyager 2 in 1986 indicated that the distant ice giant was sterile and inactive. But that probe had the misfortune of flying past Uranus just when a powerful solar storm hit, creating a distorted impression of its true nature. Far from the barren worlds previously assumed, a new analysis suggests that the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/11/science/uranus-voyager-2-flyby.html">celestial bodies</a> could hold hidden oceans, and perhaps even the conditions necessary to support life.</p><p>This news should put rocket boosters on the <a href="https://www.space.com/nasa-uranus-or

Hasse travelled widely, and in the 1730s he divided his time between Germany and Italy, where he was regularly commissioned by the opera houses in Naples and Venice. But he produced liturgical music too, and he was appointed <em>maestro di cappella</em> (chorus master) to the orphanage of the Ospedale degli Incurabili in Venice.</p><p>It was for the girls of the orphanage that Hasse composed his biblical oratorio Serpentes Ignei in Deserto (1734), to a text in Latin based on the Old Testament st

<p><strong>Wallace Collection, London<br></strong>In this scintillating show, André-Charles Boulle’s sumptuous clocks invite you into an extravagant world of sensuality and dreams</p><p>Thinking about time can make you despair. In art, it often turns up as a reminder of death. Yet walking into the Wallace Collection’s ravishing display of early 18th-century clocks by André-Charles Boulle, you find out that it can be joyous after all. There are no brooding images of mortality and Judgment day here, just dazzling timepieces that tell you to make love, be happy and face down that ticking destiny.</p><p>This small but scintillating show is a time capsule of the Enlightenment and its art style, the Rococo. That may sound like a lot to load on to the clockmaker Boulle, a brilliant craftsman who also made tables, candle stands and whatever else French royalty and nobles desired at his workshop in the Louvre. Yet Boulle and the other ingenious artisans who collaborated with him were interest

<p><strong>O2 Arena, London<br></strong>This rapturously received set of greatest hits showcases the rapper’s full street-hardened and uniquely influential discography – but is it really his final gig?</p><p>You’d be hard-pressed to find another artist who lights a baseball-bat-sized spliff in front of a sold-out O2, while lifting his trousers to reveal an ankle tag. The act earns Nines a £5,000 fine – but he shrugs: “What’s five grand to a trap star like me?” Smoke billows across the screens as Weedman plays.</p><p>This is supposedly the final gig by the west London rapper, who announced his retirement aged 34 with Quit While You’re Ahead, his sixth album in a row to reach the UK Top 5. It was a cohesive body of work, but it lacked a real explanation as to why he’s turning his back on music. Devoted to authentic expressions of himself and the world around him, he always felt free from commercial motives and conventional career arcs.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/202

<p><strong>Chickenshed, London<br></strong>With a huge cast, a somersaulting Peter and pirates crawling menacingly into the audience, Chickenshed’s reworking of JM Barrie’s Christmas staple is sheer magic</p><p>JM Barrie’s tale about the boy who never wants to grow up has delighted audiences and readers since the early 1900s. It is a regular on the Christmas theatre programme but Chickenshed’s adaptation takes Barrie’s original, spins it, and makes it fly above and beyond all that has gone before.</p><p>Chickenshed have stuck to Peter Pan’s roots but made the act of telling stories a bigger feature. There’s a troupe of storytellers from today’s world who swoop into the main scenes to interfere and tug at their seams. But Peter Pan, Wendy and the rest of the Darling family remain familiar. Nana – their lovable dog, who also happens to be the children’s nanny – takes the form of a puppet made out of shredded strips of paper and is animated into life. Peter Pan, played by Demar Lambert

Edward Berger’s drama is adapted with masterly flair by screenwriter Peter Straughan from the Robert Harris pageturner; Ralph Fiennes is on sumptuous form as the deeply troubled Cardinal Lawrence at the centre of a murky Vatican plot. The result is a high-camp gripper, like the world’s most serious Carry On film.</p><p>Fiennes’ character is Italian in Harris’s book, but Straughan makes him an Englishman: an unquiet soul who is theoretically on the verge of becoming the first English pope since Adrian IV, although no one is so vulgar or nationalistic as to point that out. With the ailing pope in extremis, Cardinal Lawrence arrives at His Holiness’s death bed to find other ambitious cardinals, who have all cultivated an opaque
