A study in the Red Sea has shown that satellite-tagged green turtles can map seagrass meadows more accurately than conventional satellite imagery. By tracking 53 turtles, the researchers uncovered 34 new seagrass patches. This method not only overcomes the challenges of existing mapping technologies but also aids in conserving these vital ecosystems that support biodiversity and carbon storage.

A study has confirmed that terrestrial microbes colonised a Ryugu asteroid sample after its return to Earth in 2020. The micro-organisms were found to proliferate upon exposure to Earth's atmosphere, raising concerns over contamination risks in planetary exploration. Published in Meteoritics & Planetary Science, the findings underline the need for robust protocols to protect space samples. Scientists continue to analyse asteroid material to minimise contamination in future missions.
