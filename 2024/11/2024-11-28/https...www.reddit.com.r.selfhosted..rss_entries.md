I&#39;m currently running it in a Docker container on a Ubuntu 22.04 host, which has worked out fine for the most part.</p> <p>The problem started with my hardware acceleration config. I just shared out my Jellyfin server with a friend, and their client device does not support direct streaming for HDR content, so my server needs to transcode. Apparently this was an issue with the Hardware Acceleration/QSV so I spent about 6 hours troubleshooting. GPU pass thru (Intel Core i7-1165G7 [4c/8t] Iris Xe) with drivers and all seem to function fine, as the device is seen on /dev/dri/renderD128 by the container and it is able to leverage it for hardware acceleration to transcode HEVC/H.265/H.264 content for streaming over the internet. </p> <p>So 1080p/SDR, and 4K/SDR content all work fine. The problem is with 4K/HDR content.

I plan to set up SMB shares here for file storage.</li> <li>Mac Mini: For the main server, I’m planning to get the base model M4 Mac Mini, with the 10Gb Ethernet upgrade and a memory upgrade to 24GB. This choice is mainly due to the power efficiency of the Mac Mini, as well as the ability to run LLMs (Large Language Models) locally. <ul> <li>I’m thinking of hosting a local LLM (possibly a 7B model). Is a 7B model still enough for basic tasks in 2024, or should I go for something larger?</li> </ul></li> <li>Docker Containers: I&#39;ll be running Immich (self-hosted photo management) and potentially other services i

I can&#39;t get it to work.</p> <p>My server is an AlmaLinux VPS. I have NPM up and running and have Apache running behind it and serving some web pages but my attempts to get ocserv working have failed. NPM is Docker. Apache and ocserv are currently installed directly on the server but I&#39;m not opposed to switching to Docker for them.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/jeffshead"> /u/jeffshead </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1h1kui1/openconnect_vpn_ocserv_behind_nginx_proxy_manager/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1h1kui1/openconnect_vpn_ocserv_behind_nginx_proxy_manager/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I use external email service for incoming and outgoing email. I do have local setup using iRedmail. All my devices are using iRedmail for IMAP and SMTP. Getmail pops email from external at 5 minutes interval and stores locally and postfix is using external for SMTP relay. It works great but just the 5 minutes delay.</p> <p>I was wondering if there is a way to kind of overlay external on top of internal IMAP to avoid any delays.</p> <p>Thanks</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Inevitable_Ad261"> /u/Inevitable_Ad261 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1h1kaz7/overlay_for_imap/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1h1kaz7/overlay_for_imap/">[comments]</a></span>

## How to self-host private services? (from code)

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi. I have some private services that I self-host. I have a question how to organize it better. Basically my private services are scripts that run periodically, do something and write data to SQLite. But there are also services that run all the time. Most of them on Python and Rust.</p> <p>Initially, when I did this, I did it hastily, so I organized the deploy as Docker Compose, which builds the image itself (via <code>build</code> directive). Sometimes I need to update this services, so I do new deploy via <code>docker compose up -d --wait --remove-orphans --build</code>. But that doesn&#39;t look neat, and I&#39;m not comfortable keeping version control for the code (local git, just to remember what changes I made and when).</p> <p>I&#39;m thinking how this could be rewritten, maybe even using tools other than Docker Compose, like k3s / custom images regestry, etc.</p> <p>I&#39;d like to ask for possible solutuons for this. Maybe there is something
