Over the past two months, I\u2019ve contributed to two key projects: a small project where I built 40-50% of the backend from scratch, and a larger, ongoing project where I focused on bug fixing and optimizing code in the final stages before delivery. </p> <p>The biggest achievement from my time here has been learning Django Rest Framework (DRF). I came in with little to no experience in DRF, but after working on both projects, I gained significant knowledge and confidence in using it. I\u2019m deeply grateful to my senior for this incredible opportunity to grow. Their guidance and support were key to my learning, and I truly appreciate the trust they placed in me. </p> <p>However, as a final-year student, I\u2019m finding it difficult to balance a full-time office internship with my college schedule, especial",
