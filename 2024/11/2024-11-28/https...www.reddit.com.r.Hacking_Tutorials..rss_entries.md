<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Sorry if this is the wrong sub for this question. I read an interesting article about planting root shells in foreign systems, and i was wondering what you could do with it? I know it gives you admin privileges, but what/how would you be able to do? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Quick_Boss_7188"> /u/Quick_Boss_7188 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking_Tutorials/comments/1h27w6n/what_can_one_do_with_a_remote_root_shell/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking_Tutorials/comments/1h27w6n/what_can_one_do_with_a_remote_root_shell/">[comments]</a></span>

Custom images for esp32 are also available. To sum it up, using only a smartphone, all the Wi-Fi signals that you walk by is collected (bssid, Mac, gps location) and you can upload it to wigle.net in order to view your data as a map.</p> <p>I have an entire playlist related to this topic on my channel, so please feel free to check it up or ask any questions.</p> <p><a href="h

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So i was watching a youtube video by <a href="https://youtu.be/j84gB2cbNps?si=oOeYxg-hlLbo1ipU">No Text to Speech</a> about the andrew tate website hack. In the video he talks about how the hackers gained complete control of the website using a command on the browser console that he simply labelled as godmod = 1; so that he doesnt get into any kind of legal trouble. I was curious to know about this command if anyone could held.<br/> ThankYou:)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Nikhilguleria124"> /u/Nikhilguleria124 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking_Tutorials/comments/1h201h5/question_regarding_a_godmode_1_command/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking_Tutorials/comments/1h201h5/question_regarding_a_godmode_1_command/">[comments]</a></span>

The apk is downloaded and installed on a Rooted Pixel 3. Using Termux and the curl cmd, I can&#39;t connect to LHOST | PORT. Is it the reason nothing is happening on the computer. I feel like it could be from the phone&#39;s side since everything seems to work on the VM. Is the msf6 default payload outdated? Should I use TheFatRat app? I have more trouble with FatRat, but it&#39;s more recent.</p> <p>Thanks for the help</p> <p>Additional
