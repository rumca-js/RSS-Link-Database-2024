<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I was thinking about this yesterday and was curious what others do. If you sample books before reading them (whether physical or Kindle samples), do you sample before picking up your next read? Sample separately to create a more curated TBR you pull from? Or something else entirely?</p> <p>I know some don&#39;t sample at all, and just pick up their next read, but I&#39;m still learning my tastes a bit so I&#39;ve been bitten by this a bunch (which has probably made me more anxious or picky about doing so!). I tend to sample before I pick up my next read, but I find myself more and more just sampling instead of committing to something, trying to find the &quot;perfect&quot; next book. So I&#39;ve been thinking about switching to doing it on the side to create more of a TBR to pull from. However, maybe I&#39;ll find some inspiration here!</p> <p>To those in the US, happy Thanksgiving if you celebrate!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <

He says Tigana by Guy Gavriel Kay is his all time favorite book, but he also loves The Lord of Rings and Hobbit. He also is a big fan of the Wheel of Time series and Brandon Sanderson’s other books. He’s read a lot of Robbin Hobb this year and has enjoyed her books. He read a few of the Discworld books and liked them my only concern with getting those for him is there are so many mini series within the larger universe and I have no idea which he has read or wants to read.</p> <p>Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Basic_Experience_964"> /u/Basic_Experience_964 </a> <br/>

A woman found her soulmate, a man, who she had a vision was going to be shot in some brawl. The season ended with the woman and man discovering they were born in the same place at almost the same exact time, making them soulmates or something 🤷🏻‍♀️ I believe it was a one season show. </p> <p>Help!!!
