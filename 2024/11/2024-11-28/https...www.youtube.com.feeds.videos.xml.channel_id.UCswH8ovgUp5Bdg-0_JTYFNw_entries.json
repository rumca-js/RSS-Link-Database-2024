We delve into her latest projects, including the groundbreaking Peterson Academy, which is reshaping online education, and her reflections on the shifting cultural and political landscape in America. Mikhaila opens up about her journey into faith, her recent baptism, and how it has reframed her understanding of good, evil, and personal responsibility. We also discuss her unique dietary philosophy, the challenges of managing public attention, and her vision for fostering reconciliation and dialogue in an increasingly divided world. This conversation touches on faith, freedom, and the role of independent media in shaping a more open and honest discours",
