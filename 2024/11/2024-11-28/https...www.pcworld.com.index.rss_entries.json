You could leave it at that and get watching, but you\u2019re going to find yourself back shopping again for TV accessories soon enough.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m talking about a good quality soundbar and TV backlighting kit to make your TV experience like the movies. Ideally, you\u2019ll want a wall mount or a stand to position your TV where you need it. A HDMI cable will allow you to use peripherals like your gaming console and PC with your TV. What\u2019s more, you\u2019re going to need a surge protector and screen cleaning kit to look after your new device.
