By tracking 53 turtles, the researchers uncovered 34 new seagrass patches. This method not only overcomes the challenges of existing mapping technologies but also aids in conserving these vital ecosystems that support biodiversity and carbon storage.",

With more than 40 gold veins containing up to 1,100 tons of gold, this find could potentially be the largest known gold deposit on Earth. The discovery has significantly impacted global gold prices, pushing them close to record highs. While this deposit will help meet China\u2019s growing demand, it will only cover its consumption for about 1.4 years.",

Charcoal found in herbivorous dinosaurs' dung suggests detoxification strategies to counter toxins from certain ferns, a survival trait crucial during a time of environmental upheaval.",
