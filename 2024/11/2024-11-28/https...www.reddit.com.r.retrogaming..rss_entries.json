Right now, I have a large power strip with metal pieces that screw in to stop them from being pulled out by accident. I also have some cable covers so I can combine related cords (e.g. power cords, etc.). But it&#39;s still a mess. If anyone has advice on how best to wrangle the d*mn things, I would be grateful to hear it. For the record, I&#39;m looking to replicate the setup I had years ago with 8 different systems: back then, I just cared about playing, but I want it to look nice like several posts I&#39;ve seen here.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/welcomeOhm\"> /u/welcomeOhm </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1h28j5l/ah_cords_we_meet_again/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1h28j5l/ah_cords_we_meet_again/\">[comments]</a></span>",
