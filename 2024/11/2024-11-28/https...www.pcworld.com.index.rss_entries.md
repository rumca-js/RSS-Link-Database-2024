<p>Like most tech products, TVs get the full Black Friday treatment, meaning you can snap up a bargain-basement OLED or QLED TV for next to nothing. You could leave it at that and get watching, but you’re going to find yourself back shopping again for TV accessories soon enough.</p>



<p>I’m talking about a good quality soundbar and TV backlighting kit to make your TV experience like the movies. Ideally, you’ll want a wall mount or a stand to position your TV where you need it. A HDMI cable will allow you to use peripherals like your gaming console and PC with your TV. What’s more, you’re going to need a surge protector and screen cleaning kit to look after your new device. Here we simplify your search with a list of the top 10 must-have TV accessories.</p>
