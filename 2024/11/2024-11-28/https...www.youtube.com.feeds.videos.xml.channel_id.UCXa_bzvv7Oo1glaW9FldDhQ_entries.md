EA Sports has dominated the football sim scene with EA Sports FC (formerly FIFA) for as long as anyone can remember, while Konami has also enjoyed its fair share of success in the genre as well, but beyond that, competition has usually been pretty sparse- especially now. 

UFL, however, is a game that many have been keeping an eye on for some time now. Announced a couple of years ago, the game has actually been in development for eight, and its developer, Strikerz has made some bold and lofty promises. 

Whether the game can live up to them remains to be seen, but with its launch approaching, here, we’re covering some key details that you should know to get yourself prepared for what it will have in store.

Whether it's the early days or modern gaming, survival horror usually evokes two big names - Resident Evil and Silent Hill. The 2000s had their share of new properties, including Computer Artworks' The Thing stood out. Thanks to Nightdive Studios, it's getting a remaster this year on Xbox Series X/S, PS5, PS4, Xbox One, PC, and Nintendo Switch.

A release date has yet to be announced yet The Thing: Remastered will feature 4K resolution and 144 FPS support on current-gen alongside improved character models, textures, animations, lighting, and atmospheric effects. 

Areas that felt rough in the original will be polished up while Achievements are incoming for Xbox, PlayStation, and PC.
