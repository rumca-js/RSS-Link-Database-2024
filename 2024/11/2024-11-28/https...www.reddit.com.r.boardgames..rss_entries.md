The company has assured me the new card is on the way however in the meantime I’d love to play the game while waiting. I feel like only a single missing card shouldn’t have a huge effect however I have only read the rules and don’t want to have a poor experience.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m looking for a game (board or card or whatever) for Christmas with the family. We&#39;re all 30 and over at this point. HOWEVER. Some of us are old enough and crotchety enough that it can be a pain to find something they enjoy. For instance, a couple of years ago we tried Munchkin, and the Kneepads of Allure damn near caused an actual brawl because Uncle Kurt did NOT want to give Aunt Diane any help, and didn&#39;t see why he should have to. This should have been hilarious to observers, but honestly it just made me anxious. </p> <p>Anyway, they&#39;re in their 70s and anything with more than a few rules is just too much for them, and they don&#39;t like stuff where you have to keep count. So games where that sort of thing is optional would be great. They&#39;re just suffering from a severe case of <em>old</em>. </p> <p>Exploding Kittens was not a success.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>A few years ago I played a game and I don’t recall the name. It was a trivia game with 2 teams of equal number of players. The teams take turns drawing a card with a category on it and the members of the team have to take turns naming one of the things from the category (eg. naming all the Beatles, all the oceans, all the toppings on a Chicago hot dog). If team 1 had players A B and C, they could select the order, but they have to keep naming things in that order (obviously no discussing answers beforehand). If one player gave an incorrect clue the team didn’t get any points. Alternatively, the team could choose to stop in the middle of the round to save the points they had made so far.

Has anyone tried this? with one or both expansions. How did it go? was it too hard and/or chaotic?</p> <p>I am also wondering how much to increase the tracker, my first instinct was increasing it by the same % as the number of tiles, but then I thought about the fact that the game usually progresses quickly as you start and then slows down as you need to do more backtracking and hit point management. So maybe the tracker would need to be increased furt

I can think of three.</p> <ol> <li><p>When Agricola came out, it came with a huge pile of cubes and cardboard punch outs. People who got a special promo copy got meeples shaped like animals and vegetables. FOMO ran wild and everybody wanted meeples that were actually shaped like something instead of just cubes. There was a huge secondary market for bootleg meeples. Before that, cubes were the norm and after that people were not satisfied with cubes anymore.</p></li> <li><p>Pandemic made co-op games huge. Before that, they were rare. It also introduced me and a lot of other people to solo gaming. I remember sitting at the table, looking at it after everyone else got up to go do something and realizing that I could just play it again by myself.</p></li> <li><p>Dominion launched a lot of deck builders. For me, that’s when card-based games really broke through in the boardgaming community.</p></li>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>For context, I buy the translated version, but some of the translated rules aren&#39;t clear. My words for some cards/tokens may not be correct in English.</p> <p>When you collect the green cards (race cards) to obtain the little shield/race token, can the cards be used again to obtain another token? For example, I get a second dwarf card and obtain 1 dwarf token. Then I get an elf card and a hobbit card. Can I reuse the dwarf card again to obtain another token with the 3 different race card rule?</p> <p>Thank you for the answer in advance.
