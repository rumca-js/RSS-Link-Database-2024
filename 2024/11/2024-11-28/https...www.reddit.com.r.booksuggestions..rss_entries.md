<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m after something mature in theme and tone, science fictiony leaning into modern/urban/dystopian fantasy (though light on the science is preferable, hard is okay too if it works in the rest of the context). Elements of surrealism or absurdism are important, as are elements of cosmic horror, though the book need not fall into either of those genres per se. If the book is set somewhere like the real world, but darker, like a fantasy version of our world corrupted.</p> <p>Some books I&#39;ve read recently that almost but don&#39;t quite fit what I&#39;m after are Murakami&#39;s 1q84, Zoo City by Lauren Buekes or Someplace to be Flying by Charles De Lint.

I am having some paralysis by analysis because of all the options that are out there.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi, so I am a whole new reader and I am enjoying myself reading fiction books with stories , earlier I was more into self help but now fiction works good with me. I have just finished &quot;When the coffee gets cold&quot; And its very good emotional collection of story beautifully translated and written. Suggest me some more fresh books to read keeping in mind, I am a new reader and I don&#39;t want to overwhelm myself with long difficult to read literature. Hope you get what I mean.

## How have books helped you learn about human relationships?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello, everyone I&#39;ve been very curious about this for a while and its my first time posting something, how have books helped you learn about human relationships (how we connect and communicate)? I&#39;m not talking about self help or psychology books, just &quot;regular&quot; books (not sure how to phrase it). Did seeing the way two characters communicate or fought teach you something? I think the most typical answer I&#39;ve heard is empathy and if that goes for you, would you please be able to elaborate? And if you can use example of books you&#39;ve read as well, I would like the recommendations. Thank you. </p> <p>I apologize if my English is bad</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/IntelligentJob7688"> /u/IntelligentJob7688 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1h1ntxl/how_have_books_helped_you_learn_about_human/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="ht

She likes a thriller, and when we first met she loved the bronze horsemen - Russian history also being a fascination of hers. She doesn&#39;t mind a bit of humour - particular British. Not the biggest fan of non-fiction works however or autobiographical ones.</p> <p>
