Hallmark Christmas movies are a hugely successful business for them, so it’s only natural that Netflix is trying to get a piece of that pie. With movies like The Princess Switch and A Christmas Prince in the past few years, they’re not heading into the realm of magic with Hot Frosty, which isn’t as gross as it sounds! 

Follow along as a hot snowman who was literally born yesterday is lusted after by a bunch of old ladies and then dies in front of everyone but then wakes up and goes to Hawaii!

So check out the pitch meeting that led to Hot Frosty, to find out how it all came together!
