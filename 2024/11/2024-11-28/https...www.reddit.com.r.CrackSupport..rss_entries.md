I previously played the game on a pirated version (FitGirl Assassin’s Creed: Odyssey – Ultimate Edition – v1.5.3 + All DLCs). I believe the only difference from the fitgirls version to the original is the Korfu Island dlc but im not sure.</p> <p>I really enjoy the game, and now i can afford to buy it. But i don&#39;t want to start from 0. </p> <p>I’m wondering if it’s possible to transfer my save files from the pirated version to the legitimate one.</p> <p>So.. is it possible? where are the save files and where should i put it? do i need to edit anything? like steam id or uplay id(i saw on fitgirl site that my version is Based on Uplay v1.5.3 rip)</p> <p>Thanks in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/flocki_"> /u/flocki_ </a> <br/> <span><a href="http

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I was looking for a free rar decompressor (not sure if that&#39;s what it&#39;s properly called) to unpack a rar file of about 40-50gb from steamrip. </p> <p>Couldn&#39;t find one on browser that would unpack the file of that size for free, so i reached out on steamrip reddit and they reccomended 7zip. I just want to know if it is safe and the correct website to ddownload it from if so. </p> <p>Also if steamrip is suspicious please let me know</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Darkstreamer_101"> /u/Darkstreamer_101 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CrackSupport/comments/1h1p7xa/is_7zip_safe_and_the_correct_place_to_download_it/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CrackSupport/comments/1h1p7xa/is_7zip_safe_and_the_correct_place_to_download_it/">[comments]</a></span>
