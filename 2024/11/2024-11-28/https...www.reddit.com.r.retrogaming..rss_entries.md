<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I only have a few systems, but managing the cords has still been a challenge. Right now, I have a large power strip with metal pieces that screw in to stop them from being pulled out by accident. I also have some cable covers so I can combine related cords (e.g. power cords, etc.). But it&#39;s still a mess. If anyone has advice on how best to wrangle the d*mn things, I would be grateful to hear it. For the record, I&#39;m looking to replicate the setup I had years ago with 8 different systems: back then, I just cared about playing, but I want it to look nice like several posts I&#39;ve seen here.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/welcomeOhm"> /u/welcomeOhm </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1h28j5l/ah_cords_we_meet_again/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1h28j5l/ah_cords_we_meet_again/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Grim Fandango deals with Mexican folklore, specifically the Day of the Dead and the traditional belief that a person must journey four long years through the Land of the Dead to get to her final resting place, unless she led a very good life. The story weaved through this tradition is fantastic. It evokes a film noir feel, with some similaries to Casablanca, especially in year two. Peter McConnell’s score is one of LucasArts’ best, which is saying something, as most of their games have had exceptional music. <a href="https://youtu.be/0cgwnlYW0Bw">https://youtu.be/0cgwnlYW0Bw</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Westraat1"> /u/Westraat1 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1h1pxj3/grim_fandango_the_movie/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1h1pxj3/grim_fandango_the_movie/">[comments]</a></span>
