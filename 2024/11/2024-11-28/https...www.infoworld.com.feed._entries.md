<p>Word that a group of former Google executives plans to build an operating system for AI agents underscores the fact that there is a distinction between what application platforms are doing with agents today and what an AI agent-first OS would entail, said industry analyst Brian Jackson.</p>



<p>Jackson, principal research director at Info-Tech Research Group, said Wednesday that the OSes we use today “were built for a software architecture that is file-based and designed to be used with a computer and a mouse. An OS that is built around AI could look at defining computing as data-based, with intelligent models that continuously learn and adapt based on new data.”</p>

<p>Uber no longer offers just rides and deliveries: It’s created a new division hiring out gig workers to help enterprises with some of their AI model development work.</p>



<p>Scaled Solutions grew out of the company’s own needs for data annotation, testing, and localization, and is now ready to offer those services to enterprises in retail, automotive and autonomous vehicles, social media, consumer apps, generative AI, manufacturing, and customer support. Its first customers include Aurora Innovation, which makes self-driving software for commercial trucks, and game developer Niantic, which is building a 3D map of the world.</p>

<p>In the C# programming language, <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2245856/how-to-work-with-structs-in-c.html">structs</a> or structure types are value types that allow faster access because they are usually stored in the stack. However, although structs reduce memory footprints and eliminate garbage collection overheads, they are not a good choice in high-performance scenarios where memory allocation and deallocation in the stack is critical.</p>



<p>In such scenerios, C# provides a better alternative called a ref struct. Whereas both structs and ref structs are allocated in the stack and don’t require garbage collection, there are subtle differences between the two types and their u
