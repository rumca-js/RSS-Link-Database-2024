Great intro.</p><p>Hello, fellow night owls (in the UK), and welcome to our coverage of the second day\u2019s play at the Hagley Oval. Christchurch looked a picture yesterday, and the game was pretty decent, too. New Zealand were 199 for three on a pitch that was green but hardly treacherous before England snapped back, Shoaib Bashir sneaking in an opening day four-for and Brydon Carse looking more and more like a very serious Test bowler. It ended 319 for eight, the visitors probably a touch happier.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2024/nov/28/new-zealand-v-england-first-mens-cricket-test-day-two-live\">Continue reading...</a>",
