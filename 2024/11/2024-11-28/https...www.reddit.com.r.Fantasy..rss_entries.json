Or something else entirely?</p> <p>I know some don&#39;t sample at all, and just pick up their next read, but I&#39;m still learning my tastes a bit so I&#39;ve been bitten by this a bunch (which has probably made me more anxious or picky about doing so!). I tend to sample before I pick up my next read, but I find myself more and more just sampling instead of committing to something, trying to find the &quot;perfect&quot; next book. So I&#39;ve been thinking about switching to doing it on the side to create more of a TBR to pull from.

He says Tigana by Guy Gavriel Kay is his all time favorite book, but he also loves The Lord of Rings and Hobbit. He also is a big fan of the Wheel of Time series and Brandon Sanderson\u2019s other books. He\u2019s read a lot of Robbin Hobb this year and has enjoyed her books. He read a few of the Discworld books and liked them my only concern with getting those for him is there are so many mini series within the larger universe and I have no idea which he has read or wants to read.</p> <p>Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Basic_Experience_964\"> /u/Basic_Experience_964 </a> <br/>",

But I had a difficult childhood and as I became a teenager I stopped reading fantasy at all. I think I just became too cynical?? As a kid, fantasy books gave me so much hope and such an escape, but as time passed and I realized I couldn\u2019t escape the environment I was in, I just wasn\u2019t able to ever get back into the genre. </p> <p>Now as an adult, I really want to try it again! I miss the way it used to make me feel and I want to get that feeling back\u2014 are there any fantasy books you\u2019d recommend to get me back into the genre? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Psychological-Ant340\"> /u/Psychological-Ant340 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1h1mbh4/good_books_to_get_me_back_into_fantasy/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1",

The Sun Eater series has been recommended a number of times. Here&#39;s my issue: I don&#39;t want a completely depressing or nihilistic series, and that is somewhat how it has been described to me. I can handle a lot (Red Rising isn&#39;t exactly an emotional walk in the park), but I need at least an undercurrent of hope.
