Back to Basics: Debugging and Testing in C++ Software Development - Greg Law & Mike Shah - CppCon 24
---

Your code is not working -- PANIC! Well, not quite! In this session we are going to show you how to write tests to uncover bugs in the first place (and to guard against regressions when they’re fixed) and how to identify the bugs’ root causes with a debugger. These two fundamental software engineering skills (debugging and testing) in combination helps us write better software by improving our confidence that bugs do not reappear -- especially as software scales and changes over time. Debugging and testing are two related skillsets, and in this talk we will provide an introduction and concrete tools showing by example how to utilize each skill together. If you have never used a debugger and think ‘if it compiles it must work’ then this is the talk for you.
