Something that is driving them to commit acts of heinous violence.</p> <p>Created by scientists, it is let loose in the town in a terrifying conspiracy, it can unlock the human mind&#39;s most deadly potential. And now a few innocent people are caught in a nightmare that is all too real, with death being the only cure.</p> <p>This one&#39;s pretty tight and a little bit shorter, at about 308 pages. But it is very fast paced, a real pressure cooker of a story that builds up really quickly. And there are some pretty brutal moments in this book too, and I do mean brutal!

It seems like the entire book was basically different characters lamenting on Oscars inability to get laid. This is most prevalent with yunior, of course, but it still feels like that&#39;s the main premise of the book. Of course, it delves into drug cartels, South American culture, sexism; I mean, I understand that the book explores those themes, but I didn&#39;t really get anything from the books exploration of them. To me, it all sort of fell flat, and it felt like the overarching premise of the whole story really just revolves around Oscar and his lack of charisma.
