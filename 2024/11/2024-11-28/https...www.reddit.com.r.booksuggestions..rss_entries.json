Elements of surrealism or absurdism are important, as are elements of cosmic horror, though the book need not fall into either of those genres per se. If the book is set somewhere like the real world, but darker, like a fantasy version of our world corrupted.</p> <p>Some books I&#39;ve read recently that almost but don&#39;t quite fit what I&#39;m after are Murakami&#39;s 1q84, Zoo City by Lauren Buekes or Someplace to be Flying by Charles De Lint.

I am having some paralysis by analysis because of all the options that are out there.

She likes a thriller, and when we first met she loved the bronze horsemen - Russian history also being a fascination of hers. She doesn&#39;t mind a bit of humour - particular British. Not the biggest fan of non-fiction works however or autobiographical ones.</p> <p>",

One is a new 13yo and 7th grader with pretty broad interests. He liked the Dog Man and Cat Kid series when he was younger. Very boisterous and charismatic personality. </p> <p>His brother is 10 and a bit behind on language I think. He is a quiet and dreamy kid and I think he likes things that are funny. Also a fan of Dog Man, etc. </p> <p>I think they have also done Diary of a Wimpy Kid together. </p> <p>BONUS POINTS if the recommendations have decent girl characters that co-exist in the story. It can&#39;t be overtly feminist because I don&#39;t want to make waves with my in-laws. Please don&#39;t hate on my family dynamics, they are what they are. I&#39;m just looking for material that will help provide some well rounded ideas to them without being political. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/gugalgirl\"> /u/gugalgirl ",

A non-photo book would work too, but it&#39;s hard to find one that he has not already read. I swear this boy has read every book under the sun. He is a huge fan of old comedy and film-he has a poster of W.C. Fields, loves old abbott and costello/steve Martin sketches, loves classic movies, is a big fan of shows like columbo, etc. It seems like he generally loves comedy/film from the 1930s-1970s. If anyone has recommendations for books, or photography books, that would be a good gift for him let me know!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Rinrin108\"> /u/Rinrin108 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1h1iz57/looking_for_coffee_table_books_for_comedyfilm/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestion",
