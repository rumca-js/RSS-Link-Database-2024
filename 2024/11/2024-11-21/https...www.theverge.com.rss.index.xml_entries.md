  <p id="3xASUG">A federal lawsuit over Minnesota’s “Use of Deep Fake Technology to Influence An Election” law is now directly dealing with the influence of AI. In a recent filing, attorneys challenging the law say an affidavit submitted to support it shows signs of containing AI-generated text. <a href="https://minnesotareformer.com/2024/11/20/misinformation-expert-cites-non-existent-sources-in-minnesota-deep-fake-case/"><em>The Minnesota Reformer</em> reports</a> Attorney General Keith Ellison asked Stanford Social Media Lab founding director Jeff Hancock to make the submission, but the document filed includes non-existent sources that seem to have been hallucinated by ChatGPT or

  <p id="f7LsLU">Meta is making a big change to Threads to show you more things from people you follow.</p>
<p id="01cxyD">“We are rebalancing ranking to prioritize content from people you follow, which will mean less recommended content from accounts you don’t follow and more posts from the accounts you do starting today,” Threads boss Adam Mosseri <a href="https://www.threads.net/@mosseri/post/DCo4WiOvCB0">announced on Thursday</a>.</p>
<p id="aIbfnN">The change could make the For You feed include more accounts you actually care about, but we’ll have to wait and see if the update addresses the problem of the feed surfacing posts that are very old and no longer timely
