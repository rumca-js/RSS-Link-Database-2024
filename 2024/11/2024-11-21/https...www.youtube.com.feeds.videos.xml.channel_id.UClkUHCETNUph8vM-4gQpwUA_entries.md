NEW AVOWED GAMEPLAY - I Played 8 MORE Hours - It's NOT What I THOUGHT...
In this video, I'm going to be talking about my gameplay impressions with Avowed. Over the last couple of days or so. I got to play about 8 to 10 hours of this. So in this video, I want to go over what exactly Avowed is and I'm going to give you more information the about gameplay loop, open-world nature and other game mechanics that we couldn't deduce from the gameplay session at Gamescom simply because there wasn't enough time and because we only saw a very small segment of the game. Hands-On new Gameplay Preview

Shout out to Xbox who was kind enough to send us a copy of the preview build of the game to check out.
