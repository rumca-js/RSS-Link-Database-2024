Joe: Wrath of Cobra sits somewhere near the back of the pack in quality. Still, this valiant attempt should be recognized, especially for its success capturing the identity of the G.I. Joe brand well. \n\nAll the traditional trademarks of the genre are here. Levels progress from left to right as you stomp your way through waves of enemy Cobra soldiers and pick up guns and health packs along the way. \n\nCouch co-op or online play is probably going to supply more fun than solo runs, but either way, Wrath of Cobra offers a decent romp. The lacking boss fights and poor variety hold this back from earning a permanent spot in the arcade section of my PS5 library. Still, the basic enjoyment of the simplistic gameplay and the charming audio/visuals should be worth your time if you\u2019re a fan of the genre or IP.", "id": 1562181, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBQ4EvwcPCM", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 129, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/HBQ4EvwcPCM/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "G.I.

Aspects such as realism, attention to detail, and story remain unsurpassed in many gamers\u2019 minds regarding RDR 2. \n\nBut GTA 6 may have what it takes to dethrone it based on its franchise pedigree and concept.
