In this class we'll discuss how the Architecture of a Web App actually works. We'll discuss everything from the Front End, to the Back End Languages, Data Stores, Databases, Caching Systems, Web Servers and more.

We'll talk about maintenance overhead, security concerns and the all important TCO.

When you build your web application it's important to design and code it for the environment that it will be dropped into. A lot of time and money can be wasted by simply building off out based off of poorly thought out ideas.

We will discuss:

Front End Design
Back end languages
Data Stores
Databases
Concepts in Security
Thinking about ongoing maintenance
Understanding Cachin
