The company then pledged to do better [&#8230;]

For years, a vocal group of self-described &#8220;contrarian&#8221; Substackified pundits warned about a supposed &#8220;censorship industrial complex&#8221; involving collusion between the White House and social media companies to set content moderation policies.

When we and others discussed the massive trademark lawsuit between Molson Coors, makers of Keystone beer amongst other brands, and Stone Brewing, it was billed as a David versus Goliath scenario.
