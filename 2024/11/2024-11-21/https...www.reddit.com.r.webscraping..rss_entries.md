<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey!</p> <p>I have a lot of experiences doing webscrappers. However, there&#39;s some websites that don&#39;t really expose an API on the network tab. Sometimes, all I can see is the doc type, with all the data loaded in the HTML.</p> <p>This is a major blocker, because then I have to parse an HTML. So I was wondering... Does anyone knows other ways to find the API calls being made for this doc? Maybe by finding the JS that makes the call somewhere else?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SearchinglyWonderful"> /u/SearchinglyWonderful </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1gwq239/scrape_underlying_api_through_a_doc/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1gwq239/scrape_underlying_api_through_a_doc/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello. Good day everyone.</p> <p>I am trying to reverse engineer a major website&#39;s API using pure HTTP requests. I chose Python&#39;s requests module as my go-to technology to work with because I&#39;m familiar with Python. But I am wondering how good is Python&#39;s requests at being undetected and mimicking a browser..? If it&#39;s a no go, could you maybe suggest a technology that is light on bandwidth, uses only HTTP requests without loading a browser&#39;s driver, and stealthy.</p> <p>Thanks</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/_iamhamza_"> /u/_iamhamza_ </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1gwks5g/how_good_is_pythons_requests_at_being_undetected/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1gwks5g/how_good_is_pythons_requests_at_being_undetected/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>In Switzerland we have two monopoly supermarkets and it sucks (Migros and COOP) and other cheaper supermarket brands (ALDI, LIDL for example) that are trying to enter the market but with difficulty. I&#39;m trying to build a project to compare the product prices of common goods of these mastodons with the concurrence to make the price difference transparent for the public.</p> <p>It was easy to webscrap the first site of migros (<a href="https://www.migros.ch/">https://www.migros.ch/</a>), but with the second one, (<a href="https://www.coop.ch/">https://www.coop.ch/</a>), I&#39;m facing a captcha blocker that I can&#39;t overcome...

## 100% Stealth for Small Scale?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Need to collect small amount of data, just a couple thousands requests, so don&#39;t need proxy, IP, multiple instances etc. Just a very slow single instance, doing 1 req every 5 sec or so, slowly doing the job in a couple of days.</p> <p>But the `puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth` doesn&#39;t work (it&#39;s immediately detected as bot and blocked by site). Wonder if there&#39;s simple tool that is: <strong>stealth</strong> and also has <strong>file download</strong> and <strong>request interception</strong> support? Ideally JS/TS, not Python.</p> <p>P.S.</p> <p>Also, I just wonder if there&#39;s any way to use the real Chrome/Firefox browser directly? Like maybe as a Plugin by injecting JS into page that would control it and clearing cookie and all the other data every 10 requests + node.js proxy to use for request introspection? Or something like that.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/h234sd"> /u/h
