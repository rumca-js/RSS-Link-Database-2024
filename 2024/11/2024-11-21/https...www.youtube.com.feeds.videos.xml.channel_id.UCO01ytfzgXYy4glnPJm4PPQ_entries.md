Today on the Matt Walsh Show, there was a hearing in Congress yesterday to debate a Republican bill that would abolish DEI in the federal government. Various Democrat lawmakers presented their best arguments for keeping DEI intact—and their best arguments are extremely stupid. Also, the trans lawmaker in Congress backs down and admits defeat in the bathroom fight. And Jaguar puts out the most unintentionally hilarious woke ad we've maybe ever seen.
