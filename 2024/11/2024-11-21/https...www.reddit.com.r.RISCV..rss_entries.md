<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everybody, so I&#39;ve been very lightly following the new RISC V stuff coming out and find it super fascinating but don&#39;t have enough time to get into it myself. My cousins eldest son is kinda into tech stuff like me but more into gaming and tweaking settings etc.. I was thinking of buying him a board for christmas but I&#39;m not too sure if he&#39;ll actually like it. Do you guys think it&#39;s a bit difficult for a 13 year old to get into? If not what are some good boards that are like around 100 euros/dollars. If you read all of this thank you for your time! I&#39;m really trying to be the cool cousin this year hahahahahah</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Pascal_Human"> /u/Pascal_Human </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1gw3k3z/christmas_gift_for_a_cousin/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1gw3k3z/christmas_gi
