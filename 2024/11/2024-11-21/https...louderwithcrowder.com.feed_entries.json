When he first ran for president, people would attempt to sell me on him by saying, \"You're a wrestling fan; you should get what he's doing.\" It's fascinating to look back on those conversations eight years later. Trump is about to start his second turn as president. The Undertaker's brother has since been elected Mayor in Tennessee. And Linda McMahon, the former CEO of the WWE, has been named as the incoming Secretary of Education.</p><p>Which hopefully means she'll be shutting down the Department of Education.
