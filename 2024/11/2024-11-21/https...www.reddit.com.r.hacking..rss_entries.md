<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi, I am brand new to password cracking and have limited experience.</p> <p>I have an old fire alarm panel that is protected with a 5 digit numbers only password (00000-99999). It utilizes a program I have on my laptop to make changes/reprogram but any changes require a password be entered. The password was lost long ago and the company that makes the panel went out of business, so their tech support is nonexistent. What would be my best approach or tool to brute force this?</p> <p>I&#39;m not super savvy when it comes to using the command window so anything as user friendly as possible is appreciated. </p> <p>I&#39;m open to free or paid applications.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/CarbonCharger"> /u/CarbonCharger </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1gwq8rm/seeking_advice_on_cracking_fire_alarm_panel/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi,</p> <p>So getting into my first BIOS hacking. In short need it for something called Resizeable BAR support on a server board I have that should very much have support for it and the chipset is guaranteed capable but the manufacturer just won&#39;t do it. </p> <p>The BIOS update is a zip file which contains random scripts and a .xyz payload. Which contains a .upd payload. Which contains a .tar file which is the actual BIOS. </p> <p>I can modify the contents of the zip (obvs), the .xyz, and I can extract the .tar file and modify it but I can&#39;t modify the .upd archive. </p> <p>Anyone have any utilities that can do this? </p> <p>Disclaimer: This is for a server I own and I know the risks but at this point I need this setting or it&#39;s a paperweight to me anyway. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/jhs0108"> /u/jhs0108 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1gwq4n7/

## New AMSI Bypass Technique Modifying CLR.dll in Memory

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This is sort of a follow-on post to one I made a while back discussing Microsoft’s new behavior detection signatures protecting AMSI API’s (<a href="https://practicalsecurityanalytics.com/obfuscating-api-patches-to-bypass-new-windows-defender-behavior-signatures/">https://practicalsecurityanalytics.com/obfuscating-api-patches-to-bypass-new-windows-defender-behavior-signatures/</a>). I realized that I needed a new technique that could be just as reliable, but harder to detect and mitigate. That led me to attacking CLR.dll.</p> <p>This post will cover how I researched and found something to attack, how I developed the technique, and 3 implementations in C, C#, and PowerShell. Finally, I cover how to integrate the new bypass into an obfuscation pipeline using SpecterInsight’s Payload Pipelines. That allows me to generate new obfuscated payloads by simple clicking one button.</p> <p>Hope you find this useful!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &
