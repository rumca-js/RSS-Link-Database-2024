<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>For me that song is Good Riddance (Time of Your Life) by Green Day. </p> <p>I have a quite good reason on why this song makes me feel sad. My dad and my uncle were very close, and my dad would always tell me some fun stories that him and my uncle did as they were children. According to my dad and all my family, my uncle was a fun guy. Unfortunately I never got to meet my uncle because he passed away from a heart attack before I was born. This song played on the radio one day while me and my mom were driving home and she told me that this song was played at my uncle’s funeral, I never knew that. In that moment I felt sympathy for my father because I knew he loved his brother very much, and then a tear fell from my eye. So every time I hear this song it almost always brings a tear to my eye. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SFDsamfindsdiamonds"> /u/SFDsamfindsdiamonds </a> <br/> <span><a href="http

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Mine is Brian Jones. He wasn’t just a founding member of The Rolling Stones, he was a multi-instrumental genius, bringing in sitar, marimba, and mellotron to create sounds no one else was doing then. His creativity gave the Stones a depth that set them apart early on.</p> <p>I’d also say John Paul Jones from Led Zeppelin deserves more credit. His basslines, keyboard work, and arranging were the glue that held their epic sound together. Honestly, classic rock is full of these unsung heroes who made the music what it was.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Richard Thompson was my first thought: a fantastic guitarist with an immediately identifiable technique but also a good voice and the ability to write great lyrics and melodies. I can&#39;t think of many people who embody this as much as he does.</p> <p>But, then I thought about David Gilmour and Lindsay Buckingham. Both are solid players and strong singers. Gilmour isn&#39;t a lyricist of Roger Waters&#39;s caliber, but he&#39;s pretty good. Buckingham doesn&#39;t always make music I love, but he&#39;s an all-around talent too.</p> <p>Of course, who could forget Prince, who was good at everything? </p> <p>Who else fits the bill here?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/amancalledj"> /u/amancalledj </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1gw2ii1/rock_trifecta_great_rock_guitarists_who_are_also/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1
