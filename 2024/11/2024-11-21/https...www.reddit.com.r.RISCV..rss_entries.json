My cousins eldest son is kinda into tech stuff like me but more into gaming and tweaking settings etc.. I was thinking of buying him a board for christmas but I&#39;m not too sure if he&#39;ll actually like it. Do you guys think it&#39;s a bit difficult for a 13 year old to get into? If not what are some good boards that are like around 100 euros/dollars. If you read all of this thank you for your time! I&#39;m really trying to be the cool cousin this year hahahahahah</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Pascal_Human\"> /u/Pascal_Human </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1gw3k3z/christmas_gift_for_a_cousin/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1gw3k3z/christmas_gi", "id": 1555198, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1gw3k3z/christmas_gift_for_a_cousin", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 471, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Christmas gift for a cousin", "vote": 0}]
