<p>Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) is set to become an official Linux distribution for Microsoft’s Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), a Windows feature that allows users to run Linux environments on Windows without a separate virtual machine. </p>



<p>The move was announced by <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/bringing-red-hat-enterprise-linux-windows-subsystem-linux">Red Hat</a> and <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/whats-new-in-the-windows-subsystem-for-linux-in-november-2024/">Microsoft</a> on November 19. While users already can run any Linux distro via WSL, being an official distro will make it easier for WSL users to discover and install RHEL, according to Microsoft

<p>Generics in Java enhance the type safety of your code and make it easier to read. In my last article, I <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3490016/how-to-use-generics-in-your-java-programs.html">introduced the general concepts of generics and showed examples from the Java Collections Framework</a>. You also learned how to use generics to avoid runtime errors like the <code>ClassCastException</code>.</p>



<p>This article goes into more advanced concepts. I introduce sophisticated type constraints and operations that enhance type safety and flexibility, along with key concepts such as bounded type parameters, which restrict the types used with generics and wildcards and allow method par
