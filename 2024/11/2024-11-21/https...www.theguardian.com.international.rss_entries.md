<p>The return of Trump demands extreme watchfulness. But effective vigilance also requires energy and strength, mental and emotional recharge and balance</p><p>A long walk in the mountains last weekend brought sudden perspective to just how heavily the shoutiness and anger was weighing.</p><p>Suddenly there was only birdsong, the rustling tree canopies, the gentle burbling of the Snowy River and the wind whispering through the trunks of ancient ghost gums. This was anything but a quiet quietness. But it was the sound of a serenity that only nature can gift – a <em>noise</em> of extreme unplugged-ness if you like.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/22/now-is-the-time-to-unplug-and-reset-next-year-we-enter-a-more-dangerous-world-but-for-now-i-need-the-silence-of-nature-ntwnfb">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Three recipes that get their sweetness more from fruit than added sugar: a flaky-crusted apple pie, a buttery bourbon apple slab tart, and a date and pecan pie</p><p>During the holidays, Thanksgiving included, many people crave familiar flavours, not cutting-edge cuisine. The recipes that follow do have a twist – they get most of their sweetness from fruit – but this apparent novelty is arguably rooted in tradition. The idea of looking beyond cane sugar, honey and maple syrup to sweeten desserts may sound newfangled, but, as Michael Pollan explained in his 2002 book The Botany of Desire, fruit is what often satisfied the sweet tooth before the broad accessibility of purer sugars. In addition to fruits in fresh, dried and pureed forms, the pastries below are suffused with unexpected sweetness from miso paste, bourbon, pecans, and spices.</p><p>You can also view these recipes and many more in the new <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/guardian-feast/id6468674686?mt=8">Feast app<

Not exactly a household name even in historically minded households, the 18th-century elector of Saxony and sovereign of Poland is remembered, if&nbsp;at all, as a minor king of bling.</p><p>And it’s true, he was known for living it up. As an impressionable teenager on the Grand Tour, he divided his time between balls, banquets and brothels. Versailles so impressed him that he made it his life’s mission to cosplay as Louis XIV. Accordingly, a&nbsp;cut-price version of the French palace&nbsp;was hastily&nbsp;assembled outside Dresden; these days, Moritzburg Castle is regarded, depending on taste, either as&nbsp;an exemplar of high baroque or a&nbsp;kitschy McMansion.

Soon, Massachusetts began building more arenas and it was on one of these rinks that Dyer first stepped on the ice.</p><p>“I started as a figure skater because at the time that was the only way girls could get on the ice,” Dyer recalls. “But my brother David, who’s two years older, was a hockey player so I would get off the figure skating rink and run over to the hockey rink to watch. I always wanted to play hockey and begged for two years until my father found Assabet in Concord, the next town over.
