## FromSoftware Parent Company Kadokawa Confirms Sony's Buyout Plans - IGN Daily Fix

In today's Daily Fix:
Japanese media giant Kadokawa has confirmed Sony's intent to acquire the company through a buyout. However, no plans have been solidified, as Sony has only submitted a letter of intent, but if an agreement were to be made, a deal could be final in weeks. That would bring Elden Ring and Dark Souls developer FromSoftware under Sony's banner of game developers, along with Kadokawa's formidable anime and manga IP. In other news, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 was released this week, but the launch was riddled with crashes and long queue times. The developers have addressed the issue, blaming it on a data cache that was not ready to handle the full load of wannabe pilots ready to take to the skies. But the devs are assuring fans that a fix is coming, and hopefully it will be enough to reverse the current wave of negative Steam reviews. And finally, the sequel to the 2021 Mortal Kombat live-action reboot movie finally has a rating, and it's 'R.' Makes sense, consider
