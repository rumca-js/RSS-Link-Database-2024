The custom software is stuff I&#39;ve hand for years and runs without issue on all sorts of versions of *unix, including older Pis. They each run a bunch of threads which almost entirely do stuff with sockets and local files (exceptions mentioned below.)</p> <p>Pis have always been one of the more reliable platforms in my opinion, I&#39;ve had some that ran continuously for years with no issues. So when the Pi5 started freezing, I assumed I had a bad board and moved to the other Pi 5. And I posted here about the problem.</p> <p>Then the new Pi 5 started locking up. It was a hard freeze; no mouse response, all networking frozen, power cycle needed. It could take minutes to hours to happen, but eventually it happened, every time.</p", "id": 1561832, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1gwraz2/raspberry_pi_5_has_apparent_quality_control", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 470, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Raspberry Pi 5 has apparent quality control issues ... or not.
