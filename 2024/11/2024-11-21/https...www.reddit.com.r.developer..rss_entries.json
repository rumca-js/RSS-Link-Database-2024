So, I\u2019m a dev without a ton of experience, and to level up, I\u2019m working on a side project. I\u2019m basically trying to recreate the features of an existing paid web platform (that I think is super solid) while adding a few extra features of my own. My plan is to release it for free on Google and also share the code on GitHub as part of building a solid portfolio.</p> <p>But here\u2019s my worry: could this get me into serious legal trouble on a global scale\u2014like copyright or patent issues? I mean, from what I see, everybody seems to copy everybody else, even the big companies like Netflix, Disney+, Prime Video, and so on. So, what do you think?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/beji_matrix2\"> /u/beji_matrix2 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1gw3a70/can_web_project_recreating_features_from_a_paid/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a hr", "id": 1558137, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1gw3a70/can_web_project_recreating_features_from_a_paid", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 508, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Can Web Project Recreating Features from a Paid Platform Get Me in Legal Trouble?", "vote": 0}]
