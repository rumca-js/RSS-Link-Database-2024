<p>Lina Hurtig’s late poke-in ensured Arsenal secured a spot in the Champions League knockout stage with two group games remaining, a 1-0 win over Juventus enough to put them clear at the expense of the Italian club.</p><p>The Gunners needed a win to ensure progression to the quarter-finals after Bayern Munich’s 1-1 draw with Vålerenga in Norway. Instead of the Group C standings being finely poised, Hurtig’s goal gave the Gunners the breathing room they so desperately wanted before they face Bayern at Meadow Park to very likely decide who tops the group.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/21/arsenal-juventus-womens-champions-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Allowing Ukraine to use US Atacms missiles for deep strikes may be worth the risk if it hastens negotiations</p><p>It seems like the war in Ukraine is on the brink of escalating to a new level. North Korean troops have joined Russia on the battlefield, Ukraine is striking deep into Russian territory with US-provided weapons, and the Kremlin is yet again making nuclear threats.

Paradoxically, however, they may also help usher in its end.</p><p>In October, North Korea <a href="https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-russia-ukraine-artillery-f16f8a95fc6b4314c52d4a9271c3632d">added</a> 11,000 troops to the battlefield on Russia’s side.

<p><strong>Watermill theatre, Newbury<br></strong>A<strong> </strong>stupendous cast, outstanding stagecraft and delightful songs prove how thrilling an old story can become in the right hands</p><p>This musical incarnation of the classic story about a talking marionette has been made by many cooks: Michael Morpurgo took Carlo Collodi’s 19th-century original and remoulded it to tell Pinocchio’s story from the boy’s perspective. Simon Reade adapts that iteration for the stage, and Chris Larner adds songs on top. The result is an exemplar of how thrilling an old story can become in the right hands.</p><p>From the first gorgeous scene featuring a luminous cherry tree trunk wrapped around actors to signify the wood from which Pinocchio is forged, this production oozes carnivalesque energy and has an intimacy despite its big imagination. It packs in the drama to become an alchemical mix of music, movement, mischievous humour and quietly revolutionary puppetry.</p> <a href="https://www.the

<p>Pema Tseden’s swan song about the fate of a snow leopard imprisoned by a vengeful farmer gains new layers of political meaning following the director’s death</p><p>Tibetan film-maker Pema Tseden died of heart failure last year at the age of 53, just months after completing this movie; his health was almost certainly weakened by rough treatment from Chinese police in <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/tibetan-filmmaker-pema-tseden-hospitalized-907281/">a notorious 2016 incident at an airport</a> where he was prevented from retrieving his luggage, and the ensuing row escalated when police officers became involved and Tseden ended up in hospital. This ugly and possibly tragic event must surely have influenced Tseden’s final film, which mixes satirical comedy and social commentary and an enigmatic Zen reverie of innocence and experience. The fact that Tseden did die also alters the film’s meaning.</p><p>A TV crew is seen making its way in a four-wheel drive a

<p>From the early beatings, to failing to sign the QB’s key weapons to long-term deals, to botching a defensive rebuild, Cinci have done most things wrong</p><p>You could be forgiven for getting a sense of deja vu watching the Cincinnati Bengals and Los Angeles Chargers last Sunday. For the second week in a row, Joe Burrow torched a defense. He hit one eye-popping throw after another. In the final accounting, he threw for 356 yards, three touchdowns and did not turn over the ball. And yet the result was the same: the Bengals lost by one score.</p><p>What Burrow is doing this season is unprecedented. Never has a quarterback played at such a high level, with such a heavy workload, while being let down by almost everyone around him. Only Tony Romo in 2010 and Aaron Rodgers in 2018 have <a href="https://www.pff.com/news/nfl-bengals-qb-joe-burrow-cincinnati-bengals-losing-record">come close</a>, but even that duo had the benefit of solid protection from their linemen.

<p>Whoever takes over the hot seat will find the foundations are strong – this is a thing that doesn’t need messing with</p><p>When I was young, and random old people my parents knew would ask what I wanted to do with my life, I’d always answer: “Be Des Lynam,” – at the time mainly to end the conversation so I could go back upstairs and play Sensible Soccer. But it seemed like a fun thing to do.</p><p>So it was with some excitement a couple of weeks ago that I received a screengrab of the odds for the next host of Match of the Day. I was sixth favourite at 12-1! Gratifying stuff – it was now simply a case of somehow disposing of Dan Walker, Colin Murray, Jeff Stelling, Manish and Chappers and the chair was mine. I guess people might have got suspicious after the first couple disappeared.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/21/the-next-host-of-match-of-the-day-some-thoughts-from-the-2015-sixth-favourite">Continue reading...</a>

<p>County Clare’s dramatic shoreline is the backdrop to Loop Head Lighthouse and its two holiday cottages. Binoculars for sea viewing included – but not wifi</p><p>We cross a narrow strip of land under vast skies and follow a slim road. It cuts a straight line through the heart of County Clare’s only peninsula – a jagged spearhead-shaped piece of land that dangles downward, like a tail, right into the Atlantic. The landscape tapers as the mouth of the River Shannon appears to the south, and the ocean to the north, until we reach the tip of the spear at what seems to be the very edge of the world; and there it stands, defiant and elevated on an outcrop – Loop Head Lighthouse.</p><p>From some point in childhood, my introverted self romanticised the role of a lightkeeper.

After what must surely have been one of the oddest opening remarks to the Royal Society in its storied 200-plus-year history – “I shall largely speak of mice,” Calhoun began, “but my thoughts are on man, on healing, on life and its evolution” – he spoke of a long-term experiment he was running on the effects of overcrowding and population crashes in mice.</p><p>Members of the Royal Society were scratching their heads as Calhoun told them of U

He’s a Don Draper sort: works in advertising, at the top of his game, fond of walking along while throwing out pearls of wisdom and instructions to his team. “I want at least 17 seconds on the cheese pull,” he insists to a minion working on a pizza commercial.

It’s clear, however, that pride goeth before a fall.</p><p>The fall in question here is a sudden cancer diagnosis, out of nowhere. Arjun is given 100 or so days to live.
