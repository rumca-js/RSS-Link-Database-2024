<p>Mike Masnick, writing for MSNBC:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Turns out for the “Twitter Files” crew, “creeping
authoritarianism” isn’t so creepy when it’s your team doing the
creeping.</p>

<p>Before, we were told that White House officials’ merely reaching
out to social media companies about election misinformation was a
democracy-ending threat. Now, the world’s richest man has openly
used his platform to boost one candidate, ridden that campaign’s
success into the White House himself, and ... crickets. The
silence is deafening.</p>

<p>There isn’t even a suggestion that Musk should have to divest from
his ownership of X. No one expects that. There is no discussion of
how Musk set up <a href="https://x.com/DOGE">an entire account</a> on his own platform for
his own “Department of Government Efficiency” and gave it a “gray”

  <p>We constrain our imaginations when we subordinate our creations to
names owned by fascist tycoons. Imagine the author of a book
telling people to “read my Amazon”. A great director trying to
promote their film by saying “click on my Max”. That’s how much
they’ve pickled your brain when you refer to your own work and
your own voice within the context of their walled garden. There is
no such thing as “my Substack”, there is only your writing, and a
forever fight against the world of pure enshittification.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am upset by the above, but only insofar as I’m jealous that I had never thought to make the analogy to an author telling people to “read my Amazon”. A publication on Substack is no more “a Substack” than a blog on WordPress is “a WordPress”. It’s really quite a nifty — but devious — trick that Substack has pulled to make t
