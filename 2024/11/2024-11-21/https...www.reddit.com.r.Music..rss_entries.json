Unfortunately I never got to meet my uncle because he passed away from a heart attack before I was born. This song played on the radio one day while me and my mom were driving home and she told me that this song was played at my uncle\u2019s funeral, I never knew that. In that moment I felt sympathy for my father because I knew he loved his brother very much, and then a tear fell from my eye.
