Bonus points if the author has consecutive good books already under their belt so I can binge them.</p> <p>Length doesn&#39;t matter as long as the quality itself is good. Genre doesn&#39;t matter, either.

He literally has never picked up a book in his life besides the couple chapters of The Secret History that he read to me once (that he was totally into). Everything I read is either too long for him to ever pick up or not his speed (the midnight library, demon copperhead, normal people, etc.). I think he’d like something fantasy-ish, but idk. Hes not at all into Star Wars or anything like that but he loves Harry Potter and avatar the last airbender. </p> <p>Any recommendations? It has to be so good and not start out slow lol.

Seeing a once great nation fall and then get back up excites me iyk.</p> <p>So if you have any suggestions please please give them to me! Length and such is of no problem. Also it <em>doesn&#39;t</em> have to be fantasy (a historical epic would work as well I&#39;d say).

Maybe a thriller, but open to all kinds of fiction. </p> <p>I know I said fiction but a book I just finished reading was <em>The Wisdom of Morrie</em>, which I read after reading <em>Tuesdays with Morrie</em>. Loved those, genuinely feel like I improved as a person after reading those and that got me out of my reading slump (which Wheel of Time got me into). </p> <p>Another book I liked was <em>Then She Was Gone</em>, the thriller aspect of that kept me on my toes and I loved every part of it. </p> <p>Finally, the last book I’ll mention is <em>Blade’s Edge</em>, of which I acquired at Comic Con one year. Liked it, I loved the Japanese inspired lore but it was a bit too YA for me I guess? I think I gave it a 3/5 whereas <

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I finished listening to the Horus Heresy, roughly 62 audiobooks so prefacing I&#39;m done with Warhammer for a bit after listening at work for the last 2-ish years.</p> <p>What I liked most about Horus Heresy was not the Space Marines but the common person having to deal with Space Marines was much more interesting and entertaining. Another thing I liked about Horus Heresy was the occasional alternate perspective where you recognize something from someone else&#39;s perspective. In example, a prominent character moving through a crowd and turning a corner. A few chapters or even a book later someone else sees this person but the author doesn&#39;t say who because if the reader was paying any attention they should know.</p> <p>Of Horus Heresy my favorite book was Fulgrim. A decent into madness from pristine victorian like character. People who were of high standard becoming brutal murderers because of a dark energy. Of characters my favorite was Ignac
