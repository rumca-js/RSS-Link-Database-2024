Among the resurgence of side-scrolling beat ‘em ups, G.I. Joe: Wrath of Cobra sits somewhere near the back of the pack in quality. Still, this valiant attempt should be recognized, especially for its success capturing the identity of the G.I. Joe brand well. 

All the traditional trademarks of the genre are here. Levels progress from left to right as you stomp your way through waves of enemy Cobra soldiers and pick up guns and health packs along the way. 

Couch co-op or online play is probably going to supply more fun than solo runs, but either way, Wrath of Cobra offers a decent romp. The lacking boss fights and poor variety hold this back from earning a permanent spot in the arcade section of my PS5 library. Still, the basic enjoyment of the simplistic gameplay and the charming audio/visuals should be worth your time if you’re a fan of the genre or IP.

Grand Theft Auto 6 is finally arriving within the Fall months of 2025 and anticipation is at a fever pitch. We all know how well it’s going to sell and perform, but can it possibly live up to the standards set by Red Dead Redemption 2? 

Red Dead Redemption 2 sold remarkably well in its own right, becoming the second fastest selling game just behind GTA 5. Aspects such as realism, attention to detail, and story remain unsurpassed in many gamers’ minds regarding RDR 2. 

But GTA 6 may have what it takes to dethrone it based on its franchise pedigree and concept. GTA is a more arcade like experience than RDR 2, allowing for a highly flexible and newbie-friendly playstyle.

Time will tell if GTA 6 can match RDR 2’s tremendous story, but it’s certainly within the realm of possibility based on the reveal trailer.

The S.T.A.L.K.E.R. and Fallout franchises are both no strangers to wowing players with expansive and immersive wasteland experiences, and though both tend to go about that in pretty different ways, they do also share a lot of the same DNA. 

S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl recently released, reviving GSC Game World’s beloved horror shooter series after a long hiatus, and though it has more than its fair share of rough edges, it’s also an easy recommendation to anyone starved for more Fallout and desperately looking for alternatives. 

Bethesda’s series is MIA for now, and will remain so for who knows how long, but S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 delivers a compelling post-apocalyptic emergent sandbox of its own, and we cannot recommend it enough if you’re looking for a Fallout-esque experience that holds nothing back in its attempt to bring its harsh world to life.
