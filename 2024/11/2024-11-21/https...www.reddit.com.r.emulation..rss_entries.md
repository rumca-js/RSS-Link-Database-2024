<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>After so long, we have finally released a new version of melonDS: 1.0 RC.</p> <p>It is a release candidate because there have been many changes since the last version, so this release will be the occasion to find and deal with any bugs that crop up before a proper, clean 1.0 release.</p> <p>Among the new features: improved local multiplayer, LAN support, multi-window support, OpenGL compute renderer allowing for more accurate graphics AND upscaling, and several others.</p> <p>You can find more information in the release post: <a href="https://melonds.kuribo64.net/comments.php?id=216">https://melonds.kuribo64.net/comments.php?id=216</a></p> <p>You can download the release here: <a href="https://melonds.kuribo64.net/downloads.php">https://melonds.kuribo64.net/downloads.php</a></p> <p>Enjoy!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Arisotura"> /u/Arisotura </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/e

Since last time there are two major changes to note:</p> <ol> <li>Fullscreen mode! Now Retrom is easily used in couch gaming environments and feels great on handhelds! <ol> <li>Initial gamepad support should properly render glyphs for just about any XBox controllers and/or DualShock controllers. There are bound to be some missing pieces here, so please reach out to report faulty/missing controller mappings on <a href="https://github.com/JMBeresford/retrom">github</a> or <a href="https://disco
