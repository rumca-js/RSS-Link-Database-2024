<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey all,</p> <p>So I am a recovering alcoholic. I ruined my finances and almost lost my family before I got sober. My wife is an absolute angel and has stuck by my side. I want to give her something special for Christmas but all of my money is going into catching up my debts. I&#39;d like to bounce this idea off you guys and see if you have any suggestions to make it happen. </p> <p>In my recovery I picked up poetry and I&#39;m decently good at it. But my handwriting is ass. So I thought about writing her something, printing a stamp of it in TPU in some sort of elegant script, and stamping it on some fancy paper. Then I&#39;d like to frame it. Also in the frame I&#39;d like to do a lithopane photo of us. Perhaps some led strip in the frame but I&#39;m on the fence about that. </p> <p>Has anyone done anything similar? Will the TPU stamp be effective? Would it be better to custom make the frame or should I modify a store-bought one? I&#39;ve never done
