<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I know it’s a weird request, but I love fantasy where there’s a quest, and a lot of time is spent travelling. Campfire conversations and discussions at taverns and inns, are often my favourite parts of books.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>A classic trope for fantasy stories, be they dark or heroic, is the city under siege. Whether they be besieged by evil creatures and armies or by morally ambiguous forces, it’s a compelling concept. How will our heroes prevail against incredible odds? Who will die and who will survive?</p> <p>It’s one of my favorite kinds of stories. So my friends I ask you, for the sake of fun discussion, what are your favorite siege stories in fantasy?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/EMB1981"> /u/EMB1981 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1gwr7kl/what_are_your_favorite_siege_stories/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1gwr7kl/what_are_your_favorite_siege_stories/">[comments]</a></span>

Just the world and the characters were so engaging and it felt like I was truly a part of it. I was wondering if anybody can suggest series/standalones that give the same vibes as BG3. I don&#39;t necessarily mean the same world setting as Forgotten Realms (although I wouldn&#39;t mind that as well) but something that gives me similar feelings. Another game that sort of made me feel this way was Skyrim. So books similar to that also are appreciated.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi there,</p> <p>as it is pretty obvious from the title, i am one of the lucky ones who is/was invested in a number of book series that are waiting for the sequels since a looooong a** time.</p> <p>I stopped reading for some time, then started again with almost all Drizzt novel, the Poppy Wars books, then moved to the Book of the Ancestor Trilogy and i am currently finishing the last book of the Book of the Ice trilogy.</p> <p>I am looking for another good read to cover some time until (hopefully) the road to Emberlain trilogy arrives.</p> <p>Are there any suggestion for either single books or trilogies. I am not prepared to start a full-blown series with 10+ books as of now. Are Lawrences&#39; other series worthy of diving into them?</p> <p>Thanks</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/chamois_de"> /u/chamois_de </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1gw9vjz/recommendations

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone,</p> <p>I could really use some help finding new fantasy books that I’ll love. Despite being 30, I feel like I mostly enjoy books targeted toward young adults, and my reading preferences reflect that. Here’s some context to guide your recommendations:</p> <ul> <li><p>My all-time favorite fantasy series is Eragon by Christopher Paolini. For years, I struggled to find anything that gripped me in the same way.</p></li> <li><p>Recently, I discovered The Kingkiller Chronicle by Patrick Rothfuss, and it was the first time since Eragon that I couldn’t wait to get home every day to read.</p></li> </ul> <p>I think the common threads I love in these books are: A well-crafted magic system. An immersive fantasy world. A protagonist who starts from nothing and grows into greatness.</p> <p>-That said, not everything works for me:</p> <p>I tried The Farseer Trilogy by Robin Hobb (Assassin’s Apprentice), but I found it too slow and honestly a bit boring.

## Better as an audiobook

Partially because I struggle with most Sci-Fi series and also found it difficult relating to the characters. But I kept hearing about how great the it is.

## Questions about The Dresden Files: does Murphy ever get less annoying? Does Harry ever get less horny?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I read the first Dresden Files book and thought it was solid. I mostly just enjoyed the different ways magic was presented, but the actual plot was pretty fun as well. However, Murphy annoyed the shit out of me throughout the book, and continued to do so in the second book to the point that I stopped reading. Like, holy shit. She hires a wizard to help her handle magic shit because she knows nothing about it, but tries to fucking throw him in prison any time he does something without telling her. Does she ever realize that the literal goddamn wizard that she chose to consult might know what he&#39;s talking about? </p> <p>Another thing that irked me about the books, though much less so, was how Harry interacts with women. I get that he&#39;s old fashioned, that he likes women, etc. etc. but it just gets old after awhile. Does that get better as the series goes on? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user

## How do you feel about series that include a prequel between books?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I read the Silo trilogy and the second book is a prequel. I enjoyed the prequel overall but I had a hard time starting it and had to leaf through a few parts I think because in my head I was like &quot;yeah I know where this is going&quot;. I wonder if that is because of how it was written or by virtue of it delaying the story I had gotten invested in.</p> <p>Are there any other series that have done this? Was it done well or did you have the same feeling of impatience I felt?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SweetGreyBaby"> /u/SweetGreyBaby </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1gw5x3l/how_do_you_feel_about_series_that_include_a/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1gw5x3l/how_do_you_feel_about_series_that_include_a/">[comments]</a></span>

Red Sonja herself is one of the most successful spin off characters in modern fiction as a creation of Roy Thomas, based on Sonya of Rogatino in “The Shadow of the Vulture.” Even if you’re not familiar with the character, you’re probably familiar with the chain mail bikini clad barbarian archetype that burned itself into the brains of many a teenage boy (as well as girl). Impractical an outfit as it may be, she has had hundreds of adventures and fascinating stories in the Sword and Sorcery genre and is only really rivaled by Conan himself.</p> <p>Gail Simone’s run was mildly controversial because she re-imagined the character in several ways from the classic Thomas incarnation.

Anyway I’m looking for some recs that would match the qualities I loved so much in TPWs. </p> <p>The main aspects of the series I loved: - strong, well written female mc + her spiral into madness - characters overall being fleshed out to feel real - relatively simple power system that leans into nature/elements - the military jargon (I actually bought a copy of Sunzi after reading the first book) - overall a complicated conflict with ambiguous morality (not a black and white war) - devastating (I love a sad ending)</p> <p>I already have read She Who Became The Sun and have The Sword of Kaigen on my tbr but if there are some other, lesser known recs out there, please!!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/prettypiscezzz"> /u/prettypiscezzz </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.red
