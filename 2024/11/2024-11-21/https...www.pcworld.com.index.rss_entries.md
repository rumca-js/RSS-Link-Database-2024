<p>You don’t need incredible, teeth-rattling power for a desktop, even a gaming desktop. But you do need something better than the crappy little five-watt nothings that are included in your monitor.</p>



<p>Right now, Amazon has the bookshelf speakers that I personally use in my own setup on sale. I’m talking about the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Edifier-R1280T-Powered-Bookshelf-Speakers/dp/B016P9HJIA/">Edifier R1280T speakers for just $84</a>, which is 30 percent off its $120 retail price.</p>



<p>These speakers have been a staple of PC power users for years, and you’ll see them all over communities like Reddit’s /r/battlestations. They sound great, with crystal-clear mids and a bit of bass power without needing a separate subwoofer. With 42 watts, four-inch primary drivers, and 13mm tweeters, it’s powerful enough to fill an office easily without br

<p>Oh boy. We’re just over a week away from Black Friday and the OLED monitor deals are starting to pop out of the ground. We’ve seen multiple stores offering 27-inch gaming OLEDs for <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2527078/act-now-to-get-this-msi-1440p-240hz-oled-monitor-at-its-cheapest-price.html">as little as $500</a>, but if you want something bigger, Best Buy has <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/lg-ultragear-45-oled-curved-wqhd-240hz-0-03ms-freesync-and-nvidia-g-sync-compatible-gaming-monitor-with-hdr400-black/6575395.p?skuId=6575395">this 45-inch LG ultrawide OLED monitor for $1,000</a>. That’s an amazing $700 off its original price.</p>



<p>The LG UltraGear 45GS96QB is a unique design. Other ultrawide monitors in this size range tend to go with doubled-up resolutions, but this one has the semi-standard 3440×1440, so it’s basically stre

<p>As an afficionado of all things mechanical keyboard, I’ve seen a few wild designs in my time. But I’ve never seen a commercial keyboard brand make something quite so unique or charming as this.</p>



<p>Epomaker’s newest design is a full split ergonomic keyboard that’s all wireless and all wood. It’s also expensive — the complete set with a wireless numpad and wrist rests will cost $549.</p>



<p>But dang it if that might actually be justified in this case. The <a href="https://epomaker.com/products/epomaker-x-feker-alice-60-wood">Epomaker x Feker Alice 60 Wood</a> keyboard’s body and keycaps are all made of 100 percent real dead tree.

<p>There are several ways to transfer files from your smartphone to your PC. You can do it via USB cable, stick, Bluetooth, or Android apps. Microsoft’s Edge, Windows’ main browser, is also capable of such an exchange. Whether you’re looking to store your photos or music on your PC or vice versa, we’ll show you how to do it with Edge.</p>

<p>Windows 11 24H2 has already caused so many issues since it first started rolling out in October, and there doesn’t seem to be an end in sight. Microsoft is scrambling to address concerns left and right, and here’s another one to add to the ever-growing list.</p>



<p>After updating to Windows 11 24H2, some users who don’t have administrative privileges are reporting that the Date & Time section of Windows Settings can’t change the time zone anymore. “The expected time zone option is not visible to non-administrator users,” says Microsoft on the relevant <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/status-windows-11-24h2#november-2024">support page</a>, aware of the issue.</p>



<p>To be absolutely clear, this is a problem that’s isolated to Windows Settings and its Date & Time section. The problem doesn’t stem from any changes made

<p>Microsoft wants to be done with Windows 10 and have everyone move to Windows 11. It’s given the nine-year-old operating system <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1801718/windows-10-wont-receive-any-more-feature-updates.html">an official expiration date next year</a>, and it’s not shy about leaving those users behind. But its latest attempt to spur them on is its most brazen yet: full-page ads telling you to just go buy a Copilot+ laptop.</p>



<p>This isn’t Microsoft’s first alert to users that Windows 10 is being retired, and it’s not even the first time it has <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2229814/windows-10-nags-users-with-full-screen-multipage-windows-11-ads.html">resorted to full-screen alerts</a> to drive the message home.

<p>Starting November 12, Windows 10 users have been running into problems when trying to update or uninstall apps. Normally, your first thought would be that such an issue is due to a Windows update… but that’s not the case here!</p>



<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/status-windows-10-22h2#3447msgdesc">Microsoft officially confirmed the problem</a> and explained that it’s rooted in an update to the WinAppSDK 1.6.2 package, which was published on November 12. As such, this problem — the inability to update or uninstall — only affects apps that are dependent on WinAppSDK. Unfortunately, a lot of apps are.</p>



<p>When you try to update an affected app through the Microsoft Store, you’ll see the “Something happened on our end” error message. Currently, this issue affects Microsoft Teams and other third-party ap

<p>Apple’s latest MacBook Air is getting the Black Friday treatment, dropping to a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-2024-MacBook-13-inch-Laptop/dp/B0DLHY19N3/">new best price of $849 on Amazon</a>, a rare 23 percent off its original $1,099 price. That’s an absolutely lit discount for a laptop that’s only been out for about eight months, and doubly so because Apple tends to be stingy with its sales.</p>



<p>This 13.6-inch laptop features Apple’s speedy M3 chip, which is phenomenal for multitasking, streaming content, and even casual gaming. The 16GB of RAM ensures you have a smooth experience no matter what you’re doing. This is a productivity powerhouse.</p>



<p>But if there’s one thing that truly sets MacBooks apart from their counterparts, it’s their gorgeous displays equipped with Liquid Retina technology. The latest MacBook Air is no different,

<p>The Trump administration will arrive in Washington this coming January with an enormous question mark over its head: Will Trump deliver on his promise to impose tariffs of up to 60 percent, and how will that affect the technology products that Americans buy?</p>



<p>The short answer? No one really knows. For now, however, we have to take Trump’s words at face value, even if Trump eventually changes his mind. And if we do <em>that</em>, we can point you to where you’ll be paying more.</p>



<p>Specifically, Trump’s statements indicate that two tariffs would be imposed: a flat tariff of about 10 percent on all imports, plus an additional 60 percent tariff on goods imported from China. The Consumer Technology Association has estimated that, based on current levels and patterns of trade, the effective tariff on Chinese goods will go up as high as 80.6 perc

<p>Portable apps are applications and tools that can be started directly and without prior installation. </p>



<p>The advantage of this is that the programs are immediately ready for use and can be started from an internal or external hard drive or a USB stick. Useful tools are then also available for analyzing and maintaining a second or third-party computer, for example.</p>
