I pulled the scenario specific herbs discovery token and realized that it seems completely different from the normal herbs discovery token (+1 heart vs +1 morale with the pot). Just want to confirm that this scenario specific token does indeed heal one wound, or should it be treated like the normal herbs token? And if it does heal, can it be distributed to any player? Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/espressionado\"> /u/espressionado </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://i.redd.it/0v3uy2lcn52", "id": 1555257, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1gw3wwm/robinson_crusoe_castaways", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 473, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://preview.redd.it/0v3uy2lcn52e1.jpeg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=f24a8149c8cd14651530b4c2253f2c46d7f1939a", "title": "Robinson Crusoe - Castaways", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "author": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-11-21T00:49:10+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Just curious, anyone in Singapore looking for a group to meet regularly over the weekend (Saturdays) and okay to travel to North (Yishun)?</p> <p>We&#39;ve got a small group, mostly play medium to heavy games.
