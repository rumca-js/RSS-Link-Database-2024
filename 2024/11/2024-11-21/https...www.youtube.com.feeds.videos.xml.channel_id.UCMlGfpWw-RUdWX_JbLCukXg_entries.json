This presentation will share the insights we've gained during its development. Our approach to easy configuration is a double-edged sword, providing user-friendly setup while occasionally leading to lower recall. We maintain a strict definition of false positives, ensuring the tool does not warn about well-written, functional code. This principle, while challenging, drives us to fix rather than suppress false positives. A core philosophy of Cppcheck is to learn from mistakes. When an issue is identified, we strive to implement checkers to prevent similar mistakes in the future.\n\nThe open-source community plays a crucial role in Cppcheck's evolution. We collaborate to enhance the tool, scanning large codebases like Debian's source code to identify i", "id": 1559518, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztyhiMhvrqA", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 420, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCMlGfpWw-RUdWX_JbLCukXg", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/ztyhiMhvrqA/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Building Cppcheck - What We Learned from 17 Years of Development - Daniel Marjam\u00e4ki - CppCon 2024", "vote": 0}]
