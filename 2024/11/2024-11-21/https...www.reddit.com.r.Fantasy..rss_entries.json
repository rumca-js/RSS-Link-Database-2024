An immersive fantasy world.

I mostly just enjoyed the different ways magic was presented, but the actual plot was pretty fun as well. However, Murphy annoyed the shit out of me throughout the book, and continued to do so in the second book to the point that I stopped reading. Like, holy shit. She hires a wizard to help her handle magic shit because she knows nothing about it, but tries to fucking throw him in prison any time he does something without telling her. Does she ever realize that the literal goddamn wizard that she chose to consult might know what he&#39;s talking about? </p> <p>Another thing that irked me about the books, though much less so, was how Harry interacts with women.
