And perhaps most remarkably of all, they now sit outright second in Group C of Asian qualifying with their hopes of reaching the 2026 World Cup in their own hands.</p><p>It all appeared to be going straightforwardly. Holding onto a 1-0 lead delivered just 38 seconds into the game when Kusini Yengi pounced on a disastrous attempted backpass by Sayed Baqer, the Socceroos weren’t fully comfortable as the game wore on but they at least looked well-p

<p>When is a bargain not a bargain? And how do you avoid overspending? Here’s how to make Black Friday work for you</p><p>Black Friday didn’t exist when I was a kid. In the 80s, the fourth Friday in November was just another chalk mark on the run-up to Christmas. But Black Friday, which falls on 29 November this year, is now an autumn staple. We spend billions in an attempt to … save money. Therein lies the irony of sales. The spectacle of people fighting over stuff they wouldn’t normally want is why retailers love Black Friday even more than customers do. To win this game, you must know what you want, and whether it’s a real bargain. That means doing your research now.</p><p>Here are some practical tips and psychological tricks to find the best price for any product, be first in the queue for bargains, check whether a discount is legit – and stop yourself going rogue.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2024/nov/19/black-friday-deals-tips-cyber-monday">Continue readin

<p>Harold Brown, 80, given £200 penalty after Hampshire neighbours complained of crowing he said was a ‘croak’</p><p>A man has been fined after his noisy pet cockerel subjected neighbours in a quiet street to “torture” by repeatedly crowing as early as 3am.<br><br>
 Harold Brown, 80, was hauled into court over the “nuisance” bird, which was recorded crowing once a minute for an hour and a half by environmental health officials after residents complained of the continual “cock-a-doodle-do” sound.<br><br>
 Brown claimed in court that the noise was more of a “croak” than a traditional cockerel’s crow, but six of his neighbours in the residential cul-de-sac on the edge of Hampshire’s New Forest complained.<br><br>
 They told Southampton magistrates court they had had to avoid parts of their house to get away from the “discernible” and “significant” squawking which would occur almost every morning.<br><br>

<p>The makers of Making Manson have found a wealth of new audio footage that adds texture to an infamous figure without absolving him of his terrible crimes</p><p>When it comes to Charles Manson, the image we most know and fear – and arguably fixate on – is that of grungy cult leader. It’s complete with the loose hippie shirts that flow like robes and that thick unkept beard covering so much of his face and becoming integral to his messianic antichrist aesthetic.</p><p>“But he never had a beard,” says Making Manson director Billie Mintz, pulling on a loose thread. He’s referring to the period when the man charged with orchestrating several grisly murders – among the victims Hollywood actress, Sharon Tate – was leading his young and impressionable commune who came to be known as the Manson Family. At that time, and contrary to the popular image we’ve come to know through mugshots and courtroom footage, Manson was completely clean-shaven. In Mintz’s three-part docuseries, we hear Manso

There are, of course, plenty of other storylines for the Lakers already this year: for starters, the rumblings that they haven’t done enough to provide a competent supporting cast around superstars Anthony Davis and LeBron James, the former of whom is having an MVP-caliber start to the season. Then there are the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/22/lebron-bronny-james-los-angeles-lakers-father-son-nba">cries of nepotism</a> at the signing of James’ son, Bronny.

He is stunned to discover a manuscript containing four cryptic lines of poetry, not in Latin or Italian, but, his companion tells him, “written in <em>English”</em>. “<em>English</em>?” Langdon gasps, disbelievingly (the breathy italics, just two of hundreds of examples in the novel, are both Brown’s). Not only are the lines in <em>English </em>(<em>English? English!</em>), but their author, despite belonging to a clandestine group, has obligingly put his name to them: “The poem is signed John Milton.” Even as Langdon’s mind boggles,

<p>Gibson is one of a recognisable adult cast slumming it in this toothless 80s-style tale of kids duking it out with evil menaces</p><p>This horror-mystery about a plucky bunch of young adolescents squaring off against supernatural forces unknown is clearly looking to capitalise on the 80s/90s nostalgia that has made Stranger Things such a palpable hit. The kids ride around on bikes, they play baseball, they convene in a treehouse with a sign that says “KEEP OUT”, and they investigate creepy loners who live by themselves. It takes place in 1997, and details like no one having a mobile phone are accurate as well as useful for the plot.</p><p>The representation of the kids themselves is carefully sanitised: no one is smoking cigarettes or dropping sexist, racist or homophobic slang. It’s less of a throwback to the era itself and more like a film that references previous and existing throwbacks. But where Twin Peaks knowingly subverted a vision of smalltown America, there’s no such ori

<p>Doctors are pushing the limits of science and human biology to save more extremely premature babies than ever before. But when so few survive, are we putting them through needless suffering? </p><p>Alice Smith was five months pregnant when she noticed some discharge one evening, and something felt off. She did an online yoga class and went to bed early, but the next day she felt worried enough to phone the maternity triage line. The midwives invited her in for a checkup at Homerton hospital, near her home in east London. Smith emailed her boss to explain she’d be offline for a few hours and then headed to hospital.</p><p>Until then, her pregnancy had progressed smoothly. She was 37 years old, healthy and expecting twins: a boy and a girl. A routine ultrasound a few weeks earlier had suggested all was well. Smith and her husband, Jim Clack, had already decided to name their daughter Peggy. For their son they had drawn up a shortlist of names.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.co
