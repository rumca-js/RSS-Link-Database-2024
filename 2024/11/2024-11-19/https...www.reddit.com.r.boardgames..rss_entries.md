<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have a friend who owns a copy of Moonrakers, and I have played it twice with him. My impressions are that the game seems EXTREMELY punishing for anyone who is not able to get access to early game reactor and thruster cards. Like to the point that it is an unplayable experience and you just sit in base and lose. If you don&#39;t have a hand with both reactors and thrusters you can only play a literal single card on a mission, making you extremely weak. Without a reliable way to guarantee a chain every turn, the entire game just feels like a total crapshoot to me. Will you get lucky and have an item you can afford that gives a reactor? I hope so, or else you don&#39;t get to play.</p> <p>For context, I have only played the game with an expansion that adds in these dual reactor/thruster cards. Maybe the base game is better balanced, but it seems like players just have a ridiculously hard time getting off the ground. </p> <p>I have looked around online

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I missed the thread from yesterday! </p> <p>I always appreciate when people do a con report and give a shotgun blast of quick reviews, so I thought I would return the favor. This past week I went to my sixth BGGCon. My group shrank to three people due to some last minute cancellations, but we got some plays in: </p> <p><em>S Tier</em> * <strong>Lords of Vegas</strong> - I feel a little cheap putting this on this list since its probably my favorite game that I&#39;d don&#39;t own, but hot damn this is a good one. We picked up the ridiculous briefcase version from the library and I was able to end the game early by going out at 60 points - the only time I&#39;ve ever seen this! This game never forgets that its about gambling - if you&#39;re not sprawling, gambling in other casinos or doing hostel takeovers, you&#39;re not going to win. I love how much the gameplay happens above the table. So many deals trying to get made. Just a perfect game. </p> <ul>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I mean, nobody asked, but I&#39;ve been mulling it over, mostly due to thinking about the systems in Arcs, and also thinking about my own personal most-hated of games. There are a few games that are fairly universally disliked here, and... generally, I&#39;m not going to argue tha any of these are good games. But it&#39;s interesting to think about the ways they do and/or don&#39;t succeed at what they&#39;re doing.</p> <p>Sid Meyer, semi-famously, describes a game as &#39;a series of interesting decisions&#39;, and I think he&#39;s pretty much spot-on. Each of the games that fails here ultimately fails because it doesn&#39;t pass that core test. But the other things that some of the most broadly disliked games do is... worth of analysis, if only because of what they can teach us about how important those things can be to a game, beyond the metrics of their gameplay loop.</p> <p><strong>Monopoly:</strong></p> <p>Let&#39;s start with the most obvious

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey!</p> <p>My girlfriend is spending a few days in hospital and cannot move much. So I was thinking about little games to bring for us to play on her side table (it&#39;s quite spacious, but not big). I have Hero Realms as a card game but I was wondering if you guys have any other ideas?</p> <p>It doesn&#39;t have to be a &quot;quick and easy&quot; game, our favourite game is &quot;War of the Ring&quot; so epic and strategy are fine as long as it doesn&#39;t take up a lot of space. Hidden movement would also be great but please don&#39;t limit suggestions to those ideas!</p> <p>Only thing we don&#39;t like are abstract games like Azul (I know, I&#39;m sorry). </p> <p>But yeah any ideas will be appreciated!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Albriss"> /u/Albriss </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1guk1r8/games_for_hospital/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I personally love the gameplay and the options it provides (even though it can be a bit fiddly at times) but for me there’s two things that bother me pretty much every time I play it: the two new wonders that give you a bonus right off the bat and the fact that the science cards are much less interesting than before. Literally every time the new wonders come up when I play online, they are always automatic first picks, solely because of their starting bonus. And science is only drafted very, very rarely because the other win cons give much better bonuses along the way. I think both can be easily remedied as well, which almost makes it even more frustrating. Just modify the wonders slightly so that their starting bonus is removed and their activation ability is strengthened slightly and adapt the way the science tokens to make them work like they do in lord of the rings duel. Everything else is really good I think and for me easily matches Pantheon in
