<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>hi all,</p> <p>ive found one of my old hard drives from around 2012. back then i was a miner and played the crypto game. mined mostly doge and some light and worldcoin and so ... ive already sold most of it around 2015 when i was broke. but i know ive kept some doge on one of my drives in a local wallet. </p> <p>i think ive found that drive, entirely sure but atleast i hope. the drive is not encrypted. i dont know which wallet app i used back then.</p> <p>what is the best way to locate the wallet between thousands of folderS from various projects and backups and so ? is there like a file type i could look for? i think the wallet is encrypted is it possible to search for all encrypted files, or does anyone have a good idea?</p> <p>After i found it i will need to decrypt it. xD</p> <p>thxxx</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Love-Tech-1988"> /u/Love-Tech-1988 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.redd

When miracast is pin protected does anyone know if this is simply a wps pin that can be reavered? If anyone has looked into miracast hijacking/hacking I would love to know what you have found.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/DashByManyNames"> /u/DashByManyNames </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1gv0z0e/miracastmicrosoft_wireless_da/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1gv0z0e/miracastmicrosoft_wireless_da/">[comments]</a></span>
