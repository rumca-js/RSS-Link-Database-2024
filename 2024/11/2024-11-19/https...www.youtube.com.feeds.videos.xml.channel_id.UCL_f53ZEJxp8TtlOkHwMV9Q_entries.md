Today is the official release date of my new book, "We Who Wrestle with God". In it, I explore the ancient, foundational stories of the Western world. I analyze the Biblical accounts of rebellion, sacrifice, suffering, and redemption that have long stabilized, inspired, and united us—both psychologically and culturally.

“When the wrong principle is established as supreme—when a false king is set upon the throne or an impious ethos prevails—the people quickly find themselves deprived of the water of life…a kingdom oriented around the wrong pole—that worships the wrong gods, so to speak—suffers psychologically or spiritually.”
