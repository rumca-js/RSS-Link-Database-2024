<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Wanted to get this off my chest ever since the release of RDR1 to pc. I loved Red Dead Redemption One as a child and it still is one of my favorite games of all time, but I was completely heartbroken they disabled the multiplayer of the game for no apparent reason besides saving money and fueling their garbage monetization for 2 and Gta 5 multiplayer. </p> <p>This game does not deserve the 50 dollar price tag whatsoever and especially when one of my favorite multiplayer experiences in a game was carelessly removed for the online monetizations goblins working at Rockstar. RDO1 Multiplayer was the only time Rockstar did Multiplayer right and they killed it. Shame on them, and please don&#39;t support half assed remasters that cut massive features to penny pinch their Bobby Goblin Kotick mentalities. Fuck RDR1 PC port, it doesn&#39;t deserve a dime from anyone.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Alarak

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Good afternoon, after the world is all becoming subscription-based I&#39;m hating it and I&#39;ve returned to piracy :) Specifically music, I want to avoid any music service because they all come with subscriptions, and I read the wiki and the subreddit, I saw you use soulseek and it&#39;s popular.</p> <p>I downloaded it and started using it, but I found it a bit weird? The logic to download music isn&#39;t as straightforward as for example making a google search, because soulseek is peer-to-peer and even if I search &quot;indie&quot; as an example, what I get is a list of users who shared folders, and there is no actual order or popularity, etc. The only logical filter I got to use is flac files, because I want quality.</p> <p>I already downloaded like 3 albums, but I found it weird to navigate. What I wonder is, how do you guys use soulseek to get a better experience? Are there like some public lists of recognised users who share good music? I&#39;

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>hello, hope you are doing well. don&#39;t know if this would be the right sub, but it&#39;s somewhat related. </p> <p>since quite some years ago i have known about PokeMMO and Pokémon Showdown! , but recently i came across the knowledge that there exists AWBW (Advance Wars by Web) and TinyWars, which are the online multi-player versions ofthe Advance Wars games. out of curiosity, and given the similarity to the Advance Wars games, i searched for a Fire Emblem online version and apparently it was available some time ago but discontinued.</p> <p>this got me wondering, are there any other versions of older consoles games which have been ported and made available for online and/or online multi-player play? (i know there are online rooms for games through emulators, but i&#39;m mostly searching for standalone projects)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/dilsexicbacno"> /u/dilsexicbacno </a> <br/> <span><

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am thoroughly aware that most pirates who pirate music on stuff like soulseek most likely don&#39;t use spotify as a player but many casual pirates might use spotify and pirate songs that aren&#39;t on spotify so I&#39;m still posting this here.</p> <p>First of all <strong>what is local files on spotify?</strong> If you&#39;ve been using spotify for a decent bit of time you&#39;ve probably looked into the settings and found a option for local files, but <strong>what does it do?</strong> It lets you play <strong>mp3s flacs</strong> and <strong>other formats</strong> from your files app/device. Why might that be useful? Well many songs are either very underground, not on spotify for licensing reasons or wasn&#39;t on spotify to begin with. Local files also let you sync between multiple devices so you can add a file from your computer, for example <strong>&quot;sweden.flac&quot;</strong> and then download that <em>same</em> <strong>&quot;sweden.flac&q

## I've just installed Autodesk programs from m0nkrus on a virtual machine, I cracked them, it all works. What can I do to know if the install is "safe" (that it has no virus, trojans, keyloggers, ransom, etc)

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>English is not my main language, sorry!</p> <p>I wanted to check if installing 2021, 2023 and 2024 apps and then crack it once (with the 2024 crack) would work. Apparently it works!</p> <p>I downloaded the torrents from the official m0nkrus website (using the rutracker.ru links in his website).</p> <p>I installed everything in a virtual machine just in case. I restarted the VM a few times to check if the crack would &quot;break&quot;, so far so good (the VM doesn&#39;t have internet).</p> <p>Now I would like to check if it is safe to install in my main PC. What are the steps I should take?</p> <p>I would like to know if there&#39;s a virus, trojan, backdoor, keylogger, ransomware, anything. How can I do that?</p> <p>I know that running a full scan using an antivirus or malwarebytes would only look for virus and trojans installed, but what about ports or remote connections to gain access to the pc?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a
