<p>Troy Closson, reporting for The New York Times (gift link):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The optional curriculum, one of most sweeping efforts in recent
years to bring a Christian perspective to more students, would
test the limits of religious instruction in public education.</p>

<p>It could also become a model for other states and for the
administration of President-elect Donald J. Trump, who has

kindergarten, for example, children would be taught that many
religions value the Golden Rule, but the lessons would be focused
on the Christian version, and introduce students to Jesus and his
Sermon on the Mount.</p>

Ravensburger brought out a game designed to help children learn to
count. Around Christmas 2023, I stumbled across a copy of that
vintage game. The type on the box caught my eye, and that’s where
this story began.</p>

<p>The letterforms resembled those of Helvetica. As the corners were
soft, I initially thought it might be its Rounded version.
However, the typeface featured a much larger x-height, the
capitals were less wide, and the glyphs also had white bits in
some places, yielding a highlight effect. I had never seen this
design before. My first suspicion was that it might be a Letraset
face, as this would have fitted in well with the release date of
the game. Unfortunately, I couldn’t find a match in a catalog by
this manufacturer of rub-down type, so I contacted Florian
Hardwig, who had often helped me wi
