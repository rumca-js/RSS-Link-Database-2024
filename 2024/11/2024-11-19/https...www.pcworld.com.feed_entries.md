<p>Look, don’t tell anyone over at our sister site Macworld, but I have to confess: the iPad is pretty great. And that’s coming from someone who’s been an Android die-hard since the Nexus One! Truth be told, I’ve got a fourth-gen iPad Air on my desk that never turns off.</p>



<p>And you know what? Right now, Amazon is offering a fantastic deal on an even newer model: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-Air-11-inch-Intelligence/dp/B0D3J5VFYQ/">the 2024 iPad Air M2 is $100 off</a>.</p>



<p>For just $499, you can get the 11-inch iPad Air, powered by the M2 processor, with 128GB of storage and in four color options. It’s a rare discount on one of Apple’s most popular tablet models — in fact, I’d be surprised to see it go any lower even on Black Friday.</p>



<p>The physical design of the iPad Air hasn’t changed a whisker since 2020, back when the iPa

<p>Back in August a U.S. federal court found Google guilty of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2418714/googles-search-business-ruled-an-illegal-monopoly.html">violating anti-trust laws</a>, and the fallout could be the biggest antitrust action since the breakup of AT&T/Bell way back in the 1980s. But exactly what the enforcement action will look like is still very much in the air. Recent reports indicate that the U.S. Department of Justice is going to suggest that Google be forced to sell the Chrome browser.</p>



<p>That’s<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-18/doj-will-push-google-to-sell-off-chrome-to-break-search-monopoly?embedded-checkout=true"> according to Bloomberg</a>, which has been rock-solid on this case for years. Previously the DoJ was said to be considering some kind of breakup of Google’s big three corporate asset

<p>One of the things that may hold you back from using an old monitor for gaming, photography, graphics editing, or some other visual purpose is that it’s not displaying the kind of vibrant color you want or will find in a new monitor.</p>



<p>There are different reasons that may be the case, ranging from your software settings to the hardware you are using. The good news is that most old monitors whose colors look washed out or inaccurate can be corrected to look a whole lot more colorful and vibrant. Here are the steps to follow to make that happen.</p>

<p>Your email address is a liability when yet another of your accounts get hacked. After your login credentials are leaked, attackers can use those same credentials to try logging into different services across the web to see what else they might unlock.</p>



<p>But there’s a better way — and Google seems poised to bring it to the masses. As spotted by <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-shielded-email-3499803/">Android Authority</a>, a new “Shielded Email” feature in the Gmail app for Android devices is seemingly on the way. It would let you create disposable email addresses, or temporary burner email addresses that forward email to your real account.</p>

<p>In the last two years, Microsoft has invested a lot of money in the ChatGPT inventor Open AI and in its own AI developments.</p>



<p>Since then, Microsoft has been equipping more and more programs with artificial intelligence, above all the Edge browser and Office programs. But AI is also finding its way into Windows.</p>

## 8 mistakes to avoid when buying a used or refurbished laptop

<p>Buying a used laptop can be a great way to save a lot of money, especially if you’re looking to buy one that’s pretty powerful. The <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/436674/the-best-pc-laptops-of-the-year.html">best laptops</a> can be very expensive brand-new, so buying used (or refurbished) can shave off a non-trivial amount — and you still get to enjoy all the same features and performance advantages.</p>



<p>But buying a used laptop can also be fraught with risks. What if the seller lied to you about its condition? What if the battery has been cycled too many times? What if there’s a dead pixel or two on the display? Or what if it doesn’t come with a valid Windows license key?</p>



<p>I addressed a lot of these concerns in my previous article on <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2330136/is-buying-a-used-laptop-safe.html">whether buyin
