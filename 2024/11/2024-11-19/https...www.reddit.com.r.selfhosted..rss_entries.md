<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>About 2 - 3 months ago I transferred my registrar and DNS from GoDaddy to Cloudflare. Ever since, I&#39;ve been having problems with name resolution from the internet to my homelab. I&#39;m traveling right now and have been in a few different hotels and public wifi hotspots over the past few days. I&#39;m attempting to access services on my homelab from the internet. The A and CNAME records are correct in Cloudflare. But I can&#39;t access them and when I ping them their names are resolving to IP addresses that are completely wrong. Any ideas how I can troubleshoot this?</p> <p>Also, earlier today I configured Wireguard on my UniFi Dream Machine and MacBook Pro. The connection is working and I can ping internal IP addresses on my homelab. I&#39;ve never used a Wireguard VPN before; just L2TP VPN&#39;s. Does a Wireguard connection not also leverage my internal DNS servers, as a traditional LT2P VPN would? As I said, I can ping internal devices back at

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I&#39;m a datahoarder with a 10 TB media chest (yes, porn) at a Hetzner Storage Box fronted by a 4 vCPU, 8 GB RAM Arm VPS. I used FileRun on nginx until last week, when I started using Cloudflare for its CDN and it decided it didn&#39;t like FileRun at all. That and the fact that I can&#39;t afford its current version got me in the lookout for an alternative. I read several posts here and tried out Immich. I liked it, but it and its containers didn&#39;t like my puny VPS, throwing load averages over 100 and causing it to meltdown. So, I prefer something that doesn&#39;t try to index and thumbnail those 10 TB of images and videos upfront in one sitting. Before Immich, I tried Caddy&#39;s native file server. I found it awesome, apart from two dealbreakers: no video thumbnails and no media navigation (going from one media to the next without going back to the folder). I liked Caddy so much I decided to try its spin-off Filebrowser. Even more awesome,

You can plug in your own third party API keys or self-host the models as well using Ollama.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone,</p> <p>hope you guys are ready for black Friday.</p> <p>Recently, i was faced with a challenge where i had a campaign with multiple landing pages, each landing page has it&#39;s own design and form to generate leads, i am not that great with designing pages so i was looking around the internet for designs and whenever i liked something, i copy it and start working on it. The issue is editing the code and styling (especially adding new stuff ) was kinda annoying and i was breaking stuff unintentionally due to styling that i didn&#39;t know about.</p> <p>So, i decided to build this tool, it uses <a href="https://grapesjs.com/">GrapeJs </a>as main editor where i was able to edit the design visually without the need for coding, also all forms with fields created are saved automatically for you where you can see Leads (called subscribers in the app) with their information.</p> <p>the app is completely free, open source and can be self hosted

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey self-hosters! 👋</p> <p>I built KVMPods to solve a common frustration with container platforms - the limitations and unpredictable performance of shared infrastructure. It&#39;s a platform that lets you run Docker Compose apps on dedicated KVM servers, giving you:</p> <p>🔸 True isolation with KVM (not shared containers)</p> <p>🔸 Unlimited containers per server</p> <p>🔸 Native Docker Compose support (no modifications needed)</p> <p>🔸 Predictable pricing (€10/mo for 2 vCPU, 4GB RAM, 40GB NVMe, 2TB bandwidth)</p> <p>🔸 Built-in DDoS protection</p> <p>Perfect for:</p> <p>- Self-hosted apps that need multiple containers</p> <p>- Projects that need predictable performance</p> <p>- Anyone tired of usage-based billing surprises</p> <p>Check it out: <a href="https://kvmpods.com">https://kvmpods.com</a></p> <p>Would love to hear your thoughts and feedback! What apps would you deploy?</p> <p>(Note: I am solo building this. All feedback helps!)</p> </div><!--

Here’s my configuration:</p> <ul> <li>I have a Caddy webserver acting as a reverse proxy for several services, including Jellyfin.</li> <li>Caddy is configured with the Cloudflared DNS plugin.</li> <li>The setup is behind a Cloudflared tunnel to avoid opening port 443 on my network.</li> <li>The problem arises when users watch content and skip back and forth.

It also has Adguard installed which acts the DNS server for all devices connected to the wireguard server. All devices are always connected to the wire guard server and that is how they access internal services (use Ad guard DNS rewrites to route to internal ip and use reverse proxy from there to route to internal service).</p> <p>The only things public are a very basic flask application (for collecting some bot stats), static file server and a ntfy server all under a reverse proxy. SSH only works over wire guard tunnel. Only ports 80, 443 and wireguard port are allowed under firewall.

We have a few hundred web applications fully on prem - our skies are fully cloud-free.

Users come from LDAP, groups can be application-managed. Logs are mostly unstructured and usually come from syslog. We don&#39;t need fancy statistics or insight. I just need to be able to look at the application log, maybe filter for a date/time range and read/export those logs.</p> <p>Did I mention the budget is literally zero, no paid license nor subscription? I can only use OSS software. Also bonus points for a) maintenance as low as possible and b) be able to set a retention plan (ideally both storage quota or t
