<p>It took the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) less than a month to decide that there is no need to proceed further with a merger investigation after Google’s purchase of a $2 billion stake in Anthropic.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/671a004867b3ef4856faf8a4/____Commencement_notice____.pdf">statement</a> released on Oct. 24, the CMA indicated that it had obtained “sufficient information” to launch a preliminary investigation into the investment by Google, which was first announced last year and involved an initial sum of $500 million, with the remainder to be invested at a later date.</p>

<p>Apple’s main manufacturing partner, Foxconn, has announced it is working with Nvidia to build digital twins that it says will reshape the future of manufacturing and supply chain management.</p>



<p>Nvidia and Foxconn <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/1637851/apples-iphone-factories-are-going-to-get-much-much-smarter.html">last year announced</a> plans to use Nvidia’s Omniverse platform to create 3D digital twin tech with which to plan and simulate automated production lines. The scheme was first put into effect at Foxconn’s Hsinchu factory in Taiwan and will be scaled out to Foxconn factories worldwide. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3595495/apples-new-m4-based-macbook-pro-line-up-signs-of-a-rapid-evolution.html">new MacBook Pro is everything you expect</a>: faster, better and more capable than before. While you can say that about every new Mac, the move to Apple Silicon means Apple can introduce vastly improved systems almost every year — something that was not always possible before.</p>



<p>I tested a beautiful Space Black MacBook Pro with the new M4 Pro chip and 48GB memory (which I would treasure if it belonged to me). The 3-nanometer chip it uses has 14 cores, consisting of 10 performance and four efficiency cores; it has a 2TB drive; a Liquid Retina XDR nanotexture

<p>So, why is it so many people are still finding it hard to land a job in technology?</p>



<p>This year, large enterprises, including tech giants such as Alphabet (Google), Dell, Intel, Microsoft and Cisco, <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/1617283/tech-layoffs-in-2023-a-timeline.html">have announced significant layoffs</a>.

<p>The US Department of Justice (DOJ) is intensifying its antitrust actions against Google, proposing a historic move that could reshape the tech landscape.
