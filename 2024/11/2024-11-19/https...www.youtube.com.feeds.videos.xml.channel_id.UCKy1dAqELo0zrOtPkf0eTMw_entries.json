Some gamers are reporting that several high-profile games, like Silent Hill 2 Remake, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, and more are having issues when played on a PS5 Pro. Most common is a \"shimmering\" effect on reflections or walls, and it's possibly caused by the PS5 Pro's PSSR upscaling feature. Sony has not yet commented, and as of this recording, the affected games have not been patched. In other news, Sonic the Hedgehog 3 got a new poster, with more detailed looks like Shadow and, Gerald Robotnik. And finally, The Game Awards nominees have been revealed, and controversially Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree has been nominated for Best Game (weird because it's an expansion to a two-year-old game, and not a standalone game by itself).\n\n#IGN #Gaming #PS5", "id": 1540089, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBSmRwqPZ38", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 149, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/fBSmRwqPZ38/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Several Games With PS5 Pro Issues Reported By Players - IGN Daily Fix", "vote": 0}]
