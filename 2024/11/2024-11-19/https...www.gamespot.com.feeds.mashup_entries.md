<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/path-of-exile-2/">Path of Exile 2</a> is the follow-up to the highly successful RPG of the same name that was released in 2013. With the original being released over a decade ago, it's no surprise that it's still missing some modern features that we expect in games today. One of those features is cross-play, which has never been brought to the original Path of Exile. Fortunately, the developers at Grinding Gear Games have confirmed that Path of Exile 2 will feature cross-play support.</p><p>You can learn all about how the feature works and what you need to do to access it in the guide below.</p><h2>How cross-play support works in Path of Exile 2</h2><p>Grinding Gear Games is going in the opposite direction in Path of Exile 2 compared to the original. The upcoming sequel will feature total cross-play support. This means you'll be able to play with any other player, regardless of the platforms you'll be playing on.</p><a href="https://www.game

In a statement to GameSpot, the developer expanded on the news: "Let people speculate, but suffice to say, Control 2 is a natural continuation to the first game, holding on to key tenets of storytelling and spectacle, but leaning even further into player agency, exploration and RPG mechanics."</p><p>Elsewhere in the <a href="https://investors.remedygames.

<p dir="ltr">You really can't understate how historically important Dragon Quest III is. This is not just any JRPG--to players in Japan, it's <em>the defining</em> JRPG, a game that set sales records and truly made Dragon Quest an inextricable part of Japanese pop culture. To this day, it's recognized and referenced in all manner of media, and its wild success is the subject of both nostalgic fascination and urban legends.</p><p dir="ltr">With such a pedigree behind it, it's no surprise that Square Enix has seen fit to re-release Dragon Quest III numerous times, with this HD-2D Remake edition being the latest--and also the most lavish--to date. Logic dictates that a game like this deserves a red-carpet treatment. But unlike Final Fantasy, which is no stranger to changing things up in its recent sequels and remakes, the old-fashioned elements of Dragon Quest's gameplay remain untouched no matter what.</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, the biggest deal about this remake--which its very title
