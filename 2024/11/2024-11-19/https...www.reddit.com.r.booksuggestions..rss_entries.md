<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am reading stuff like Dante, The Odyssey, and Robert Louis Stevenson for school, and those books have raised my reading level way higher than what it was. I have a whole bookshelf in my room of books I have read and loved, but they all have gotten way to easy. I have read books like The River of Time series, Percy Jackson, The Aeneid, Pride and Prejudice, Little Women, The Michael Vey series, Hunger Games, and Chasing Red Bird and greatly enjoyed them all. I was wondering if there are any books that you would recommend to me. I love fantasy, historical fiction, realistic fiction, and sci-fi. I don&#39;t mind a little bit of romance, but nothing overly spicy. I enjoy a tasteful fade to black once the lovers have been married, though.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Diligent_Cod3449"> /u/Diligent_Cod3449 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1gval0h/books_rec

I’m a big fan of Shakespeare and have read a decent number of ancient Greek myths/classics so these books being based on those was a big plus, but I’m ok with any focus really, humanities or science, as long as it’s generally accurate and well-researched.</p> <p>It’s worth noting that I did not like If We Were Villains. I loved the concept, but I thought the execution was lackluster and that it was poorly written and plotted. I’m not looking for something like that in terms of how the book is, but what it could have been.</p> <p>I loved the writing style of The Secret History.</p> <p>I’d prefer adult, but YA is fine too.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello everybody,</p> <p>I am a historian and I work in the migration sector. I am looking for FICTION books set in the now as well as in the past. What is important to me is that it has to be somewhat historically accurate. I&#39;m not saying that everything has to be historical correct but there shouldn&#39;t be too many falsehoods in it either.</p> <p>I live in Belgium and read mainly in Dutch. So hopefully there are translations of the books you recommend. Preferably the story takes place in places I don&#39;t know . I like to read books about African, Latin American, Middle Eastern, Asian, Russian, ... topics. I want to learn constantly because I have the historical interest but can also use this in my contemporary work.</p> <p>Do you guys have any recommendations? Shoot. Thank you. I can also give some recommendations if you are also interested in these topics.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/use

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi, everyone,</p> <p>I’m a huge fan of Roberto Bolaño, particularly for the way he approaches literature: that blend of poetry, raw storytelling, and characters lost in their own worlds. I’m drawn to his ability to delve into the literary underground, capturing broken dreams, difficult loves, and the creative struggles of life in an almost visceral, unpolished way.</p> <p>What fascinates me most is how he distances himself from the traditional literary canon, from that polished style that can sometimes feel overly calculated. Bolaño operated in a different realm—what he called &quot;infrarealism&quot;—where literature isn’t just about telling stories but about exposing itself with all its imperfections, passions, and obsessions.</p> <p>I’m looking for recommendations of authors who, like him, masterfully combine literary depth with a connection to the raw and poetic side of life.

Can be either a completely new world or just the real world with some twists. </p> <p>3) Underdog protagonist. Someone looked down on, and someone who has to find solutions to problems most other characters don’t deal with. Think Tyrion from GOT or Hiccup from HTTYD. </p> <p>4) Large Cast. Self explanatory, I just like stories with lots of characters. Heroes, friends, family, villains, anti-heroes, etc.</p> <p>5) Dysfunctional Family. Probably the one I can do without the most, but I’ve always liked stories that use a dysfunctional family as the emotional core. </p> <p>6) Strong central couple. Some light romance is always fun, I’ve noticed I’m a sucker for the nerdy guy with a girl who could beat him trope,

I think she would probably enjoy a fantasy book/series with similar world-building vibes/magic systems/whatever. She is 16, like I said, and definitely reads above her grade level. I’m open to books classified as adult fiction (like Kristen Hannah) as long as the adult content isn’t explicitly sexual — I’m sure she is finding and reading adult fiction already thanks to tiktok but I would like to stay close-ish to age-appropriate themes, or at least avoid anything that she is likely to unpack in therapy 10 years from now lol. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/aro

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Ok so this book is about a dystopian world where women have formed a camp that seems divine on the outside but has an ugly secret. Men are being kept prisoner for their sperm and if the resulting baby doesn&#39;t turn out to the leaders liking, she kills it. The main characters are a mom and daughter I believe and they have to fight off men while in search of this camp. I remember reading a scene that had something to do with a guy or maybe few guys on a motorcycles trying to hurt them. I want to say that the book jacket was pink but not sure.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/thisishowitalwaysis1"> /u/thisishowitalwaysis1 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1guqkq1/cant_remember_the_title/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1guqkq1/cant_remember_the_title/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So, my father, 53/yt/man, has never been much of a reader. He enjoys art and philosophy through other forms (a lot!). He claims to have only read 2 books in his life. Last year, I was able to get him to read The DaVinci Code (making it three books!). I suggested it because of his interest in conspiracies— the Knights Templar’s secret society, the holy grail pieces, etc. </p> <p>He really enjoyed it, says reading relaxed him and kept him off his phone. I would love to buy him a couple more books (or 10) but I am struggling to find a new one to introduce him to. Any suggestions greatly appreciated!</p> <p>TLDR; my father does not read, but I got him to read The DaVinci Code. would love suggestions of books with a similar vibe for him :<sup>)</sup></p> <p>((the other two books he read were during his school years, his calculus textbook, and Where the Red Fern Grows))</p> <p>Edit: he is not an advanced reader! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello :)) I’ve been wanting to find a good mafia book that has absolutely no romance!!! I’m not a prude or anything but I just want a gritty mafia based book. Think The Sopranos, Goodfellas or The Penguin. Something along those lines. Want it to feel more like a thriller than to be about romance, I just personally find those boring. I already have Jade City by Fonda Lee which is a fantasy series but it sounds very much like what I’m looking for so I’m excited to start that!
