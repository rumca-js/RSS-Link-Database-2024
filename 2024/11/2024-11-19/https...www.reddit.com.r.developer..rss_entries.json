A huge feature (not really a feature) that\u2019s always been our downfall is page loading speed. Once you\u2019re in the page, life is good, switching between in-page tabs is fast, graphs load quickly\u2026 life is good.</p> <p>The issue is when you open up a new page and it takes honestly 4-7 seconds to load every time. It\u2019s absolutely killing us.</p> <p>We\u2019re a little tight on hours right now and have a couple of massive projects for partnerships we\u2019re working on so I do not have the bandwidth to have our developers stop everything we\u2019re doing and solve this.</p> <p>My main dev is great but we just don\u2019t have time to give him 2 weeks to figure out why we are so damn slow.

I made some html that asks some questions to create a profile for the user and it outputs a neat little textbox in squarespace that has the information for their profile but I would like for it to be its own \u201cofficial\u201d profile for said user. I realized a part of the issue was it has no database connected storing the information so I signed up for Zapier to help auto retrieve that user information but now I\u2019m having trouble where to go from here. I still need a database to send this information to that is being retrieved by Zapier and store it but I\u2019m not sure what resources there are for that.
