It’s been a heckuva last 10 months for singer-songwriter Gigi Perez. Returning to her home in New Jersey, Perez started releasing songs as an independent artists … and found that the songs really struck a chord with audiences. Perez’s “Sailor Song” continues to climb the Billboard Hot 100 as well as the streaming charts. It’s made Perez’s head spin a little bit, but it’s also filled her with gratitude.

While on tour, Gigi Perez visited The Current to play solo acoustic versions of her songs. Watch the a performance of "Please Be Rude" above.
