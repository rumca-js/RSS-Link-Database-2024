While my English is decent, reading in English is still slower than in my native language.</p> <p>After discovering immersive translation (which displays original text alongside translations), I thought: why not build an RSS reader with this feature built-in? That&#39;s how PoweReader started.</p> <p>But as I developed it, I realized translation alone wasn&#39;t enough - with hundreds of articles daily, information overload became the next challenge. That&#39;s when I decided to integrate AI to help manage this.</p> <h2>What Makes PoweReader Different</h2> <p>\ud83e\udd16 <strong>AI Fe", "id": 1541526, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1gus8m7/my_rss_reader_powereader_is_now_on_product_hunt", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 482, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "My RSS Reader PoweReader is now on Product Hunt! \ud83d\ude80", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-11-19T05:23:26+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>A MUMBAI court has acquitted <a href=\"https://www.indiaweekly.biz/rss-remarks-case-lyricist-javed-akhtar-acquitted-as-complainant-withdraws-case/\"><strong>veteran lyricist Javed Akhtar</strong></a> in a defamation case against him over his alleged objectionable remarks on the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) as the complainant has withdrawn the case.</p> <p>Judicial Magistrate (First Class), Mulund, S D Chakkar, on November 8 disposed of the case as withdrawn.
