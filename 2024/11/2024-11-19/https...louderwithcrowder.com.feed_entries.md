Hegseth is the author of at least five books, so I chose the most recently published:<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Battle-American-Mind-Uprooting-Miseducation/dp/0063215047/?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_w=OZRUu&content-id=amzn1.sym.255b3518-6e7f-495c-8611-30a58648072e%3Aamzn1.symc.a68f4ca3-28dc-4388-a2cf-24672c480d8f&pf_rd_p=255b3518-6e7f-495c-8611-30a58648072e&pf_rd_r=AWF6HRA4X3GNRZ793CT1&pd_rd_wg=CDfgO&pd_rd_r=60e13af2-cd74-4ae9-8243-7ae59b6cfa5a&ref_=pd_hp_d_atf_ci_mcx_mr_ca_hp_atf_d" target="_blank"> Battle for the American Mind</a>.
