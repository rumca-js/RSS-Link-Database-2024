<p>It’s the difficult second series for the comedy filled with graphic sex and kink exploration. Luckily, it breezes through it by being as impeccably well-observed as ever</p><p>There are hordes of romcoms that could feasibly be renamed Cheaters. Despite the spicy frankness of this dramedy’s title, its premise – Cupid strikes while at least one of the pairing is in a relationship – isn’t actually a novel, modern twist on the format; it’s one of the founding principles of the genre. From <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/16/brief-encounter-romance">Brief Encounter</a> to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/25/sleepless-in-seattle-at-30-nora-ephrons-romcom-tom-hanks-meg-ryan">Sleepless in Seattle</a> to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/apr/13/bridget-jones-diary-at-20-renee-zellweger">Bridget Jones’s Diary</a>, unfaithfulness is the bedrock of many an enthralling love story.</p><p>Cheaters is no exception. <a href="https://www.theguardian.

<p>Given the strides Wales have made under Craig Bellamy in the past three months, for supporters the only dampener is that they now have to wait another four to witness the next step on this journey.</p><p>The bonus is that this result means Wales can look towards making a head start in their bid to qualify for another World Cup. Harry Wilson, who has now scored four goals in his past five matches for his country, capped an impressive comeback victory over Iceland, who led inside seven minutes courtesy of Andri Gudjohnsen. Liam Cullen scored twice before Brennan Johnson got on the scoresheet and Wilson thrashed in a fine strike from distance.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/19/wales-iceland-nations-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>What if no one believed what you knew to be true? Jordan Tannahill’s nuanced thriller about a woman who starts hearing a mysterious noise keeps you constantly off balance</p><p>The question of what you would do if no one believed you is one of the most haunting there is. Believe you about what? Doesn’t matter. What happens if you feel a thing, know a thing or are having a thing happen to you, and you tell people – and no one takes you seriously?</p><p>That is the terrifying question at the heart of the four-part drama The Listeners, adapted by Jordan Tannahill from his book of the same name. The action is moved from the US to the UK, and Rebecca Hall (with a short haircut to allow for the ear-acting involved – you’ll see) plays Claire, a busy wife, mother, friend and a charismatic teacher of literature to teenagers at the local school. Then she, and she (apparently) alone, starts hearing a low, torturous, rumbling hum – from somewhere outside herself. She proves this by putting he

<p>Stephen Schwartz brings his musical prequel to the big screen, with Erivo’s charismatic Elphaba exerting a planetary pull over a star-studded cast</p><p>As Kermit the Frog and the Hulk discovered: it’s not easy being green. Now another verdant character is gleefully brought to the screen by lyricist-producer Stephen Schwartz, screenwriters Winnie Holzman and Dana Fox, and director Jon M Chu in an adaptation of Schwartz’s Broadway musical, the first of two parts. It’s a sugar-rush fantasy with the overpowering star presence of Cynthia Erivo; it basically dunks you face-down in a hyperreal ball pit of M&amp;Ms for two and three-quarter hours.

The sort of protest you might expect from roughly 10,000 asset-rich, cash-poor millionaire farmers from all over the country. The police officers there just to redirect the traffic. Only the occasional shouted slogans to punctuate proceedings; most people were just happy to be there. “What do we want?” “To not pay inheritance tax on our farms.” It had a ring.</p><p>Whitehall has probably never seen so much tweed. Nigel Farage was out there looking like Mr Toad. Flat cap, pristine Barbour jacket, mustard trousers and green wellies. He never can resist a chance to cosplay. Someone might have told him that the streets had been tarmacked a while back. There again, Nige is always willing to piggyback on other people’s grievances.

<p>Tax rises were needed, but Labour must not dismiss the difficulties faced by farming families</p><p>No tax change is perfect. Systems can never be customised to take in every set of circumstances. There&nbsp;are always edge cases – people who are outliers&nbsp;in the groups that new measures are aimed at.

Part surreal exploration of identity, part sendup of Hollywood’s limited view of Asian Americans, it’s a tricky and brilliant balance on the page that doesn’t necessarily translate off it. Yu, a writer for such shows as Westworld and Lodge 49, along with Taika Waititi as executive producer, leads the charge on a dizzyingly circular task: the TV adaptation of his novel in which everyone toils in a TV show. If it sounds too meta, well, that’s both the point and the show’s central flaw – at least, in the first half of 10 episodes made available for critics, which chases its

<p>Thirty years before Megalopolis, there was Coppola’s other deranged, maximalist fable about love lost, starring Gary Oldman as the terrifying Count</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2019/oct/18/saved-for-later-sign-up-for-guardian-australias-culture-and-lifestyle-email?CMP=cvau_sfl">Get our weekend culture and lifestyle email</a></li></ul><p>This year marked the long-awaited return of the American film-making legend Francis Ford Coppola to the cinema, with Megalopolis: a $120m self-financed “fable” with a go-for-broke sensibility, about a time-defying architect trying to build the city of the future in the wake of his wife’s untimely death. Fans of its deranged overtures may do well to revisit Coppola’s other maximalist fable about a time-defying man grappling with his wife’s untimely death: Bram Stoker’s Dracula.</p><p>It was lead actress Winona Ryder who first brought the project to Coppola – as an apology after she abruptly quit Coppola’s third Godfath

<p>Spicy Rhônes for the roast, aromatic riesling for the leftovers, and excellent value fizzes to bring in the new year</p><p>When it comes to choosing the right wines, Christmas dinner is something of a challenge. The classic bird (or plant-based alternative) with all the trimmings is a riot of sensations, flavours and textures, from the soft umami hit of stuffing and gravy to the piercing sweet-sour burst of cranberry sauce and the bitter green tang of sprouts. I tend to go one of two ways: pick out an acid-driven wine (white, red or orange) that will cleanse and revive and cut through the fat; or something substantial and spicy (a beefy red or rich oak-aged white) that stands up to anything you care to throw at it.</p><p>I’ve included several examples of each in this year’s selection, and in a range of prices and sources. There are also wines to take care of aperitifs, puddings, parties and the shapeless hours (and leftovers) of the days after you’ve cleared away the wrapping pape

 Guerrero told the Spanish newspaper Marca she had “hit rock bottom” during her time with United and was upset by her lack of playing time. Guerrero, who now plays for the Mexican club América, spent one season with the club, making three WSL appearances, all as a substitute, playing 26 minutes, and madeone start in the League Cup.</p><p>In a lengthy interview the World Cup-winning Spain midfielder said: “I remember mid-training session, going to the bathroom and having to let it out, cry, wash my face and go out to train as if nothing had happened.

<p><strong>Theatre503, London<br></strong>The heightened body language of a tempestuous couple breaks out into choreographed scenes in this play that reaches far beyond its restricted space</p><p>It doesn’t look like much: the stage is tiny, the set is a single room, spare and compact, and there are only two characters, Him and Her. Yet writer-director <a href="https://www.dkfash.com/">dkfash</a> makes By Their Fruits feel deep and dense, and wide and open – as if reaching into the ground beneath and the sky above that central relationship.</p><p>Him and Her (winningly played by Ivan Oyik and Reba Ayi-Sobsa) are quite a pair, taking swipes at each other and making up, enjoying then falling out over the games they play – not in a toxic, Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf way, but with heart and soul and humour. And body too: their language is as much physical as verbal, full of stances and glances, their touches, swerves, brush-offs and embraces enforcing or contradicting the words they s

<p>A broken NHS makes life worse for everyone. What happened to the dream of promoting ‘good health in all citizens’?</p><p>The <a href="https://www.rcog.org.uk/">Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists</a> has landed on an arresting image to illustrate the waiting-list crisis in its field. If all 760,000 women waiting for NHS gynaecological appointments were to stand in a line, the queue would go from London to Exeter. It’s great for visualisation, but it also rams home what a criminal waste of human energy this represents – the awful pressing interminability.

<p>Film-maker Duncan Cowles braves his discomfort to address men’s inability to talk about their problems</p><p>Called to confront his ultimate fear – expressing his emotions on camera – Scottish documentary-maker Duncan Cowles occasionally assumes a furtive, wary expression. So he deserves credit not just for facing his own inhibitions in his debut full-length film, but for broaching the vast, ever more discussed, but still maddeningly nebulous topic of men’s mental health – and in an ingeniously light way.</p><p>With his kinda, whatchamacallit, you know, beating-around-the-bush narration, and propensity to zone out while shooting pretty shots of bumblebees, Cowles plays up the fact he’d rather be discussing anything but this. But freaked out by his own inability to tell his parents he loves them, he canvasses his family and friends about their emotional makeup. His father reckons Cowles’s taciturnity set in because of the general silence around his own dad’s alcoholism. One pal has

<p>Numerous innovative goldrush proposals have fallen away over the years after coming into contact with reality</p><p>The breathless headlines looked exciting. “Global rebel league” and “Rugby revolution” are certainly catchy and guaranteed to attract clicks. As with the Kerry Packer cricket circus in the 1970s and the more recent LIV golf saga, sport’s traditional overlords can periodically be blindsided by wealthy interlopers who claim they can do better.</p><p>At a time when rugby could clearly do with some major fresh investment the timing was tantalising, too. One million quid a year on offer to the best 40 players? No wonder a few of them – anonymously, of course – have expressed provisional interest in grabbing the nearest available pen and signing up. The key word there, of course, being provisional. It would all depend, naturally, on the precise nitty-gritty of the enterprise being floated.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/nov/19/rugby-union-breakaway-lea

Why is it taking so long?</p><p>The day after Rachel Reeves, in her first budget as chancellor, denounced potholes as a “visible reminder of our failure to invest as a nation”, Sarah Wright is staring at a £73,000 repair bill. The carer, 59, has become something of a celebrity thanks to her Hertfordshire cul-de-sac’s 70-year battle over potholes. “This is not my comfort zone – it makes me feel anxious,” she says of speaking to the press, “but I can do it because I’m doing it for these people.

<p>Tucked away near Helford River, 19th-century Frenchman’s Creek is rented by the Landmark Trust and offers serenity and cobweb-blasting walks</p><p>I don’t remember when I first heard about Frenchman’s Creek. Not Daphne du Maurier’s pirate romance, but the house of the same name near the Helford River. An old stone cottage, the colour of clotted cream, that hides in the woods by a burbling stream. Perhaps I dreamed it? I stayed once, one winter, but still sometimes wonder if it actually exists.</p><p>This corner of Cornwall has that place-out-of-time feel. Unlike the brazen drama of the wave-smacked coast, there’s a peace and a secrecy to the Helford River. Once a bustling highway, now this sinuous passage is left largely to the ancient oaks, the prehistoric herons and the ghosts of smugglers’ ships – the kind that inspired du Maurier, who honeymooned there. This feeling is even more palpable in winter, when the grockles have gone and the ferry – there’s been a crossing at Helford

Here’s what to watch this evening</p><p><strong>9pm, BBC One</strong><strong><br></strong>A curious new drama – from the producers of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/apr/26/normal-people-review-sally-rooney-bbc-hulu">Normal People</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/aug/30/the-favourite-review-olivia-colman-yorgos-lanthimos">The Favourite</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/sep/01/poor-things-review-yorgos-lanthimos-emma-stone">Poor Things</a> – that will have you guessing throughout and leave you with a phantom buzzing in your ears. Rebecca Hall is Claire, a teacher, wife and mother who one night notices a low-level humming noise that doesn’t go away. It’s not tinnitus and the doctors are stumped, which leaves Claire feeling isolated, exhausted and acting oddly towards her family. Some r

<p>If it wants to build 1.5m homes, the government will sometimes need to be brave enough to reject local feeling – as it has done in Swale</p><p>Watch what happens in Swale, as it’s a tale that will be repeated often in the next few years. Here in Kent is a test of Labour’s determination to plough through local planning decisions in order to build the homes everyone knows are needed in a national housing crisis. The issue is this: in a time when localism is in vogue, who’s in charge? The democratically elected local council or the Westminster government elected on a key pledge to build 1.5m homes in five years? It’s also a question of the balance of power between developers and government: housebuilders need to make a profit, but they must be kept to their promises.</p><p>Two weeks ago, Swale borough council’s planning committee was meeting to vote on an application to build a garden village. The site for 8,400 new houses near Sittingbourne includes plans for affordable homes, schoo

<p>Paul Mescal’s thoughtful Lucius is worlds away from Russell Crowe’s stony Maximus, 24 years ago. Why have our masculine ideals changed so much?</p><p>Maybe it’s because Paul Mescal in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/nov/11/gladiator-2-review-paul-mescal-ridley-scott">Gladiator II</a> is younger than Russell Crowe was in the original (Mescal was 27 and Crowe was 35 during filming). Or maybe it’s because Mescal has a wry, sunny energy, and Crowe something more like the bright red character in Inside Out (what’s his name again? Oh yes, Anger)? It’s something, anyway, because the two films, both directed by Ridley Scott, give us two different versions of masculinity – not just in terms of the actors’ vibes, but how they deal with women, geopolitics and battle. And also how they see humour and sexuality. So what has changed for men in the 24 years between each release?</p><p>It’s impossible to overstate how much impact Crowe had when the first film was released in 2000.
