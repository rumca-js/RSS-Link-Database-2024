Today Rob and I are checking out BLKOUT... the 32mm Near-Future Skirmish game by Enemy Spotted Studio. Let's dive in! 

In the first mission the 1st Reaction Group of Harlow take on Manticor's BORZ in a Dockyard Assault mission to seize control of a part of container stacks. 

Thanks to Enemy Spotted for the copy of the rules and Harlow group to check out!
