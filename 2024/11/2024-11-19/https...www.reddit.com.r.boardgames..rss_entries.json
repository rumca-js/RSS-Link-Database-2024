I was the o e to introduce it to them and now it\u2019s part of our \u201clife\u2019s\u201d when we get together, I tried to introduce other games like Avalon, ticket to ride, Bang, but even though they like the other games they still insist on playing Catan. I was wondering if anybody have any game recommendations to see if I can break this addiction. I was thinking abou t offering a board game to everybody but still not sure which one to offer. If you please have recommendations based on what I said I will be very thankful! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/PossibilityAnnual689\"> /u/PossibilityAnnual689 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1gv0lik/tired_of_catan/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments", "id": 1544394, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1gv0lik/tired_of_catan", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 473, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Tired of Catan", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-11-19T15:59:32+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hello guys, just wanted to ask a quick question, did any one of you try out Legion?

Literally every time the new wonders come up when I play online, they are always automatic first picks, solely because of their starting bonus. And science is only drafted very, very rarely because the other win cons give much better bonuses along the way. I think both can be easily remedied as well, which almost makes it even more frustrating. Just modify the wonders slightly so that their starting bonus is removed and their activation ability is strengthened slightly and adapt the way the science tokens to make them work like they do in lord of the rings duel. Everything else is really good I think and for me easily matches Pantheon in", "id": 1540109, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1gujrpc/what_keeps_7_wonders_duel_agora_from_being_as", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 473, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "What keeps 7 Wonders Duel Agora from being as revered as Pantheon?", "vote": 0}]
