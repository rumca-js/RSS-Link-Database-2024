I'm often asked... no really what is the best drawing tablet deal and for my money the entry level 9th gen iPad still holds up super well and the Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 lie on the android side is comparable. There is definitely better tech to draw on out there but for the price you're getting a terrific value.
