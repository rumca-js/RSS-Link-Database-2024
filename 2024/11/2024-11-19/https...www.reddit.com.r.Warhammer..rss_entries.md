She&#39;s said a few times she thinks the hobby may be difficult for her, as many people assume when they want to try painting and the like, but she is a massive book fan.</p> <p>I&#39;ve not read any of the novels as of yet, though I&#39;ve tried to start a few I end up getting busy, reading regularly isn&#39;t my forte. So I&#39;m looking for a recommandation on a book she may enjoy.</p> <p>Open to any of the settings, she is a huge fan of horror, the occult, and fantasy. </p> <p>All suggestions welcome!</p> <p>Cheers,</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Mycoe"> /u/Mycoe </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer/comments/1guwfob/recommendation_for_a_black_library_book/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Warh

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello! I decided roughly a couple of weeks ago that I wanted to purchase and start collecting some Warhammer 40k minis and started to research on what to buy. I decided on Deathwatch, since I liked the lore behind them and their look. (Definitely not inspired at all by Space Marine 2)</p> <p>Just as a small point of history, I used to collect a bunch of different Warhammer armies in the later half of the 90&#39;s, when I was around 7-10 years old. I had wood elves, chaos dwarves, vampire counts and Eldar. I still have a bunch of old WH stuff in my storage, courtesy of my parents finding them from their attic a couple of years ago. They are in pretty rough condition. Notably I still have a chaos dwarf lammasu with a sorc lord and a great taurus with a normal lord. I also have a random box of a bunch of metal minis that I have no idea what they are or where they are from really.</p> <p>That aside, I have not bought, collected or painted any minis in th

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Something I am having a hard time wrapping my head around, is the concept of crumbling from a lore and fluff perspective.</p> <p>It makes total sense that something like the puppeteering necromancer/vampire being distracted or wounded or killed would cause the undead to unravel.</p> <p>But other things that cause them to crumble don’t make as much sense, like the fear and terror inflicted by monsters. Why would that have any effect on the undead that are not conscious, just a pile of bones reanimated magically? Or army losses, what does a skeleton or zombie care how many losses are inflicted? On tabletop, they even take a leadership check, no different to a living unit. If the undead don’t have minds of their own, how can these things affect them?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/BigGenital"> /u/BigGenital </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer/comments/1guozkd/clarification_
