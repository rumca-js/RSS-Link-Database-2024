It'd be fair to say the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-movie-trailer-gives-first-look-at-block-stars-jason-momoa-and-jack-black-in-action">live-action Minecraft movie's first trailer</a> didn't exactly arrive to rapturous applause. But now Warner Bros. and Legendary Pictures are back for a second try, this time unleashing the deep Steve lore, tree punching, teleporting Ender Pearls, an unfortunate incident involving a chicken, and even an adorable square bee.

But in a turn of events almost exactly mirroring the launch day woes seen by its 2020 predecessor, Flight Simulator 2024 is struggling to gt off the ground, with players complaining of lengthy post-install download times, installation freezes, and more as Microsoft's servers buckle under the demand.

Sometimes the hippo ate the fruit, which was what I intended. Sometimes the fruit missed and rolled away and was lost forever. Sometimes - very occasionally - I pressed the wrong button and ate the fruit myself. A pain, really, because the fruit is quite hard to gather and stock up on.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/towers-of-aghasba-offers-mindless-pleasures-and-tiny-hippos-to-pelt-with-fruit">Read more</a></p>

A month after its October release, frame-rate drops still detract from the base PS5 experience - in both its 60fps performance and 30fps quality modes - all of which makes the prospect of new hardware fixing the issue rather compelling. There's an air of mystery surrounding this PS5 Pro upgrade, though. Developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bloober-team">Bloober Team</a> makes no explicit mention of Pro support in its patch notes and all we have to go on is a brief note on the PlayStation Store that it has a Pro patch.

Unfortunately, the same can't be said for London shop worker Michelle. Not only is she still reeling from a bad break-up with her very human girlfriend that happened several years previously, but she's also recently caught the eye of a very demanding arch-demon called The Duchess who simply won't take no for an answer - cursing Michelle with a third eye and the prospect of death and eternal damnation if she doesn't submit to love The Duchess in three days' time.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sorry-were-closed-review">Read more</a></p>
