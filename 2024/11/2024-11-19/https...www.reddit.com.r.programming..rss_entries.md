<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi guys, I&#39;m working on a project where the code will be deployed on the customer&#39;s own server. While I trust the customer, I&#39;m concerned about the potential for code theft or misuse. Specifically, I&#39;m worried that someone might be able to access ans steal or redistribute the code once it&#39;s on their infrastructure. Have you faced similar situations? What methods have you succesfully used to protect your code when deploying it on customer-owned servers? I&#39;d appreciate any advice or best practices.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/flerinaks"> /u/flerinaks </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://medium.com/@CAIOStech/how-to-protect-your-source-code-in-the-cloud-cf7a4cd69c2e">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1gv5jos/what_methods_do_you_recommend_to_prevent_code/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey <a href="/r/Programming">r/Programming</a>,</p> <p>I’ve been working on a project that processes raw iPhone camera data in real time, applying dynamic enhancements like stabilization, UV filtering, and even simulated AC130-style thermal effects. This all runs through a compact, custom-built pipeline using a relational neural network and a 4D programming framework I’ve been experimenting with.</p> <p>The framework models state changes in video data over time, mapping it into a “4D” structure that includes spatial, temporal, and attribute dimensions. This allows for real-time effects that adapt dynamically as the camera moves or conditions change.</p> <p>The cool part? It’s running off consumer-grade hardware—a MacBook paired with an iPhone using Continuity Camera as the feed. The framework’s focus is on lightweight, efficient processing that could be adapted for mobile devices or edge computing.</p> <p>I’m not entirely sure how this compares to ho
