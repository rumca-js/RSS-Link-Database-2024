## After 10 years and the conclusion of the primary plot, it was time to move on from Destiny, but damn if I dont miss how they integrated PVP and PVE

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>It caused problems in both sandboxes no <em>doubt,</em> but as someone who enjoyed both modes the integration felt amazing, and it was well worth the balancing irregularities. </p> <p>I get that there were a lot of pve only players, and that nerfs for pvp balancing were annoying, but for me it was a dream come true. </p> <p>It was such a cool way to feel invested and engaged in both modes. Grinding for that god roll felt so rewarding when I could go take it into crucible. Grinding that crucible shader felt so cool when I could go show it off in a raid. </p> <p>Im glad to be playing other games, other pvp, other pve, but nothing on the market right now gives me that same feeling of stepping into the shoes of <em>my</em> character and playing with them. </p> <p>For all its ups and downs over the last decade, it was a really special game. I hope something similar comes along sooner than later!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="h
