<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Doing some research on wireless display takeover for a repo/tool im developing (will publish when done)</p> <p>So far, I have successfully been able to take over AirPlay and chrome cast devices via various techniques, but there’s isn’t much out there about miracast. When miracast is pin protected does anyone know if this is simply a wps pin that can be reavered? If anyone has looked into miracast hijacking/hacking I would love to know what you have found.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/DashByManyNames"> /u/DashByManyNames </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking_Tutorials/comments/1gv3ydb/miracastmicrosoft_wireless_da/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking_Tutorials/comments/1gv3ydb/miracastmicrosoft_wireless_da/">[comments]</a></span>
