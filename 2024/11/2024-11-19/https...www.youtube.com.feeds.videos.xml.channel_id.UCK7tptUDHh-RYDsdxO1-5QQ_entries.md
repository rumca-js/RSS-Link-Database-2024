Ukraine fired long-range U.S. missiles inside Russia for the first time despite Moscow’s threats of retaliation. The attack hit an ammunition storage facility near the Russian city of Karachev and is the first such assault to use long-range, NATO-made arms. 

WSJ’s Alistair MacDonald explains why the Kremlin sees this as a major escalation.

The Nairobi National Museum in Kenya is home to million-year-old fossils, an unparalleled collection of insects, tens of thousands of bones and a fossilized skeleton crucial to our understanding of humanity. Despite its significance, the museum’s roughly 10 millions specimens are at risk as years of limited resources, mismanagement and corruption have left it in a state of dilapidation and decay. 

WSJ visits the museum and investigates how an international coalition of scientists is racing to save the museum and secure the millions needed to overhaul it in order to restore the institution and its vast collection to a state more befitting its immense importance to humanity.
