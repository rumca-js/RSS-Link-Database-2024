<p>Microsoft has added new security features to Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) and the Windows Package Manager (WinGet), including integration with Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Active Directory) for identity-based access control. The goal is to enable IT admins to more effectively manage the deployment and use of these tools in enterprises. </p>



<p>The improvements were announced at the <a href="https://ignite.microsoft.com/en-US/home">Microsoft Ignite conference</a>. </p>



<p>For WSL, Microsoft Entra ID integration is in private preview. Entra ID integration will provide a “zero trust” experience for users accessing enterprise resources from within a WSL distribution, providing better sec

<p>Microsoft is packaging its Azure AI Studio and other updates into a new service — Azure AI Foundry in response to enterprises’ need to develop, run, and manage generative AI applications.</p>



<p>Launched at the company’s annual Ignite conference, Azure AI Foundry is being marketed as a “unified application platform in the age of AI,” akin to the <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2335851/azure-ai-studio-a-nearly-complete-toolbox-for-ai-development.html">Azure AI Studio</a>, which was released in November last year and made <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2337376/microsoft-azure-ai-gains-new-llms-governance-features.html">generally available in May this year</a>.</p>

<p>From automating workflows to unlocking new insights, <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3689973/what-is-generative-ai-artificial-intelligence-that-creates.html">generative AI</a> models like OpenAI’s GPT-4 are already delivering value in enterprises across every industry. But with this power comes a critical challenge for organizations: How do they secure and manage the expanding ecosystem of AI applications that touch sensitive business data? Generative AI solutions are popping up everywhere—embedded in platforms, integrated into products, and accessible via public tools.</p>



<p>In this article, we introduce a practical framework for categorizing and securing generative AI applicati

<p>I recall my angst about my first visit to an architecture review board (ARB), where a team of enterprise architects reviewed plans for new systems and application architectures. My presentation was required to follow a template and be reviewed by the board’s infrastructure and security leads prior to the presentation.</p>



<p>The corporate CIO selected and procured the technology platforms, so I didn’t expect any issues with using them. However, my teams were still learning about these technologies and the business requirements. At best, we had a conceptual architecture that would go through our agile development process to be refined and improved upon.</p>



<p>Our architecture was approved
