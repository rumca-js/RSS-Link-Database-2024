Back to Basics: Almost Always Vector - Kevin Carpenter - CppCon 2024
---

Are you a fresh face in the world of C++ development, or perhaps you've got a bit of experience under your belt? Have you ever stopped to marvel at just how often std::vector pops up? It's a thing of beauty, a structure you can just keep piling data into, effortlessly sort, search, insert, and delete from. But do you know the price you pay for all this convenience? What about when you need to expand the structure? Or when you're on the hunt for something specific? Ever dabbled with custom predicates to dynamically tweak your data? With a plethora of data structures at our disposal in the standard library, it's a head-scratcher why std::vector seems to steal the show. 

Join this talk to unravel the mystery behind why we almost always opt for std::vector, and learn how to wield it with maximum efficiency.
