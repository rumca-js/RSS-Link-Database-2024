Wicked, reviewed by Alyssa Mora.

Wicked is a well-oiled machine in the hands of Jon M. Chu. This film adaptation epitomizes what modern movie musicals can and should be, embracing its source material while cleverly translating it to screen. Tear-jerking performances by Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo make the movie, playing to their individual strengths to bring to life the rapport between Glinda and Elphaba, who’ll go on to become the good and wicked witches of Wizard of Oz fame. If as many people love this film as much as I did, Wicked will undoubtedly immortalize the Grande and Erivo in movie musical history.

From Warner Bros. Pictures and Legendary Pictures and starring Jason Momoa and Jack Black, “A Minecraft Movie,” directed by Jared Hess, is the first-ever big-screen, live-action adaptation of Minecraft, the best-selling video game of all time.

Welcome to the world of Minecraft, where creativity doesn’t just help you craft, it’s essential to one’s survival! Four misfits—Garrett “The Garbage Man” Garrison (Momoa), Henry (Hansen), Natalie (Myers) and Dawn (Brooks)—find themselves struggling with ordinary problems when they are suddenly pulled through a mysterious portal into the Overworld: a bizarre, cubic wonderland that thrives on imagination. To get back home, they’ll have to master this world (and protect it from evil things like Piglins and Zombies, too) while embarking on a magical quest with an unexpect

## Several Games With PS5 Pro Issues Reported By Players - IGN Daily Fix

In today's Daily Fix:
The PS5 Pro is currently the most powerful game console you can buy, but that doesn't mean it's running every game without problems. Some gamers are reporting that several high-profile games, like Silent Hill 2 Remake, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, and more are having issues when played on a PS5 Pro. Most common is a "shimmering" effect on reflections or walls, and it's possibly caused by the PS5 Pro's PSSR upscaling feature. Sony has not yet commented, and as of this recording, the affected games have not been patched. In other news, Sonic the Hedgehog 3 got a new poster, with more detailed looks like Shadow and, Gerald Robotnik. And finally, The Game Awards nominees have been revealed, and controversially Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree has been nominated for Best Game (weird because it's an expansion to a two-year-old game, and not a standalone game by itself).
