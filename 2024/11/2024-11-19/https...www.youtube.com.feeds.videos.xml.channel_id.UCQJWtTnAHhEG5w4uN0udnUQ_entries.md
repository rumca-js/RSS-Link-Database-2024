About The Boys: THE BOYS is an irreverent take on what happens when superheroes, who are as popular as celebrities, as influential as politicians and as revered as Gods, abuse their superpowers rather than use them for good. It's the powerless against the super powerful as The Boys embark on a heroic quest to expose the truth about “The Seven,” and their formidable Vought backing.

Walter is obvious – there’s only one man who can play Scrooge! But when Jeff assigns Bubba J, Peanut, Little Jeff and Achmed their thespian parts, they don’t quite agree and his plan spins hilariously out-of-control in this stand-up comedy special.
