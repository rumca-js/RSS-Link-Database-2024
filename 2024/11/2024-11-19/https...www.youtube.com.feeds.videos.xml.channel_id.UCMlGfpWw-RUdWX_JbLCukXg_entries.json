Have you ever stopped to marvel at just how often std::vector pops up? It's a thing of beauty, a structure you can just keep piling data into, effortlessly sort, search, insert, and delete from. But do you know the price you pay for all this convenience? What about when you need to expand the structure? Or when you're on the hunt for something specific?
