Today on the Matt Walsh Show, it has finally come to light that the illegal immigrant who murdered Laken Riley in Georgia was transported to the state on a taxpayer-funded flight set up by the Biden administration. The government directly facilitated the murder of an American citizen. Also, Jen Psaki insists that Democrats must double down on their most unpopular and roundly rejected ideas. “Morning Joe” bows and kisses Trump's ring in a humiliating and debasing display. And, "girl math" makes its way into the government.
