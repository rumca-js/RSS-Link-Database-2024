Scotland threw everything at this match, setting their beloved stadium on a roar time and again, but four tries to none tells its own story. And a familiar one at that. South Africa, without ever really seeming to play much more than within themselves, were just too strong.</p><p>The image of a lusty puncher failing to land a single blow came to mind, as the Springboks held a swinging Scotland at arm’s length, rarely too troubled, for all their opponents’ fire and enthusiasm. Time and again either side of half-time, Scotland broke out, but they could not quite score a try, let alone four of them. Eben Etzebeth, the only Springbok forward to play the whole match, was the icon, huge, commanding and, at times, laughing in his opponents’ faces.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/nov/10/scotland-south-africa-autumn-nations-series-rugby-unio

<p>Garth Greenwell’s new novel gets as close as one can to evoking the very real indignity and physicality of being in hospital</p><p>Every now and then I try to write down a description of pain, whether labour, tooth or head, and it becomes a frustrating little game in which nobody ever wins. Doctors try to quantify our pain by asking us to rate it on a scale of one to 10, or by pointing at a variety of sad faces – the McGill Pain Questionnaire consists of 78 possible words to tick, which include “tugging”, “terrifying” and “dull”, words that gamely poke around inside a feeling, but rarely fully land. Often, I wonder if there are some states, like pain, that just defy description – occasionally you think you have it and then the image turns in on itself and loops around and it’s lost – but then I read something like Garth Greenwell’s new novel <em>Small Rain</em>, which begins with our narrator bent double with a twisting pain in his gut.

In the 10 years between 1968 and 1978, Robert (Bob) Edwards, a scientist, Patrick Steptoe, an obstetrician, Jean Purdy, an embryologist, worked together, with many others, to do something incredible. Basing themselves in an outbuilding at Oldham general on scraps of money, with nurses volunteering their time, and patients their patience, they worked incessantly on the issue of infertility.</p><p>Bob had had a number of breakthroughs working with mice and rabbits, and thought that with Patrick’s innovations with laparoscopes (keyhole surgery), there was a possibility that tubal infertility could be, at least partially,&nbsp;cured.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/nov/10/screenwriter-jack-

It is rooted in empathy, aiming to uplift and empower, rather than control. It aims to provide clarity and direction while encouraging self-reflection, allowing the person to find their own answers.

On point, well-timed advice is one thing, but not all advice is wanted.</p><p>Unwelcome advice is a common problem, especially in the age of social media, where everyone feels free to offer their opinions without being asked.
