<p>The final instalment of Hilary Mantel’s masterpiece is the most intricate television you are ever likely to see. It is so beautifully made it’s breathtaking</p><p>It seems pleasingly apropos that it is almost impossible to believe that the adaptation of Hilary Mantel’s Wolf Hall appeared on our screens almost a decade ago. Whether you were reading her masterpiece or watching its fruits, carefully peeled and arranged for our delectation by screenwriter Peter Straughan and director Peter Kosminsky, the years between us and the Tudors shrank to nothingness. Time no longer.</p><p>The 2015 series covered the first two books in the trilogy – Wolf Hall and Bring Up the Bodies – taking the story of Thomas Cromwell, Putney blacksmith’s boy and adviser to Henry VIII, through the negotiation of the end of the king’s marriage to Catherine of Aragon, his break with Rome, the crowning of Anne Boleyn and finally – though you ludicrously kept hoping otherwise – her execution, contrived to clear t

<p>This mesmerising docuseries is full of astonishing interviews as it examines the Metropolitan police shooting of an innocent man – two weeks after the London bombings and terrorist threats of July 2005</p><p>This two-parter is a mesmerising feat of rigorous documentary-making. For the first time, the unnamed Metropolitan police officer who shot and killed <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/menezes">Jean Charles de Menezes</a> speaks out publicly, giving a raw and detailed interview about what happened on the morning of 22 July, 2005, and in the years that followed. De Menezes was an electrician from Brazil, taking the London Underground to work from Stockwell station. An innocent man, he was wrongly suspected of being a suicide bomber. He was shot once in the shoulder and seven times in the head.</p><p>Over two gripping episodes, this documentary lays the foundations for its story and then unpicks every aspect of it, examining each element carefully, critically and with compa

<ul><li>WSL roundup: Hayashi rescues struggling Everton</li><li>West Ham claim first win of the season against Leicester</li></ul><p>When <strong>Crystal Palace</strong> midfielder My Cato found herself with the ball to the left, inside a minute at the VBS Community Stadium, the <strong>Everton</strong> defence followed, three of the back four shifting across and then looking back over their shoulders in horror as an unmarked Indiah-Paige Riley collected the pass from Cato in the middle before slotting home.</p><p>If there was a moment to symbolise Everton’s woes this season, this was it, their defensive structure collapsing in an instant against Palace before the game had really begun. It was the fifth time in seven WSL games that the injury-hit Toffees had conceded inside 15 minutes, four of those coming inside eight minutes. Against a Chelsea or a Manchester United, that can be forgiven to some extent, but that the other three early concessions have come against fellow relegation

<p>There were people on the pitch, Chelsea substitutes to be precise, the joy of everyone connected to the club overflowing. Pedro Neto had produced the equaliser with a vicious low drive from distance and if it did not turn out to be the statement victory that Enzo Maresca and his players wanted – the first against a so-called Big Six rival – they could see the merit in a battling draw.</p><p>For Arsenal, this was a better performance than some of those of late and yet it was not the result that Mikel Arteta had called for, the one to silence the noise that has built around his club. It was another example of them losing the lead in a big game – following the draws against Manchester City and Liverpool – and it meant they have not won in four Premier League games, a sequence that has yielded just two points. They are now nine behind the leaders, Liverpool. Is it too much to recover?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/10/chelsea-arsenal-premier-league-match-re

Short cuts kept close to a head’s profile, longer bobs swung in movement but dropped straight as a curtain at rest.</p><p>Then in 1974, Sassoon’s young artistic director, Trevor Sorbie, saw how a model’s locks fell full and chunky as he pulled a brush through them, and, impromptu, cut that shape into her hair. This was 3D geometry. Voila, the Wedge, so striking that Vogue allotted it an unprecedented double-page spread.

<p>Writer best known for the novel Gabriel’s Lament and a sympathetic biography of the brothel madam Cynthia Payne</p><p>The writer Paul Bailey, who has died aged 87, believed in ignoring surfaces or trying to see past them – to identify what was special about the ordinary and overlooked, and what was recognisable and understandable in the unfamiliar. His first career was in acting, and he always aimed to escape narrow egoism. Like the hero of his wonderfully entertaining novel Peter Smart’s Confessions (1977), Bailey “hated self-display” and was a “keen observer of it in others”.</p><p>His lifelong suspicion of preciousness was reflected in the priorities and approach of his work as novelist, critic and broadcaster. Reviewing his weekly <a href="https://www.nicholasmonsour.com/blog/angela-carter-bbc-radio-3-interview-1991.html">Radio 3 conversations with writers</a> (1988-92), the Daily Telegraph described him as a “perfect interviewer”.’</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/boo

<p>A new account of the months Simpson spent in China debunks the well-worn gossip about sexual adventures and opium addiction and even invites admiration for a ‘buccaneering’ woman</p><p>The seemingly never-ending obsession with Wallis Simpson on the part of writers, publishers and (presumably) readers is at this point beginning to seem quite crazed. What more can there be left to say? But always, another book; and always, the <em>Daily Mail </em>will make the most of the scraps it dishes up. Paul French’s <em>Her Lotus Year</em> claims to tell “for the first time” the full story of the months the future Duchess of Windsor spent in China in the mid-1920s. Not only does it arrive highly praised by other Simpson biographers (it’s as if they all belong to a syndicate or something), but the <em>Mail </em>has already run a helpfully piquant piece featuring the sexual techniques Simpson supposedly learned while she was up to nothing-very-much in Hong Kong, Shanghai and what was then Pekin

 The artistic director of Melbourne-based Chunky Move, Antony Hamilton, has designed a kind of algorithm to create the counts of the choreography for 4/4.

<p><strong>Tanya Moiseiwitsch Playhouse, Sheffield<br></strong>Holden and Ed Stambollouian’s one-man drama based on a real-life murder in 80s America uses film tropes to great effect – but it plays with the facts too</p><p>Two wrongs don’t make a right, or do they? Ken Rex McElroy was “the town bully”, the things he did, or is said to have done, were bad: arson, assault, cruelty to animals, statutory rape, theft. On 10 July 1981 he was shot dead in his pickup in the presence of dozens of townsfolk. No one has ever been charged with his murder.</p><p>Subtitled “A True Crime Thriller”, this new play, set in the American midwest, is based on actual events and real people. How “true” it is to either is questionable. Co-writers Jack Holden, who performs all onstage roles, of which there are least 11, and Ed Stambollouian, who directs, say they have “changed or imagined” facts “for dramatic purposes”. The distinction between dramatic licence and misrepresentation, always fine, here feels b

<p>In this republished novella from 2000 about a fisherman and his son, the Norwegian writer captures the puzzlement and wonder of the human condition</p><p>Few writers working today capture the liminality of life as viscerally as the Norwegian 2023 Nobel prize winner Jon Fosse, and in <em>Morning and Evening</em>, his newly republished 2000 novella (elegantly translated by Damion Searls), we follow one person’s passage from womb to Earth, and from Earth to the afterlife, in a near seamless progression. This, then, is not a novel that describes a life; it is a fable about the very beginning and end of a life – a metaphysical ghost story.</p><p>The two-part book opens with a woman delivering her second child in a house on the island of Holmen. Olai, the father whose perspective we inhabit, waits anxiously in the kitchen. Could both baby and mother die? No, “God surely doesn’t want that”, but then Olai has “never doubted that Satan rules this world as much as the good Lord does”. As in

<p>Newly unearthed studies by young private Henry Page have been published to mark Rememberance Sunday</p><p>“Wish I was at home for Christmas,” runs the chorus of Stop the Cavalry, the seasonal anti-war pop song, in a lyric that voices the dreams of serving soldiers down the ages. The same poignant sentiment is illustrated in the rediscovered drawings of the first world war trench artist and cartoonist Henry Page. But Page, who was a young private in the London Regiment, also wishes he could be at home for spring, summer, and autumn too, “in the arms of the girl I love”.</p><p>His landscape sketches and studies of fellow soldiers have been unearthed by researchers working at Southwark Archives in south London and offer an astonishing fresh insight into the life of troops who survived in close quarters and travelled together through countries very unlike their homeland.
