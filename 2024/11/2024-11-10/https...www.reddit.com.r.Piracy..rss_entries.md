<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I recently stood up a Jellyfin server, and boy have I been missing out! I already had a huge stash of media, but this has given me a reason to seek out higher resolution versions off all my movies, tv shows and documentaries I&#39;ve been collecting. </p> <p>For movies and TV shows it has been easy to source 1080p and 4k versions. But, for documentaries it has been a disaster. My goal is to have at least 720p versions of all docs but let&#39;s just say it isn&#39;t going so well. I&#39;ve been in the game a while now so I know the usual spots (i.e Insert most of your fav torrent sites here ____ ). Just seems like docs get the short end of the stick -- like people stop seeding shortly.</p> <p>TLDR: Can anyone recommend where to get documentaries at at least 720p? I&#39;m talking even old things (e.g. things from ~20 years ago)?</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/jlar0che"> /u/jlar0che
