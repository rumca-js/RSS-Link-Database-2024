I am using a pi5 to watch live TV, DVDs and steaming on my 27&quot; CRT. Its the only TV I have, I&#39;m very stubborn and don&#39;t like to replace things if they still work. Anyway, here is the problem I have.</p> <p>NTSC video is 720x480, which is a 16:9 ratio, however it has non square pixels, so its actually a 4:3 ratio. Linux doesn&#39;t know this, so it outputs a standard 16:9 image with square pixels,. This creates a squashed image. My current work around in VLC, is to use a custom aspect ratio of 2:1 for 16:9 video. This works great for live TV, DVDs and other videos that i can play though VLC, but online streaming services, like amazon video and youtube, don&#39;t have this ability.</p> <p>I don&#39;t see how it would be possible, but is there a way to make xorg or wayland handle non square pixels? Or is there any other work around to make the aspect ratio correct? like a 4:3 stretched ratio(i don&#39;t think this is possible on the ", "id": 1490366, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1goarnp/pi5_composite_video_use_non_square_pixels", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 470, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Pi5 Composite Video - Use non square pixels??", "vote": 0}]
