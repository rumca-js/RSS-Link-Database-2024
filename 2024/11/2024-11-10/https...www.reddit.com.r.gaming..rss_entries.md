To be ahead of it&#39;s time, the game simply needs to introduce concepts or elements that are not imediately picked-up. It does not even need be good or remarkable - it just needs to have elements that are so new and unusual that it goes unappreciated and forgotten.

New cultures, new discoveries. I&#39;m waiting it. But Mass Effect ended, and new IPs like them did not appear. I&#39;ve been fed up fantasy for a long time, and I&#39;m not interested in old-school RPG games with lots of races, classes, and a very detailed character editor. I just want to log into the game, create a character from the presets, and go on a journey through space, learning new and unseen things, interacting with alien companions, and making decisions that change the narrative. Apparently, humanity is simply not ready for one more game like Mass Effect, and that&#39;s why no one is willing to repeat and improve their formula.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Popular-Hornet-6294"> /u/Popular-Hornet-6294

And they weren&#39;t just true, they were VERY true.</p> <p>I had bought Mass Effect Legendary Edition during the Steam Summer Sale for 6€, installed it, but didn&#39;t try it until yesterday (the same thing I do with most of my Steam games to be honest).

I see everywhere that the image is incredible, but i only see them displayed in brightly lit stores, so the différence seems minimal to me. </p> <p>I would go for a 27inch screen, its what i have now and i feel that more would be too big as i play on a desk</p> <p>What do you think ? I have the budget for it but it doesnt mean i want to uselessly waste money. For those of you that bought one, dud you regret it or cant you even imagine going back ?</p> <p>Thanks !</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Immediate-Repeat-726"> /u/Immediate-Repeat-726 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1gnwqbh/oled_screen/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1gnwqbh/oled_screen/">[comments]</a></span>

Other than that Palworld and games in the Pokemon franchise are very different.</p> <p>Nintendo has sued with the argument that Palworld infringes on their patents to this game mechanic, despite Nintendo only having filed the patents after the release of Palworld.</p> <p>As part of the lawsuit Nintendo has offered to settle the case for 10 million yen, which is about $65,000. If Pocketpair does not settle they would go to court against Nintendo.</p> <p>This would indicated that Nintendo are going to argue that a game mechanic does not need to be patented to be protected, and that infringements made before the patent was made can be persued in court.</p> <p>If Pocketpair chooses to settle the case, or if they go to court and lose, then this would set a legal precedent that could ac
