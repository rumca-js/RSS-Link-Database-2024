<p class="has-drop-cap has-text-align-none">Aaron Schimberg’s fantastical dark comedy <em>A Different Man</em> is one of 2024’s richest, strangest movies —&nbsp;a film about a man who radically changes his appearance and his life, but is haunted by the success of someone who looks just like he used to. It’s a perfect viewing companion for <em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/movies/455942/substance-director-interview-branding-design">The Substance</a></em>, another woozy, disturbing 2024 movie about a beautiful changeling battling a former version of herself. But Schimberg’s take on the tale is funnier and more down to earth, built around believable performances and a

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22766070/arcane-review-netflix-league-of-legends">Arcane</a></em>’s secret sauce has always been its soundtrack. There’s no better example of this than one of the early scenes of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22766070/arcane-review-netflix-league-of-legends">season 2</a>’s first episode, as Caitlyn mourns the death of her mother. Rather than forcing grief-stricken dialogue to communicate how she’s feeling, the show cuts to a completely unique animation style, with stylized black charcoal ske

<p class="has-text-align-none">Walmart has several waves of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/black-friday">Black Friday</a> deals coming up, the first of which begins on Nov. 11, followed by two others happening Nov. 25 and Dec. 1. You can get three hours of early access to each of those deal waves through its website and through the Walmart app — but only by being a Walmart Plus member. This will let you casually browse for the gifts that you’re after without feeling like you’re competing with shoppers to get the deals before they sell out. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If that sounds like a luxury, Walmart is offering a big 50% discount on the membership until Dec. 2, reducing the cost to <a href="h

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the risk of being entirely unrelatable: You know that music they play at the spa? That synthy, spaced-out soundscape type of stuff that isn’t exactly music, but isn’t exactly <em>not</em> music? The sort of playlist you can find if you take a wrong turn from your favorite lo-fi playlist? Chord after relaxing chord, interspersed with birdsong, rain sounds, or crackling fire? Well, <em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/europa/475607">Europa</a></em> is that, but in video game form — at least when it comes to its gameplay.</p>
