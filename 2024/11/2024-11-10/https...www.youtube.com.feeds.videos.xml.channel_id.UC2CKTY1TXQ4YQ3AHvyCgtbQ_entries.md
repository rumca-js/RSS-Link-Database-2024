It's nearing the end of the year, so that means Vince Venturella and I have released another 'zine for our game company - Snarling Badger Studios - and it's called SNARL. This year's issue has a new goblin game called The Great Goblin Argle-Bargle and also some add-ons for three of our previous games. I'll talk a little about that and of course, I'll answer your wargaming-related questions. Come have fun!
