Four years. It's been almost four years since the Xbox Series X/S launched. It almost feels like yesterday when Microsoft confirmed rumors about this magical Project Scarlett and everything it had to offer. Despite the state of the world in 2020, the pair of consoles had a pretty strong launch, especially when stacked against the PS5.

However, things have been very up and down for the Xbox Series X/S since then. Microsoft has expanded on Game Pass and Xbox Game Studios, acquiring Bethesda, and others. Hardware sales have dropped significantly over time, though, and for all the games it's revealed, Xbox is seemingly wanting more.

What does the console report card look like after all this time, and what's next for the Xbox Series X/S? Join us as we look back at the console's life cycle alongside its most defining releases (and mishaps).

As a genre, stealth has evolved massively over the last two decades. We’re now used to seeing games that build stealth mechanics into gameplay rather than being titles that are solely dedicated to the act of sneakily infiltrating, silently taking action, and evading without detection as was more commonplace in the past. 

Regardless of a game’s principal intentions, there’s still a level of measured immersion in stealth gameplay that can’t be beat, so it doesn’t necessarily matter if the game is ostensibly a stealth title or not. 

That’s the yardstick we’re using for this rundown anyway; the game’s featured here come from a broad spectrum of genres, but their commonality is an infusion of stealth-based mechanics; an incisiveness demanded of the player being the main criteria for their inclusion on this list.
