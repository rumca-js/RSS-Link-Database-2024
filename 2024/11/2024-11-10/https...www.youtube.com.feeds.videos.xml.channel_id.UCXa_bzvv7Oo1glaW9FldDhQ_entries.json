It's been almost four years since the Xbox Series X/S launched. It almost feels like yesterday when Microsoft confirmed rumors about this magical Project Scarlett and everything it had to offer. Despite the state of the world in 2020, the pair of consoles had a pretty strong launch, especially when stacked against the PS5.\n\nHowever, things have been very up and down for the Xbox Series X/S since then. Microsoft has expanded on Game Pass and Xbox Game Studios, acquiring Bethesda, and others. Hardware sales have dropped significantly over time, though, and for all the games it's revealed, Xbox is seemingly wanting more.\n\nWhat does the console report card look like after all this time, and what's next for the Xbox Series X/S?
