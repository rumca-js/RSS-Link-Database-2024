<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi Django Community!</p> <p>Following my post yesterday about finding a fellow Django dev co-founder, I was amazed by the incredible response from developers worldwide. This inspired me to propose a larger idea: What if we created a platform specifically for Django developers to collaborate on profitable projects? Like &quot;Tinder but for builders who match over an idea&quot;</p> <p>Here&#39;s the concept:</p> <p>- A free platform where specifically for Django developers ( for now) can share and browse project ideas</p> <p>- Developers can choose projects that interest them and find like-minded collaborators</p> <p>- Revenue sharing would be transparent and based on repository contributions and git commit.</p> <p>- The platform itself would be open-source, built by the community for the community</p> <p>I&#39;m looking for team members to help build this platform, specifically:</p> <p>- A technical lead/CTO with strong full-stack experience and soft

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Recently I had to fix a couple django rest-framework APIs at work that were built as part of a MVP that could not scale properly, which got me thinking of writing a tutorial about different ways of writing APIs in Django.</p> <p>I provided the dockerized examples that you can easily run, the README contains step-by-step changes I make to the API, starting with a toy example that struggles to return 100k rows in over 30 seconds, optimized down to under 1 second.</p> <p>I know some of these are controversial opinions of Django, but I thought I&#39;d share them any way, hopefully you pick up something useful. It&#39;s a work-in-progress, I plan to add comparison to a Django-ninja as well as backend written in pure Go, as I&#39;ve come to like those two as well.</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/oscarychen/building-efficient-api">https://github.com/oscarychen/building-efficient-api</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://w
