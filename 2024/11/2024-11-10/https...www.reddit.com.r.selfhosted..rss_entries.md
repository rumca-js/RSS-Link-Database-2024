I also have a separate VM for Home Assistant, plus various LXC containers for Vaultwarden, Plex, the *arrs (Sonarr, Radarr, etc.), and Immich. I know that running TrueNAS in a VM isn’t ideal, and I’m exploring options to simplify my setup.</p> <p>I’m thinking about switching to TrueNAS Scale as the primary system since the latest release supports native Docker containers. My goals are to streamline my setup and potentially <strong>remove Proxmox</strong> if it makes sense. Here are my main questions:</p> <p>• Can TrueNAS Scale effectively serve as a hypervisor for my needs, while also managing Docker containers for various apps?<br/> • How is the hardware acceleration support for Docker containers like **Plex** and **Immich**?<br/> • What are the best options for regular backups and restoring Docker containers (or apps) if things go wrong?

Do you have any best practices for such a scenario?</p> <p>One idea I have is to use one (zfs) mount point per docker container and store the docker volumes for that container there.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve tried most if not all of the self-hosted music servers recommended on reddit over the past few weeks and not a single one seems to support my use case.</p> <p>I have around 110k music files, all MP3, all tagged in ID3v2.4. The album artist is alone in the &#39;Album Artist&#39; tag and the main artist and any features are in the &#39;Artist&#39; tag, separated by semicolon - <a href="https://i.imgur.com/xOMxcd4.png">shown here in Mp3tag</a>.</p> <p>But my issue is that every server wont separate the &#39;Artist&#39; tag by semicolon and instead treats it as one long artist, for example here is the same album is shown across different servers: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/cCULTmB.png">Plex</a>, <a href="https://i.imgur.com/YEU2eQH.png">Jellyfin</a>, <a href="https://i.imgur.com/tWKKmUI.png">Navidrome</a> &amp; <a href="https://i.imgur.com/IwFc320.png">Subsonic</a>.</p> <p>If I manually edit the metadata in Jellyfin by right clicking &gt; edit

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Basically I’m having this issue where when I’m transfering files with smb, sftp or whatever… The speeds always seem to be at 1MB/s or 2MB/s.. Is there something I’m missing somewhere? </p> <p>I’m on gigabit internet btw and using ubuntu server on the server.</p> <p>This only happens when I’m on a remote connection or on a vpn that is able to do more than much more than that.</p> <p>Is there something that limits it somewhere on ubuntu or on the router?</p> <p>If anyone of you had this issue let me know how you fixed it if you were able to.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Greetings all!</p> <p>Recently had the chance to upgrade my HomeLab hardware and decided to start fresh security wise. (Previous lab used an amalgamation of open ports, bad firewalls, random VPN&#39;s and other not so secure stuff) Got to start experimenting somewhere right. Since I&#39;m a little more versed in HomeLabbing now I want to do it &#39;right&#39; from the get-go. I plan on exposing some services like websites and game servers to the world. Those services will run on VM&#39;s, no docker involved. Other, internal, services will remain internal and will only be accessible from within my LAN. The whole setup will consist of 1 proxmox server wherein everything will be virtualised.</p> <p>First I experimented with the following physical proof op concept before doing anything on my lab itself: Traffic destined for the website <a href="http://example.com:80">example.com:80</a> first hits the VPS which runs Caddy Reverse-Proxy and acts as a WireG

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have a relatively simple requirement. I have a database pertaining to suites in an apartment building. The key is the suite number. Every suite can one or more Owners, Occupants , KeyFOBS, Parking spaces, Storage lockers, Bicycle stalls, Dogs, Cats, and so on. </p> <p>Each of these is stored in a separate table, and each table has the suite number as the first column. They can each have multiple entries for each suite. The Owners table, for example, would typically have one or two rows per suite and the columns would be Suite, Name, Address, Email, Phone, etc. The Occupants table could have up to six rows per suite, with columns like Suite, Name, Age, Gender, Email, Phone, etc. </p> <p>I want to pull up a form for a suite, and be able to modify, add, or delete all the information for the suite on the same page. Owner details, Occupant details, Parking details, everything. When I save the form, the data should be written to the appropriate tables. <

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Does anyone know of an ebook server like calibre-web that supports adding an external library (e.g. Read only mount to my current library of books) and also allows SSO or sign in by matching username to a header? I thought Kavita would do both, but sadly there is no support for additional auth methods unless I missed something.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/GwimlinHowJones"> /u/GwimlinHowJones </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1gno2fi/looking_for_a_calibreweb_alternative_with_support/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1gno2fi/looking_for_a_calibreweb_alternative_with_support/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Is there anything at all that even approaches Pirate Ship functionality but open-source and self-hosted? </p> <p>A guy with a ship shop today said there&#39;s nothin. Wish I would have added this to the self-hosted wishlist post the other day!</p> <p>FWIW I bought an industrial Zebra thermal label printer the other day. Got labels to print with Linux and LibreOffice which is pretty awesome, but still a super painful process overall dealing with printers.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Losconquistadores"> /u/Losconquistadores </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1gnnwgp/zero_selfhosted_options_for_shipping_labels/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1gnnwgp/zero_selfhosted_options_for_shipping_labels/">[comments]</a></span>
