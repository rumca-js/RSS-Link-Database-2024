<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’m looking for an RSS reader compatible with iOS and Mac that saves any articles I add outside of my RSS feeds directly into the “starred” section, alongside all the other items I’ve saved for later. Currently, I’m using Reeder Classic, which has a read-it-later feature, but it requires a separate account for that, so I have to switch between accounts to find them.</p> <p>Ideally, I’d like a setup where everything I plan to read—whether it’s from my feeds or added manually—goes straight into the starred section for easy access.</p> <p>Bonus would be if it offers iCloud sync and great share sheet extension.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Ill_Connection_3017"> /u/Ill_Connection_3017 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1gnwwaq/rss_reader_that_puts_saved_links_in_the_starred/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1gnwwaq/rss_reader
