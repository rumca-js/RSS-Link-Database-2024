Well the other day I had to restart my PC, and ever since then, my script has been failing. It does not seem to be do to any security measure or anything. What is happening is when i run my code, it opens up a blank chrome page, but it does not try to navigate to my url. The search bar is just empty, and then my code ends up failing since it tries to pull specific data from the broswer, but since its not at the specified page, it cannot find what its looking for. I have looked at the nodriver github page, and it does not look like there have any any posted issues, nor has it been updated in a couple months, so I am not sure what is going on, and was hoping someone would be able to help! Pasted below is the relevant portion of my code that ends up failing.</p> <pre><code>import nodriver as uc browser = await", "id": 1486632, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1gnpxyd/nodriver_not_navigating_to_url_when_running", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 467, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Nodriver not navigating to url when running browser.get(url)", "vote": 0}]
