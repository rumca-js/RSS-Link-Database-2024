<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’m looking to get a Yubikey or similar.</p> <p>I’d use it to secure my emails, socials and similar. Personal use, not company. I’m not more of a target than anyone else but I can imagine how much it would suck if something got compromised, especially my main email that has all other accounts connected to it.</p> <p>I’d get one with Mac to carry around and use for my computer/phone. Then two others to store at places where they can’t get lost.</p> <p>Currently I mainly use Apple’s keychain.</p> <p>I’d love to hear your thoughts! Do you use it in this way? Is it a good solution or just annoying? Is uTrust good even though it’s cheap? Are there any open source alternatives? Is there something I need to think about?</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/duckbeater69"> /u/duckbeater69 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1gnscen/your_thoughts_on_hardware_mfa_yu
