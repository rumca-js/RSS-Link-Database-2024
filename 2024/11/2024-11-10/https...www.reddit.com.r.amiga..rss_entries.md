<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Currently, I have my Amiga 500 connected to an old 4:3 LCD using a SCART converter. I would really like to have something more authentic, but my search for a 1084/1084s has been fruitless. I don&#39;t want to risk damage buying one shipped (I&#39;ve already lost one CRT monitor that way), and I don&#39;t live in an area where the local FB marketplace has produced any hits. Even if I did fine one, I&#39;ve read that the failure rate of the 1000 series is pretty high.</p> <p>So my question: what does everyone else suggest for the most authentic, but not actual Commodore, display for their Amiga?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/AtomicPlayboyX"> /u/AtomicPlayboyX </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1goa0na/best_10801084_alternative_for_a500_display/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1goa0na/best_10801084_alternative_for_a500_
