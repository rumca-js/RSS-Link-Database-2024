Today I dive deep into some of MSCHF's wildest product drops, from their Big Red Boots to some questionably flavored chips that probably shouldn't exist. We unboxed everything from fake ID card packs to an AI-powered dating sim that does your taxes (yes, really), and even a device that blocks Alexa from spying on you. Fair warning: some of these products are absolutely ridiculous, but that's what MSCHF is for, right?
