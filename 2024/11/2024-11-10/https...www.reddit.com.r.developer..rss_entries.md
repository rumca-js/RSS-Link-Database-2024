<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>What should be the optimal chunk size for splitting a document (PDF mainly) while embedding it into AI?</p> <p>I tried 2 ways: </p> <ol> <li>200 chunk size and 70 overlap</li> <li>512 chunk size and 100 overlap</li> </ol> <p>My test document types are long research papers and subject notes each document ranging from 100 to 250 (maximum 300) pages</p> <p>Additional question: Is it recommended to create new indexes for each embedding or create a single index for the whole document and every embedding created from the document goes nests inside it?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/disbotable"> /u/disbotable </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1go27o3/suggestion_on_embedding_chunk_and_overlap/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1go27o3/suggestion_on_embedding_chunk_and_overlap/">[comments]</a></span>
