Efficient memory utilization is a critical aspect of software running in a multi-tenant environment, where resources are shared amongst different processes. Unlike languages with automatic memory management, C++ allows for manual memory management. Developers have control over when memory is allocated and released, which can lead to more efficient resource usage, but also can lead to mistakes causing problems in memory. 

You plugged new code in for a fancy feature and all functional tests were green! You clicked the deploy button, but 10 minutes later an alarm came -- machine memory usage had reached 90%! Things can get even more complicated when you work on a project with numerous contributors. How do you know which of the latest commits resulted in your process eating up all the memory of the OS and never releasing it back?

In this talk, I will try to put together some useful p
