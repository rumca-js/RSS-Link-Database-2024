<p>Tomorrow, we in the US celebrate Thanksgiving. So today seemed like a good time for me to recognize the people and technologies in the software development world that I’m most thankful for. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="im-thankful-for-alan-turing-and-computer-programming">I’m thankful for Alan Turing and computer programming</h3>



<p>I don’t think many folks realize the impact that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing">Alan Turing</a> had on the world. He conceived of a general-purpose computer—a machine that could do any kind of calculation based on varying algorithms and inputs. He dreamed up computer programming. That the world treated him so badly after he helped

<p>The ability to perform multiple operations simultaneously is one of the most important aspects of any programming language. Orchestrating multiple paths of execution is inherently complex and there are various approaches to taming this complexity. <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2256390/what-is-kotlin-the-java-alternative-explained.html">Kotlin</a> is a JVM language growing in popularity for its clean union of functional and object-oriented paradigms. In <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3608206/kotlin-for-java-developers-classes-and-coroutines.html">my previous article</a>, I introduced Kotlin’s coroutines as a powerful feature for handling concurrency. Now we’ll take a clo

<p>JetBrains plans to drop some scripting-related technologies from the <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2256390/what-is-kotlin-the-java-alternative-explained.html">Kotlin language</a>, including REPL functionality, an obsolete API for Java scripting, the KotlinScriptMojo Maven plugin, and the kotlin-scripting-ide-services library for implementing code completion functionality.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2024/11/state-of-kotlin-scripting-2024/">November 19 blog post</a>, JetBrains said it would drop these scripting technologies from Kotlin because its research showed that user needs were covered by other technologies already being supported.
