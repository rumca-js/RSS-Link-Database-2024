In hardware news this week, we cover a number of rumors and leaks about video cards (like Intel's upcoming Battlemage B580 and NVIDIA's RTX 5090 and 5080 series). We also talk about news in the fabrication world, with TSMC limited on international manufacturing and Intel getting CHIPS funding -- but with a discount, and not in their favor. Other rumors include discussion of a Sony Handheld. Lots of rumors this week as the industry winds-down for Thanksgiving in the US!
