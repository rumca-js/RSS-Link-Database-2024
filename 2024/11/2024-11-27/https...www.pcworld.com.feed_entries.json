While most monitors are fairly simple to set up, if you want to personalize your monitor further, you\u2019ll need a few extra addons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m talking about things like a surge protector, screen cleaning kit, and USB hub. Getting the right cable for your monitor (HDMI or DisplayPort 1.4) is a big consideration too. A monitor arm is a worthwhile investment as well \u2014 it\u2019s going to let you view your monitor at exactly the angle you want so that you don\u2019t have to strain your neck. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You could buy these things later on or snap them up now, while they are top of mind, and while some or all of them are discounted for the holidays. If you decide to snap up a bargain, here\u2019s a list of the top 10 items to go for.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"essent",

I\u2019m trying to hold out for another year, but it\u2019s not easy with bigger and bigger discounts coming in every day. Take this 49-inch MSI OLED ultrawide, for example: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/MSI-MPG-491CQP-QD-OLED-response/dp/B0CTRXCNV8/\">it\u2019s just $799.99 on Amazon</a>, a solid THOUSAND BUCKS less than some other 49-inch OLEDs. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The MPG 491CQP is a dual-QHD design, probably using the same 49-inch, 5120\u00d71440 panel as <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/2374348/49-inch-oled-gaming-monitor-hits-a-new-low-at-900.html\">Gigabyte\u2019s alternative</a>.
