Everyone enjoys those and I&#39;m sure people would love to find some others to play. My pick for the unique fps genre is Powerslave(Exhumed). Set in Egypt, you have to fight off a pending invasion. Super interesting with puzzles and some light Metroid esque backtracking. Highly recommend it if you get a chance to play. What about y&#39;all? What&#39;s the unique fps you love to play?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/migraine
