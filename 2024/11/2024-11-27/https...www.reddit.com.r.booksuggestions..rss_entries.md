<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all, I typically read historical WW2, but I&#39;m looking to take it back some &amp; want something from pre-industrial Ireland. I watched Brave with my daughter and want the adult version. Alternatively, same time period but from England, Germany, Viking-esque. Fiction is fine, but NF is preferred. Thanks!</p> <p>ETA: I&#39;ve read the Last Kingdom &amp; loves it.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi. I have been developing a particular hyperfixation on the Y2K Bug/Millenium Bug/Year 2000 Problem, namely the technological, historical and cultural responses pertaining to and surrounding it. I would very much like to find a good non-fiction book about these aspects of the Y2K Bug, perhaps covering the relevant history in relation to it.</p> <p>I&#39;ve tried looking online but I&#39;ve only thus far been able to find books published within a few years prior to 2000, which promoted incredibly sensationalised survivalist conspiracy theory stuff about the alleged impact and impending doomsday due to the problem. I will admit those are interesting in their own right (and probably quite funny retrospectively for obvious reasons, lol) but I would really love to find a non-fiction book written after 2000 on the topic if there are any, perhaps.</p> <p>Thanks. :) </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/aban

I remember loving magical books (Harry Potter, The Magic Half). Also immature gossipy/drama books (We Are So Crashing Your Bat Mitzvah, Dork Diaries, Uglies Series).

Are they really that affective?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>My niece is 8 and a very advanced reader (hence the title). She’s probably at a middle school level. Pretty sure she finishes 10+ books a week. I am having trouble coming up with a series she could read that would challenge her ability without having too grown up of themes AND that she hasn’t read yet. I say series because she will devour it like it’s a single novel. That said, if there’s a stand alone book that comes highly recommended, I’d get it for her! If there was something that was STEM based that would be great, but she’s very into fantasy, so those kinds of suggestions would be wonderful, too.

She is just finishing a cancer treatment and has had a pretty bad life since my dad left (pre cancer) and she has become a bit of a recluse and sometimes just not a very nice person to be around. She has also been an alcoholic for as long as I can remember and is not willing to take the first steps herself so I can’t really help there. I was wondering if anyone knew of any books that would motivate her to do more with life and that it’s not all bad and just a bit of self help but without it being obviously ‘self help’ if that makes sense? Like a fictional story that would make her go ‘okay yeah that’s opened up something positive in me’ but it’s not sold as such.

I really enjoyed the Harry Potter series for its pacing as well as the ability to escape the world a bit.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Can anyone recommend any books (fiction) about morally grey vigilantes (or even secret societies!) who have a strong, sibling-like bond? I&#39;ve been blissfully lost in the world of Asian literature for the last few years, and have found myself drawn to the character dynamics in wuxia, murim, and yakuza stories, however when I&#39;ve tried to find those sort of dynamics outside of those kinds of stories, I&#39;ve often come up empty-handed. I got curious, and thought I&#39;d ask reddit for help :)</p> <p>(Side note: I&#39;ve tried both Six of Crows and Jade City and I adore them both, and also tried Lies of Locke Lamora and found it somewhat depressing lol, not sure if that helps or not, but I thought it might.)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/WhovianKindlyViking"> /u/WhovianKindlyViking </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1h0t4ss/stories_about_a_morally_g

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>VERY PRETENTIOUS TITLE I KNOW</p> <p>Sorry about that!! I just don’t know how else to describe it. </p> <p>I read The Grapes of Wrath in highschool and got to listen to my then nearly retirement age british teacher read certain chapters to us, and it was an experience. (Nearly fell asleep at my desk just listening to him a few times because it was so soothing.) It made me really appreciate the language used and how different older books are from modern ones. </p> <p>I also really like Dracula and am slowly working through it. </p> <p>I might just be used to YA slop but I feel like a lot of modern books just don’t have that <em>pizzaz</em> that I’m looking for. The imagery in Dracula makes me stop and take a picture of the paragraph I’m reading so I can show my boyfriend every few pages. </p> <p>If it’s something I can imagine an old british gentleman in a cold classroom reading aloud, then I want it. That man has great taste in books. </p> <p>This sa

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all! I’m (27F) an avid reader of all the popular booktok recommendations like ACOTAR, Assassins Blade, The Kindred series, Blood and Ash, just to name a few. Obviously I love the romance adventure with a lil smutty action, but I know my mother in law does not like romance novels. She said “anything but romance”. She’s 60ish, and I have no idea if the types of books I read would even satisfy her generation or if I need to find something that caters to her. The closest book in my library I can think to recommend is The Priory of the Orange Tree. If I can’t think of something else, I’ll just roll with that. Any ideas? She said she only wants books for Christmas 😬</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Delicious-Sir-6144"> /u/Delicious-Sir-6144 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1h0sb2r/books_for_motherinlaw/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.red

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone!</p> <p>As the title suggests I am looking for a book that showcases a dead or dying world and how the main character navigates it, I am a big fan of the atmosphere of things like the dark souls series and nier automata (video games just are easy to come to mind). I read a lot for my work but over the Christmas holidays I would like a book to cozy up with, any recommendations are welcome! Due to the nature of the topic I am not opposed to super sad or mournful books, in fact I would prefer a more somber read.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Spackal2"> /u/Spackal2 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1h0s3t5/looking_for_a_book_about_a_dead_world/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1h0s3t5/looking_for_a_book_about_a_dead_world/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I like Matt Haigs books (midnight library and others of his), time travel (although not all are done well so that may be too vague), the Night Circus and Starless sea (EM). Loved 11/22/63 (SK) if there are others like that. Happy shows like Ted Lasso w humor if that can translate into a book. Allie Brosch but that is kindof a different read with the artwork but i hope she does another. Lizard music by Pinkwater was my favorite as a kid. Any suggestions? Know this is a bit all over the map.
