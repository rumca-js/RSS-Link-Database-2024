<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I decided to save an old Samsung CLX-3185 from e-waste by using a spare Pi Zero W to make a print server. It’s a combination of CUPS, printer-driver-foo2zjs (for the drivers), and Samba. </p> <p>I have it all working but performance is bad with print jobs often taking over a minute before the printer starts responding when it is much faster over a direct USB connection.</p> <p>I don’t know if this is down to using Samba as an intermediate layer, if there is something I can optimize with CUPS (so much of the documentation I found is woefully out of date), if it’s that the PI Zero is underpowered for this task, or something else. </p> <p>I’ve been trying to take Samba out of the equation and get IPP printing working (and hopefully my mobile devices will then be able to use the printer). But the aforementioned out of date documentation has been an issue (much referring cupsd.conf parameters that are no longer supported).</p> <p>But if anyone else has be

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;d appreciate it if the mods didn&#39;t reflexively take this down with the claim that the problem is voltage or a bad SD card. It&#39;s neither. I spent over a week tracking this down and I think it&#39;s important that people know there&#39;s an actual issue.</p> <p>tl;dr: I can cause a hard freeze on my Raspberry pi 4 (and it happened on both my Raspberrypi 5&#39;s as well) by hooking a cheap USB camera into a powered USB hub, and writing a few lines of code to periodically open the device, and do a quick series of reads on it to collect the raw image data. It doesn&#39;t lock up the device on the first try, but if I do that every couple of minutes, the board will freeze hard, not respond to any inputs, and need to be power cycled, within 24 hours - sometimes within seconds. Unplug the camera or disable the code and it does not freeze.</p> <p>It&#39;s an up to date copy of Bookworm. It doesn&#39;t come close to using all available memory, it&

The GPS struggles to lock onto satellites—ideally, I need 8, but I only get 4-5 even with shielding.</p> <p>So far, I’ve tried putting the Pi in a polystyrene box covered with aluminum foil and distancing the GPS module, but it’s not enough.</p> <p>Any tips to reduce interference or improve satellite lock? It’s for transmitting photos, and GPS data in the images would be very helpful.</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/GianlucaBelgrado"> /u/GianlucaBelgrado </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1h0rbpi/problem_with_gps_and_pi_zero/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1h0rbpi/problem_with_gps_and_pi_zero/">[comments]</a></span>
