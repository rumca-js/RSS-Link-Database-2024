My favourite genre has always been fantasy and he&#39;s requested a book or two for Christmas to help him start in the genre. He has tried on his own but says that he struggles with learning the rules and politics of this whole new world.</p> <p>I&#39;ve already decided to give him Percy Jackson since he loves the show and has a good understanding of Greek Mythology, but I want to get him another book that is more adult themed. I had considered Skyborn by David Daglish, but it&#39;s been a few years since I&#39;ve read that series and I don&#39;t remember how gently he eases you in to the intricacies of the world, but I think my brother would love the story. </p> <p>Any thoughts or suggestions would be appreciated! I&#39;m particularly struggling to think of ideas as I&#39;ve loved convoluted magic systems and political fantasies for as long as I can re",

I mention that because a lot of the advice on this sort of thing tends to center around burn out, but this isn\u2019t that because I\u2019ve never been a reader in the first place. I need help building the stamina to read for the first time. </p> <p>I have this tendency to read about 100 pages of a book, and then just completely drop it. I don\u2019t get bored of the book or the story or anything specific about the book itself. In fact, the last two times this has happened, couple months ago with Pet Sematary and right now with The Hobbit, I\u2019m really really enjoying the book itself, but I\u2019m finding it hard to pick up again. I\u2019ve been doing a chapter-ish a day with The Hobbit, and it\u2019s been really nice to read, but the last two days have gotten harder. This is really confusing to me because the chapter I just finished last night was pretty easily the best of the boo",

By this, I mean stories that embrace the bleakness and realism of traditional dark fantasy while interspersing elements of humor, irony, or wit. These touches create a balance that makes the narrative both engaging and emotionally nuanced.</p> <p>I enjoy books with a multifaceted tone, where grim events are contrasted with moments of absurdity, character-driven humor, or sharp dialogue. I\u2019m looking for something that subverts the typically heavy atmosphere of the genre\u2014not by parodying it, but by acknowledging its seriousness while skillfully incorporating moments of levity and humanity.</p> <p>Bonus points for good prose that enhances the story\u2019s tone and immerses the reader in its world.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Chebbou\"> /u/Chebbou </a> <br/> <span><a href",
