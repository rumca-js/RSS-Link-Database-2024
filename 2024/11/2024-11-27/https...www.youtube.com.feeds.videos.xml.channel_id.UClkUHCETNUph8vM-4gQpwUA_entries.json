        "description": "Yasha Legends Of The Demon Blade Gameplay \u2013 An Indie Roguelike RPG That Should be On Your Radar\nI recently got the chance to play Yasha: Legends Of The Demon Blade. I remember seeing the title when I went to Gamescom a few months ago and I tried to drop by their booth back then, but the booth was packed at the time so I didn\u2019t get a chance to play. Fast forward to last week when I saw a demo of the game available on Steam, I just knew that I had to try it out. So in this article, we\u2019ll be talking about Yasha: Legends Of The Demon Blade, an ARPG game with roguelike mechanics that is being developed by 7QUARK, an indie gaming studio from Taiwan. The game will be released in Q1 of 2025 and so far Steam is the only platform that is confirmed.\n\nTimestamps\n0:00 - Yasha Legends of the Demon Blade Preview\n0:27 - What Is Yasha Legends of the Demon Blade\n1:10 - Gameplay\n3:04 - Shigure The Immortal Ninja\n5:06 - Sara The Oni Emissary\n6:55 - Taketora The Demon Samurai\n8:52 - Final Thoughts\n\nDon't",
