The feature set is actually pretty good (E2E encrypted, A/V calls, message reactions/replies, media send). However, reliability has been a bit spotty sometimes: A/V calls sometimes don&#39;t connect (though I wonder if it&#39;s something with my turn settings) and messages sometimes get stuck for a while after quickly backgrounding the Android app. This is with the legacy Element app since Element X isn&#39;t at feature parity yet. We primarily use the Android apps and the MacOS desktop app.</p> <p>I recently tried out XMPP since I&#39;ve read some people say XMPP is better than Matrix/Element. The Android Conversations app is quite good but every desktop/web solution was did not interop well.

Recently I decided to finish the email server configuration by adding SPF, DKIM and DMARC because if I&#39;m doing something I might as well do it properly.</p> <p>I&#39;m using <a href=\"https://www.mail-tester.com\">https://www.mail-tester.com</a> to check my configuration and this is my SpamAssassin score:</p> <pre><code>-0.1 DKIM_SIGNED Message has a DKIM or DK signature, not necessarily valid This rule is automatically applied if your email contains a DKIM signature but other positive rules will also be added if your DKIM signature is valid. See immediately below. 0.1 DKIM_VALID Message has at least one valid DKIM or DK signature Great! Your signature is valid 0.1 DKIM_VALID_AU Message has a valid DKIM or DK signature from author&#39;s domain Great! Your signature is valid and it&#39;s coming fro",

I\u2019ve tried <a href=\"https://github.com/tgbot-collection/ytdlbot\">ytdlbot</a>, and it works to some extent, but there\u2019s major issue: when downloading from Instagram, it uses the VP9 codec, which causes the video to not play in Telegram on mobile (at least on iOS and macOS) and also makes it impossible to download to the gallery.
