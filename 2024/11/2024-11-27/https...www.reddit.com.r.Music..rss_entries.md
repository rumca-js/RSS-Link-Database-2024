Probably the most miserable ive been listening to music.</p> <p>maybe all the times hearing it on the radio caught up to me or something.</p> <p>so…sorry for the rant.

Pete so I feel like I should have a lot of options being that this county almost has a million ppl in it. But how do I find these?? </p> <p>Ngl Im pretty lonely being pretty new to this area too, I don&#39;t really have ppl to hang with or things to do on my days off.

If you guys don’t recognize the name, you might have heard him sing on a few Queens of the Stone Age records. He started out in an early Grunge band called Screaming Trees but it was his solo records where I think his true brilliance lay. He wrote a really intense, harrowing autobiography before he passed that’s a fascinating read. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/EvilWhiteDude"> /u/EvilWhiteDude </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1h0tsar/i_miss_mark_lanegan/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1h0tsar/i_miss_mark_lanegan/">[comments]</a></span>
