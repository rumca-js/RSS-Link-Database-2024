Step aside Wish, games workshop and Temu because today we're getting the Warhammer scams straight from the danish steps and Army Painter. Will Army Painter deliver or will they forever be labeled as scam artists? 

We don't actually think any one of these products from Army Painter or Games Workshop are real scams, we're just calling them that for fun!
