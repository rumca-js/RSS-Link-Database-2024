## Maeda saves point for Celtic against Club Brugge after Carter-Vickers error

<p>There were spells in this game when it looked a question of how many Club Brugge fancied winning by. As Cameron Carter-Vickers stroked home an embarrassing own goal to send the Belgians in front, Celtic were in a state of panic. The stars were in stripes.</p><p>Celtic have no cause to care that they snatched a point. Indeed, Brugge’s profligacy should be of no concern whatsoever to Brendan Rodgers. This draw, earned courtesy of Daizen Maeda’s glorious strike, leaves Celtic on course to reach the playoff round of the Champions League. This was an outcome which proved the beauty of football; Brugge’s style and swagger were ultimately matched by Celtic’s desire not to lose. No wonder Rodgers cut a contended figure afterwards, even if his claim that Celtic were the better second-half team was highly dubious. Eight points from five outings is a strong return.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/27/celtic-club-brugge-champions-league-match-report">Continue reading

It is 100 years this Friday since Puccini died, but he does more of the Covent Garden box office’s heavy lifting than ever. Tosca, La Bohème and Turandot are all slated for runs this season.</p><p>A revival like this one tells you why. With the three principal roles strongly cast, and the orchestra in buoyant form, only the hardest of critical hearts can resist. Yes, Tosca is a crude and melodramatic opera. And, no, the third act does not quite measure up to the first two. But Puccini’s musical ambition and his theatrical punch are masterly.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/nov/27/puccini-tosca-review-royal-opera-ho

<p>The Scream star shows impressive range in this horror-comedy, where the real peril she faces comes from a much more ordinary man</p><p>Women falling for monsters of one sort or another is hardly a new concept, whether it’s Buffy swooning over brooding vampires, Belle getting tingly feelings for the Beast, or Oscar-winning woman and fish-man fable The Shape of Water. It doesn’t always work out very well: witness Geena Davis’s journalist in The Fly, pregnant with a human-insect hybrid, with her erstwhile lover imploring her to carry their baby to term. But at the cheerier end of the spectrum we find this indie horror-comedy starring Melissa Barrera as Laura, a young lady who finds herself unexpectedly enamoured of the hairier part of the dating pool.</p><p>The monster in question (played with relish by Tommy Dewey) is in fact far less monstrous than the other man in Laura’s life; this is Jacob (a highly plausible Edmund Donovan), who dumps her while she’s undergoing treatment for ca

<p>Murakami revisits a hypnotic city of dreams, in material he’s been working on for four decades</p><p>The elegiac quality of Haruki Murakami’s new novel, his first in six years, was perhaps inevitable considering&nbsp;its origins. The City and Its Uncertain Walls began as an attempt to rework a 1980 story&nbsp;of the same title, originally published in the Japanese magazine Bungakukai, which Murakami, unsatisfied, never allowed to be republished or translated.</p><p>“I felt that this work contained something vital for me,” Murakami writes in the novel’s afterword, “at the time, though, unfortunately I lacked the skills to convey what that <em>something </em>was.” Five years later, his first attempt at a revision developed into the novel Hard‑Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World, a narrative that ran “parallel” to the original – “like two crews digging a tunnel, one from each end, breaking through and meeting up in the exact middle”. Yet still, Murakami writes, the story “both

<p>Fascinating documentary about Margaret Moth, whose footage from war zones almost killed her in 1992, lives up to her motto  ‘don’t be boring’</p><p>When TV news camerawoman Margaret Moth was shot through the face by a Serbian sniper in Sarajevo in 1992, her CNN colleagues were told that it was touch and go. One medic said that her face was so badly injured it might be better if she died. But not only did Moth survive, she went back to the frontline. “She didn’t do less war after she was shot,” remembers one colleague and friend. “She did more.” This documentary about her life, directed by the actor Lucy Lawless, is a fascinating portrait of a woman who had two mottoes: “no regrets” and “don’t be boring”.</p><p>With her jet-black hair, thick black eyeliner and army combat boots (which she slept in on the job) Moth looked more like a punk singer than a camera operator. Born and raised in New Zealand, she officially changed her name from Margaret Wilson to Margaret Moth in her 20s an

<p>When a classmate said she’d be allowed a brother or sister, I realised what it meant: she might die young. It was a sudden insight into tragedy and trauma</p><p>One afternoon in the spring of 1997, as my seven-year-old classmate and I played in a tiny park in our Shanghai neighbourhood, she shared a secret: “I’m allowed to have a little brother or sister.” My jaw dropped. No one my age had a sibling except a pair of twins at school. People used the words “sister” and “brother” to mean cousin. Having siblings was an outlandish, outdated, even shameful concept, something older generations had done before the one-child policy was introduced in 1980.</p><p>My parents carefully stored our One Child Honorary Certificate, with golden characters on a sleek red booklet, in a bottom drawer, right by my birth certificate.
