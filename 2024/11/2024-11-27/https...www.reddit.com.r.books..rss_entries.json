There are very few serious historians that make this claim. There are a few reasons that people arrive at this conclusion, the most serious of which is that the philosophy of the Prince clashes with his other writing like the Discourses. In the Prince Machiavelli writes a handbook for authoritarian nobles to gain and maintain power, while all his other writings indicate that he&#39;s a staunch republican. However, Machiavelli is a realist, democracy was a far-fetched dream in renaissance Italy, He prioritized stability and reunification above all else. </p> <p>\u201cHow we live is so different from how we ought to live that he who studies what ought to be done rather than what is done will learn the way to his downfall.\u201d</p> <p>I can&#39;t help but feel that a lot of these claim arise from an inner desire to deny the rea",

It wasn\u2019t so much an ethical dilemma in my view, WELL at least not in the Quranic version, where Abraham asks Ishmael for consent, and Ishmael accepts. While still unsettling, this portrayal felt less harrowing to me than the biblical account. My deeper concern, however, lay in the tension between human judgment and blind faith. Little did I know how unprepared for what Kierkegaard had to say.</p> <p>Faith, Kierkegaard argued, is fundamentally irrational <strong>a leap into the absurd</strong>. That idea terrified me. How can one immerse oneself in faith if there\u2019s no clear path to what to believe? And how can one discern what to believe in without reason? His vision of faith, unmoored from rationality, left me deeply unsettled. Even more chilling was the realization that faith, when wielded by brilliant minds, can justify unspea",

I think this is mostly wrong. The main function of an interview is to provide readers with an extended experience of the novel. That is, we go find an interview with the author after we&#39;ve finished their novel and we want to spend more time with it.</p> <p>In other words, we don&#39;t need an overview of the plot.
