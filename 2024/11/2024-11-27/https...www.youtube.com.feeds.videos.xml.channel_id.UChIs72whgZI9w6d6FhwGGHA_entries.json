We also talk about news in the fabrication world, with TSMC limited on international manufacturing and Intel getting CHIPS funding -- but with a discount, and not in their favor. Other rumors include discussion of a Sony Handheld. Lots of rumors this week as the industry winds-down for Thanksgiving in the US!\n\nThe best way to support our work is through our store: https://store.gamersnexus.net/\n\nLike our content?
