<p>John Siracusa, in his inimitable style, reviewed Delicious Library 1.0 upon its release, 20 years ago this month:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Part of what makes the Mac community so special is that so many
Mac developers have itches — and, more importantly, corresponding
<em>talents</em> — that have little or nothing to do with computers. I
invite you to look again at some of the screenshots and artwork in
this application. Someone loved those graphics. Someone sweated
over every pixel of that application window. Someone knows what it
means to be a lover of art, music, books, video games. This is <em>in

<p>All of these human facilities and experiences have been harnessed
to create not just a mere “program”, “application” or (God forbid)

nobody accidentally buys a non-functional app.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The end of an era, but it’s kind of surprising it was still functional until now. (<a href="https://mastodon.social/@wjs/113539330521476328">Shipley has been a full-time engineer at Apple</a> for three years now.)</p>

<p>It’s hard to describe just what a sensation Delicious Library was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130429014759/http://www.wired.com/gadgets/mac/news/2005/01/66276">when it debuted</a>, and <a href="https://weblog.rogueamoeba.com/2006/11/06/the-delicious-generation/">how influential it was</a>. Delicious Library was simultaneously very useful, in very practical ways, and obs
