Large language models, a type of AI that analyses text, can predict the results of proposed neuroscience studies more accurately than human experts, finds a new study. The findings demonstrate that large language models (LLMs) trained on vast datasets of text can distil patterns from scientific literature, enabling them to forecast scientific outcomes with superhuman accuracy. The researchers say this highlights their potential as powerful tools for accelerating research, going far beyond just knowledge retrieval.

## 'Alzheimer's in dish' model shows promise for accelerating drug discovery

A decade ago, researchers introduced a new model for studying Alzheimer's disease. Known as 'Alzheimer's in a dish,' the model uses cultures of mature brain cells suspended in a gel to recapitulate what takes place in the human brain over 10 to 13 years in just six weeks. But does the model truly produce the same changes that take place in patients? In a new study, researchers created an algorithm to assess, in an unbiased manner, how well models of Alzheimer's disease mimic the function and gene expression patterns seen in patients' brains. Their results identify crucial shared pathways, confirming that the Alzheimer's in a dish model can be used to assess new drugs accurately and rapidly as well as point the way to drug discovery.

## Researchers redefine what it means for a cell to be alive or dead

Cellular death is a fundamental concept in the biological sciences. Given its significance though, its definition depends on the context in which it takes place, and lacks a general mathematical definition. Researchers propose a new mathematical definition of death based on whether a potentially dead cell can return to a predefined 'representative state of living,' which are the states of being that we can confidently call 'alive.' The researchers' work could be useful for biological researchers and future medical research.
