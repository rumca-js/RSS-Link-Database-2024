<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi I&#39;m looking for some book recommendations as someone who is maybe not the strongest reader and needs something on the easier side to read, if that makes sense. </p> <p>I&#39;ve just finished Fourth Wing and (controversy aside) that met my speed for uncomplicated story/writing, but a very interesting fantasy world and worldbuilding. </p> <p>However I don&#39;t really care for the &quot;spice&quot; elements and while I&#39;m not averse to romance it&#39;s definitely not what I&#39;m looking for in a book? But it&#39;s becoming hard for me to find a fantasy/dystopia/scifi book that is both aimed at YA/NA and an easier read, without being overly strong on the romance. </p> <p>The Hunger Games is an excellent example of what vibe I&#39;m after. Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy also comes to mind as a non YA book that&#39;s still easy and comfortable for me to read. </p> <p>Please let me know if anyone has any recommendations!! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a fan of Django Wrexler, I loved the <em>Shadow Campaigns</em> and <em>Burningblade &amp; Silvereye</em> series was pretty good as well, so I was excited when I heard he had a new book. <em>How to Become the Dark Lord and Die Trying</em> is basically <em>Edge of Tomorrow</em> in a fantasy setting, the protagonist has been sent to save the Kingdom from the Dark Lord and every time she dies she is reborn in the same place and has to start all over again. After reliving the same life and dying hundreds of times, she decides instead of saving the Kingdom, she will become the Dark Lord herself. The book is a comedy with a lot of mockery of tropes.</p> <p>This is a fantastic premise but I disliked the book almost from the first page. The main character, who narrates the book in the first person, is incredibly annoying and obnoxious. Despite living in this fantasy world for the equivalent of a thousand years, she sounds like someone who spends all d

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Without getting into spoilers, I think part of the reason so many people have difficulty getting into the novels after the games (especially Witcher 3) is because of the massive, massive tonal dissonance between the two. </p> <p>The Witcher games are essentially &quot;fix fiction&quot; that attempts to make things far more uplifting. In the games, Geralt and Triss/Yennefer (already a big change because if you know, you know) are big epic people of importance who change the course of destiny and achieve multiple heroic things. They fight hordes of monsters and effect the course of destiny while Ciri is set up to save the world from the Big Bad. It is classic epic fantasy.</p> <p>That is...not the Witcher novels.</p> <p>The Witcher novels are about how Epic Fantasy is not real. All the monsters in the world are more or less extinct and there&#39;s no point in Witchers. A single individual hero cannot change the course of wars or affect politics in a me

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all- I am very new to reading fantasy. I just plowed through the two books in the Kingkiller chronicles. They captured my attention well and were just a great entertaining story. As someone without much experience, I would love some recommendations of where to go from here? P.s. I know all the drama etc. surrounding Rothfuss… I’m ignoring al of that and simply looking for other entertaining books.</p> <p>Thank you!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Ftcwarrior"> /u/Ftcwarrior </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1h0t6ba/book_recommendation_please_like_kingkiller/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1h0t6ba/book_recommendation_please_like_kingkiller/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey all! My younger brother (24) has been getting into reading more after hating it during school. My favourite genre has always been fantasy and he&#39;s requested a book or two for Christmas to help him start in the genre. He has tried on his own but says that he struggles with learning the rules and politics of this whole new world.</p> <p>I&#39;ve already decided to give him Percy Jackson since he loves the show and has a good understanding of Greek Mythology, but I want to get him another book that is more adult themed. I had considered Skyborn by David Daglish, but it&#39;s been a few years since I&#39;ve read that series and I don&#39;t remember how gently he eases you in to the intricacies of the world, but I think my brother would love the story. </p> <p>Any thoughts or suggestions would be appreciated! I&#39;m particularly struggling to think of ideas as I&#39;ve loved convoluted magic systems and political fantasies for as long as I can re

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey all, very new reader here. I’m trying to get into reading after growing up a complete non-reader. I mention that because a lot of the advice on this sort of thing tends to center around burn out, but this isn’t that because I’ve never been a reader in the first place. I need help building the stamina to read for the first time. </p> <p>I have this tendency to read about 100 pages of a book, and then just completely drop it. I don’t get bored of the book or the story or anything specific about the book itself. In fact, the last two times this has happened, couple months ago with Pet Sematary and right now with The Hobbit, I’m really really enjoying the book itself, but I’m finding it hard to pick up again. I’ve been doing a chapter-ish a day with The Hobbit, and it’s been really nice to read, but the last two days have gotten harder. This is really confusing to me because the chapter I just finished last night was pretty easily the best of the boo

## Looking for Recommendations: “Light-Edged Dark Fantasy” Novels

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Do you have any recommendations for what I call “<strong>Dual-Tone Fantasy</strong>” or “<strong>Light-Edged Dark Fantasy</strong>”? By this, I mean stories that embrace the bleakness and realism of traditional dark fantasy while interspersing elements of humor, irony, or wit. These touches create a balance that makes the narrative both engaging and emotionally nuanced.</p> <p>I enjoy books with a multifaceted tone, where grim events are contrasted with moments of absurdity, character-driven humor, or sharp dialogue. I’m looking for something that subverts the typically heavy atmosphere of the genre—not by parodying it, but by acknowledging its seriousness while skillfully incorporating moments of levity and humanity.</p> <p>Bonus points for good prose that enhances the story’s tone and immerses the reader in its world.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Chebbou"> /u/Chebbou </a> <br/> <span><a href
