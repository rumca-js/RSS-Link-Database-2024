The games I collect and play are games that show off how two or three beautiful, pristine cogs fit together. This one has trick taking and busting, and is the purest form of both.

How long does it play at 2? How cutthroat is the game at 2? Are there any OP cards or milestones that should be removed for 2 players? </p> <p>We are also interested to just play the introductory game (without the milestones, $75/player in the bank, no salaries) so the same questions above apply to this version.

What combination do you usually use? </p> <p>Do any of you have any homebrewed rules you use to buff The Big Rig and The Final 5, or do you just keep the expansions separated?</p> <p>Hope

Just something about that doesn&#39;t sit well with me. Entirely my issue with the game and certainly not an objective criticism. I really find Arc&#39;s system of having no reasonable/fair defence to protect your cards and resources. It&#39;s not a game I want to play again.</p> <p>So because of this, I am perturbed that Oath plays out in a similar vain of vicious and unscathed undoing of your actions and so little progress is ever made because actions are just going to get blown up.</p> <p>I&#39;m lead to believe that it&#39;s recommended you play the

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am am designing a board game and struggling with the troop design aspect. Here are the requirements:</p> <p>- the board must be visible (there are different environments/resources)</p> <p>- Players need a way to indicate that they own a tile</p> <p>- Troops need to be placed on the board, in various amounts (1,5,10), and must indicate which player they are owned by.</p> <p>- Different players troops must be able to go on tiles owned by them, other players, or no one. Troops of multiple players must be able to fit on the same tile.</p> <p>I need a way to limit the height of troop stacks (stacks are to limit the area of the board that they cover) OR a way to make the troops stick to the board so they can&#39;t fall easily. Any and all help is appreciated. Please tell me names of games with troop placement and/or ownership mechanics.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/_xXporBaccountXx_"> /u/_xXporBac
