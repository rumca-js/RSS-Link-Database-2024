Whatever comes next in the Democratic party has to be insurrectionist against the top levels of the party. Ben discusses how Democrats will need an outsider to run in 2028 if they want success. Meanwhile, Harris is telling advisors and allies to keep her political options open, because they may have to return to Kamala as a front-runner. In International news, Ben talks about NATO‚Äôs military chief calling on business leaders to prepare for what he calls ‚Äúa wartime scenario.‚Äù The UK and France are picking up the slack in Ukraine with talks to send troops to deter Putin and the Israeli Prime Minister announced they‚Äôre holding a security cabinet meeting to discuss the possibility of a 60-day cease-fire with Hezbollah.
