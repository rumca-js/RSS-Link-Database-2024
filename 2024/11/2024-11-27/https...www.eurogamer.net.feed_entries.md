Following last week's report Valve is working on a new iteration of its brilliant (if divisive) Steam Controller, a fresh leak has offered what might well be a first look at its refreshed design - and it's probably not a complete surprise to see it taking plenty of cues from Steam Deck.

Just saying these words out loud immediately conjures an image of a place with warm, hushed lighting spooling out of glazed windows, with billows of steam and smoke misting over the landscape. It's certainly an evocative kind of opening, but 30 Birds goes one better, placing its detective heroine Zig on a train careering through space on tracks made of clouds, heading toward a city made of actual paper lanterns. It's a dreamy and impossible kind of architecture, its inhabitants shifting up and down each lantern's colourful panels and wrapping their 2D bodies around the edges of a very real, 3D space, with doorways transporting them to other miniature lamp spaces hanging around its periphery.

The original PS5 release had its limitations though, with limited RT deployment and VR relying on asychronous time warp to the detriment of motion clarity. With the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a>, there's clearly plenty of potential to deploy the extra horsepower, RT acceleration and PSSR in new and interesting ways. Happily, developer Polyphony Digital has implemented basically everything on our wish list and more in one of the best PS5 Pro patches we've seen yet. Buckle up, this is going to be good!</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-gran-turismo-7-on-ps5-pro-
