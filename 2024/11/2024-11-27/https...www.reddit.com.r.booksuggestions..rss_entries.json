The trouble I am having is actually choosing the books for her to read. She is just finishing a cancer treatment and has had a pretty bad life since my dad left (pre cancer) and she has become a bit of a recluse and sometimes just not a very nice person to be around. She has also been an alcoholic for as long as I can remember and is not willing to take the first steps herself so I can\u2019t really help there. I was wondering if anyone knew of any books that would motivate her to do more with life and that it\u2019s not all bad and just a bit of self help but without it being obviously \u2018self help\u2019 if that makes sense? Like a fictional story that would make her go \u2018okay yeah that\u2019s opened up something positive in me\u2019 but it\u2019s not sold as such.

Amusing and somewhat fantastical stories like that are what I\u2019m looking for.

Or a collection of short stories about love, or the greatest love stories of all time. Or even a classic/canonical book that focuses on love/marriage (and importantly, has a happy ending!).

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi everyone!</p> <p>As the title suggests I am looking for a book that showcases a dead or dying world and how the main character navigates it, I am a big fan of the atmosphere of things like the dark souls series and nier automata (video games just are easy to come to mind). I read a lot for my work but over the Christmas holidays I would like a book to cozy up with, any recommendations are welcome! Due to the nature of the topic I am not opposed to super sad or mournful books, in fact I would prefer a more somber read.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Spackal2\"> /u/Spackal2 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1h0s3t5/looking_for_a_book_about_a_dead_world/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1h0s3t5/looking_for_a_book_about_a_dead_world/\">[comments]</a></span>",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I like Matt Haigs books (midnight library and others of his), time travel (although not all are done well so that may be too vague), the Night Circus and Starless sea (EM). Loved 11/22/63 (SK) if there are others like that. Happy shows like Ted Lasso w humor if that can translate into a book. Allie Brosch but that is kindof a different read with the artwork but i hope she does another. Lizard music by Pinkwater was my favorite as a kid. Any suggestions? Know this is a bit all over the map.
