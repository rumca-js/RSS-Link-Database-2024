<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>RSDS is a novel decentralized information sharing protocol that empowers users to own, distribute and discover content. Think of it like a decentralized Twitter where data is entirely in the user&#39;s hands and where everyone is free to post content and subscribe to new posts.</p> <p>It could be also be compared to decentralized version of global RSS feed.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I just launched a free, super simple tool to help you extract the RSS feed from podcasts on Spotify into RSS.<br/> With this, you can quickly select a link and listen to podcasts on your preferred platform, whether thatâ€™s Pocket Casts, Overcast, or something else.<br/> I built this because I was tired of listening to the Spotify app and wanted something fast and accessible for everyone. It works like a charm for people who want flexibility or prefer open podcast players.</p> <p>Would love your feedback and suggestions. let me know what you think!</p> <p>link: <a href="https://www.get-rss.com/">https://www.get-rss.com/</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Civil_Fudge"> /u/Civil_Fudge </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1h141ie/cant_find_a_tool_to_get_spotifys_rss_i_built_one/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1h141ie/cant_find_
