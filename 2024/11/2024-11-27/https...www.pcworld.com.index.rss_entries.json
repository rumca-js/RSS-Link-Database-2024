We don\u2019t know how much they\u2019ll cost, but \u201ca whole helluva lot\u201d seems like a safe bet. And apparently that\u2019ll be true even if you\u2019re buying them in a massive industrial server, which is the first place where we\u2019ve seen a price attached. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>More specifically, we\u2019ve seen it in Europe, courtesy of <a href=\"https://www.hardwareluxx.de/index.php/news/hardware/grafikkarten/64980-comino-ai-workstation-vorbestellung-mit-geforce-rtx-5090-f%C3%BCr-40-000-bis-50-000-euro.html\">German site HardwareLuxx</a> (via <a href=\"https://videocardz.com/newz/gpu-server-with-eight-unreleased-geforce-rtx-5090-cards-costs-e50000-around-e5k-for-one",

I\u2019m trying to hold out for another year, but it\u2019s not easy with bigger and bigger discounts coming in every day. Take this 49-inch MSI OLED ultrawide, for example: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/MSI-MPG-491CQP-QD-OLED-response/dp/B0CTRXCNV8/\">it\u2019s just $799.99 on Amazon</a>, a solid THOUSAND BUCKS less than some other 49-inch OLEDs. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The MPG 491CQP is a dual-QHD design, probably using the same 49-inch, 5120\u00d71440 panel as <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/2374348/49-inch-oled-gaming-monitor-hits-a-new-low-at-900.html\">Gigabyte\u2019s alternative</a>. At 144Hz refresh and .03ms response, it\u2019s a little less zippy than some similar OLED monitors, but if you\u2019re pushing that much resolution I doubt you\u2019ll be maxing out its framerate on any 3D",
