That's a question that used to be a fairly simple one--Fortnite became popular as a battle royale, so \"games like Fortnite\" usually meant other battle royale games. The situation is a little bit different now that we're in Fortnite's seventh year of existence, as Epic Games' metaverse has grown in a lot of different ways. On top of that battle royale mode, there's Fortnite Festival, Lego Fortnite, Rocket Racing, and thousands of user-created islands in the bottomless pit that is Fortnite Creative.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Fortnite is still primarily known as a battle royale, judging by the player-counts--but the rest of Fortnite continues to grow.
