        "description": "<p>There were spells in this game when it looked a question of how many Club Brugge fancied winning by. As Cameron Carter-Vickers stroked home an embarrassing own goal to send the Belgians in front, Celtic were in a state of panic. The stars were in stripes.</p><p>Celtic have no cause to care that they snatched a point. Indeed, Brugge\u2019s profligacy should be of no concern whatsoever to Brendan Rodgers. This draw, earned courtesy of Daizen Maeda\u2019s glorious strike, leaves Celtic on course to reach the playoff round of the Champions League. This was an outcome which proved the beauty of football; Brugge\u2019s style and swagger were ultimately matched by Celtic\u2019s desire not to lose. No wonder Rodgers cut a contended figure afterwards, even if his claim that Celtic were the better second-half team was highly dubious. Eight points from five outings is a strong return.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/27/celtic-club-brugge-champions-league-match-report\">Continue reading",

It is 100 years this Friday since Puccini died, but he does more of the Covent Garden box office\u2019s heavy lifting than ever. Tosca, La Boh\u00e8me and Turandot are all slated for runs this season.</p><p>A revival like this one tells you why. With the three principal roles strongly cast, and the orchestra in buoyant form, only the hardest of critical hearts can resist. Yes, Tosca is a crude and melodramatic opera. And, no, the third act does not quite measure up to the first two. But Puccini\u2019s musical ambition and his theatrical punch are masterly.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/nov/27/puccini-tosca-review-royal-opera-ho",

No one my age had a sibling except a pair of twins at school. People used the words \u201csister\u201d and \u201cbrother\u201d to mean cousin.
