<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>The game refuses to launch. I click on the launcher, the little square appears with the game title, then it closes and then nothing. I checked task manager. Nothing&#39;s there. I even tried to cut the middleman out and launch the game itself without launcher, didn&#39;t work. Put it through steam too. Still didn&#39;t work. Anyone know any fixes to this?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi. Since Sunday I have been trying to install RDR2 on my pc, I tried DODI Repacks, Fitgirl and Elamigos, each and every one of them failed for no reason. I swear I reinstalled more than 3 times each one and disabled the antivirus and firewall completely, and still, nothing.</p> <p>Elamigos rdr2 used to work for me, but now out of nowhere it tells me something about a FFFFF error, if you can help me resolve that error or can help me with my other errors with DODI and Fitgirl, I would also appreciate it. Thanks in advance &lt;3</p> <p>(My discord is ar2bit2 if u want to help me more easily)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Sea_Win_2504"> /u/Sea_Win_2504 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CrackSupport/comments/1h0wsf0/i_cant_play_rdr2/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CrackSupport/comments/1h0wsf0/i_cant_play_rdr2/">[comments]</a></span>
