The FTC has opened a broad antitrust investigation into Microsoft, including of its software licensing and cloud computing business. Bloomberg first reported the news. Reuters reports: The probe was approved by FTC Chair Lina Khan ahead of her likely departure in January. The election of Donald Trump as U.S. president and the expectation he will appoint a fellow Republican with a softer approach toward business, leaves the outcome of the investigation up in the air.
 
The FTC is examining allegations that the software giant is potentially abusing its market power in productivity software by imposing punitive licensing terms to prevent customers from moving their data from its Azure cloud service to other competitive platforms, sources confirmed earlier this month. The FTC is also looking at practices related to cybersecurity and artificial intelligence products, the source said on Wednesday.<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">

An anonymous reader quotes a report from KrebsOnSecurity: Two men have been arrested for allegedly stealing data from and extorting dozens of companies that used the cloud data storage company Snowflake, but a third suspect -- a prolific hacker known as Kiberphant0m -- remains at large and continues to publicly extort victims. However, this person's identity may not remain a secret for long: A careful review of Kiberphant0m's daily chats across multiple cybercrime personas suggests they are a U.S. Army soldier who is or was recently stationed in South Korea.
 
Kiberphant0m's identities on cybercrime forums and on Telegram and Discord chat channels have been selling data stolen from customers of the cloud data storage company Snowflake. At the end of 2023, malicious hackers discovered that many companies had uploaded huge volumes of sensitive customer data to Snowflake accounts that were protected with nothing more than a username and password (no multi-factor authentication required)

The Verge's Wes Davis reports: A new startup created by former Android leaders aims to build an operating system for AI agents. Among them is Hugo Barra, Google's former VP of Android product management, who says the new company -- named "/dev/agents" -- will revisit the leaders' "Android roots."
 
"We can see the promise of AI agents, but as a developer, it's just too hard to build anything good," /dev/agents cofounder and CEO and Google's former Android VP of engineering David Singleton told Bloomberg. He said the industry needs "an Android-like moment for AI."
 
The company is working on a cloud-based "next-gen operating system for AI agents" intended "for trusted agents to work with users across all of their devices," Singleton wrote in a post on X. He said that AI agents will "need new UI patterns, a reimagined privacy model, and a developer platform that makes it radically simpler to build useful agents."<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">

PetaPixel: Leica Camera announced that its 2023/2024 fiscal year saw it achieve the highest revenue in the entire history of the company. It saw 14% growth to 554 million euros ($586.3 million) over last year's already spectacular 485 million euros. 

Last winter, Leica announced that it had set a sales record for the 2022/23 financial year and it has shattered that achievement now in 2024. The company says it was able to build on its successful business and sustain the growth of its earnings. The biggest driver of the company's success remains unchanged: cameras. While Leica has bolstered its business with its Mobile Imaging segment (smartphone technology and partnerships), the core of its business remains stand-alone cameras and the support of photography. 

Specifically, Leica says that the most potent revenue driver this year was the Leica Q3. However, it did not elaborate on sales numbers for this camera. 2024 is the best fiscal year so far in the almost 100-year history of the

More than half of longer English posts on LinkedIn are likely generated by AI, according to research from AI detection firm Originality AI. The company analyzed nearly 9,000 public posts over 100 words published between 2018 and 2024, finding AI usage surged 189% after ChatGPT's launch in early 2023, Wired reported Wednesday. 

LinkedIn, which also offers AI writing tools to premium subscribers, told Wired that it does not track AI-generated content levels but maintains "robust defenses" against low-quality and duplicate posts.<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">

Wil Shipley, announcing the end of Delicious Library, a media cataloging app: Amazon has shut off the feed that allowed Delicious Library to look up items, unfortunately limiting the app to what users already have (or enter manually). 

I wasn't contacted about this. 

I've pulled it from the Mac App Store and shut down the website so nobody accidentally buys a non-functional app. John Gruber of DaringFireball adds: The end of an era, but it's kind of surprising it was still functional until now. (Shipley has been a full-time engineer at Apple for three years now.) 

It's hard to describe just what a sensation Delicious Library was when it debuted, and how influential it was. Delicious Library was simultaneously very useful, in very practical ways, and obsessed with its exuberant UI in ways that served no purpose other than looking cool as shit. It was an app that demanded to be praised just for the way it looked, but also served a purpose that resonated with many users. For about a

Chinese companies are aggressively recruiting foreign tech talent as a key strategy to gain technological supremacy, prompting national security concerns across Western nations and Asia, WSJ reported Wednesday, citing multiple intelligence officials and corporate sources. The campaign focuses particularly on advanced semiconductor expertise, with companies like Huawei offering triple salaries to employees at critical firms like Zeiss SMT and ASML, which produce essential components for cutting-edge chip manufacturing. 

These recruitment efforts intensified after Western export controls restricted China's access to advanced technology. While Taiwan and South Korea have implemented strict countermeasures, including criminal penalties for illegal talent transfers, the U.S. and Europe struggle to balance open labor markets with national security concerns. 

Chinese firms often obscure their origins through local ventures and persistent recruitment tactics. The strategy has shown results

The Philippine Army is recruiting civilian hackers to bolster its cybersecurity defenses amid rising digital threats from China, army officials said. The 120-member Cyber Battalion has hired 70 tech experts in their 20s and 30s since 2020, offering them military training and the opportunity to serve the nation despite lower wages than private sector jobs. 

The initiative follows cyber attacks on Philippine government servers, including those of the Coast Guard and President Marcos Jr., which authorities traced to China. Beijing denies involvement. The Philippines ranks among the countries most vulnerable to cyber threats, with recent attacks compromising millions of citizens' data through state and private institutions.<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">

Nearly 89% of smart device manufacturers fail to disclose how long they will provide software updates for their products, a Federal Trade Commission staff study found this week. The review of 184 connected devices, including hearing aids, security cameras and door locks, revealed that 161 products lacked clear information about software support duration on their websites. 

Basic internet searches failed to uncover this information for two-thirds of the devices. "Consumers stand to lose a lot of money if their smart products stop delivering the features they want," said Samuel Levine, Director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection. The agency warned that manufacturers' failure to provide software update information for warranted products costing over $15 may violate the Magnuson Moss Warranty Act. The FTC also cautioned that companies could violate the FTC Act if they misrepresent product usability periods. The study excluded laptops, personal computers, tablets and automobiles

A piracy ring that gave 22 million subscribers in Europe cheap access to content stolen from international streaming services has been shut down by Italian authorities after a two-year investigation. From a report: The criminal enterprise used a complex international IT system to "capture and resell" live programming and other on-demand content from companies including sports broadcaster DAZN, Netflix, Amazon Prime, Paramount, Sky and Disney+, prosecutors said in a statement on Wednesday. 

Authorities estimate the operation generated revenues of roughly $264.3 million a month [non-paywalled link], or $3.2 billion a year, and caused combined damages of more than $10.6 billion to the affected broadcast companies. "The rate of profit you get from these illegal activities with lower risk is equivalent to that of cocaine trafficking," Francesco Curcio, the criminal prosecutor who led the investigation, told reporters.<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">

Singapore is positioning itself as a key testing ground for autonomous vehicles, attracting major Chinese firms and establishing unified national guidelines that contrast with fragmented regulations in the U.S. and China. 

China's WeRide launched the country's first public autonomous bus service on Sentosa island in June, while multiple companies are deploying self-driving vehicles for logistics and transportation. The controlled rollout aligns with Singapore's strategy to address labor shortages and land constraints. 

Singapore topped KPMG's Autonomous Vehicles Readiness Index, with companies citing its political neutrality and stringent safety standards as major draws for testing operations.<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">

Startup Spines plans to publish up to 8,000 books in 2025 using AI, charging authors between $1,200 and $5,000 for editing, design and distribution services. The venture-backed company, which recently secured $16 million in funding, promises to reduce publishing timelines to two to three weeks while allowing authors to retain full royalties. 

Co-founder Yehuda Niv describes Spines as a "publishing platform" rather than self-publishing. The announcement has drawn criticism from industry professionals. Independent publisher Canongate condemned the company for automating book production "with the least possible attention, care or craft." The Society of Authors urged writers to exercise caution, citing concerns about AI systems potentially trained on unlicensed content.<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">

Microsoft has confirmed that Windows 11 24H2 has issues with USB-connected devices that support the Scanner Communication Language (eSCL) protocol. From a report: A compatibility hold has been applied to the hardware. The hold means that hardware connected to a USB device supporting the eSCL protocol will not be offered an upgrade to Windows 11 24H2. Microsoft said: "This issue primarily affects USB-connected multifunction devices or standalone scanners that support scan functionality and the eSCL protocol." 

According to Microsoft, the issue lies in device discovery. Install Windows 11 24H2, wait for it to discover USB-connected peripherals, and... nothing. Or as Microsoft put it: "You might observe that your device does not discover the USB-connected peripheral and the device discovery does not complete." The company added: "This issue is caused due to the device not switching out of eSCL mode to USB mode, which allows the scanner drivers to be matched."<p><div class="share_submis

An anonymous reader quotes a report from TechCrunch: Security researchers have uncovered two previously unknown zero-day vulnerabilities that are being actively exploited by RomCom, a Russian-linked hacking group, to target Firefox browser users and Windows device owners across Europe and North America. RomCom is a cybercrime group that is known to carry out cyberattacks and other digital intrusions for the Russian government. The group -- which was last month linked to a ransomware attack targeting Japanese tech giant Casio -- is also known for its aggressive stance against organizations allied with Ukraine, which Russia invaded in 2014.
 
Researchers with security firm ESET say they found evidence that RomCom combined use of the two zero-day bugs -- described as such because the software makers had no time to roll out fixes before they were used to hack people -- to create a "zero click" exploit, which allows the hackers to remotely plant malware on a target's computer without any

Qualcomm's interest in acquiring Intel is cooling due to the complexity of the deal, Intel's debt, and regulatory hurdles. However, according to Bloomberg, Qualcomm may still explore acquiring certain divisions of Intel to expand into markets like PCs and networking. Tom's Hardware reports: [T]he proposed acquisition faced significant obstacles, including Intel's $50 billion debt, dropping CPU market share, and its struggling semiconductor manufacturing unit, an area where Qualcomm lacks expertise. A deal of this magnitude would also likely trigger extensive regulatory scrutiny, particularly in China, a key market for both companies.
 
Intel is undergoing significant restructuring under CEO Pat Gelsinger to reclaim its competitiveness in the semiconductor market in terms of products and process technologies. Still, for now, both Intel and Qualcomm are quite successful standalone companies. While the combination would make a formidable firm (probably facing unprecedented antitrust scr

The FCC said it has approved a license for T-Mobile and SpaceX's Starlink to provide supplemental coverage to cover internet dead zones. Reuters reports: The license marks the first time the FCC has authorized a satellite operator collaborating with a wireless carrier to provide supplemental telecommunications coverage from space on some flexible-use spectrum bands allocated to terrestrial service. The partnership aims to extend the reach of wireless networks to remote areas and eliminate "dead zones."
 
T-Mobile and SpaceX announced a partnership in 2022 and in January the first set of satellites supporting the partnership was launched into low-Earth orbit with SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket. "The FCC is actively promoting competition in the space economy by supporting more partnerships between terrestrial mobile carriers and satellite operators to deliver on a single network future that will put an end to mobile dead zones," said FCC Chair Jessica Rosenworcel.<p><div class="share_submiss

An anonymous reader quotes a report from IEEE Spectrum: Virtual- and augmented-reality setups already modify the way users see and hear the world around them. Add in haptic feedback for a sense of touch and a VR version of Smell-O-Vision, and only one major sense remains: taste. To fill the gap, researchers at the City University of Hong Kong have developed a new interface to simulate taste in virtual and other extended reality (XR). The group previously worked on other systems for wearable interfaces, such as haptic and olfactory feedback. To create a more "immersive VR experience," they turned to adding taste sensations, says Yiming Liu, a coauthor of the group's research paper published today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
 
The lollipop-shaped lickable device can produce nine different flavors: sugar, salt, citric acid, cherry, passion fruit, green tea, milk, durian, and grapefruit. Each flavor is produced by food-grade chemicals embedded in a pocket of a

The Macquarie Dictionary, the national dictionary of Australia, has picked "enshittification" as its word of the year. Gizmodo reports: The Australians define the word as "the gradual deterioration of a service or product brought about by a reduction in the quality of service provided, especially of an online platform, and as a consequence of profit-seeking." We've all felt this. Google search is filled with garbage. The internet is clogged with SEO-farming websites that clog up results. Facebook is an endless stream of AI-generated slop. Zoom wants you to test out its new AI features while you're trying to go into a meeting. Twitter has become X, and its owner thinks sharing links is a waste of time. Last night I reinstalled Windows 11 on a desktop machine and got pissed as it was finalized and Microsoft kept trying to get me to install OneDrive, Office 360, Call of Duty Black Ops 6, and a bunch of other shit I didn't want. Writer and activist Cory Doctorow coined the term enshittif

Despite significant enterprise AI hype, most job seekers remain unconvinced of its benefits, with 69% doubting its ability to enhance work performance and 62% skeptical it reduces workloads. The findings come from a study conducted by Resume Genius. The Register reports: Consistent with the majority opinion that AI in the workplace has failed to impress, only 34 percent of respondents said they were worried about being replaced by a bot, while just 30 percent think AI will increase competition for jobs or harm salaries. Broken down by generation (Boomers, Gen X, Millennials, and Gen Z job seekers all responded), the results are largely the same, with even Gen Z workers skeptical of the latest "next big thing" in enterprise tech. In short, Resume Genius's findings align with other recent studies suggesting enterprise AI's hype has not lived up to its marketing promises.<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">

Uber's gig-economy workforce now includes programmers. According to Bloomberg, "The company is expanding beyond its rideshare roots to enter a hot new market: helping other businesses outsource some of their artificial intellgience development to independent contractors." From the report: Its new AI training and data labeling division, called Scaled Solutions, builds on an internal team that tackles large-scale annotation tasks for Uber's rideshare, food delivery and freight units. According to its website, Scaled Solutions has begun serving other companies that also need high-quality datasets. Clients include Aurora Innovation Inc., an Uber-backed firm that makes self-driving software for commercial trucks, and Niantic Inc., the game developer behind Pokemon Go.
 
Uber's efforts to sell data labeling services have not previously been reported. The move could allow it to gain a piece of a growing market, as global companies rely on humans to vet data to train AI models. Scale AI Inc,

An anonymous reader quotes a report from The Verge: Huawei has announced its new Mate 70 series smartphone lineup, which will be the first offered with the company's new HarmonyOS Next operating system that doesn't rely on Google's Android services and won't run any Android apps, according to a report by Reuters. The four models of the Mate 70 also don't feature any US hardware following a half decade of US sanctions.
 
The Mate 70, Mate 70 Pro, Mate 70 Pro Plus, and Mate 70 RS will also be offered with Huawei's HarmonyOS 4.3, which first launched in August 2019 as an alternative to Google's Android OS and is still compatible with Android's extensive app library. Users who decide to opt for Huawei's new Android-free HarmonyOS Next will have less choice when it comes to the apps they can install. Huawei says it has "secured more than 15,000 applications for its HarmonyOS ecosystem, with plans to expand to 100,000 apps in the coming months," according to Reuters.
