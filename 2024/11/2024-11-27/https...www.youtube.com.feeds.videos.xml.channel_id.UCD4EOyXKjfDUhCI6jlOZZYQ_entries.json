So if you need to pull Social Security numbers, IP Addresses, Phone Numbers, etc from documents you can write a ReGEx Statement that will find everything with a specific pattern that you have assigned.\n\nRegEx is to programmers what subnet masking is to Sys Admins. Something that is incredibly important, actually not that hard, but it sort of makes everyone's brain melt.\n\nThis class will go over RegEx ",
