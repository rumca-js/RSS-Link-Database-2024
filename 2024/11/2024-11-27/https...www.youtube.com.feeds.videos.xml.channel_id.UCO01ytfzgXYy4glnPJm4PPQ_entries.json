        "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, as the incoming Trump Administration prepares to deport millions of criminal aliens, Democratic governors and mayors around the country are plotting ways to sabotage him. Also, Kamala's former campaign staffers are doing the interview circuit and trying to find someone to blame for her humiliating loss. And, of course, they're looking to blame anyone but themselves.
