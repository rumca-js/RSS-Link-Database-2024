<p>The buzz around the web is that Nvidia’s next-gen graphics cards will be <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2474060/leaked-final-specs-for-nvidias-next-gen-rtx-5090-5080-and-5070-gpus.html">coming sometime in early 2025</a>. We don’t know how much they’ll cost, but “a whole helluva lot” seems like a safe bet. And apparently that’ll be true even if you’re buying them in a massive industrial server, which is the first place where we’ve seen a price attached. </p>



<p>More specifically, we’ve seen it in Europe, courtesy of <a href="https://www.hardwareluxx.de/index.php/news/hardware/grafikkarten/64980-comino-ai-workstation-vorbestellung-mit-geforce-rtx-5090-f%C3%BCr-40-000-bis-50-000-euro.html">German site HardwareLuxx</a> (via <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/gpu-server-with-eight-unreleased-geforce-rtx-5090-cards-costs-e50000-around-e5k-for-one

<p>Damn, it’s hard to stop myself from buying some of these OLED gaming monitors as we head into Black Friday. I’m trying to hold out for another year, but it’s not easy with bigger and bigger discounts coming in every day. Take this 49-inch MSI OLED ultrawide, for example: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/MSI-MPG-491CQP-QD-OLED-response/dp/B0CTRXCNV8/">it’s just $799.99 on Amazon</a>, a solid THOUSAND BUCKS less than some other 49-inch OLEDs. </p>



<p>The MPG 491CQP is a dual-QHD design, probably using the same 49-inch, 5120×1440 panel as <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2374348/49-inch-oled-gaming-monitor-hits-a-new-low-at-900.html">Gigabyte’s alternative</a>. At 144Hz refresh and .03ms response, it’s a little less zippy than some similar OLED monitors, but if you’re pushing that much resolution I doubt you’ll be maxing out its framerate on any 3D

<p>Along with <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2519426/twitter-alternative-bluesky-just-gained-over-a-million-new-users.html">millions of other people who no longer enjoy</a> the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, I recently switched from X to Bluesky. I still have an account on X, but it’s pretty much inactive now that I’m spending my time on Bluesky instead. And despite having been present on Twitter since 2007, I’ll delete my X account at some point.</p>



<p>There’s a lot to love about <a href="https://bsky.app/">Bluesky</a> and it truly feels like a return to the glory days of Twitter, but there are also some obvious issues that may turn you off if you’re switching from X. Here are some things you might want to consider before switching to Bluesky.</p>
