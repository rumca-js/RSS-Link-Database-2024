## The Prince by Machiavelli is not Satire

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have heard a lot of people online claim that the Prince by Niccolo Machiavelli is Satire, this couldn&#39;t be further from the truth. There are very few serious historians that make this claim. There are a few reasons that people arrive at this conclusion, the most serious of which is that the philosophy of the Prince clashes with his other writing like the Discourses. In the Prince Machiavelli writes a handbook for authoritarian nobles to gain and maintain power, while all his other writings indicate that he&#39;s a staunch republican. However, Machiavelli is a realist, democracy was a far-fetched dream in renaissance Italy, He prioritized stability and reunification above all else. </p> <p>“How we live is so different from how we ought to live that he who studies what ought to be done rather than what is done will learn the way to his downfall.”</p> <p>I can&#39;t help but feel that a lot of these claim arise from an inner desire to deny the rea

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Fear and Trembling shook me to my core. I picked it up to grapple with the story of Abraham, which had always troubled me. It wasn’t so much an ethical dilemma in my view, WELL at least not in the Quranic version, where Abraham asks Ishmael for consent, and Ishmael accepts. While still unsettling, this portrayal felt less harrowing to me than the biblical account. My deeper concern, however, lay in the tension between human judgment and blind faith. Little did I know how unprepared for what Kierkegaard had to say.</p> <p>Faith, Kierkegaard argued, is fundamentally irrational <strong>a leap into the absurd</strong>. That idea terrified me. How can one immerse oneself in faith if there’s no clear path to what to believe? And how can one discern what to believe in without reason? His vision of faith, unmoored from rationality, left me deeply unsettled. Even more chilling was the realization that faith, when wielded by brilliant minds, can justify unspea

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve noticed that interviews with famous authors on Youtube get tens of thousand of views, while interviews with less-known authors often get a few hundred or less. (Popular writers are popular, duh!) But my sense is that the interviewers (and publicists and publishers) think that an interview can be a way for an author to attract new readers. I think this is mostly wrong. The main function of an interview is to provide readers with an extended experience of the novel. That is, we go find an interview with the author after we&#39;ve finished their novel and we want to spend more time with it.</p> <p>In other words, we don&#39;t need an overview of the plot. We don&#39;t need an interview that carefully avoids spoilers. Is that just me? </p> <p>What do you think? Do you seek out author interviews? When you do, what are you looking for?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/thundercatzzz"> /u/thunder

I’ve been thinking about this a lot lately, and I realized this statement, despite how “neutral” or even progressive it sounds, is actually loaded with a ton of issues. </p> <p>Let’s talk about it . </p> <p>First of all, who decides what “done well even means? Nine times out of ten, when someone says this, they’re holding stories with diverse characters to some mythical higher standard. Like, a story can’t just exist with marginalized characters or perspectives—it has to prove itself. There’s an unspoken assumption that the presence of diversity of all kinds is inherently risky or unnatural or might drive away white readers; so the story has to work extra hard to justify its existence.</p> <p>And when people say this, they’re also kind of ignoring the fact that stories with non-diverse casts don’t get the same scrutiny.

I hope you enjoy it. </p> <p>I recall watching an interview with her at the end of one of the many Masterpiece Theatre productions of her Adam Dalgliesh detective novels. She stated that when on vacation she would come across a town/city/ village that seemed an ideal location for a novel. Later she would return to the location for a longer visit writing down descriptions of interesting features of the location and inhabitants to use in her next novel. I thought that it was a superb way to ground a work of fiction in reality. </p> <p>In 2008 she published the mystery novel &quot;The Private Patient&quot;.
