<p>I first posted about the Yellow <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2022/home-assistant-yellow-pi-powered-local-automation">in 2022</a>, and walked through my smart-but-private HA Yellow setup in my Studio <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTwyInX4KyM">in a video last year</a>.</p>

<p>The Raspberry Pi <a href="http://raspberrypi.com/products/compute-module-5/">Compute Module 5</a> is smaller than a credit card, and I already have it gaming in 4K with an eGPU, running a Kubernetes cluster, and I even upgraded my NEC Commercial display from a CM4 to CM5, just swapping the Compute Modules!</p>

<p>The Compute Module 4 was hard to get for <em>years</em>. It launched right after the COVID supply chain crisis, leading to insane scalper pricing.</p>

<p>It was so <em>useful</em>, though, that Raspberry Pi sold every unit they
