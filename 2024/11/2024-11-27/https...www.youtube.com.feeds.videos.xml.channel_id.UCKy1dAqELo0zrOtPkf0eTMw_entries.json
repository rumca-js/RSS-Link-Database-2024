Just in time for some co-op gaming with the family, the award-winning It Takes Two hits the service. For those seeking some solo RTS action, Aliens: Dark Descent takes the XCOM formula and drops it into the Alien universe. And there's Temtem, a creature-capturing MMORPG. In other news, Sony has revised its PS2 lifetime worldwide sales (yes, PlayStation 2), and the number puts it at around 160 million. The closest console to that number is the Nintendo Switch, which sits at around 146 million. And finally, PlayStation's Shuhei Yoshida is retiring after 30 years with Sony. He's been behind the PlayStation brand since the beginning, from its upstart Nintendo rival days to one of the most dominant names in gaming. He's definitely earned a bit of R & R.",

While the sequel gets some laughs, it doesn't make the world Moana introduced eight years ago feel richer or more exciting. The few aspects with potential to turn this into a memorable odyssey \u2013 including an intriguing new character \u2013 are unfortunately stifled.\n\nDisney's Moana 2 opens in US theaters on November 27 and UK cinemas on November 29.\n\nWhat did you think of our movie review for this new Disney movie? Let us know in the comments!\n\n#Moana2 #Movies #Disney",
