<p>It wasn’t that long ago when “real” gamers would shun wireless keyboards, complaining about latency and interference. Those days are gone, and you can get a gaming board just as capable in wireless form as it is in wired. Unless you’re literally super-human, you’ll never spot the difference. </p>



<p>And gaming keyboard makers have catered to the desire to go untethered. Though they generally carry a price premium, wireless gaming keyboards boast the latest features and capabilities, from fancy RGB lighting to cutting-edge adjustable actuation. Here are the best on the market.</p>



<p><strong>Why you should trust me: </strong>PCWorld has been the go-to name for personal computer news and reviews for over 40 years. And as the writer of this roundup, and the reviewer of most of the keyboards on this list, I can assure you that my picks have been thoroug

<p>If you type “<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2331808/can-500-get-you-a-good-gaming-laptop.html">laptops under $500</a>” into any search bar, you’ll be faced with a flood of results. Although you’ll see a lot of options, most aren’t worth the price, no matter the discount. That’s why it’s absolutely vital to shop smart here.

<p>So, you’ve bought, or are planning to buy, a new monitor during the Black Friday sales, now what? While most monitors are fairly simple to set up, if you want to personalize your monitor further, you’ll need a few extra addons.</p>



<p>I’m talking about things like a surge protector, screen cleaning kit, and USB hub. Getting the right cable for your monitor (HDMI or DisplayPort 1.4) is a big consideration too. A monitor arm is a worthwhile investment as well — it’s going to let you view your monitor at exactly the angle you want so that you don’t have to strain your neck. </p>



<p>You could buy these things later on or snap them up now, while they are top of mind, and while some or all of them are discounted for the holidays. If you decide to snap up a bargain, here’s a list of the top 10 items to go for.</p>

<p>The release of Firefox 133 brings further improved privacy protection through bounce tracking protection. A number of fixed vulnerabilities improve security. Firefox ESR, Tor Browser and Thunderbird also receive updates.</p>



<p>Mozilla’s <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2024-63/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">security report 2024-63</a> lists 17 fixed vulnerabilities for Firefox 133. Mozilla classifies two of the vulnerabilities as high risk: CVE-2024-11691 only affects Mac computers with Apple’s M processors (“Apple Silicon”).

<p>Damn, it’s hard to stop myself from buying some of these OLED gaming monitors as we head into Black Friday. I’m trying to hold out for another year, but it’s not easy with bigger and bigger discounts coming in every day. Take this 49-inch MSI OLED ultrawide, for example: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/MSI-MPG-491CQP-QD-OLED-response/dp/B0CTRXCNV8/">it’s just $799.99 on Amazon</a>, a solid THOUSAND BUCKS less than some other 49-inch OLEDs. </p>



<p>The MPG 491CQP is a dual-QHD design, probably using the same 49-inch, 5120×1440 panel as <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2374348/49-inch-oled-gaming-monitor-hits-a-new-low-at-900.html">Gigabyte’s alternative</a>. At 144Hz refresh and .03ms response, it’s a little less zippy than some similar OLED monitors, but if you’re pushing that much resolution I doubt you’ll be maxing out its framerate on any 3D

<p>This one is easily my favorite power bank I’ve ever owned. I’ve had it for a while now. It always ends up in my bag, even though it’s not exactly the lightest one I own, because the massive 25,000mAh power capacity is exactly what I need when I’m on the go. With 145W power output, I can use it to charge my laptop, my phone, tablet, and anything else that’s running low.</p>



<p>Since it features three ports – two type C and one USB-A – I can even use it to charge multiple devices at once. I love it, and you’ll love it too. Of course, the output will drop quite a bit if you have a cable plugged in every
