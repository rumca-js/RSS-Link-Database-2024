In today's Daily Fix:
The PlayStation Plus games coming in December 2024 have been revealed. Just in time for some co-op gaming with the family, the award-winning It Takes Two hits the service. For those seeking some solo RTS action, Aliens: Dark Descent takes the XCOM formula and drops it into the Alien universe. And there's Temtem, a creature-capturing MMORPG. In other news, Sony has revised its PS2 lifetime worldwide sales (yes, PlayStation 2), and the number puts it at around 160 million. The closest console to that number is the Nintendo Switch, which sits at around 146 million. And finally, PlayStation's Shuhei Yoshida is retiring after 30 years with Sony. He's been behind the PlayStation brand since the beginning, from its upstart Nintendo rival days to one of the most dominant names in gaming. He's definitely earned a bit of R & R.

Watch our IGN Moana 2 review by Carlos Aguilar, narrated by Ronny Barrier.

The ill-conceived Moana 2 is a reminder of what was noteworthy in the original, namely the songs and the humorous supporting characters. While the sequel gets some laughs, it doesn't make the world Moana introduced eight years ago feel richer or more exciting. The few aspects with potential to turn this into a memorable odyssey – including an intriguing new character – are unfortunately stifled.

Disney's Moana 2 opens in US theaters on November 27 and UK cinemas on November 29.

New Arc Line is out now in Early Access on Steam, Epic Games Store, and GOG. Check out the New Arc Line early access launch trailer for this story-rich RPG that invites players to explore the abundant yet troubled realm where magic and technology collide. 

The New World awaits, and with it, the last beacon of hope for a potential cure for a global plague that threatens your loved ones as well. But all is not as it seems - tensions simmer beneath the gilded surface of New Arc. Arcane magic clashes with steampunk ingenuity, the wealthy exploit the impoverished, and prejudice festers between humans and other races. As a stranger in this volatile land, you are thrust into the heart of the conflict. Your choices will not only shape your own fate but also the future of this fractured world.

Will you side with the established powers or champion the downtrodden? Will you embrace the arcane arts or harness the power of technology?
