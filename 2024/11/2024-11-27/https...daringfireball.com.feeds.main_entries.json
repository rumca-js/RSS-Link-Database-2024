I\ninvite you to look again at some of the screenshots and artwork in\nthis application. Someone loved those graphics. Someone sweated\nover every pixel of that application window. Someone knows what it\nmeans to be a lover of art, music, books, video games. This is <em>in\naddition to</em> (not instead of) the ability to write great code.</p>\n\n<p>All of these human facilities and experiences have been harnessed\nto create not just a mere \u201cprogram\u201d, \u201capplication\u201d or (God forbid)\n\u201cexecutable\u201d, but a digital love letter to collectors.
