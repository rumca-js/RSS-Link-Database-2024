I think this is because they are very slow paced and the romance doesn’t get introduced very early. Do you guys have anything in mind?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I watched a TikTok video a while back, in the video, the main character was stuck underground in a cavern/big cave and one of his arms was injured (I think it’s his left arm but aren’t too sure), his friends were above ground and were in a battle/fight. Then, another character appears behind him and asks if he’s too weak to go help his friends and the character with the injured arm try’s to punch his way out of the cavern/cave but he can’t and his arm is even more sore now. Then the character that appeared behind him offers him to merge body’s or something and he becomes more powerful and is able to get out of the cave. I saw this ages ago but I think there was also these white tendril like appendages when they merged and then they were one body. Again, take this with a grain of salt as I might’ve misremembered some of it. Thank you very much if you’re able to find it</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/u
