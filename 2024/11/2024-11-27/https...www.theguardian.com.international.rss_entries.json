Using a small digital videocamera and her smartphone, Abrahams records intimate, candid conversations with her mother and grandmother, and the resulting movie is a lucid, emotionally honest account of trauma that lies beneath the smiles of family photos and wedding videos.</p><p>Abrahams shows the crisis of loyalty and agony of an abusive marriage, but shows also how the generational trauma can be healed when the generations come together.
