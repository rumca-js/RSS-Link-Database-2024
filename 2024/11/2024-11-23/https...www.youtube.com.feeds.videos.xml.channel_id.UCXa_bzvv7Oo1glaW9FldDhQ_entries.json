Inspired by The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild with Studio Ghibli films as its aesthetic influence, it could offer something unique, even in early access.\n\nAt the start, that's how it seemingly begins, as you become a junior architect for a tribe to reclaim Aghasba. Unfortunately, it wastes the charming cast and gorgeous art style beneath a series of near-endless checklists, annoying progression, half-baked mechanics, unbalanced enemies, and a user experience that desperately wants you to stop playing.\n\nMoonlit Games has released some patches and improved some annoying aspects, but Towers of Aghasba is still very difficult to recommend in early access. Unless sweeping changes are made, it's simply too frustrating with too much inane busy work.", "id": 1573698, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7LqjX6Sdn0", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 129, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/k7LqjX6Sdn0/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Towers of Aghasba Early Access Review - Simply Too Frustrating With Too Much Busy Work", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "author": "GamingBolt", "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-11-23T15:30:05+00:00", "description": "As a follow-up to one of the best-looking games, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 has its work cut out, not only improving on Asobo Studio's \"digital twin\" of Earth but also the physics, aircraft modeling, and data streaming. It's superior in every aspect, with more attention to detail, an improved lighting system and enhanced realism.\n\nHowever, there are some caveats. While running it below the ideal specs, there was some occasional stuttering in the PC version for busier locations and loading to and from maps feels a little iffy. Xbox Series X is more stable, despite falling slightly behind in draw distance and other details, but it also faces the same map loading issue.\n\nDespite all this, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 is a gorgeous experience. Flying out over locations, admiring the reflections in the water or the incredible skyboxes is a joy, backed by naturally lit environments, detailed aircraft with meticulous cockpits, and an awe-inspiring sense of scale.", "id": 1572675, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CA8Ipf9DS88", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 129, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/CA8Ipf9DS88/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 Looks Great But What Is Going On With Xbox & PC Performance?", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "author": "GamingBolt", "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-11-23T10:30:21+00:00", "description": "At its core, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 is a fantastic game.
