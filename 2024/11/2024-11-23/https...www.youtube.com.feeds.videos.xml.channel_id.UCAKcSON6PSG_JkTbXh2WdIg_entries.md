Chicago band Brigitte Calls Me Baby first grabbed everyone’s attention at SXSW in 2023. Not long after, they were signed to ATO Records, and have been on a steady track of touring and recording. 

On a visit to the Twin Cities to perform a show at the Fine Line in Minneapolis, Brigitte Calls Me Baby visited The Current studio to play three songs from their 2024 album, "The Future Is Our Way Out." Watch the performance of "We Were Never Alive" above.
