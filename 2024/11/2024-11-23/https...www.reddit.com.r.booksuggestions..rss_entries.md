## Best reimagining/retelling of classics?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I think the idea of retellings are so interesting, and it can be a chance for authors to really reimagine a text using their persinal experiences and how they view the world, while still having the story everyone knows. I like the idea of the original novels themes being explored and giving a perspective that is outside my own. Only problem is i dont really know where to start, i know there was a boom a while back in publishing where retellings/reimaginings were getting put out pretty regularly, and now its overwhelming to find stuff. Im not looking for specifics so anything goes, even though i know Pride and Predjudice is probably the one that is most popular to retell. If it works it works. What are some stand outs you would recommend?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/milkshakeslurper"> /u/milkshakeslurper </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1gyccpn/best_r

But I&#39;m into most historical war settings. I&#39;m also really into horror and mystery. But. Yeah, just looking for some recommendations. I went into the book store today to see if anything looked good, but I honestly couldn&#39;t tell. They all kinda just looked like b movie covers. Any recommendations would be helpful.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Doing a little research on cyberpunk for a novel I&#39;m writing. It&#39;s a criticism of the genre so don&#39;t be afraid to throw whatever at me. So far I&#39;ve read <em>Neuromancer</em>, which was conceptually interesting but I found hard to read at times, <em>Snow Crash</em>, which I loved and thought was really unique, and I just finished <em>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</em>, which I enjoyed overall, but I guess felt confused about the ending?</p> <p>Ideally, I want some recommendations of foundational cyberpunk to really get to the root of why this genre is so compelling, but if you can think of more modern takes I&#39;ll be glad to add them to my reading list. Even if it feels derivative, but you still liked it. Modern cyberpunk is the thing I&#39;m mostly interesting in analyzing anyway.</p> <p>Thanks.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/69krampus420"> /u/69krampus420 </a> <br/> <sp

I‚Äôm a big history fan, and love reading historical non-fiction, particularly on 20th century events. Usually, I discuss what I read or other history topics with my wife, who is happy to listen to me ramble on and on but often argues that she doesn‚Äôt have a lot of history knowledge and is not particularly interested in actively seeking it out. She dislikes history non-fiction, finds it very boring, even when the topic is something that she finds interesting (e.g., feminism and women‚Äôs stories).</p> <p>Recently, she started reading ‚ÄúAnna Karenina‚Äù (which I shamefully have not read yet) and I was extremely happy when she came to me for us to discuss the Russian Empire, and how it was structured. It was a great bonding experience, and made me want to seek out more historical fiction books that we could bond over discussing the overal theme. She is n

Definitely not high fantasy though. Very well written -- she was an English major, so that&#39;s tremendously important.

## Trying to remember the book I read in the early 2000‚Äôs. It was about a girl/teenager that moves to a haunted house and there‚Äôs a black cat she calls Houdini.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure if the book was new when I read it. So it&#39;s likely from the late 90&#39;s early 2000&#39;s I believe the title was &quot;haunting of &quot;something&quot; house or manor. Which has made googling it pretty difficult. I believe the version of the cover I read was mostly reddish and black. I don&#39;t remember much else about the book other than the cat that would keep showing up disappearing and the main character called him Houdini. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/BluejayBudget"> /u/BluejayBudget </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1gxmbpz/trying_to_remember_the_book_i_read_in_the_early/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1gxmbpz/trying_to_remember_the_book_i_read_in_the_early/">[comments]</a></span>
