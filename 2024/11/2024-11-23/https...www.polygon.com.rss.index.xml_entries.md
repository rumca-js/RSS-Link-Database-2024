<p class="has-text-align-none">The great Hong Kong filmmaker Johnnie To is broadly known for his riveting gangster dramas, with operatic gun fights, tense drama, and conflicted characters. But To is a skilled filmmaker in many different genres, and one of my favorite films of his is the excellent romantic comedy <em>Don’t Go Breaking My Heart</em>, which he co-directed with frequent collaborator Wai Ka-fai. It’s one of the best love triangle movies ever, and it’s a perfect movie to get cozy and watch with someone you have a crush on this holiday season. And if you want to watch it, the clock is ticking: It’s leaving Netfli

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Arcane </em>has come to an end — but the closing out of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tv/479775/arcane-league-of-legends-season-2-vi-jinx-act-2-review">Vi, Jinx</a>, Caitlyn, Jayce, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tv/480196/arcane-viktor-pathetic-hot-act-season-2">Viktor</a>’s stories is more like a beginning than an ending. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">According to Riot Games, Fortiche, and Netflix, the show’s finale didn’t arrive because it’s getting canceled; rather, it’s because it was simply the end of this particular story. But it’s certainly not the end to animated collaborations between Riot Games and Fortiche set in the <em>Lea

<p class="has-text-align-none">We’re nearing the end of another month, and that means quite a few great movies are leaving their current streaming services. Thanks to the Thanksgiving holiday in America, you’re likely to have a little extra free time at the end of November, so we’ve collected a few of the best movies to catch up on before they vanish.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This month’s selections include a horror sequel that’s way better than it has any right to be, a biopic to satisfy the boxing itch you definitely didn’t get anywhere else this month, a thriller full of questions about AI, and one of the best bank robbery movies of all time.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You can get<strong> Go Safari Balls</strong> as part of <em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/pokemon-go/38713">Pokémon Go</a></em> “Wild Area: Global”, and can only be used during event hours. No, seriously — they disappear after the event ends.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These balls are based off of the regular camouflaged-print Safari Balls from the mainline games. Usually, you can only use Safari Balls in the Safari Zone, a special area where wild Pokémon roam and you can’t actually <em>battle</em> them. You can throw treats and rocks at them to try to increase their catch rate, but ultimately, you just had to huck Safari Balls at
