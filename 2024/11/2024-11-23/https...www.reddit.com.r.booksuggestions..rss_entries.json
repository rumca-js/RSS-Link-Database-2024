Romance but not smutty and maybe with a protagonist who&#39;s a bit older -- at least not in their twenties.</p> <p>Thank you!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/thrwawy296\"> /u/thrwawy296 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1gy6whp/motherinlaw_gift_ideas_anything_similar_to/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1gy6whp/motherinlaw_gift_ideas_anything_similar_to/\">[comments]</a></span>", "id": 1573384, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1gy6whp/motherinlaw_gift_ideas_anything_similar_to", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 532, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Mother-in-law gift ideas: Anything similar to Outlander?", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "author": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-11-23T18:19:29+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I don&#39;t even know what to call it but mainly i&#39;m looking for books like Hunger Games, Dune, The Handmaid&#39;s Tale, preferably with romance as a secondary storyline too. </p> <p>Also any good apocalyptic books you&#39;d recommend for someone who&#39;s never read any of those before? </p> <p>Thank you \u263a\ufe0f</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/HopefulAnxiousCat\"> /u/HopefulAnxiousCat </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1gy627c/best_alternative_reality_apocalyptic_books/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1gy627c/best_alternative_reality_apocalyptic_books/\">[comments]</a></span>", "id": 1573108, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1gy627c/best_alternative_reality_apocalyptic_books", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 532, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Best alternative reality/ apocalyptic books?", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "author": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-11-23T17:44:06+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Just finished The Haunting of Hill House by Shirley Jackson and looking for other novels with the same atmosphere.

These days I\u2019m able to listen to audiobooks as I walk my dog for hours every week. It feels great that I\u2019ve finished these 3 books, and I\u2019m looking for more. The issue is that I don\u2019t really know where to start. I picked these books from the list that\u2019s included in my account on Spotify, really no rhyme or reason in the choice.</p> <p>Before I\u2019m going to be a whiny B, I want to state that I found the authors\u2019 works, their craft, amazing. Not like I\u2019m anyone to critique literature and writers, but through most of these stories, I can see why these writers are at the top of their game. Sadly, I\u2019m very particular for what media I enjoy consuming. I\u2019m the type of person who spends an hour browsing Netflix, only to find nothing, turn off the TV and go to sleep. In fact, I knew enough about these books that I should have considered stopping after about", "id": 1571779, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1gxyzfe/lit_fic_for_a_middle_ager_here_are_3_i_didnt_love", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 532, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Lit fic for a middle ager (here are 3 I didn\u2019t love)", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "author": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-11-23T12:47:33+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Any genre, fiction or non-fiction, any gender is fine.
