Nothing that deep, nothing that special</p> <p>2nd reason: the nostalgia factor. Sometimes you just wanna go back to those games that came 1st in your life. To give an example: in the FPS category, Classic DOOM is the <strong>KING</strong> for me, and is the N#1 of its kind. However, it wasn&#39;t part of my childhood. The OG Medal of Honor was indeed part of my childhood, and while I consider it inferior from a critical POV, MOH causes this warm/cozy feeling in me</p> <p>Anyway, which is your criteria to go back to certain games?
