<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi, I tried to follow the instructions to set up raspbian so I can just connect USB, get a virtual network device, and ssh in to the pi (Zero W 2). However, none of the instructions ended up working. I worked out that the files in /boot have moved and made some progress (got a virtual network device to show up) but there are no updated instructions out there so it is just really really slow going.</p> <p>Is there a straightforward image out there that is just ready to go?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/jschall2"> /u/jschall2 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1gy339u/image_that_just_works_for_headless_usb_setup/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1gy339u/image_that_just_works_for_headless_usb_setup/">[comments]</a></span>
