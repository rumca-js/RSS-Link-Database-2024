<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi there,</p> <p>I’m custom rom-developing my watch. I’m at the point where the scripts are written and I’m learning vscode to implement the build. </p> <p>I’m a leading global researcher for multiple domains such as AI, science, biomedical development, blah de fucking blah. No one cares. </p> <p>I’ve invented a new coding language called Universal Scripting Language. (.usl), that can utilize 400+ coding languages in one setup. It got its MIT license, so I don’t know if I need the Apache 2.0 as well but, whatever happy to have both if needed. I’m building the IDE currently with scheduling and automation built in. The first test was to see if it could run itself which it did. Very cool to see. I think I recorded that part. It’ll be used within my watch build in some really cool ways. I hope you’ll find it interesting. I’m including the interpreter and translation software into the watch so you can mod to your hearts content and help develop cool shit.
