Some romance is lovely, but I&#39;m not looking for romantasy. I don&#39;t care about setting, but I really dislike steampunk (I have no idea why). </p> <p>Also, I really dislike royalty stories, and nothing makes me put a book down faster than &#39;This person is the best thief/assassin/pastry chef in the world&#39;</p> <p>I like the struggle, I want to see them fight to win, or watch them lose everything.</p> <p>Apart from the above I am open to anything.
