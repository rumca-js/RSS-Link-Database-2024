<p>When photographer <a href="https://www.trentmitchell.com/">Trent Mitchell</a> was on the road looking for surf all over Australia he’d throw a couple of rolls of film in the bag and snap pictures here and there.

<ul><li>Former England back hits out at governing body</li><li>Simon Halliday: ‘Clubs have been stalled and misled’</li></ul><p>Top officials at the Rugby Football Union have been accused of betraying and misleading the game by the former England international who has been helping to negotiate the sport’s future below the Premiership. Simon Halliday, part of England’s 1992 Five Nations grand slam-winning side, has also called for a review into the “significant” failings of some RFU executive directors.</p><p>Halliday, who was chair of European Professional Club Rugby for seven years until 2021, has latterly been representing Championship clubs seeking greater funding and firm guarantees from the RFU over promotion and relegation. In an excoriating letter sent to the RFU’s chair, Tom Ilube, seen by the <em>Observer</em>, he alleges the existing tier 2 clubs “have been stalled, misled and misinformed” and warns recent poor governance “threatens the game” in England.</p> <a href="https:

Like other sufferers of this most unlikely of conditions, she is triggered by the merest traces of banana: a skin mouldering in a far-off wastepaper basket; a lingering smell; the sense that until recently something bendy and yellow lurked next to the perfectly innocent apples and oranges in the bowl on that coffee&nbsp;table.</p><p>We can only hope, then, that the minister was – trigger warning – nowhere near the big auction house news of last week, in which a banana sold for $5.2m (£4.1m) at Sotheby’s New York.

<p>A win was what Queens Park Rangers, bottom of the Championship, required. In the end a point against Stoke was something to still embrace, particularly after an agonising first-half miss from the hosts’ struggling centre forward Zan Celar.</p><p>Signed in the summer from the Swiss side Lugano, Celar stepped up for a penalty in the 27th minute, this both the perfect opportunity to finally score for his new club and equalise after a thunderous Tom Cannon opener just moments earlier. Fifteen previous league appearances had brought zilch, but his own fans waited behind the goal, ready to partake in this moment of exultation. Instead Celar shot wide, the visiting support cackling from the other end at his misfortune.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/qpr-stoke-championship-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In one wartime image, Winston Churchill is portrayed as a dragonslayer; in another, a gun-toting gangster. Later, he appears old and dejected, overdue for retirement. The cartoons, on show in a new exhibition at the Imperial War Museum London, show a multitude of Churchills, reflecting how he was seen in different countries and at different times, from 1909 onwards. “There was never a consensus view of him,” says curator Kate Clements. “Some of the depictions were heavily critical and even grotesque”, while others “depict his determined nature and portray him as a British figurehead”. Clements hopes the exhibition will “add another layer to our visitors’ understanding of this complex individual” and show “how satirical cartoons played a part in shaping perceptions of Churchill during his lifetime and beyond”.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.iwm.org.uk/events/churchill-in-cartoons-satirising-a-statesman">Churchill in Cartoons: Satirising a Statesman is at the Imperial War Museum, L

<p>Britons are picking porchscaping over puddings but will the Royal Mint’s silver sixpence feed a revival?</p><p>The last Sunday before Advent used to be spent toiling in the kitchen over a Christmas pudding but the nation’s changing habits mean that this weekend many will instead be heaving giant props and lights into place to turn their front door into a winter wonderland.</p><p>Doorscaping, or porchscaping, will be commonplace on many streets, according to those in the festive know, with the decor term going viral on TikTok and Pinterest. Big retailers such as Habitat, B&amp;Q and Amazon are among those selling “Christmas door sets”, which consist of two pre-lit trees, a garland and a wreath. Outsized garlands, bows and kitsch neon signs are among the other dressings designed to wow neighbours and passersby.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/nov/23/doorscaping-stir-up-sunday-christmas-traditions-silver-sixpence">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A castle in the Carpathian mountains with a turbulent history has been restored by the original family owners</p><p>The Zabola estate’s wrought-iron gates swing open and an avenue of chestnut trees stretches before me. Beyond them lies a serene Transylvanian landscape of rolling hills, lakes and gardens surrounding a&nbsp;grand yellow-ochre castle (which has the comfiest beds I’ve ever slept in). I&nbsp;instantly feel myself relax – this place, hidden in a forested valley in Romania’s Carpathian mountains, is a&nbsp;dreamy oasis for a winter weekend, and somewhere I have been before for&nbsp;proper R&amp;R.</p><p>In past centuries, people from all over the Austro-Hungarian empire, of&nbsp;which the region of Covasna, surrounding Zabola village and castle were once part, came here to heal. The&nbsp;area, above a dormant volcano (last eruption: 20,000 years ago), has bubbly mineral springs below the surface but was never as famous as the spas of Bad Gastein in Austria or Karlovy Var

## Ren Faire: a mind-boggling tale that’s like Succession, with added jesters and jousts

<p>This wild documentary about George ‘King’ Coulam’s renaissance festival in Texas – and the search for an heir to his throne – will make your whole body cringe. What a strange and wonderful gift, my liege!</p><p>A hearty endorsement from me this week, when the lauded-in-the-US-and-only-available-here-after-many-many-months three-parter Ren Faire comes to Sky Documentaries (Friday, 9pm). It is almost impossible to describe this show – in which a self-appointed “King” of the US’s longest-running renaissance fayre tries to find the right person to take over before he dies – without mentioning another HBO show in which an old man who pulses with impenetrable anger and weird horniness chooses someone to take over his job, and I have read a lot of coverage of it that hasn’t even tried. So I’m not going to, either: bit like Succession, isn’t it?</p><p>Ren Faire focuses on the power struggle beneath George Coulam, the octogenarian self-described visionary who created the Texas Renaissance

<p>The talks in Azerbaijan have seen nations at odds over how much money developed countries should provide to poorer ones</p><p>As we wait for the new text to land it’s worth looking back at the closing summary from yesterday, when the conference should have ended.</p><p>Yesterday’s closing summary:</p><p>Mary Robinson, the former president of Ireland and twice a UN climate envoy, said rich country budgets were stretched amid inflation, Covid and conflicts including Russia’s war in Ukraine, and warned that poorer countries might have to compromise.</p><p>The UK government pledged £239m to tackle deforestation</p><p>In an unusual intervention, the UAE stepped in and warned that the world must stand behind a historic resolution made last year to “transition away from fossil fuels” as the Saudis tried to block the language.</p><p>The draft text was published, but met a pretty hostile reception. It called for $1.3tn by 2035.</p><p>Civil society called it “an absolute embarrassment”</p><
