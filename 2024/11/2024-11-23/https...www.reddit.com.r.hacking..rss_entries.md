<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m on Windows, with RDP exposed externally to the internet through port forwarding, because I need to remote into my home computer from outside my home. I currently do not use the default RDP 3389 port. Event viewer shows around 100 login failures per second, coming from many different IP addresses, all attempting different usernames. the usernames are common like &quot;michael&quot; and I guess they are trying to brute force. Sometimes, my connection feels slow, maybe as a result of a surge of incoming requests acting like a Denial of Service.</p> <p>Is there a way to set up the windows firewall so that my server will stop responding to these attempts? Can it be done in a way where I can still RDP to my server with the correct username / password? Is there a way to automatically block ip address after 3 bad attempts?</p> <p>I saw an Inbound Rule option in the firewall for Authorized Computers. Is this something I can use?

## How to automate Wi-Fi disconnection after finding valid credentials during brute force on Android?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m performing a brute force attack using Hydra on Android to find credentials in a captive portal. Every time I find valid credentials, the system automatically connects to the network, which prevents me from continuing to test the next credentials without disconnecting first.</p> <p>My goal is to automate the disconnection process so that Hydra can keep testing without interruptions. Disabling Wi-Fi alone doesn’t completely solve the issue, as I need to forget the network or click the &#39;disconnect&#39; button on the portal.</p> <p>Some ideas I’ve considered:</p> <ol> <li><p>Automating the disconnection using scripts in Termux.</p></li> <li><p>Switching IPs for each new user tested.</p></li> <li><p>Creating a script to interact with the logout page on the portal.</p></li> </ol> <p>Has anyone faced a similar issue or has practical suggestions? Tools, scripts, or even different approaches would be very helpful! Thanks</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &
