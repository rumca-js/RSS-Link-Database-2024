It is amazing how Hanya could write such a deep character but I wouldn’t recommend this book to anyone who is dealing with mental issues.</p> <p>You truly have to be inhumanly strong to read this book until it’s final page.

## Why do so many people think they can write better than published authors?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This is a bit of a random rant. Something I see all the time, especially online, really irks me: people claiming they can write better than [insert popular author here]. It’s usually directed towards bestselling writers or someone whose book is trending, and the comments are always along the lines of—“I could write better than this in my sleep.”, etc</p> <p>Here’s the thing: no, you probably can’t. I’ve read writing on platforms like Wattpad, and even the best stuff is often… not great. Writing something readable isn’t that easy. Even experienced writers struggle to turn out something consistently good, let alone something worth publishing. And that’s not even getting into the editing, pacing, character development, and narrative arcs that make a book actually readable.</p> <p>As someone who writes for fun, I get how you can write a chapter and think, “Wow, I could totally do this!” Writing a single chapter or an essay for some course you’re taking i

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This has been another year where i thought i’ll read a lot but couldn’t. But one thing I did different this year was try to document at different points of time how i’m feeling towards that goal. I started a blog page. Readingthroughmonotony.pages.dev</p> <p>That kind of helps me in remembering my motivations and keep track of what happened to keep me from reading, and more importantly what did I actually read that i didn’t count . It is slowly becoming a life journal though. Anyways, I wanted to share it somewhere and share my most recent takeaways that should improve my reading.</p> <ol> <li>For long novels like with any work of neal stephenson, i’d create a companion notebook to help me keep track of events and characters so that I know the context when i pick it back up in a while.</li> <li>For reading something new, like academically learning, make a course like structured plan otherwise I don’t think I’ll retain anything.</li> <li>Make extensiv

I hear there has been some criticism (I hope I’m wrong), but the erosion of rights of highly educated women and the lengths they go to discuss literature (and my favorite book, Lolita). It touches on American interference in Iran’s politics, Iranian countering with extremism, and ultimately, the impediments the women face in making any progress toward a future where great literature and the culture that results from it is seemingly impossible.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Last night I dreamed about a book called &quot;Eleanor&quot; (the quote marks were in the title). In the dream it was the book that the movie Paper Towns was based on (I&#39;ve never seen it) but was supposedly so much better and weirder than the movie. It was about this girl who lived with her parents in Massachusetts and weird stuff happens, particularly involving her pet bird. I remember flipping through it and all the page numbers were screwed up and out of order, which I think is just because of how dreams work, but I remember thinking it was really cool. I was excited to read it but now I&#39;m annoyed it doesn&#39;t exist. Also after that dream I had a false waking up dream in which I&#39;d slept in and missed a whole week including Thanksgiving. </p> <p>Anyways just curious if anyone&#39;s dreamed up any nonexistent books, and whether you would want to read them. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.c

Among others I&#39;ve read:</p> <p>Into Thin Air</p> <p>K2</p> <p>Under the banner of heaven</p> <p>The Wager</p> <p>They were all very good, but all 3 of these come with a big flaw.

I have a habit of not reading blurbs or other marketing material, so besides knowing that The Wager is about a ship or Into Thin Air is about Mt.

I didn&#39;t finish this book, DNF&#39;d at exactly 45%, the part after our narrator ran down with a girl and had sex.</p> <p>I would like to clarify, these are my own opinion and perspectives on the book, and if you disagree then good for you. I know many people say our narrator is simply the filthy misogyny and the author has to do nothing with it, these people implying that Dazai himself is not, okay, fine, if you believe that, then that&#39;s okay, I dont have any problems. I also know that he wrote a book with a female protagonist and that perhaps will shed some light on the entire &quot;is the author misogynist or simply the characters&quot;, that&#39;s great but I choose to not read anything from him now. Also, if that says anything, I am a man.</p> <p>So, I would love to start sharing my thoughts now. Trust

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I just finished S. A. Cosby&#39;s <em>Razorblade Tears</em> and really enjoyed it!</p> <p>It&#39;s about two violently flawed, but loving fathers coming to terms with how they mistreated their gay sons, and working together to seek vengeance on the people who murdered their sons. I was hesitant to start it because I thought it would be trauma porn, but I&#39;m really glad I read it. While there is a lot of trauma and a lot of grief, the characters accept the mistakes as the past they can&#39;t fix, and focuses on the problems they can fix in the present. There&#39;s this constant forward momentum to the book that makes it very engaging, and almost hopeful.</p> <p>The book is not without fault. While I absolutely, completely, unreservedly, 100% agree with Cosby&#39;s views on systematic racism, class privilege, and the mistreatment of people in the LGBTQ+ community, he is heavy handed with the message, sometimes to the point of breaking the narrative&

I wanted to read his books in order of publication, and so far for me, every book is better than the last. </p> <p>I loved Suttree, and when read Blood Meridian twice and took a break from McCarthy, thinking that it didn&#39;t get much better than Blood Meridian.
