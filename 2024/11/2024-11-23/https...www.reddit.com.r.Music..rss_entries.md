<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been listening to a lot of Roxy Music lately and I&#39;d love to find female-fronted bands/artists that have a similiar vibe. I love weird voices (Bryan Ferry, David Byrne, David Bowie) - those people wouldn&#39;t think of as typical &#39;singers&#39; - but as a female singer myself, I&#39;d like to find more female artists to cover. Kate Bush is probably the closest example I can think of to the type of artists I&#39;m looking for, and I love her. Any suggestions? Thanks.</p> <p>Edit: Abigail Morris (The Last Dinner Party) is another suggestion that&#39;s perfect for the kind of voices I&#39;m looking for. Thanks for your suggestions so far!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Mouseylouse"> /u/Mouseylouse </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1gy9ne5/weird_female_voices_please/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1gy9ne

The religious folks are singing it in Gospel, and the non-religious folks are laughing at them.</p> <p>Personally, it&#39;s very clear that the song has sexual undertones. From what I&#39;ve read, this was purposeful. She gave the song the double entendres to make a statement. </p> <p>What I&#39;m wondering is if anyone has any in-depth sources of Madonna talking about the lyrics/creation of this song? I have yet to find anything about her talking specifically of the sexual undertones in the song. I can only seem to find bits and pieces.
