This week on Ben After Dark, the winning continues, as Donald Trump is more popular than a McDonald's Happy Meal in a room full of kids. Joe Biden disappears into the jungle flora, perhaps never to return‚Ä¶just like Ellen Page. Ben breaks down Trump‚Äôs UFC power squad, RFK Jr.‚Äôs initiation into the fast food hall of fame, and Cabinet picks so spicy they‚Äôre giving liberals indigestion. Over at MSNBC, Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski are caught in a flip-flop so epic, they've lost more viewers than a YouTube video watching paint dry, and the latest Diddy Watch. Grab your Big Mac and Diet Coke; this one‚Äôs greasy, messy, and delicious.

Ben discusses the recent backlash at 'Morning Joe' for meeting with President Trump. It is because of this that MSNBC‚Äôs morning show viewership is dwindling. Rosie O‚ÄôDonnell took to social media, ripping into him. He also talks about the recent UN conference where Alex Murray stated the need for full-scale censorship on climate issues and democratic regulation of the First Amendment. Additionally, Elon Musk talks more about DOGE‚Äôs plan to push back against the rules and regulations promulgated by unelected bureaucrats.
