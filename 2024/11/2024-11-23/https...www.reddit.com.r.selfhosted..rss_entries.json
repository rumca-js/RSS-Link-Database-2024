I recently out of nowhere had it stop working, it seems to work when I localhost but I can\u2019t figure out why it\u2019s all of a sudden not working outside my network. I did run a apt update the other day and can\u2019t recall if caddy changed how they had their Caddyfile or something but I\u2019ve been trying to fix this for the last like 5 hours and now i\u2019m just asking around, any knowledge on this kind of networking is appreciated.
