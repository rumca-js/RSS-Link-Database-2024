I&#39;ve searched around the internet but I can&#39;t find any mod that adds blood. I wonder if it&#39;s because the law in China has banned much explicit content. If it doesn&#39;t exist, is there any good man who can express this desire of mine?</p> <p>Ultimately it doesn&#39;t seem too difficult to make, sure, I have no experience in creating mods, but even just having red visual effects when someone gets hit would already be a step forward.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/_MrTaku_\"> /u/_MrTaku_ </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/GameMods/comments/1gxvspv/is_there_a_mod_that_adds_visual_blood_to_genshin/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/GameMods/comments/1gxvspv/is_there_a_mod_that_adds_visual_blo", "id": 1571051, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/GameMods/comments/1gxvspv/is_there_a_mod_that_adds_visual_blood_to_genshin", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 533, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/GameMods/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Is there a mod that adds visual blood to Genshin Impact?", "vote": 0}]
