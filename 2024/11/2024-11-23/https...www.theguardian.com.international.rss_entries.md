Money. Discovering that Nemorino, poor, dull and lampooned, is an heir, they throw themselves at him. Not the point of Donizetti’s 1832 romantic comedy, but a sharp insight into base human nature in a work that dices with cruelty. The elixir of the title is at once a trick peddled by a quack and true love itself, wherever it falls. In a new production by Harry Fehr, conducted by Teresa Riveiro Böhm – each making ENO debuts – Italian village life has been transposed to second world war England in 1943. To complicate the timeframe, all is presented, redundantly, as a 1970s sitcom complete with op

<p><strong>London Chamber Ensemble<br>(Somm)</strong><br>Lost on a train and reconstructed, Herbert Howells’s youthful String Quartet No 3 is paired with the String Quartet No 6 by his teacher, Charles Wood</p><p>The story of Herbert Howells’s string quartet, called “In Gloucestershire”, is one of repeated mishap and recomposition over several years. In essence, his first effort, which he wrote as a young man in the summer of 1916, was lost on a train journey between Lydney (his birthplace) and Gloucester. Eventually a later version became his Quartet No 3, but an earlier attempt, from 1920, was found and reconstructed. This is the version performed here.</p><p>A lyrical mood, with echoes of Ravel’s String Quartet (1903), especially in the short scherzo, is mixed with folk-dance pastoralism.

 That work is the only one I’ve ever written that I never allowed to be reprinted in book form. To put it another way, I just wasn’t satisfied with the story. I thought its theme was very important but unfortunately I lacked the writing skills at the time to convey it in the way I’d hoped to. I decided to bide my time, until I’d acquired the necessary skill set as a writer, and only then do a complete rewrite of the story.</p><p>In the interim, though, I had lots of other wor

<p>Kick off the festive celebrations with this cranberry-glazed spatchcocked duck with bricks of cheesy onion stuffing</p><p>The older I get, the more I find myself leaning into tradition. There’s just something so comforting about a list of ingredients that stays pretty much the same year in, year out – save, of course, for the odd variation depending on the occasion – and that applies to Thanksgiving as much as it does to Christmas. That’s not to say we need to cook the same thing every year – far from it. I prefer to look at it as playing within certain fixed parameters, which not only feels safe and cosy, but also guarantees deliciousness. All reasons to give thanks, for sure.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/nov/23/yotam-ottolenghi-thanksgiving-roast-spiced-duck-and-stuffing-biscuits-recipes">Continue reading...</a>

Nobody is more interested in this topic than Ukraine,” a senior official told the Guardian.</p><p>“But the problem is, for the moment, everything is just speculation. Will it be the first peace plan, the second plan, the first variant, the 10th variant?” they said.
