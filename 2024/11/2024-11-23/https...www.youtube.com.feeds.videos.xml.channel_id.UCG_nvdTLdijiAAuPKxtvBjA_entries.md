Megalopolis is a new big-budget, wannabe blockbuster about building a city of the future. Maybe. It's a whole lot more too and it's a bit hard to summarize. What is easy to summarize, though, is that the movie became a massive flop, making back only a tiny portion of its $100+ million budget. And that's because it's a movie that could never appeal to modern general audiences. So in today's anatomy of a failure, let's see why that is and how we can avoid the same blockbuster pitfalls.
