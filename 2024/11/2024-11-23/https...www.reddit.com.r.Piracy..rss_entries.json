Updated RDT client from RD to Torbox </p> <p>It adds the downloads to TB and finishes the downloads. </p> <p>All I am seeing on my host is the folders. Nothing inside them. </p> <p>Does TB require different settings to download to host? Worked fine with RD, but now nothing seems to download to host. </p> <p>Thanks in advance !</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Infyx\"> /u/Infyx </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1gy05vw/rdtclient_not_downloading_to_host/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1gy05vw/rdtclient_not_downloading_to_host/\">[comments]</a></span>", "id": 1572434, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1gy05vw/rdtclient_not_downloading_to_host", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 530, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "RDT-client not downloading to host", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "author": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-11-23T11:34:36+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hello000 fellow pirates! </p> <p>I&#39;m looking for a way to download my spotify playlist in lossless high quality (FLAC format), not neccesarily from spotify, because best they offer is 320kbps.

I understand that I need the arr suite but I dont know where to begin, what OS to have on Rpi, etc. I have a 32GB sd card and a 0.5Tb SSD attached to the pi, I think that&#39;s enough for my media needs. </p> <p>I&#39;ve looked at other posts regarding this but I only understood a little and the info was old. Could someone point me in the direction of where to get started? Any guides, tips or general info is much appreciated. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/KillStelios\"> /u/KillStelios </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1gxmvhj/looking_for_direction_to_use_rpi_4b_8gb_as_a/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1gxmvhj/looking_for_direction_to_use_rpi_4b_8gb_as_a/\">[comments]</a></span>", "id": 1569966, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1gxmvhj/looking_for_direction_to_use_rpi_4b_8gb_as_a", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 530, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Looking for direction to use Rpi 4B 8GB as a media centre", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "author": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-11-23T00:27:10+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;m really new to this whole thing so please make replies easy to understand.</p> <p>I looked at many posts but most of them were about torrenting which I don&#39;t care about at this point, but how does it look with streaming, I mean adblock and antivirus ofc but can one be busted by not using a VPN and if one would stream (not download) without VPN is it too late to start using one?</p> <p>Also Which country should be picked for the VPN?</p> <p>I hope Throw away accounts are allowed here since I don&#39;t want this on my main account.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/WraithTTV69\"> /u/WraithTTV69 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1gxmttg/how_save_is_streaming_in_germany_not_torrenting/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1gxmttg/how_save_is_streaming_in_germany_not_torrenting/\">[comments]</a></span>", "id": 1569967, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1gxmttg/how_save_is_streaming_in_germany_not_torrenting", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 530, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "How save is streaming in germany (not torrenting)", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "author": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-11-23T00:17:00+00:00", "description": "<table> <tr><td> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1gxmm2w/rd_was_nice_as_long_as_it_lasted/\"> <img src=\"https://preview.redd.it/3uyjatygnj2e1.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c1f6dbebdceb8a21897081d82201d60d9890f873\" alt=\"RD was nice as long as it lasted...\" title=\"RD was nice as long as it lasted...\" /> </a> </td><td> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/robin_888\"> /u/robin_888 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://i.redd.it/3uyjatygnj2e1.png\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1gxmm2w/rd_was_nice_as_long_as_it_lasted/\">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>", "id": 1569968, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1gxmm2w/rd_was_nice_as_long_as_it_lasted", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 530, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://preview.redd.it/3uyjatygnj2e1.png?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=c1f6dbebdceb8a21897081d82201d60d9890f873", "title": "RD was nice as long as it lasted...", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "author": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-11-23T00:15:41+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hey guys, I&#39;m planning on overhauling my Plex media library for black friday. Right now, I&#39;m using a 2TB MyCloud Home storage device that has a Plex media server installed, but it&#39;s kind of.. bad. Constantly buffering and I&#39;ve reached the point where only a teeny bit of 2TB storage isn&#39;t enough for my needs. With that being said, I&#39;ve decided to go for a Healuck 4 Bay NAS MiniPC (N100 processor) on Amazon, currently 20% off.<br/> I&#39;ll be collecting many 4K movies and I&#39;m considering looking into and learning about the &quot;arr&quot; applications, so I&#39;d like to be able to include this in my build. According to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKTClZTfVOE\">this Youtube video reviewing this product</a>, it includes OpenMediaVault as the base OS, which I think I&#39;d like to stick with. There won&#39;t be many users on this server, as it will only be shared with 2 or 3 family members and a couple of friends.", "id": 1569969, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1gxml3l/my_plex_plan_will_this_work", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 530, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "My Plex Plan - Will this work?", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "author": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-11-23T00:08:42+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;m not a coder.
