Working with week-old zebrafish larva, researchers decoded how the connections formed by a network of neurons in the brainstem guide the fishes' gaze. The study found that a simplified artificial circuit, based on the architecture of this neuronal system, can predict activity in the network. In addition to shedding light on how the brain handles short-term memory, the findings could lead to novel approaches for treating eye movement disorders.

## Cooking up a breakthrough: Engineers refine lipid nanoparticles for better mRNA therapies

Engineers have cooked up a new way to improve mRNA delivery, developing an optimal 'recipe' for ionizable lipids -- key ingredients in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), the molecules behind the COVID-19 vaccines and other innovative therapies. The method mirrors the iterative process of developing a culinary dish and may lead to safer, more effective mRNA vaccines and therapeutics.

## Standing at work can be detrimental to blood pressure

A new study found that prolonged standing at work had a negative impact on the research participants' 24-hour blood pressure. In contrast, spending more time sitting at work was associated with better blood pressure. The study suggests that activity behavior during working hours may be more relevant to 24-hour blood pressure than recreational physical activity.

Some sequences in the genome cause genes to be switched on or off. Until now, each of these gene switches, or so-called enhancers, was thought to have its own place on the DNA. Different enhancers are therefore separated from each other, even if they control the same gene, and switch it on in different parts of the body. A recent study challenges this idea. The findings are also important because gene switches are thought to play a central role in evolution.
