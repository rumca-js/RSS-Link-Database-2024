Generic programming, better known in C++ as templates, can feel daunting and overwhelming to those unfamiliar with the paradigm. This Back to Basics talk will explain the foundations of C++ templates, covering the language rules that must be understood in order to work with template code effectively.  I will provide some guidelines for how to use templates and how to write templates.

While you won't come away from this being an expert in template metaprogramming--that's an impossible task for any hour-long presentation--you should have a strong enough foundation that you can correctly maintain template code while you develop your expertise in generic programming over time.

This talk is designed for those who are learning C++ and want an introduction to templates and generic programming.  It will also be useful for experienced C++ developers who haven't mastered templates yet and wan
