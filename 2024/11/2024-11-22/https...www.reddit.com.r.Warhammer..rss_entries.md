So far bone colour is the best I&#39;ve got to tie to the pallid, dry flesh and bone of the draugr, but I feel like i need to work more grey and metal in, like stone and armour, but then should I just go full golem and make them entirely grey and metallic?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi ! </p> <p>I need advice regarding a gift for my new boyfriend, who loves Warhammer. The thing is that I know absolutely NOTHING about the lore, the merch, etc.</p> <p><strong>All I know is that he loves Humans/Humankind (among other things, but it seemed like he liked them the most) and that he loves figurines (he used to collect them when he was younger).</strong> </p> <p>He never really described in detail what he loves about Warhammer and its lore (scared to bore me, I assume ?), and we haven&#39;t been together for very long (barely a month) so I didn&#39;t get the chance to get more information from him. The problem is that his birthday is coming soon (1st December) and I&#39;m getting overwhelmed with this whole thing. I tried to ask questions about it, but he was confused as to why I was suddenly interested in it so I stopped pressing the subject (I don&#39;t want to ruin the surprise).</p> <p>There are three official Warhammer shops in my

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>From what I understand about warhammers lore we don&#39;t really see any species develop psykers. For humanity it seems like it just kind of happened on it&#39;s own during the Dark Age of Technology but there aren&#39;t exacts of how it went down. While for other species like the Eldar and Orks, they were literally just made with them in the first place so there wasn&#39;t a process to them, they just had the powers already.</p> <p>On that note, I think it starts to make more sense on how they manage to control the other Tau. The Emperor basically does the same thing. He also uses his overwhelming powers to influence the people around him but what if the Ethereals are doing that but in a less obvious why? Perhaps they know that tapping too hard into the warp is dangerous or in typical Tau fashion, simply don&#39;t even understand the truth depths of the warp. So they basically use very base line warp manipulation to just conjure pheromones instead o
