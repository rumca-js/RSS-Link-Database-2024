Hubble Space Telescope’s recent observations of FU Orionis have revealed surprising new details about the star’s accretion disk. The study found that the disk’s inner edge reaches temperatures as high as 16,000K, nearly three times hotter than the Sun’s surface. This discovery challenges existing models of stellar accretion, which had predicted lower temperatures. FU Orionis, a young eruptive star, has been observed undergoing dramatic changes since 1936, with its accretion disk touching its surface due to instability. These findings provide valuable insights into the early stages of star formation and the dynamics between young stars and their disks. The study also has significant implications for planet formation, particularly for planets forming close to the star.

A recent study proposes that advanced alien civilisations might utilise binary star systems, especially those involving neutron stars, as massive interstellar spacecraft. By ejecting material in specific directions, the stars could generate thrust, moving the system across the galaxy. Known hypervelocity stars with unusual accelerations are suggested as worth investigating. Although the theory is hypothetical and unverified, it raises intriguing possibilities about extraterrestrial engineering.

A supernova within the Milky Way could revolutionise dark matter research by producing gamma rays from axions, elusive particles theorised to exist during a star's core collapse. Scientists at UC Berkeley are calling for gamma-ray telescopes to monitor the sky, ensuring readiness for the next nearby supernova. Such an event could confirm the axion's mass and properties, transforming our understanding of the universe's unseen matter. However, current detection efforts rely heavily on the chance alignment of the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope.
