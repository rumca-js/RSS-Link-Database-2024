Holy crap, this book is awesome! The title made it sound so mundane, like every other romance-obsessed kinda urban fantasy\u2026but that is wrong, like all wrong.

And it\u2019s funny, too. Definitely one of the most fun, interesting, action packed, funny urban fantasies I have encountered since my last Jim Butcher novel. Most urban fantasy these days is just lacking something, but this one has <em>got</em> it! Seriously, give it a shot\u2014in spite of the title.
