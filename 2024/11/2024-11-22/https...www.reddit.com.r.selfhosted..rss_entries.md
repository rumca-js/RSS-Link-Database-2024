<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi All, over time, without much thining, I&#39;ve found myself going down the rabbit hole of self-hosting using a Synology 920+ and a Raspberry Pi 4. It started as a hobby, but now I&#39;m looking at a jungle of docker containers — 26, according to Portainer (SIgh). I definitely need to get rid of the ones I&#39;m not using anymore.</p> <p>I&#39;ve just got a Pi 5, and I’m considering adding a mini PC to ramp things up. This sparked a realisation that I&#39;ll need to transfer my setup over. While I&#39;m not too concerned about moving data like my Plex/Jellyfin media, I&#39;m really keen to streamline and automate the whole process.</p> <p>Does anyone have tips on how to start automating the migration of docker containers? Is there a straightforward way to pull all the configurations from Portainer into one big automation file? Also, my Pi 4 currently handles NPM and routes domains to the correct containers and it has about 18 different domain confi

I&#39;m considering moving my *arr stack, including Jellyfin, out of the cloud, as it needs lots of bandwidth and at least 200gb when downloading big movies or season packs before they&#39;re offloaded to the smb storage, which is a monthly cost i could avoid.

Though i do have the performance for hosting streaming from inside my home network, my outbound network speed is not that great, and that&#39;s one of the main reasons i&#39;ve been using a VPS, so i can easily stream externally. I wanted to ask if it was possible to have the full arr stack with jellyseerr, jellyfin, prowlarr, radarr, sonarr, qbittorrent etc. on my home server connected to the hetzner storage box, that i use when im at home, while also having a second instance of just jellyfin connected to the storage running on a small vps (e.g. i have free digital ocean credits) for when i need external access?

But then I&#39;ve also seen Hostinger are offering 67% off for a seemingly higher spec KVM8 again for 2 yrs at $19.99/month, 8 vcpu, 32gig ram, 400 nvme storage 32TB bandwidth, 300mbps.</p> <p>I&#39;ve compared these packages on a well known comparison site and there seems to be more As and Bs allocated to the OVH setup compared to Hostinger but it&#39;s a mix. OVH seem to rank in top 15 vps hosts, Hostinger lower down. </p> <p>Are the higher numbers just marketing, I don&#39;t really need so much space I use about 40 at present don&#39;t think will use the full 8 ram at OVH as have 4ram currently and it&#39;s mostly fine but I do have a 2 vcpu which is always suffering at a managed VPS service costing me $46 a month. The 2gbps OVH appears better. I&#39;ll be running mainly about 30 lowish traffi
