In fact, she frequently raised complaints about her contribution in the compositions being undermined or unrecognized... But, apart from this fact, I can&#39;t find anything that can prove Yma sumac as a composer with its own style and works. If you have any information about this topic, please, share in the comments!</p> <p>I&#39;ll watch the only documentary that i found to be related to this matter: i&#39;ll link it here, if you wanna check it out.</p> <p><a href="https://youtu.be/shsUOqtu1Rw?si=zCXYuM6wojbsmpn6">https://youtu.be/shsUOqtu1Rw?si=zCXYuM6wojbsmpn6</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Contrapuntobrowniano
