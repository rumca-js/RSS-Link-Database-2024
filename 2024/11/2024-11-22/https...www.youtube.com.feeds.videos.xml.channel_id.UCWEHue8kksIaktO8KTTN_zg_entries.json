In this course we fine-tune the amazing Flux open-source image generation AI model.\n\nTo make this happen, we use Replicate's AI services to train and fine-tune Flux with our data. You can upload about 12 images of yourself and automagically have an AI tool like Midjourney with your data. It's incredible. The best part? It costs about $3 USD to fine-tune this model then about $0.05 to generate images with it using Replicate's GPUs.\n\nOnce you have a fine-tuned model, we need a reliable way to access it without racking up bills. Enter FastAPI. We create our own API service that we can call at anytime to generate our images. I'm shocked how good image generation is with our own data!\n\nTopics include:\n- Compressing and optimizing images\n- Creating zip files from local folders\n- Building a FastAPI Microservice\n- Implementing Rate Limiting with Upstash Redis\n- Creating a Proxy Service for your custom fine-tuned Flux AI Model\n- Generat", "id": 1569563, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV82LDKT16A", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 74, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCWEHue8kksIaktO8KTTN_zg", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/lV82LDKT16A/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Let's build a AI Photo Generator with Python and FastAPI", "vote": 0}]
