								<p><strong>The Last of Us: Escape the Dark</strong> is an extremely rare thing for a board gamer like me. It’s a videogame adaptation that manages to do something different, <em>and</em> it’s a sequel to an existing game that meaningfully expands on the original mechanics. Not everyone will vibe with its luck-heavy cruelty, but as a lover of thematic and hard-hitting games, I’m a fan.</p>

								<p>Hasbro’s CEO Chris Cocks dropped an unexpected bombshell earlier in the week when he revealed that <strong>Magic: The Gathering</strong> was testing a new game that would allow players to access the popular multiplayer format Commander. The implication is that this is something Wizards would release separately to the existing MTG Arena videogame and mobile app.</p>

								<p>I’m currently running my home <strong>DnD </strong>group through the Turn of Fortune’s Wheel campaign, and - for reasons I won’t spoil in this introductory paragraph - by the start of session two, I <em>really</em> needed to kill at least one member of the party. Not wanting to interrupt the players exploring all the fun oddities of Sigil, the metropolis at the centre of the multiverse, with a sudden fight scene, I had to get creative - and so was born the interdimensional doomsday food festival.</p>

								<p>Games Workshop has advised investors that it will smash its revenue predictions for the quarter, and is on track to earn almost as much licensing revenue in the six months to December as it did in the entirety of the previous financial year. Though the firm hasn't provided any explanations for the unexpected boom, Wargamer believes the popularity of the videogame <strong>Space Marine 2</strong> is likely the cause.</p>
