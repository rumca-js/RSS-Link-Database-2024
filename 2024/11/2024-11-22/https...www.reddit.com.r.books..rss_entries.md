<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This book interested me because it falls under Steampunk (although there is more Biopunk here), and I like this direction of science fiction. In the end, I liked it. </p> <p>Let&#39;s start with the world of this book. The book takes place in the fictional world of Bas-Lag, or rather in the city of New Crobuzon. There are many areas with different creatures, from ordinary vodyanoi to cactus people. </p> <p>If looking at the book you think: &quot;Why is it so huge?&quot; Then here&#39;s the answer: The author likes to talk about his world. I&#39;m serious, China can spend a page describing the life of some area and who lives there, who has what religion. And that makes the world alive. </p> <p>The author also has a very rich imagination. Khepri, for example, are creatures with a human body and an insect instead of a head. Or redone? This is a real Cronenberg body horror. </p> <p>Now about the plot. </p> <p>Scientist Isaac receives an unusual client, n

## On November 22, 2008 I started keeping a journal of quotes/passages from books that I liked. My project turns 16 today and if you’re thinking of starting something like this - this is your sign to do it.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>It’s my birthday and as a treat I look over journals from previous years and delight in all of the passages and stories and quotes that I love. I can track how my thinking has changed - how I used to read memoirs and no longer do. How quotes I used to find insightful now feel tired (“I contain multitudes”) and how much quality stuff I read not at the right time but reading it now is the perfect time.</p> <p>I was hoping to post pictures of the journals but saw that this sub doesn’t allow it.</p> <p>Just wanted to encourage anyone who is thinking about doing something like this, start!

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I love the bookish community and have observed some key differences in it on different platforms, so thought I&#39;d share about my experience here.</p> <p>I have been a lifelong reader, but only discovered the online bookish community during the pandemic. It started with bookstagram. Unbeknownst to me, there was a whole subculture on Instagram of people reading books and posting about them, sharing book recs as well as beautiful photos of books. I eagerly set up my own bookstagram account in January 2021 and quickly got connected with many other book lovers.</p> <p>I was blown away by the depth of relationships I could form with people far away because we shared such similar interests. It was like finding my people, well into my 30s. I even met bookstagrammers in my same city that became some of my best friends in real life. I can honestly say that joining bookstagram changed my life!</p> <p>I’ve since joined the bookish community on other platforms

## Review: finished 48 Laws of Power and Meditations around the same time, these two books were awesome to read together.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I was a bit more attracted to Meditations and finished it first, meaning my brain is a bit more in &quot;48 laws&quot; mode since I spent the last couple weeks only reading that to finish up. I&#39;ll post the laws and talk a bit about thoughts on them.</p> <p>I&#39;m sure most of you are familiar with these two books, but for those who aren&#39;t - Marcus Aurelius was a Roman emperor who is well known for his journal entries on Stoicism. What I found very interesting was that Aurelius&#39; way of leading seemed relatively immune to most of the &quot;manipulative&quot; ways of the 48 laws, and the biggest key thing here is that Aurelius WAS a leader, and there most certainly were conniving and manipulative courtiers everywhere he went.</p> <p>That being said, there are a few things Greene points out in 48 laws that make me realize acting exactly as Aurelius says can really really piss people off and make them your enemy, when just a little &quot;s

I&#39;m genuinely curious about your experiences with authors who &quot;expand&quot; their initial trilogies or duologies. Was it a good move? I have to admit, it&#39;s a first for me.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>The way the author writes about identity and survival is incredible. I don’t think I’ve read anything else that captures modern Native life like this.

I loved how the pace picked up and the intensity built but I was hoping to see more of Blue interacting with her mom, or at least telling her about it. Still, I get that ending with a massacre is part of the point which makes it even more gut-wrenching.</p> <p>Out of all the characters, I loved Thomas Frank’s chapter.

Then the entire book is all about her timeline and everyone in her life, even if the chapter doesn&#39;t have her in it, everyone in the story is connected to her somehow. So why in the world doesn&#39;t the book end with her death, maybe even at her funeral? The book feels unfinished to me for that very thing and I wish there was one more chapter at least after she buries the picture at Isak&#39;s grave, maybe with it starting like other chapters where she&#39;s suddenly dead and we are at the funeral with Solomon, Mozasu, and Hansu just sitting there, idk.</p> <p>While there are a few reasons this book is a bit frustrating (but life is frustrating and maybe that&#39;s part of the point), the only thing I really hated was the way it ended.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Sometimes, a book&#39;s reputation precedes it so much that you wonder if it can ever live up to the hype. For me, <em>Lonesome Dove</em> not only lived up to my expectations—it far exceeded them.</p> <p>I bought the book ages ago but kept putting off reading it. Finally, after finishing <em>All the Pretty Horses</em> for the second time, I decided to dive in. I was on a serious Western kick, but I worried <em>Lonesome Dove</em> might feel lesser by comparison. I couldn’t have been more wrong. The two books are incomparable. While they both fall under the Western genre, comparing them feels like a disservice. They&#39;re just too different.</p> <p>This book is a true epic, and I mean that in every sense of the word. It gave me the same sweeping, awe-inspiring feelings I had while reading Ken Follett’s <em>The Pillars of the Earth</em> and <em>World Without End</em>. The scale is immense, the storytelling masterful, and the world so vivid it feels lik
