Disney has a sequel problem.  At this years D23 event, Disney announced their slate of upcoming movies for the 2025 season.  And to the shock of almost no one, they were mostly sequels to existing Disney properties.  With movies like Toy Story 5, Moana 2, Incredibles 3, Frozen 3, Zootopia 2, and many more, Disney seems to be spiraling in a pool of their own characters with no rescue in sight.  But how did Disney get here?  What happened to the creative powerhouse that gave us films like The Lion King, Snow White, and Aladdin?  All signs point to one man, former disgraced CEO, Bob Chapek.
