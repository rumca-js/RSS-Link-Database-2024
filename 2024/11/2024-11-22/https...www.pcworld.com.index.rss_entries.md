<p>Microsoft is positioning its contentious Recall feature for Windows 11 as a headline capability for Copilot+ laptops. So it’s kind of weird that when the previously delayed tool went live, it only did so for x64-based machines and not Arm-based Snapdragon laptops that made such a splash earlier this year. Well, if you have one of those, you can now try Recall via the Windows Insider program.</p>



<p>Microsoft <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2024/11/22/previewing-recall-with-click-to-do-on-copilot-pcs-with-windows-insiders-in-the-dev-channel/">just announced</a> that Recall, which records pretty much everything you do on Windows, is now available to Snapdragon-powered Copilot+ PCs. You’ll need to get on the Insider Program (a fancy title for a beta) and join the Dev Channel if you want to see what all the hubbub is about. Fortunately, 

## Tested: Intel Lunar Lake brings real gaming to thin, light laptops

<p>Intel’s new Lunar Lake hardware is a reflection of modern chip design. </p>



<p>It’s tempting to call it a “processor” or “CPU” — old habits die hard, after all — but it’s really a system-on-a-chip (SoC), both in terms of architecture and philosophy. The CPU cores are joined by integrated GPU cores, a neural processing unit (NPU), and even on-chip RAM. Also, unlike past Intel chips, Lunar Lake seems set on striking a balance between the three.</p>



<p>That’s keenly felt in Intel’s approach to Lunar Lake’s integrated graphics (iGPU). Building on the success of Intel Core Ultra, Intel’s new processors also offer Intel Arc graphics — but this time around, Intel has returned to providing each iGPU a name unique to its configuration, and the best version here is the Intel Arc 140V with eight Xe Cores and a max frequency of 2.05GHz.</p>

## This RTX 4060 Lenovo laptop deal is so good, you don’t need Black Friday

<p>If you’re waiting for Black Friday to score a powerful gaming laptop that won’t break your wallet, that deal is already here: <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/lenovo-loq-15-6-gaming-laptop-fhd-amd-ryzen-7-7435hs-with-16gb-memory-nvidia-geforce-rtx-4060-8gb-512gb-ssd-luna-grey/6578511.p?skuId=6578511">Best Buy has a Lenovo LOQ for just $700</a>. That’s 30 percent off its $1,000 MSRP, a phenomenal price for this RTX-powered machine.</p>



<p>Let’s start there, shall we? This would already be a pretty good price for an RTX 4050 laptop, but it’s an insane price for an RTX 4060 laptop. You just don’t see these going for $700, and this is a graphics card that’ll let you crank up your settings on all but the most demanding games.</p>



<p>And those graphics are going to sizzle on this 15.6-inch screen with 1080p resolution and 144Hz refresh rate. That mea

<p>One of the key benefits of a laptop is its everyday practicality. For road warriors, a laptop lets you take on the world wherever you are; for others, tethering your laptop to your desktop can be a great way to enhance your productivity or even your gaming experience.</p>



<p>But what if you mainly use your laptop at home, it’s pretty much <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2341922/how-to-use-an-external-monitor-with-a-gaming-laptop.html">always connected to an external monitor</a>, and you don’t really need the laptop screen? In that case, running your laptop in clamshell mode (i.e., with the screen closed) is a fantastic option. You’ll get to enjoy the larger display of a monitor <em>and</em> have better ergonomics to boot.</p>
