When stored together, quince enhance each other over time, and develop a richer flavour and colour. Also note that roasting and grinding the hazelnuts yourself will give the frangipane a deeper, more intense flavour compared with store-bought. And if you prefer almonds, feel free to use them instead.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/nov/22/quince-hazelnut-tart-recipe-ravneet-gill">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Pollution levels in the Indian capital have soared to their highest levels this year, forcing schools and offices to close and cloaking the city in thick brown smog. In some parts of the city, a live air quality ranking by IQAir put pollution levels at more than 30 times the maximum level deemed healthy. The catastrophic levels of pollution have led to numerous emergency measures, including most schools being closed and lessons moved online. The smog arrives annually as the weather in the north of India gets colder, trapping toxic pollutants from the tens of millions of cars on the road, as well as from rubbish fires, construction and factory emissions. Experts say the toxic air quality is reducing life expectancy in the city by an average of seven years</p><p></p><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/18/pollution-in-delhi-hits-record-high-cloaking-city-in-hazardous-smog">Pollution in Delhi hits record high, cloaking city in smog</a></p></li></ul> <a href=

His last, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/nov/03/michael-kiwanuka-kiwanuka-review">self-titled album</a> was an instant classic in 2019, a revelatory work perfectly assembled by layering orchestral soul and psychedelic rock over a bedrock of sublime, anthemic songwriting. With that credit banked aside a well-earned Mercury prize, he’s fashioned a more reticent collection. It waits for you to lean into it.</p><p>Floating Parade sets out the terms from the start.

The animation is stunning, with Maurice Sendak-style critter designs and intricate detail aplenty. And the songs – such as the samba extravaganza about adventurous eating – are actually memorable.

It is quite free-ranging in its scope, but is essentially about how witches and their history overlaps with postpartum depression on the one hand and psychosis on the other, all told through the filter of Sankey’s own experience. Looking straight into the camera, she explains how she was engulfed by anxiety and depression after the birth of her son in 2020 during the Covid pandemic; after several trips to A&amp;E and crisis moments, she ended up in a special psychiatric ward for mothers and children.</p><p>Sankey says she made it through thanks to therapy and support from other patients, which she likens to the formation of covens in witchcraft lore.

It is hardly a coincidence that his decision comes as the war approaches a likely endgame, with both sides jockeying for position ahead of negotiations in the shadow of Donald Trump.</p><p>Neither Ukraine nor Russia quite knows <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/06/ukraine-trump-victory">what Trump will do</a> when he takes office in January.

<p>Our tipsters wrap up warm and head to northern Europe, finding glacier lakes, frozen seas, snowy forests, reindeer herds and – happily – saunas and hot tubs</p><p>We booked a brilliant skating experience in the Stockholm archipelago with <a href="https://www.truenaturesweden.com/ice-skating-2-days">True Nature Sweden</a>. There are one-day guided tours for beginners and more experienced skaters (from 13 years upwards). Skating on the sea, or on lakes, feeling the wind blow (faster as you up your speed!) is truly exhilarating. The day starts with some training and a safety briefing. True Nature Sweden organises everything, including lunches made over open fires and <em>fika</em> (coffee and cake) at sunset. <br><strong>Asa</strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2024/nov/22/readers-favourite-nordic-scandinavia-winter-trips-skiing-hiking">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Made under dangerous conditions, this documentary charts how the lives of three women were turned upside down by Afghanistan’s overthrow in 2021</p><p>Afghan film-maker Sahra Mani, creator of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/oct/05/a-thousand-girls-like-me-review-a-brave-woman-refuses-to-bow-down">the rape-survivor documentary A Thousand Girls Like Me</a> from 2018, brought her camera to Kabul to chronicle Afghanistan’s fall to the Taliban in 2021 following America’s withdrawal. A strange mixture of amnesia and cross-party reticence means that this issue has not in fact featured much in postmortem discussions of the Biden/Harris administration. Women’s rights were immediately crushed by theocratic misogynists, and Afghanistan’s women cannot have been reassured by <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/08/liberal-democracy-worth-fight/619833/">the response from the western anti-war left</a>, notably the now notorious, breezily unconcerned tweet from G

<p>The story of former Amazon worker Karolina Sobczak reveals much about the people who keep our society running – at huge personal cost</p><p>If journalists visit Mansfield at all these days, they come for one thing: the cliches. They want the market town where 70% backed Brexit, the “red wall” seat that booted out its Labour MP in 2017 for a private-school boy who <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jan/16/ben-bradley-under-fire-for-blogpost-urging-jobless-people-to-have-vasectomies">called for the poor to be sterilised</a>. They want colliery brass bands, Nigel Farage’s beery grin and vox pops about stopping the boats. And they’re not alone. For social scientists and thinktankers, Mansfield and its ring of former mining villages make up a petri dish of “left-behind” England, of isolation and anger and impoverishment. They’re part of that other England, which performs the same role in our politics as the corrections and clarifications column in a daily broadsheet, sw
