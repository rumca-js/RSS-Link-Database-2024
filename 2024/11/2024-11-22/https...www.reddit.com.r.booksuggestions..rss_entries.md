So basically Percy Jackson with a higher lexile:) By fantasy mean - monsters, mythical creatures, magical abilities / super powers, By adventure I mean - going on quests, epic fight scenes, that stuff, By friendship I mean - explaining social hierarchies, what the main character thinks of people, forming a group of close friends, etc, By INNOCENT romance I mean - like how it is in Percy Jackson, little relationships, cute ships, a few kissing scenes, but nothing NSFW because my parents / teachers might be reading it:/ Thanks, have a good day/night!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/M0TH_h4s_p4wbz"> /u/M0TH_h4s_p4wbz </a> <br/> <span><a h

Lynn Painter’s books were alright but I wasn’t super into them either. </p> <p>I don’t mind light smut but I generally avoid it if I can since it doesn’t interest me. Unfortunately this leads to a lot of YA books being recommended but I’m in my 30s and like adult books and themes. I hope this isn’t too picky of a list, I’m just pretty bummed out that many romance books are all very cookie cutter lately. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Traditional-Net-8038"> /u/Traditional-Net-8038 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1gx0fhl/a_good_romance_book/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://

## Books on Imperial Russia's and the Soviet Union's plans to annex Tibet and Kashmir-why they couldn't?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>From what I have read, it seems that the British failure to properly demarcate Kashmir was mainly driven by fears of Russian expansion into Kashmir and Tibet, as well as concerns over a potential Russian presence in the Indian Ocean. In <em>The Northeast Question: Conflicts and Frontiers</em> by Pradip Phanjoubam, the author references several early 20th-century British documents that highlight these anxieties, even suggesting that Britain should entice China to take control of Tibet to curb Russian influence.</p> <p>However, I would like to explore this topic in greater depth, particularly from a Russian perspective. I’d appreciate any suggestions for books, research papers, or other resources that provide a more nuanced and structured analysis of these issues, especially those that reference official documents and archival information from the Western, Russian, Indian, and Chinese perspectives.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a h

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I want a book that’s similar in style, doesn’t need to be about war, I like the style of the authors books, specifically the two I have read, All Quiet On The Western Front and The Road Back. The author describes things with such bleak detail, and it really makes the book really interesting.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/GalacticAgronaut"> /u/GalacticAgronaut </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1gwv8h7/book_with_a_similar_tone_to_all_quiet_on_the/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1gwv8h7/book_with_a_similar_tone_to_all_quiet_on_the/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone! Anyone can suggest me a young adult book, that gives the same vibes of young women finding their way in life, being capable of having a life for themselves and self-sufficient but at the same time can be great in dating and relationships, the vibes of cosy glamorous fun and vibrant show of Gilmore Girls? Thank you!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Maynaaa"> /u/Maynaaa </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1gwuv4r/young_adults_book_that_gives_the_same_vibes_as/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1gwuv4r/young_adults_book_that_gives_the_same_vibes_as/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am just about done reading the Mistborn trilogy and have absolutely loved it. Would love some other lesser known (IE not LotR or Game of Thrones as I have read those) series to give a go. Any recommendations would be highly appreciated!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/L0wK3yNZ"> /u/L0wK3yNZ </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1gwurjs/what_to_read_after_the_mistborn_series/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1gwurjs/what_to_read_after_the_mistborn_series/">[comments]</a></span>
