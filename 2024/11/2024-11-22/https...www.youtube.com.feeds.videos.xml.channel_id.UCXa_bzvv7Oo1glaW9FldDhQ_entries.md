Launch issues aside, there's no doubt Asobo Studio's Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 is an absolutely massive experience. The prospect of flying anywhere on a much more detailed Earth than in the previous game, with new points of interest, even more airports, and detailed biomes, is already overwhelming enough.
