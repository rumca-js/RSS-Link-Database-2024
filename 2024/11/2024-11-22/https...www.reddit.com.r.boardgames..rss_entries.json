I have even went as far as to contact the creator (didn\u2019t respond) and a couple of board game influencers who promoted the game (not wanting to sell their copies). </p> <p>Y\u2019all, I am desperate. I\u2019m reaching out to the only place left. Does anyone in this community have the DELUXE version of Dreadful Meadows that they no longer want? I will buy it from you!!!
