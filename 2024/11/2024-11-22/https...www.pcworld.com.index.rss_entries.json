So it\u2019s kind of weird that when the previously delayed tool went live, it only did so for x64-based machines and not Arm-based Snapdragon laptops that made such a splash earlier this year. Well, if you have one of those, you can now try Recall via the Windows Insider program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Microsoft <a href=\"https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2024/11/22/previewing-recall-with-click-to-do-on-copilot-pcs-with-windows-insiders-in-the-dev-channel/\">just announced</a> that Recall, which records pretty much everything you do on Windows, is now available to Snapdragon-powered Copilot+ PCs. You\u2019ll need to get on the Insider Program (a fancy title for a beta) and join the Dev Channel if you want to see what all the hubbub is about.
