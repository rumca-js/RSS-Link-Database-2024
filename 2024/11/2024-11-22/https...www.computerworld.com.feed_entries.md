<p>OpenAI is reportedly thinking about developing its own browser with the aim of challenging Google’s dominance in the market, according to <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-considers-taking-on-google-with-browser" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Information</a>. The new browser would have built-in support for Chat GPT and Open AI’s search engine Search GPT.</p>



<p>OpenAI representatives have apparently held talks with developers from Conde Nast, Redfin, Eventbrite, and Priceline, but so far no agreements have been signed.</p>



<p>Shares of Google’s parent company Alphabet declined on the Nasdaq exchange after the browser plans became public, <a href="http

<p>Meta Quest 3 and Quest 3S headset owners will soon gain access to the “full capabilities” of Windows 11 in mixed reality, Microsoft announced at its <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3601006/microsoft-ignite-2024-get-the-latest-news-and-insights.html">Ignite conference</a> this week. </p>

<p>Once upon a time, we’d say software is eating the planet. It still is, but these days our world is being consumed by generative AI (genAI), which is seemingly <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3574222/ai-needs-apple-which-is-why-time-is-on-its-side.html">being added to everything</a>. Now, Apple’s Siri is on the cusp of bringing in its own form of genAI in a more conversational version Apple insiders are already calling “LLM Siri.”</p>

<p>The agents are coming, and they represent a fundamental shift in the role artificial intelligence plays in businesses, governments, and our lives.</p>



<p>The biggest news in agentic AI happened this month when we learned that OpenAI’s agent, Operator, is <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-13/openai-nears-launch-of-ai-agents-to-automate-tasks-for-users?embedded-checkout=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">expected to launch in January</a>.</p>



<p>OpenAI Operator will function as a personal assistant that can take multi-step actions on its own. We can expect Operator to be put to work writing code, booking travel, and managing daily schedules. It will do al

<p>For decades, the heart of every PC running Windows was an x86 processor, designed by Intel and later expanded upon by AMD with the x64 architecture. But in 2017, Microsoft released a version of Windows 10 that ran on processors built on designs from Arm, prompting some manufacturers to introduce Arm-based PCs.</p>



<p>Initially they had little influence on the market, but now Microsoft has really thrown its weight behind the Arm architecture. The Arm version o
