## Skytear Horde - I feel like I'm missing something; everyone says it's easy, but I'm getting stomped

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So, I mostly play vs. against my daughter (who always plays as the Horde), but I can&#39;t even imagine how it works solo...</p> <p>The main issue I&#39;m having is that it seems like it always takes more than one card to take down any given monster, but killing one monster only gives you one card, so you very quickly end up at a deficit of cards. On top of that, I often lose my best cards to random minion pillaging (you can counter that with Geurilla, but all the effort you spend on Geurilla-ing is effort you&#39;re not spending on taking out regular monsters/outsiders/the portal...)</p> <p>Just as a quick example, I was using the red deck against the nightmare deck. Daughter played &quot;Sand Chimera&quot;, which is 2 attack / 3 defense, and each Fight phase it reduces the attack of whatever it&#39;s engaged with by 1. Except for my heroes, all of my &quot;ally&quot; cards have less than 4 attack, so none of them could kill it on their own without

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all, do you have any recommendations for party games that are work appropriate and have a pretty short turnaround (5-10 mins per round)? I&#39;m hoping for something that is super easy to pick up, doesn&#39;t test intelligence or require you to accuse anyone of anything. Essentially trying to avoid people feeling dumb or uncomfortable playing with people they barely know. It&#39;ll be a station at an event, something that can help employees meet others in a fun environment. There&#39;ll be lots of other stuff going on too which is why I&#39;m looking for something people can jump in/out of relatively easily and quickly. </p> <p>Thanks in advance for your suggestions!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Penny_wish"> /u/Penny_wish </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1gxkrvy/short_workappropriate_party_games/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddi

The game’s difficulty ramps up as you progress, requiring strategic planning and communication to succeed. While it’s quick to learn, every playthrough feels tense and rewarding.

The Rangers team hasn&#39;t lost or even come close to losing yet. It seems like the main issue is the rangers zords allow them to just snowball into big damage after they flip, while the villains are based around chip damage, which just gets healed. </p> <p>We&#39;ve developed a few house rules to try and balance things out, but it doesn&#39;t seem like enough, so I was wondering if anyone else has tried to fix this and if so, what are your house rules for the game?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So my group have played a few rock solid hard games lately, both in coop and vs, and I was wondering if anyone could recommend a boardgame that as it progresses it let&#39;s you feel that you are getting stronger, or that you can do significantly more than you could at the start of the game? Like Wingspan for example, as the actions each develop, but perhaps slightly less randomness when it comes to cards available to get on your turn. We tend to like the medium to heavier games or those with a medium to longer length. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Lethimer"> /u/Lethimer </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1gxe132/power_fantasy/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1gxe132/power_fantasy/">[comments]</a></span>

What stands out about the game is that there was a book with pages that were split into 3 sections so that you could make different scenarios. It was a solo mode game, but I guess the standard 1 to 4 players possibly up to 6.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey me and my friends recently got the Gangs of Night City board game and it has been super fun! We normally play warhammer and the like so something less time intensive has been really enjoyable. We looked into buying the expansions but we only acquired the nomads and outcasts one.</p> <p>Does anyone know how to get the other expansions? Motorpool and the extra gangs is really cool, but so is the extra edge runners pack you can pick. I looked into the Kickstarter but I&#39;m worried I missed it all, we never messed around on it before so we are pretty clueless on this.</p> <p>Any help is appreciated!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/CrazyManSage"> /u/CrazyManSage </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1gwzx51/cyberpunk_gangs_of_night_city_bonus/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1gwzx51/cyberpunk_gangs_of_night_cit

They have so many that I could never get an exhaustive list but I do know that they have games like Catan, Dixit, Code Names, Ticket to Ride, etc. I also know that they really don&#39;t enjoy Monopoly!</p> <p>With that information, does anyone have recommendations of a newer board game that they might find fun? I say a newer one bc the chances of them owning it already is lower. Something around the $50-75 range.</p> <p>Thank you so much!!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SimplyEmojis"> /u/SimplyEmojis </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1gwzk3n/christmas_gift_75/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1gwzk3n/christmas_gift_75/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi Everyone! I have been looking for the game DREADFUL MEADOWS Deluxe Edition for a while now. I have looked everywhere! I’ve checked my local marketplace, local board game community, BGG Market (there is one available but it’s from out of the country and I don’t think I want to buy from a different country right now), eBay, Poshmark, Mercari. I have even went as far as to contact the creator (didn’t respond) and a couple of board game influencers who promoted the game (not wanting to sell their copies). </p> <p>Y’all, I am desperate. I’m reaching out to the only place left. Does anyone in this community have the DELUXE version of Dreadful Meadows that they no longer want? I will buy it from you!!!
