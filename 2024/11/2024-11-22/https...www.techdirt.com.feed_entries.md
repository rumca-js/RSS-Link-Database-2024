I rarely log into Facebook these days, but I happened to do so last week and was a bit surprised to see this pop up saying that an advertising post we had put up for the VPN service CyberGhost nearly a decade ago had to be removed: That’s a notice saying that Facebook had removed [&#8230;]

This is just what I needed to read after a post-election hell week or two. The city of Los Angeles has gone past exhaustion to vindictive irritation after being sued by the same cops it employs because it (legally) handed over photos and names of LAPD officers to journalist Ben Camacho. Ben Camacho then shared [&#8230;]

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton loves to preach about &#8220;free speech&#8221; and &#8220;free markets&#8221;—except, apparently, when it comes to his political allies. In a stunningly hypocritical and authoritarian move, Paxton has launched an &#8220;investigation&#8221; to bully advertisers who have chosen not to support Elon Musk&#8217;s troubled ExTwitter platform. This is a chilling attack on both [&#8230;]

There are two major reasons that the U.S. doesn’t pass an internet-era privacy law or regulate data brokers despite a parade of dangerous scandals. One, lobbied by a vast web of interconnected industries with unlimited budgets, Congress is too corrupt to do its job. Two, the U.S. government is disincentivized to do anything because it exploits this [&#8230;]

This stop may not have been all that pretextual &#8212; after all, the officer clocked the driver doing 69 mph in a 55 mph speed limit &#8212; but it swiftly turned pretextual for reasons the officer couldn&#8217;t competently explain. And that&#8217;s what cost the officer (and the prosecution) their evidence. Back in 2015, the Supreme [&#8230;]

Here we go again. Many years ago, we wrote about how one sports psychologist, Dr. Keith Bell, filed a copyright lawsuit against a college over a retweet. Specifically, the retweet included an image of a single page from Bell&#8217;s book, Winning Isn&#8217;t Normal. These suits are nonsense, of course, as a retweet is not the [&#8230;]
