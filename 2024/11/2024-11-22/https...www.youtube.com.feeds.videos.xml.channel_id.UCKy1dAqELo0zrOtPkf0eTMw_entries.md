In today's Daily Fix:
Leave it to Grand Theft Auto fans to come up with the craziest theories. The popular "moon theory" was recently debunked, however, as no new GTA 6 trailer has dropped. The theory suggests that Rockstar Games has been leaving hints as to when new trailers will drop via lunar clues in screenshots. One image released last year featured the moon in a particular lunar phase, and (likely coincidentally) the GTA 6 trailer dropped the day the real life moon was in the same phase. Didn't work this time, however. In other news, Black Ops 6 was a huge seller...on PlayStation. PS5 sales made up a whopping 82% of the game's sales, but it did move the needle on Game Pass subscriptions on Xbox and PC. And finally, Black Myth: Wukong developer Game Science is teasing something for the end of the year.

Paramount made a SEGA GENESIS cartridge in the year 2024 for Sonic 3 and it has a minigame with a crazy easter egg!
You’re greeted with the classic SEGA title card, and the main menu has Characters, Posters, and an Unlock option. The characters screen lets you hear a new line of dialogue for each Sonic character, the Posters screen lets you scroll through four Sonic movie posters in 16-bit quality, and the UNLOCK screen opens up a little mini game of Sonic running away from Shadow.
You can jump and run left to right, but there’s no way to win or lose during this gameplay. However, if you input the famous Sonic 3 cheat code “Up up down down Up Up Up Up,” Sonic says this: (“HEY I SAID NO CHEAT CODES... ALRIGHT JUST THIS ONCE”) and then the menu reveals a 4th option called “Trailer?”We selected the Trailer? option and the game reveals the new trailer drops on Monday, November 25!

Welcome back to Next-Gen Console Watch! This week Daemon is joined by Ryan McCaffrey from IGN's Xbox podcast, Unlocked, and Max Scoville from IGN's PlayStation show, Beyond! The topic: should Microsoft fast-track a new Xbox console since they won't be doing a mid-gen refresh? The PS5 Pro is now the most powerful game console you can buy, and since PS5's are outselling the Xbox 2:1, it might be better for Microsoft to hit the reset button. What do you think? Plus we have last week's poll results, and a new poll for you to vote on at IGN.com.

In today's Daily Fix:
Star Wars Outlaws got a huge update that brought some quality-of-life improvements, and even removed an aspect of the gameplay. Many gamers complained about Outlaws' stealth elements, so Ubisoft decided to make it a lot more forgiving. In missions where you previously could not alert the enemy, you can now go guns blazing, and you won't "fail" the mission. There's also some gunplay improvements and other things, so check out IGN.com for the full patch notes. In other news, CD Projekt Red isn't working on a PS5 Pro update for Cyberpunk 2077. In a response to a tweet, CDPR confirmed they aren't currently working on an update (though it doesn't mean one won't come at some point), and it's likely the developer is focusing on new games, like the next Cyberpunk or Witcher titles. And finally, don't expect a Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth 'Intergrade' update like FF7 Remake got. The game's director confirmed the company would rather focus on Part 3 rather than DLC for the exi
