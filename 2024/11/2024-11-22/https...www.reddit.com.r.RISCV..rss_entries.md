<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I put these down for a few months getting discouraged I couldn&#39;t seem to get non-stock OS running. The stock Debian-based image hasn&#39;t been updated in a year. I dug around the forums and docs first, but there hasn&#39;t been any updates I can see.</p> <p>I broke out the hardware again and didn&#39;t get very far. I was curious if anyone has had any luck? I&#39;ve tried both SOQUARTZ blades and the official Pi CM4 board. The firmware process is fairly messy and under-documented still for knowing what to flash to get the bootloader pointed to the right device.</p> <p>I really liked the idea of tiny blade server for separation of services and it made for a good test for trying out RISCV for practical solutions while I do things like tinker with RV assembly on small microcontrollers and things.</p> <p>The frustration is why I haven&#39;t touched any MilkV products since just out of fear I&#39;ll end up with another somewhat expensive brick.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all, I&#39;m starting my PhD where my goal is to do HW/SW co-design of an open-source RISC-V microcontroller with posit neural network hardware acceleration. I have in mind two main possible approaches:</p> <ol> <li>Expose a set of custom vector instructions, including vector add, vector multiply, vector dot product, vector activation functions (e.g., sigmoid, relu), etc. Main advantages would be relative simplicity from the programmer&#39;s perspective and ability to neatly accelerate common activation functions.</li> <li>Have a systolic array architecture, essentially a dedicated matrix multiply unit as co-processor. These are almost certainly more performant for matrix multiplication (which forms the bulk of computation), but also possibly too big/power-hungry for a microcontroller, and also more complex from a programmer&#39;s perspective.</li> </ol> <p>Could anyone (especially with more hardware and/or low-level software expertise than me) gi
