<p>From dropping LSD at award shows to coughing up blood on the office carpet – the rise and fall of James Brown’s oft-sexist lads magazine empire goes under the microscope</p><p>James Brown, erstwhile founding editor of a magazine that revolutionised the marketplace back when the magazine marketplace was a force to be reckoned with, looks like a shadow of his former enfant terrible self. He moves gingerly, speaks softly, is on steroids, he tells us, and feels ill. The double hearing aids he wears are visible now that the famous mop of curls is shorn. The cockiness that helped make his name is far less apparent. As a presence, he seems much more engaging than he did in his heyday. You suspect this is no comfort.</p><p>Still, he is the reason we’re watching Loaded: Lads, Mags and Mayhem, a 90-minute documentary telling the story of how he and a group of other hedonists with a gonzo gift “committed”, as Brown puts it at the start of the show, “the heinous crime of getting men to read m

<p>There’s nothing hugely original about this sitcom about a son and father reconnecting. But it’s laugh-out-loud funny thanks to the gag-dense script and a stellar performance from Rab C Nesbitt’s Gregor Fisher</p><p>I laughed out loud five times during the first three minutes of Only Child, which stars Greg McHugh as a semi-successful actor who returns to his home town to look after his ailing dad (Gregor Fisher). That’s probably the highest compliment you can pay the opening episode of a new sitcom – but it’s also the only feasible way to sell this series: there isn’t anything remotely original or different about this doggedly conventional comedy. Set in Forres, a sleepy town in the north of Scotland, the show is geriatric in pace and content; a gentle, bittersweet exploration of midlife’s handbrake turn, when children start parenting their own parents. And yet Bryce Hart’s script is meticulously dense with gags, delivered with exemplary timing by its two leads. In other words, it

He was about to turn eight when his father took him to Old Trafford in May 1994 and, while a goalless draw with Coventry might not thrill at first glance, there was the considerable bonus of seeing Sir Alex Ferguson’s side celebrate their procession to the title.

This Welsh-language dance-theatre show for children (recommended for ages five to nine) introduces the woefully cold and lonely Carw on Christmas Eve. With no companions, and the lights in the nearby village turned off, he follows a mysterious spark and trots tentatively into a dark forest. Fear not: Carw encounters mild danger but mostly abundant wonder, rendered with carefully calibrated stagecraft and warm performances. If you ever saw this, you might even say it glows.</p><p>The script and spellbinding songs are by Casi Wyn, former Welsh-language children’s poet laureate, and based on the 2020 animated short of the same name (the title translates as Dance of the Deer).

To conduct <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/tomserviceblog/2014/jul/29/mahlers-ninth-tom-service-symphony-guide">Mahler’s Ninth Symphony</a> aged 97 is nonpareil. Mahler’s Ninth can take 90 minutes to play. It reaches levels of intensity that seem on the edge of the bearable. It probes audaciously into every aspect of the orchestral palette. Yet this is the work that Herbert Blomstedt, visibly frailer than before, conducted in his latest London concert with the Philharmonia Orchestra.</p><p>Blomstedt may not seem a natural Mahlerian. His performances of the repertoire he normally favours – Beethoven, Brahms and Bruckner among them – are invariably wise, enabling and balanced. These are not words that come natura

<p><strong>Sam Wanamaker Playhouse, London<br></strong>Chelsea Walker’s sleek production wavers between comic and dramatic as it charts a kind of love triangle</p><p>How does a modern-day production tie up the loose threads to Shakespeare’s problem play, with its low-born female lead who entraps a man of higher standing into marriage? Is she a proto-feminist, a social climber or a sexual coercer? And is this a comedy with funerals, or a tragedy with laughter?</p><p>The beauty of director Chelsea Walker’s production is that it exposes the clashing human desires in the drama rather than attempting to paste over them. Humour sits beside unease and crisscrossing romantic passions are laid bare.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2024/nov/22/alls-well-that-ends-well-review-sam-wanamaker-playhouse-london">Continue reading...</a>

BBC Three’s new series is a surreal, deadpan and occasionally very rude tale of primarily LGBTQ+ friends who hang out under the same roof. It takes the model of a traditional family sitcom and refocuses it around a “chosen family” of people from different generations.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/nov/22/smoggie-queens-middlesbrough-drag-scene-sitcom-bbc-comedy">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Leaders of Indian capital must tackle transport and heavy industry rather than seek quick fixes, say campaigners</p><p>As winter sets in across north India – usually around the time of the country’s biggest festival, Diwali – the air in Delhi becomes thick and brown with visible pollutants. To breathe in is to taste toxic fumes. The visibility is often so bad that famous monuments are reduced to smoky blurs on the horizon. It is, as one writer once put it, as if a burial shroud has cloaked the city.</p><p>For a decade, Delhi has regularly held the dishonourable title of being the world’s most polluted city, with other Indian cities close behind.

<p>Her videos offer so much more than speech therapy and a brief respite from childcare: she is part of the fabric of our lives</p><p>There’s a woman in my house every day who my toddler loves almost as much as he loves me, and her name is Ms Rachel. If you don’t spend much time with preschool-aged children, Ms Rachel – some people mistakenly say Miss, but the Ms is important, I feel – is probably not a name that will ring a bell. To parents and grandparents and other caregivers, however, she has become the closest thing that we have to a cult figure. You see, Ms Rachel is an angel, a goddess who has bestowed upon us her supreme gifts for entertaining and educating children. I have seen her referred to as “the world’s babysitter”; people jokingly offer to Venmo her cash for all the “childcare” she provides in keeping toddlers occupied. And it’s true that she has a unique talent when it comes to entrancing children, but the content she makes is so much more than that.</p><p>Ms Rachel,

He was hairless, with swollen eyelids, and the runt of the litter. I fell in love. Over the next couple of years, he was the perfect companion. Whether he was watching Grey’s Anatomy with me or licking my nose, Gizmo brought light to my life. I remember staring into his eyes – they were so distinct, with amber-coloured lines around the irises.</p><p>Gizmo loved spending time with our terrier mix Benji and our chihuahua Chapo in our home in Las Vegas, but his best buddy was my mom.

<p>The novelist on the comfort of Dodie Smith, how Anne Tyler made her want to be a writer – and why she doesn’t reread books</p><p><strong>My earliest reading memory<br></strong>My parents read me most of the Dr Seuss books. My favourite was Ten Apples Up on Top, about a lion, a tiger and a dog counting apples. I can still conjure up the illustrations, including the last one where there’s an explosion of apples all over the page.</p><p><strong>My favourite book growing up<br></strong>The Little House series by Laura Ingalls Wilder. I was riveted by her descriptions of pioneer life and all the how-to information: how to build a log cabin, plough a field, make a ball out of a pig’s bladder. I suspect those books affected my approach to my own writing of historical fiction. Also I related to Laura’s bad-tempered rebelliousness compared with her perfect sister Mary.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/nov/22/tracy-chevalier-woolfs-the-waves-will-be-like-medicine-i-wont-l

<p>The chill of the supernatural pervades these unsettling tales, following a settlement’s history from the deep past to the near future</p><p>The quintessential “bad place” is&nbsp;one of the staples of horror fiction. For Stephen King, the bad place – think the peculiar little town of Castle Rock or the Overlook Hotel in The Shining – most usually acts as a repository for a long-forgotten evil or injustice to resurface (often literally, like the dead cat from the desecrated Native American burial ground in Pet Sematary). For writers such as Robert Aickman, the nature of the bad place is more elusive, so deeply immured in time that its effects are felt more often than seen: a&nbsp;prickling at the back of the neck, a chilly intimation of&nbsp;doom that, when spoken aloud, is ignored or ridiculed by those who have so far managed to escape its spell.</p><p>So it is with Barrowbeck, a fictional village on the Lancashire-Yorkshire border that forms the centrepiece of&nbsp;Andrew Michael
