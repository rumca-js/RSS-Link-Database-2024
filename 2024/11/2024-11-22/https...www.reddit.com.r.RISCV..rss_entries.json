I&#39;ve tried both SOQUARTZ blades and the official Pi CM4 board.

I have in mind two main possible approaches:</p> <ol> <li>Expose a set of custom vector instructions, including vector add, vector multiply, vector dot product, vector activation functions (e.g., sigmoid, relu), etc. Main advantages would be relative simplicity from the programmer&#39;s perspective and ability to neatly accelerate common activation functions.</li> <li>Have a systolic array architecture, essentially a dedicated matrix multiply unit as co-processor. These are almost certainly more performant for matrix multiplication (which forms the bulk of computation), but also possibly too big/power-hungry for a microcontroller, and also more complex from a programmer&#39;s perspective.</li> </ol> <p>Could anyone (especially with more hardware and/or low-level software expertise than me) gi", "id": 1567634, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1gxd3ly/design_for_a_riscv_mcu_with_ml_accelerator", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 471, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Design for a RISC-V MCU with ML accelerator", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "author": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-11-22T08:23:07+00:00", "description": "&#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/fullgrid\"> /u/fullgrid </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://pine64.org/2024/10/18/november_2024/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1gx35x3/pine64_november_update_pinecam_pinetabv_ox64/\">[comments]</a></span>", "id": 1564326, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1gx35x3/pine64_november_update_pinecam_pinetabv_ox64", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 471, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Pine64 November Update: PineCam, PineTab-V, Ox64[, Avaota A1]", "vote": 0}]
