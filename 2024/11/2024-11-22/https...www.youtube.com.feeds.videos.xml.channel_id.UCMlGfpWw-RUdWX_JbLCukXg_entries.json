This Back to Basics talk will explain the foundations of C++ templates, covering the language rules that must be understood in order to work with template code effectively.  I will provide some guidelines for how to use templates and how to write templates.\n\nWhile you won't come away from this being an expert in template metaprogramming--that's an impossible task for any hour-long presentation--you should have a strong enough foundation that you can correctly maintain template code while you develop your expertise in generic programming over time.\n\nThis talk is designed for those who are learning C++ and want an introduction to templates and generic programming.  It will also be useful for experienced C++ developers who haven't mastered templates yet and wan", "id": 1567176, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_0HsEBsgPc", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 420, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCMlGfpWw-RUdWX_JbLCukXg", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/0_0HsEBsgPc/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Back to Basics: Generic Programming in C++ - David Olsen - CppCon 2024", "vote": 0}]
