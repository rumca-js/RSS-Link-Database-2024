Gabe Eltaeb of Big Man Comics is at The Babylon Bee to talk about how we are in a vibe shift, the Republicans are the cool kids now, woke is dead, and cancel culture is canceled. The Southern Poverty Law Center tried to attack The Babylon Bee and its sister site, Not The Bee, as a “junk news site” as part of its Hatewatch coverage, but just about everyone just laughed at them. Oh, and Bluesky is a silly place.
