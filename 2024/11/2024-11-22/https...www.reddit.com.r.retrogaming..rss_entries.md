When I started using the thing, I saw some glitches, but the games were otherwise functional. While I saw this wasn&#39;t the best way to play retro games I lost my receipt for the purchase and even if I had it the store that sold the thing was well over an hour away so I didn&#39;t consider worth the effort to return.</p> <p>Unfortunately when playing Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy VI, I eventually ran into gamebreaking bugs where I couldn&#39;t advance through what was supposed to be a ladder and a door, respectively, forcing me to play the games on other platforms.</p> <p>I am a glass half full type person so I still enjoy the experience I had and the whole thing got me interested in buying retro games on Steam and my Switch.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Sensitive-H

The plot centers around Guybrush Threepwood trying to stop a mysterious villain named Ozzie Mandrake, but many felt it lacked the same sense of adventure, mystery, and cleverness found in the previous titles. The inclusion of the new antagonist, Ozzie, and the introduction of the &quot;Monkey Kombat&quot; minigame were also seen as less compelling than the memorable villains and storylines of earlier installments, like LeChuck. <a href="https://youtu.be/9TkkabvfLp0">https://youtu.be/9TkkabvfLp0</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Westraat1"> /u/Westraat1 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1gxgnk4/escape_from_monkey_island_story/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1gxgnk4/escape_from_monkey_island_story/">[comments

Not everyone reads my weekly thread so I&#39;m sorry if I&#39;m going to say this again. I actually like several Double Dragon games a lot. I like DD II and III on the NES, I played the heck out of the Game Boy port of Double Dragon 1, and I even played and beat Double Dragon II on Game Boy. I even remember playing and liking Super Double Dragon a lot. </p> <p>I&#39;ve been skipping Double Dragon (NES) because the enemy stun frames are shorter so they are quick to counter attack. I also don&#39;t like how you need to earn points to unlock moves. But I&#39;m giving it another go, maybe I&#39;ll like it more this time.</p> <p>What about you folks?
