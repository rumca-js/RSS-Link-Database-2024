<p class="has-drop-cap is-lead">Throughout 2023, in honor of the magnificent <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/zelda">Polygon celebrated Nintendo’s Legend of Zelda</a> series. It was fascinating. Perhaps no other video game series is so rewarding to revisit, or presents such wildly different, refracted visions of its core idea — which nevertheless remains consistent throughout.</p>
