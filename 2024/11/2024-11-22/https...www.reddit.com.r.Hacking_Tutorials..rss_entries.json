The adapter didn&#39;t work the first time I tried and turns out I had to install custom drivers for linux mint. It was working fine but when I switched my main pc to Windows (Because of university reasons) it didn&#39;t work anymore, or I was doing something wrong. The adapter detects wireless networks on windows but when I connect it to the VM, it detects the adapter and I can see it on ifconfig but it just won&#39;t detect any networks both in monitor and managed mode. The adapter came with a driver disk and I installed it but it didn&#39;t seemed to work.</p> <p>I&#39;m not really an expert but I&#39;m guessing that this might be a driver issue? Maybe when I plug the adapter in, windows installed it&#39;s own drivers automaticly and when I tried to install this adapter&#39;s drivers, it conflicted.
