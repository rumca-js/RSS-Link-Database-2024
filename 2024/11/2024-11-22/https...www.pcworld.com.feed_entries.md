<p>Microsoft is positioning its contentious Recall feature for Windows 11 as a headline capability for Copilot+ laptops. So it’s kind of weird that when the previously delayed tool went live, it only did so for x64-based machines and not Arm-based Snapdragon laptops that made such a splash earlier this year. Well, if you have one of those, you can now try Recall via the Windows Insider program.</p>



<p>Microsoft <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2024/11/22/previewing-recall-with-click-to-do-on-copilot-pcs-with-windows-insiders-in-the-dev-channel/">just announced</a> that Recall, which records pretty much everything you do on Windows, is now available to Snapdragon-powered Copilot+ PCs. You’ll need to get on the Insider Program (a fancy title for a beta) and join the Dev Channel if you want to see what all the hubbub is about. Fortunately,

<p>If you’re a PC gamer, you know how expensive it can be. In addition to purchasing your favorite triple-A titles, you also need a powerful machine to run them on. When it comes to gaming laptops, it gets even more complicated, as it requires an intricate cooling system to handle the heat-generating components inside. Fortunately for you, there are some inexpensive options out there. In fact, when it comes to a <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2269248/buying-a-gaming-laptop-these-are-the-minimum-specs-you-should-accept.html">sub-$1,000 gaming laptop</a>, you don’t have to cut as many corners as you may think.</p>

<p>Begun, the OLED monitor price wars have! We’re already seeing tons of deals on gaming displays for Black Friday, and OLED upgrades have recently smashed through a $500 price floor.</p>



<p>This 27-inch AOC 1440p OLED monitor is the cheapest one we’ve seen yet, with <a href="https://www.newegg.com/aoc-ag276qzd-27-qhd-240-hz-oled-black/p/N82E16824160507">Newegg selling it for just $400</a>. That’s a whopping $200 off its regular price, making it less than half of what you’d pay for a similar monitor just a little while ago.</p>



<p>Though AOC is generally a budget brand, this Agon Pro AG276QZD isn’t skimping. It’s a 27-inch monitor with the “sweet spot” QHD (2560×1440) resolution that’s popular with PC gamers right now. And with its 240Hz refresh rate, 0.03ms response time, and Nvidia G-Sync compatibility, it’s more than fast enough for intense online m

<p>Any monitor can be used for PC gaming, but a display built for productivity will likely leave you underwhelmed. Limited contrast, blurry motion, and slow refresh rates still hold basic productivity monitors back in games. Fortunately, there’s no shortage of excellent gaming monitors available at a wide range of price points—and the best of them embrace cutting-edge technology unavailable in any other PC display. </p>



<p>The following are the best gaming monitors we’ve tested throughout this year and last. If you want to learn more about what we look for in a good gaming monitor and how we test them, scroll further down the page.</p>

<p>Specifically, the crackdown focuses on how developers communicate upcoming content for their games and what they’re allowed to promise. Failure to honor and deliver their advertised promises could have serious consequences for the games in question.</p>

<p>There’s no better way to read nowadays than with a Kindle. Sure, having a physical book in your hands has its special appeal, but lugging multiple books around when you’re out and about — say, on a commute — isn’t the easiest or most convenient thing to do.</p>



<p>Thankfully, this early Black Friday deal has slashed the prices on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Kindle/dp/B0CNV9F72P/">Amazon’s newest Kindle down to $85</a> (23 percent off) and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Amazon-Kindle-Paperwhite-glare-free/dp/B0CFPJYX7P/">newest Kindle Paperwhite down to $130</a> (19 percent off).

<p>I’m late to the RPG <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>. I held out for over a year before purchasing it despite the fact that the game surpasses any released in the franchise so far with its excellent graphics, unprecedented freedom to explore, and ability to interact with the environment.</p>



<p>What finally got me in then? Admittedly, it’s the one thing I absolutely can’t resist in a top-rated RPG — the fact that it now has mods! That change in a game as detailed and intuitive as <em>BG3</em> is sheer gold for me, making every cent paid for it an irresistible value proposition. It has also got me thinking: Why can’t all RPGs have mods?</p>
