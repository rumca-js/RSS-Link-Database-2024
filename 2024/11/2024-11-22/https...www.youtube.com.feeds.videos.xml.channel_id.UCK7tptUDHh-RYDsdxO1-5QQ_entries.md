President-elect Donald Trump has a long list of policy objectives that he wants to implement quickly including border policy for immigration, closing the Department of Education, implementing tariffs and more. For most of Trump’s objectives for his second term, there are limitations including checks and balances within the process or limitations directly from Congress.
