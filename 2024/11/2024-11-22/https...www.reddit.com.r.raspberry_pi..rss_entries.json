My main systems for output are the GPIO pins (of course), but I&#39;m also trying to get a LCD screen to display text through the I2C (BSC) peripheral. I&#39;ve been able to get the GPIO to function just as expected, but the main problem has been getting the LCD to display any text. My main ask is, do you see any errors with my code or setup that may be preventing the LCD from displaying the text? I&#39;ve gone through the datasheets that I could find, and even asked Chat GPT for help if the code looked correct, but I honestly cannot find anywhere I may have messed up. The main issue that may possibly be happening is that I don&#39;t have the right address for the LCD screen - I&#39;ve put it as 0x27 (in function I2CInitialize writing to the I2C_A (address) register), but I&#39;ve seen ", "id": 1568860, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1gxi0yl/trouble_with_custom_os_i2c_lcd_screen_loading", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 470, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Trouble with custom OS I2C LCD screen loading", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "author": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-11-22T19:01:26+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hello!
