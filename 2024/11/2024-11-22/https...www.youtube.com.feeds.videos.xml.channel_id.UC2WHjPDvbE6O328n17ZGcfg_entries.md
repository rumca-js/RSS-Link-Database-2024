I think everybody should build their own auth… if they want to learn about authentication. It’s a great thing to rebuild these common pieces of software to understand how they work and make yourself a better developer, like a text editor, or an HTTP server, or a task manager, or an authentication system. You learn the mechanics, and the pitfalls of certain implementations. It helps you understand what’s under the hood and how these things actually work. But when it comes to authentication for your application… the security of your users and their data… maybe you don’t roll your own.
In this video I don't tell you what to do, but instead, show you what goes into rolling your own authentication, some alternatives to it, and some horror stories of giant companies' authentication failing and costing them millions or billions of dollars.
