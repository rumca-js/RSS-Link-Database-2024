The EU has some of the strictest laws after US on streaming, it&#39;s doesnt make much sense to me to set up shop there.</p> <p>What prevents them from setting up a server in Russia, India etc? It seems to me that the &quot;plaintiffs&quot; in this case are mainly going to be film and TV companies based in the EU or US. If a debrid service was to base itself in a country like Russia or China surely they would be much more protected against these types of orders?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So after reading about it a while ago I got my first forced ad break on insta. For those who haven&#39;t been cursed Ith this abomination yet it&#39;s an unskippable ad that you can&#39;t scroll past. Is there an better alternative to insta other than aero? So far there&#39;s seem to be only two and from what I&#39;ve gathered they&#39;re not that safe? Can you revanced insta? Is that a thing?

If anybody can help it would be greatly appreciated!</p> <p>(I should mention that yes, this is a pirated version of the first uploaded crack. That&#39;s why I&#39;m posting here.
