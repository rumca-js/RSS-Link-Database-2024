The popular \"moon theory\" was recently debunked, however, as no new GTA 6 trailer has dropped. The theory suggests that Rockstar Games has been leaving hints as to when new trailers will drop via lunar clues in screenshots. One image released last year featured the moon in a particular lunar phase, and (likely coincidentally) the GTA 6 trailer dropped the day the real life moon was in the same phase. Didn't work this time, however. In other news, Black Ops 6 was a huge seller...on PlayStation. PS5 sales made up a whopping 82% of the game's sales, but it did move the needle on Game Pass subscriptions on Xbox and PC.
