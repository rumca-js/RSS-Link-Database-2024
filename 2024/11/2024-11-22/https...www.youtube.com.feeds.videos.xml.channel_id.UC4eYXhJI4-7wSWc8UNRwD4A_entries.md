Watching Wyatt Flores lead his band through their turn behind the Desk is like watching stardust coalesce into not just a celestial star, but an actual Americana and country star. 

With genuine smiles and even a nervous false start, Flores is engaging in both his personality and music. This performance is a reflection of his shift into a more joyous celebration of his small town Oklahoma roots following his well crafted songs meditating on loss.

I don’t know about you, but I find it very difficult — if not impossible — to not be captivated by his anthemic singalongs that feature a voice dripping with a twang that was made for storytelling.
