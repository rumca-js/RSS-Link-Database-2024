<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I need to pick the hive mind here. I&#39;m looking for like little people fantasy. Like pixies, the borrowers, the Landfill wars, and The household rpg. Using keys and needles for weapons, stories like that. I&#39;m having a hard time finding such stories. Urban fantasy is preferred, but just fantasy would be okay too. When I say little, I mean like riding rats, or squirrels.. like tiny people or fairies or fae. I know it&#39;s kinda specific, but I&#39;m hopeful there&#39;s more than just a couple young reader books. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Dizzy_Star934"> /u/Dizzy_Star934 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1gxm1zz/hello_all_im_looking_for_pixie_recs/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1gxm1zz/hello_all_im_looking_for_pixie_recs/">[comments]</a></span>

(Martin and Jordan jaded me re unfinished stuff, though I obviously still make exceptions.) I&#39;ve seen a number of posts saying that Wurtz&#39;s series is excellent and under-read, so I thought I&#39;d ask you experts what the odds are of my liking it given my past literature experiences. I realize her writing leans toward formal but I&#39;ve appreciated such before (e.g., Donaldson&#39;s Covenant books). Or is there a better candidate?</p> <p>Song of Fire and Ice = B I really enjoyed the books but points off for effectively leaving the tale unfinished.

## The finale never the favorite book of a series

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve known for a while that the second books in trilogies tend to be my favorites: they get to build off the framework established in the first book, without the pressure of wrapping everything up like the final book has. </p> <p>However, I just realized I haven&#39;t read <em>any</em> trilogy or series where the finale was my favorite book. To be clear, I mean this for a finished, continuous series that follows one (set of) character(s) for a full story arc. I&#39;ve read series that have good, fulfilling finales for sure. But if I were to chose one favorite book -- the one I enjoyed the most, or that I&#39;d most likely reread -- absolute none would be a finale. And that&#39;s from the 750+ series I have on my read shelf. The realization has kind of thrown me in a tailspin wondering what I am even doing reading and finishing series. </p> <p>Have you had a similar experience? Or the total opposite?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>By Lauretta Hignett. Holy crap, this book is awesome! The title made it sound so mundane, like every other romance-obsessed kinda urban fantasy…but that is wrong, like all wrong. I’m ranking this right up there with Harry Dresden and Ilona Andrews’s best books. It’s got action, creative monsters, and awesome heroine who is both naive and beautifully insane. And it’s funny, too. Definitely one of the most fun, interesting, action packed, funny urban fantasies I have encountered since my last Jim Butcher novel. Most urban fantasy these days is just lacking something, but this one has <em>got</em> it! Seriously, give it a shot—in spite of the title. I suspect you’ll be as pleasantly surprised as myself.</p> <p>A young woman with a <em>hell</em> of a backstory who still manages to be naive in her own, eyes wide-open but endearing way, leaves a small magical town for Philadelphia to work with Other-CPS to help vulnerable children who aren’t necessarily hu

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>It seems like 2 out of 3 fantasy books these days are primarily about romance and take more genre cues from the romance genre than classic fantasy.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This was a decent fantasy-mystery that I&#39;d recommend to anyone who really enjoys the biopunk/New Weird style of worldbuilding, but overall the story felt a little flat to me.</p> <p>The setting is a China Mieville-type biopunk fantasy world, with an empire that&#39;s constantly under attack from giant monsters a la Attack on Titan. It&#39;s very obviously AoT--they even have the three concentric rings of walls. But the situation with the titans is not the main plot, it&#39;s just a backdrop for a murder mystery story.</p> <p>The protagonists are a classic Holmes &amp; Watson type pair--the narrator Din, who has been genetically modified to have perfect recall; and his mistress Ana, a genius investigator who I can only describe as flamboyantly autistic.
