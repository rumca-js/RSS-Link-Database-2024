I grew up playing AoM casually, got into ranked Halo Wars 2, and now I LOVE AoM on my controller.</p> <p>Does anybody else feel that way? Probably not, but that&#39;s kind of my point. AoM isn&#39;t on the list of GOTY obviously, but I already know it&#39;s the best game I&#39;ve played all year. What are the review scores of AoM?

## Looking for a game that will satiate my nostalgia

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I recently had a bunch of nostalgia for Club Penguin. I tried revisiting the revivals of it but it didn&#39;t quite scratch the same itch. My favourite parts were for sure the amount of people on at once, and the events they would throw. I remember every few months it felt like every zone in that game changed drastically and it was a lot of fun seeing how everything was different and unique. It&#39;s something I miss and haven&#39;t really found since. Does anyone know of any games that have that large community where big cool events happen like that? I don&#39;t really play many online games so I wouldn&#39;t know. Obviously Club Penguin had that Disney money so it&#39;s not like those can be very common but I figure maybe there might be something similar?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/heydavesalad"> /u/heydavesalad </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1gx34ke/loo

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Let’s come up with some cool ideas to add some spice into the games we love playing. I will go first.</p> <p>In the game, The Long Dark, you have to survive in a harsh winter where the Northern lights happen and disrupts technology so bad that it’s unusable. You have to scavenge and try to stay alive as you get the best possible equipment to increase your chances of survival.</p> <p>My challenge is this:</p> <p>In Custom difficulty mode, set the item frequency to generous amounts. Meaning you will almost always come across some food, and weaponry. However, here’s where things kick up a notch.</p> <p>The wildlife is always aggressive. You will have to make sure they don’t cut your run short, all the time. Survive up to a week, and you’ll have completed it.</p> <p>What are yours?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Brungala"> /u/Brungala </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comment
