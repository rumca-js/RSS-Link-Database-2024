<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone,</p> <p>Iâ€™m working on a project that uses Django&#39;s <code>formtools.wizard</code> to guide users through a multi-step form. I need help with integrating a Google Map into one of the wizard steps so that users can select a location. Ideally, the map would allow users to drop a pin, and the longitude and latitude would be captured and passed as part of the form submission.</p> <p>The solution Iâ€™m considering is:</p> <ol> <li>Customizing the HTML for the wizard step.</li> <li>Embedding a Google Map in that step.</li> <li>Using JavaScript to handle user interactions with the map (e.g., capturing latitude and longitude when a pin is dropped).</li> <li>Storing the latitude and longitude in hidden input fields within the form.</li> </ol> <p>This approach seems to work in theory, but Iâ€™m wondering if itâ€™s the &quot;proper&quot; way to do this. Is there a more smart solution for handling this kind of integration, especially in the context of t

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi, i&#39;m pretty new to django and I am curently working on a project as my internship. The idea is that i have a bunch of executables in my backend. Those executables can read a file when launched and then they write a bunch of results inside a folder of choice. The app I have to make is basically a website where people can sign up, run an executable of their choice, save the various results and view them/ compare them as graphs in the frontend. </p> <p>My idea was to dymanically create a folder in the backend for each user and when they launch the executable it will ask it to write the results in this specific folder. </p> <p>Is that a good idea ? what are the best practices to handle such a problem ? And how should i structure my application to have the cleanest thing possible ? </p> <p>As i said i&#39;m pretty new to django and I really want to do a good job on this project so any help is more than apreciated !!</p> <p>(the flow of the project

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Yesterday I ran into a problem that I&#39;ve never had with Django before where it was setting a default null field to not null when applying migrations to a database table. Has anyone else seen this happen? I&#39;m trying to figure out if it&#39;s a fluke or if there&#39;s something I need to fix.</p> <p>For more context, I have a Django app using a mariadb database. One model has a foreign key field that&#39;s set with null=True. This has been working fine, but yesterday when testing a fresh deployment, scripts started failing with a message that this field could not be null. I checked the create table in the database itself and saw that the column was set incorrectly. I checked the migrations. They had the correct null=True, and they had all run without errors. The only recent change to the migrations was that when I generated new ones for an update to another model, Django added changes that switched this field&#39;s corresponding primary key fie

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Today&#39;s Feature Friday reaches back into Django&#39;s history for a small-but-powerful tool: <code>assertNumQueries</code>!</p> <p>This method from <code>TransactionTestCase</code> helps you write tests that verify the number of queries made by a piece of code.</p> <p>It is a great way to check DB performance and catch regressions or &quot;n+1&quot; issues (when you accidentally make a single DB query for every object in a loop instead of loading everything up front from the database).</p> <p>You can pass a function to <code>assertNumQueries</code>, or use it as a context manager, as shown in the example below:</p> <pre><code>from django.test import TransactionTestCase from .services import my_function_that_hits_the_db class MyTest(TransactionTestCase): def test_db_performance(self): # called directly self.assertNumQueries(7, my_function_that_hits_the_db) # used as a context manager with self.assertNumQueries(2): Person.objects.create(name=&quot;
