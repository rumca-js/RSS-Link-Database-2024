<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I saw a post about MK1 and thought I&#39;d check the game out, now that it has been a while it&#39;s probably pretty cheap. To my surprise, that game is 140 gigs on steam! As someone who would play around with single player and not really touch multiplayer, seeing that game size kinda puts me off. I don&#39;t have a cap on my Internet, and I recently bought an extra 2 TB SSD, but still I feel like the game doesn&#39;t justify that size. I&#39;ve also avoided newer CoD&#39;s for similar reasons. I just don&#39;t want to download a 100 gigs for a 6 hour campaign. Is anyone else like this? Maybe I&#39;m still stuck in the mindset of having to juggle smaller hard drive space</p> <p>EDIT: just to clarify, it wouldn&#39;t stop me from getting a game I&#39;m really interested in, like Baldurs Gate 3 or Black Myth Wukong, but it has been a red flag for a game I would otherwise pick up on a whim if I caught it on sale.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted

I know it&#39;s not considered an all-timer but with the setting, exploration, and minute-to-minute gameplay I always find myself coming back to it every few years. I don&#39;t even play the main campaign, I just turn off the mini-map and wander around, enjoying the atmosphere and experience. A game I always wanted to get into but just couldn&#39;t enjoy is UnReal World. The conceptual design, world-building, and player agency is what sold me, (not to mention Mandalore Gaming&#39;s review) but the sum of its parts never kept me coming back for more. UnReal is a game that I&#39;ll reinstall every so often, thinking this is the time it&#39;ll stick, but I can never overcome the first few hours whatever scenario I pick.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Has there ever before been a game where the control mechanic of the game is interwoven into the plot and doubles as the point of the story?</p> <p>It&#39;s incredible to me that the story of the game centers around a man taking the dead body of a woman to a forbidden land and doing the dirty work of a God to hopefully resurrect her. He will not accept that she&#39;s dead and fights to bring her back to life. Whereas you, as a player, goes about defeating the colossi in the forbidden land by scaling them, hanging on for dear life, and hoping not to get flung to the ground and stomped.</p> <p>What I&#39;m saying here is: Both the point of the story and the mechanic of the game itself revolve around the idea: &quot;Hold on, don&#39;t let go.&quot;</p> <p>The main character&#39;s position in the story is also the literal control tactic you used to beat the game.<br/> &quot;Hold on, don&#39;t let go.&quot;</p> <p>That blows my mind.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -
