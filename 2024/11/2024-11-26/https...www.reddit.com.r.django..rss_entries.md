To make this process faster and less error-prone, I‚Äôve started working on a tool that automates some of the repetitive tasks.</p> <h1>What the tool would do (initial idea):</h1> <ul> <li>Generate Django model code from a simple configuration (via a CLI).</li> <li>Automatically create corresponding serializers.</li> <li>Generate CRUD API views (e.g., <code>APIView</code> or <code>ViewSet</code>).</li> <li>Set up the necessary URL configurations.</li> </ul> <h1>How it would work:</h1> <ul> <li>The tool would be a Python package with a CLI.</li> <li>For example, you could run this command: </li> <li> <code>django-skeleton create-model User name:str email:str age:int</code><br/></li> <li>To generate: <ul> <li>A model file for <code>User</code>.</li> <li>A serializer file.</li> <li>A CRUD view (e.g

This was just the boilerplate Django success page with no users or database configuration. I feel that with around 50-100 members sending announcements on the daily, this is going to rack up the bill quickly.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Not too long ago, I fell in love with Django. It made creating websites feel like working on a fun Lego project without having to buy the actual Lego set, and without having to clean up after. I started making YT coding tutorials to give myself more excuses to code, and because explaining what I do out loud helped me learn better, and sharing what I love with others feels great, like I am part of a community.</p> <p>At some point, someone I know noticed I loved to code and asked me to build them a blog site. I said <em>&quot;I am on it, totally!&quot;</em> But also, I was quietly panicking because I‚Äôd never made a blog before and hadn‚Äôt coded anything that involved a Content Management System in my life. Then I remembered seeing Wagtail CMS mentioned here on the Django Subreddit a few times. I figured, <em>Why not give this a shot?</em> So I jumped into Wagtail‚Äôs getting-started tutorial without overthinking it.</p> <p>And you know what? Wagtail turn

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello, the reason I have this doubt is because yesterday a classmate asked for help in a project that is using Django, this problem was related to handling the error &quot;user already exists&quot; in the view of registering a user, when I saw the code I saw that most of the logic and error handling stuff was in the &#39;forms.py&#39;, one view receives the form, other renders the template, </p> <p>my first thought was &quot;Isn&#39;t that over-complicated?&quot; I normally handle forms in a single view and template, the view with GET and POST and the template with a form, if there is an error I can simply handle it there and if necessary re-render the template with {&quot;error&quot;: &quot;user already exists&quot;} and then {% if error %}.... </p> <p>But that&#39;s just my opinion as a student, is there some advantage in using the &#39;forms.py&#39; feature of Django?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.co
