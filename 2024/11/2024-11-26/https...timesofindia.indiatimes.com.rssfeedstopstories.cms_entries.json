The oversight, misdiagnosed as a lump at other hospitals, was finally discovered and rectified during a five-hour surgery at AIIMS, Jodhpur.

Early rainfall cessation, increased machinery availability, and stricter monitoring contributed to this decline.  While Punjab also saw a reduction, experts caution that satellite data limitations may not fully capture the extent of stubble burning practices.",
