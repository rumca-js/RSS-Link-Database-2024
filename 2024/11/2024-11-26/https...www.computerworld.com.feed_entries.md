<p>Nvidia on Monday showed off a new generative AI (genAI) model that can be used to create all kinds of sounds and music: <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/fugatto-gen-ai-sound-model/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fugatto</a> (which stands for Foundational Generative Audio Transformer Opus 1).</p>



<p>By entering a text prompt, a user can make Fugatto create basically any sound, such as a trumpet barking like a dog. The genAI ​​model can also be used to change the dialect of a singer or turn a piano piece into a song, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/nvidia-shows-ai-model-that-can-modify-voices-generate-novel-sounds-2024-11-25/" target="_blan

<p>Brazil’s antitrust body has joined a chorus of regulators to demand that <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/brazil-antitrust-body-rules-apple-must-lift-restrictions-in-app-payments-2024-11-26/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.reuters.com/technology/brazil-antitrust-body-rules-apple-must-lift-restrictions-in-app-payments-2024-11-26/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple permit external payment methods in iOS apps</a>. It’s just the latest page in an ongoing story, but might be enough to break this camel’s backbone. </p>



<p>What this means, at the risk of stating the obvious, is that Apple now faces so much pressure to open up to external payment systems, it could fin

<p>I recently wrote about <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3603617/what-the-trump-election-means-for-microsofts-ai-dreams.html">how President-elect Donald J. Trump’s actions on AI might affect Microsoft</a>. This week, I’m focused on what his antitrust regulation and environmental plans — and the biggest wildcard of all, his personal vendettas — could do to the company. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What Microsoft can expect from antitrust lawsuits</strong></h2>



<p>Trump believes that the less regulation on big business, the better. So you would expect him to put an end to antitrust suits against the tech industry. But that’s not necessarily the case.</p>

<p>For decades, enterprises have allowed their workers to use whatever free browser they wanted to access the most sensitive files possible. CIOs believed that security software in the environment — such as endpoint security apps or supposedly secure web gateways — would deliver any needed protections.</p>



<p>And until 2020, that view was somewhat valid. But when various pandemic-fueled changes hit the workplace, almost everything changed. But as extreme browser exposure became far more dangerous, the shift was so gradual that almost no one in IT noticed any danger. Those changes included massive numbers of new remote sites; skyrocketing shifts away from on-premises tools and apps to the cloud;
