Code & Circuit, a non-profit organization based in Amesbury, MA, is a place where kids can use technology to create, collaborate, and learn! Spot is a central part of their program, where educators use the robot to get younger participants excited about STEM fields, coding, and robotics, while advanced learners have the opportunity to build applications using an industrial robot.
