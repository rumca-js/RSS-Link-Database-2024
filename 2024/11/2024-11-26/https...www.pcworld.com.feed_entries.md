<p>If the Black Friday sales have you searching through webpages for smartphone accessories you’ve come to the right place. Here we point out the top accessories you will want after you bag a new phone. On the list are no-brainer essentials to keep your phone safe, like a screen protector and a phone case, but you’ll also find other items to make using your smartphone as easy as pie, like a phone stand and Bluetooth earbuds. </p>



<p>A lot of phones don’t come with cable chargers nowadays so you might want to pick up a wireless charger (which is a more convenient way to charge your phone) while the Black Friday sales are on. If you’ve already got one, a good power bank and car charger are recommended to keep your phone juiced up when you’re on the road. But enough talk… it’s time to jump in and browse the list!</p>

<p>It’s Black Friday and that means you can get just about every tech product you need, including a new tablet, for a whole lot less money than you otherwise would. But beyond just securing a new tablet, you’re going to want accessories — items to keep it safe and make it a breeze to use.</p>



<p>On top of your shopping list should be a stand to prop your tablet up so you can watch videos or play games hands-free. A case or folio cover and a screen protector will ensure that your tablet won’t easily be scratched or broken. A charging cable or portable charger will allow you to keep your tablet powered up for whenever you need it. There are others useful things you’ll need too — so be sure to browse our list of must-have accessories below.</p>

<p>“I hacked your company,” says a message on the CEO’s monitor. “You should hire me to protect you.” It seems like something out of a 90s Hollywood movie (or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bS5P_LAqiVg">a self-aware 2010s YouTube short</a>). But a Missouri man allegedly tried to make it a reality by “hacking” multiple businesses and selling his security services to them. He got arrested instead.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-wdmo/pr/kc-man-indicted-computer-hacking">the US Attorney’s Office</a> in Kansas City, Missouri, Nicholas Michael Kloster has been formally charged with accessing a protected computer and related offenses. The press release (spotted by <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/doj-man-hacked-networks-to-pitch-cybersecurity-services/">BleepingComputer</a>) compiles investigation from

<p>With some desktop PCs marked down by as much as $1,000, the Black Friday sales can be the perfect time to save on a new rig.

<p>What will you need? For starters you’ll want a monitor, keyboard, and mouse. To expand your PC’s port options, you’ll also want a USB hub.</p>



<p>A surge protector will help protect your PC hardware from electrical surges. To transfer files to and from your device, an external hard drive or an external SSD is what you’re looking for.
