<p>An actor of the Oscar-winner’s calibre has deserved better for a long time – and is now front and centre of this legal drama. It’s far more than a spinoff of the 1980s US series … it’s a mystery fuelled by corporate greed</p><p>Matlock is an almost complete reimagining of the 1980s US legal series, though it does pay tribute to its origins in multiple ways. Those expecting another straightforward drama about lawyers will find that those expectations are largely met during the first episode. But be forewarned: eventually it begins to defy expectations.</p><p>To say more would be to build anticipation unnecessarily – spoiler alert, Kathy Bates does not turn&nbsp;out to be an alien – but as you amble through familiar territory, you are actually wandering towards&nbsp;a&nbsp;more substantial, more intriguing proposition.

<p>Beneath headline figures of the chief executive’s bumper raise, what does the RFU stand for and want to achieve?</p><p>There have been suggestions in recent years, little more than rumours though plenty of them, that the Rugby Football Union’s chief executive, Bill Sweeney, might have been preparing his exit strategy. That finding a replacement for Eddie Jones could be his parting gift, that negotiating the new eight-year agreement with the Premiership could be his intended legacy.

<p>Thirty years ago, more than 500 activists united to save a street – and their actions marked a major turning-point in the environmental movement</p><p>Walking through Leyton, in east London, you could easily miss Claremont Road. It is hardly a road at all, but a stubby little side street between terrace houses that ends abruptly in a brick wall. But when it comes to the history of direct action, this could be one of the most significant sites in England. Thirty years ago, in November 1994, the scene here was very different: 700 police officers and bailiffs in riot gear marched into a significantly larger Claremont Road and waged battle against about 500 activists, who were dug in – some of them literally – against efforts to evict them.</p><p>The activists occupied rooftop towers, treehouses, underground bunkers and even secret tunnels. It took three days to get them all out. In retrospect, the “Battle of Claremont Road”, as it came to be known, was an almost unbelievable event. “

<p>Images by Fred W McDarrah feature in a new exhibition that follows key moments of community and liberation</p><p>The Manhattan photographer Fred McDarrah came to prominence documenting the Beat movement that overtook Greenwich Village in the 1950s, capturing, among others, Jack Kerouac (who sat for a portrait in McDarrah’s apartment) and one of the earliest photos of a very young and unknown Bob Dylan. It was this portfolio that made his name at the Village Voice, where he would work for an astonishing 50 years, but toward the end of the 1960s McDarrah began to photograph an entirely new movement sweeping over the Village.</p><p>In spring 1966 at Julius’s Bar, a short walk from the Stonewall Inn, four gay men – Dick Leitsch, Craig Rodwell, John Timmons and Randy Wicker – engaged in what they termed a “sip-in” in order to challenge a law that made it a prosecutable offense for one man to buy another a drink.
