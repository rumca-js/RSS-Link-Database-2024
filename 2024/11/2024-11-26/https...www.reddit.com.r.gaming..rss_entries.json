To my surprise, that game is 140 gigs on steam! As someone who would play around with single player and not really touch multiplayer, seeing that game size kinda puts me off. I don&#39;t have a cap on my Internet, and I recently bought an extra 2 TB SSD, but still I feel like the game doesn&#39;t justify that size. I&#39;ve also avoided newer CoD&#39;s for similar reasons. I just don&#39;t want to download a 100 gigs for a 6 hour campaign. Is anyone else like this? Maybe I&#39;m still stuck in the mindset of having to juggle smaller hard drive space</p> <p>EDIT: just to clarify, it wouldn&#39;t stop me from getting a game I&#39;m really interested in, like Baldurs Gate 3 or Black Myth Wukong, but it has been a red flag for a game I would otherwise pick up on a whim if I caught it on sale.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted",
