I recently decided to begin exposing my services externally so I could have remote access to plex among other things. I use one docker host for all my containers and its all hosted on my primary LAN.

I have a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-zero/">raspi pi 0</a> at home and I self host few services on it.<br/> Because omnivore is shutting down (😭😭😭), I recently tried to deploy a wallabag instance on it, but I experience performance issues.</p> <p>First, I built and deployed a docker container based on <a href="https://github.com/wallabag/docker/blob/master/Dockerfile">this dockerfile</a>. I cannot use official docker images since raspi 0 runs on armv6. Then, I tried to install it directly on the host, without docker to see if it would improve the performance.</p> <p>But in both cases, each time I&#39;m loading the webapp or the api, the <code>php-fpm</code> process takes more than 90% of CPU usage and often crashes. Is there any chance to optimize this service? Or should I just consider upgrading to a better raspi?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/aTx__r"> /u/aTx

Currently I have two VPS in contabo but I get load issues (most of times cpu usage goes over 90% and sometimes 30-40% even though the traffic is same ) . So i thought to move all websites into 1 dedicated server . I tried to buy a server from hetzner auction but I am having issues adding cc when registering . Support says it&#39;s related to my bank . </p> <p>I think I will try netcup but before can anyone share reviews about netcup , contabo dedicated servers and suggest if there are good alternatives?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Extreme-Attention711"> /u/Extreme-Attention711 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1h0bw0i/looking_for_a_dedicated_server/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1h0bw0i/looking_for_a_dedicated_server/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone,</p> <p>I previously posted a question about VPS configurations, but I realized I didn’t phrase it the way I intended. My actual question is:</p> <p>For hosting multiple services using Docker (and possibly Coolify for management), which setup is <strong>more commonly used and practical</strong>:</p> <ol> <li><strong>One high-spec VPS</strong>: Centralized setup where all services run on a single VPS (e.g., 2 vCPU + 8GB RAM).</li> <li><strong>Multiple low-spec VPSs</strong>: Distributed setup with smaller VPSs (e.g., 2 vCPU + 4GB RAM each) where services are separated for isolation.</li> </ol> <p><strong>Context:</strong></p> <ul> <li>I’ll be using GCP credits, so cost isn’t my primary concern.</li> <li>My focus is on stability, performance, and real-world practicality when hosting Docker containers.</li> <li>I want to know which approach is more commonly used or recommended for scalability, fault tolerance, and ease of management.</li> </

Turns out I can search for photos by just describing them. I typed in “little girl with birthday cake” and boom, it pulled up exactly what I needed. I also tried “little girl with cat” and the results were close enough.</p> <p>(P.S. The album is almost done, and it’s adorable. Totally worth it!) 😊 </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=

The thing is that I want to use Home Assistant in iOS but it expects to connect directly to Home Assistant, if I try to add the subdomain URL it fails because it expects to connect directly to Home Assistant, I&#39;m having the same issue with Harbour iOS app and Portainer.
