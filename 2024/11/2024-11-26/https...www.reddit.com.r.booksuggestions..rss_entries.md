The book is historical fantasy horror about a young man who is birthed to what I think is a witch in brothel who is known to sleep with priests. The time is in the Middle Ages (I think France). The protagonist falls in love with a girl that is of a superior position, after he tries flirting with her he pisses off the prince (or some other high status authority figure) and as a punishment he gets sent off to the Crusades. He dies (I think) and is transformed into a demon, and then after a series of events he is fully transformed into a demon and flies back to his origin country and takes his lover with him. </p> <p>Again this is very vague. But it’s a fantasy historical fiction horror novel that is set in the Middle Ages in Europe and Jerusalem and it involves Witchcraft and demons (yea I think he was a demon). </p> <p>Just wanna find the name of the book</p> <p>Thanks for all the

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>As the title suggests, I&#39;ve been reading nonfiction books for years, mainly history. To be specific, I mostly read narrative history, since those books are informative while entertaining at the same time to me. Authors like Tom Holland and Dan Jones are a few examples of the genre I just mentioned. I read plenty of fantasy books when I was a teenager, but my interests have changed over the years, hence why I started to read nonfiction. The thing is, I&#39;d like to get back into fiction to expand my horizons a little. Historical narratives are fun, but even those books can become a little stale after a while, in my opinion. I&#39;m open to thrillers, horror, romance, historical fiction, anything. Some of my favorite fiction books I have read are The Pillars of The Earth, LOTR, Red Rising, Faithful, and the Fallen. As you can see, those books are mostly limited to historical or fantasy as well. I&#39;m open to something different, tho! </p> </div>

I haven&#39;t read any science fiction before, I am more of a fantasy, romcom type guy but I really like watching sci fi movies. So I wanted to try this series. Bought the first book in the series like a several months ago and started reading but I only reached upto page 30 I think, guess I got bored! Is there some specific way to get into this series?
