In today's Daily Fix:
CD Project's long-in-development The Witcher 4 game is now in "full-scale production," which the company has described as the most intense phase of game development. No other details around the game have been revealed, so we're left with just a couple of teaser images. CDPR's other projects, including another Witcher game and a new Cyberpunk entry, are still in development. In other news, Xbox is killing off the Xbox Avatars with the shutdown of the Avatar Editor app. Basically, no one was using them, and if you happened to have purchased any avatar accessories via the online store recently, you may be entitled to a refund. And finally, Amazon has released a teaser for the Concord-centric episode of Secret Level. The game may be no more, but it will live on in at least one more piece of media.

Arcane Season 2 Act III reviewed on Netflix by Rafael Motamayor. Narration by Stella Chung.

Arcane season 2 has thrilling moments of fan service – involving characters finally becoming full-on champions – and some hugely satisfying moments of romance. But even with consistently awe-inspiring animation and a stellar seventh episode, higher stakes and a much wider scope hurt the show and detract from what made the first season so special — that it always managed to bring the focus back to the characters. Arcane is one of the best animated projects of the modern age, and one of the best TV shows of the year, period. But it's hard not to do like Ekko and imagine the season that could have been if things were different with the last three episodes.
