I really enjoyed it and it came with some insight tips on improving development strategy. Particularly, I really dug the stuff about merging the inner and outer dev loop. I know development loops usually cause a poor experience for most of us when moving from inner to outer, and this had some good tips on how to fix that. </p> <p>At least in my experience, the the inner dev loop is the domain of a developer while the outer loop falls more within the wheelhouse of platform engineers. While self-sufficient teams capable of both developing an API as well as managing their infrastructure might seem ideal, it dooooes put a high demand on my teammates who have those infrastructure skills.</p> <p>And then this leads to bunch of specialized teams for API development and platform engineering (silos) plus friction when running the dev loops.",
