Smith said Trump's reelection means he cannot be tried on charges tied to the Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol or the illegal possession of classified documents stored at his Mar-a-Lago resort. Smith asked a federal appeals court to remove Trump as a defendant in the classified documents case in Florida, which is currently on appeal.",
