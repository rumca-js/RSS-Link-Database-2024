Maybe he handwaves the parts of the holy books he doesn&#39;t like away; or he thinks the Nine Hells are not actually real, just a metaphor; or he thinks the Sacraments of Sacrifice are a nice tradition, but it&#39;s really more about his personal relationship with Gorgomet; or he&#39;s disappointed a",

I did a quick search and I see some other threads discussing this, but none recently, and since we have the new show, I think it may be a good time to review this topic again, focusing on both tv series depictions. I have watched the new Dune movies and WoT show, read nothing on dune, until book 11/14 on WoT.</p> <p>Were the Aes Sedai based on or inspired by the Bene Gesserit? Basically they are both only-female &quot;witches&quot; powerful organizations, with obscure agendas, placing themselves as counselors on all relevant &quot;lords&quot;, even aspiring to put themselves on thrones (Elayne Caemlyn-Cairhien). The Bene Gesserit in Dune Prophecy appear more successful on this than Aes Sedai ever were, plus they are even more manipulative and operate yet more covertly than the White Tower. There are the issues about truth and lying",

But some magazines don\u2019t publish multi-story issues at all. And just because a venue publishes one story a week instead of four stories a month isn\u2019t cause for me to skip over them. So today, I\u2019m going to look at three short stories from the fantasy magazine and podcast <em>Podcastle</em> and three novelettes from Hugo-winning <em>Strange Horizons</em>. All six were published in 2024, but apart from that, I\u2019m skipping around with what draws my eye. </p> <h1>Podcastle</h1> <p>I honestly hadn\u2019t read <em>Podcastle</em> ",

I\u2019m looking to get into reading &amp; trying to figure out where to start. I have always been envious of people who could read books &amp; visualize everything in their minds like a movie. I would always wish I could possess that superpower, I often hear people who have read books that were turned into movies say how much better the books were. Long story short I\u2019m just trying to figure out where to start. I guess I need to decide on a genre first &amp; I think I want to start with Fantasy. I want to start slow &amp; not start with a 500 page book, something to kind of ease me in like a beginner. I was thinking maybe start with young adult books? Or should I go with kiddie books? Short stories? Just looking to get started. Any books you all can recommend would be appreciated! Thanks everyone!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted",
