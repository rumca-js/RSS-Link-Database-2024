However, surprisingly little is said about the fundamental element of programming where they meet: the function signature. As a result, overhead that can be incurred inside every function body and at every call site is not commonly recognized. Non-inlined function calls are places where the ABI specification comes into play, and its effect on the generated assembly doesn\u2019t always match expectations, even on the common platforms.\n\nIn this talk, we\u2019ll bridge the gap and provide a comprehensive list of performance pitfalls to be aware of when designing a function signature, including a compiler\u2019s view on the frequently debated questions:\n\n- returning by value or by output parameter;\n- passing parameters by value or by reference;\n- using abstractions that are commonly considered to have zero runtim",
