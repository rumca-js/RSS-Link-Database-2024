<p>The Onion Editorial Board:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>All great journalists, and even those lesser journalists who don’t
work for The Onion, eventually ponder why we do what we do. Is the
point of reporting to illuminate the world around us, so that we
may make meaning of it? Or is it to cause people in minority
groups to question their humanity and persuade others to demonize
them? We know where we stand, proudly dreaming of genitals.</p>

<p>Research shows that trans people are over four times more likely
than cisgender people to be the victim of a violent crime. We
salute our colleagues across the media who are working tirelessly
to make that number even higher.</p>

<p>Erin Woo, Sahil Patel, and Amir Efrati, reporting for The Information (paywalled, alas):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>OpenAI is preparing to launch a frontal assault on Google. The
ChatGPT owner recently considered developing a web browser that it
would combine with its chatbot, and it has separately discussed or
struck deals to power search features for travel, food, real
estate and retail websites, according to people who have seen
prototypes or designs of the products. [...]</p>

<p>Making a web browser could help OpenAI have more control over a
primary gateway through which people use the web, as well as
further boost ChatGPT, which has more than 300 million weekly
users just two years after its launch. It isn’t clear how a
ChatGPT browser’s features would differ from those of other
browsers.</p>

<p>In a signal of its interest in a browser, several months ago
OpenAI hired Ben Goodger, a founding member of the Chrome team at
Google. Another recent hire is Darin Fisher, who worked w

<p>Streaks first appeared on Daring Fireball back in 2016, and since then has won an Apple Design Award and remained one of the most well-known and effective habit-tracking apps.</p>

<p>It’s a once-off purchase, and the latest update has added seasonal themes, just in time for Christmas (and your New Year’s resolutions!).</p>

<p>If you have young children, be sure to also try Little Streaks. It’s a great way to help them focus on routines: meal-time, bed-time, learning to ride, whatever you like! It’s free for one routine, or use code “DARING” for 50% off the first year.</p>

## Apple TV’s Hardware Situation Is Fine

<p>Mark Gurman, in his weekly Power On column:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The best scenario for Apple in TV hardware would be a cheap stick
(perhaps with no physical remote — use your iPhone instead). It’s
an idea that Apple marketing executives detest, but it would help
the company quickly expand its presence. If consumers want more
power and storage, they can opt for the current box.</p>

<p>At the top of the line, Apple could offer something like the new
Mac mini, providing the best streaming quality and gaming options.
For this exercise, let’s call these three tiers the Apple TV SE,
Apple TV and Apple TV Max. It would use the same “good, better,
best” strategy employed by the iPhone, Mac, iPad, AirPods, Apple
Watch and even the Apple Pencil.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Neither of these suggestions make any sense. Streaming sticks are crap, and Apple doesn’t make crap. I also think streaming sticks are fast going the way of the dodo — they were a stopgap low-cost solution for when TV sets
