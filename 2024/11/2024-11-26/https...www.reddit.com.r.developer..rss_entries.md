<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I work for a company that creates custom landing pages for hotels. We want to add a button that allows hotel guests to automatically connect to the property WiFi network without the use of a QR code or having to get into the hotels router. </p> <p>Struggling to find a solution. Any suggestions are greatly appreciated!!! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/jbird35"> /u/jbird35 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1h0p0ju/does_this_softwaresolution_exist_for_wifi/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1h0p0ju/does_this_softwaresolution_exist_for_wifi/">[comments]</a></span>

## Developing locally and testing remotely to fix dev loop friction?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all! My co worker did a super fun talk at a recent developer conference and it was all mario kart themed/video games. I really enjoyed it and it came with some insight tips on improving development strategy. Particularly, I really dug the stuff about merging the inner and outer dev loop. I know development loops usually cause a poor experience for most of us when moving from inner to outer, and this had some good tips on how to fix that. </p> <p>At least in my experience, the the inner dev loop is the domain of a developer while the outer loop falls more within the wheelhouse of platform engineers. While self-sufficient teams capable of both developing an API as well as managing their infrastructure might seem ideal, it dooooes put a high demand on my teammates who have those infrastructure skills.</p> <p>And then this leads to bunch of specialized teams for API development and platform engineering (silos) plus friction when running the dev loops.
