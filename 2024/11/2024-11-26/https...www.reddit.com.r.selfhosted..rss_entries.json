I recently decided to begin exposing my services externally so I could have remote access to plex among other things. I use one docker host for all my containers and its all hosted on my primary LAN. After configuring my subdomain and associated DNS records I fired up a vanilla version of NPM and set my firewall to allow 80/443 and everything works perfectly. I can go to <a href=\"https://plex.mydomain.com\">https://plex.mydomain.com</a> externally and it works fine and internally also works because I created an A record for the same FQDN to point to NPM an",

I have a <a href=\"https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-zero/\">raspi pi 0</a> at home and I self host few services on it.<br/> Because omnivore is shutting down (\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d), I recently tried to deploy a wallabag instance on it, but I experience performance issues.</p> <p>First, I built and deployed a docker container based on <a href=\"https://github.com/wallabag/docker/blob/master/Dockerfile\">this dockerfile</a>. I cannot use official docker images since raspi 0 runs on armv6. Then, I tried to install it directly on the host, without docker to see if it would improve the performance.</p> <p>But in both cases, each time I&#39;m loading the webapp or the api, the <code>php-fpm</code> process takes more than 90% of CPU usage and often crashes. Is there any chance to optimize this service? Or should I just consider upgrading to a better raspi?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/aTx__r\"> /u/aTx",
