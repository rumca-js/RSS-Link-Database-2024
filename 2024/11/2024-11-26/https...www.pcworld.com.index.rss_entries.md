<p>In 2024, there’s no reason you can’t have a wireless keyboard anymore. From the most complex mechanical boards to the sleekest designer sets to the flashiest gamer machines, and everything in between, there are plenty of options for wireless excellence. That even includes keyboards for budget buyers — you can find a great pick in every category for well under three-digit prices. </p>



<p>We’ve spent hours and hours using each model, banging away on our reviews, surfing the web, and keeping up on social media to bring you a list of the very best wireless keyboards around. For example, the Logitech Keys to Go 2 <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2500996/mokibo-fusion-review.html">beats out the Mokibo Fusion</a>. These two travel boards are about the same size and the latter also includes a stand and a touchpad…but neither of those are implemented ve

<p>Do you want a huge amount of usable display space, but without the hassle of a double-monitor setup? An ultrawide monitor is the ticket. Ultrawide monitors have a wider display panel that provides an immersive experience and far more screen real-estate than your average widescreen. </p>



<p>I’ve tested a bunch of ultrawide monitors in order to name the best picks in various categories ranging from those optimized for gaming to those suited for professional use. Below you’ll find a curated list of my favorites in each category. I describe my evaluation process for monitors at the bottom of this article, or for even more details.</p>

<p>A few days ago, a new Windows 11 preview (<a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2024/11/22/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-22635-4515-beta-channel/">Build 22635.4515</a>) began rolling out to Windows 11 Insiders on the Beta Channel.</p>



<p>This new update for Insiders includes several new features and improvements, like the ability to resume OneDrive files on your PC with a single click from your phone, or new API support for third-party passkey providers to <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2437045/passkey-log-in-with-your-face-or-finger-what-to-look-out-for.html">move Windows 11 into a passwordless future</a>.</p>

<p>The Logitech MX Master series is about as good as high-quality mice get, as long as you don’t need a gaming-specific model.</p>



<p>Today, Lenovo’s online store is selling the <a href="https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/p/accessories-and-software/keyboards-and-mice/mice/78016250">MX Master 2S for just $50 with a coupon code</a>. This model is a few years old, but it’s still rare to see a new version going for less than about $70. It’s a fantastic deal.</p>



<p>The Logitech MX Master 2S features a sculpted body with premium materials, a super-fast ball bearing metal scroll wheel, and customizable thumb buttons with a second horizontal scroll. Its 4,000 DPI “Darkfield” sensor works on just about any surface, including glass. (The mouse’s curvy body won’t work for left-handed users, but otherwise it’s just about perfect for people who use their computers a lot

<p>When you need a powerful computer that isn’t as bulky as a desktop PC and doesn’t need to be portable like a laptop, you need a mini PC. These tiny things pack so much power, they’ll blow you away.</p>



<p>And there’s never been a better time to snag one because <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beelink-EQR6-Computer-Graphics-Display/dp/B0CY27348C/">this Beelink EQR6 mini PC is now just $349 on Amazon</a>, a remarkable 30 percent off its usual price tag of $500.</p>



<p>So, what’s in this tiny thing? Well, for starters, you have an AMD Ryzen 9 6900HX CPU, a high-performance processor that can easily handle any demanding task you throw its way. It also has AMD Radeon 680M integrated graphics, which is perfectly capable of modest gaming and creative work like video editing.</p>

<p>The Windows tool Diskpart overwrites all data on the hard drive with a zero, which is considered a secure deletion method. This applies at least to classic hard drives, i.e. HDDs with magnetic discs.</p>



<p>To delete a hard drive with Diskpart, start the command prompt with administrator rights. To do this, enter <strong>cmd</strong> in the Windows search and then select <em>Command Prompt > Run as administrator</em>.</p>



<p>Enter the command <strong>diskpart</strong> in the new window. Diskpart is an interactive tool. You do not control it via parameters, but by entering commands, which you then confirm by pressing the Enter key.</p>

<p>Stop what you’re doing and check out this Samsung Odyssey OLED G8 deal because it’s just <em>crazy</em> — now $551 off for Black Friday, you can <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-DisplayHDR-FreeSync-Streaming-LS34BG850SNXZA/dp/B0BLF2RWNV/">get this 34-inch OLED gaming monitor for $649 on Amazon</a>.</p>



<p>This Odyssey OLED G8 has a 34-inch display with a 2560×1440 resolution that delivers a 175Hz refresh rate and 0.03ms response time for the smoothest gaming visuals with no dropped frames or lag.

<p>Is it possible to have enough chargers? I don’t think so! I know how often I’m looking for one only for them to have vanished into nothing (and somehow reappear hours later). You can never have too many, especially when they’re among the better ones.</p>



<p>Right now, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/iPhone-Charger-Anker-AirPods-Included/dp/B0C8HHV9DK/">Anker’s two-pack of USB-C chargers and cables is just under $13 on Amazon</a>. This is a solid Black Friday deal, cutting the price by 32 percent down to its all-time best price.</p>



<p>These charging blocks deliver 20W power output and feature two ports each: 1 x USB-A and 1 x USB-C. It’s the USB-C port that provides 20W charging, while the USB-A port caps out at 18W output. If you use both ports at the same time, both drop to 15W — obviously less, but not so much as to be unusable. Not an issue in m

<p>Portable solid-state drives are great, offering lots of storage and faster speeds than a USB flash drive while in a still-portable package. People often use them to <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407021/best-windows-backup-software.html">back up their PCs with backup software</a>.</p>



<p>But portable SSDs aren’t <em>just</em> for backups.
