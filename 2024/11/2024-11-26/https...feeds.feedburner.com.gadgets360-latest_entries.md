Flowers of Hypenia macrantha in Brazil have been observed using an intriguing strategy to boost their chances of successful pollination. These blooms, which feature both male and female reproductive organs, employ a pollen catapult mechanism. When hummingbirds visit during the flower's male phase, the plant releases a burst of pollen, knocking off any existing pollen from the bird’s beak. This forces the hummingbird to carry the flower’s own pollen to the next bloom, rather than that of a competitor.
