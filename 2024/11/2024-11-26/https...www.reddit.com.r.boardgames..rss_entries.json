Her favorite hero that she played was Dr Strange from a friend who had it, but evidently he&#39;s very tough to find because he was one of the first heroes in print. I live in a small town with only 1 lgs and ours is fresh out of Strange. Was wondering if any of you could keep an eye out for the hero pack next time you stop by your lgs/ barnes and noble! I&#39;d love to get it for my girlfriend with Xmas around the corner! I&#39;d happily pay for shipping plus extra for your troubles! I hope I didn&#39;t violate any rules or anything with this post!

Our game group is very comfortable with heavy games so that isn&#39;t an issue. The only other options I see people recommend seem to be Civ A New Dawn, Clash of Cultures, and Through the Ages. I know Terra Incognita supposedly fixes a lot with A New Dawn but I really didn&#39;t like the base game and sold it, Clash of Cultures seems to be OOP, and Through the Ages is apparently akin to Twilight Imperium in length.
