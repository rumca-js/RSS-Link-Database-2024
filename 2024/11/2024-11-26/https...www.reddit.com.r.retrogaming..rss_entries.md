The player can just be idling or whatever as long as nothing is interrupting the scene so it can just go on indefinitely without any annoyances like sound effects blaring.</p> <p>I&#39;m not against using a cheats to disable timers if it&#39;s particularly good otherwise.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Vulkanon"> /u/Vulkanon </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1h0i6xb/games_screensavers_suggestions/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com
