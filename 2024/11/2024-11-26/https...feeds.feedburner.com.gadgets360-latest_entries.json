        "description": "Flowers of Hypenia macrantha in Brazil have been observed using an intriguing strategy to boost their chances of successful pollination. These blooms, which feature both male and female reproductive organs, employ a pollen catapult mechanism. When hummingbirds visit during the flower's male phase, the plant releases a burst of pollen, knocking off any existing pollen from the bird\u2019s beak. This forces the hummingbird to carry the flower\u2019s own pollen to the next bloom, rather than that of a competitor.",

Recent findings link its origins to the ancient Tethys Ocean and mantle changes caused by tectonic plate shifts. Researchers used advanced models to simulate the geological processes, revealing low-density magma plumes beneath the area.",

Scientists determined that tar, derived from rockrose (Cistus ladanifer), was created in a layered fire pit designed specifically for this purpose. The tar was used to bind stone tools to wooden shafts, demonstrating resourceful adaptation to available materials. The discovery suggests advanced organisational skills and complex technological behaviours among Neanderthals.",
