								<p>Thanks to publisher Renegade Studios, there's been a copy of review sample of HeroScape Age of Annihilation: Battle of the Wellspring in my house for over a month. It’s an entry level wargame slash <strong>boardgame</strong> designed for youngsters and their grownups, and though it <em>has</em> made it to the table several times, not once have I been able to play a game - because my daughter loves it as a toy too much.</p>

								<p>While the <b>Ranger 5e</b> was originally considered one of Dungeons and Dragons’ weakest classes, a lot has changed in the good year 2024. The <b>DnD 2024 Ranger</b> is still a spell-slinging survival expert who’s as adept with archery as they are with animal handling. However, the newer woodland warrior has seen some quality-of-life tweaks that make them more consistent overall. This guide explains these new Ranger rules.</p>
<p>If you’re still looking to play a Ranger 5e with the 2014 rules, the linked guide can help you out. Or, if you’re after DnD classes with a different feel, head to our full guide for a thorough explainer.</p>

								<p><strong>Magic: The Gathering</strong> has slowly been drip-feeding spoilers for the 20 Ways to Win Commander deck, and the gradual pace of these reveals is providing even more time for the disappointment to sink in. It almost annoys me that this pile of cards will probably sell out on day one.</p>

								<p>Of all the many and varied fantasy worlds to arise from <strong>Dungeons and Dragons</strong>, Dark Sun is one of the most sinister, morally compromised, and compelling. It’s a personal favorite, but as much as I want new supplements set in this world so that new fans can discover it, I simply don’t have faith in the current DnD brand to handle a setting which draws so much of its strength from moral horrors and challenging ideas.</p>
