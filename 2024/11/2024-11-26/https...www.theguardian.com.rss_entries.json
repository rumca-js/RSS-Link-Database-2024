It\u2019s an engaging watch, but it\u2019s let down a bit by the convenient ending facilitated by a slightly unfocused melodramatic finale.</p><p>The setting is S\u00e3o Paulo, where a youth volleyball team is poised to win a championship. The star player is 17-year-old Sof\u00eda (Ayomi Domenica Dias), who is herself about to clinch a life-changing sports scholarship. (The \u201cpower alley\u201d of the title means a thrilling cross-court shot that travels from one corner of the court to the opponents\u2019 corner; the film\u2019s original title, Levante, means \u201crise up\u201d.) But Sof\u00eda is pregnant, which could change everything \u2013 and there are serious legal obstacles to getting abortions in Brazil.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/nov/26/power-alley-levante",
