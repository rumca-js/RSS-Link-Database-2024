I don\u2019t think so! I know how often I\u2019m looking for one only for them to have vanished into nothing (and somehow reappear hours later). You can never have too many, especially when they\u2019re among the better ones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right now, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/iPhone-Charger-Anker-AirPods-Included/dp/B0C8HHV9DK/\">Anker\u2019s two-pack of USB-C chargers and cables is just under $13 on Amazon</a>. This is a solid Black Friday deal, cutting the price by 32 percent down to its all-time best price.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These charging blocks deliver 20W power output and feature two ports each: 1 x USB-A and 1 x USB-C. It\u2019s the USB-C port that provides 20W charging, while the USB-A port caps out at 18W output. If you use both ports at the same time, both drop to 15W \u2014 obviously less, but not so much as to be unusable. Not an issue in m",

People often use them to <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/407021/best-windows-backup-software.html\">back up their PCs with backup software</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But portable SSDs aren\u2019t <em>just</em> for backups. Even if you prefer using <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/407149/online-cloud-backup-services-carbonite-idrive-backblaze-livedrive.html\">online backup software</a> and don\u2019t plan on backing up anything to a physical drive, there are lots of great reasons to have a compact, portable SSD on hand. Here are some especially useful uses to consider.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/4",
