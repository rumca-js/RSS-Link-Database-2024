<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey! I&#39;m a newbie to anime. I mean I&#39;ve watched all of the movies from <strong>Studio Ghibli</strong> and also <strong>Jujutsu Kaisen</strong> but beside that I did not watch any other stuff. I just finished watching Hell&#39;s Paradise and I fell in love with it. Does anyone know anything that is similar to it? I am looking for something with strange creatures, same art style, good storyline, mystery, plot twist,... something that gives the vibe of Studio Ghibli.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Been a fan of FLCL since the first watch. Upon it, it was just a random, fun anime which I found through an even more random AMV (to Hoobastank&#39;s &quot;The Reason&quot;, it&#39;s on Youtube). Later on I re-watched it and deep dove into it&#39;s lore and explanations. </p> <p>I loved Progressive and Alternative; they were a fun spin with different MC&#39;s and I quite liked the messages behind both.<br/> Realized I have yet to see two more &quot;sequels&quot; (Grunge and Shoegaze). Grunge seems like a universal FLCL-fan flop (it&#39;s mostly the style, it burns my eyes and pops out unnecessarily instead of keeping it all 2-D) but 2nd episode seems better than the first. </p> <p>I&#39;ve yet to see Shoegaze (after this one, I presume). </p> <p><a href="/r/anime">r/anime</a>, what are your thoughts on FLCL as a whole, and especially on the latest two entries?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/RPGO
