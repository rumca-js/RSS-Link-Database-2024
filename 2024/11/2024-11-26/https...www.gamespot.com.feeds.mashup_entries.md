<p>It just became way less of a hassle to launch 2K games from your Steam library. The publisher has officially removed its launcher from every game that used it on Steam (and the Epic Games Store). The removal went through on November 18, but a follow-up update to ensure the Launcher was fully removed dropped on November 25.</p><p>Many games, including Bioshock Remastered, Marvel's Midnight Suns, and The Quarry, will now launch directly through Steam. Other games used the launcher for additional functionality. Those games will now launch a small submenu before opening the game itself.</p><p>For example, XCOM 2 and XCOM: Chimera Squad used the 2K launcher for mod management. Now, launching the game will open a small menu which will let you open the mod launcher or the selected game directly. For both games, this change lets you install and use mods on Steam Deck, though the Chimera Squad menu may have some graphical and interface glitches on the portable device.</p><a href="https://w

And what is the status of the previously announced new Cyberpunk anime for Netflix?</p><p>CD Projekt management <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6pJrtfZoxY">said on an earnings call today</a>, November 26, that the Cyberpunk 2077 live-action project remains in the conceptual stage, but it has progressed beyond where it was a year ago when it was announced. However, management confirmed it's not yet being shopped to potential streamers/studios, but that could happen as soon as within the next 12 months.</p><p>In terms of the funding for the concept, CD Projekt is funding this--but not the full project if and when it goes into production.

<p>Australia has built a reputation as having one of the strictest video game rating systems on the planet, and it appears as though another highly anticipated game won't reach the country's shores when it's released next year.</p><p>Hunter x Hunter Nen x Impact, the fighting game based on the popular anime, has been refused classification by the Australian Classification Board (ACB), officially preventing the game from being sold in the country. The group listed no reason for the decision, but with the ACB having set a precedent with other games with similar ratings, and the reasoning behind them, it could be a few possibilities.</p><p>The main suspected reason is how drug use has a gameplay benefit, like granting speed or strength, or portraying drug use in a positive light. For example, if a character even gets health restored from narcotics, that game would likely be refused classification (RC). Disco Elysium: The Final Cut was originally banned because of this, but that decision
