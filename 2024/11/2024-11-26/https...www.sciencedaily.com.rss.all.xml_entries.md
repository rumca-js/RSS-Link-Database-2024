A new article examines the convergence of physics, chemistry, and AI, highlighted by recent Nobel Prizes. It traces the historical development of neural networks, emphasizing the role of interdisciplinary research in advancing AI. The authors advocate for nurturing AI-enabled polymaths to bridge the gap between theoretical advancements and practical applications, driving progress toward artificial general intelligence.

## The link between sleep and blood pressure: New research sheds light on gender differences

You may have heard sleep described as something of a magic pill for the body. With the right amount, timing, and quality, it can work wonders -- strengthen the immune system, improve blood sugar, even decrease the risk of heart attacks and strokes. Sleep differences have been reported for some time in men and women, but it is not well known whether the characteristics of sleep serve different functions in one gender over the other, especially as it relates to the heart. New research seeks answers.

## Improved catalyst turns harmful greenhouse gases into cleaner fuels, chemical feedstocks

A chemical reaction can convert two polluting greenhouse gases into valuable building blocks for cleaner fuels and feedstocks, but the high temperature required for the reaction also deactivates the catalyst. A team has found a way to thwart deactivation. The strategy may apply broadly to other catalysts.

## Simple lab-free test to detect bacteria in fluids from water to urine

Researchers share a mathematical model created to capture the nonlinear relationships between CO2, temperature, human population, and crop growth. Increasing evidence of chaotic and complex dynamics within ecological systems led them to use both autonomous and nonautonomous models to gain a deeper understanding of seasonal variations and potential mitigation strategies, such as developing temperature-tolerant crops.

## New era in amphibian biology

Amphibians hold a significant place in evolution, representing the transition from aquatic to terrestrial lifestyles. They are crucial for understanding the brain and spinal cord of tetrapods -- animals with four limbs, including humans. A group of scientists now shows how harmless viruses can be used to illuminate the development of the frog nervous system.
