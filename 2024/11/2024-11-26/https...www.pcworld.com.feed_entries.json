Here we point out the top accessories you will want after you bag a new phone. On the list are no-brainer essentials to keep your phone safe, like a screen protector and a phone case, but you\u2019ll also find other items to make using your smartphone as easy as pie, like a phone stand and Bluetooth earbuds. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of phones don\u2019t come with cable chargers nowadays so you might want to pick up a wireless charger (which is a more convenient way to charge your phone) while the Black Friday sales are on. If you\u2019ve already got one, a good power bank and car charger are recommended to keep your phone juiced up when you\u2019re on the road. But enough talk\u2026 it\u2019s time to jump in and browse the list!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"top-1",
