<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So for whatever reason me and my boyfriend are at odds about the sound of the cantina music. To me, it sounds like it starts low, and goes up and goes down and goes back up before it continues on with the song, but my boyfriend INSISTS he&#39;s hearing something different. He says it starts on the high note and goes DOWN. We listened to like 15 different versions of it, and even listened to it in slow motion. We&#39;re clearly hearing two different things. I even consulted the sheet music which confirmed that it starts low and goes up, but to no avail &gt;:( What do you guys hear??</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/noodlebread7"> /u/noodlebread7 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1h0f6w6/do_the_first_two_notes_of_the_starwars_cantina/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1h0f6w6/do_the_first_two_notes_of_the_starwars_cantina/
