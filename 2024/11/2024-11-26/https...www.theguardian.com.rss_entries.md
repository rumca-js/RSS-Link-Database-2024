<p>Manchester City’s losing sequence is over – just. But they are still a listing ship that can go down at any moment.</p><p>From 3-0 up after 75 minutes, a late horror show ceded the advantage as Feyenoord preyed on home nerves via Anis Hadj Moussa, Santiago Giménez and David Hancko, who drew ­Feyenoord level to earn a well-fought point.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/26/manchester-city-feyenoord-champions-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Sunderland extended their unbeaten run to 10 games but, as the smattering of gentle boos that greeted the final whistle testified, it was most certainly not a cause for celebration on Wearside.</p><p>Instead a fifth straight draw, against highly efficient if somewhat unambitious opponents well practised at pinching ostensibly unlikely points, saw Régis Le Bris’s early season pace setters slip to third in the Championship. West Brom’s reward for the obduracy that so frustrated increasingly frustrated Stadium of Light season ticket holders was a drop to seventh in a ­fascinating second tier.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/26/sunderland-west-brom-championship-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This was some response to charges of being shot shy. Arsenal’s lack of cutting edge on foreign trips had been the pre-match talking point but it turned out they had saved up a hiding for the continent’s form team.</p><p>Sporting had no answer to a masterful first-half display that was reflected accurately by strikes from Gabriel Martinelli, Kai Havertz and Gabriel Magalhães, all of whom exposed a grievously flaky backline. While the hosts were given hope by Gonçalo Inácio early in a more competitive second period they had too much to do. Arsenal went back through the gears when it mattered, Bukayo Saka’s penalty and a Leandro Trossard header dealing their ambitions of swift passage to the knockout stage a significant boost.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/26/sporting-arsenal-champions-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

Thoroughbred racehorses know how to time their run. That Bayern Munich, Real Madrid, Atlético Madrid, Milan, Benfica and Paris Saint-Germain started this week behind Celtic in the newfangled version of European football’s premier club competition is likely to prove a temporary impasse. Celtic, despite a hugely promising start, were 15th before Tuesday evening’s fixtures.

But this is the premise of the deliriously funny The Play That Goes Wrong, about a hapless am-dram troupe staging a whodunnit.</p><p>Despite having its premiere in a tiny room above a London pub, there is nothing amateurish about the Olivier award-winning comedy – one of the longest-running shows currently in the West End. It spawned a franchise of “Goes Wrong” farces on stage, as well as a dazzlingly inventive TV series, and catapulted the creators, Mischief Theatre, to international glory. The play is on in

So when his father, a minister, was given 20 acres of land by a member of his congregation, he built her one in North Carolina. “Literally with his bare hands,” Collins-Black says. On sweltering days, the young Collins-Black would chase lizards, sneak up on snakes, and dig holes. On balmy nights, he’d wonder what he might find the next day. Still, closest to his heart were his days spent at the Emerald Hollow Mine, a 20-minute drive away at the foot of the Brushy Mountains. There, he’d sift in the creek and poke through the dirt on the hunt for treasure.</p><p>Over three decades later, Collins-Black has <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DCRkbMhASGm/?hl=en">kicked off</a> a

<p>After weeks of astonishing performances and easy wit, the comic is the bookies’ favourite to win. He talks about the privilege of being the first blind person to appear – and how his daughter changed his outlook on life</p><p>For quite a while, Chris McCausland kept turning down the offer to appear on Strictly Come Dancing. He wasn’t going to do it this year either. “It terrified me,” he says. “I don’t mind stretching myself, but I have to know something’s possible.” And Strictly seemed impossible. Blind since his early 20s, McCausland spent his teenage years listening to 90s grunge and throwing himself around mosh pits rather than paying any attention to ballroom dancing. So he had no idea what an American smooth or a paso doble even looked like. For some, Strictly has been unavoidable for the last 20 years, but McCausland, 47, a comedian whose natural TV home is shows such as Would I Lie to You?, says the first time he ever heard the theme tune was when he was standing in the st

<p>The former German chancellor’s book Freedom gives insights on Brexit and her East German upbringing</p><p>Angela Merkel was notoriously discreet and privacy-conscious as Germany’s chancellor, rarely veering off message during her 16 years in office.</p><p>In her eagerly anticipated political autobiography <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/freedom-9781035020751/">Freedom: Memoirs 1954-2021</a>, she has hardly turned into a gossipmonger overnight. But across 721 pages – published on Tuesday in German and English thanks to nine different translators working on chunks of the book simultaneously – there are glimpses of a Merkel previously unseen.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/26/regrets-feminism-trump-putin-key-takeways-angela-merkel-memoir-freedom">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In 2004, 29 people were killed by members of the Cinta Larga tribe in Brazil’s Amazon basin. The story shocked the country – but the truth of what happened is still being fought over</p><p>At the federal courthouse of Vilhena, in the southern reaches of the Amazon basin, Nacoça Pio Cinta Larga limped to his seat, using one hand to steady himself on a table. In the air-conditioned chill and fluorescent glare, his crown of black and brown feathers shuddered with each step, a lonely reminder of the rainforest beyond the white-painted walls. A Brazilian flag hung limply in one corner, the national motto, “Order and progress”, concealed in its folds. “The prosecution says that, on 7 April 2004, around 11am in the Gully of Tranquility, you, sir, together with other members of your tribe, took the lives of several prospectors,” Judge Rafael Slomp began.</p><p>Pale even for a white man, Slomp wore a pink button-up shirt beneath his robes. His goatee was immaculately trimmed, his tone blan

<p>While Palestinians are fleeing the war, one group of Israelis are planning for beachfront homes on the strip. <strong>Bethan McKernan</strong> and <strong>Ruth Michaelson</strong> report</p><p>For weeks people living in northern Gaza, like <strong>Dr</strong> <strong>Mohammad Salha</strong>, have been sheltering from a renewed offensive by Israel. Israel has told civilians to leave, and food and humanitarian aid has stopped. Salha is the acting director of the al-Awda hospital – and has stayed behind to treat patients. He says there is only one surgeon left to do life-saving operations in the area, and food, medicines and electricity are vanishingly scarce. He has watched as thousands have fled, including his family. It is not clear when they will be allowed to return or if they ever will.</p><p>Yet just over the border from Gaza, one group of far-right Israelis have a plan. Settlers from the Nachala organisation have held a conference in the closed military zone of the strip’s pe

<p>The former German chancellor slights her enemies by barely mentioning them – and is frustratingly opaque on her own big calls</p><p>Towards the end of her 16-year tenure, former German chancellor Angela Merkel was garlanded with superlative titles: the “queen of Europe”, the “most powerful woman in the world”, the “leader of the free world”. In reality, her role was always more that of a mediator than a sovereign. Born and brought up for 35 years in an anti-church, Moscow-allied socialist command economy but politically active for 31 years in a Christian, staunchly pro-Nato and pro-market conservative party, Merkel’s unique political calling card was her ability to see eye-to-eye with politicians from opposing camps, because she understood their ideological hinterland.</p><p>And so Freedom, released just three years after she left office, was never going to be a score-settling kind of autobiography. Meetings with politicians as different as George W Bush and former leftwing Greek
