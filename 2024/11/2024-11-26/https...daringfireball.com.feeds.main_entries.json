Is the\npoint of reporting to illuminate the world around us, so that we\nmay make meaning of it? Or is it to cause people in minority\ngroups to question their humanity and persuade others to demonize\nthem? We know where we stand, proudly dreaming of genitals.</p>\n\n<p>Research shows that trans people are over four times more likely\nthan cisgender people to be the victim of a violent crime. We\nsalute our colleagues across the media who are working tirelessly\nto make that number even higher.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to \u2018\u2018It Is Journalism\u2019s Sacred Duty to Endanger the Lives of as Many Trans People as Possible\u2019\u2019\"  href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/11/26/onion-trans-endangerment\">&nbsp;\u2605&nbsp;</a>\n</div>\n\n\t",
