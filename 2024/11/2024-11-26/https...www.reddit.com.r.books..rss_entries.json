The overall story was good but I had a few gripes with it. </p> <ol> <li><p>Mouse\u2019s breakup with her boyfriend was completely irrelevant and should have cut it out. I completely forgot about it until it was brought up again when she was at the coffee shop. Like I get adding backstories but this wasn\u2019t needed. </p></li> <li><p>What was up with phone call to the secret society/ the weird people who were at the funeral? The weird people at the funeral kept getting brought up but it didn\u2019t add much to the story. The dad already said it was a closed casket and that Cotgrave died outside so she could have put the \u201cbig twist\u201d together without having the hint from the guy on the phone. </p></l",

Even if they were in love with someone or with groups of people, they couldn\u2019t fully connect.</p></li> <li><p>The real love story was Gus and Call. Not in a romantic way, but in each other they found home and purpose. They were each other\u2019s person.</p></li> <li><p>Gus sent Call back to Lonesome Dove to give him one last purpose and adventure. He knew he\u2019d need it</p></li> <li><p>Names. Seems pretty important. Call couldn\u2019t say Maggie\u2019s name nor give Newts his. They asked Deets to come up with a first name, but didn\u2019t call him by it. Most had nicknames. Why was this such a relevant theme?</p></li> <li><p>The last line. Why that line? Again, didn\u2019t use the name Lorena, but just whore. Why? </p></li> <li><p>Did Po know all that might happen?</p></li> </ol> <p>Again, loved it and looking for a place to spur discussion. Pun intended. Als",
