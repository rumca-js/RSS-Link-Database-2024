This is one of the latest of many steps that U.S. policymakers have taken to protect the United States\u2019 economic security. Under the first Trump administration, Washington placed restrictions on the telecom companies ZTE and Huawei. President Joe Biden has maintained many of Trump\u2019s policies toward China\u00a0and advanced new ones, including initiating broad export controls in late 2022 on advanced semiconductors and semiconductor equipment. As the incoming Trump administration appears ready to accelerate and expand these restrictions further still, it\u2019s worth considering the track record of these policies\u2014and take stock of the tradeoffs that they entail.",
