<p class="has-text-align-none">Heading into <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> is a bit of a shock for longtime fans who have been following the fantasy franchise since its earlier days. The game doesn’t use the Dragon Age Keep, an app that players could use to track their past decisions made in other Dragon Age games — decisions that could end up paying off in unexpected ways in a new title. This browser app allowed players to whip up a save state by going over both major and minor decisions that could then influence events in a forthcoming game. But <em>Veilguard</

<p class="has-text-align-none">Back in May I remarked how board game releases in 2024 had gotten off to a slow start. That was before the summer and fall convention season, which brought with it a deluge of promising new titles. We are in full swing now, and there is an astounding quantity of exceptional new board games.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> doesn’t have the same broad, sweeping choices at the end of every chapter as its predecessors, but it does spend quite a bit of time allowing the player to figure out how they feel about their Rook. Does your Rook believe in the Maker, the Dragon Age equivalent of God? What’s your Rook’s favorite coffee, or are they more of a tea enjoyer? One route that surprised me is that you can establish your Rook as trans and/or nonbinary, and dialogue options relating to that are sprinkled throughout the game in unexpected places.</p>
