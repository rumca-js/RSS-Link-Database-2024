My question is: can this bonus focus be used to pay for the spell in question?</p> <p>When it comes to spells, focus from unused dice can be used to pay for the spell immediately, even if focus on the player mat would be insufficient on its own, is the same true for Phoenix bonus focus?</p> <p>Example: I have 3 focus on my mat. The spell costs 6 focus. I roll a successful skill check and have 2 additional focus from unused dice. This adds up to 5 focus. I also have 2 of the Phoenix gear set.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I was recently rereading my grandfather&#39;s memoirs of his time in the 81st Field Artillery Battalion and their role in the Battle of the Bulge, and I thought it would be interesting to step into his shoes somewhat and play a war game about it. I&#39;m new to war games, especially chit and hex types, but I have played squad/skirmish miniatures games. I think I want something closer to squad scale (if not exactly that small), but perhaps there&#39;s something particularly good or better suited to the battle at bigger scale. I&#39;m specifically looking for games that can be played solo, since my usual group isn&#39;t likely to play with me, but I did have the idea to try playing against an AI model if I can upload pics of the board state.
