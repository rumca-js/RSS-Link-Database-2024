They interview devs about Open Source projects, and they also have a weekly news episode that I always listen to. 5 years ago, I interviewed them for their 10th anniversary episode, and now I'm back catching up on what they've been doing for the past 5 years.\n\nWe talk about:\n- How open source is changing\n- Open data and open LLM models\n- Self-reliance and self-hosted infrastructure\n- The business of running a developer community\n\nCan you guess what song I'm playing in the intro?\n\nAlso, I want to thank the 10,993 kind people who support our charity each month, and who make this podcast possible.
