A new study proposes that black holes could hold the key to dark energy, which fuels the accelerating expansion of the universe. Using the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), astronomers observed a possible correlation between the growth of black holes and an increase in dark energy. The study's co-authors, Gregory Tarlé and Duncan Farrah, highlight this theory as an intriguing potential answer to cosmology’s "Hubble tension," which points to varied cosmic expansion rates.

Chinese researchers have, for the first time, reprogrammed a woman’s fat cells to become insulin-producing pancreatic cells, reversing her need for insulin injections for over a year. In this study, fat cells were chemically reverted into stem-like cells and transformed into islet cells, which are normally found in the pancreas. The cells, implanted into the patient’s abdomen, regulated blood sugar without insulin. This new method could lead to alternative treatment paths for type 1 diabetes, removing the dependency on insulin injections and donor organs.
