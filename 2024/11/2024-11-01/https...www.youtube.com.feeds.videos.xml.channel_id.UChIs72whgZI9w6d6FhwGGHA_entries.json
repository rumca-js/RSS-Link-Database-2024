Each kit includes 7 tabletop gaming dice, a 3-part high-quality wooden dice box, an integrated dice rolling tray, an included playing card (the Inductor set gets a Goblin Creature Token that Andrew & Steve designed; the Snowflake set gets a 'Snowflake, Heedless One' possibly overpowered cat card), and an RNG treasure table. The sets include a D20, D12, D10, D00 (percentile), D8, D6, and D4, for 7 total.\n\nFor the f", "id": 1429873, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdYGFpE1KTs", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 428, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UChIs72whgZI9w6d6FhwGGHA", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/bdYGFpE1KTs/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "GamersNexus Breaks Into Tabletop Gaming", "vote": 0}]
