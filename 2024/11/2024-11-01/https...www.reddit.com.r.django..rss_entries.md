<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>tldr how are you writing tests for parts of the code that are requiring ORM?</p> <p>Hiya,</p> <p>I am new to Django and looking for guidance in the area of the structuring tests.</p> <p>Component that I am working now is built on top of Netbox, but with a lot of custom code and features squeezed into plugins.</p> <p>As the code quality of the plugins is really bad, management came up with the goal of 85% statements coverage (I know, dumb as hell, especially as big chunk of this code is garbage and will be thrown out as soon as it is safe to do). So we have to write a lot of &quot;unit tests&quot; (actually I don&#39;t think they need to be unit, they just need to generate coverage).</p> <p>Okay, so wanted to start with &quot;classic&quot; unit tests, meaning no IO, everything happening in memory. First problem is that almost every method is either querying or saving something to DB. One of the colleagues started mocking every ORM call, like the retur

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>The <code>LoginRequiredMiddleware</code> (new in Django 5.1) is great for any Django app that is mostly behind authentication. When enabled, views will require login by default. No more <code>login_required</code> decorators everywhere!</p> <p>So how do you make a view <em>not</em> require login?</p> <p>Use the new <code>login_not_required</code> decorator! This works just like the <code>login_required</code> decorator but for the opposite: any view it decorates will bypass the login requirement and be public. Be sure to put it on your login page otherwise you might get caught in redirect loops!</p> <p>If you&#39;re building an app that mostly requires login, using the <code>LoginRequiredMiddleware</code> is a great way to simplify code and prevent accidentally leaking contentâ€”by making your app private by default.</p> <p>Read more in the documentation here: <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/ref/middleware/#django.contrib.auth.middleware
