<p>Even with the US economy doing well by most measures, technology job seekers often find it difficult to get hired. It’s a conundrum.</p>

<p>When we talk about Android customization, we tend to focus on the home screen and the ocean of <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/1723954/android-launchers-for-enhanced-efficiency.html">exceptional Android launchers</a> that let you take total control of that environment.</p>



<p>But the beauty of Android is that the opportunity for making your phone work the way <em>you</em> want isn’t limited to any one area of the operating system. Unlike with that (cough, cough) <em>other</em> smartphone platform, you can customize and control practically every part of the Android experience to make it exactly right for <em>you</em> — instead of being forced to blindly follow the path some swe

<p>While lawyers argue in the WP Engine versus Automattic litigation whether the hyperbole should be believed, the continuing battle of words, almost all nasty ones, is starting to raise doubts how much an enterprise should rely on open source. And even if open source can be avoided at all in late 2024.</p>



<p>The latest legal documents came from Automattic, which argued that its people did nothing wrong and that the blame lies solely with WP Engine. This arrived after <a href="https://www.cio.com/article/3545272/things-get-nasty-in-lawsuit-between-wordpress-org-and-wp-engine.html">months of a wide range of heated comments</a> from both sides.</p>
