<p>This week’s budget provided an emergency injection of cash for struggling councils.

<p>The former England youth player recently scored her first competitive goal in over five years after an injury nightmare</p><p>Four minutes into Ellie Brazil’s Charlton debut, the moment came. It was a tap-in from inside the six-yard box, but who cares? Brazil thrust her arms by her side in celebration and jumped with glee. This meant more than any ordinary goal. It was the former England youth international’s first competitive goal for more than five years, after fighting back from not one but two anterior cruciate ligament injuries.</p><p>Brazil had endured the cruel misfortune of separate injuries in each leg, first when playing for Brighton in November 2019, then with Tottenham in October 2022, but has a remarkably positive mindset. Of what it was like in the summer when looking for a club, the 25-year-old says: “I had the status on my head, I can’t deny it: ‘Ellie’s done two ACLs, she hasn’t played for a couple of years.’ So it was really difficult to find the club that sold i

Sunderland supporters could have been forgiven for feeling a little underwhelmed at the appointment given their club had been linked (somewhat unrealistically) with Graham Potter and Steve Cooper, as well as the elusive Anglo-Belgian tactician Will Still. Le Bris landed in the Stadium of Light instead and even those familiar with his work harboured major doubts, given he’d just been relegated from Ligue 1 with Lorient.

After rescuing Newcastle from seemingly near-certain relegation in his first season, a fourth-placed finish in 2022-23 secured Champions League qualification at the end of a campaign when the club lost the Carabao Cup final to Manchester United. If multiple injuries proved largely responsible for last term’s mildly disappointing seventh place, fears the former Bournemouth manager could be approaching the end of his St James’ Park shelf life have surfaced after five Premier League games without a win, a slide to 12th and the scoring of only nine goals in nine league games.

They’re Islamic windows.” I look, as he urges, at the unglassed stone windows from Agra that are installed all around us in the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum’s South Asia gallery. If you have ever visited it, you will have seen them, but not everyone looks as closely as Khan. “Look at the repetition,” he says. “You can see it in all these patterns.”</p><p>He means this as praise – and it’s easy to see the beauty of that apparently infinite repetition.

As Rachel Reeves listed the infrastructure projects being funded by her first budget, she could not even say how much the biggest one would cost. She announced a £22.6bn cash injection for the NHS in England over two years and an extra £2.3bn a year in core funding for English schools. Television showed the relevant ministers cheering to the skies. But when she mentioned a <a href="https://www.railmagazine.com/news/2024/10/30/chancellor-confirms-hs2-trains-will-run-to-euston">certain railway tunnel</a> from Old Oak Common to Euston in London, the transport secretary, Louise Haigh, was not cheering.

<p>Before England’s All Blacks clash, the prop faces the sport’s problems and describes his passion for community work</p><p>There are refreshingly forthright rugby players and then, several laps out in front, there is Ellis Genge. How, for example, does England’s returning vice-captain rate the current financial stability of the professional club game beneath the national team? “I think it’s shit or bust, to be honest,” he replies, bluntly. “It’s either going to go one way or another … something’s got to give.”</p><p>Strong words from our man at the sharp end ahead of a big autumn for the sport. And what about the untimely calf injury that led to him missing England’s summer tour to Japan and New Zealand? “I’ve never had a calf issue in my life. It was 28 minutes into the last game of the season in May, in a scrum. That shouldn’t happen.” He believes the blame lies with those forcing top players to plough ever onwards for club and country with minimal rest. “Boys getting run into th

<p>The author confronts her own mortality with candour and crisp humour in this thoughtful exploration of bullfighting</p><p>Ostensibly an exploration of the Spanish <em>corrida de toros</em>, On Bullfighting begins with a confession. Its author AL Kennedy reveals how, prior to starting the book, she attempted suicide during a bout of depression. What stopped her from jumping to her death was music, specifically the sound of a man tunelessly singing “what has always been my least favourite folk song in all the world, Mairi’s Wedding … Murdering myself to this accompaniment is more than I can bear.”</p><p>Why is she telling us this? Because she has faced death and her book is “about people who risk death for a living”. What occurs in the bullring isn’t really a fight, she adds, since no man “can actually fight half a ton or so of bull. It is more complicated, repellent, fascinating, grotesque, sacramental, ugly, ritualistic, haphazard, sacred and blasphemous than any fight.”</p> <a hr

<p>Whether you’re into proper winter adventures, such as snorkelling in Iceland, or just a bit of après-ski, our readers’ tips include something for everyone</p><p>Waking up to a pink Arctic sunrise over endless fir trees from my bunk on the overnight train from Stockholm to Abisko was the perfect start to a winter adventure. The <a href="https://www.swedishtouristassociation.com/facilities/stf-abisko-turiststation/">STF Abisko Turiststation</a> served as our base for every snow-related activity that you can imagine: I tried snowshoeing, husky sled driving and cross-country skiing. Equally enjoyable was warming up by one of the many fireplaces and gazing out at the beautiful frozen lake. And, due to the location where a climate phenomenon results in some of the clearest skies in Europe, it was also a wonderful place to watch the northern lights. Scandinavia is famously expensive but staying in the clean, comfortable dorm and cooking in the well-equipped kitchen helped with the costs.

Jazz trumpeter Don Cherry featured the stringed instrument cutting through his full-throated blasts on albums throughout the 1970s and 80s, while producer Marc Minelli blended ngonis with synth melody on his 2001 Electro Bamako project and Malian singer Rokia Traoré used the instrument to bolster electric guitar on her rock-influenced 2013 record Beautiful Africa. Swedish flautist Annarella Sörlin is the latest artist to be inspired by the instrument, on her lyrical debut album with Malian ngoni master Django Diabaté.</p><p>Several of the record’s 11 tracks feature Diabaté playing alongside a full band accompaniment of flute, bass, drums and keys, to mixed effect. On the mid-tempo funk of Megaphone, Diabaté

In truth these creatures are humans in disguise, or at&nbsp;least they embody qualities that are distinctly human; it is purely in their surface – their fur or scales or hair – that they resemble animals. As John&nbsp;Berger <a href="https://www.sas.upenn.edu/~cavitch/pdf-library/Berger_LookAnimals.pdf">wrote</a> back in 1980, they are but “human puppets”, creatures whom we ventriloquise. Like animals in zoos, or large mice inhabited by underpaid and hot theme-park workers, they represent not our proximity, but our estrangement from&nbsp;what Berger calls “the first circle of&nbsp;what surrounded man”, that is animals.

Here’s how one 10-mile section shapes up …</p><p>Two swans and six dusty-grey cygnets mew and whistle as they glide in single file along the canal. Silver birches wiggle their leaves in the gentlest of autumn breezes. Auburn, ochre, russet and shades in between glow in the afternoon sun.

These travails are oddly appropriate: Bridges’ agent Dan Chase is a stubborn old warrior, moving slowly but relentlessly through all obstacles. He’s back in the mountains of Afghanistan – in cahoots with FBI frenemy Harold Harper (John Lithgow) and searching for the woman the pair know as Emily Chase. But are either of them prepared for the whole truth about her? Bridges’ crusty melancholy lends the show a gravitas that takes it slightly beyond the realms of the espionage thriller into something more personal. <em><br>

That isn’t too far from the truth. Moth, born Margaret Wilson in Gisborne, New Zealand in 1951, transformed herself into the woman she wanted to be. She cast off the blond cherubic sweetness of her childhood, adopted an all-black look from the tips of her punky hairdo to her combat boots, named herself after the insect that she most feared, and went to court to fight for her legal right to be sterilised. (“I’m not a breeder,” she said.) She went on to become an intrepid news camerawoman who sought out ever more dangerous assignments, and didn’t run for cover when she got there. On the West Bank, she was shot in the foot by an Israeli soldier. In Sarajevo, a sniper’s bullet destr
