Very few states laws can be considered to be &#8220;famous.&#8221; Almost any state law immediately recognized by people in other states can only be described as &#8220;infamous.&#8221; The Wiretap Law enacted in Massachusetts is definitely infamous. For years, this statute was abused by law enforcement officers and other state employees to punish or prosecute residents [&#8230;]

As we head into next week’s election, it is worth taking a step back and realizing how absolutely ridiculous it is that we spent five or six years with people insisting that Facebook and Twitter absolutely needed to be punished for supposedly engaging in biased content moderation (something they did not do).
