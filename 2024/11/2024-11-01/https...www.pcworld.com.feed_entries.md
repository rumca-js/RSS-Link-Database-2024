<p>Want a Steam Deck-style gaming handheld with a bigger screen and extra features? Check out the Lenovo Legion Go. Not only does it have a super-sized 8.8-inch screen, its handles can pop off a la the Nintendo Switch, and one of them can even be used as a pseudo gaming mouse.</p>

<p>All joking aside, sometimes buying a pre-built computer just makes sense. But what’s the difference between a PC sold by an OEM and one sold by an SI? We asked an expert, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@braethorn">YouTube build master Braethorn</a>, to break it down for us <a href="https://youtu.be/YH_ygvfPsO0">in the latest PCWorld video</a>.</p>



<p>First, let’s define some terms. OEM stands for “original equipment manufacturer,” and in the PC market it refers to companies like Dell, Lenovo, HP, Acer, and others — huge corporations that generally sell hardware all over the world but don’t make everything themselves.</p>

<p>You might not know it, but Nvidia builds a lot of Arm processors. In addition to its self-branded and much-loved SHIELD set-top boxes, it makes the Tegra heart of every Nintendo Switch, now over 140 million of them as its generation winds down.</p>



<p>According to a new report, Nvidia wants to develop a Snapdragon competitor for Windows-based hardware as soon as next year.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20241031PD219.html">DigiTimes Asia</a> reports that Nvidia is designing a combined CPU-GPU system-on-chip specifically for consumer PCs, which would compete head-to-head with Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X series. That would give manufacturers like Dell, Lenovo, Acer, and others a secondary option for Arm-based Windows machines, broadening the market to include four major players: Intel, AMD, Qualcomm, and now Nvidia.</p>

<p>USB flash drives are pretty self-explanatory, aren’t they? All you have to do is plug it into your PC and it’s ready to go, whether you’re using it to transfer files, play media, or launch an app.</p>



<p>But mistakes can happen, and these mistakes can go further than the familiar meme of always needing at least three attempts to finally get that USB connection plugged in. (Less of an issue with USB-C, but I digress.)</p>



<p>Here are the various ways you might be using your USB flash drive incorrectly and the kinds of issues that can crop up.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="youre-using-the-wrong-usb-port">You’re using the wrong USB port</h2>



<p>Many PCs and laptops have multiple USB ports, and many people simply assume that all USB ports are basically equal. When you need to plug in your drive, you might assume it doesn’t matter where it g

<p><a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/windows-11-is-getting-more-popular-climbs-over-355-market-share/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to Neowin</a>, Statcounter’s latest Windows usage figures show that Windows 11’s market share has finally started closing in on Windows 10, but its predecessor still has a huge lead.</p>



<p>The overall share of Windows 10 users now sits at 60.95 percent, which is down 1.8 percentage points from the last survey, while the overall share of Windows 11 users has increased by 2.13 percentage points to 35.55 percent. That means just over twice as many people are still using Microsoft’s older operating system, but the company will probably think the numbers are at least heading in the right direction.</p>

<p>Even some of the most elite gamers haven’t heard of the term “gaming browser.” That’s mostly because there’s only one true gaming browser in the market today: <a href="https://www.bing.com/search?pglt=41&q=opera+gx&cvid=f17b75c870fb4adaa3c104ea90a9fc99&gs_lcrp=EgRlZGdlKgYIABBFGDsyBggAEEUYOzIGCAEQRRg7MgcIAhDpBxhAMgcIAxDpBxhAMgcIBBDpBxhAMgYIBRBFGDsyBwgGEOkHGEAyBwgHEOkHGEAyBggIEEUYPDIICAkQ6QcY_FXSAQgyOTY1ajBqMagCALACAA&FORM=ANNAB1&PC=DCTS">Opera GX</a>. Even so, most browsers can be set up specifically to accentuate your gaming experience.</p>

<p>I’m not saying Windows is a terrible operating system, but it’s definitely no longer the one I choose to use on a day-to-day basis.</p>



<p>After 30+ years of using Windows in its various forms (starting with Windows 95), I have moved on — but not to macOS! In fact, I’ve switched from Windows to ChromeOS and I’m loving every minute of it.</p>



<p>Now, I want to be fully transparent: I admit that I still own an all-in-one Windows PC (currently running Windows 10 because <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394763/windows-11-system-hardware-requirements.html">Microsoft doesn’t think it’s capable of Windows 11</a>), and I’m also likely to buy a new Windows PC before <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2456251/windows-10-will-no-longer-receive-updates-from-october-2025-change-that-with-this-tool.html">support for Windows 10 officially ends</a>.</

<p>Intel’s current mobile processor, Lunar Lake, will be a “one off” design that incorporates memory inside the package, Intel chief executive Pat Gelsinger said during a conference call on Thursday afternoon.</p>



<p>During its third-quarter earnings report, when <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2507906/intel-lost-more-money-than-it-made-last-quarter.html">Intel reported a loss of $16.6 billion</a> that exceeded revenues, Gelsinger was asked about Intel’s Core Ultra Series 2 mobile chip, the first to incorporate DRAM directly into the microprocessor package. Normally, laptop makers buy memory modules from third parties and either insert them inside a DRAM slot or solder them down directly.</p>
