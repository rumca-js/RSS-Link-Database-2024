<p>Google has released <a href="https://github.com/google/differential-privacy/tree/main/pipelinedp4j">PipelineDP4j</a>, a differential privacy solution that allows developers to execute highly parallelizable computations using Java as the baseline language, while providing guarantees that personal information is kept private and secure. </p>



<p>PipelineDP4j opens the door for new applications of differential privacy by reducing the barrier of entry for developers already working in Java, Google said. The software executes on the JVM, can be used with <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3491404/jdk-24-the-new-features-in-java-24.html">Java</a>, <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/

<p>Cloud sustainability is a funny topic. It’s like dental care; everyone agrees it’s important, but who wants to discuss the particulars? It’s much more fun to talk about the new “shiny keys” of IT: AI and its endless possibilities. Cloud sustainability is so five minutes ago. However, like dental care, ignoring the issues will not make them go away.</p>



<p>AI growth was limited this year by the AI chip shortage. With the chip issue resolved, AI will accelerate the sustainability crisis due to its demands on our power grids that will outpace supply. Fortunately, we’re not at that tipping point—yet.</p>

<p>October was an extra busy month in the world of Python, as all signs point to its unstoppable ascent. As reported on InfoWorld, Python is not only the language of choice for AI, but recently beat out JavaScript as the most used language on GitHub. That is no small feat. In more technical news, if you haven’t yet checked out the free-threaded, “no-GIL” build of Python, we encourage it—and we have the guide to get you started. We’ve also updated our introduction to parallelism in Python, which now covers Python threads, subprocesses, the new free-threaded build in Python 3.13, and subinterpreters.</p>
