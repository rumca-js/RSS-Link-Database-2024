Hey all! I have been sick for like 5 weeks, just a stubborn flu but it has affected the uploads a lot. Going forward I will upload videos whenever I have something to show that I think is worthy of your attention, meaning I will not use Wednesdays as upload days. I want to avoid making filler videos for weeks when designing isn't translating to interesting videos. I am travelling to NYC in the upcoming week so uploads might be a bit affected by that as well. But in a few weeks when back in Sweden i am planning frequent uploads and more monster music box progress :) 
Thank you all for watching and for all the warm comments, I am deeply grateful. You all are the best! /Martin
