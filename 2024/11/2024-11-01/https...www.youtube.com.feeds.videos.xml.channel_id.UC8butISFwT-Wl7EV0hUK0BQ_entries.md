On this week's episode of the podcast, freeCodeCamp founder Quincy Larson interviews Adam Stachoviac and Jerod Santo co-hosts of The Changelog – the longest-running software podcast in world. They interview devs about Open Source projects, and they also have a weekly news episode that I always listen to. 5 years ago, I interviewed them for their 10th anniversary episode, and now I'm back catching up on what they've been doing for the past 5 years.

We talk about:
- How open source is changing
- Open data and open LLM models
- Self-reliance and self-hosted infrastructure
- The business of running a developer community

Can you guess what song I'm playing in the intro?
