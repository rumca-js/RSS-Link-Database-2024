								<p>Not all Pokémon TCG cards are created equal - the <strong>most powerful Pokémon cards</strong> of all time are capable of changing the game completely.

								<p><b>Dungeons and Dragons’</b> 2024 DM’s Guide is a streamlined, more organized version of the rulebook that came before. Streamlining, by its nature, means cutting and trimming, and Wizards of the Coast has done <i>plenty</i> of this. We recently went through both versions of the D&amp;D Dungeon Master’s Guide to see what optional rules got the chop.</p>

								<p><strong>Pokémon TCG Pocket</strong> has only just released, and it’s already taking the fandom by storm with its utterly gorgeous cards. The gameplay may be simple, but we can’t deny the fun of opening digital packs and finding a beautiful new Pikachu, Charizard, or Mew. The only problem is, some of these cards are so good that we want to get hold of paper versions of them for our collection - and they just don't exist yet!</p>
