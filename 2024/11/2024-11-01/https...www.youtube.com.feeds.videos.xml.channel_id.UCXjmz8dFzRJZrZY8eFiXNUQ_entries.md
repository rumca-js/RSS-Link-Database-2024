In the 90's, The Farrelly Brothers were the kings of comedy.  Films like Dumb and Dumber, Kingpin, and There's Something About Mary all dominated box offices, and fans everywhere were obsessed.  Though after a few missteps it seems the Farrelly Brothers had lost the magic.  With follow ups to Dumb and Dumber, and attempts at bringing 90's comedy to the 2000's, each new release would do worse than the last.   The Farrelly Brothers would eventually split and focus on their own projects, but like the Coen Brothers are they better together or apart?
