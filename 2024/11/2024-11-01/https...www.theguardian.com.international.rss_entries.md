Technically speaking, for starters, the home team no longer play at a ground called Twickenham and will instead run out at somewhere called Allianz Stadium. The era of the “Ally Pally” has arrived, which may or may not impress the old-school clientele in the posher parts of the West Car Park.</p><p>If there is a sense of the Rugby Football Union selling off the family silver and jettisoning a significant slice of the English game’s global identity it is reinforced by the fact the All Blacks are due to visit a second Allianz Stadium in three weeks’ time when they play Italy in Turin. The only consolation for staunch traditionalists is that fresh monikers can take decades to catch on; some people still refer to the “Manchester Guardian” a me

<p>Cash-strapped racetracks are selling out everyday bettors to whales who use algorithms to wager huge sums at friendlier odds. It’s a rigged system designed for the rich to get richer</p><p>As the thoroughbred horse racing industry fades in America, I think back on the days when it was my life. I think a lot about what became of the thousands of horses I exercised. When I find myself locked in that headspace, the face of one kind little gelding haunts me. Dodgen Bullets, a Bob Baffert trainee, was no star and never going to be much as it was said, but he was willing and like all racehorses painfully innocent. We were young at the seaside in late summer at Del Mar racetrack, where this year’s Breeders’ Cup will be held over the the weekend. I exercised him into his first race, a Maiden Special Weight for two-year-olds which he won decisively. His connections pocketed over $50,000 in purse money and, aside from the $12 a day I made exercising him, I collected nearly $500 betting on h

<p>Born into a line of pirates and possible spies, the guitarist went from Castro-era Cuba to art-pop’s greatest group. As his solo work is reissued, he explains why he was too adventurous for his old band</p><p>In the booklet that accompanies Phil Manzanera’s career-spanning, 11-CD box set, 50 Years of Music, there is a photocopied page of small ads from a 1971 edition of Melody Maker. In between the news that chart-topping comedy trio the Scaffold need a “sensitive musician” for a university tour, and an unnamed German rock drummer “seeks a good heavy group (no time-wasters)”, lurks an appeal from an “avant-rock group” in search of a guitarist. It says nothing about their sound or their influences, but offers an intriguing set of adjectives: the successful applicant will be “fast, slow, elegant, witty, scary, stable, tricky”.</p><p>As Manzanera explains, had he not been sufficiently intrigued to apply, “we wouldn’t be sitting here today” – on a video call, with him in his London st

It has been more than a year since Swedish workers came out on strike against his electric car giant Tesla. Swedish industrial union IF Metall has been demanding better wages, benefits and conditions for mechanics in Tesla repair shops across the country, but fundamentally what is at stake is the Swedish labour market model of collective bargaining which Musk refuses to recognise.</p><p>It is the <a href="https://www.industriall-union.org/swedish-union-warns-of-strike-at-tesla">first and only strike</a> against Tesla anywhere in the world.

<p>A chance for Manchester United’s players to impress, an audition for Iraola and a pivotal clash at Portman Road</p><p>Dilemmas, dilemmas. Eddie Howe has a few in advance of Arsenal’s visit to Tyneside on Saturday as Newcastle aim to correct a run of five Premier League games without a win. Wednesday night’s restorative Carabao Cup victory against Chelsea has surely created competition for places, particularly at right-back where Emil Krafth’s strong performance suggests he should arguably start in front of Tino Livramento. Significantly, with Bruno Guimarães benched for most of the evening, Sandro Tonali shone right at the heart of midfield. Is now the moment to leave the Italy international in the centre of things and relocate Guimarães to Tonali’s right or even start the Brazil midfielder on the bench again? Similarly Joe Willock, once of Arsenal, impressed on the left side of that department, pressing well and carrying the ball considerable distances across the pitch. Can Newca
