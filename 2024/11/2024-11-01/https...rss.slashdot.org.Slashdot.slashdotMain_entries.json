Most researchers suspect these bizarre structures are the result of tidal forces and heating within the moon. Caleb Strom, a graduate student at the University of North Dakota who worked with Nordheim and Alex Patthoff of the Planetary Science Institute in Arizona, revisited the Voyager 2 images.

Projects to fix buildings containing hazardous and radioactive material at the state-owned site on the Cumbrian coast are running years late and over budget. Sellafield's spending is so vast -- with costs of more than 2.7 billion pounds a year -- that it is causing tension with the Treasury, the report from the National Audit Office (NAO) suggests. Officials from finance ministry told the NAO it was \"not always clear\" how Sellafield made decisions, the report reveals. Criticisms of its costs and processes come as the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, prepares to plug a hole of about 40 billion pounds in her maiden budget.

The nonprofit's CEO, Marian Goodell, primarily blamed flagging higher-priced ticket sales and increased operating costs since the pandemic. \n\nThe festival has sold a tier of higher-priced tickets since at least 2016. In 2023, a limited number of more expensive advance tickets were available between Feb. 1 and Feb. 3, with 1,000 tickets costing $2,750 each and 3,000 costing $1,500, according to an archived version of Burning Man's 2023 ticket page. Ticket sales for the annual bacchanal in Black Rock City flopped this year after a rain-plagued 2022, and scores of burners later resold their tickets, eating huge losses.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Burning+Man+Is+Desperate+For+Cash%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fnews.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F10%2F31%2F2026236%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitt", "id": 1425973, "language": null, "link": "https://news.slashdot.org/story/24/10/31/2026236/burning-man-is-desperate-for-cash?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 306, "source_url": "https://rss.slashdot.org/Slashdot/slashdotMain", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Burning Man Is Desperate For Cash", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-11-01T00:57:58.406050+00:00", "description": "Former Google chief Eric Schmidt thinks the US Army should expunge \"useless\" tanks and replace them with AI-powered drones instead.
