I am a network engineer, and I constantly find myself using canyouseemee.org or yougetsignal.com to test if a specific port is reachable from the internet - either to test if a service is properly configured, or if a port-forwarding is l working. </p> <p>I&#39;m looking for a self-hosted alternative to this service. Something I could run on my VPS, and then, query it, from any machine in the world to see if the VPS reaches it. </p> <p>Ideally, I would love if this worked over cli too, using curl. So, the idea is that on any machine I&#39;m configuring, I could simply run <code>curl canyouseeme.mydomain.com/443</code> and it would reply with a yes or no, whether it can reach that IP on port 443.</p> <p>Obs: the curl idea came after I started using &#39;curl ipinfo.io/ip&#39; to quickly find my public IP and fell in love with the simplicity of it. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/YankeeLimaVict", "id": 1430295, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1ghazx9/looking_for_a_selfhosted_alternative_to", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 450, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Looking for a self-hosted alternative to canyouseeme.org", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-11-01T17:14:46+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I have finally managed to set up Traefik but have been unable to set it to see docker hosts on two different machines.</p> <p>I have used the providers section in the traefik.yml file to ser the local docker host but have been unable to add the second machine that runs a docker proxy container.</p> <p>has anyone got a working example they could share?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Embarrassed_Lab28\"> /u/Embarrassed_Lab28 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1ghalhn/help_using_traefik_for_multiple_docker_hosts/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1ghalhn/help_using_traefik_for_multiple_docker_hosts/\">[comments]</a></span>", "id": 1430298, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1ghalhn/help_using_traefik_for_multiple_docker_hosts", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 450, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "HELP: Using Traefik for multiple docker hosts", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-11-01T16:55:07+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hello</p> <p>I have a pi4 setup with some docker containers</p> <p>I want the pi to reboot once a day, this is because after a while of it running, the whole system seems to fail and some important containers stop functioning</p> <p>I wanted to know the best way to do this reboot to make sure the containers are not harmed</p> <p>I was going to add</p> <pre><code>0 0 * * * root reboot </code></pre> <p>to my crontab, but wasnt sure if this was safe</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/HopeDoesStufff\"> /u/HopeDoesStufff </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1gha4vv/auto_reboot_pi_4_questions/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1gha4vv/auto_reboot_pi_4_questions/\">[comments]</a></span>", "id": 1429754, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1gha4vv/auto_reboot_pi_4_questions", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 450, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Auto Reboot Pi 4 - Questions", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-11-01T16:50:38+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hello everyone!
