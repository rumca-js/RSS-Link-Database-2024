<p>If you’re wondering what happened to Amazon’s new and improved version of its Alexa voice assistant, you’re not alone. <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2024-10-30/new-amazon-alexa-ai-is-stuck-in-the-lab-till-it-can-outsmart-chatgpt?sref=10lNAhZ9&amp;embedded-checkout=true"><em><ins>Bloomberg</ins></em></a> reports that the new Alexa is still stuck in its developmental phase and Amazon has cut off access to its beta phase including its new “Let’s Chat” phase. As a result, a planned late 2024 launch has been pushed back to next year.</p>
<p>The problem seems to be with its large language models (LLMs).

<p>One of fantasy and sci-fi’s all-time greats has <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://x.com/HildebrandtGreg/status/1852427920834474141" data-original-link="https://x.com/HildebrandtGreg/status/1852427920834474141">passed away</a>. Artist Greg Hildebrandt, known for his iconic work on Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, Marvel and <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>, died on Thursday at 85. He and his twin brother Tim, who died in 2006, were a powerhouse duo — the Brothers Hildebrandt — until they decided to pursue solo careers in 1981.</p>
<p>The duo was perhaps best known for their “Style B” poster (above) for the original <em>Star Wars</em> in 1977. Released in the UK (Tom Jung’s “Style A” was the original US poster), the art shows Luke Skywalker heroically hoisting his lightsaber high above his head like King Arthur wielded Excalibur. He’s flanked by a blaster-toting Princess Leia, with C-3PO and R2-D2 looking on from behin

<p>A new update for Instagram posted earlier today could fix one of the most frustrating problems for creators. <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DB1GSFPSGRs/">Adam Mosseri</a>, the head of Instagram, announced a new filtering update on Instagram for creators’ inboxes.</p>
<p>Instagram users with a creator-designated account can now filter message requests in their inbox based on its sender in a similar way to Gmail’s labels. Creators can still sort their messages by the most “recent” received and by the “number of followers&quot; but they can now filter out certain messages. The new filters include requests and messages from “verified accounts,” “businesses,” “creators” and “subscribers.”</p>

## How we test VPNs

<p>VPNs, or virtual private networks, are everywhere. If you’ve spent any time at all on YouTube, chances are you’ve seen an ad selling VPNs — <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-influencer-selling-vpns-security-problems-153046206.html">there have been literally hundreds and thousands of them</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We test and review VPNs so you don&#39;t have to — but what even is a VPN? The pitch is fairly simple: a VPN can mask your IP address and the identity of your device by routing your traffic through a remote server. Sites and services will see a different IP address to your own, and your internet service provider will only be able to see that you’re connected to a VPN server, rather than what sites you’re visiting. That means a VPN can be an important tool to keep your data private and secure, especially if you need to connect to an unsecured network. If you’re on public WiFi, for example, you can’t be sure what they’re tracking while you’re surfin

<p><em>The US presidential election is in its final stretch. Before election day on November 5, Engadget is looking at where the candidates, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, stand on the most consequential tech issues of our day.</em></p>
<p>Broadband access in poorer and more rural communities has been a major campaign issue since 2008. Bridging the digital divide was a key component of <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-01-21-obamas-legacy-the-most-tech-savvy-president.html">Barack Obama’s</a> platform. And, while far from perfect, his administration did a lot of work to grow the nation’s fiber-optic infrastructure, free up wireless spectrum and expand access to subsidies for low-income families. While successive administrations have promised to continue the work of bringing high-speed internet to the most underserved communities, the results have been disappointing. Both Kamala Harris and Donald Trump have pledged to get Americans online, but political

<p>If you’re excited, or even just a little curious, about the future of augmented reality, Meta’s Orion prototype makes the most compelling case yet for the technology.</p>
<p>For Meta, Orion is about more than finally making AR glasses a reality. It’s also the company’s best shot at becoming less dependent on Apple and Google’s app stores, and the rules that come with them. If Orion succeeds, then maybe we won’t need smartphones for much at all. Glasses, Zuckerberg <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/24253481/meta-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-ar-glasses-orion-ray-bans-ai-decoder-interview" data-original-link="https://www.theverge.com/24253481/meta-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-ar-glasses-orion-ray-bans-ai-decoder-interview"><ins>has speculated</ins></a>, might eventually become “the main way we do computing.”</p>

## The best white elephant gift ideas to exchange in 2024

<p>Whether or not you’ve heard of a white elephant gift exchange before, there’s a good chance you have the wrong idea of what it is, how it actually works and where the idea came from. According to legend, the King of Siam would give a white elephant to courtiers who had upset them. It was a far more devious punishment than simply having them executed. The recipient had no choice but to simply thank the king for such an opulent gift, knowing that they likely could not afford the upkeep for such an animal. It would inevitably lead them to financial ruin.<br><br>This story is almost certainly untrue, but it has led to a modern holiday staple: the white elephant gift exchange. Picking the right white elephant gift means walking a fine line: the goal isn’t to just buy something terrible and force someone to take it home with them. Rather, it should be just useful or amusing enough that it won’t immediately get tossed into the trash. The recipient also shouldn’t be able to just throw it
