No More Room in Hell 2 reviewed in Early |Access by Carli Velocci on PC.

No More Room in Hell 2 has a lot of potential. It plays around with clever ideas about how to get players to work together through some excellent level design, but those concepts aren’t explored enough yet to make it more than just another co-op survival horror shooter with generic guns and scarce loot. This Early Access launch at least allows you to team up with friends for a few fun rounds, but with a single map that gets repetitive fast and a mountain of serious bugs that cause unexpected problems, it needs a lot more time in the oven. With a slew of hotfixes already arriving and more supposedly on the way, hopefully the flames of hell are hot enough to cook it to perfection down the line, but you should probably wait until they do.

## PS5 vs Xbox: Who Has the Best Fall 2024 Lineup? - Next-Gen Console Watch

Welcome back to Next-Gen Console Watch. This week Daemon is joined by Unlocked's Ryan McCaffrey and Beyond's Max Scoville to compare the PS5 and Xbox's lineup for the rest of the year. Sony is launching its mid-gen refresh in the PS5 Pro, but doesn't really have a major exclusive this Fall that shows off that extra horsepower. Meanwhile, the Xbox Series X and S consoles are being outsold by Sony, but the lineup of new exclusive games for the rest of the year seems more robust on their side. Sony does have an obvious Game of the Year contender in the recent Astro Bot, and the Horizon Zero Dawn remaster is just around the corner (despite no one really asking for it). And in Microsoft's camp, they have heavy first-party hitters like Indiana Jones and the Great Circle (a timed exclusive), and Microsoft Flight Simular 2024, not to mention the highly-anticipated S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl.

## Black Ops 6’s Coolest Mission Shows It’s Time Call of Duty Left Modern Warfare Behind

Call of Duty Black Ops 6’s coolest mission shows it’s time Call of Duty left Modern Warfare behind. Every one of the BO6 missions points to an interesting future for Call of Duty single-player, be that its opportunity-based intelligence gathering gala that copies Hitman’s homework, the (MGS5) Metal Gear Solid 5-like open world level dotted with mini objectives, or the perspective-hopping casino heist that’s painted in shades of GTA 5. But if CoD is to pin its single-player destiny on any one of BLOPS 6’s ideas, I’d like to make the case for its most left-field choice: its delightfully messed-up homage to Resident Evil.
