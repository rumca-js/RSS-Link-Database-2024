Horizon Zero Dawn was originally released as a PS4 exclusive back in 2017. While the years since then have been quite kind to the game, its protagonist, and especially the world, ultimately leading to a critically acclaimed sequel, PlayStation wanted to give the original a second shot by giving it a fresh coat of paint in its remastered release. 

The decision seems to have paid off quite well. Thanks to the downright gorgeous visuals, Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered feels like the definitive way to play the game, with jaw-dropping vistas. It is worth noting, however, that it is still the same game as the original 2017 release, which means that it still has the same strengths and weaknesses. 

While it's got a great story, and hunting down giant robot dinosaurs is certainly a good time, the melee combat system is still shallow, and the story still has poor pacing, especially in its first act.

The Mario and Luigi series returns after a 9-year absence, and it genuinely looks like a return to form. Despite the closure of AlphaDream studios, Mario and Luigi Brothership glistens with a degree of polish and potential just begging to be explored. 

The game tasks the brothers with connecting the drifting islands of Concordia using a ship and some helpful allies. The ship in question acts as the hub of the game, granting fast-travel to previously connected islands and a commune for the various citizenry to set up shops and hand out quests.

Mario and Luigi Brothership looks to be a pretty sizable adventure with a lot of variety, considering all the distinct islands, and we canâ€™t wait to connect them together when it sets sail on November 7th .

If it wasn't apparent in all the previews thus far, Dragon Age: The Veilguard is a sizable experience. The environments offer a deceptively surprising amount of content to experience, from side quests and puzzles to treasures. Some areas can't even be accessed without the right companion, encouraging revisits.

Then there are all the nuances, from the various factions whose reputations you can raise to the Caretaker's Workshop, which affects the level of loot earned and the available Enchantments. On top of that is combat - whichever class you've chosen remains permanent for a playthrough, and companions have their own skills to manage.

There's a lot to unpack, but once you figure it all out, they can provide numerous benefits to help your journey. Here are 15 tips and tricks that you should know about Dragon Age: The Veilguard, which is out now on Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC.
