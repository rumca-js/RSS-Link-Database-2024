Turbo cancers are rapidly forming, spreading and mutating. 

UK surgeon, Dr James Royle

Confirming Prof. Angus Dalgleish

‘Many of my multidisciplinary team colleagues, fellow surgeons, oncologists, pathologists, radiologists and specialist nurses all acknowledged to me sudden change in patterns,

and dramatic increase in these incurable advanced cancers that we’ve observed in these past two years.’ 

The close temporal association between the increase cancers and the rollout fulfils the gold standard Bradford-Hill epidemiological criteria for causation.
