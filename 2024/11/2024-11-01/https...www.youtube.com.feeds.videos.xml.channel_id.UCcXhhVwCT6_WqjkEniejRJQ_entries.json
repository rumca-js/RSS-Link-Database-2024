I have been sick for like 5 weeks, just a stubborn flu but it has affected the uploads a lot. Going forward I will upload videos whenever I have something to show that I think is worthy of your attention, meaning I will not use Wednesdays as upload days. I want to avoid making filler videos for weeks when designing isn't translating to interesting videos. I am travelling to NYC in the upcoming week so uploads might be a bit affected by that as well. But in a few weeks when back in Sweden i am planning frequent uploads and more monster music box progress :) \nThank you all for watching and for all the warm comments, I am deeply grateful. You all are the best! /Martin\n\nSupport Wintergatan:\n- Patreon \u25ba https://patreon.com/Wintergatan\n- Youtube membership \u25ba https://bit.ly/4cQVM7C\n\nMarble Machine Engineering Discord Server:\nhttps://discord.com/invite/7aSFJA6bkH\n\nVideo edited By Martin and Hannes from the Trainerds YouTube Channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/TRAINERDS\n\n\u2014\nPATREON \u25ba h", "id": 1429212, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vg6sG3frJ18", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 393, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCcXhhVwCT6_WqjkEniejRJQ", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/Vg6sG3frJ18/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "The MONSTER Music Box Returns - Marble Machine X got it right...", "vote": 0}]
