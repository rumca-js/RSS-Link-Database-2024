The Babylon Bee is Garbage For Trump in this election betting odds special with guest Maxim Lott of ElectionBettingOdds.Com, who tells us Trump is absolutely 100% going to win every time 60% of the time. President Biden called Trump supporters garbage, Whoopi Goldberg went on an insane rant, and Kamala seems to be chickening out with Joe Rogan. That’s not all!
