Today on the Matt Walsh Show, as we gear up for the election, today we'll review some of the Biden-Harris Administration's most outlandish DEI policies. They wasted a lot of money and time on this nonsense. We'll go through the list. Also, the media is fitting one more Trump hoax in before the election. They're claiming that Trump threatened to kill Liz Cheney. Is that true? Obviously not. Also, a trans-identified male was denied a job at Hooters. He claims his human rights were violated. The state of New York seems to agree.
