He said the game never went everywhere and that he had 7 copies. He had about 4 left, so 2 should be floating around. </p> <p>Anyways, here\u2019s the game. I really dig the artwork but the game itself isn\u2019t very balanced at all, unfortunately. It\u2019s very easy to die of hunger if you roll poorly.

Im not fully sure if we played it right but the instructions didnt gave a clear awnser. If the Warrior wants to use a witch potion to double the number of one dice, he has to decide instant after the dice roll. I think, to do so, he has to \u201eslow roll\u201c his 4 blue hero dice. Then he can decide after each specific dice, if he wants to double it. My gf argued only the ranger has to roll dice individual, and the warrior should roll all 4 dice and then decide, knowing the amount of each one. Therefor he gainsmuch more information, knowing all his results and obviosly choosing the highest to double.

So, what is your expierence in this? I&#39;m ok if it&#39;s hard to achieve, but is it really rewarding? Could you win the game without even touching this hacking part?

I&#39;m a huge Dune fan and i actually just found out dune imperium is even a thing for some reason just a few months ago.</p> <p>So I know i would love Dune Imperium. Its right up my alley from what ive watched of it. </p> <p>However, my dad is the only person i ever play board games with and he has a bit of a harder time with games like scythe or starwars rebellion or even a game like wingspan. And its the fact that he some times has a hard time with the rules of wingspan that kind of prevents me from wanting to get dune imperium and get something else instead ", "id": 1444072, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1gijnwa/for_those_who_have_played_dune_imperium", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 473, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "For those who have played Dune Imperium", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-11-03T09:51:13+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>my wife and I are playing to ticket to ride legends of the west, we reached the 4th round wchich is year 1874, the game instructed us to add the first frontier board (to expand the main board map), we chose &quot;open range&quot;, them we realized the tracks going to different citites are empty, the game provides you with track sticker (7 of each color) and it is up to us to paste the sticker, meaning we decide which route will be of what color.</p> <p>I am afraid to do this because one could argue that if we placed the stickers in a unbalanced way, we could potentially break the game. how do I decide whether the longest route shoulb be black (favoring me the black player) or blue, or yellow?

The biggest flaw is that huge extensive character development tree is not really necessary in practice, since skill dices are not very effective: their effects are mostly mediocre, you do not know which ability will you roll, which complicates planning, and you can use them only once per battle. It is much more effective to simply upgrade your basic stats.</p> <p>Sure, you can sacrifice efficiency for the sake of variety and fan, but then chances of losing increase very significantly...</p> <p>Also there is not much room for tactics here - the board is too small for that. Basically, long-range gearlocks usually just stand still and shoot, while melee ghirlocks come up and hit. Decision what to use, as mentioned above, is pretty obvious.
