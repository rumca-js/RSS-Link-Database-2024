Why is developing a CRUD in Django so popular? I&#39;ve worked on projects using Django, and I know it&#39;s a powerful framework that&#39;s easy to work with, but I&#39;ve mostly used it for building websites. I don\u2019t quite understand why it\u2019s so useful specifically for creating CRUD applications.</p> <p>For example, while browsing, I&#39;ve found many tutorials and courses on building CRUDs in Django with the Django Rest Framework.

I&#39;m curious if there\u2019s ever been a poll or discussion on this subreddit about how people use Django. Specifically, I\u2019d love to know how many of you primarily use Django just for building APIs (e.g., with DRF) versus how many are building full SSR applications with Django only, using tools like DTL, Alpine.js, htmx, etc.</p> <p>I\u2019m interested in seeing the breakdown in our community between those who go API-only and those who leverage Django as a complete SSR framework. Any insights or links to past discussions would be greatly appreciated.
