Throw in cadvisor and node exporter to keep an eye on health of everything running.</p> <p>All of those would allow me to simply plug the Pi into the router and not have to worry about messing with the router&#39;s settings to make everything work.

I’d like to switch this server to Proxmox and add it to my cluster.</p> <p>My knee-jerk reaction is to virtualize Unraid. This way I would maintain its storage flexibility, but be able to use the rest of the hardware for other VMs, not just plex and arrs.

Virtualize TrueNAS Scale with its recent vdev expansion feature? Just a basic proxmox storage pool for my VMs to use? Virtualize Unraid? Thanks in a

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sure this question has been asked before, so apologies for that. I currently use proxmox and am looking to create a container or VM to handle a remote generative model to hopefully replace my need for OpenAI&#39;s API. Any ideas or starting places to look? I think LLAMA is an option?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Antoniopapp"> /u/Antoniopapp </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1gibaoy/looking_for_completely_opensource_and/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1gibaoy/looking_for_completely_opensource_and/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi I&#39;ve installed <a href="https://github.com/automatisch/automatisch">Automatish</a> on docker. It&#39;s accessible on my-vps-ip:3000 and I can log in without any issue. I&#39;m trying to set up reverse proxy for that as a subdomain of my domain (on Cloudflare) with Nginx Proxy Manager. When I access the subdomain, I got the following json response in the browser instead of the web UI.</p> <p><code>// 20241102184104</code><br/> <code>//</code> <a href="https://subdomain.domain.com/"><code>https://subdomain.domain.com/</code></a></p> <p><code>{</code><br/> <code>&quot;status&quot;: &quot;OK&quot;,</code><br/> <code>&quot;version&quot;: {</code><br/> <code>&quot;major&quot;: 2,</code><br/> <code>&quot;minor&quot;: 12,</code><br/> <code>&quot;revision&quot;: 1</code><br/> <code>}</code><br/> <code>}</code></p> <p>If someone could point out what I&#39;m missing, I&#39;d really appreciate it.
