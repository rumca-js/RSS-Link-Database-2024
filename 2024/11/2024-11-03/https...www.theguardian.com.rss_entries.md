<p>The national treasure is back with a witty, warm televisual wonder, this time exploring the most populous and stunningly biodiverse continent. But where is the urgency about the climate crisis?</p><p>The clocks change, the nights draw in, and along comes David Attenborough to ease those autumnal blues. Right on cue, he is here, narrating another magnificent series about weird and wonderful nature that allows him to say delicious, fantastical phrases such as “a special set of grasping belly fins”. The continent of Asia covers almost a third of the planet’s land area, and encompasses desert, forest, mountains and frozen wilderness. It is also the most populous continent, forcing humans and animals to coexist “in the most remarkable ways”. In short, it’s a place full of the kind of stories on which nature documentaries thrive, covering all sorts of terrain and ecosystems, and this first episode is an excuse to explore a massive swathe of water, with its 21 oceans and seas.</p><p>As e

<p>It has come to feel like a collector’s item – a Manchester United goal in the Premier League. And so when it came, Bruno Fernandes converting from the penalty spot on 70 minutes, the celebrations were suitably wild.

It was a release of emotion because there had been so many frustrations in terms of the United performance. It was only the team’s ninth goal of the league season – in their tenth game. Remarkable levels of profligacy has been one of the themes of their season; one of the many drivers in the demise of Erik ten Hag.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/03/manchester-united-chelsea-p

<p>Behold the new steely, ever-so-slightly more pragmatic version of Angeball. From opting for the powerful runs of Pape Matar Sarr in midfield, to finding the right motivational words when all seemed lost at half-time, this was a good day for Tottenham’s romanticist of a manager. Ange Postecoglou’s tactical choices were right, his substitutions worked and the margin of victory was no more than Spurs deserved after they made light of their latest set-piece wobble and overwhelmed Aston Villa with a stirring second-half display.</p><p>It had looked ominous when Villa, who missed the chance to go third, smuggled a lead through Morgan Rogers. By the end, though, Spurs were running riot, James Maddison coming off the bench to add the fourth in added time. Brennan Johnson had scored the equaliser and a touch of class from Dejan Kulusevski had sent Dominic Solanke through to score the first of two quickfire goals. Unai Emery, who had succeeded in squeezing the life out of Spurs in the first

A cause for celebration, yes, but there was sadness in the air tonight too, as the British pianist has decided to hang up her hat as a performing musician. This handsomely curated programme was by way of her final hurrah.</p><p>At the heart of the matter were two of the great cello sonatas: Shostakovich’s neurasthenic outpouring from 1934 and Franck’s fully sanctioned arrangement of his hyper-romantic A major violin sonata from 1888.

<p>From his breakthrough roles to his life-changing accident, this rounded film portrays the courage and resilience of the late film star</p><p>“I played the part, I’m not that man,” says the late-70s-era Christopher Reeve, promoting his breakthrough role as a costumed comic-book superhero, years before the devastating horse-riding accident that would leave him paralysed and hooked to a ventilator. The actor’s biography is invariably framed as a tale of two halves. Triumph and disaster. The charmed and the cursed. But Ian Bonhote and Peter Ettedgui’s polished, respectful documentary – made with the support of Reeve’s surviving family – does well in linking both sides, painting the whole person and showing how his essential good character was revealed and sharpened by the crisis that befell him. On screen, the man play-acted the qualities of courage and resilience. Off it, he came to embody them too.</p><p>In UK and Irish cinemas</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/nov/

<p>Fashion, culture, art, history – and diamonds – all come together in Antwerp. Here’s how to do it</p><p>Brussels and Bruges get all the attention, but Antwerp is Belgium’s most dynamic city. Shaped by its Flemish heritage, working port and centuries-old diamond trade, it’s a destination that feels both historic and excitingly modern offering a great mix of art – from Rubens masterpieces to avant-garde galleries – cutting-edge fashion and a buzzy food scene.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2024/nov/03/antwerp-belgium-10-best-things-to-do">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Making delicious chocolate is one thing, doing it in a war zone is worthy of a medal</p><p>A few weeks ago Felicity Spector, senior producer of <em>Channel 4 News,</em> contacted me. She’d just returned from another trip to Ukraine, could she send me some amazing chocolate she’d found there? This made me quite emotional for many reasons.</p><p>My answer was: of course. And a few days later a package arrived with some bean-to-bar <strong>Meetty</strong> chocolate that had come, via the C4 news desk in London, to me in Suffolk from Ukraine. What I was sent was the gift box, £25 plus shipping, that has won an <a href="https://academyofchocolate.org.uk/">Academy of Chocolate </a>silver award. In this beautifully simple box there are 12 mini-bars of chocolate, each colourfully illustrated with examples of Ukrainian art and each weighing 24g, which is a perfect one-person portion and don’t let anyone tell you different.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/03/notes-on

But at the end of this <a href="https://modernartoxford.org.uk/whats-on/belkis-ayon-sikan-illuminations">startling exhibition</a>, which presents more than 40 works, there is a sense of something more personal stirring in her art’s singularly strange and intricate mythology.</p><p>Born and raised in Havana, the daughter of a former fighter in the Angolan civil war

<p>The Office for Budget Responsibility’s extreme conservatism means it has woefully underestimated the impact of Labour’s public spending plans</p><p>There is a consensus among economists that a precondition for higher growth is higher levels of investment, and that one of the most certain ways of lifting investment levels is for the state to&nbsp;provide a lead.</p><p>Whether European growth in the 1950s, Japan’s astounding national income-doubling plan in the 1960s or the dynamic growth of the Asian tigers in the 1970s and 80s, it has been the same story of higher public investment triggering a step change in economic growth. In the US, vast increases in investment spending on defence have induced growth and the tech revolution, given extra economic impetus by President Joe Biden’s infrastructure and R&amp;D spending.

If you were worried about me after that, and I understand you might have been, you can now relax. For here I am at Mauby, a new Caribbean restaurant in Brockley, southeast London, and the first plate before us is a single, fat smoked sausage with exactly the right crisp-skinned snap and the correct smooth, juicy interior that I had hoped for.
