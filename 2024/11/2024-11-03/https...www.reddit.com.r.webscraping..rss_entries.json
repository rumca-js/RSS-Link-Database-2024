For a while, it was possible to directly make requests to this in python and use the returned JSON. However, now this returns a 401 error.</p> <p>I tried using chromedriver to open the homepage initially, take the authenticated session cookie, and pass this to the next requests to the API and that worked for a day or so, but now it doesn\u2019t and I can\u2019t find a way around it.</p> <p>For context, the internal API call can\u2019t be opened in your browser anymore (you could before), and even populating my headers directly from a real browsing session that is open and working in real time doesn\u2019t seem to work now.</p> <p>Any ideas on what has been changed, and potential solutions?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/SJRussell23\"> /u/SJRussell23 </a> <br/> <span><a", "id": 1444018, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1gijgkj/401_on_internal_api", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 467, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "401 on internal API", "vote": 0}]
