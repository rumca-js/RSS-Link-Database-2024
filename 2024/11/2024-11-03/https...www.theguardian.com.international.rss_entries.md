<ul><li>Lamar Jackson perfect as Ravens beat Broncos</li><li>Dallas slump to third defeat as Falcons soar</li></ul><p>Tyler Bass kicked a career-best 61-yard field goal with five seconds left, Josh Allen threw three second-half touchdown passes in a back-and-forth duel with Miami’s Tua Tagovailoa, and the Buffalo Bills (7-2) continued their domination of the Dolphins (2-6) with a 30-27 victory. The teams traded leads four times in a thrilling second half that included seven consecutive scoring drives – four by AFC East-leading Buffalo and three by division rival Miami. Buffalo’s final drive stalled at the Miami 43 following a spike and two incompletions, and coach Sean McDermott put his faith in the inconsistent Bass. He came through with the longest field goal in franchise history.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/nov/03/nfl-roundup-sunday-football-scores">Continue reading...</a>

<p>It turns out long-held resentments exist even in the animal kingdom. Does that mean they hold an evolutionary advantage?</p><p>The best thing that happened to me during the whole of the pandemic was a story on the internet. An Oregon resident, furloughed, saw on a daytime nature documentary that, if you fed crows, they would bring you <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/ki6fnd/oregon_i_accidentally_created_an_army_of_crow/">small gifts</a>. Curious, they tried it, and were delighted to find themselves in effective possession of a 15-strong crow family – but then things took a dark turn. The crows became an army, fiercely protective of their leader’s property. If neighbours came near, the crows would dive-bomb them. “To be clear,” the person wrote on Reddit, “they’re not aggressive 100% of the time. If just the neighbours are out [on their own porch], they are friendly, normal crows. They only get aggressive when someone gets close to me or my property.”</p><p>It

<p>Torn between childcare, caring for grandchildren and also looking after elderly parents brings all kinds of sibling tensions to the surface, so rather than opting for couples therapy, it could be time to get some sibling therapy </p><p>Caring for other people is a horrible, painful privilege. Yes it gives meaning to life, yes it perhaps is what we exist on earth to do, etc, but also, it can be messy, upsetting and dull, often all at the same time, and often at night. There is nobody who knows this better, nobody who knows it with their every cell, their every tooth, than a middle-aged woman who is responsible for the care, not just of their young children, but also their old parents. A 2022 poll estimated that 6 million Britons consider themselves to be in this “sandwich generation”, with increased longevity (a recent study confirmed that people born in the 1940s and 1950s are living longer than their parents) leading to a further descriptor. People in their 40s-60s who care for t

<p>Mikey Madison is outstanding as an exotic dancer who marries an oligarch’s son in Baker’s fiery and profane Palme d’Or-winning comedy drama</p><p>Her name is Anora but everyone calls her Ani. She’s fluent in Russian but prefers to speak English. She dances at a strip club, which means she’s emphatically not a sex worker, even if she occasionally moonlights as one on the side. Ani, it’s clear, is smarter and tougher than she lets on to her clients. But the woman’s a mess; she’s compromised and conflicted. Probably the world around her is too.</p><p><em>Anora</em>, the brilliant new picture from American writer-director <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/oct/21/sean-baker-interview-anora-lapdance-film-palme-dor">Sean Baker</a>, is a screwball Cinderella tale – frenetic and funny, fiery and profane.

<p>In this sharp and engaging book, Shabi addresses the need to understand and confront antisemitism at a time when it is being downplayed by parts of the left and exploited by others on the right</p><p>When I started to read Rachel Shabi’s new book, I felt a profound sense of relief and recognition. As she writes: “The left has ceded the space on antisemitism… and the right has smartly and strategically filled that void.” As someone who has been involved for years with various causes where leftwing people gather, I wholeheartedly concur. It’s more than time to take back that space. The downplaying of antisemitism by the left has led to some racism being given a free pass, and it has also resulted in a depressing lack of empathy around the Jewish experience and a weakening of potential solidarity.</p><p>It has been hard to talk about this for a long time, for fear of detracting from what feels like more pressing anti-black racism. But now, when charges of antisemitism are being used

<p>John and Funmilayo Abe’s famed Abi Morocco photographic studio captured generations of Nigerians on camera</p><p>This picture was taken at a famous photographic studio in Lagos in 1979. The studio, Abi Morocco, was run by a husband-and-wife team, John and Funmilayo Abe, from the 1970s to 2006, and captured images of generations of Nigerians during decades in which the exponentially growing city became the unofficial street-style capital of Africa and the world. The picture is included in a new exhibition that traces the place of the staged portrait in that story – in the years before smartphones and Instagram rendered many high street studios obsolete.</p><p>The exhibition is derived from an evolving project called <a href="https://www.karlohiri.com/lagos-studio-archives">Lagos Studio Archives</a> that is the work of two artists and curators, Karl Ohiri and Riikka Kassinnen, which now involves the preservation of thousands of film negatives from that period.
