Shower drain installation tips…I maximize the plywood hole to 5 inches for KERDI-DRAINs. Then I dry fit the drain along with the shower pan  spacer to get the riser pipe height. Chamfering PVC promotes good solvent welding and reduces potential water leaks. It’s important to make the drain level and I also cap it with the 4-inch Gripper plug. Many thanks to Schluter for providing this drain for my client’s custom shower build 👍🏽🔥#plumbing #schluter #brandpartner #bathroomremodel
