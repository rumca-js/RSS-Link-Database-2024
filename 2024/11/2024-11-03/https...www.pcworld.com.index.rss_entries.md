<p>I’m not saying Windows is a terrible operating system, but it’s definitely no longer the one I choose to use on a day-to-day basis.</p>



<p>After 30+ years of using Windows in its various forms (starting with Windows 95), I have moved on — but not to macOS! In fact, I’ve switched from Windows to ChromeOS and I’m loving every minute of it.</p>



<p>Now, I want to be fully transparent: I admit that I still own an all-in-one Windows PC (currently running Windows 10 because <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394763/windows-11-system-hardware-requirements.html">Microsoft doesn’t think it’s capable of Windows 11</a>), and I’m also likely to buy a new Windows PC before <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2456251/windows-10-will-no-longer-receive-updates-from-october-2025-change-that-with-this-tool.html">support for Windows 10 officially ends</a>.</
