Had an awesome experience visiting Goodwill Computer Works - a dedicated tech store unlike any other thrift shop! Walked out with two full carts including a modded original Xbox, Mac Pro and a monster gaming PC from 2010 for absolutely insane prices. If you're in SoCal, this place is an absolute must-visit for tech bargains.
