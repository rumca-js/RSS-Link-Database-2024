I colorized, restored and applied face restoration and created a sound design for this French silent film showing the country streets outside Paris in the 1900s, so you can clearly see what's going on in broad daylight,

Video Restoration Process:
âœ” FPS boosted to 60 frames per second 
âœ” Image resolution boosted up to HD 
âœ” Improved video sharpness and brightness 
âœ” Colorized only for the ambiance (not historically accurate)
âœ”added sound design only for the ambiance
âœ”restoration:(stabilisation,denoise,cleand,deblur) 
âœ” Face Restoration
âœ” added modern Noise grain for a natural result. 

Please, be aware that colorization colors are not real and fake, colorization was made only for the ambiance and do not represent real historical data.
