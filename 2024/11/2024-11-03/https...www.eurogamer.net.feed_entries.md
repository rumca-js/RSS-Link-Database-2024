<img src="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/COD-SITE_YW4iWy9.jpg?width=1920&height=1920&fit=bounds&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp" /> <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> marks the return of developers Treyarch and Raven, a project four years in the making since Black Ops Cold War. In that time, there's been a technical upheaval of sorts. Firstly, Black Ops 6 moves to the IW9 engine, away from Treyarch's own custom engine. This aligns the game's technology with the most recent portfolio of Call of Duty titles and most crucially, the upcoming Warzone component. Using IW9, we'll soon see the gameplay systems in Black Ops 6's campaign roll out to its battle royale mode as well, including the so-called omni-movement that lets players sprint and dive in all directions.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-runs-well-on-ps5-and-series-x-but-last-gen-consoles-are-clearly-s

It's as much a ritual of mine as playing Super Mario World in the lead-up to Christmas - a personal yuletide delight I absolutely recommend. Batman is made for Halloween, for shadows and hauntings and pumpkin faces leering from misted windows. He dresses up. His enemies dress up. They plan tricks. He's a total treat.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arkhams-batman-is-the-perfect-companion-for-a-spooky-night-of-fun">Read more</a></p>
