Gaming headsets are truly the most mixed of bags. They are often overpriced and low quality. But still, gaming companies around the world are making TONS of them. From Razer's Barracuda headsets, to Logitech's Astro lineup, or even Steelseries and audiophile brands like Audeze it seems like everyone is trying to make it in the market. But it turns out NONE of those companies are the best sellers. Nope, that would be Turtle Beach, yes that Turtle Beach. So why the heck are you all buying the Recon 50 and Recon 70 Gaming Headsets? Let's find out.

Thanks to https://headphones.com/ for their testing!
