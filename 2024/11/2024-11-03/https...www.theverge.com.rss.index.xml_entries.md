  <p id="TTJwwK">Guess the artist, win five bucks. Whether you’re a random person on the streets of New York, an A-list celebrity, or the sitting Vice President of the United States, that’s the pitch behind one of the most fun music shows on social media. You show up, you get some headphones and a microphone, and you hope you know what song is playing. </p>
<p id="CheaZm">The show is called <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@trackstarshow"><em>Track Star</em></a>, and it’s hosted by Jack Coyne. On <a href="https://link.chtbl.com/vergecast">this episode of <em>The Vergecast</em></a>, the first in our three-part miniseries about the future of music, Coyne joins the show to tell us the story of <em>Track Star</em>

  <p id="3XaxNs">My favorite feature of the new $420,000, all-electric Rolls-Royce Spectre isn’t the cosseting ride quality or the illuminated stars embedded in the headliner of the insanely ornate interior. It isn’t the 577 horsepower or the 266 miles of range. It’s neither the “yes, that’s the spot” massaging seats nor the curbside presence of that upright, chromed front grille.
