Back in the 80s, it was the RPG to play with its story-telling, combat, characters, and incredible visuals.\n\nThough it's not on the same scale of popularity these days, Dragon Quest remains a successful franchise. And like most companies, it makes sense for the publisher to revisit and remake one of its most beloved titles - Dragon Quest 3. Launching on November 14th, Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake will be available for Xbox Series X/S, PS5, PC, and Nintendo Switch.\n\nMuch of the gameplay systems and story remain intact. However, developer Artdink is adding new story episodes, more involved Monster Arenas, and various quality-of-life features to go with the gorgeous \"HD-2D\" look. Check out everything you should know about the remake before jumping in.", "id": 1446110, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDECMWviE5M", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 129, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/SDECMWviE5M/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake - 15 Things You Need To Know Before You Buy", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-11-03T13:30:37+00:00", "description": "So,\u00a0is\u00a0The Veilguard\u00a0good enough to be better than\u00a0Origins?
