Red Lobster exited bankruptcy in September after decades of declining sales and a disastrous all-you-can-eat shrimp promotion. Now, they’ve hired 35-year-old Damola Adamolekun as its new CEO to see the brand through bankruptcy and out the other side. Adamolekun revitalized P.F. Chang’s during Covid and hopes to do the same for America’s oldest seafood chain.
