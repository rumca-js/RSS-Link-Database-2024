Basically everyone except owner Brent Dickman has left the company, including his co-owner. </p> <p>It\u2019s a shame they seem to be hiding this? Instead of being honest and letting everyone know what is up, they are just ignoring everyone inquiring about their projects\u2014 which is basically the worst way they could handle this.</p> <p>It\u2019s sad since they have made so many solid games. Even if they turn things around now, there is no way they will ever build up trust again as a company because they don\u2019t understand how to be courteous and communicative. </p> <p>I feel bad for the designers, artists and backers who put their trust in Brent.</p> </div><!", "id": 1533045, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1gtsdvn/elf_creek_games_is_likely_finished", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 473, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Elf Creek Games is likely finished", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-11-18T00:37:23+00:00", "description": "<table> <tr><td> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1gts9ih/i_just_completed_this_cyberpunk_dice_tower_with/\"> <img src=\"https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/q4o1yY9G4tmeYrNzZL1612cMEiKQR4xXqVrZdvy7x10.jpg\" alt=\"I just completed this Cyberpunk dice tower with lots of lights and detail on all sides.

Its called Tie Interceptor and it says &quot;reveal the top card of the galaxy deck if its an empire card draw 1 card. If it is an enemy card discard it&quot;. What confuses me is this. In the case of the top card being empire type where do i draw from? My deck or the galaxy deck and what happens with the revealed card? Just wanna know how you guys play this card.I&#39;m sorry if the answer is something obvious we are both noobies when it comes to board games. </p> <", "id": 1533495, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1gtrmy9/need_a_help_with_card_description", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 473, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://preview.redd.it/ue4kyebgxj1e1.jpeg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=6272967e891a60367722feea312f873874f6317b", "title": "Need a help with card description", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-11-18T00:05:50+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>My wife and I love to play, but if setup is a chore we probably won&#39;t bring it out too often.
