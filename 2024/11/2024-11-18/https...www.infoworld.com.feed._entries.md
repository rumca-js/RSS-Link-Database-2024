<p>As much as we love them, programming languages can often feel like straitjackets. They’re a complex bundle of syntactic rules, and if we break them–even once–the compiler starts screaming out error messages. There are conventions to define every little thing, such as the best way to name variables or how to indent your code. The language designers claim these constraints are a feature, not a bug.</p>



<p>But programming languages don’t need to be that way. Over the years, clever developers have come up with sneaky and not so sneaky ways to write code in their own idiosyncratic styles. Preprocessors can bridge the gap, jumping into the pipeline before the code is compiled to fix all the strang

<p>In the last decade, every web application developer has become an API designer. But most organizations do not think of developers as API designers, nor do they think about APIs as a product of design — to the detriment of their developers’ productivity. With the rise of AI, there are more APIs than ever before, making this problem even worse.</p>



<p>In this article, I’ll talk about the often-neglected internal APIs that, more and more, accidentally power businesses and how organizations can get back on top of these APIs.</p>

<p>“Nobody cares if you contribute.” That’s what a Postgres friend said to me during lunch at KubeCon when I suggested that hiring Postgres contributors could be a selling point for customers. His comment surprised me because for years I’ve believed the open source dogma that contributions somehow qualified developers and vendors to disproportionately profit from projects. This, despite the overwhelming evidence to the contrary.</p>



<p>For example, no one has benefited more from open source than AWS but, relatively speaking, no one has contributed less. AWS has started to change, which <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/aws-getting-better-at-open-source/">I’ve celebrated</a>. But aft
