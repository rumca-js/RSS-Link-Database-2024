Whamm! A WebAssembly Bytecode Instrumentation DSL - Elizabeth Gilbert, Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)

Debugging and profiling programs is done through instrumenting the program-under-observation (inserting instructions to monitor dynamic execution). The most-common techniques inject instructions directly into the program. While this enables tools to support any domain, it intrudes on the program state space, complicates the implementation, limits the scope of observation, and cannot dynamically adapt. These issues can be remedied by interfacing with an engine, like Wizard, with instrumentation support. 

A recent ASPLOS paper demonstrated how to build support that protects the application, provides consistency guarantees, applies JIT optimizations, and more. However, this technique limits a tool's scope to programs that can run on such engines. This talk presents the design of a new instrumentation DSL for Wasm that abstracts above the injection technique enabling tooling to suppo

wRPC: Distributed Components, No Assembly Required - Roman Volosatovs & Taylor Thomas, Cosmonic

One of the most beloved features of the component model is extensibility. As the WebAssembly ecosystem continues to grow, the WebAssembly community will need extensibility beyond component composition to build everything from plugins to fully distributed microservices and everything in between. This is where wRPC (WIT-RPC), a WebAssembly component-native, transport-agnostic RPC protocol and framework comes in. wRPC facilitates WIT (WebAssembly Interface Type) defined composition over network, IPC, or other means of communication. 

What this means is every WebAssembly component can be used with wRPC out-of-the-box using your execution model of choice. This talk will discuss why wRPC exists, the design behind it, and how you can integrate it with your WebAssembly runtimes and platforms. Through many diagrams and demos, you’ll learn why wRPC is important and how it can be used to create reu

Distributing and Running Containers for Wasm-Enabled Environments - Kohei Tokunaga, NTT

WebAssembly(Wasm) is expanding its adoption as a secure and portable binary format. However, the lack of compatibility for the current system (e.g. Linux) makes it harder to port existing applications to Wasm-enabled environments.

container2wasm is a tool that enables to run existing Linux-based containerized applications inside Wasm VM. This expands the portability of containers further by enabling them to run anywhere Wasm is supported, including browsers. This talk will focus on the latest works of container2wasm, including wider guest architecture support (including AArch64) leveraging QEMU and the ability to fetch and run container images directly on the browser without image conversion.

Lightning Talk: From Server to Client: Ruby on Rails on WebAssembly - Vladimir Dementyev, Evil Martians

Ruby on Rails is a famous “batteries included” framework for the rapid development of web applications. Its full-stack promise comes in a server-oriented, or HTML-over-the-Wire flavor: a server oversees everything from database interactions to your application UI/UX. And whenever there is a server involved, the network and its unpredictability come into play. No matter how much you enjoy developing with Rails, it would be hard to achieve the same level of user experience as with client-side and especially local-first frameworks. And here comes Wasm. With the help of WebAssembly, we can do a radical shift—bring the Rails application right into your browser, and make it local-first! In my talk, I want to discuss the challenges of making a classic web framework Wasm compatible, the techniques we can use to run server-first applications in the browsers and what are the use cases.

The Future of Green Cloud: Serverless WebAssembly on Arm64 Architecture - Kate Goldenring, Fermyon & Aaron Williams, Ampere Computing

The software carbon intensity (SCI) of an application is the sum of its operational and embodied emissions. Serverless provides a path towards reducing operational emissions by running event-driven applications only as needed. However, traditional serverless platforms face limitations due to slow startup times of MicroVMs and containers. WebAssembly (Wasm) addresses this with sub-millisecond startups, lowering SCI. Furthermore, Wasm is platform-agnostic, enabling applications to be built once and run anywhere, continually optimizing for the greenest architecture, such as Arm64. Ampere Arm64 CPUs use 2.8x less power than equivalent x86_64 CPUs, offering lower SCI by improving "performance per watt”. This talk will cover the sustainable features of Wasm and Arm64 and demonstrate deploying serverless Wasm applications on Kubernetes using open-source tool
