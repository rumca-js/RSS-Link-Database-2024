Since I filmed this video, a number of THINGS have happened, including the re-election of Donald Trump. One thing about Donald Trump you never really know what he means by anything he says, but my overall analysis is that this probably slows this down because one thing that is bad for very large-scale projects is a LACK OF LONG TERM CLARITY, and having a couple of knuckleheads threatening to eliminate a third of the government isn't great for long-term clarity.

I don't think it changes the politics or the science, but regulations and approvals are the biggest concern here, and unless someone is actually focused on that, it's going to get kicked down the road. 

But things do continue to move...here's a bunch of nuclear energy news just from the last week:

US to triple nuclear capacity by 2050: https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/us-sets-targets-triple-nuclear-energy-capacity-2050
