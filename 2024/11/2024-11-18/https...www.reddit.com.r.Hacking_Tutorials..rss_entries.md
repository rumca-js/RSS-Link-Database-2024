<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Soo straight to the point: how do I enhance my phones wifi receiver significantly? Saw in another Video a guy modifying his tp link antenna with copperplates and a screw. could you just connect it to your phone via an usb to usb c adapter? Any software required that the phone would use the external antenna instead of the build in one? You got cheaper or better ideas? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Level_Camp_2477"> /u/Level_Camp_2477 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking_Tutorials/comments/1gubvq1/enhancing_the_wifi_receiver_on_your_mobile_phone/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking_Tutorials/comments/1gubvq1/enhancing_the_wifi_receiver_on_your_mobile_phone/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I had a question so I have a spare laptop it&#39;s Lenovo t480s wondering If it&#39;s worth installing Kali or parrot is it. For projects in CTFs, I normally run everything off my new laptop cuz this was my old one I primarily use windows with WSL2 and virtual machines to do everything. Or raspberry pi / a tablet. Is it worth setting up or just leave it in the closet? I&#39;m assuming it could be used for CTFs as well as other projects was like a portable working rig. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/LucidH3X"> /u/LucidH3X </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking_Tutorials/comments/1gu74gz/spare_laptop_question/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking_Tutorials/comments/1gu74gz/spare_laptop_question/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello all,</p> <p>​First time poster here. I just wanted to know what tools you guys have/use and how you practice your skills? </p> <p>I am currently doing school and want to find the best way to legally practice the things I am learning. I know I can use websites like tryhackme or hackthebox (which I do) but I would like to practice and fool around with my home network and devices. </p> <p>​For example, if I wanted to practice on my PC would booting up a VM be successful? Or would I be best off buying a cheap laptop of some sort and be able to practice from my PC on that. Thank you for any help. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Nicholas1531"> /u/Nicholas1531 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking_Tutorials/comments/1gtx567/how_do_you_practice/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking_Tutorials/comments/1gtx567/how_do_you_practice/">[comments]<
