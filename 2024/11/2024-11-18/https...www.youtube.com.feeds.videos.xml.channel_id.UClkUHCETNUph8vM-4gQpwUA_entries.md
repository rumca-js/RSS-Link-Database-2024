Light No Fire Gameplay FIRST LOOK - Fantasy SURVIVAL on GIGANTIC Scale!
Light No Fire is the latest ambitious project from Hello Games, the studio best known for No Man’s Sky. Officially announced during The Game Awards in December 2023, this game has been in quiet development for over five years. While details are still few, it’s clear that Hello Games is looking to push the boundaries of what’s possible yet again, taking the lessons they learned from their previous titles and channeling them into something even more ambitious. Though unlike No Man’s Sky, which revolves around countless procedurally generated planets, Light No Fire is focused on the creation of a single, massive Earth-sized procedurally generated world.
