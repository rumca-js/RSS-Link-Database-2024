🎙️ In this episode of the Cybernews Weekly podcast, our journalists dive into recent developments surrounding last year’s MOVEit vulnerability hacking spree. Sensitive employee data from major companies like Amazon, Delta Airlines, and Lenovo has been meticulously organized and leaked, sparking concerns about potential spear-phishing attacks and broader cybersecurity implications. The discussion then shifts to social media, focusing on the rise of BlueSky as an emerging platform for users disenchanted with Elon Musk’s X (formerly Twitter).
