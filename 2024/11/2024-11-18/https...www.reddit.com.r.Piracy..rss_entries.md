<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I recently adopted my 7-year-old son from Colombia and we&#39;ve bonded over watching movies together. While the major streaming services have Spanish audio options for a lot of titles, there&#39;s quite a few titles that only have English audio. I&#39;ve been hunting for more Spanish dubs but am not having much luck on the usual trackers. Anyone know of any good sources for movies with Spanish language tracks?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/sbamkmfdmdfmk"> /u/sbamkmfdmdfmk </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1gui0h8/spanish_dubs/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1gui0h8/spanish_dubs/">[comments]</a></span>
