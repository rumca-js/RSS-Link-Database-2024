A saber-toothed kitten, frozen in Siberian permafrost for 37,000 years, has provided an unprecedented look at the extinct predator Homotherium latidens. Unearthed near the Arctic Circle, the well-preserved cub retains soft brown fur, intact whiskers, sharp claws, and footpads, offering unique insights into its anatomy. Radiocarbon dating revealed the kitten lived during the late Pleistocene epoch and was only three weeks old when it died. Researchers noted its stout neck, twice as thick as a modern lion’s, and broad feet adapted for snowy terrains. These findings highlight the evolutionary adaptations of Homotherium, a species that shared traits with lions but featured a shorter body and longer limbs. The discovery sheds new light on ancient ecosystems and ice-age predators.

A team of researchers from the Korea Institute of Machinery and Materials (KIMM) has developed a morphing wheel that can adapt to a range of obstacles, making it suitable for use in wheelchairs, unmanned delivery vehicles, and robots. The wheel can overcome obstacles up to 1.3 times its radius in height, offering a flexible solution to enhance mobility on uneven terrain. The technology has been tested in prototypes, including wheelchairs that climb stairs and devices achieving speeds of up to 30 km/h. KIMM aims to further refine the technology for faster speeds and broader applications.

Experts believe octopuses could rise as the dominant species on Earth if humans were to face extinction, due to factors like climate change or war. With their advanced intelligence, adaptability, and ability to use tools, octopuses are seen as prime candidates for developing complex societies. While unlikely to fully adapt to land life, they could evolve methods to extend their time out of water, potentially leading to underwater cities. Their ability to manipulate their environment and solve complex problems gives them an edge in a post-human world, though evolution remains unpredictable.
