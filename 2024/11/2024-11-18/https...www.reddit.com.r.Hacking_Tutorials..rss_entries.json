For projects in CTFs, I normally run everything off my new laptop cuz this was my old one I primarily use windows with WSL2 and virtual machines to do everything. Or raspberry pi / a tablet. Is it worth setting up or just leave it in the closet?

I just wanted to know what tools you guys have/use and how you practice your skills? </p> <p>I am currently doing school and want to find the best way to legally practice the things I am learning. I know I can use websites like tryhackme or hackthebox (which I do) but I would like to practice and fool around with my home network and devices. </p> <p>\u200bFor example, if I wanted to practice on my PC would booting up a VM be successful? Or would I be best off buying a cheap laptop of some sort and be able to practice from my PC on that. Thank you for any help. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Nicholas1531\"> /u/Nicholas1531 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking_Tutorials/comments/1gtx567/how_do_you_practice/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking_Tutorials/comments/1gtx567/how_do_you_practice/\">[comments]<", "id": 1533625, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking_Tutorials/comments/1gtx567/how_do_you_practice", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 535, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking_Tutorials/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "How do you practice?", "vote": 0}]
