However, accessing GPU resources for rendering graphics or performing compute operations has been challenging for Wasm applications, especially outside of the browser. Enter wasi-webgpu, a Phase 1 WASI proposal that bridges this gap by exposing the WebGPU API to Wasm guest code through the Component Model. With wasi-webgpu, any Wasm application can leverage the power of any GPU to render stunning 2D and 3D graphics and execute advanced AI algorithms. This talk will explore the design and capabilities of wasi-webgpu, demonstrating how it empowers developers to build high-performance applications that seamlessly integrate GPU functionality.
