How to fix uneven subfloors…for small uneven areas I use Henry or Ardex Feather Finish. I mix it with cold, clean water (always important) and apply it to the plywood. Then I use the flat side of my trowel or a joint compound knife to spread it. This cures fast and is a great option 👍🏽🔥#flooring #homerepair #homerenovation
