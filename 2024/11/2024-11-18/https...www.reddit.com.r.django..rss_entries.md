<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m taking over an old django 3.x project with tons of JS/JQuery in many files and folders, needing a lot of JS work.</p> <p>Debugging JS errors, often the console shows an error much deeper in the JS than it really is with a view-name:100 link to source.</p> <p>So not only is this not actual error oftentimes it&#39;s hard to locate the true source even if it is. I don&#39;t see anyway to get a back trace to try and gauge where the real error is.</p> <p>It seems like there has to be a better way to debug JS and develop it ? We&#39;ve tried the debug toolbar but have not been able to get it working.</p> <p>Suggestions?

As a result, I still haven’t managed to make them communicate perfectly.</p> <p>I&#39;m currently at a technical deadlock.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello Django people,</p> <p>As a CTO, I use Django extensively for my projects. But I also use a lot of no-code for the speed of development that it provides. It&#39;s also great to be able to interact with an API without actually having to write code to consume that API.</p> <p>Which brings me to the topic : I don&#39;t see a reason why we couldn&#39;t build a Zapier/Make alternative that would allow admin users to build their automations. This means we could use native django models as triggers (new object =&gt; trigger zap) or as targets (receive webhook =&gt; delete object).</p> <p>We would start with a few key integrations, and then any django developer could contribute their own integrations if they needed to add a new service to their own app.</p> <p>Does such a thing exist ? Should we build it ? Would you use it ?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Brachamul"> /u/Brachamul </a> <br/> <span><
