The weird thing is that, sometimes when I verify the files, it seems that it&#39;s fine but, the same file later might get an error in 01 bin file if I try to verify again. I tried every suggestion in her website and also whatever else I could find online, nothing helped. </p> <p>However, as a last option I tried to save the game file from the installation, into my HDD (I got 2 SSDs and 1 HDD, in both SSDS i get the same error). It worked and then when I moved the game files to my SSD, the game was working just fine. It doesn&#39;t make sense for it to be a drive issue, since I can play other games just fine and I could also run the game normally with my SSD.
