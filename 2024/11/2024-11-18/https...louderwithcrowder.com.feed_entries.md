So while they thought giving him more felonies than mass murderers for nothing more than an "accounting error" was going to help them, it did the exact opposite. </p><p>Joe Rogan claimed one of the reasons he has grown to appreciate and like Trump is because of his ability to expose how corrupt the establishment is.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">NEW: Joe Rogan says he has grown to like Trump, says Trump made him realize that sometimes it takes someone "completely crazy" to expose the system.<br/><br/>"You're getting what you get, that's who the guy is... I've grown to like him."<br/><br/>"As time went on I wa

Thus, males began to compete against females in sports at an alarming rate. However, given how objectively wrong, misogynistic, and pseudoscientific this is, people are rightfully alarmed. And given that progressives are the masters of psychological projection, people like John Oliver are turning this around on you, as if you are crying about spilled milk. </p><p>Oliver claimed there is no evidence transgender students pose a threat to fairness in sports and today’s show breaks down why he is so blatantly wrong. </p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube">

One is a popular saying, the other is Andrew Breitbart's popular version of the saying. Whichever is swimming toward the other, something has happened since Election Day. Any concern Americans have had in admitting they didn't hate Donald Trump, let alone that they like him, is gone. And not just in diners and at Little League games. Professional athletes are showing their love by performing the Trump dance in celebration of winning.</p><p>Most notable was the undisputed GOAT, UFC Heavyweight Champion Jon Jones. After dominating Stipe Miocic, Jones did the dance with Trump in attendance and even gave the President-Elect a shout-out.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Jon Jones did an impressio

## NYT dropped a "fact" check on RFK Jr. and Froot Loops so ridiculous it needs to be marveled at

I have concerns with RFK Jr. when it comes to vaccines and abortion, and the number of conservatives calling on food to be banned gives me the ick. I'm also old enough to remember before Pfizer became a wing of the Democrat Party when we were allowed to criticize Big Pharma, and Kennedy is a better pick for HHS than anyone Kamala Harris would have chosen. Plus, the media hates him, as this New York Times "fact" check will tell you. That alone makes him qualified to run things.</p><p>It's not just the NYT. Politico brought the unironic comedy, lamenting that lobbyists (pause) are upset about the RFK Jr. pick. </p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">I mean... <a href="https://t.co/0Yhl4uDj8m">pic.twitter.com/0Yhl4uDj8m</a><br/>— Brodigan (@brodigan) <a href="https://twitter.com/brodigan/stat
