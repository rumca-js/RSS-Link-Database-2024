Recently, as you may know, GoDaddy changed its policies and disabled the use of API with no extra cost. So I migrate my domains to OVH. When I was looking methods and existing programs for updating, I realised that all were using DynHost (a duckdns-look-alike of OVH, that you will create and associate with your subdomains) instead of the official API, that easily allows you to update your ip.</p> <p>So I created ovh-ip-updater, a Docker container that allows you to update the IP of your subdomains (and also create the subdomain if it does not exist!) using the API instead of your dynhost user. </p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/myanesp/ovh-ip-updater\">GitHub repo</a></p> <p>Please, open an issue (or leave it here) if you want a feature that is missing and star the repo if it is useful!<br/> Thanks, glad to make a li", "id": 1537841, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1gub3w3/ovh_ip_updater_my_first_selfhosted_project", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 450, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "OVH IP Updater - my first selfhosted project", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-11-18T18:01:02+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I am getting the following error when trying to add the blocklist referenced below even thought the file is in plain text.
