The S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series enjoyed its fair share of critical and commercial success back in the day, about a decade and a half ago (or thereabouts), but it's fair to say that many who'll be playing the upcoming S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl aren't going to go in with too much familiarity with its predecessors, if only thanks to how long it has been since the series' last instalment. There's a good chance, then, that many are going to be surprised by what kind of experience it's going to be.

Developed Grove Street Games spent some time deploying fixes, but the most sweeping update arrived last year when Video Games Deluxe and Netflix launched the mobile versions. Out of nowhere, Rockstar has released it for other platforms, restoring the classic lighting, adding volumetric fog, fixing broken animations, and much more.

After three years and a terrible launch, is the remastered trilogy worth revisiting? Is it finally worth settling in and enjoying the classics as they're meant to be enjoyed? Does it even justify the $60 price tag as it currently stands? Find out more here.
