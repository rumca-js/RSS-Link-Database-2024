The Baka pygmies of Cameroon are an Indigenous hunter-gatherer community living primarily in the dense rainforests of southeastern Cameroon and neighbouring regions of Central Africa. Renowned for their deep connection to the forest, the Baka sustain their livelihoods through traditional activities such as hunting, fishing, and gathering wild fruits and medicinal plants. They have a rich oral tradition, with music, dance, and storytelling central to their culture. Their polyphonic singing and yodeling are particularly famous and are often used during spiritual rituals and celebrations. Despite their remarkable resilience, the Baka face significant challenges, including deforestation, displacement, and socio-economic marginalization, which threaten their traditional way of life. Efforts to support the Baka often center around recognizing their land rights and preserving their cultural heritage.
