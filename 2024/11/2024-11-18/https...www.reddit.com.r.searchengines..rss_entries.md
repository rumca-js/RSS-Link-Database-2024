<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I submit my post links to Google every time I make a new post. I have it all set up on Google Search console as I have for years. All my links are showing as Indexed.<br/> Here&#39;s what I&#39;m noticing.<br/> No indication that Google is referring ANY traffic to my site in the stats. But every other search engine shows up like Bing (Most refers so far) Yandex, Yahoo and so on. But NOTHING from Google. I am getting traffic from all the other search engines, except for Google.</p> <p>If I search for the title of a post in Google using quotation marks, my post doesn&#39;t show up in the results, even though the search console says that it is indexed.</p> <p>Has anyone else run into this problem, and if so, did you find a fix?</p> <p>I use RankMath with WordPress<br/> I don&#39;t believe it&#39;s a content issue because I&#39;m getting lots of referrals from the other search engines.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://ww
