<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>are there any billionaire romances where there is polyamory involved? either the poorer mc has a relationship already and they both agree to pursue the billionaire and they&#39;re up for it, or the billionaire has a relationship and they want to introduce a third? or literally anything else in between</p> <p>I&#39;ve kept this gender neutral on the pronouns because I genuinely don&#39;t care if it&#39;s M/M/M, F/F/F, M/F/F, M/M/F or any other combination inbetween even with more partners in there, I just want good stories that people would recommend based on this trope. </p> <p>one thing I don&#39;t particularly like in billionaire stories is a prideful mc who doesn&#39;t want to take money to help out their situation when they are literally on the poverty line, so if you could mention if you&#39;re recommending a story with that included I would appreciate it</p> <p>edit: I don&#39;t like to read v type polyamory, I prefer everyone to get equal love

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi, I’m looking for some books to read on train and before sleep. I’m currently pretty depressed after a breakup, read Normal People because a friend recommended it to me and it broke me. I’m looking for something shorter (around 400 pages maximum, definitely shorter than Karamazov brothers). I’m very open to classics. I’m a 22 years old guy so any ‘life-changing’ books are also cool (never read any self-improvement books, considering Thinking, Fast and Slow). For the past 4 years I read almost nothing except football/computer science books. Some of my favorites are:</p> <p>-Lolita (loved the writing style of Nabokov, read Pale Fire also)</p> <p>-1984, Brave New World, Animal Farm, Fahrenheit 451, Lord of the flies, Do androids dream of electric sheep</p> <p>-The Stranger, The Fall (read almost everything by Camus)</p> <p>-Solaris (great plot and philosophical)</p> <p>-Picnic at hanging rock</p> <p>-Metro, Asoiaf, Witcher</p> <p>-Crime and punishment

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Not sure how to describe exactly what I am searching for. I guess I have been struggling with my sexuality since I was a little kid. It’s really left me feeling isolated from the rest of the world. I’ve often found myself healed through movies and tv series though even if just for a moment. Now I’m not much of a reader but I’d like to find a book that could make me feel healed that same way. A little less lonely and more accepting of myself. Fiction or Non-fiction either works. Something more positive and inspiring. I’m a gay man so I feel like I’d gravitate more towards gay male stories but I’m open to anything queer.

(I read fantasy books) I also offered her books like Harry Potter and even some horror novels by Stephen King, but she still refused. However, she has read one book of her choice, and she said she really enjoyed it.</p> <p>The book was written in the style of a diary by a cat. The cat wrote about her life with her family. I think it was funny and very silly.</p> <p>Could anyone recommend some books I could buy for her this Christmas? Maybe something similar to that cat diary or any teen/young adult books she might enjoy? Books that could possibly get her into reading.</p> </div><!-- SC

It felt fresh and the ending disappointed me (in a good way) Severance by Ling Ma Tender is the Flesh-I wanted to dry heave for most of the book, but finished it in a day. I couldn’t stop reading. The Goddess Chronicles by Natsuo Kirino. I also loved Out by her, and plan to read Grostesque.</p> <p>Other favorites have been: Killing Commendatore by Haruki Murakami Ghost Bride by Yangsze Choo (I’ve read a few of her other books too) Station Eleven The Memory Police</p> <p>Any recommendations based off these styles?

I think Marvel is really well suited to this, but there&#39;s a bunch of other fiction franchises that could have their story told similarly. DC, obviously, but also Star Wars (in particular the development of the EU and the prequels during the 90s), Star Trek, Doctor Who, Warhammer, Judge Dredd, DnD, etc. I know very little about most of these franchises and would be interested in learning more.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I really like the sort of story that Snowpiercer and the Silo trilogy are. Unusual worlds with their own unusual rules but grounded in reality, I guess post apocalyptic but the suffering from the world ending is not the main point, it&#39;s the weird sorts of relationships, social structures and class systems that evolve from the unusual circumstances. I really like these weird unusual worlds, I like learning about these closed self-contained systems like vaults in fallout, the silo, Snowpiercer, underground bunkers, that sort of thing. Sealed-off societies. I hope I&#39;m being clear enough!</p> <p>Bonus points for anything LGBT+ as I&#39;m a gay man and never get to read a good gay guy story that isn&#39;t just a smut book 😖 and more bonus points for anything involving mysteries and secrets, I feel like it&#39;s a prerequisite of the genre anyway but I thought I would mention. </p> <p>Also I hate Lord of the rings. Please do not recommend any books

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I just recently read “All the ugly and wonderful things” and I absolutely loved it despite the controversial topic. I really enjoyed the main character, and the story as a whole. I’ve tried reading suggested titles like “My dark vanessa” but it’s not nearly the same. </p> <p>I also really enjoyed “If he had been with me”. I quite love books that make me FEEL something and I’m dying to find something like those 2 books again. </p> <p>I have read all of the Ellen Hopkins books, I have “A little life” in my TBR, along with “Convenience store woman” and “Earthlings”. Can anyone suggest a really good, gut wrenching or wholesome story with dynamic characters?
