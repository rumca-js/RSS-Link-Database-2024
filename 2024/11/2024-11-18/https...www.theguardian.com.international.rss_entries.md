<p>No politician can win without a coalition of voters. Do Democrats know who theirs are?</p><p>In September 1981, 10 months after Ronald Reagan’s sweeping 44-state victory over Jimmy Carter, 100 leading elected Democratic officials privately convened to formulate a response to Reaganism. Alan Cranston of California, the Senate minority whip, began the meeting with a fundamental question: “If our party is a coalition, unlike the Republicans, who tend to represent a single group, what are the common denominators, transcending regional differences and local interests, which make us a national party?”</p><p>In the four decades since the fracturing of the New Deal order, an answer to this question has largely eluded the Democratic party. Of the United States’ 20 highest-median-income states, Kamala Harris won 18; of the 20 lowest, Harris won just three. Democrats reliably win the counties that produce the majority of American economic output; Harris’s losing base consisted of counties <a

In the early slate, there was the now 8-2 Pittsburgh Steelers v the now 7-4 Baltimore Ravens. In the late slate, it was the Kansas City Chiefs v the Buffalo Bills.</p><p>Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson has been great against most opponents as a passer, but the Steelers have had his number. In six previous career games against Baltimore’s most prominent divisional opponent, Jackson had completed 78 passes on 132 attempts for 870 yards, four touchdowns, seven interceptions, and a passer rating of 66.8 – by far his lowest against any opponent. And against Pittsburgh on Sunday, Jackson completed just 16 of 33 passes for 207 yards, one touchdown, one interception, and a passer rating of… 66.1. Pittsburgh has a knack for

<p>Philosopher Simon Critchley’s painstaking attempt<em> </em>to explore transcendent experience provides a fascinating overview of Christianity’s great outliers</p><p>I sometimes think of mysticism – the name we give to ecstatic, transformative experiences of absorption into absolute reality or, if you will, into God – as the subject that fascinates where all others merely interest. And yet it denotes something singularly hard to talk or write about, indeed virtually defined by its ineffability. <em>On Mysticism</em>, the philosopher Simon Critchley’s stab at effing the ineffable, feels oddly timely. As he notes: “There is an awful lot of mysticism about. More than ever in recent years.” He doesn’t speculate, but the widespread interest may point to that metaphysical restlessness that wells up during periods of acute cultural change – the return of the transcendental to a reality system no longer adequate for the times.</p><p>Among the more widely read and prolific of modern academi

<p>As authoritarians triumph by lying and scapegoating, there is no hope for centrists doubling down on a broken neoliberal system</p><p>The most useful lesson of growing up under a dictatorship is that dictatorships are never absolute. Sometimes they are even democracies – ones that thrive by co-opting those with proximity to power and managing those who do not benefit. That management is often through brute oppression, but mainly it is through securing consent by convincing enough people that things are about to get really great. Any minute now, once the enemies of the people are thwarted, a corner will be turned. Authoritarian democracies recognise anger, foment it, then bottle it for their own purposes.</p><p>The trick is to always have a horizon, distant but in sight, beyond which things will get better. While this happens, the trappings of national success assuage the masses and give a sense of power, prosperity and momentum. In Egypt, as the jails swelled with political prison
