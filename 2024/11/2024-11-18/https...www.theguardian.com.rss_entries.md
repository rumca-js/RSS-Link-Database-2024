<p>The origins of the mysterious Bene Gesserit sisterhood are uncovered in this starry and intense prequel to the fantasy saga that would have been unthinkable even 10 years ago</p><p>Welcome to the Sisterhood – equal parts nunnery, finishing school, psychic gymnasium and political thinktank. Run by wise older ladies decked out in austere black, educating impulsive young women to become the sage leaders of the future, its project is to nurture a heroine who can run the Sisterhood’s home planet, as well as all the neighbouring ones. It might just save humanity.</p><p>In 10 millennia’s time, the Sisterhood will become the Bene Gesserit, a band of women with formidable mind-control abilities who feature in Frank Herbert’s 1965 book Dune and its film adaptations: Rebecca Ferguson, Charlotte Rampling and Léa Seydoux played BG members in the Denis Villeneuve movies. Dune: Prophecy – a six-part drama inspired, vaguely controversially, not by Herbert’s own canonical writing, but by a spin-of

## Andy Robertson’s late header in Poland gifts Scotland Nations League lifeline

<p></p><p>Scotland had contributed far too much to the Nations League to finish bottom of Group A1. That was the harsh reality until Andy Robertson’s glorious stoppage-time header, which secured a famous win over Poland. Steve Clarke’s team live on, courtesy of a playoff berth.</p><p>When John McGinn sent Scotland ahead, thoughts were of another outcome. Had the result gone their way between Croatia and Portugal, it was conceivable Clarke’s men could finish second. Ultimately that other tie was immaterial but this one was not. Scotland and their support celebrated in epic style courtesy of Robertson’s intervention, which instead sends Poland into League B. This felt poetic, at the venue for the Liverpool full-back’s Scotland debut and, on this occasion, the earning of his 80th cap. It was the latest triumph for Clarke’s management.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/18/poland-v-scotland-nations-league-group-a1-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

But accountability remains elusive</p><p>As an Israeli airstrike killed at least 30 <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvg5lw7edrlo">people</a> in a northern Gaza residential block, Pope Francis called for an <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/pope-urges-investigation-to-determine-whether-israel-has-committed-genocide-in-gaza-13255646">investigation</a> into whether genocide is being carried out under the cover of war.

And it was deliberate, a tactical decision that paid off. “We have dominated a lot of games possession-wise but tonight we were happy to sit behind the ball, be compact,” the midfielder Erin Cuthbert said. “It was more of a traditional performance but Sonia is a winner and will do whatever it takes to win. We got the tactics spot on.” The London team conceded possession but they dominated in every other area, with 15 shots to eight, six on target to two and 30 touches in the penalty area to 16. It is this tactical flexibility and nous that makes the Blues unpredictable and, in turn, difficult to play against. Chelsea look a coherent be

<p>Spiced, vinegary tomatoes provide a tangy base for this Sri Lankan-style aubergine and bean curry</p><p>Today’s recipe takes great liberties with the base for the classic Sri Lankan aubergine pickle, <em>wambatu moju</em>, in which deep-fried aubergine and onions combine with turmeric, vinegar, chilli and pickling spices to create a moreish side dish. Here, I’ve used the same pickling spice base, but combined it with tomatoes and beans for protein, to make a lovely, flavour-packed weeknight curry.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/nov/18/quick-and-easy-sri-lankan-style-aubergine-and-black-eyed-bean-curry-recipe-rukmini-iyer">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Brazilian’s brief return signalled another disappearing act and the question now is will he play for Al-Hilal again?</p><p>Seeing a substitute subbed off is rarely positive and that was the case on 4 November for Neymar. Off the bench in the second half of an AFC Champions League Elite match against Esteghlal of Iran, the 32-year-old was soon delighting fans in Riyadh with sombrero flicks and step-overs. There were more twists and turns but then, after 30 minutes, there was a pull. A slight stretch for the ball in the area and a second game back after a 12-month injury lay-off came to an end with yet another injury.</p><p>The Brazilian, no stranger to injuries, put a positive spin on it all. “Hopefully nothing too much ... It’s normal that after one year [out] this happens, the doctors had already warned me, so I have to be careful and play more minutes,” Neymar posted on social media. His manager at Al-Hilal, Jorge Jesus, was more circumspect. “Unfortunately it’s not a simple

No such grown-ups are expected to return.</p><p>Our only hope may be that Trump no longer must worry about re-election.

First unveiled at Cannes this year, the puckish elusiveness of the piece is announced in the title itself.</p><p>C’est Pas Moi, or It’s Not Me, is a cine-collage essay in the manner of Godard, although the audio soundtrack does not quite have that papier-mache roughness that Godard often created.

His tomcat cheeks, ear with a chunk missing and neck resembling an Elizabethan ruff sealed the deal.</p><p>After he arrived on the doorstep I followed the instructions to the letter. I kept him in one room to give him time to acclimatise, and didn’t crowd or fuss him.

<p>In the first of a new series in which writers explain their favourite mood-lifting watch, an ode to a charming 40s romance</p><p>In search of solace, I always turn to a film that will take me away from myself. I Know Where I’m Going! is, as you could absolutely guess if you didn’t know, a film about a journey. In this film from 1945, Joan (Wendy Hiller) a modern young woman with grand ideas, sets off by the sleeper train from Manchester to Scotland. Her stated destination is a Hebridean island where she plans to marry her wealthy industrialist fiance. But fate has other ideas in this magical film from the mercurial duo of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger.</p><p>The train journey is off-track from the start, tilted by Joan’s absurd bridal dreams, complete with Scottish hills draped in tartan, and the Archers’ whimsical camera trickery, which transforms a top hat into a smokestack. You just know that it’s curtains for Joan’s meticulous typewritten itinerary. In fact, danger awa

<p>This new series from Yellowstone creator Taylor Sheridan is absolutely packed with zingers. If only its attitude to women wasn’t so repellant</p><p>Most TV writers would love to be Taylor Sheridan. Some might profess not to be fans – they might even be snobby about his work, claiming it to be vulgar and too popular with American conservatives – but plenty crave the status he now enjoys: he is more famous than his shows. What’s Landman? It’s the new Taylor Sheridan.</p><p>And it is very Taylor Sheridan. His dramas tend to centre on hard but wise men, tersely but sagely dealing with problems where violence and death are not far away. In Sheridan’s breakthrough, Yellowstone, Kevin Costner is a Montana rancher fighting to preserve old traditions that cause him endless strife, which he nobly bears. In Mayor of Kingstown, Jeremy Renner is a fixer playing all sides in a Michigan prison town to prevent full-scale war between the criminal gangs, cops and prisoners. In the relatively happy-
