<p>If you want to upgrade your PC with a super-speedy, high-performance internal SSD, then you need to get one of these Samsung 990 Pros, which has <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Internal-Expansion-MZ-V9P2T0B-AM/dp/B0BHJJ9Y77/">dropped down to just $160 on Amazon</a>. That’s a stunning 36 percent discount off its original $250 price!</p>



<p>When we <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1344995/samsung-990-pro-nvme-ssd-review.html">reviewed the Samsung 990 Pro</a>, our only complaint was its price tag — and that’s obviously no longer an issue with this price drop that’ll put a smile on any serious PC owner’s face. In our review, we praised the drive’s performance and the fact that it’s available with and without a heat sink. (The heat sink model is also on sale, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Internal-Expansion-MZ-V9P2T0B-AM/dp/B0BHJDY

<p>Sometimes you just want to relax and hear your music or movie’s audio without being encumbered by wearing <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/544134/the-best-wireless-earbuds-free-yourself-from-the-tyranny-of-cords.html">headphones</a>. That’s especially the case if you’re enjoying your media with friends or family. The problem is that laptop speakers just often don’t have great sound; they can sound muffled, tinny, and/or lack audio fidelity. What you need instead is a good pair of PC speakers to get the best sound from your media files.</p>



<p>Luckily, you don’t need to buy a complete 7.1 surround sound system to feel satisfied. For less than $100, you can find some affordable PC speakers that provide quality audio. It’s true that at this price point you will need to make a few compromises, but the best budget computer speakers can still offer a

<p>It’s easy to think that all USB-C cables are the same, and that any claims to superiority are just a way to jack up the price. After all, it’s <em>just a cable</em>, right?</p>



<p>I applaud the consumer skepticism, but there actually can be differences. At PCWorld we have used a ton of USB-C cables and can say with certainty not all of them are made the same. In fact, there can be huge performance variances among cables when it comes to both charging and transferring data.</p>



<p>My hands-on evaluation of numerous cables — ranging from the biggest, most-recognizable brand-names to the cheapest of the cheap — has revealed some clear winners, which I highlight below.</p>

<p>Gamers worried that they may not be able to get decent performance in GSC Game World’s upcoming title <a href="https://www.stalker2.com/en"><em>Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl</em></a> have been thrown a bone by Nvidia in a blog post from the company showing impressive benchmark results that should put minds at ease.</p>



<p>The results show that, yes, it’s indeed possible to get decent results with just a mid-tier RTX 4070 GPU, which can hit an average 70FPS at 1080p. That drops to a still-respectable average 52FPS at 1440p, despite the game utilizing the Unreal Engine 5 build (with the tested configuration), which is one of the most resource-demanding to date.</p>



<p>And that’s with DLSS 3.0 switched off. When it’s on, the real magic happens… and gamers can expect double the performance, which was Nvidia’s main point in the blog post in the first pla

<p>I was a graphic designer in a former life, and I still do a lot of photography for keyboard reviews. So, despite being a PC gamer, I prefer color-accurate IPS panels over speedier VA panels.</p>



<p>But today you can get the best of both worlds for cheap. Dell is currently selling a <a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-27-gaming-monitor-g2724d/apd/210-bhxc/monitors-monitor-accessories">fast 27-inch IPS gaming monitor for just $150</a>. (That’s half off its original MSRP of $300!)</p>



<p>We’ve featured the Dell G2724HD monitor before — in fact, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1965138/dell-g2724d-review.html">it scored an Editors’ Choice in our review</a>. With a 27-inch 2560×1440 screen that refreshes at an impressive 165Hz, it’s great for showing off extra detail in new 3D games without breaking the bank.</p>

<p>Over the past week, many users around the world have received extortion emails sent via the Microsoft 365 Message Center.</p>



<p>These emails are demanding users to pay $2,000 worth of cryptocurrency to a specific address, under the threat of stealth nude webcam photos of them being leaked to family members, friends, and colleagues.</p>



<p>Normally, these kinds of emails are supposed to get caught by spam filters, but because they’re being sent via an official Microsoft address, they’ve managed to get through the eye of the needle.</p>



<p>It’s not entirely clear how these hackers managed to send the extortion emails as of this writing, but according to <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-365-admin-portal-abused-to-send-sextortion-emails/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/micros

<p>Dual-screen laptops are something, huh? They seemed to make a splash a couple of years ago with designs from Lenovo and Asus, but then they just kind of… stopped.</p>



<p>But according to a credible retailer leak, Asus is prepping an absolute monster of one for an upcoming release. This new design packs double 14-inch OLED screens and an Intel processor so new that it doesn’t officially exist yet… oh yes, and a huge price tag.</p>

<p>People often choose terrible passwords to protect their accounts. Don’t believe it? NordPass has proof—it analyzed leaked passwords to find the top 200 most common ones, and they’re bad. Think ‘crackable in less than one second’ bad.</p>



<p>At the top of the list is <em>123456</em>, followed by the as-easily cracked <em>123456789</em> and <em>12345678</em>. (Seems people love mashing numbers along their number row). The overwhelming majority of the 200 can be cracked in seconds, with several extending to a few hours and one particular exception of 12 days (<em>g_czechout</em>). Most noteworthy: The self-aware but still indefensible <em>changeme</em>, which can also be cracked in under a second.</p>
