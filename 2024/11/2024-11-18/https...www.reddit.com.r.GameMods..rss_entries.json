Unfortunately, the audio files don\u2019t show up, and the program sometimes closes instantly.</li> <li><strong>UPK Explorer</strong> \u2013 Similar result. The files don\u2019t appear, or the program crashes before I can access anything.</li> <li><strong>QuickBMS</strong> \u2013 I used the Unreal Engine 3 script, but it either doesn\u2019t locate any audio assets or isn\u2019t set up correctly for these games. If there\u2019s a specific script for the Arkham series, I\u2019d love to know!</li> <li><strong>FModel</strong> \u2013 Same thing I downloaded it tri", "id": 1533160, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/GameMods/comments/1gtssyn/need_help_extracting_audio_files_from_batman", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 533, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/GameMods/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Need Help Extracting Audio Files from Batman: Arkham City", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-11-18T00:23:16+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Specifically STORMSHOT </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Relative_Bed_6289\"> /u/Relative_Bed_6289 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/GameMods/comments/1gtrz91/i_need_someone_to_mod_a_game_for_me/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/GameMods/comments/1gtrz91/i_need_someone_to_mod_a_game_for_me/\">[comments]</a></span>", "id": 1532982, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/GameMods/comments/1gtrz91/i_need_someone_to_mod_a_game_for_me", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 533, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/GameMods/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "I need someone to mod a game for me", "vote": 0}]
