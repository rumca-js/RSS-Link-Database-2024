<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I saw Lucinda Williams at The Vet in Providence RI last friday. She was superb as was her 4 piece band. That included Marc Ford, formerly of The Black Crows. I didn&#39;t learn until after I booked the ticket that she had suffered a stroke 4 years ago and can not play guitar. But her vocals and singing were as strong as the first time I saw her 20 odd years ago on the west coast. Brilliant show and I&#39;m so glad I was able to go. And ticket price was only around $60ish. Unbelievable!!! If you get the opportunity, don&#39;t miss her!</p> <p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/tnvrmoc4qp1e1.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=83097fee3cf1d229b5631d3f9bde1cae8a13efa2">https://preview.redd.it/tnvrmoc4qp1e1.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=83097fee3cf1d229b5631d3f9bde1cae8a13efa2</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Chris___M"> /u/Chris___M </a> <br/> <span><a href="http

Do you start with your melody or maybe drums?
