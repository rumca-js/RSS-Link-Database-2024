Today on the Matt Walsh Show, we'll dive deeper into the utterly dystopian policies being put in place all over the world in the name of so-called "indigenous rights." Also, the Biden regime has decided to leave Trump a nice gift for his first day in office — and that gift is World War III. The Jake Paul-Mike Tyson fight played out exactly as I said it would. We'll talk about the lessons we can learn from that sad spectacle. And, a writer for Variety is very personally hurt and offended that we submitted our film, “Am I Racist?”, for Academy Award consideration.
