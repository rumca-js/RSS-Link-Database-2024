<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Today I thought it would be practical for OSINT if there was a searchable archive containing clothing items, the online shops they were sold in and corresponding time period when they were sold. However, I highly doubt this is legally possible due to two main reasons:</p> <ol> <li><p>The item&#39;s images might be copyrighted.</p></li> <li><p>You&#39;re basically copying the database of each shop by doing so.</p> <p>Does anybody know more about this and if there is a way do this legally in theory? Also there might be differences between countries that need to be researched in detail. (I know that a project like this would require a lot of work, difficulties and financial resources in practice, but I&#39;m just wondering about laws at the moment.)</p></li> </ol> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/WonicTater"> /u/WonicTater </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1guivty/sc
