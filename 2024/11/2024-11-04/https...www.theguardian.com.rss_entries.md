<p>Bedlam. One moment of ingenuity to shatter Brentford’s resistance. Time was running out when Fulham, who had dominated from the first whistle, launched one more attack and two substitutes combined. Adama Traoré crossed and Harry Wilson, contorting his body at a ridiculous angle, produced an astonishing flicked volley to seemingly rescue a point for Marco Silva’s side.</p><p>In truth, it would have been a travesty if Brentford, ahead through a brutal strike from Vitaly Janelt midway through the second half, had won this west London derby. Thomas Frank’s side had barely played any football. They sat deep and took every opportunity to indulge in a spot of gamesmanship.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/04/fulham-brentford-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The former England captain on the quest for parity, struggling under Sarina Wiegman, and her husband’s battle with MND</p><p>“There were times when I thought: ‘I&nbsp;don’t want to do this any more,’” Steph Houghton says as she remembers the hard years when she led the struggle to gain some parity for women in the unequal world of English football. Houghton won 121 caps for England, and captained her country from 2014 to 2021, but her most significant achievements happened far from the pitch. She worked closely with a small group of fellow players and went into battle with male executives, managers, administrators and sponsors who showed an often demeaning attitude towards women’s football.</p><p>The 36-year-old Houghton looks up, her gaze full of the fire and frustration she felt when it was difficult to make a lasting breakthrough. “I’d come in from training, having sacrificed time with my husband for a meeting, and take a call and feel deflated.

None of this is straightforward and some of today’s bondholders will probably also be tomorrow’s shareholders, assuming a debt-for-equity swap is possible. And “runway” is probably the wrong metaphor. We’re really talking about a sticking plaster before the main surgery on the balance s

<p>Concerns about US democracy grow with the electoral college’s role in enabling presidents to win without the popular vote, potentially benefiting Donald Trump in 2024</p><p>The last two presidential elections have raised serious questions about the strength of American democracy and, unfortunately, Tuesday’s election may deepen these concerns. Central to this issue is the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/01/election-electoral-college-votes-explained">electoral college</a>, which allows Americans to elect their president indirectly through state-appointed electors.

It would be gut-wrenching to see the unhinged, vengeful and power-hungry Mr Trump win because of the electoral college’s antidemocratic result.</p><p>Yet that might happen. Pos

<p>From Valencia’s floods to Prince William’s rents, any reminder of the gap between the haves and the have-nots can wipe out centuries of deference</p><p>There was something so incongruous about the sight of King Felipe of Spain, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/03/residents-throw-mud-and-insults-at-spanish-king-on-visit-to-flood-hit-town">mud-splattered</a> by raging elements of a crowd in Paiporta, a suburb of Valencia. It’s a timeless royal tradition, to take a walkabout through a fresh disaster. It’s meant to show empathy and leadership, and ideally something even more profound: a togetherness of nationhood that transcends any gulf of status. It’s meant to be healing.</p><p>It does, however, require from the public a hell of a lot of deference, to overlook certain things: for instance, that your home is destroyed, you have no food or nappies, and this guy in his pristine shirt and cargo pants will shortly get back in his SUV and go home to his dry and exquisit

## Ida Lupino: the fearless Hollywood star who overcame typecasting

<p>New Criterion series highlights the work of the actor and director who delivered powerful, provocative performances</p><p>When Ida Lupino starred opposite Humphrey Bogart in Raoul Walsh’s gritty film noir High Sierra, it was her name, not Bogie’s, at the top of the poster. This nail-biting movie with its terrific mountainside climax is about a released convict forced back into another heist, and the taxi dancer he can’t shake off. Lupino plays the dancer, a woman longing for an exit strategy from her tawdry world, and she transforms the role into something more than a type, with an unexpectedly authentic air of desperation. The film made household names out of both its leads, but for Lupino, as for Bogart, there was no such thing as overnight success.</p><p>Lupino’s own breakthrough came after seven years in Hollywood and a lifetime in showbusiness. She always refused the easy option and fought hard for her wins. Hedda Hopper neatly said Lupino had made her career out of combining

<p>Paula Varjack’s theatre show Nine Sixteenths looks back at the 2004 Super Bowl ‘Nipplegate’ controversy and what it reveals about the pressures on black women in the public eye</p><p>It has been just over two decades since Justin Timberlake ripped off a piece of Janet Jackson’s bustier at the 2004 Super Bowl half-time show – an incident that saw her right breast briefly exposed to 70,000 in-person spectators and more than 140 million TV viewers in what became known as “Nipplegate”. Despite both singers chalking the moment up to a “wardrobe malfunction”, it sparked international outrage and left Jackson, then 37, blacklisted from a significant portion of the music industry for years. In contrast, 23-year-old Timberlake (having just left the boyband ’NSync) went on to thrive as a solo artist.</p><p>The role that race, age and gender played in the aftermath is the inspiration for US-born theatre-maker and performer Paula Varjack’s new play, Nine Sixteenths.

<p>Arsenal’s Emily Fox stands out at United despite tricky buildup and Nikita Parris plays her part as Brighton go third</p><p>The Arsenal right-back Emily Foxy defied her busier-than-usual international window to play a key role in their 1-1 draw at Manchester United. Fox was involved in all three of the United States’ games between 25 and 30 October, including playing the final half an hour of their 3-0 victory over Argentina on Wednesday in Louisville, Kentucky. It is understood that the 26-year-old’s flight home did not land until late on Friday afternoon, yet she was at her typically energetic best on Sunday. She played the full 90 minutes and crucially made a bursting run into the penalty area to unlock Manchester United’s defence and provide the assist for Alessia Russo’s opening goal.

<p>Paul Reiser and Colm Meaney go into cliche mode when an Irish patriarch wills half his legacy to his son’s unknown American cousin</p><p>Never mind people. The problem with this comedy is the cliches. It could not be more Irish if it was dropped into a pint of Guinness and rolled in shamrocks by a dancing leprechaun. The script is co-written by the American actor Paul Reiser, with a very broad sense of humour, though it’s likable enough. Colm Meaney is also on decent form as undertaker Ciáran, whose elderly father Fergus (Des Keogh) has a deathbed request: he wants to heal a rift with the American side of the family that has rumbled on for a couple of generations.</p><p>Over in New York, Reiser plays American cousin Barry, a real-estate tycoon. He’s recovering from the double whammy of a heart attack and divorce, which puts him in the sentimental mood for a family reunion. So off he flies, back to the old country. Initially, Barry is charmed by the beauty of the landscape and the

<p>I used to joke that in my divorce settlement my ex got the house and I got the cat. I still think mine was the better deal</p><p>Two summers ago, on a warm afternoon, I walked through the streets of north London, carrying my cat. Dollface was 17 years old, and had been diagnosed with kidney disease. It was severe and late-stage, and there was nothing to be done. The previous night we had lain together on my living room floor while I fed her painkillers and small pieces of prawn. And then it was dawn, and we rose to meet the terrible day.</p><p>A Covid spike meant a home visit from the vet was not possible, and Doll hated buses and car journeys, so I had decided that the best way to reach the surgery was on foot. Our mission was at odds with the beauty of the day, but I was glad she got to say goodbye to the world like this: so verdant and fragrant and alive. I wanted her to take it with her, wherever she might go.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/nov/04/t

<p>There is a ritual of withholding all criticism when someone from an ethnic minority takes a position of power. That ritual has now become farce</p><p>So here we are. Kemi Badenoch is the leader of the Conservative party. That’s another couple of firsts that the Tories have beaten Labour to. So far, the Conservatives have elected the first Asian leader and prime minister, and the first female Black leader of any major British political party.</p><p>But as these firsts started to come quicker and closer together – we now have a brown party leader handing over to a Black one – two things have happened. One, the politics of the party has become more unhinged and its electoral record has tanked. And two, the profile of these mould-breaking new leaders has become more extreme. The two are not unrelated to the success of ethnic minorities in the Tory party. I am sorry to point this out, because there is a sort of ritual now that must be observed when the Tories do well on diversity: you
