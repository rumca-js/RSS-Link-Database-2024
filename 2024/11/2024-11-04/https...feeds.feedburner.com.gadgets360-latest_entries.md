Recent analysis of images captured by NASA's Voyager 2 has suggested that Miranda, a moon orbiting Uranus, may have once contained a significant ocean beneath its icy exterior. Research led by Tom Nordheim at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory reveals that this ocean could have existed hundreds of millions of years ago, driven by tidal forces from interactions with nearby moons. This discovery opens up new avenues for understanding the icy bodies within our solar system, highlighting the importance of further exploration to confirm these findings.
