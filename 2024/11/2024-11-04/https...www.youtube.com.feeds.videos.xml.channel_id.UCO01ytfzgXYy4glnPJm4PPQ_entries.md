Today on the Matt Walsh Show, with one day to go until the election, I will present my own closing argument for Donald Trump. Also, bombshell revelations in the Daniel Penny trial only make it more clear that charges never should have been brought. Arizona's attorney general is investigating Trump for criticizing Liz Cheney—just more lawfare being used by the Democrats, who are the only ones who ever use it. Joe Biden fantasizes about inappropriately touching Donald Trump. And the country comes together to mourn the loss of a squirrel named P’Nut.
