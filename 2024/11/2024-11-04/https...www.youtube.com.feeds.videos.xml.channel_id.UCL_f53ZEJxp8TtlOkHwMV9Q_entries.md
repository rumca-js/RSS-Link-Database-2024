Dr. Jordan B. Peterson sits down with journalist and best-selling author Miranda Devine. They discuss her latest book, “The Big Guy,” which sheds new light on the darkest depths of the Biden family’s corruption. Ukraine ties, China distractions, Russian misinformation hoaxes, and the true net worth of Joe — it’s all in this episode.

Miranda Devine is an Australian radio host, columnist, and writer who now lives in New York. She has written for the Sydney Morning Herald, the Sun-Herald, the Daily Telegraph, Sunday Telegraph, the Sunday Herald Sun, the Sunday Times, and the New York Times. Her 2021 publication, “Laptop from Hell: Hunter Biden, Big Tech, and the Dirty Secrets the President Tried to Hide,” details who Hunter Biden is, his drug addiction, his supposed dealings with his father both when he was vice president and now, and their manipulation of the establishment media to censor dissidents and suppress the opposition.
