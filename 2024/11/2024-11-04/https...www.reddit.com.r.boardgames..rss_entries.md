<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am researching opening of a board game cafe and would love to hear about your experiences playing in these spaces. Both positive and negative. What places have gotten it right and why? What makes for an inviting board game space? How have these spaces dealt with the table turnover issue (paying by the hour or minimum charges, versus a free for all)? Do you think these spaces need thousands of games or can they target their games into more theme nights, leagues, etc? Should they target hard core gamers or casual gamers or both? How have the best and worst spaces dealt with this?</p> <p>Any thoughts and ideas would be very much appreciated!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/zampana"> /u/zampana </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1gjrw5k/ideas_from_the_best_board_game_cafes/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1gjrw

Instead of randomly receiving mana you choose each turn which card to recycle (or not to recycle) for +1 mana income. A much more balanced and interesting way.</p> <p>+ Songs (for example, a character with Song 3 can sing a spell cards-songs with cost 3 for free) are fun and thematic mechanics</p> <p>+ You can only fight enemy characters only if they are tapped. So you always have a choice: attack or quest with your characters (scoring victory points), risking their lifes, or stay safe and keep them alive</p> <p>+ Beautiful design, gorgeous art. Though sometimes you come across so-so illustrations.</p> <p>Unfortunately Lorcana also has huge flaws:</p> <p>- Almost all card abilities are primitive.

Sometimes these rules income permanently modifying the board, but not always. Sometimes these rules involve extra pieces, but not always or those pieces could be fungible. So there&#39;s nothing to prevent someone from coming up with a set of homebrew campaign modes for literally any game.</p> <p>Is this a thing that people do? Is there a subreddit I can join or a BGG thread?</p> <p>I think it would be cool to try some and maybe even make some of my own.

## Game with superpower cards, a scenario, and choosing which hero will save the day.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all! I played a board game a few years ago that was pretty entertaining but I forgot the name of it! Players were dealt a few cards with various words and phrases. One player was the &quot;victim&quot; that needed saving and there was some silly scenario put forth. Each player in turn would pick one of their cards to present with a story about how they&#39;re the ideal hero to save the victim in that scenario. After everyone had pitched their ideas, the victim picks which hero saves them.</p> <p>I&#39;ve searched and searched and searched on Google and on BoardGameGeek looking for this game. I&#39;ve used categories like party games, and game mechanics like acting and storytelling. It seems very similar to Snake Oil in terms of pitching some BS to be picked, or like Superfight except the ridiculous powers are to address a posed scenario rather than how my dad can beat up your dad type stuff. Does anyone know what game I&#39;m talking about? Thanks

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>What&#39;s the most thematic game you&#39;ve been playing recently?</p> <p>Through the Ice and Snow is going for a very thematic experience. It&#39;s an expedition based worker placement, set collection, semi coop game. Semi coop meaning you sort of both control your path of one ship, competitive that you have your own routes you&#39;re targeting along with goals. The worker placement is based on specialty captain plus worker, scientist with or without worker.....Also there&#39;s a randomized board you build as you go along which is pretty interesting for marking territories.</p> <p>While I&#39;m not sure this is a game that will be loved at high player counts, I need to test this beyond 2 player. Very interesting hunger mechanic. They literally have a &quot;vow of silence&quot; action...hopefully you know why.</p> <p>Sharing resources for actions sometimes seems off, but you&#39;re on the same destination and they give you points for doing it.</p> <

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all, </p> <p>I played a game called Fictions: Memoir of a Gangster: <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/378731/fictions-memoirs-of-a-gangster">https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/378731/fictions-memoirs-of-a-gangster</a> and the rules sound so familiar. The idea is that you play cards to complete missions and hire higher-level cards, so you can roll more dice and try to not get caught. Cards have a fingerprint icon on them their evidence and having to play multiple chapters, seems so familiar. Like I have played this game before. The first scenario Hands up, is what feels very familiar. The rest of the game scenarios don&#39;t have the same feeling. But the mechanics of the game and even the art style of the old 1940s/1950s gangsters and actors just give a huge feeling of Deja Vu. I can picture myself playing similar games years ago. Does anyone know of a similar game? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://ww

Can you give me a hint what type of game it can be?
