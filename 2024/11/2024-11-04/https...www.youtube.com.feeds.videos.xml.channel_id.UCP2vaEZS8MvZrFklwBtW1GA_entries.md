How to apply silicone against bathtubs…I cut the applicator tip to be the same size as the joint. After I apply the silicone I lightly spray it with soapy water. Then I use the DAP caulking tool with lots of pressure to make the joint super tight 👍🏽🔥#caulking #showerremodel #bathroomremodel #homerenovation
