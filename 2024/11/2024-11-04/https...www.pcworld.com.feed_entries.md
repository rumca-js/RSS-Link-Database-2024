<p>PDF files have become a major part of our digital lives in this cross-platform world. While simply viewing or commenting on a PDF can be accomplished with free software, there are times when we need to engage with a PDF more extensively, making edits or reorganizing a file. That’s where a PDF editor comes in.</p>



<p>The best PDF editors allows you to edit, create, alter, and convert PDF files just like you would with any other text document. Adobe Acrobat is the most famous option for most people. But while it’s excellent both in features and utility, it’s also pretty expensive. </p>



<p>Thankfully, in recent years a whole host of third-party PDF editors have sprung up in order to provide less expensive alternatives. (If you’re wondering why <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2191006/why-doesnt-windows-have-a-decent-pdf-editor.html" data-type="

<p>Last week, Microsoft issued a warning that a network of bots (or botnet) is being actively used to carry out advanced password-spraying attacks against users of Microsoft’s Azure cloud computing service. The worst part? It’s been going on for over a year.</p>



<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/11/microsoft-warns-of-8000-strong-botnet-used-in-password-spraying-attacks/">reported by Ars Technica</a>, hackers working for the Chinese government used a botnet — consisting mainly of TP-Link routers, with over 16,000 compromised devices, from around the world — to carry out attacks that hijacked Microsoft Azure accounts. </p>

<p>The 2-in-1 laptop is a great idea. Why not get a machine that’s both a laptop <em>and</em> a tablet, able to switch between modes as needed? After all, they do a lot of the same things. Why waste money on a separate laptop and tablet just to juggle them?</p>



<p>And, honestly, 2-in-1 laptops <em>are</em> great. But greatness isn’t always a given. There are caveats and pitfalls you need to avoid, nuances and inconveniences that may not be readily apparent — like the fact that 2-in-1 laptops actually come in two forms: the detachable tablet-laptop and the ultra-flexible laptop with a 360-degree hinge.</p>



<p>There are many aspects that can make a 2-in-1 worse than its traditional clamshell counterpart, and there are plenty of ways these machines might not meet your expectations. Detachable tablets can act <em>like</em> laptops, but they <em>aren’t</em>
