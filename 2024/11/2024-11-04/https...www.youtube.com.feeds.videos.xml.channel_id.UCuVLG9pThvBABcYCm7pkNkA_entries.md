One last time, join Rollie Williams and Nicole Conlan (The Daily Show, The Climate Denier's Playbook) in an hour of swing state voter outreach as we text our exes (and uncles, and old college roommates) who live in key voter swing states and ask them nicely what their voting plan is. Just trying to prevent the very preventable problem of someone intending to vote who doesn't get around to it because they didn't have a plan. We'll be walking through a Climate Changemakers outreach playbook (https://www.climatechangemakers.org/action-mobilize-voters-you-know) which includes:
1) identifying people in our personal networks who are residents of 8 key swing states (Arizona, Michigan, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Georgia, North Carolina, and Wisconsin)
2) Drafting texts, emails, and passionate voicemails encouraging them to make a voting plan,
3) Sliding into those sweet DMS.
