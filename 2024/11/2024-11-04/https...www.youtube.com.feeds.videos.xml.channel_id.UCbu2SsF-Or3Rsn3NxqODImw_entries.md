Treyarch's latest entry into the Call of Duty series uses creative mission design and its new omni-movement system to tell a fun but sometimes nonsensical story.

The spirit of Black Ops 2 is alive in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6. It infuses the standard Call of Duty formula with level designs and mission ideas that challenge the usual framework in much the same way. It's not as brazen as Black Ops 2 was--that game was admirable for going all-out, but not all of its ideas were home runs in execution--and there's no branching narrative or major departures from Call of Duty gameplay in Black Ops 6. Instead, Treyarch works in creative but familiar design additions that break up its campaign, making for an experience that maintains the franchise's cinematic, high-yield explosiveness, while also providing numerous opportunities to feel like a super spy and super soldier.
