<p>Anfield will forever celebrate their hero of Istanbul but the Leverkusen head coach returns with a new fairytale to write</p><p>Xabi Alonso took centre stage at Anfield elegantly, considered his options and switched play in an instant. Had the ball been at his feet it would have felt as if he had never been away, but it was on the subject of succeeding Jürgen Klopp as Liverpool manager where the club’s former midfielder showed the deftest of touches.</p><p>Alonso was back with Bayer Leverkusen, Liverpool’s opponent in the Champions League on Tuesday night, 15 years after ending a playing chapter in his career synonymous with style, Istanbul and an intuitive rapport with Steven Gerrard. He could have been back sooner had Liverpool received any encouragement he might have been in the market for a new job this summer. It was not a possibility he entertained at the time or was keen to revisit at his pre-match press conference on Monday.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/footbal

<p>Adapted from Juan Rulfo’s inflential novel, Rodrigo Prieto’s fractured drama of a son’s return home is confusing but powerful</p><p>Here is a new adaptation of Juan Rulfo’s 1955 magic-realist novel that later inspired Gabriel García Márquez, among others; judging by the non-linear tangle of life and death, lost loves and shattered ideals, you wonder if it wasn’t also an influence on the fractured films of the 00s Mexican new wave written by Guillermo Arriaga. With Amores Perros cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto serving as director here, this fragmentation is at first a tough introduction to the story’s teeming ghost town, then thrilling, then finally a problem.</p><p>Juan Preciado (Tenoch Huerta) has made a promise to his mother on her deathbed: that he will return to the fateful <em>pueblo</em> of Camala to finally meet his father Pedro Páramo. But who is Páramo? “A living resentment,” says the first wayfarer Juan encounters, before directing him to lodge with local innkeeper Eduvig

Swedish novelist Stieg Larsson died of a sudden heart attack 20 years ago this week, aged only 50, before the publication of The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo and the Millennium trilogy that followed.</p><p>What is less well known is that on the day of his death (9 November 2004), Larsson was due to give a lecture on<em> </em>the Nazis’ November pogrom at the headquarters of the Workers’ Educational Association in Stockholm. Kristallnacht,<em> </em>“the night of broken glass”, was an important date in Larsson’s calendar, which he commemorated every year.

<p>As the US prepares to vote for a new president, a look back at the difficulties Hollywood election films have faced</p><p>The US presidential election takes up an enormous amount of space in the news cycle; even a reset and abbreviated race, like the one between late-breaking candidate Kamala Harris and eternal rerun Donald Trump, starts to feel downright eternal in the final sprint. It’s an event that dominates the media for the better part of every fourth year in the calendar (and a not-inconsiderable part of the other three), not without good reason: these races have been enormously consequential, as are many of the down-ballot races squeezed out of as much attention. Yet this urgency is not something often well-captured in movies about US elections, which frequently fall somewhere between flop-sweaty dramatic earnestness or toothless comedic mildness.</p><p>Maybe contemporary films can’t compete with the breathlessness of modern campaign coverage – and they may not want to suc

<p>As 26 American states mark driest October on record, South Africa hit by heatwave with temperatures reaching 42.6C</p><p>Across the US, a combination of weeks of dry conditions and record-breaking temperatures has led to the emergence of “flash droughts”. A persistent area of high pressure over North America has limited rainfall across much of the country, with 100 weather stations across 26 states marking their driest October on record. This is despite high rainfall totals from Hurricanes Helene and Milton across south-eastern states in late September and early October. In the southern Appalachians, where Helene dropped nearly 800mm of rain, some weather stations have since reported no measurable precipitation. As of 28 October, data indicates that an eighth of the US experienced zero rainfall that month, affecting major cities such as New York, Houston, and San Francisco.</p><p>Compounding the situation, high temperatures across the US have further stressed already parched lands

<p>The Detroit Lions look like a complete team this season. And their quarterback has risen to become one of the best at his profession</p><p>The Detroit Lions are the best team in the NFL. They walked into a stormy Lambeau Field on Sunday and did what legitimate contenders do: handled their business against a talented yet inconsistent opponent, <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/boxscore/_/gameId/401671767">winning 24-14 on the road</a> against the Packers.</p><p>There is plenty of credit to go around. Dan Campbell’s culture. The aggressive fourth-down calls. A pass rush that is still sizzling despite losing Aidan Hutchinson for the season. The team’s versatile secondary. The “<a href="https://www.si.com/nfl/lions/news/sonic-and-knuckles-emerge-in-lions-offense">Sonic and Knuckles</a>” running back duo. Ben Johnson’s creative play-calling. The best offensive line in the NFL. But it’s time to recognize the person who makes it all tick: Jared Goff.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.

<p>Forest and Bournemouth shine again, Gordon provides Tyneside tonic, while Gomez and Solanke are winning over doubters</p><p>If Ruud van Nistelrooy was supposed to wash the nostalgia out of the Manchester United system then perhaps that was achieved, though maybe not as intended. If Rúben Amorim was distracted from preparing Sporting for Manchester City on Tuesday, he will be more aware of a United squad bereft of confidence. United’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/03/vampirism-meets-overspend-to-make-death-football-of-late-stage-capitalism">first 60 minutes against Chelsea</a> saw them fumble pathetically for creativity. Not even the presence of one of the club’s greatest strikers has lifted the finishing quality in a group low on goals. Alejandro Garnacho and Marcus Rashford were both bereft of touch and instinct; substitute Joshua Zirkzee’s signing remains a mystery. There was something of Van Nistelrooy in Rasmus Højlund winning Bruno Fernandes’s penalty

<p>The author employs his pitch-perfect repertoire of satirical skills in his first book for five years – a novella about the residents of an upmarket care home during the pandemic</p><p>Alan Bennett, now 90, hasn’t published anything original in book form for five years. In the meantime – the Covid years and the Johnson years and the Truss month – readers have had to be content with the peerless annual diaries he writes <a href="https://www.lrb.co.uk/contributors/alan-bennett">for the </a><em><a href="https://www.lrb.co.uk/contributors/alan-bennett">London Review of Books</a></em>, yearly proof that his special ear for English comedy and sudden pathos is undimmed. This novella is in part his reflection on those years, set inevitably in a care home, the unlikely frontline of national crisis during the pandemic.</p><p>Bennett, of course, knows his way around those institutional corridors. He inhabited them in perhaps the most memorable episode of his <em>Talking Heads</em> series, Tho

<p>Long hospital waiting lists, extortionate food bills and rising homelessness. Welcome to life under the most rightwing Finnish government in generations</p><p>Oulu is five hours north from Helsinki by train and a good deal colder and darker each winter than the Finnish capital. From November to March its 220,000 residents are lucky to see daylight for a couple of hours a day and temperatures can reach the minus 30s. However, this is not the reason I sense a darkening of the Finnish dream that brought me here six years ago.</p><p>In 2018, moving to Finland seemed like a no-brainer. One year earlier I had met my Finnish partner while working away in Oulu. My adopted home of Italy, where I had lived for 10 years, had recently elected a coalition government with the far-right Matteo Salvini as interior minister, while my native UK had voted for Brexit. Given Finland’s status as a beacon of progressive values, I boarded a plane, leaving my lecturing job and friends behind.</p><p>Mike W

<p>What would happen if our arts critics and sports writers swapped roles for a day? How does the English National Opera compare to the Premier League … or the NFL to a West End musical? Our experts found out last week</p><p>Plenty unites the Guardian’s sports reporters and cultural critics. Both make a living observing the apex of physicality. They have to make sense of what they’ve seen at lightning speed to meet deadlines. So why not swap gigs for the day? The sports team were delighted to be working in warm venues; the critics unabashed about their disregard for the rules of the game. But more importantly, genuinely striking insights ensued, whether about Elton John’s appearance at Dua Lipa’s gig being the equivalent of Aston Villa making a Hail Mary sub of Jhon Durán, or the rugby ball being like a black hole sucking the players into its orbit. Perhaps we need to open transfer season between desks more often. <em>Laura Snapes</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture

<p>The Conservative party has elected a new leader – one with a combative reputation. Isabel Hardman reports</p><p>After almost four months, the Conservatives have finally elected a new leader – their sixth in nine years. Kemi Badenoch, a former software engineer who prides herself on “straight-talking”, said it was an “enormous honour to lead the party I love”. But the party she joined in her 20s was very different to the one she leads today, left with just 121 MPs after a historic defeat and an ageing membership. Yet Badenoch insists she can make the party win again – by the next election.</p><p>The Spectator columnist <strong>Isabel Hardman</strong> explains how Badenoch’s background has shaped her principles. From a childhood in Nigeria to university in the UK to working at the Spectator where, Hardman says, it was clear she was someone who had “huge ambition” and “clearly felt [she] had a lot to offer national politics”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2024/n
