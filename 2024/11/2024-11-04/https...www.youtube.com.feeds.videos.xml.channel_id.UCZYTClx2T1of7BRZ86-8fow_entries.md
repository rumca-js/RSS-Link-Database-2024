Félicette's pin is currently lost in space! She will be available for purchase very soon. In the meantime, check out a mystery dip of our past space pins here: https://complexly.store/products/scishow-mystery-enamel-pin

In the history of space travel, there are a few famous animal astronauts (or cosmonauts), like Laika the dog and Ham the chimpanzee. But you might not have heard of Félicette, who in 1963 became the first -- and so far only -- cat to go to space.
