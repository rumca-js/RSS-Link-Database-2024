<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>It could be due to anything: An art style that was headache-inducing or overwhelming, incest stuff, squeamishness-inducing violence, other uncomfortable themes or visual gags, etc.</p> <p>I was inspired to make this thread because, although I am going to press forward with it due to the show&#39;s classic status and alluring uniqueness (especially visually), I was THIS CLOSE to dropping Bakemonogatari, which I&#39;m just now watching for the first time, because of [Bakemonogatari spoilers] <span class="md-spoiler-text">the 11-year-old ghost-girl being a target of boob-grope and panty-shot gags, which made me cringe HAAARD even though the MC basically acknowledged some of those moments with the character as being immoral.</span> I also had to pass on watching any more seasons of Komi Can&#39;t Communicate past the 1st (which I&#39;ve talked about on this reddit before) because of the yandere&#39;s rapey tendencies and overall insufferable disposition.

It was some sort of anime idk if it was Chinese Korean or Japanese. The main character is a girl with semi long brown hair i believe in a high ponytail and glasses. She wore pants and a shirt. the first episode she mentions she does the splits randomly and shot has her doing a split in the store with her feet on the shelves. Cause apparently she&#39;s a ballerina. Her rival is a girl with long black hair i think also in a pony tail. The rival is apparently possessed by some sort of i guess puppet demon that makes her better at ballet. Somehow it ends up where we meet this older man and this younger kid with a bowl cut having to fight the demon. It ends up being a adventure type i guess of expelling different puppet demons</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/u

So I’ve been recommending him anime shows for a few months now that have good fantasy stories (which is his favourite genre) such as Frieren and eminence in shadow. He told me he liked them, so I recently recommended him Akame ga Kill which seemed right up his alley. </p> <p>A few hours later he told me he was on episode 17 which surprised me how quick he was binging through it so I assumed he was enjoying it. Eventually, I heard the final episode playing on his tv outside his room so I decided to listen in on his reaction to the ending. Only for me catch hi

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I remember watching it as a kid and from the design i believe it is a really old one. It is an educational anime. It has three main characters: two boys whose name i can&#39;t remember, one is wearing green and the other is wearing yellow and the third character is a girl named Jenny/Jennie wearing pink. The green boy is depicted as careless and the yellow boy is depicted as the most intelligent of them all. I got to watch three episodes back then: one is about animal cloning, one is about why objects weigh less in space, and the last one is about the many shapes of animal tongues.
