								<p>The <strong>Warhammer 40k primarchs</strong> are immensely powerful Space Marine generals in Games Workshop's grim, dark Warhammer 40,000 sci-fi wargame universe, and their actions have driven some of the biggest story events to shaped the setting - from the ancient Horus Heresy to current 40k lore. Read on to meet all 20 (or perhaps 18), and find out where they each ended up.</p>

								<p>A new special character joins the Dwarfen Mountain Holds for <strong>Warhammer the Old World</strong>: Burlok Damminson, engineer, inventor, and radical. Though rules for Burlok appeared in the Dwarfs’ Arcane Journal that was released this summer, his miniature is showing up late - ironic, as Damminson is usually to be found at the forefront of any Dwarven expedition, the better to test his new and experimental war machines.</p>

								<p>The <strong>Magic: The Gathering card</strong> Blade of the Bloodchief has shot up in price, boosted by synergy with the new Jumpstart reveals and a Modern combo deck that’s filled with Eldrazi. Two weeks ago, on October 21, the card cost just $4.80, but now it’s risen by 208% to $14.83, according to MTG Goldfish’s price tracker.</p>

								<p>‘Life-Size DnD’ is a roleplaying experience that lives somewhere between the worlds of LARP and tabletop <b>Dungeons and Dragons</b>. You can physically act out your fantasy adventures as in LARP, but you must obey the movement rules and dice rolls of a D&amp;D-inspired system. I had a chance to try Life-Size DnD at this year’s MCM London Comic Con, and if you thought regular D&amp;D was chaotic, you haven’t seen anything yet.</p>
