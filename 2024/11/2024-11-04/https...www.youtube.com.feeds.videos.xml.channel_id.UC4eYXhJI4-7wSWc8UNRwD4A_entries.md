Vocalist Koshi Inaba is well known as the vocalist and lyricist  for the massively popular Japanese rock duo B’z. But he’s also recorded several solo albums, including this year’s Tadamono, his first in 10 years. Back in September, he stopped by the Tiny Desk in Japan to perform some of his new music.
"I've performed live in many places up until now, but this was the first time I've performed live in an office with people working next to me,” Inaba said during the rehearsal for this show. “No matter how many years you've been doing it, there are always firsts!"
With special arrangements designed just for this performance, Inaba captures the Tiny Desk spirit in this session recorded live in Tokyo at the NHK (aka the Japan Broadcasting Corporation). Tiny Desk Japan is the latest addition to the global TV series version of the beloved Tiny Desk Concert series.
