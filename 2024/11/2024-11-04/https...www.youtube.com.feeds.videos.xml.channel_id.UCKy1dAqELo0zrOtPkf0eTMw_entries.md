## Mario & Luigi: Brothership Review

Mario & Luigi: Brothership reviewed by Logan Plant on Nintendo Switch.

Mario & Luigi: Brothership is a disappointing return for an RPG series I love. Apart from the combat, it fundamentally misunderstands its own past success, and completely fumbles Luigi’s role in puzzle-solving and exploration by making him more of a pain than a partner. The story is simplistic and unoriginal, its attempts at humor fall flat, and the overly chatty writing holds your hand to a ridiculous degree. It’s not a total disaster, as the flashy turn-based battles are some of the best this series has had – but even those somehow manage to wear thin as the repetitive final act crawls across the finish line of this roughly 34-hour campaign, which suffers from surprisingly bad performance issues nearly the entire time. The Switch has been home to many triumphant revivals for Nintendo, but the Mario & Luigi series has sadly missed the boat.

## Slitterhead Review

Slitterhead reviewed by Tristan Ogilvie on PlayStation 5. Also available on PlayStation 4, PC, and Xbox Series X|S.

"Slitterhead features some interesting body-swapping exploration and a unique blood-based battle system, but it never fully capitalises on either of them due to its small handful of repeated level settings and largely indistinguishable enemy encounters. Its story is disappointingly primitive in its presentation, and its time-looping structure only really serves as a feeble attempt to mask the fact that it takes about one hour’s worth of story mission ideas and repeats them incessantly across its 13-hour duration. Like a bloody blade worn down by a few too many battles, Slitterhead grows increasingly dull over time and ultimately just doesn’t cut it."
