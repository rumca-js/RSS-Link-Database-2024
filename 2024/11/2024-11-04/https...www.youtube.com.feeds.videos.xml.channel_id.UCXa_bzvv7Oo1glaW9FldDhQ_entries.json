No, not Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition. We're talking about last year's Red Dead Redemption, a port of the 2010 open-world classic for PS4 and Nintendo Switch.\n\nThe lack of quality-of-life features, meagre graphical improvements, and removal of online content, all for $50, made it a challenging recommendation. It's now available on PC, and with the help of Double Eleven, Rockstar has stepped up in terms of graphics options, including native 4K, higher high frame rates, shadow details, and more.\n\nUnfortunately, it's also for $50. While it's somewhat of an improvement over last year's console re-release, Red Dead Redemption on PC is best purchased at a discount. The story, presentation, characters, and world design remain as incredible as ever, which makes it all the more disappointing to see them in such a barebones fashion.", "id": 1452784, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aa4hGFGlJKU", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 129, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/aa4hGFGlJKU/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Red Dead Redemption PC Review - The Final Verdict", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-11-04T18:30:44+00:00", "description": "Back when S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Call of Pripyat released, few of us could have predicted that there wouldn\u2019t be another S.T.A.L.K.E.R. game for the next decade and a half, but after a long hiatus, the franchise is finally set to return to the limelight.
