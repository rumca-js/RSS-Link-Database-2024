<img src="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/5Pro-Site.jpg?width=1920&height=1920&fit=bounds&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp" /> <p>The first part of the PlayStation 5 Pro embargo lifts today, meaning that we can show - on camera! - a console being taken out of its packaging! It's a box that may prove similar to owners of the existing PlayStation 5, as it's essentially packaged in the same way: an easily tearable outer layer gives way to a sturdier white cardboard box with a main compartment for the console itself and a secondary area for power cable, horizontal stand pieces, HDMI and USB-C to USB-C cables and a dual sense controller. So far, no surprises.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-playstation-5-pro-weve-removed-it-from-its-box-and-theres-new-information-to-share">Read more</a></p>

## Slitterhead review - singular and unapologetically strange

<img src="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Slit_3.jpg?width=1920&height=1920&fit=bounds&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp" /> <p>I love Slitterhead. I love it despite the fact there's a lot about Slitterhead I don't like very much. A little like that lad you went to school with that you barely liked then and like even less now in adulthood, Slitterhead is crass and seedy and pretty gross. Your other half keeps asking why you don't just ghost him if he's that bad, but the truth is, <em>you're</em> kinda crass, seedy and pretty gross, too. He just brings it out in you, the same as Bokeh Game Studios apparently brings this out in me.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/slitterhead-review">Read more</a></p>
