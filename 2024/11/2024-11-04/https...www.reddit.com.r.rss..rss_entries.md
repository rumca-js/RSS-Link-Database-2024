<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Are there any popular RSS readers (say, Feedly, Inoreader, NewsBlur) that explicitly either do or do not collect and sell or otherwise use my personal data and interaction history - for example, to show me targeted ads? I&#39;ve waded through privacy policies and other information and it&#39;s still hazy to me.</p> <p>I&#39;m trying to move away from social media, for both privacy and &quot;algorithm&quot; concerns, intending to more proactively seek out information rather than having it curated for me.</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/chriswei2k"> /u/chriswei2k </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1gjooum/rss_reader_privacy/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1gjooum/rss_reader_privacy/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I woke up during the night suddenly aware and afraid I may get sued for using an RSS Aggregator product and displaying the results on my website. All credits are visible on posts and youtube videos as well as FB and other social media channels and clicking the article takes the reader back to the original. The product creator quoted this to me &quot; <strong>As mentioned , the content that gets aggregated is only from public sources, so up to a certain point you have the right to aggregate the content.&quot;</strong> The product I have subscribed to provides widgets base on my search, then I place the short code into the Wordpress website. Putting myself in the position of some of the FB posts which are in their thousands, I&#39;m not sure I would be happy to see them on some elses website . Anyone doing the same thing with the same fears? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/UnlikelyPurple1825"> /u/
