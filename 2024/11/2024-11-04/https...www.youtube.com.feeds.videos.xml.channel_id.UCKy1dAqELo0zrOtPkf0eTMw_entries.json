Apart from the combat, it fundamentally misunderstands its own past success, and completely fumbles Luigi\u2019s role in puzzle-solving and exploration by making him more of a pain than a partner. The story is simplistic and unoriginal, its attempts at humor fall flat, and the overly chatty writing holds your hand to a ridiculous degree. It\u2019s not a total disaster, as the flashy turn-based battles are some of the best this series has had \u2013 but even those somehow manage to wear thin as the repetitive final act crawls across the finish line of this roughly 34-hour campaign, which suffers from surprisingly bad performance issues nearly the entire time.
