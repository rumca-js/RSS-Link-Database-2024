I only see that my Docker VM is using 90% of the processor load, but not how that is divided between the containers. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Hatchopper\"> /u/Hatchopper </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1gjd047/container_resource_monitoring_and_insights/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1gjd047/container_resource_monitoring_and_insights/\">[comments]</a", "id": 1449422, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1gjd047/container_resource_monitoring_and_insights", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 450, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Container resource monitoring and insights", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-11-04T11:39:29+00:00", "description": "<table> <tr><td> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1gjc70b/selfhosting_my_blog_on_a_10_year_old_raspberry_pi/\"> <img src=\"https://preview.redd.it/p15bdge8gvyd1.jpeg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3920ca80cff63d419358ebfad6f7991a3a53d186\" alt=\"Self-hosting my blog on a 10 year old raspberry pi\" title=\"Self-hosting my blog on a 10 year old raspberry pi\" /> </a> </td><td> <!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;ve self-hosted my blog on a raspberry pi with 174MiB ram and BCM2835 (1) @ 700MHz cpu, I&#39;ve covered it in a blog, Read_ it and tell me your reviews also, follow the blog and self host something yourself and share it with me.</p> <p><a href=\"https://blog.kanishkk.me/?action=view&amp;url=self-hosted-101\">https://blog.kanishkk.me/?action=view&amp;url=self-hosted-101</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/morpheus_jean\"> /u/morpheus_jean </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://i.redd.it/p15bdge8gvyd1.", "id": 1449075, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1gjc70b/selfhosting_my_blog_on_a_10_year_old_raspberry_pi", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 450, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://preview.redd.it/p15bdge8gvyd1.jpeg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=3920ca80cff63d419358ebfad6f7991a3a53d186", "title": "Self-hosting my blog on a 10 year old raspberry pi", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-11-04T11:19:01+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>hello, I decided to have a go at self hosting with jellyfin running in a docker container.

I have a Ubiquiti USG with my servers local IP forwarded over port 80. I have a URL set up with DuckDNS using my public IP. This setup has worked before, but after some tinkering today (removing an unnecessary router and replacing it with a real switch) it simply refuses to work. As stated in the title I can easily access this server through its local IP anywhere on my LAN, and through my public IP, both on and off LAN, but it fails to connect over the URL provided by DuckDNS, be it on or off LAN. The really odd thing is, sometimes when I change settings in the USG I&#39;ll be able to connect to the server both on and off LAN through the URL a few times before it becomes unreachable again. Any help at all is greatly appreciated.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Primo0077\"> /u/Primo0077 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"h", "id": 1447054, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1gj1fy3/can_access_webserver_through_local_ip_and_public", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 450, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Can access webserver through local IP and public IP both on and off network, but not through URL", "vote": 0}]
