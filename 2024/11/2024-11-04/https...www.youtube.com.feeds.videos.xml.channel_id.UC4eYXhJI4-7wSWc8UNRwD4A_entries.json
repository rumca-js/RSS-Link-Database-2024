But he\u2019s also recorded several solo albums, including this year\u2019s Tadamono, his first in 10 years. Back in September, he stopped by the Tiny Desk in Japan to perform some of his new music.\n\"I've performed live in many places up until now, but this was the first time I've performed live in an office with people working next to me,\u201d Inaba said during the rehearsal for this show. \u201cNo matter how many years you've been doing it, there are always firsts!\"\nWith special arrangements designed just for this performance, Inaba captures the Tiny Desk spirit in this session recorded live in Tokyo at the NHK (aka the Japan Broadcasting Corporation). Tiny Desk Japan is the latest addition to the global TV series version of the beloved Tiny Desk Concert series.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Who\u2019s To Blame For The Narcolepsy?\"\n\"Lips\"\n\"BLEED\"\n\"Black Hole\"\n\"YELLOW\"\n\"Wings\"\n\nM", "id": 1453543, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-ne87XKlY0", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 225, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/q-ne87XKlY0/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Koshi Inaba: Tiny Desk Japan", "vote": 0}]
