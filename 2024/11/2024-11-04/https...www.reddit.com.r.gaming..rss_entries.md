<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone! Back when I was a teenager, I used to spend a lot of time playing all sorts of RPGs. They were my absolute favorite genre, and I would pour hours into them. Now that I&#39;m an adult, most of my time goes into work, and I rarely get a chance to dive into games like I used to.</p> <p>However, Iâ€™ve got three weeks of vacation coming up, and Iâ€™m really looking to spend some time with a good RPG. Iâ€™d love any recommendations for RPGs with large open worlds, non-linear stories, and the freedom to explore and make choices. Ideally, Iâ€™d be able to finish it (or at least make good progress) within these three weeks.</p> <p>Thanks in advance for any suggestions!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Sailor_in_the_ocean_"> /u/Sailor_in_the_ocean_ </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1gjn684/rpg_recommendations_for_a_threeweek_break/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a hre
