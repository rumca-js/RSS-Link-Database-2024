In hardware news this week, we talk major industry news from Intel, Super Micro, and Qualcomm and Arm. The lawsuits are flowing, apparently, with Intel being sued over Raptor Lake stability (or instability, rather) and Qualcomm and Arm continuing to sue each other. We also talk about the rumored AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D. On the GN side, we prepare for a 9800X3D XOC livestream, correct the result of some unexpected BIOS behaviors, and finalize the hurricane relief donation.

This livestream features the AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D CPU getting overclocked with liquid nitrogen (LN2). We're planning to run gaming benchmarks with Stellaris this time, deviating from the usual Cinebench tests. This will give us a real-world gaming benchmark to test against.
