A study published in iScience found that chimpanzees performed better on challenging tasks when observed by humans. The research, conducted by Kyoto University, revealed that the presence of a larger human audience improved performance on difficult tasks, while simpler tasks saw a decline in accuracy. This suggests that the audience effect, often linked to human reputation management, may also exist in non-human primates. The study provides insights into social behaviours that might have evolved before the emergence of human reputation-based societies.

Sewage surveillance is emerging as a crucial method in combating antimicrobial resistance (AMR), according to new research from Virginia Tech. Published in Nature Water, the study demonstrates that monitoring wastewater provides a more efficient and comprehensive approach to tracking antibiotic-resistant bacteria than testing individuals. This method holds particular promise for underserved communities, where access to healthcare is limited, and AMR-related diseases are most prevalent. The research team, led by experts such as Dr. Leigh-Anne Krometis and Dr. Marc Edwards, explored sewage samples from 62 countries and found significant correlations between AMR levels and socioeconomic factors, such as healthcare accessibility. By examining wastewater, public health officials could gain early insights into AMR spread, allowing them to take targeted actions to protect vulnerable populations. This approach could revolutionise AMR monitoring, particularly in rural and low-income areas, wh
