Craig Finn is fascinated by the creative process, including the experiences, stories and memories that inform songwriting. Finn has certainly written many songs — he’s released nine studio albums with his band the Hold Steady as well as another five solo releases — and now he’s branched out into the podcast world where he can talk to other creative people about their memories and stories and what inspires them.
