<p>There are many open source programs (aka code that’s accessible to the public) out there for both Linux and Windows. For programs and tools where that’s not the case, <strong>WSL </strong>(Windows Subsystem for Linux) is the ideal solution for using Linux programs on Windows computers. This means that you don’t have to start Linux first and can use the Linux program in the currently active Windows.</p>



<p>Programs in WSL run slower than under native Linux, but it’s not always noticeable. Microsoft is also continuing to work on improvements that will be incorporated into the Linux kernel. A <strong>newer kernel</strong> can therefore speed up WSL.</p>

<p>A little while back, I made a big change to my desktop PC workflow — I swapped my pair of 24-inch desktop monitors for a single 35-inch ultrawide display, which stretches much further side-to-side than a traditional widescreen monitor does.</p>



<p>Ultrawides used to be a luxury in the monitor world, but prices have come down in recent years, and even basic computers like <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2079827/i-switched-my-desktop-for-mini-pc-and-regret-nothing.html">my $300 mini-PC</a> have become powerful enough to push <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1470449/best-ultrawide-monitors.html">an ultrawide’s extra pixels</a> without dedicated graphics cards.</p>
