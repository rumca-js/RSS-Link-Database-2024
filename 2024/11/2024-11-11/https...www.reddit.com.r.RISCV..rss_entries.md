I saw a post here a few weeks ago and decided to give it a try. My board arrived today, and I jumped right into running Minecraft, but it keeps throwing an error. Is there some way I can run it using a translation layer or something else I might be missing?</p> <p>Thanks in advance!</p> <p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/9ek1gpy9rb0e1.png?width=861&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=52bfd354301117c7b8d044ed4879f0f2ab69d435">https://preview.redd.it/9ek1gpy9rb0e1.png?width=861&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=52bfd354301117c7b8d044ed4879f0f2ab69d
