## Questions about Steamless and Goldberg

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am trying to take a few games I own on steam and make them DRM free. I am currently under the impression that I need to use both Steamless and Goldberg to achieve this, but I am a little foggy on what these things actually do and how to best use them.</p> <p>For context, the games I am trying to remove the DRM from have no DRM outside of Steam DRM. My understanding is that Steamless will modify the exe to remove the steam client wrapper from the exe itself, and then I need to use Goldberg to modify the steam DLLs.</p> <p>One point of confusion I have is many people are calling Goldberg a &quot;steam emulator.&quot; Does this mean I need Golberg running to play any of these games, or do I run Goldberg once to modify the files and then I am good?</p> <p>Any advice or a basic rundown of how this process works would be greatly appreciated!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/OverAster"> /u/OverAster </

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I recently found out about it and, in my opinion, it has the best and cleanest website design from the alternatives while also having a large diversity of content categories ranging from TV series, movies and even anime and manga, not only that it is pretty fast as well.</p> <p>With that being said, all of the above only applies when the website actually works properly which unfortunately it often doesn&#39;t, for example, when i go to the TV shows tab and click on a random one, like &quot;Chronicles of the Sun&quot;, it often gives me the &quot;404 file not found&quot; and a lot of times it just keeps loading forever like it does with the &quot;Boruto&quot; anime.</p> <p>The website has incredible potential and it&#39;s great when it does work so i keep an eye on it in case it eventually and hopefully gets fixed.</p> <p>What are your thoughts and experiences with this one and will it ever be fixed?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <
