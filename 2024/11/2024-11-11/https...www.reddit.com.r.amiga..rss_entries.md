## Indiana Jones And The Fate Of Atlantis Amiga

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>&quot;Fate of Atlantis&quot; is clearly the ideal Indy adventure experience. Even though it&#39;s 32 years old, the game is still just as fresh, fun, and innovative today as it must have been when it first came out in 1992. Probably one of my favorite facets about this game is its main body staying essentially the same, though it&#39;s approachable from three different paths . <a href="https://youtu.be/rKmomMUTQuw">https://youtu.be/rKmomMUTQuw</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Westraat1"> /u/Westraat1 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1goou4j/indiana_jones_and_the_fate_of_atlantis_amiga/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1goou4j/indiana_jones_and_the_fate_of_atlantis_amiga/">[comments]</a></span>
