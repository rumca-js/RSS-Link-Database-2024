<p>In a significant escalation of US efforts to limit China’s access to advanced technology, the Department of Commerce has reportedly mandated Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) to cease shipments of high-performance AI chips to Chinese customers.</p>



<p>The directive, effective Monday, restricts the export of TSMC’s 7-nanometer and more advanced processors, which are widely used in AI applications, Reuters reported.</p>



<p>The US Commerce Department’s latest move specifically targets chips that can power AI accelerators and GPUs, with a particular focus on halting indirect access to restricted technology by Chinese companies like Huawei, which the US considers a national securit

(That’s not counting things such as my Internet bill, $120 a month for AT&T 2Gbps fiber.) I’m talking about Netflix, Google One, <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>, and other services and publications I actually want. </p>



<p>But there were also over $100 worth of subscriptions that, frankly, I’d forgotten about  and no longer wanted or needed. That’s real money.</p>
