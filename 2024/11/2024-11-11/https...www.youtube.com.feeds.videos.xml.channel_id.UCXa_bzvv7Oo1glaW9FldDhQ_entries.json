As a spiritual successor to the Rollercoaster Tycoon series, it finally provided a contemporary template for fans to create the roller coasters they desired. To say that a sequel is highly anticipated would be an understatement.\n\nFrom the outset, Planet Coaster 2 looked enticing with improved visuals, new water attractions (from flumes to lazy rivers), and more. Unfortunately, it's all pushed by the wayside due to the unintuitive UI, which requires too much menu navigation, even for most basic tasks. It's bad enough that it brings the Career Mode (sporting intriguing objectives and annoying writing) down.\n\nThen there's the annoying pathing, the distinct lack of polish, the lackluster themes, and other features missing from the original.
