I have deployed my project in render. And i used cloudinary to handle my media files. I have no idea about database and storage. But i have opened an free account on supabase for my all users emails to store when they login into my render deployed webapp. So, basically i have added all the credentials of supabase in my project and migrated as well. The tables are also generated in my supabase&#39;s database but i can&#39;t see any data related users. this is because it acts as fresh database to store the data and the previous data which i used for login cannot be stored at all.
