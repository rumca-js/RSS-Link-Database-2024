Crypto is here to stay and stablecoins are the killer use case. They're now a real thread to the legacy payment networks and growth will only accelerate with a better regulatory environment coming.

We'd love to fund builders working on stablecoin ideas.

We all deserve to be safe on our own streets.

Did you know that YC-backed Flock Safetyâ€™s license plate readers are solving 10% of reported crime across the USA? Their goal is 25% by end of next year.

At YC, we would love more tech that brings public safety to everyone.

AI is great at automating repetitive administrative work and the government needs to reduce spending. 

Combine those two ideas and now could be a great time to build software to make the government run more efficiently.

YC would love to fund any builders up for the challenge.
