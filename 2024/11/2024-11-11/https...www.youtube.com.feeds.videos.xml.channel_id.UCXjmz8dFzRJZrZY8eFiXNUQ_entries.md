Superman Returns should have been a return to form for one of the most beloved superheroes ever created.  Though Brandon Routh's turn as Superman didn't quite go as planned.  Debuting 2 years before Iron Man would jumpstart the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Superman Returns attempted to bring light back to the world of superhero movies.  Audiences however, were not ready to jump on board the coming book movie train just yet.  The intentions were there, but Brandon Routh and Superman Returns team just couldn't get the franchise out of first gear.  Paving the way for Zack Snyders eventual turn at jumpstarting his own Superman franchise.
