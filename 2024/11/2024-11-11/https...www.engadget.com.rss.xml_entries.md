<p>After briefly offering a transparent <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/steam-deck-oled-review-its-just-better-180038030.html">Steam Deck OLED</a> last year, Valve has announced its next limited edition variant featuring a bold new color: &quot;white.&quot; It&#39;ll <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck">cost you $679</a> when it&#39;s available on November 18, and it features the exact same hardware as the 1TB Steam Deck OLED. (Most importantly, it sports that gorgeous 7.4-inch display with HDR and a 90Hz refresh rate). There&#39;s also a white carrying case, naturally. While the perils of white console hardware are hard to ignore (especially for a hefty portable that&#39;ll surely trap plenty of hand grease), this new variant may convince early Steam Deck owners to make the jump.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Madden NFL</em> has been around for almost 40 years (really) so it’s high time the gaming franchise got the documentary treatment. Prime Video has got you covered. The platform just announced that <em>It’s in the Game: Madden NFL</em> <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://press.amazonmgmstudios.com/us/en/press-release/iits-in-the-game-madden-nfli-premieres-exclusively">will stream on November 26</a>, which is just ahead of Thanksgiving.</p>
<p>The four-part docuseries will explore “one of the biggest video games of all time” that “became a worldwide phenomenon, spanning generations.” The show will explore Madden’s “archaic 8-bit origins to its success as an annual must have.” Prime Video says EA Sports has given it access to the vaults, so there should be plenty of new footage for diehard fans.</p>

<p>For the first time <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/overwatch-2-5-v-5-212441103.html"><ins>in over two years</ins></a>, <em>Overwatch 2</em> players will be able to group up in teams of six. A three-week event featuring that format starts tomorrow, November 12. But there’s a twist: you won’t be able to select Kiriko or Sombra, or battle it out with an additional player on each side on Push maps just yet. That’s because in <em>Overwatch 2</em>’s first real taste of 6v6, Blizzard is taking us all the way back to the beginning with a limited-time mode called Overwatch: Classic.</p>
<p>You will be able to experience <em>Overwatch </em>almost exactly as it was upon its May 2016 debut. That means you can choose from the first 21 heroes, who all have their original kits and abilities. That means Hanzo loses his Lunge jump but regains his dreaded Scatter Arrow, Bastion and Torbjorn are vastly different than they are now and Cassidy&#39;s Flashbang once again stun

<p>The popular Shin Megami Tensei video game series <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://prtimes.jp/main/html/rd/p/000000031.000063904.html"><ins>is getting a physical board game</ins></a>. A Japanese company called Icrea is behind the effort and is <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/smtboardgame/shin-megami-tensei-board-game"><ins>launching a Kickstarter</ins></a> on November 12 to raise funds for the project.</p>
<p>SHIN MEGAMI TENSEI THE BOARD GAME (the company asked us to use all caps) is a “full-scale board game project” complete with 72 “high quality and detailed demon figures.” Collecting demons and adding them to your party is a major part of the game, so these figurines should help with immersion. It’ll also help with getting random demon figurines lost in the couch.</p>

<p>EveryGameGuru allegedly streamed <em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</em> across five days, weeks before its official release on November 7. After Nintendo had the videos taken down from various platforms, including YouTube, they continued live streaming on Loco and even included a QR code for their CashApp handle.</p>
