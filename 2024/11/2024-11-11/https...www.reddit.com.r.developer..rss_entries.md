<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Were a small &#39;team&#39; not much of a team maybe but each has his specialism. I happen to do the more complex work and on regular basis fix team mates problems which is okay to some degree normal. Although their me time is not productive to my projects there. One of tne dev whatever he does I need to keep an eye out he is not corrupting it all. Like an elephant in a porcelain room. The other person is loud noisy talks loud me next to him I cannot concentrate on my own work this is causing stress sometimes I work at home preferably longer periods so I can make progress. However company wants me to work preferably on location. I settled with not being so productive as I want to be. But it feels all wrong sometimes I&#39;d like shout shut up be silent I try to work her god damn, but I don&#39;t. And so my projects take longer and longer to finish.</p> <p>How you deal with stress causing colleagues who think that what they do is good and normal talki
