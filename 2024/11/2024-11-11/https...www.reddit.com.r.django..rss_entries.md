<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>i have used django to build my project within that i used smtp for mail sending, google OAuth for signup and google email verification link to login. I have deployed my project in render. And i used cloudinary to handle my media files. I have no idea about database and storage. But i have opened an free account on supabase for my all users emails to store when they login into my render deployed webapp. So, basically i have added all the credentials of supabase in my project and migrated as well. The tables are also generated in my supabase&#39;s database but i can&#39;t see any data related users. this is because it acts as fresh database to store the data and the previous data which i used for login cannot be stored at all. Plz somebody, could help me out?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Inside_Meet_4991"> /u/Inside_Meet_4991 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/1gp

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s a link to my previous post where I was facing issues in ECS related to running the migrations. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/django/s/nl53QfhjR1">https://www.reddit.com/r/django/s/nl53QfhjR1</a></p> <p>Currently my Djnago application is starting as expected in ECS and immediately without any delays. The issue I&#39;m facing right now is with the celery workers which are unable to start and shows logs after 2-3 hours later. I have used the &#39;flower&#39; tool to check if it&#39;s a cloudwatch logs issue but the worker itself doesn&#39;t register until 2-3 hours later. This is all running on ECS Fargate. The described issue came after some changes in the application. The same image is working in my UAT cluster though. I have checked the env files and ECS Task Definition multiple times.</p> <p>Suggest if you know something regarding this.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Baymax06007"

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone,</p> <p>I’m new to Django and web development with only a few months of experience. I’ve built some small projects, but I’m now working on one that involves storing files (like PDFs, images, and ZIP files). So far, I’ve only stored files on the same server as my app, but I’d like to understand other storage options better.</p> <p>Specifically, I’m trying to decide between <strong>local storage</strong> (keeping files on the same server) and <strong>cloud storage</strong> (like AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, etc.). Here’s what I’d love to know:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Pros and Cons</strong> What are the main benefits and drawbacks of local storage versus cloud storage for a small-scale project? I’m not dealing with huge amounts of data here, just a few files for now.</li> <li><strong>Setup Difficulty</strong> How hard is it to set up cloud storage with Django as a beginner? I’ve heard there’s more configuration involved compared to just saving
