<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>The Lost Bookshop is an interesting one; I picked it up on a whim (more precisely, because I liked the title and the cover), and was charmed by it for sure! One of these books that really feel like it was both written by and for book lovers. Which is - in my eyes - it&#39;s major draw. Recommended for those who love books enough they can get interested in their history, and find it easy to believe that books could whisper to you once you put them down.</p> <p>Only vague spoilers of story vibes ahead!</p> <p><strong>Genre:</strong> I do like the genre of magical realism this is, although found it a bit frustrating that until the VERY end of the book, the characters blithely ignore that magic is happening! Maybe that means there was a bit too much realism in my magic here ðŸ˜†</p> <p><strong>POV:</strong> The book does suffer from having three points of view to tell a story, with only one of these three characters feeling like a main character.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Last year I started a search for the most Epic fantasy series ever written. A broad interpretation brought a broad list of series, but I decided on <em>Malazan Book of the Fallen</em> becuase it was advertised as super dense, complicated with politics and war, with prose bordering on literature-quality.</p> <p>And boy was that all true.</p> <p>I sort of enjoyed my 400 hours of reading (and listening to the magnificent Michael Page&#39;s audiobooks) of this 10 book series. I found, both before and after reading, that there were 2 camps of people when it comes to Malazan: People who think it is exceptional, and people who did not finish the first or second book. </p> <p>Well I finished it and I thought the whole experience was maybe not worth the time.... But I did enjoy many aspects of it... but even after I&#39;m done I don&#39;t understand a lot of what the large plotlines were... Anyway here is the good and the bad from maybe the only person who th

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I recently got a box of my old books and it was filled with Sidney Sheldon novels. It took me down a memory lane where Sidney Sheldon was a huge part of my teenage years. I loved diving into his booksâ€”they were just crafted so exceptionally well, with gripping plots, intense suspense, and those signature twists that left me reeling every time. Few authors can match that blend of drama and intrigue, and Sheldon knew exactly how to keep readers hooked from start to finish.</p> <p>Some of my favorites are <em>Nothing Lasts forever</em> and <em>The Best Laid Plans</em>. Sheldonâ€™s characters, especially the leading women, were always captivating. They were powerful, resilient, and clever, even if they did all seem to be both beautiful and brilliant. But even with that, his storytelling made these characters feel so real and unforgettable.</p> <p>Which of his books left the biggest impact on you, or kept you up late reading just one more chapter?</p> </

Bloodhound and Mastiff arenâ€™t the worst books Iâ€™ve ever read by a huge margin, but they are some of the most disappointing, managing to break basically every single promise the first book sets up.

But Iâ€™m not planning on discussing the quality of the film, rather I wish to talk about how the movie is a genuinely awful adaptation of koushun takamiâ€™s characters, it genuinely I mean genuinely butchers and nearly ruining some of Koushunâ€™s well crafted characters ( specifically YOSHITOKI KUNINOBU. ) plus there are a lot of missing and changed elements to the adaptation, but i wonâ€™t go over them due to the fact things had to be changed due to the movie format. The only reason Iâ€™m going over the characters I mentioned is because they didnâ€™t need to be cut out or changed (in Shinjiâ€™s case, he still has a lot of scenes to himself, but they arenâ€™t remotely what happened in novel) </p> <p>The tldr is long, but itâ€™s not as long as the post itself, since th
