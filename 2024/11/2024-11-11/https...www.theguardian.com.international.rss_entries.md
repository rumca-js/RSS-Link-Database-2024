<p>Artist rose to prominence for his Ku Klux Klan painting and now his provocative, powerful work is on exhibition</p><p>In 2015, artist Vincent Valdez released his imposingly large painting The City I.

The painting, which many initially <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jul/18/how-a-painting-of-the-ku-klux-klan-is-causing-a-stir-in-texas">critiqued</a> for unnecessarily referencing a long-past chapter in American race relations, quickly showed its relevancy – as it was arriving into the world, Klansman David Duke himself gave then candidate <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> a presidential endorsement, and the four years of the first Trump presidency would embolden exactly the racial animus that

<p>US protectionism sparks concern, underscoring the need for balanced policies as wealthy nations’ tariffs can hurt developing economies</p><p>“To me, the most beautiful word in the dictionary is tariff,” Donald Trump <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/nov/09/trumps-trade-tariffs-how-protectionist-us-policies-will-hit-german-carmakers">told</a> business leaders in October. “It’s my favourite word. It needs a public relations firm.” Now, with his election victory, Mr Trump’s words&nbsp;send a shiver through global capitals. Many fear he may pull a curtain across the US economy, locking them out of the world’s largest market and cutting off access to US technology. These fears are amplified by last year’s contraction in merchandise trade – which was the first such <a href="https://unctad.org/publication/trade-and-development-report-2024">shrinkage</a> at a time when the global economy was growing.</p><p>However, it’s wise to take Mr Trump seriously, not literally.

First as the Microphones and then as Mount Eerie, he had accumulated a catalogue of songs through which he made sense of his world, written with a diaristic honesty that won him a loyal following.

<p>Much is unclear about how Donald Trump’s return to power will affect efforts to tackle global heating, but there are a few things we can say</p><p>You’ve likely already heard the worst-case takes: that a second Trump presidency is a disaster for the climate, and will almost certainly lead to emissions being higher than they otherwise would have been. There’s obvious truth in that. But it’s also true that Trump 2.0 will almost certainly not play out in line with immediate post-election predictions.</p><p>We have been here before. As the writer and analyst Ketan Joshi <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ketanjoshi.co/post/3la5esbjjgt25">points out</a>, in 2016 it was projected that Trump’s policies would lead to a steep rise in US emissions – a fork in the road at odds with the decline forecast if Hillary Clinton had won.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/commentisfree/2024/nov/12/donald-trump-us-election-victory-second-term-climate-change-policy">Continue reading..

Once upon a time, Russell Crowe’s beefy hero Maximus in Ridley Scott’s sword-and-sandal classic Gladiator was the honest soldier outside the snickering metropolitan elite, out to gain vengeance and redeem Roman honour in the blood-spattered arena, his raw courage exposing the politicians’ contemptible decadence. His defiant cry “Are you not entertained?” spoke to the showbiz-political complex of our own time and when it was alleged last year that most men <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/sep/19/the-roman-empire-why-men-just-cant-stop-thinking-about-it">thought about ancient Rome every day</a>, the suspicion was that what they were actually thinking about was … that film.</p><p>Now we are a generation along, and little has changed, in fact almost nothing.

<p>The economy matters, but the likes of Trump succeed by offering voters revenge for problems both real and imagined</p><p>Donald Trump, for the first time, won a majority of the popular vote. He took the US presidency with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/05/us/elections/results-president.html">huge swings</a> in his favour, increasing his share of first-time voters, young voters, black voters and Latino voters.

With Magpie, Daisy Ridley, who starred as Rey in the most recent round of George Lucas’ space opera, subtly signals that she would very much like to sit at Fisher’s table, please – by developing the story of this new independent thriller, working with writer Tom Bateman and director Sam Yates to make it a real

Glynn used to cook privately for my parents’ business partners, and through this connection my brother Al got his 15 minutes of fame at the age of 13. I don’t remember the whys and wherefores; I just knew that he was going to cook on the television! I don’t know if there was a brief, but my pa decided that Al should cook a fish dish: namely golden pan-fried fish with ginger and spring onions. The Chinese characters for this dish translate literally as “fried, sealed fish”, which loses all of its poetry, but what it lacks in translation, it makes up for in flavour.</p><p>My

But after 2020, Donald Trump and allies, who questioned the election results, targeted the certification process as a way of causing confusion. In advance of the presidential election, there were deep concerns that the former president and allies would try and block certification of the election results, starting at the local level.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/11/what-is-election-certification">Continue reading...</a>

To me, though, he was immortal, thanks to one of those family stories that mean so much when you’re a child.</p><p>Dad, a Methodist minister in Bradford, was about to leave for a church meeting when he realised that Caesar had propelled himself out of his water and on to the carpet, his orange colouring fading into the 70s brown pattern.

<p>Nikolay Stefanov’s documentary, which follows fans of FC Minyor Pernik, reveals much about what is behind this toxic masculinity</p><p>In the Bulgarian mining town of Pernik, a weekend football match is not for the faint of heart. Dressed in the black and yellow team colours, dozens of FC Minyor Pernik fans descend on the home pitch, the “Stadium of Peace”. The nickname is an ironic one. Staying close to its subjects, the camera shakes and bounces alongside the aggressive football fans as they hurl racist, homophobic, and misogynistic abuse at their team’s opponents. A restless and threatening energy thrums through each swaying body, as the men jump up and down in the aisles, even throwing themselves against the protective fences.</p><p>Much of Nikolay Stefanov’s documentary places us uncomfortably close to these kind of scenes, conjuring a striking tableau of football hooliganism, toxic masculinity, and economic angst. Among this group of frustrated men, the film focuses on Tsets

<p>Jane Swayne was devastated when her children’s charity lost its funding. But she found another path and passion – and became a professional chocolatier</p><p>At 62, Jane Swayne ate a chocolate that would change her life. On a visit to see her daughter, who was working in The Hague in 2013, the Somerset-based charity worker decided to buy a box of chocolates to bring home as a present for her husband. “I found a chocolatier who made these amazing sea salt and tarragon chocolates,” she says. “I ate one and realised I hadn’t tried anything like it before. I never liked chocolate as a child but this was miraculous. I decided I had to try to recreate them when I got home – one box wouldn’t be enough.”</p><p>Swayne’s husband, John, was equally enthusiastic and encouraged her. “I’ve always loved cooking but I had never tried making chocolate before,” she says. “I realised it’s a very labour-intensive process but ultimately quite simple, mainly relying on the use of fresh herbs like the t

## One thing I’m sure of: Harris offered voters nothing on Gaza, and it mattered in the result | Nesrine Malik

<p>Imagine how isolated in their trauma Arab-American voters must have felt to turn to Trump. But that’s what happened</p><p>I would be sceptical of post-election analyses in the wake of what is seen as a shock result. For both sides, voting patterns at this point are a sort of Rorschach test – people will see what they want to see. What I offer here is a mix of instinct and conjecture (what’s new, I hear you ask). But it is based on one specific factor that doesn’t come as a shock, and which was predicted to harm the Kamala Harris campaign. We can be certain that the Democrats lost voters because of Gaza. The numbers are stark. Another certainty is that those voters will still not be heard.</p><p>In Dearborn,<strong> </strong>Michigan, the largest majority Arab American city, Joe Biden won in 2020 with around 70% of the vote.
