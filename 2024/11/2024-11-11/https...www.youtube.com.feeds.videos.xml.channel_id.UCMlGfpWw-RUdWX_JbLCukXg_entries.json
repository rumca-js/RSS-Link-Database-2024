Unfortunately, the volatile keyword is among the most misunderstood aspects of the language. If you don\u2019t use volatile appropriately, you may find the compiler generating code that\u2019s very different from what you intended.\n\nThis session will help you write more robust device drivers that avoid common mistakes surrounding volatile. Step by step, it explains:\n\n  - Why volatile is necessary\n  - How volatile affects the code that the compiler generates\n  - How you should place volatile in object declarations\n  - Which statements the compiler is and isn\u2019t allowed to reorder around accesses to volatile objects\n  - How to avoid misusing volatile \n  - How to avoid introducing inefficiencies when using volatile objects\n---\n\nSlides: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2024/blob/main/Presentations/What_V", "id": 1495043, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeblxEQIPFM", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 420, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCMlGfpWw-RUdWX_JbLCukXg", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/GeblxEQIPFM/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "What Volatile Means (and Doesn\u2019t Mean) in C++ Programming - Ben Saks - CppCon 2024", "vote": 0}]
