The Mario and Luigi franchise has been dormant for a while, and series developer AlphaDream doesn’t even exist anymore, but it has returned with a long overdue new instalment in Mario and Luigi: Brothership- and honestly, we couldn’t have hoped for a better return. 

Excellent writing, oodles of charm and humour, a truly gorgeous visual style, consistently enjoyable combat, and genuinely rewarding exploration and progression come together in what is yet another major win for the Switch in the tail end of its lifecycle.

It may not seem like it now, but Frontier Developments' Planet Coaster was a big deal at launch. As a spiritual successor to the Rollercoaster Tycoon series, it finally provided a contemporary template for fans to create the roller coasters they desired. To say that a sequel is highly anticipated would be an understatement.

From the outset, Planet Coaster 2 looked enticing with improved visuals, new water attractions (from flumes to lazy rivers), and more. Unfortunately, it's all pushed by the wayside due to the unintuitive UI, which requires too much menu navigation, even for most basic tasks. It's bad enough that it brings the Career Mode (sporting intriguing objectives and annoying writing) down.

Then there's the annoying pathing, the distinct lack of polish, the lackluster themes, and other features missing from the original. You can still have fun with Planet Coaster 2, with improvements forthcoming. However, for now, it's hard to recommend.

Despite launching only four years ago, the Xbox Series X/S has received some pretty noteworthy titles. On the first-party front, there's Halo Infinite, Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2, Forza Horizon 5, Hi-Fi Rush, and Microsoft Flight Simulator. Each stands out as a noteworthy reason to own the console.

However, there are numerous multiplatform and third-party titles worth experiencing. Be it long-awaited games like Dragon's Dogma 2, Psychonauts 2, Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2, and EA Sports College Football 25 or blockbusters like Baldur's Gate 3, Elden Ring, and Cyberpunk 2077, the amount of variety is pretty stunning.

Check out the top 30 best Xbox Series X/S titles as of 2024. Regardless of the future, it's a pretty good time to pick up the consoles (outside of leveraging Game Pass and its ever-burgeoning library of titles).
