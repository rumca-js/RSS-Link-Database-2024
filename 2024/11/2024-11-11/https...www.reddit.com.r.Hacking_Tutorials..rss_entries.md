<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>For the last 1.5 months I&#39;ve been working on a blind sqli brute forcer. The code could be a little cleaner, but it works, and its pretty darn fast to boot! I know sqlmap is one of the most reliable tools that pentesters use but i needed a project and this seemed like it was going to be within my skill set. I haven&#39;t written python, let alone worked on a project, since college and I&#39;m very pleased with myself for actually fleshing this out and getting it to a useable state. I learned so much through the process! Please consider checking it out and giving me any feedback you have. It would really help me out! </p> <p>The repo is here:</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/c3llkn1ght/BlindBrute">https://github.com/c3llkn1ght/BlindBrute</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/GutterSludge420"> /u/GutterSludge420 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking_Tutorials/comments/1goggo
