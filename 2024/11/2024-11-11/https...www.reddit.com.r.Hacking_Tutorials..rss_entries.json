The code could be a little cleaner, but it works, and its pretty darn fast to boot! I know sqlmap is one of the most reliable tools that pentesters use but i needed a project and this seemed like it was going to be within my skill set. I haven&#39;t written python, let alone worked on a project, since college and I&#39;m very pleased with myself for actually fleshing this out and getting it to a useable state. I learned so much through the process! Please consider checking it out and giving me any feedback you have. It would really help me out! </p> <p>The repo is here:</p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/c3llkn1ght/BlindBrute\">https://github.com/c3llkn1ght/BlindBrute</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/GutterSludge420\"> /u/GutterSludge420 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking_Tutorials/comments/1goggo", "id": 1490825, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking_Tutorials/comments/1goggod/i_wrote_my_first_hacking_tool", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 535, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking_Tutorials/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "I wrote my first hacking tool!", "vote": 0}]
