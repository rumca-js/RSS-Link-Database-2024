<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been web scraping a hidden API on several URLs of a Steam items trading site for some time now, always keeping a reasonable request rate and using proxies to avoid overloading the server. For a long time, everything worked fine - I sent 5-6 GET requests per minute continuously from one proxy and got fresh data in real time.</p> <p>However, after Cloudflare was implemented on the site, I noticed a significant drop in the effectiveness of my scraping, even though the response times remained as fast as before. I applied various methods to stay anonymous and didn&#39;t receive any Cloudflare blocks (such as 403 or 429 responses). On the surface, it seemed like everything was working as usual. But based on the decrease in results, I suspect the data I‚Äôm receiving is delayed by a few seconds, just enough to put me behind others.</p> <p>My theory is that Cloudflare may have flagged my proxies as ‚Äúbot‚Äù traffic (according to their &quot;Bot Scores&qu

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey all. I&#39;m new to web scraping, and have a very simple project where I&#39;m scraping live data and performing a linear regression. Because of the place I&#39;m scraping the data from, I need to run selenium in head full mode. Headless instantly yields error for some reason. This solution works just fine on my machine, but when going to host on heroku I&#39;m unable as I need a GUI display. Any tips on how I can work around this? I&#39;ve tried XVFB, but it doesn&#39;t work.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Common_Objective_953"> /u/Common_Objective_953 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1golw1p/selenium_headful_mode_and_virtual_display/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1golw1p/selenium_headful_mode_and_virtual_display/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I just started looking into scraping an ecommerce website and realized after further research that this could take months for me. </p> <p>I&#39;m working with limited capital and am curious if anyone has managed to scrape large volumes of data from websites without spending too much when using a third-party company. I&#39;m also considering hiring someone from overseas to handle this. What key requirements or details should I consider before reaching out, and what potential implications should I be aware of?</p> <p>Any tips are greatly appreciated, thank you.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SnooSquirrels1110"> /u/SnooSquirrels1110 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1gojm8l/thoughts_on_outsourcing_web_scraping_time/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1gojm8l/thoughts_on_outsourcing_web_scraping_time/">[comments
