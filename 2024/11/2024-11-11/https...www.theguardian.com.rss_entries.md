<p>Foreign minister says talks continuing over Israel’s stated objectives of pushing Hezbollah away from Israeli border</p><p>Israel’s foreign minister, Gideon Saar, said on Monday that “certain progress” had been made on ceasefire talks in Lebanon, where Israel has been engaged in fighting Hezbollah for more than 13 months.</p><p>“We will be ready to be there if we know, first of all, that Hezbollah is not on our border, is north of the Litani River, and that Hezbollah will not be able to arm with new weapons systems,” Saar said. He added that diplomatic efforts were taking place through US mediation, but that the lack of enforcement mechanism in any future deal remained a stumbling block.<br><br>
 Israel’s stated objective in its ground invasion of south Lebanon was to enable the return of residents of north Israel, of which tens of thousands have been displaced since Hezbollah began firing rockets “in solidarity” with Hamas on 8 October 2023. Israel has said that Hezbollah would n

The act serves as the balancing point between the state’s negative duty not to interfere with individual liberty without good reason and its positive duties to prevent harm to vulnerable people and the wider public. The criteria for detention represent the threshold at which both of those duties are triggered: detention under the MHA is also a gateway to rights to proactive care and support both during and after detention. We may argue about whether the existing criteria for detention strike the right balance between the state’s positive and negative duties,&nbsp;but it is at least the same balance

We’re calling it – he’s a dead cert for the glitterball</p><p>For 10 interminable seconds on Saturday night TV, the lights went out. Thankfully, it was deliberate.

The 28-year-old Finn, who in 2027 will take on the top job at both the Royal Concertgebouw and Chicago Symphony Orchestra, gave a turbo-charged demonstration of what all the fuss is about, concluding with an earth-shattering account of Stravinsky’s Rite of Spring.</p><p>He opened on home turf with Sibelius’s Tapiola, a 20-minute evocation of the vast northern forests that ranks among the Finnish composer’s darkest utterances. Striding forth into the twilight with broad, confident gestures, Mäkelä swayed in time as woodlands thrashed and heaved, or crouched as if to brace himself against the musical onslaught.

<p>Arsenal deliver at last, Lauren Hemp’s treble sees her top the WSL assist chart and Chelsea have ‘two No 1s’</p><p>Five goals, five different goalscorers and a clean sheet – Arsenal’s performance against Brighton felt like it was a long time coming. So often this season they have created chances but not been clinical. On Friday night, however, they were in the mood, producing a high-intensity first half that left Brighton shell-shocked. Beth Mead and Emily Fox combined brilliantly down the right, Katie McCabe and Caitlin Foord equally so down the left to exploit the weakness of the visitors’ full-backs and fallible defensive structure. A trademark Mead goal reminded fans of more fruitful times, a spectacular finish from Frida Maanum the same. The special moment of the night, however, belonged to Lina Hurtig. Her 76th-minute header was her first goal in 362 days, a perfect return after the Sweden winger had spent the best part of the last year on the sidelines. <strong>SD</strong><

<p>The Canadian psychologist’s zealous exegesis of the Bible as a moral rulebook for life is long-winded and out of touch</p><p>There is an oddly entertaining, if largely unenlightening, debate <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cXGYAGeso">available online </a>between Richard Dawkins and Jordan Peterson, two big beasts of the performing sage circuit. They discuss the Bible, or more specifically, Peterson’s latest study of its contents in his new book, <em>We Who Wrestle With God</em>.</p><p>Dawkins, looking increasingly bemused, quietly but repeatedly asks Peterson if he really believes in the virgin birth or whether Cain and Abel actually existed, and Canada’s best-known controversial psychologist responds with a series of ever more excitable exegeses of the biblical text.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/nov/11/we-who-wrestle-with-god-by-jordan-peterson-review-perceptions-of-divine">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Ipswich’s young English duo catch the eye, Liverpool march on and the brilliance of Brighton’s Carlos Baleba</p><p>It took them an hour of huffing and puffing, but Arsenal did something at Stamford Bridge they hadn’t managed since September – they scored an away goal in the Premier League. After toothless performances at Newcastle and Inter in the past week – and last month at Bournemouth – Gabriel Martinelli’s cute finish was itself a moment of relief, but Mikel Arteta was frustrated that his team didn’t find a winner. Their expected goals figure was lower than Chelsea’s (1.27 to 1.69) but that does not account for Leandro Trossard’s costly miskick at the death nor Kai Havertz’s would-be opener, which was just offside. The Gunners will almost always control games, especially now Martin Ødegaard is fit and firing again, but that age-old itch has not been scratched. They are not ruthless enough and they still lack a penalty box killer. <strong>Dominic Booth</strong></p><p><em>Match

<p>A professor in plastic surgery cuts to the truth about one of the world’s most popular anti-ageing treatments</p><p>Yes, says Dr Afshin Mosahebi, a&nbsp;professor in plastic surgery at University College London: injecting botulinum toxin (commonly known as Botox) into areas of the face before fine lines start forming can slow their development – but that doesn’t mean you should.</p><p>“Facial wrinkles happen for two reasons,” he says. One is that when our&nbsp;muscles move, the skin over them is repeatedly scrunched and – in the same way that constantly scrunching up a piece of fabric will ultimately leave a crease – it begins to etch lines into the skin. The other reason is the thinning of the dermis layer of the skin, which happens “as we get older, and particularly as we are exposed to&nbsp;the sun”, Mosahebi says. The thinner it is, the more susceptible it&nbsp;is&nbsp;to wrinkles.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/nov/11/is-it-true-that-starting-botox

<p>Like most boxing fans I hate the idea of this deluded nonsense but there certainly seems to be a market for it</p><p>Mark Borkowski is the public relations maestro who has worked with everyone from Mikhail Gorbachev to Diego Maradona to Jim Rose, an American exhibitionist who used to hang weights from his penis. Borkowski also helped Ian Botham recreate Hannibal’s walk across the Alps with elephants, and, for his sins, was the mastermind behind Cliff Richard’s Saviour’s Day reaching Christmas No 1, despite minimal radio play. So who better to talk about the biggest sporting stunt of the year, Mike Tyson’s fight against Jake Paul, which will be streamed into 300m homes via Netflix this weekend?</p><p>Instinctively, as I told Borkowksi, I hate the idea. Most boxing fans do. It sells a myth that wasn’t even close to being a reality in 2004, let alone 2024: namely that Tyson is one of the most ferocious warriors alive, not a 58-year-old who lost 26lb in May after an <a href="https://w

<p>A fresh and feminist study of the pioneering Nobel laureate reveals her impact on the women she mentored and set on the path to prominence</p><p>Marie Curie carried out some of her most pathbreaking work under an actual glass ceiling and the toxic particles that swirled beneath it eventually killed her. What Dava Sobel wants to convey to us in this unabashedly feminist account of the great woman’s life is that the metaphorical glass ceiling was just as toxic to the society over which it was clamped.</p><p>Each occasion the two-time Nobel laureate had a new advance to announce to the world, she had to beg a male colleague to present it to France’s scientific academy, which barred women from its ranks. This iron-clad rule outlived Curie, hobbling her daughter Irène – another Nobel laureate – in her turn, and by the time a woman was finally granted full membership, in 1979, not only were both Marie and Irène more famous than most of the men who had blocked them, but that first female
