She&#39;s presently on the hunt for a series that is something of a merge between the Cosmere and ACOTAR. She wants the same depth as the Cosmere but with the &quot;girlyness&quot; (her words not mine lol) of ACOTAR without exceeding ACOTAR&#39;s spice level (she felt Silver Flame was too spicy). I guess if I had to sum it up she wants something like Stormlight Archive but, to put it in her words again &quot;you know Dalinar and Navani are fucking&quot; as opposed to it being implied. </p> <p>She would greatly appreciate any recommendations you all have!

I would also like the girl in question to have a strong personality but at the same time be very charismatic and fun.</p> <p>What I&#39;m looking for is to read an enemies to lovers romance or at least at the beginning they don&#39;t get along but with the particularity that it has a Disney style, in the sense that I feel like I&#39;m watching a movie from the studio when I read it, it doesn&#39;t have to be fantasy or even very cheesy.</p> </div><!--

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I&#39;m becoming a social studies teacher and would like to have some books in the class., especially ones that fit themes we might discuss in the class. I&#39;ve got some stuff in mind like Maus, The Uglies, The Killables, Tender is the Flesh, 1984, The Sparrow, The Humans, Braiding Sweetgrass, Fahrenheit 451, The Twits, Watchmen, V for Vendetta, and some comic book collections with some good messaging, but beyond what I already know, I&#39;m kind of lost. Can I get some suggestions? What do you remember being good, or think would be good for 15-18 year old thinkers to read.</p> <p>You&#39;ll notice that a lot of these books don&#39;t really go in too deeply about LGBTQ+ issues, BIPOC issues, and so on, so I would especially like some advice on those aspects. I think anthologies of short stories would probably be the most digestible there; I might even be able to use them for lessons/assignments.</p> <p>If it makes a difference I&#39;m Canadian!

Some suggestions would be great.

We don’t read as much as we used to and I figured it’s a good way to start again. I started this off with “The Little Frog’s Guide to Self Care” as it is a short read. We have read 7 rings of marriage however I am not looking for specifically hefty reads about relationships. Please let me know if there’s any more information I can give, and I’m sorry if this does not fit the sub! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/QueenPerterter"> /u/QueenPer

I don’t mind romance as long as it’s not the main focus of the story and doesn’t take away from the character’s journey (I hate it when the main character completely switches personalities when she falls in love with someone, or when lore is just a setup for romance). I don’t mind creepy things, gore, morally grey characters, deaths etc. Good portrayals of sisterhood and female friendship are also greatly appreciated.

It can be in the way it is presented, like House of Leaves, or in the uniquiness of the settting or plot.

I&#39;ve also read John Dies at the End, which I think is close to what I&#39;m looking for. It can be any genre, in fact it would be great to find something that doesn&#39;t exactly fit into any specific genre. I don&#39;t necessarily want to be lost the whole time I&#39;m reading it, so ideally it wouldn&#39;t be hard to follow the plot.

I have recently come across a few of her poems which have intrigued me so I was hoping to read more by her but after searching her up I am overwhelmed by the amount of books or books of her poems (some examples being The Bell Jar, Ariel, The Collected Poems, The Colossus and a few others). So I wanted to ask if anyone knows how I should go about starting to read something by her? Which book should I read first? And then which book next?… and so on. A bit of info along with it would be great, as I’m going into this blindly and unknowingly 🙈 Thank you! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/sunshineiskey"> /u/sunshineiskey </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1goswpw/is_there_an_order_to_reading_sylvia_paths/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1goswpw/is_there_an_order_to_reading_sylvia_paths/">[com

I&#39;d imagine the Bible has had a lot of influence on how European literatures depiction giants (it gives archetypes of Goliath, Samson, Go and Magog, Nephilim etc...). </p> <p>Does anyone know of a book (or even a chapter given how specific of a question this is) on the reception and interpretation of giants as a trope in mythology or literature? I come from a background in Celtic Studies, but have yet to find anything on this topic.</p> <p>Any help would be appreciated!!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Misneach99"> /u/Misneach99 </a> <br/> <sp
