## PSA for any 3D print designers/creators who have posted your prints online and do not want them used for commercial sale or without attribution.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have designed a few niche tools and items that I listed online back a few years ago all under CC Attribution or Non-commercial. I also sell a few of them personally. I have since discovered at least 2 of them listed on Etsy and eBay by the same US print farm. I contacted them and warned them to take them down or I would file a case with Etsy and eBay. They took them down immediately but did not respond. However, I also noticed their shop is full of 100&#39;s of items they scraped from Thingiverse and others, many of which were listed as non-commercial or at least attribution (which the seller does not state in the ads). They even use any photographs posted of the items from Thingiverse and other sites.</p> <p>If this is something you care about you may want to take a look at their listings and take appropriate action.</p> <p>Their eBay handle is worldofprints. They may have been banned from Etsy already but their handle there was worldoprints.</p>

Lots of time spent snooping around hardware and home improvement stores, looking at pipe fittings, utility boxes etc for project enclosures, stuff like that, imagining how I could minimally modify them to be the shapes I needed.
