<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I played this game a lot as a child in the 00s. I believe there were cards and we moved around a board. The box and board itself were predominantly purple. I think there were dealers, robbers, etc. in the game. I think you made deals with other people. I think the aim of the game was money. The box has cartoon-like characters on, and really was very purple.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello. My mother is elderly and has schizoaffective disorder with cognitive impairment. She likes games but has trouble with simple things. For example, she needs a little too many hints to learn words in hangman game. I would like ideas for simple board games, more based on luck than strategy, perhaps more aimed at children. But she has an idea when something is done for a baby and she doesn&#39;t like it. They may be well-known games, I don&#39;t know them well. It would have to have really simple rules. More intuitive things. I think she would be able to understand, for example, battleship but not much more than that. </p> <p>Thanks a lot! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/guaranajapa"> /u/guaranajapa </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1gp4z5w/game_ideas_for_seniors_with_cognitive_problems/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boar

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all: apologies if this isn&#39;t the right place to ask this question, but you all seem to know a LOT! </p> <p>I have a beloved uncle who&#39;s been hit with some cognitive and psychiatric stuff in the last year. He&#39;s in his late sixties. English isn&#39;t his first language (but he and I don&#39;t have another shared language between us). He doesn&#39;t usually like card or board games, but I&#39;m going to visit in a few weeks, and would really like to try to bring something with me to do with him. </p> <p>So, I&#39;m wondering: have any of you found yourself in this situation? Are there any <em>very simple</em> board games out there that you&#39;d recommend? </p> <p>He doesn&#39;t have any grip issues or arthritis that we know of, so small pieces shouldn&#39;t be a problem.</p> <p>If you&#39;ve tried this with friends or family members and had it bomb, or have a non-board game alternative to recommend, I&#39;d love to hear it. Thanks so muc
