## Splitscreen and couch co-op is so dead in 2024. 4 man parties on the same console seem to be a relic of the past. Despite friends list and discord parties, gaming is less social than ever before.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>TL;DR: New CoD has limited split screen. Split screen gaming is almost totally absent in AAA titles in 2024. </p> <p>I got an Xbox Series X about this time last year. Generally, it has been great. I already have a PC which I use to work from home, so its nice to have a separate console to play games on. That being said, I was shocked to see how few games even have the capability of splitscreen. With game pass there&#39;s barely games that can handle splitscreen, the majority of them having been made in the past. Overall, with two people it wasn&#39;t a huge deal. My girlfriend and I have been able to find a game here or there to occupy our time. She&#39;s more of a watcher than a player anyways, so it all works out.</p> <p>This weekend though, I had my friends over and we were hoping to play BO6 all together on the same screen. Though we&#39;ve played plenty online, its a total different experience playing on the same screen hanging out together. We

First of all, we can&#39;t kill any civilians, the game simply doesn&#39;t allow it.</p> <p>And secondly, any enemy you see is inherently hostile. It doesn&#39;t matter if it are the Cleaners, the LMB, the Rikers, Hyenas, Outcasts, True Sons or local thugs, they all shoot at you without any provocation. There is no instance in the game were you can walk past them peacefully without getting attacked.</p> <p>And it&#39;s also not a case of: &quot;Oh, these guys are just missunderstood&quot;.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>While busy with my probably 7th or 8th playthrough of Phantom pain, probably higher than that, It got me thinking of how epic it was when i first played it, First ever game i&#39;ve ever Pre-Ordered, First &amp; last game &amp; took a day off to play it</p> <p>Another amazing game is Ace Combat 7, that game has even more playthroughs &amp; i&#39;ve even done some personal challenges, like my last one was where i played the game through with my country&#39;s official aircraft, Gripen.</p> <p>In this age, its rare to find games that warrants multiple playthroughs, most these days are one playthrough and we move onto the next, Back in PS2, one game that got a shit load of playthroughs to the point i had to buy multiple copies of it, was Mercenaries: Playground Of Destruction.</p> <p>I really wish games was as good as MGS V &amp; AC7. MGS V in my books needs a Remaster &amp; naturally, Chapter 2 but we know it will never happen</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Good week everybody!</p> <p>As the title suggests, I&#39;m not very city builder-savvy, but I&#39;ve been having an itch lately to play one.</p> <p>The only colony sim/city builder games that I&#39;ve ever played were Oxygen not Included, which I played only for 30 hours through the years of having it and basically never got really into it, exactly because of its overly complex nature.</p> <p>The other one is Against the Storm which I actually played for like 70hrs in the span of two weeks and I loved it (nowhere near finishing the tech tree really) but to be honest it didn&#39;t scratch the itch for an actual city builder, the roguelike element is to blame here, although very enjoyable in it&#39;s own way. I loved the aesthetic and the ambience/music etc. It&#39;s also really hard to get back into after dropping because you&#39;d have to scale it back in difficulty settings and it&#39;s kinda demoralising?! I dunno.</p> <p>So basically what I want f

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello There! I was wondering, how many people from Switzerland there are here and if you know if there is a spot where you can meet and connect with other Gamers. I have discovered the Erupt Lounge in Bern HB and was wondering if anyone has been there before and could tell me what it is like there. Apparently you can Eat, play online and Tabletop games as well.

## What are some games where the secondary or tertiary antagonist is better than the main antagonist?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Personally I’d go with GTA Vice City &amp; GTA Liberty City Stories</p> <p>Sonny really didn’t have much of a presence in Vice City, and although he did call and threaten Tommy a few times, he only started acting towards the end of the game.</p> <p>On the other hand, I really loved Lance, mainly because his betrayal was unexpected and even when he betrayed, Tommy asked Lance whether he set both of them up, to which Lance replies that he only set Tommy up. This shows how much Tommy loved Lance, but because of Lance’s incompetence and impatience, he couldn’t strive to be a leader like Tommy</p> <p>Similarly in Liberty City Stories, I liked the rivalry between Toni Cipriani and Vincenzo. The main antagonist of LCS is really forgettable (appears in only two missions) whereas Vinnie had much more of an effect than that. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/HP_594"> /u/HP_594 </a> <br/> <span><a href="http
