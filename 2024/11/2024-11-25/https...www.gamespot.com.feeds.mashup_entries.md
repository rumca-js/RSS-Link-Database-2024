<p>Earlier this month, a report emerged that Microsoft was forming a new committee within Activision to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-dutys-future-design-plans-emerge-in-leaked-information/1100-6527996/">guide the future of the Call of Duty franchise</a>. Now, that future may be coming into focus as a new report suggests that Sledgehammer Games will be taking the lead on Call of Duty's 2027 release. </p><p>TheGhostOfHope--a Call of Duty leaker who has accurately reported on previous developments in the franchise--is reporting that Sledgehammer Games' next Call of Duty game will follow Infinity Ward's 2026 title, "which is presumably [Modern Warfare 4]." Hope also stated that Sledgehammer Games' COD is possibly Advanced Warfare 2 or "something new."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/theghostofhope/status/1860508353958498481?s=46&amp;t=gp9HY1NQP1eeZxZoq0Xxsw" data-has-image="true"><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet" data-con

<p dir="ltr">I often think about the era when Grand Theft Auto games were coming out almost every year rather than once a decade or so. In those off years, there were a lot of games that tried to fill the void for players wanting an open-world crime-drama game: True Crime, Saints Row, Mafia, Scarface, Crackdown--the list goes on. Presumably, no one making these games thought they would dethrone Rockstar. Still, they understood they could capitalize on the genre's popularity by giving players a new lookalike while Rockstar was busy cooking up the next GTA. Since 2017's Sniper Elite 4, I've viewed the Sniper Elite series as something similar, only in this case, the series it's filling in for is Hitman. Rebellion's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sniper-elite-resistance/">Sniper Elite: Resistance</a> won't outdo IO Interactive's incredible Hitman series, and it doesn't even seem to do much differently compared to the last few games in its own series, but if you've enjoyed this s

<p>Deep Rock Galactic is getting a roguelite spin-off called Rogue Core, planned for early-access release in 2025. Watch the pre-alpha gameplay teaser below.</p><p>Rogue Core is based on the same structure as Deep Rock Galactic. It still takes place on the hostile but resource-rich planet of Hoxxes IV. You can still play with up to four players in co-op. You still play as gun-toting dwarves delving into the deep places of the earth. However, instead of working miners, you'll play as the more militaristic Reclaimers, sent to investigate the abandoned deep mines close to the planet's core.</p><p>These deep mines were excavating Expenite, a rare mineral found only close to Hoxxes IV's heart. Unlike Deep Rock Galactic, you won't start a run fully equipped. Instead you'll use Expenite to upgrade your Reclaimer's weapons and equipment. If you are playing with friends, this becomes a "draft" where all players pick from the same set of options. What one player takes will be blocked off from

<p>Since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/halo-combat-evolved-review/1900-6076140/">Halo: Combat Evolved</a> debuted on the original Xbox in 2001, Steve Downes is the only actor to have voiced Master Chief in the video games that followed. Actress Jen Taylor has had the same longevity as Master Chief's AI companion, Cortana. However, according to Downes, he and Taylor were briefly replaced by other performers during the development of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/halo-4-review/1900-6399288/">Halo 4</a>.</p><p>Downes recently shared the story of his recasting on his YouTube channel. As the actor recalls, neither he nor Taylor were aware that 343 Industries--which took over the Halo franchise from Bungie--had already cast new performers for Master Chief and Cortana. According to Downes, testers complained about not feeling connected to the new voices for those iconic characters. But before Downes could return, he had to audition for the role he made famous.</p><di
