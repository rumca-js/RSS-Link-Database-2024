<p>External USB/Thunderbolt drives (aka direct-attached storage, or DAS) are a super-convenient way to quickly back up your important files, as well as store any data that you don’t need on your computer’s fast internal storage. They’re also extremely handy for transporting data between locations and devices.</p>



<p>While auxiliary storage and transport are great reasons to buy an external drive — backup is the primary reason your setup isn’t complete without one. To augment that, you’ll also want to <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407149/online-cloud-backup-services-carbonite-idrive-backblaze-livedrive.html" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407149/online-cloud-backup-services-carbonite-idrive-backblaze-livedrive.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">store important data off-site in the cloud</a> if possible.

<p>Black Friday deals on Thunderbolt docking stations for your laptop are nearly here, but that’s not stopping retailers from offering holiday sales early. </p>



<p>We’ve been on the hunt for the best Thunderbolt dock deals for several weeks now, but we’re consolidating them on this page as Black Friday approaches. I’ve reviewed docking station deals at major retailers, comparing them to my extensive reviews of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393714/best-thunderbolt-docks-for-a-laptop-pc.html">the best Thunderbolt docks</a> and my knowledge of their pricing. Even better, I explain <em>why</em> each deal is worth buying. </p>



<p>Want more? I’ve included a FAQ with more information: how to differentiate between the various standards, the price I’d expect to pay, and more. </p>

<p>Czech company Drake Labs has just released a new USB-C accessory called <a href="https://soundslide.io/">SoundSlide</a>, a touch-sensitive device that can be used to control the volume of your computer by swiping your finger.</p>



<p>SoundSlide plugs into any USB-C port on your PC and doesn’t require any drivers to be installed. It’ll work right out of the box, and you can easily adjust your PC’s volume by tapping or swiping on it.</p>

<p>USB-C is the one connection to rule them all. Its popularity has made USB-C a common sight on new monitors. A USB-C monitor can act as USB hub, giving you additional ports for connecting various USB devices, but the monitor’s USB-C port can also serve as a video-input alternative to HDMI or DisplayPort; and some USB-C monitors can even charge a connected device while in use.</p>



<p>The details of USB-C can be confusing, however, and pricing for USB-C monitors is often higher than that for monitors that lack the interface. See our buyers’ guide below our recommendations to better understand the nuances.</p>

<p>The last couple of years have demonstrated something that was once thought impossible: Yes, gamers <em>do</em> want a high-end portable machine that doesn’t say “Nintendo” on the front. The Steam Deck and its many imitators have blown open the market for portable PC gaming, and it’s bringing in some new competition.</p>



<p>According to a new rumor, we might be seeing a familiar face in the gaming handheld arena. That face is Sony.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-25/sony-working-on-new-handheld-console-for-ps5-games-to-rival-nintendo-s-switch">Bloomberg says</a> that Sony is seriously looking into a portable gaming machine for the first time since the PlayStation Vita more than a decade ago. What’s more, this wouldn’t be a phone derivative or a streaming-only device, like the currently active PlayStation Portal (pictur

<p>I’m a Windows and Android die-hard who’s loathe to admit it, but the iPad is a darn good tablet. And if you want a high-end tablet that’s a little smaller and more portable than the usual suspects, the iPad Mini is pretty much the only game in town.</p>



<p>Right now, you can <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09G9BXKF5?th=1">get this 6th-gen iPad Mini for just $300 on Amazon</a>. That’s a whopping $200 off the list price, an incredible deal that makes it way cheaper than the base model iPad.</p>



<p>To be very clear, this is a brand-new iPad, not refurbished or used. The only catch is that it’s the slightly older 6th-generation model from 2021, not the most recent one with updated internals.</p>



<p>But the design is otherwise identical, aside from the A15 processor (which is still a screamer for an 8.3-inch tablet) and the lower 4GB of RAM (ditto

<p>Portable apps are applications and tools that can be started directly upon clicking them, with no prior installation needed.</p>



<p>The advantage of this is that the programs are immediately ready for use and can be started from any storage drive — including a USB flash drive. These useful tools are then available for analyzing and maintaining any computer you slap the flash drive into, making them utterly invaluable for informal tech support duties.</p>



<p>Let’s take a look at the best portable applications for hardware analysis and system tuning, as well as a basic setup with media player, image editing, and word processing tools.</p>

## Is it time for Thunderbolt 5 storage? A first look at the fast (but raw) new spec

<p>Though it was a bit rough around the edges in terms of backwards compatibility, my first look at 80Gbps Thunderbolt 5 storage reveals a very nice uptick in performance — about twice the 40Gbps of Thunderbolt 3/USB 4 in certain benchmarks. Logical.</p>



<p>By way of comparison, that’s roughly as fast as an NVMe SSD on the PCIe 4.0 bus. And a PCIe 4.0 NVMe SSD is exactly what’s inside the OWC Envoy Ultra portable drive I used to test Thunderbolt 5 storage.</p>



<p><em>Note that you’ll see 120Gbps listed in the Thunderbolt 5 specs, but that’s uni-directional output for driving multiple high-resolution displays. Bi-directional transfers such as those used by storage devices are “limited” to 80Gbps, or roughly 6- to 7GBps after overhead.</em></p>
