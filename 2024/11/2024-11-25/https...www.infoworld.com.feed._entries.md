<p><a href="https://kafka.apache.org/">Apache Kafka</a>, <a href="https://flink.apache.org/">Apache Flink</a>, and <a href="https://iceberg.apache.org/">Apache Iceberg</a> are among the most popular technologies in the data ecosystem. While <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3651358/what-is-apache-kafka-scalable-event-streaming.html">Kafka</a> enables you to move data around in real time, <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2335162/apache-flink-101-a-guide-for-developers.html">Flink</a> allows you to process data according to your needs and <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2336385/why-apache-iceberg-will-rule-data-in-the-cloud.html">Iceberg</a> helps you access stored data

<p>In 2014, Microsoft Research <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/02/17/microsoft-launches-smart-visual-studio-add-on-for-code-snippet-search/">released</a> an experimental Bing Code Search add-on for Visual Studio and the web. It was a code snippet search tool for C# with a natural language interface, using an index of code from Stack Overflow, MSDN, Dotnetperls, and CSharp411, powered by Bing, running on Azure. The tool included a facility for changing the variable names from those in the snippet to those in your own code, but it didn’t work all that well. The accuracy was 70% to 80% for a single variable substitution, and fell rapidly as more variables needed to be renamed.</p>

<p>Why do enterprises so often choose to run applications in the cloud even when it may not be the cheapest option? Why do they turn to open source even if it’s not the most feature-complete choice? And why is generative AI so frothy hot even though, as my InfoWorld colleague <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3599030/cloud-providers-make-bank-with-genai-while-projects-fail.html">David Linthicum argues</a>, “Companies are good at spending money [on AI] but bad at building and deploying AI.”</p>



<p>The answer is speed. As an IT executive friend at a large financial services firm told me recently, it’s expensive to move slowly when market opportunities require fast execution. For him, it’
