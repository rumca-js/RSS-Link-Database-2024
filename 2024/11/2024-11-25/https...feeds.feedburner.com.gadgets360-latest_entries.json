The findings, detailed in Science Advances, reveal that hydrothermal systems were active on Mars during the Pre-Noachian period. Researchers suggest these systems, essential for life on Earth, could have made Mars habitable in its early history. This discovery sheds light on the planet's potential to host life during its formative years.",

The find challenges prior beliefs about the origin and timeline of alphabetic writing, previously thought to have emerged around 1900 BCE in Egypt.
