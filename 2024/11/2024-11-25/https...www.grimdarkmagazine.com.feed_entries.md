<p>It’s been a few years since Arcane dropped seemingly out of nowhere on Netflix to universal acclaim. With a near perfect audience score and praise for its story, voice acting, music, and phenomenal visuals, the series inspired by the League of Legends game became one of the most watched tv series on the planet and so there has been a lot of hype for the second, and final, season. Just like in the first season, Arcane S2 has been crafted with love and an attention to detail that makes it stand out in an animation field of greats (Blue Eye Samurai, Castlevania, Cyberpunk: Edgerunners) and ends on a high. Arcane S2 picks up right where the first season left off. There’s barely time to breathe as we witness the aftermath of Jinx’s attack on Piltover. We see how her actions have consequences that will bleed over all our beloved characters with Caitlyn’s mum’s funeral the following scene as Piltover demands revenge on the anarchist just after peace between the two seemed a possibility.
