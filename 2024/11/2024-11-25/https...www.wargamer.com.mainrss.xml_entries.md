								<p>This 2024 winner of the <strong>Warhammer 40k</strong> grand tournament at the World Championships of Warhammer is Folger Pyles, who came out swinging with the Adeptus Custodes against the 2024 runner-up John Lennon and his Astra Militarum. The match-up heavily favored the Militarum, but Pyles' immaculate play - and faith in the Emperor - saw him through to the win.</p>

								<p>The <b>DnD 2024 Fighter</b> is one of Dungeons and Dragons’ simplest subclasses, but that doesn’t mean it’s unimpressive. A class often falsely maligned as ‘boring’, the <b>Fighter 5e</b> packs a serious punch in combat and has plenty of varied subclasses and feats to experiment with. Plus, the 2024 rules make this beginner-friendly character option more tactical than ever before. This guide explains the rules for the Dungeons and Dragons Fighter class.</p>
<p>If you’d like to compare with the 2014 <a href="https://www.wargamer.com/dnd/fighter-5e-guide">Fighter 5e</a> rules, head to our dedicated guide. Or, if you’re looking to try something new, here’s all you need to know about the other <a href="https://www.wargamer.com/dnd/cl

								<p>The <b>DnD 2024 Paladin</b> is a part-martial, part-spellcasting class with explosive potential and a finger in many pies. A <b>Paladin 5e</b> is a holy warrior who uses divine power to smite foes, and with a careful build, they can feel <i>super</i> satisfying to play. This is still true in the updated 2024 rules, where some of the Paladin’s features were nerfed, but others became far more generous. This guide explains the Dungeons and Dragons Paladin rules in full.</p>

								<p>Arriving in February of next year, Aetherdrift is a racing themed <strong>Magic: The Gathering</strong> release which takes place across multiple worlds. Last month, when artwork for Aetherdrift was shown off, fans immediately sussed out two of these pit stops, but the third, a jungle plane covered in plants, proved more challenging. Now, the game’s head designer has more-or-less confirmed its identity: the prehistoric plane of Muraganda.</p>
