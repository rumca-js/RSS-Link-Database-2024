<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m hoping people can provide book series recommendations that approach the Lord of the Rings and other Tolkien works. I read The Hobbit, Lord of the Rings, The Silmarillion, The Children of Hurin and Beren and Luthien when I was younger and really enjoyed them. I havent read a lot of other fantasy books since then (a lot of science fiction/horror). Recently I have read The Name of the Wind, Mistborn and The Way of Kings. While I did enjoy those books to a certain degree, they haven&#39;t really scratched an itch for a series that compares to TLOTR. I find the mythology and mystery behind it the most intriguing in those books. I realize I am only at the beginning of those book series and I may end up with a greater appreciation once I&#39;ve finished them. It&#39;s hard to describe why I like TLOTR books over the others I&#39;ve noted but it might be the lack of an epic adventure and variety of creatures/life forms among other differences. In dep

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’ll start with my example:</p> <p>For me, I absolutely ADORE the dark lord trope. I can’t totally explain why. I think one of the main reasons is that I grew up with it through Voldemort in Harry Potter, Kronos in PJO, and Sauron in the LOTR movies. I love the idea of a great, pure evil who’s been long since defeated returning and gaining power. I find it to be so much fun. However, I am morally opposed to it in a way. I think viewing anyone as an absolute evil is very wrong. I don’t really think such a thing exists. I think people with no redeeming qualities exist but I also view those people as tragic in a way. They’re victims of their biology and their upbringing. That isn’t to say they shouldn’t be held accountable, but to view them as absolute evil by purely their own fault is just wrong to me. However, I’ll still read a fantasy book that discusses the subject.</p> <p>There are other tropes like this that I love but am still morally opposed to

Each book begins at a point of deeper knowledge than the last and ends at an even deeper layer as more of the truth is uncovered throughout the story. The exposition is sometimes mediated through revelations and function sort of like plot points and even plot twists. I love this.

When I was a kid this was fulfilled by the Harry Potter series for many years as they released I would read them. Then a huge break until the mid-late 2010s in which I picked up Brent Week’s Night Angel Chronicles and loved book 1, and didn’t particularly enjoy books 2 and 3 but finished the series and found it decent. </p> <p>Well another decade has gone by and I’ve gotten the itch again, and I enjoy coming of age tales more than old tales (like LOTR), but one thing I always find lacking in series and synopses I’ve read is when the Big Bad Evil Guy is just an unnamed, faceless threat with just a world ending motive. I want a villain whose just as fleshed out, detailed, with complex motives where you even question if his actions are truly evil or if you are on his side.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>As a response to some recent posts on here about unfinished series, I&#39;m curious which incomplete series have a first book which stands more or less on its own.</p> <p>I feel like I&#39;ve heard from some folks on here that Name of the Wind can be read that way, as well as Lies of Locke Lamora (not meaning to lump these two together as I know Scott Lynch is actually working on his series)</p> <p>What do you think?

I also only buy one copy per book. Having more than one copy uncontrollably bothers me number-wise (in a silly way I can&#39;t help). I always get the copy of the regular editions I like bes

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I hate asking this question as I know I know it probably gets asked all. The. Freaking. Time. So I apologize. I&#39;ve never read any kind of fantasy, but I really want to get into it. I&#39;m looking for a series that&#39;s finished and also not super long? I do have the Mistborn trilogy as a high contender, but would love to hear some other options. I don&#39;t mind some dark elements, but not really interested in grimdark. Other than that, I&#39;m pretty open to anything. I usually don&#39;t have any specific genre preference, I&#39;m pretty eclectic. If it has a good story and interesting characters I&#39;m in :) <em>(I am open to standalone books as well, but thought it might be fun to get into a series)</em></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Willing_Society_898"> /u/Willing_Society_898 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1gz94ff/good_book_series_to_start_with/"

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Just finished reading Terry Pratchett&#39;s, &quot;Guards! Guards!&quot;. The following quote is a passage I wanted to share. Spoilers for the book follow.</p> <p><em>Context</em>: A dragon has declared itself king of the city. It consults its enslaved advisor, Wonse, on how it will retain its rule.</p> <p><em>Note</em>: The dragon speaks telepathically, so it doesn&#39;t have quotation marks for dialogue.</p> <blockquote> <p>Foolish ape! How else can I make them do my bidding?</p> <p>Wonse put his hands behind his back.</p> <p>“They’ll do it of their own free will,” he said. “And in time, they’ll come to believe it was their own idea. It’ll be a tradition. Take it from me. We humans are adaptable creatures.”</p> <p>The dragon gave him a long, blank stare.</p> <p>“In fact,” said Wonse, trying to keep the trembling out of his voice, “before too long, if someone comes along and tells them that a dragon king is a bad idea, they’ll kill him themselves.”<
