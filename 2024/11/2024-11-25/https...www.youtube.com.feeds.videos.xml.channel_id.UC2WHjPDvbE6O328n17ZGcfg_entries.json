I've never touched the language so I'm not too sure what to expect, but that's part of the fun now isn't it? But that's not the only change I'm making. I'm testing out a variety of new tools for programming.\n\nI'm hopping back over to coding in Linux, but this time in NixOS, instead of Arch or Ubuntu, with a dual pc setup. I'm learning Vim motions and will use Neovim as my primary code editor over the next few months. I'm also trying out the crazy small 40% keyboard, which appears to me to be fairly inconvenient, but again, that's part of the fun.
