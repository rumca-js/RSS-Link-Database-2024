That said, I am worried about attackers accessing Immich directly, because it contains photos of my fami

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello, self-hosters. I&#39;m Rodolfo Berrios, an indie developer from Chile.</p> <p>Since 2007, I&#39;ve been pouring my heart into creating Chevereto, a media-sharing platform that allows anyone to build their own media-sharing website. Think of it as a self-hosted alternative to Imgur or Flickr, designed for massive online collections. Services like ImgBB and many others have grown on Chevereto&#39;s foundation.</p> <p>Chevereto is entirely self-funded. I handle development while my wife manages marketing. Together, as a small but passionate team, we strive to bring you something truly special.</p> <p>Today, I&#39;m thrilled to share our latest release: <strong>Chevereto v4.2</strong>. This update introduces <strong>user-generated tags</strong>, a powerful new way to classify and organize your media. We&#39;re also adding support for <strong>AVIF</strong>, improving storage handling, introducing more configurable limits, enhancing session managemen

The main goal is to have an app and/or webapp to act like a remote to choose which file/album/artist I want to play AND have the audio output on the laptop, where an USB audio DAC is connected, like a &quot;Jukebox&quot; function. If possible it would be great if the files could also be played on the remote device itself.</p> <p>I tried Jellyfin but it didn&#39;t had a &quot;Jukebox&quot; function, the only way to do this is to have a jellyfin app installed on the server (I tried, but I didn&#39;t achieve to install jellyfin media player or jellyamp on Kubuntu

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m part of a small photo/video production studio. Ten artists, lots of equipment. We specialize in video production, but we also have a lot of gear and a huge space so we also rent/loan out the space and gear when we can. </p> <p>We&#39;re looking for an open-source solution that will let us treat all of the equipment almost like a library. We have everything from workstations and network hardware to lights, stands, cameras, mics.... There&#39;s probably at least $3M worth of equipment in the space. We want to keep track of it all, keep track of who has what, watch all of our licenses, and maybe possibly be able to create lifespan reports. That last thing is not a deal-breaker. </p> <p>I&#39;ve been looking at Snipe-IT, which looks great but cumbersome. I&#39;ve also been looking at Koha which I think could also do a great job. </p> <p>One requirement is that we need solid mobile access, either via a mobile app or a very very good browser render
