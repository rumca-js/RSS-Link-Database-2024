## FUN swords and sorcery-ish with no politics?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m currently burnt out on &quot;fate of the world&quot; type fantasy and just want a fun adventure romp for a while. Also I am sick to death of political maneuvering and intrigue. Just send a few good <strong>adults</strong> on a quest, then let them succeed and have some fun along the way, you know? Romance as a subplot would be nice, but not required. Smut is fine. Recently read the &quot;Mead Mishaps&quot; and those were fun. </p> <p>Not a fan of urban/low fantasy, shape shifters, vampires, or any of the permutations of &quot;fae&quot;. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/serialcompliment"> /u/serialcompliment </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1gzxzih/fun_swords_and_sorceryish_with_no_politics/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1gzxzih/fun_swords_and_sorceryish_with_no_politics/">[comments]</a><

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have a coworker and friend who&#39;s highly philosophical and got him for secret santa. He enjoys self-help books but also psychology and classic literature. He grew up in a very difficult background and escaped that lifestyle, so I am especially looking for books that resonate with that. </p> <p>His favourite author is Kurt Vonnegut (no recommendations by him because I don&#39;t know what my coworker has and hasn&#39;t read). He&#39;s currently reading The Brothers Karamazov by Dostoyevsky. I would have gotten him Crime and Punishment, but I know he&#39;s been in a depressive slump. I&#39;d like to get him a classic that is nonetheless uplifting, but does not feel like empty hollow optimism. Bonus for Russian authors as I am myself Russian and can find good translations, but am unfortunately a bit behind in my perusal of Russian classics. </p> <p>Any ideas? </p> <p>Thank you!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.r

Only problem is he has ADHD and cannot focus on one thing for too long, and particularly ticks the “hyper active” into the HD.

He has also never read a book since primary school and can’t really understand “complicated” words - not his fault, again just a bit stunted. </p> <p>Anyway.. ideally looking for something that is easy and fast-paced; it can be as stereotypical as possible (he talked about sci fi or horror if that helps lol) he loves that stuff.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>As problematic as Gone With The Wind is, I loved the book- the unhappy ending, the beginning with Georgian society, the lavishness and extravagance of it all.</p> <p>The Help was an interesting read, the double life of Skeeter as she goes to these 1960s women’s activities and at home writes and interviews black people, learning about their life. Not as much old money, but more slice of life and drama focused.</p> <p>I also enjoyed Rich People Problems by Kevin Kwan, the whole money portion, crazy extravagance and familial conflict. The flashbacks to India and the occupation provided interesting contrast as well.</p> <p>I want a ritzy, old money, high society, gossip book- I want ridiculous first world problems, petty drama and grudges, and overall just society.</p> <p>Historical fiction not necessary, but seemed the best genre descriptor. I like multiple viewpoints, and romance is alright but not needed. Women’s circles &amp; drama abound! Thanks in

I need the quick hit of dopamine from finishing something to help me continue. I have no idea what my reading speed is currently so, expect it to be terrible. </p> <p>I do not like the topic of magic for the most part, but don&#39;t mind fantasy. </p> <p>I prefer post apocalyptic settings. </p> <p>Not big on romance themes</p> <p>Thriller And psychological horror is cool Body horror/gore is meh</p> <p>I&#39;m more of a wholesome creature so while no topic is really a trigger for me, I would prefer the adult content to be kept minimal. </p> <p>Thanks in advance! </p> </di

I’m a big fan of fantasy romance but I’m open to other genres too! Some books and series I’ve enjoyed are Neon Gods (I’ve read the first two), anything by Sarah J. Maas or Jennifer L. Armentrout, Guild, Zodiac Academy, Fourth Wing, and Phantasma.</p> <p>I’m looking for something with a spice level of 4-5. I don’t mind if it’s all smut and no plot, but I’d also love something with a gripping storyline that keeps me entertained. Right now, I’ve got Hooked, Wicked Beauty, and Bride on my radar, but I’m wondering if there are any other great recommendations I should consider. One note: I’d prefer to avoid any graphic on-page SA (so books like Haunting Adeline aren’t for me).
