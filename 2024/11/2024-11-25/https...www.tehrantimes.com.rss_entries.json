Now, with the dust settled on Trump\u2019s resounding presidential victory, Biden\u2019s\u00a0reversal\u00a0of this position last Sunday was an\u00a0unexpected escalation. It moved reporting from how the new administration would approach peace talks to sensational images of rockets and more war. To mark the\u00a0one-thousandth day\u00a0of the war, Ukraine fired Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMs) into the\u00a0Bryansk Oblast. Russia has responded by officially promulgating its\u00a0new nuclear doctrine, underlining starkly its willingness to go \u201call the way\u201d if necessary. Now, it is unclear if we stand on the brink of World War III or if, once again, it is all just another flash in the pan of informational warfare.",
