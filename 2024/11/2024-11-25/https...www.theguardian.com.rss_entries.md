<p>The sense that anything you don’t like can be cancelled is gaining ground everywhere, as Starmer finds out</p><p>It’s the logical conclusion to the disposable society. Don’t like the result of the last general election? Then just have another one. Who cares if the new government has only been in office for four months? If you’re not feeling markedly better off already then the new prime minister is clearly a dud. No matter that it actually might take years to turn around an economy that has been on its knees for more than a decade. Just never give Labour an even break. Keir Starmer is like a Premier League manager after a run of bad results. On borrowed time.</p><p>At least that’s what the likes of Nigel Farage and Elon Musk would have you believe.

It was already dark by the time she and her then husband, Scott, got to the hotel; she couldn’t see the ocean, but could smell the saltwater of a beach vacation. The next morning, she had just stepped out of the shower when water started flooding their sea-level bungalow. Thinking the water main had broken, they called the front desk. No answer. Outside the bungalow, they saw the remnants of what they assumed was a rogue wave. “The lexicon, the word tsunami, was not in our brain,” Xaver recalled.</p><p>Twenty years on, she remembers standing in an open-air beach restaurant, about 40ft behind Scott, watching another wave approach.

So you’re trapped in a space that’s no longer useful to you.”</p><p>Pretty soon, in fact amazingly quickly, people were using the word to describe everything – to the extent that Doctorow wondered this year <a href="https://doctorow.medium.com/my-mcluhan-lecture-on-enshittification-ea343342b9bc">whether we’d entered the “enshittocene”</a>.

There were people who thought it was the greatest rap battle in history, outstripping Jay-Z and Nas, Ice Cube and his former bandmates in NWA, even Biggie and Tupac. Equally, there were others who questioned if it even counted as a rap battle at all: noting that both participants were already superstars, rather than a “young, hungry MC using this as a vehicle to get to the next place”, veteran critic Nelson George described it as “rich Black men attacking other rich Black men on their social media, from the comfort of their own homes”.

<p>As she stars in new legal serial Matlock, about a lawyer using people’s prejudices about older people to her advantage, the Oscar-winner opens up about surviving cancer, the Sacklers and watching herself on screen</p><p>Kathy Bates plays an elegant game in Sky’s new reboot of the 1980s legal drama Matlock. She’s the eponymous lawyer Matty, forced out of retirement having fallen upon hard times, thanks to her no-good husband. Or at least that’s what she says.

But Bates would never have taken the role, she says, if that’s all there was to it. The show is certainly enjoyable, warming even, a bit like b

<p>Mexico is a leading international pork producer, but Yucatán residents say the waste oozing from hundreds of enormous hog farms is destroying the environment</p><p>The stink of excrement was the first thing the residents of Sitilpech noticed when the farm opened in 2017. It hung over the colourful one-storey homes and kitchen gardens in the Maya town in Yucatán, and has never left. Next, the trees stopped bearing fruit, their leaves instead covered with black spots. Then, the water from the vast, porous aquifer emerged from the well with a horrible, overwhelming stench.</p><p>“Before, we used that water for everything: for cooking, for drinking, for bathing. Now we can’t even give it to animals. Today, we have to give the chickens purified water because otherwise they get diarrhoea,” says one resident. “The radishes grow thin and the coriander often turns yellow. This has always been a quiet town, where life was very good until that farm started,” they say.</p> <a href="https://ww

We often rued the day that they had left him with three teeth. One was a canine that sank numerous times into the fleshy pad on my right hand. My daughter suggested we offer them extra to take it out, but I wouldn’t hear of it.

<p>Our heroes have an unexpected advantage over their murderous pursuers in The Machinist director Brad Anderson’s shadowy crime drama</p><p>This crime thriller unfolds mostly in a nearly empty apartment building supposedly in Boston, Massachusetts, although the end credits reveal it was actually shot on location in Malta. But that’s fine, because the whole exercise feels weirdly untethered to any specific locale other than the rooms through which the main characters scuttle, trying to avoid getting killed by armed men – who turn out to be cops, just like the male protagonist, Frank Shaw (Joel Kinnaman). The atmosphere gets a further dose of defamiliarisation thanks to the fact that Frank and his fellow victim, Ava (Sandra Mae Frank), are both deaf, a quality that makes them vulnerable but also gives them the advantage of being able to communicate silently through American Sign Language while evading their pursuers.</p><p>Frank lost his hearing almost a year ago, having incurred a he

<p>You can’t beat polenta with buttery mushrooms: it’s a hug in a bowl</p><p>Polenta is occasionally known as <em>pulenda</em>. It’s a reminder that both the name and the cooking method has its roots in antiquity and in the Latin word <em>puls, </em>a blanket term for a universal method: long-cooked, semi-liquid dishes, or “mushes”, based on cereals or legumes. Which leads us to another nice word-link: puls is also the root of the word pulses. But back to antiquity, where the nature of the mushes depended on where in the world they were made, and what was available.</p><p>In Italy, that was farro, spelt, barley, broad beans, millet, chestnuts; puls or polenta were made from them all. Then, in the middle of the 16th century,<em> mais</em> (maize) arrived in the north of Italy from Mesoamerica (the earliest examples of the genius of Mesoamerican agriculture were found in Oaxaca, and tiny cobs of domesticated maize dated from about 4,300BC). By the 18th century, maize was acclimatised a

<p>In a new series of writers revealing their go-to comfort film, an unlikely action flop gets a stirring recommendation</p><p>When I’m in a truly bad mood, about the state of the world or just the state of myself, traditionally uplifting movies (or music, or TV) don’t cut it for me. It’s not the movies’ fault, necessarily; it’s the act of pressing play on even a feel-great movie like His Girl Friday or Toy Story 2 that nags at me as overly self-conscious. It’s hard for the movie to have its desired effect when I’m giving it such a personal, specific mandate to make me feel better – a truly impossible form of video on demand. Instead, I need something that activates my lizard brain, something that goes straight to the pleasure center of my imagination, rather than engaging directly with my emotions. In recent years, that movie is Alita: Battle Angel.</p><p>Part of it is probably a form of penance for slightly underrating Alita when it came out. I gave this Robert Rodriguez-directed,

<p>Amad Diallo shows versatility, Ethan Nwaneri offers plenty of potential and Danny Welbeck’s role is key for Brighton</p><p>For the established full-back, a wing-back role must be liberating, permission granted to embark on an adventure in the other half. Amad Diallo was faced with the less desirable situation against Ipswich, a forward forced to track back as he slotted in on the right of Ruben Amorim’s 3-4-2-1. Diallo retained his attacking aggression, immediately rampaging forward and evading challenges to set up Marcus Rashford’s early opener. He was responsible in defence and one of United’s brightest performers in a mostly bleak display, even threatening to deliver a late winner when cutting inside into the box to let fly. Diallo is most likely just a stopgap in the position but his adaptability has some worth as Amorim searches for his best XI. <strong>Taha Hashim</strong></p><p><em>Match report: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/ipswich-manchester-un

As the movement marks its centenary, two new shows are celebrating its past and future</p><p>One hundred years ago last month, the 28-year-old poet André Breton penned the Surrealist Manifesto, shucking off “the reign of logic”, calling out “the pretence of civilisation and progress” and heralding “the omnipotence of dream”. Breton wanted nothing less than a new reality – one that might overturn a world shaped by religion, schools and governments – by seeking truths within the self: “The future resolution of these two states, dream and reality […] into a kind of absolute reality, a surreality.” To create it, he and his evolving gang of Parisian writers and artists turned to the unconscious, spontaneity, automatic creation and collagist games.</p><p>Two exhibitions mark the manifesto’s centenary in Britain this month, giving some sense of just how&nbsp;playful and

Known as “the Movement”, its members include Johnson’s former adviser, Dominic Cummings, the ex-MP Michael Gove, and a shadowy Conservative prime ministerial aide called Dougie Smith, of whom only one photograph exists and<strong> </strong>about whom details are scarce.

<p>Reverential documentary reveals how Luigi Lineri has dedicated his life to creating a temple of rock </p><p>For decades, Luigi Lineri has toiled along the Adige river in northern Italy where he has amassed an astonishingly vast treasure trove: rocks. A research endeavour, an artistic undertaking and even a form of time travel, this beautiful quest defies rigid categorisation. Guided by Lineri’s indefatigable passion, Giuseppe Petruzzellis’s meticulous documentary lends an ear to what the stones have to say.</p><p>Using title cards of white text over a black screen, the film divides Lineri’s collection into a myriad of themes. While some pebbles point to the technical evolution of tools in prehistoric times, others bear the artistic traces left behind by human creativity. There’s a streak of the existential and the metaphysical as well. From egg-shaped relics to stones that resemble genitalia, the origins of life on Earth are wondrously embedded into these inanimate objects. In mak
