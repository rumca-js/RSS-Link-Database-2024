Amad Diallo was faced with the less desirable situation against Ipswich, a forward forced to track back as he slotted in on the right of Ruben Amorim\u2019s 3-4-2-1. Diallo retained his attacking aggression, immediately rampaging forward and evading challenges to set up Marcus Rashford\u2019s early opener. He was responsible in defence and one of United\u2019s brightest performers in a mostly bleak display, even threatening to deliver a late winner when cutting inside into the box to let fly.

Guided by Lineri\u2019s indefatigable passion, Giuseppe Petruzzellis\u2019s meticulous documentary lends an ear to what the stones have to say.</p><p>Using title cards of white text over a black screen, the film divides Lineri\u2019s collection into a myriad of themes. While some pebbles point to the technical evolution of tools in prehistoric times, others bear the artistic traces left behind by human creativity. There\u2019s a streak of the existential and the metaphysical as well. From egg-shaped relics to stones that resemble genitalia, the origins of life on Earth are wondrously embedded into these inanimate objects. In mak",
