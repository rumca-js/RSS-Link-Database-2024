Object lifetime and execution order issues can be difficult to manage, especially without guidance from well-established best practices. Practical use requires interoperability with existing event loops and with non-coroutine-aware components. While some experimental libraries have started to be released, the C++ \u201casync ecosystem\u201d is still young compared to many other languages.\n\nWe will describe our path through this thicket and introduce Corral, a new open-source concurrency framework for C++ that attempts to tame it. Corral is built around structured concurrency principles, so lifetimes and control flow are easier to reason about. It does not provide any opinionated I/O layer, so it can work wit",
