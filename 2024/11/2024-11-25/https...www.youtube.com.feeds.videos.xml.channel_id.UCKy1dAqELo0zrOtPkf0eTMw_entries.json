        "description": "In today's Daily Fix:\nAccording to a Bloomberg report, Sony is getting back into the handheld business in a big way. The company is working on a handheld PlayStation to rival the Nintendo Switch, but it's still years away. Based on that loose timeline, it will likely face competition from a possible Xbox handheld, as well. Sony recently released the PlayStation Portal, but that was more of a PS5 accessory than a standalone gaming system, since it requires either a PS5 or a PS Plus subscription and very good wifi. In other news, Troy Baker will have a very big part in Naughty Dog's upcoming game, which shouldn't come as a surprise since he's the co-lead in one of the studio's biggest games (The Last of Us Part 1). And finally, we have a brand new Sonic 3 trailer.",
