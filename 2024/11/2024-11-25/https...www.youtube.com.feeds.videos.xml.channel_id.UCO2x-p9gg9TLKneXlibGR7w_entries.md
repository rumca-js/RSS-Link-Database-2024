A few months ago, Snazzy Labs moved to a new location: a 1950s grandma-core house that hasn’t seen any visual updates in decades. Peeling wallpaper, stained carpet, and more, harshed vibe ￼so we had to do something about it. In just over a week, on a very tight budget, and with most of the work being done ourselves, we did the ultimate DIY home office renovation!
