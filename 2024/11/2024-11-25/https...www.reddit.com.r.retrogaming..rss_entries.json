I have an older original Wii and a bunch of roms from when I installed homebrew on it. I really dislike that interface. However, now I see all these emulator sticks and devices for sale. Are there any ones that are legit like the ones that have the 40k games preloaded. I&#39;m fine buying one of those so I can pull the roms and emulators from it. But I also don&#39;t really know where to get emulators and roms from anymore. Even if I wanted to download them I wouldn&#39;t know where to start!</p> <p>Any help would be appreciated!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/I_Masticatedinpublic\"> /u/I_Masticatedinpublic </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1gzqufv/building_an_emulator_device/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1gzqufv/building_an_emulator_dev",

The speakers have: RCA, aux, hdmi and optical ports. The consoles I have are: Nintendo 64, PS1, GameCube, PS2, Wii, PS3, Xbox 360 and Wii U. I plan to adquire a Dreamcast soon. The cables I use are: SCART RGB, Component and HDMI, but I have Composite too. I have several hubs for all this cables. The ones with SCART are the biggest problem (N64 and ps1) but I will buy a upscaler in the nearby future so I guess I could take audio out of it with a 3&#39;5mm jack cable and send the video to the TV using VGA. </p> <p>Anyways, I&#39;ll aprociate any advice about this product or other sound system that could be good for my collection.
