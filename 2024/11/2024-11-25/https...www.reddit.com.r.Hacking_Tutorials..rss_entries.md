<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello! So for the past couple of months I have been developing &amp; updating an app that displays a lot of network information and lets you perform many different testing like Pinging, Wifi speed, DNS Lookup and many more. I also added the ability to save pdf reports to keep track of your network performance.<br/> Having issues with my own network &amp; provider for many months I wanted to keep track of the issues and be able to report them confidently!<br/> I would love to hear your opinion about this and any suggestions for improvement are very welcome :)<br/> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ping_test.ip&amp;authuser=0">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ping_test.ip</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/panos42"> /u/panos42 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking_Tutorials/comments/1gzno39/ping_tools_app_test_your_network/">[link]</a>

To address this, I created a kind of port of tools like Fluxion, Wifiphisher, or EvilTwin for the ESP32 platform. The advantage lies in its low energy consumption and compact size.</p> <p>Iâ€™ve packed it with features, implementing modern deauthentication attacks such as Beacon Negative Power Constraint, EAPOL Logoff, EAPOL Start Spamming, and more, designed to bypass Management Frame Protection (MFP) adopted in Wi-Fi 6. It also captures handshakes and PMKIDs with password verification
