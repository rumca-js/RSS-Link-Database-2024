Massive's first paid DLC for Star Wars Outlaws, Wild Card, may seem like your run-of-the-mill side story and for the most part, it is. However, it also marks the culmination of several updates for the bereaved open-world title, improving its stealth, combat, movement, and more. It's momentous in a way, representing several months' worth of post-launch work.

The good news is that those changes are mostly effective and provide a better play experience with Outlaws. The bad news is that there are still issues with enemy AI and polish, while Wild Card exemplifies problems with the dialogue and story flow. What starts as a potential Sabacc-focused plot quickly devolves into something else entirely, throwing out much of the intrigue in the process.

Don't get me wrong - there are some decent things in the DLC and the overall gameplay. However, it's not enough to raise the open-world title's stock.

S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 is an impressive game in more ways than one, but though we absolutely love the open world shooter, there's also no denying that the game is also a divisive one. 

It has launched with some blatant and significant issues, while beyond that, even by its very nature, it's designed to be the sort of experience that is absolutely not going to be for everyone. As such, here, we're going to talk about a few things that we absolutely love about S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl, as well as some that we didn't. Let's start with the former.

Players will reassemble again, and not just on Xbox Series X/S or PC. With the Grim Protocols update on December 3rd, Warhammer 40,000: Darktide is finally coming to PS5. It brings the ongoing conflict to a new platform for players as they battle the enemies.

Much like Fatshark's Vermintide titles, there is loot to earn, and levels to gain as you battle hordes of enemies with other players. However, Darktide isn't the same game as when it launched in 2022. Several new features like Party Finder and Mastery, missions, and weapons have been added over the years.

That's not even getting all the other changes and new features, like Havoc coming up with the next major update. Here are 14 things you should know about Warhammer 40,000: Darktide before picking it up on PS5 next month.
