This year we met in Lisbon, Portugal. We used the opportunity to work together in person to discuss high-level strategic planning for the future of the PSF. This year, we moved the retreat from January to September. We aimed to meet as a new board in person as soon as possible to build our trust and communication earlier- which has been working well!</span></p><p><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-b4d1675c-7fff-6dba-26f7-6130cea53874\"></span></p><h2 dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 6pt; margin-top: 18pt;\"><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-b4d1675c-7fff-6dba-26f7-6130cea53874\"><span face=\"Arial, sans-serif\" style=\"font-size: 16pt; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-weight: 400; vertical-align: baseline; white-",
