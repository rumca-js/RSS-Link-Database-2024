Ukraine’s quest for permission to launch long-range strikes on Russian territory seemed to have been resolved in October when, after hearing Zelensky’s “Victory Plan,” the Biden administration decided not to give the green light. Now, with the dust settled on Trump’s resounding presidential victory, Biden’s reversal of this position last Sunday was an unexpected escalation. It moved reporting from how the new administration would approach peace talks to sensational images of rockets and more war. To mark the one-thousandth day of the war, Ukraine fired Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMs) into the Bryansk Oblast. Russia has responded by officially promulgating its new nuclear doctrine, underlining starkly its willingness to go “all the way” if necessary. Now, it is unclear if we stand on the brink of World War III or if, once again, it is all just another flash in the pan of informational warfare.
