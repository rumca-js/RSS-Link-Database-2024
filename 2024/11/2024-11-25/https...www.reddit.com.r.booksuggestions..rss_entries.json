Not as much old money, but more slice of life and drama focused.</p> <p>I also enjoyed Rich People Problems by Kevin Kwan, the whole money portion, crazy extravagance and familial conflict. The flashbacks to India and the occupation provided interesting contrast as well.</p> <p>I want a ritzy, old money, high society, gossip book- I want ridiculous first world problems, petty drama and grudges, and overall just society.</p> <p>Historical fiction not necessary, but seemed the best genre descriptor. I like multiple viewpoints, and romance is alright but not needed. Women\u2019s circles &amp; drama abound! Thanks in ",

I\u2019m a big fan of fantasy romance but I\u2019m open to other genres too! Some books and series I\u2019ve enjoyed are Neon Gods (I\u2019ve read the first two), anything by Sarah J. Maas or Jennifer L. Armentrout, Guild, Zodiac Academy, Fourth Wing, and Phantasma.</p> <p>I\u2019m looking for something with a spice level of 4-5. I don\u2019t mind if it\u2019s all smut and no plot, but I\u2019d also love something with a gripping storyline that keeps me entertained. Right now, I\u2019ve got Hooked, Wicked Beauty, and Bride on my radar, but I\u2019m wondering if there are any other great recommendations I should consider. One note: I\u2019d prefer to avoid any graphic on-page SA (so books like Haunting Adeline aren\u2019t for me).

He loves Horror Movies (the more brutal the better and preferably paranormal). So I think thats the type of book he might also be into. As he is mot a reader jet I think more shorter books are better.
