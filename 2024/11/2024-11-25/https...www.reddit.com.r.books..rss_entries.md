<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Up until recently finishing Jazz, I would have said the objectively best Toni Morrison was Beloved and my personal favorite was Song of Solomon. Now I think Jazz may take both of those categories. Here’s why:</p> <ol> <li>This is the most innovative work by Morrison formally. The obvious formal parallel is jazz music, as the writing is meant to reflect the newly found freedom and raw emotion of the jazz age. But I would also draw a huge parallel to Faulkner, especially Light in August. The very disjointed, almost jarring switches in narrative, the intensely lyrical interludes, and the use of incredibly heavy recurring symbolism felt very reminiscent of the way that book was structured. </li> <li>The number of complex, nuanced racial themes touched upon within ~225 pages is staggering. You have the legacy of slavery (obviously) but also more subtle discussions of colorism and interracial identity along with the overarching theme of the opportunity and

I get how they are, but Rocannon&#39;s World and Planet of Exile both go up a star rating after I finished City of Illusions. I loooove the intertwining and the way Le Guin is telling these stories.

In spits and spatters here and there we come to learn that it was via magic in an ancient tome that he somehow gained possession of. We learn some really terrible things about him too but in those brief glimpses Maguire shows just how much ambition and ruthlessness the Wizard had to have in order to even cross over to Oz let alone begin the process of taking it over. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.red
