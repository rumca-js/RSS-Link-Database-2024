## Creating a platform that utilizes crowdfunding & crypto to help startups raise funds

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello guys,<br/> I’m creating a startup platform with a unique twist blending traditional crowdfunding with cryptocurrency mechanics. Here’s how it works: users can purchase our platform&#39;s cryptocurrency, but startups won’t be funded directly with crypto. Instead, when someone contributes to a startup, a portion of the platform&#39;s cryptocurrency is burned. This reduces the overall supply, potentially increasing its value while supporting startup growth.</p> <p>I’d love to hear your thoughts and feedback, I also would love to know more about the crypto space!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Alert-Ad-5918"> /u/Alert-Ad-5918 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1gzfztj/creating_a_platform_that_utilizes_crowdfunding/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1gzfztj/creating_a_platform_that_utilizes_crowdfunding/">[comm

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone! I&#39;m a 2022 graduate working at a service-based company (joined through campus placement). While I&#39;m earning well and have seen good growth in my current role, I feel I&#39;ve settled into a comfort zone that&#39;s limiting my learning potential.</p> <p>My current role has helped me gain good experience as a full-stack developer working with JavaScript, Typescript, React, Node.js, and AWS for cloud-native app development. However, I&#39;ll be completely honest - I&#39;m practically at zero when it comes to DSA. I&#39;ve neglected problem-solving skills since college as I was focused more on practical development skills and modern tech stack that helped me perform in my current role.</p> <p>I&#39;m planning to switch to a product company now, but I&#39;m hearing that strong DSA skills are crucial for these transitions, even for JavaScript-focused roles. To be completely transparent, I&#39;m dealing with serious imposter syndrome r
