Kate Stewart, Vice President of Dependable Embedded Systems at the Linux Foundation, joined us at the recent Open Source Summit to discuss the increasing adoption of open-source Linux in safety-critical environments, focusing on the Enabling Linux In Safety Applications (ELISA) project. 
Two new members, Hamburg University and LINC Software, were announced to contribute to the aerospace and embedded Linux sectors. The Elisa project aims to enable Linux for safety-critical applications, focusing on system-level safety analysis and collaboration with projects like AGL and Yocto.
The foundation is also working closely with groups within NASA and ESA to enhance their efficiency, effectiveness, and responsible use of taxpayer funds.
Upcoming initiatives include launching space-grade Linux and enhancing transparency through SPDX 3.0 S-BOM generation. A key focus of the project remains breaking down silos and improving efficiency in safety analysis across various domains.
