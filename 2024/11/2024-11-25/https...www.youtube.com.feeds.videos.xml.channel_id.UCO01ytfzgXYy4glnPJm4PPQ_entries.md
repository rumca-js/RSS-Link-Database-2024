Today on the Matt Walsh Show, a father has been struggling for years to protect his son from gender mutilation and sterilization. The case seems to have finally reached a predictable but tragic conclusion. We'll discuss. Also, a medical expert testifies in the Daniel Penny case that the headlock was not what killed Jordan Neely. The woke head of Jaguar comes out to defend that ridiculous ad that everyone is mocking. And another video of a so-called "Karen" goes viral. I'm going to defend the "Karen" today. Not just this one, but "Karens" all across the country.
