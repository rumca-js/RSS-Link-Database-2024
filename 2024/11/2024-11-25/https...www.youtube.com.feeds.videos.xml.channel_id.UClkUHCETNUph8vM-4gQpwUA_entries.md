Soulframe Gameplay Impressions - Will it kick off a NEW GENRE like Warframe did? Pre-Alpha Review
Soulframe is an upcoming MMORPG being developed and published by Digital Extremes, the creators of one of the most popular MMO games ever, Warframe.
In this video, I’m going to be sharing my impressions after playing the alpha for Soulframe, a Fantasy co-op hybrid-MMORPG that is shaping up to be the next big game from Digital Extremes, the creators of Warframe, one of the most continuously popular games in modern gaming history. To put it into perspective for those who aren’t too familiar, Warframe has managed to retain around 50-100k concurrent players over the course of 6 years on Steam alone, which rivals the likes of Monster Hunter World and Final Fantasy 14.
