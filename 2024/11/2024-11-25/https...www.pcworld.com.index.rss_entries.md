<p>What makes the Kensington Thunderbolt 4/USB4 Quad Video Docking Station (SD5800T) a killer Thunderbolt dock deal? It’s not just about the price, which is at least $100 off right now.</p>



<p>For me, what makes <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kensington-SD5800T-Thunderbolt-Charging-Ethernet/dp/B0CJ2LQKMT/">this Kensington SD5800T deal for $187 on Amazon</a> so special is that this is my preferred premium Thunderbolt docking station in my list of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393714/best-thunderbolt-docks-for-a-laptop-pc.html">best Thunderbolt docks</a>, and it’s on sale for a better-than-mainstream price. I’ve tested it and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2252127/kensington-sd5800t-thunderbolt-4-dock-review.html">my SD5800T review</a> backs it up: this is a top-of-the-line docking station.</p>

<p>Makers and tinkerers, it’s time to warm up those soldering irons. Raspberry Pi has just announced an update to its itsy-bitsy, teeny-weeny microcontroller (the Pico 2), now with built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. The <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/raspberry-pi-pico-2-w-on-sale-now/">Pico 2 W</a> is available at Raspberry Pi resellers starting at just $7, a measly two bucks more than the non-wireless version.</p>



<p>The Pico series are microcontrollers — not standalone computers like the Pi series — but they’re still beloved tools for projects that need a little more functionality than you can get with hand-wiring or standard breakout boards. The <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2423222/raspberry-pi-pico-2-new-hobbyist-chip-for-just-5-euros-presented.html">Pico 2 was launched earlier this year</a> with an upgraded dual-core Arm Cortex-M33

<p>Picking up a laptop in the Black Friday sales can save you hundreds. But why stop there? You can save even more money by accessorizing your laptop with the extra things it needs while the sales last.</p>



<p>What kind of things might it need? A laptop stand, external hard drive or SSD, and peripherals like a mouse and keyboard will make using your laptop a whole lot easier. Then again, you’ll also want a laptop sleeve and surge protector to keep it safe and sound and extend its lifespan. Here we’ve put together a shortlist of laptop essentials to consider as you shop.</p>

It’s called the Snipping Tool and you can launch it by either using the <strong>Windows key + Shift + S</strong> keyboard shortcut or by searching the Start menu for “snipping tool”.</p>



<p>Once the Snipping Tool is open, you can record a screencast by toggling the mode from screenshot to screencast (by clicking the film camera icon). Then, drag your mouse cursor to define the area you want to record, whether it’s an entire window or just a certain section. </p>

<p>Microsoft has discovered that certain Ubisoft games are crashing after users install the Windows 11 24H2 update. Affected games include well-known titles like <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>, <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, and <em>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</em>.</p>



<p>After the major fall 2024 update is installed, these games either crash immediately upon launching, freeze shortly afterwards, or have audio problems. In some games, a black screen appears after a few minutes.</p>

<p>If you want to put a PS5 under the tree this year, now’s the best time to get one because several slim digital edition bundles are on sale for just $375 (in other words, up to $125 off their original prices).</p>



<p>For starters, the <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/sony-playstation-5-slim-console-digital-edition-nba-2k25-bundle-black/6595648.p?skuId=6595648">NBA 2K25 bundle</a> and the <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/sony-playstation-5-slim-console-digital-edition-fortnite-cobalt-star-bundle-white/6599015.p?skuId=6599015">Fortnite Cobalt Star bundle</a> are on sale at Best Buy for $375 right now. Since these bundles have the digital version of the console, you don’t get a disc drive. Furthermore, the games come as digital codes to be added to your account.</p>

<p>Microsoft wants you to use a Microsoft account when setting up a brand-new PC, but what if you don’t want to? Fortunately, Windows 11 (Home 24H2) works in the same way previous Windows 11 iterations used to–without a Microsoft account or the need to go online.</p>



<p>The best way to do this is to use <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows11" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the official ISO file from Microsoft</a> to install Windows 11 24H2 or create a USB stick for the installation. You can do this with official tools and sources from Microsoft. Additional tools such as Rufus are not necessary, as everything can be done during the installation.</p>

<p>The yearly fray of Black Friday consumerism is upon us. Yet, as I’ve been covering monitor deals in the days leading up to the post-turkey blitz, I’ve gotta say… this year’s deals are <em>especially</em> delicious. That’s doubly true if you’re searching for an OLED monitor upgrade, because we’re seeing the lowest prices <em>ever</em> for that expensive category.</p>



<p>We’ve checked all of the deals below for accuracy, value, and, you know, whether they’re actually worth getting in the first place. (We have decades of experience with monitor reviews, so we know our stuffing.) Since deals often come and go as promotions expire or stock runs out, we’ll also be regularly updating our deal picks to make sure they’re fresh.</p>

<p>Deals in these categories can take a little longer to heat up, but even with the sleepier start, a handful are worth looking at. We’ve pulled together our list based on user reviews, technical specs, price trends over the year, and feedback from the PCWorld staff.</p>



<p>If none of these suit you, keep checking back. More bargains should emerge closer to the big date, which this year is November 29.</p>
