Nice try, Xenomorph.&quot; </p> <p><strong>But at least on NORMAL difficulty, I really think this game is on your side and wants you to beat it.</strong> Some games make you have fun via good storytelling and great dialogue. Other games make you have fun by throwing lots of action and enemies at you and putting you in a flow state.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Apologies if this has been asked a lot/recently, but I hadn’t seen this specific question instead of the usual “which big name game haven’t you been able to get into”, so thought I’d give it a shot. Maybe even see if there’s hidden gems out there outside of the more obligatory rogue-like/lite. </p> <p>Genre-wise, for me it’s Metroidvania to no one’s surprise where the games tend to be fairly short in the modern age but completing them is so satisfying and each replay is about beating your previous time or completion percentage. I’ve played through Super Metroid and Metroid Dread fully twice but played through each pretty deep on a few runs afterward. Same with Hollow Knight. </p> <p>Otherwise kind of as a one-off, I played Kingdom Hearts II and beat it every summer from 5th grade-12th grade. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Wernershnitzl"> /u/Wernershnitzl </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.re

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey all, if this sort of thing isn’t allowed then I apologise and please delete.</p> <p>I’ve played games since the 90s. I remember my Dad playing RE1 and 2. They terrified me, to the point that even my younger sister would do a zombie impression which also terrified me.</p> <p>a few years pass, I carry on playing games. I used to buy a gaming magazine religiously, Nintendo Official Magazine (lovingly referred to as NOM). One issue had a huge feature about how great and different this new Resident Evil 4 was. At that, before CEX and trading standards intervention, people of any age could trade in games. No age restriction, no ID needed.</p> <p>for me, this felt like a conflict tailor made for me. I knew I was too scared to play a Resident Evil game on my own, but at the same time, if NOM said a game was a must play, then I did. I bought PN.03 and Geist as a 12/13 year having no idea what they were.</p> <p>anyway, I buy RE4. I’m anxious at first, but
