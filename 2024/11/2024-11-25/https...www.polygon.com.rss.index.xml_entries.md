<p class="has-text-align-none">If you can’t shop locally this holiday season at a friendly local game store, your friendly virtual independent TTRPG seller is happy to help — and might have a few more options. While itch.io and Drivethru RPG are the go-to spots for tabletop designers and players to find their new favorite game, independent distributors are offering discounted physical copies this Black Friday. Polygon has rounded up some of the best indie tabletop deals and bundles that these virtual stores have to offer.<br></p>

Yes, you’ll have to do some reading and therefore pay more attention while playing the game, but <em>STALKER 2</em> is difficult, so you’re paying plenty of attention anyway. The change-up is absolutely worth it.</

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the summer of 2021, as the world was still reeling from the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, I imagine that the team at Z-Man Games was rather desperate for a rebranding. The company’s hit game, titled <em>Pandemic</em>, had long been a welcoming entrypoint into the joy of modern board games. But the whole “millions of people dying and the budding culture war where we risked our own neighbor’s lives to prove a political point” thing was really gettin’ folks down on the term “pandemic.” Something had to be done. So, why not licensing? </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What makes a Black Friday deal legitimately great?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Decades ago, Black Friday deals were flashy. Local stores wanted their store to be customers’ first stop in the holiday season, hoping guests would spend the bulk of their holiday gifting budget. Shops competed with one another by promoting absurd deals, like free microwaves and $50 TVs, for the first 1,000 people in the door. A Black Friday deal could save you hundreds of dollars — if you were willing to wait all night outside Walmart.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You can take one look at <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tv/479973/dune-prophecy-desmond-hart-who-is-powers-how-fire-lore"><em>Dune: Prophecy</em>’s Desmond Hart</a>, the shifty interloper who is able to set people on fire with his mind, and say that at the very least he’s not being fully honest. And regardless of his intent, you should probably be careful with how far you can trust him.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So it’s a <em>little</em> odd the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tv/479937/dune-prophecy-houses-emperor-corrino-atreides-harkonnen-hart">Imperium’s emperor and empress</a> are so game to let him off the chain in episode 2.&nbsp;<

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s now officially the <em>League of Legends</em> off-season, not just because Worlds ended nearly a month ago, but because <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tv/482339/arcane-netflix-season-3-league-legends-spinoff-more-shows"><em>Arcane </em>has come to an end as well</a>. So, Riot Games is onto its next big thing, which happens to be the 2025 season update for <em>League of Legends</em>. All the details of the game’s next big update were revealed in a video on Monday morning, including its new the

<p class="has-drop-cap has-text-align-none">You could describe 2007’s <em>Mononoke</em> as a horror anime about a mysterious demon slayer. That would be technically accurate. It would also conjure almost entirely the wrong image.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So would saying that it’s rooted in Japanese ghost stories, or that it’s set in the Edo period, or that it combines computer effects with traditional 2D animation. <em>Mononoke</em>, created and directed by Kenji Nakamura (<em>Welcome to Irabu’s Office</em>), is more than the sum of its parts. It’s a detective procedural about a tantalizingly mysterious investigator combating vengeful ghosts, as told

<p class="has-text-align-none">To me, mods represent some of the best work happening in video games. I don’t just say this because these additions have allowed me to <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/21209">introduce anime boys to <em>Stardew Valley</em></a><em> </em>or <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63436?tab=files">put Margaret Thatcher’s grave</a> in <em>Skyrim</em>, but because modding has become a central part of gaming culture and development.&nbsp;</p>
