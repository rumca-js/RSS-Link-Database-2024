Sure, a $80 boardgame might seem like a lot, but with 4 people, playing a few sessions, that might lower the cost of the game to $1/hr per person, and that is pretty cheap entertainment. </p> <p>For example:</p> <p>Imagine an $80 boardgame being played with 4 people. If an hour of boardgame gets played, that&#39;s $20/person. If two hours are played, it&#39;s $10/person (80 / 4 / 2 = 10).</p> <p>If 4 people have played an $80 boardgame for at least 20 hours, that would make the game worth $1/hour. That&#39;s a really great cost of entertainment for an hour.</p> <p>With that being said, which I dount anyone tracks, but with that being said, what is the most recent game in your collection that entered the $1/hour club?</p> <p>In other words, cost of the game, and the collective hours played is the same.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddi

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Me, my wife, and our kids all love board games. Me and the wife often play boardsgames on date night and as a family, we set aside an entire day on the weekend as a family boardgame day. This has worked for us for the last year and half but recently my wife&#39;s therapist told her that boardgames are &#39;inappropriate&#39; as family bonding time and we&#39;re not doing good parenting by spending time playing boardgames with our children </p> <p>I just wanted to ask other parents who play boardgames with their kids what they think about this. In my mind it&#39;s something we all do together that we love. Boardgames can also teach critical thinking, problem solving, efficient resource management, etc. So our kids are learning all types of things too.</p> <p>How can that be bad?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Intelligent_Pound420"> /u/Intelligent_Pound420 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.red

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey, i’m really wanting to buy Dream Phone as one of my mums Christmas presents, but it seems to be out of stock everywhere online or really out of my budget, i don’t want to spend more than £40-£50 on the game as i’m on a tight budget, i’m not bothered about which version as my mum would be thrilled with either as she grew up with the 1991 version but bought the 2010 version when it came out and taught me and my older sister to play when we were younger but unfortunately due to multiple house moves etc has lost that one. if anyone can point me to anywhere that has it for sale (especially in the uk so i don’t have to pay extra for ridiculous shipping costs) i would be extremely grateful :) </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/OkTransportation5154"> /u/OkTransportation5154 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1gz6snp/where_to_buy_dream_phone_uk/">[link]</a></span> &#3

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone, I&#39;ve been looking for a platform for the boardgames community, but it seems like there are only old platforms out there and they are are hard to use. So, I decided to make my own boardgame community platform where you can easily keep track of your boardgame library, discover new games, log your games with your friends, and tag them. If you have any suggestions on how you would best use such a platform, please let me know. I&#39;m planning to release it in a few weeks so all suggestions would be much appreciated. 🙏🏻</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Puzzleheaded_Back_96"> /u/Puzzleheaded_Back_96 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1gz65ei/boardgames_library/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1gz65ei/boardgames_library/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Am I able to play TtA with friends on the app? if so do we have to be with one another? what are the turns like? Like are we able to take as much time as we want and play one game over multiple days/weeks? To be clear i’m not asking for a comparison between the table top game and the app. just wondering if i can play with my friends on the app and how it works. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Ok_Distribution_1437"> /u/Ok_Distribution_1437 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1gz5jwb/through_the_ages_app/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1gz5jwb/through_the_ages_app/">[comments]</a></span>
