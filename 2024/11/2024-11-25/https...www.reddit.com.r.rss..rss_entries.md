<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I recently became interested in using RSS and came across a project called <a href="https://github.com/RSSNext/Follow">RSSNext Follow</a> from github. I&#39;d love to give it a try, but I haven&#39;t been able to get an invitation code since I don&#39;t use Twitter or Discord much.</p> <p>If anyone has an extra invitation code, could you kindly share it with me? Iâ€™d really appreciate it!</p> <p>Thanks in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Fearless-Purple-5549"> /u/Fearless-Purple-5549 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1gzavyh/rssnext_akafollow_invitation_code/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1gzavyh/rssnext_akafollow_invitation_code/">[comments]</a></span>
