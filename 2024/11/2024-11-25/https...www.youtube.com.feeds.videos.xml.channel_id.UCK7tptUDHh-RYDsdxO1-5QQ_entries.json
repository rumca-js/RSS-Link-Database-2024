        "description": "President-elect Donald Trump vowed on the campaign trail to lower inflation. About half of Trump voters said higher prices were the largest factor in their decision, according to AP VoteCast. But the Federal Reserve is independent and uses interest rates to encourage or discourage borrowing money, which leads to more or less spending. So how much control does the president actually have over inflation?\n\nWSJ asked a former Federal Reserve vice chair to break down the inflation-fighting tools Trump will have at his disposal.\n\nChapters:\n0:00 Trump wants to lower inflation\n0:31 What can affect inflation\n2:35 What a president can do about inflation\n3:25 Where Trump stands \n\nNews Explainers\nSome days the high-speed news cycle can bring more questions than answers. WSJ\u2019s news explainers break down the day's biggest stories into bite-size pieces to help you make sense of the news.\n\n#Trump #Inflation #WSJ",
