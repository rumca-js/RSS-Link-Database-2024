<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi, I plan to port my software to 64-bit RISC-V (currently it runs on x86_64 and arm64), can you please suggest some decent dev board suitable for tests (running Go and C compiler and debugger), with built-in WiFi and HDMI, full Debian support, USB (ideally Type-C) power, preferably under 100 EUR/USD/GBP? Also case would be nice.</p> <p>I&#39;m currently looking at <a href="https://amzn.eu/d/c0kj5gp">https://amzn.eu/d/c0kj5gp</a> but it has just 512 MB of RAM, I don&#39;t think it is enough for my tasks, I want min 1 GB (that&#39;s what my test RPi has and it is ok).</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/q_r_d_l"> /u/q_r_d_l </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1gzgki4/please_suggest_riscv_dev_board/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1gzgki4/please_suggest_riscv_dev_board/">[comments]</a></span>
