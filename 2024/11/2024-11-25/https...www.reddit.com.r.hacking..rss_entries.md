I know in this community CEH is not widely popular. </p> <p>Currently have my Sec+ &amp; CCNA. Passed Sec+ in a week and CCNA took 3 months. Is the CEH or CySA+ harder. I know one focuses on Ethical hacking concepts while other focuses on SOC. But I need one to advance. Any idea which one is harder, beneficial in the eyes of HR, which one is more practical. </p> <p>Once i get this requirement out of the way I will pursue PJPT. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/S4LTYSgt"> /u/S4LTYSgt </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1gzm66j/ceh_vs_cysa/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1gzm6
