## Fantasy books with complex, developed relationships between characters

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>One of the things that can cause me to become very engaged with a story is when the relationships between characters feel like they are real - like the relationship consists of two complex individuals whose personalities, morals, and life experiences can interact with each other in various, sometimes unexpected, ways. I find I am usually far less engaged with a story if the relationships between characters are not explored, or consist of nothing more than tropes like &quot;wise wizard mentoring inexperienced hero&quot; or &quot;generic love interest who is there to look attractive to the protagonist&quot; without any more depth or nuance added to them.</p> <p>In that vein, what are fantasy books/series that do character relationship(s) very well? The relationship can be any kind, whether some sort of platonic relationship, a romantic one, or a hostile relationship. Both healthy relationships and toxic ones are encouraged, as long as they are well don

Often times its like having tv on on the background. I am not really interested or at the edge of my seat, have no tensions about what is about to happen. </p> <p>I remember as a kid reading Harry Potter, after midnight, school the next morning. Something interesting was happening, I WANTED TO KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN. I was rooting for Harry, I was tense with excitement and anticipation to see what will happen next. Of course this isnt the only book where I have had this experience, there are others, even relatively late. Such as Dungeon Crawler Carl.</p> <p>But so many books I just dont really care.

Finally, I recently read The Adventures of Amina Al-Sirafi, which again, was fantastic. Wondering what would be a good book/series to read next. At the moment, I&#39;m wavering between the following:</p> <p>The Sword of Kaigen by M.L. Wang</p> <p>Blood Over Brighthaven also by M.L. Wang</p> <p>The Shadow of the Gods Trilogy by John Gwynne</p> <p>Legends and Lattes by Travis Baldree</p> <p>Or returning to the Cosmere and Brandon Sanderson with Elantris (though admittedly I&#39;ve heard this one is just okay and would likely be reading this so I can get to Way of Kings and that whole series)</p> <p>I&#39;m also open to other suggestions if people have

I read Lightlark after hearing about all the controversies and it was bad but digestible. Nightbane was bad but I enjoyed it more than Lightlark. However Skyshade is truly horrible, so much so that Alex Aster is probably the worst author currently writing. I genuinely believe the publishers who refused to sign her we&#39;re doing god&#39;s work.</p> <p>Skyshade is book three in the series and nothing happens for most of it. Isla is still thirsting over Oro and Grim, despite both of them being outlines of caricatures of characters. The only dialogue those two ever have is a) talking about how much they love Isla, how they can&#39;t live without her, how she made them love life again or b) some pointless fact about their tragic childhoods.

I usually try to keep my expectations low whenever I get into a book to keep myself from getting disappointed but I went into TWOK with sky high expectations and I have to say that it absolutely delivered. Can&#39;t wait to read Words Of Radiance but I unfortunately don&#39;t have my copy with me so I guess I&#39;ll read Warbreaker in the meantime. For a book that big, I didn&#39;t expect to finish it as quickly as I did. I finished the entire book in about a week because I couldn&#39;t put it down whenever I had free time. One thing I will say though is that it is a lot slower than I expected and doesn&#39;t have the same amount of twists and reveals of the same magnitude that Mistborn had. But the scales and the steaks seem so much grander even though I feel like so little has been revealed. I wouldn&#39;t hesitate to say this is my best read of the year but seeing as I will probably be finished with Stormlight before

## How Low Stakes is Too Low Stakes?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Anecdotally, I&#39;ve noticed an uptick in people expressing a preference for lower stakes storytelling. Fewer stories about saving the world or the city, more about about running a small business, etc... That leads me to the question: at what point do you find the stakes too low to maintain your interest?</p> <p>Obviously, this is a subjective thing, and as I write this I realize that, for me, at least, this is impacted not only by stakes but by urgency/pacing. The grander the scale and the higher the stakes, the more I expect to take things slow. When the fate of the world has been in the balance for four doorstopper volumes, my suspension of disbelief starts to crack. Conversely, I have no problem with stories where there&#39;s no more at stake than some character&#39;s relationships, but if that&#39;s the case I expect things to keep moving or else I&#39;m liable to get bored.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www
