<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Ofcourse, after waking up today, finally i was delivered with the answer to my melody question, and i must apologise for having asked it here, it is just very remotely Amiga-related, perhaps the result of too much overall music consumed. It was (again, by the way, had this a year ago, too) :<br/> <a href="https://youtu.be/jQoeNSzqPrQ?t=207">Max Headroom German Television closing titles</a></p> <p>maybe to my defence: it is &quot;computer related&quot; and the melody really sounds very Hulsbeck-ish, imho, and although Chris started on the C64, i believe some of his best work was the Turrican Soundtrack for Amiga.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/multioptional"> /u/multioptional </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1h3h2h3/just_a_quick_followup_on_yesterdays/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1h3h2h3/just_a_quick_followup_on_

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m an old Amiga user from the early 90&#39;s and in my older age I want to use an Amiga again, just to knock around on it. The feel the classic Amiga mouse and keyboard on my hands. I&#39;m looking on eBay.</p> <p>A friend suggested I just setup Amiga emulation on a pi, but to me emulation versus the real thing is akin to tasting artificial kiwi flavor versus biting into a real kiwi.</p> <p>Just hoping to get opinions, thoughts, etc.</p> <p>Thanks</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/E_Howard_Blunt"> /u/E_Howard_Blunt </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1h31rbo/buying_a_used_2000/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1h31rbo/buying_a_used_2000/">[comments]</a></span>
