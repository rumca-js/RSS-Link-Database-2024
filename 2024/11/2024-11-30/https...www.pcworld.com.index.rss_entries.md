<p>Sure, you could build a box fort on top of your kitchen table, but a standing desk and comfortable office chair don’t have to be excessive splurges. Investing in good ergonomic equipment can be affordable—at least, it can during Black Friday.</p>



<p>Deals in these categories don’t always fly as fast and furious, but a solid handful are worth looking at. We’ve pulled together our list based on user reviews, technical specs, price trends over the year, and feedback from the PCWorld staff.</p>



<p>If none of these suit you, keep checking back. More bargains could emerge closer to the big date, which this year is November 29.</p>

<p>Whether you’re on the hunt for a lightning fast gaming rig or a Chromebook with great battery life, Black Friday is the best time to look for a laptop on a sweet deal. A lot of laptops can be found at a hearty discount, but some retailers tout big savings that aren’t really savings at all.</p>



<p>That’s where I come in (cue the majestic trumpets)! I’ve been overseeing PCWorld’s laptop reviews operation for years, helping our team evaluate hundreds and hundreds of notebooks of all shapes, sizes, and price points. I’ve compiled a list of worthwhile laptop deals from all over the web, from laptop manufacturers like Dell and Acer, as well as sales from online retailers like Best Buy and B&H. Not all Black Friday laptop deals are truly deals, but the hand-curated ones I’ve selected below certainly are. </p>

<p>Black Friday is here and the biggest shopping event of the year does not disappoint with VPN deals. Most VPN providers began offering killer discounts on subscription plans early and most deals are expected to run through the entirety of the holiday season.</p>



<p>Still, not all VPN deals are built the same. When shopping for a VPN, it’s important to know what deal is actually a great value. To help, we’ve tracked down and curated the top Black Friday VPN deals on offer during Black Friday 2024.</p>

<p>If you need a flash drive, Black Friday is the time to get one — we’re seeing prices drop like crazy. Whether you want to quickly transfer files between devices or just back up data in a cheap and portable format, you won’t want to miss these discounts.</p>



<p>Before you do, you’ll want to figure out how much storage space you need and what your budget is. While it’s true that you’ll have to pay more for greater capacity, the price-per-GB usually goes down, making it a better value to buy a bigger drive than you might need.</p>



<p>I’ve gone ahead and done the deal hunting for you. Here are the best Black Friday flash drive sales I’ve found, along with which one I’d buy and why each recommended deal stands out. There’s also a useful FAQ at the end in case you need more guidance before buying.</p>

<p>The yearly fray of Black Friday consumerism is upon us. Yet, as I’ve been covering monitor deals in the days leading up to the post-turkey blitz, I’ve gotta say… this year’s deals are <em>especially</em> delicious. That’s doubly true if you’re searching for an OLED monitor upgrade, because we’re seeing the lowest prices <em>ever</em> for that expensive category.</p>



<p>We’ve checked all of the deals below for accuracy, value, and, you know, whether they’re actually worth getting in the first place. (We have decades of experience with monitor reviews, so we know our stuffing.) Since deals often come and go as promotions expire or stock runs out, we’ll also be regularly updating our deal picks to make sure they’re fresh.</p>



<p>Here, in <s>no particular order</s> a very specific and carefully considered order, are the best monitor deals you’ll find th

<p>Black Friday deals have arrived, bringing plenty of delectable SSD and storage sales to choose from.</p>



<p>But not all the discounts are worth your cash. In fact, some are downright bad. That’s where we come in. Our list of SSD and storage deals are the best you can grab, especially given the rising cost for storage in the past year. These drives are not only well-rated and popular, but they’re at or very near all-time low prices, too.</p>



<p>By the way, if you see a bargain you like, don’t wait. The better deals always sell out, and we don’t expect this year to be any different.</p>

<p>There’s no better way to make sure you’re always ready to go and be productive elsewhere than to get a portable monitor, especially when it’s so affordable. Usually available for $110, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Arzopa-Portable-100-SRGB-External-Speakers/dp/B093GCL18V/">this 15.6″ Arzopa portable monitor is down to $57 at Amazon</a> for Prime members.</p>



<p>First of all, the monitor is light and slim, measuring just 1.7 lbs and 0.35 inches thick, so it will fit right next to your laptop. It also comes with a cover that doubles as a kickstand, so the screen is always protected.</p>



<p>The IPS display delivers 1080p images with bright colors and deep contrasts. That makes this Arzopa monitor ideal not just for writing that presentation you have to deliver by the end of the week but also for streaming content, doom-scrolling, or watching grainy l

<p>It’s that time of the year again when we’re raving about amazing deals day in and day out – and with good reason, too – because these are rather good. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beelink-SER5-Graphics-Computer-Support/dp/B0C2P486GQ/?th=1">Beelink SER5 Mini PC, for instance, is down to $299 right now</a>, a solid 23% under its $389 MSRP at Amazon.</p>



<p>So what makes this particular tiny computer so good? Well, first of all, it’s super powerful despite its size. Running on an AMD Ryzen 7 5800H processor and 16GB of DDR4 RAM, this is a device that can tackle anything you want, from your workload to streaming to gaming.</p>



<p>Should you feel the need for more oomph, the RAM can be upgraded to 64GB, which shouldn’t cost a lot considering its DDR4. Whether you do or don’t, you’re going to have a lag-free experience.</p>

<p>I love Black Friday component deals. You can combo-chain them to build yourself a gaming PC much cheaper than usual—no matter what resolution you’re playing at. During the rest of the year, you can find bargains, but it’s harder to pull together a full system (much less a kickass one) at the same prices.</p>



<p>In 2024, it turns out that despite rising SSD costs and slowed graphics card releases, you can still put together an upgradable gaming PC capable of 1080p High or Ultra at 60fps for just $550. And as a bonus for this year, this build packs a powerful CPU and lots of memory. All without any hijinx: The parts are new and sold by major retailers.</p>



<p>More interested in 1440p gaming, or scaling down to a more modest gaming build? I’ve got suggested builds for those scenarios, too—and they may surprise you. </p>



<p>Let’s dive in.</p>
