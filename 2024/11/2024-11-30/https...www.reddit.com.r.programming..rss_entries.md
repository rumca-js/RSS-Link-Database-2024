<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>At work, we have an application running in the cloud. We have multiple docker containers and images just to run this thing. We have an image that contains the next JS code, we have an image for the python backend server, and we also have images for lambda functions. I feel like those alone take years for our pipelines to build, then to test those doctor images for vulnerabilities, then uploading to ECR, and then finally running them.</p> <p>I guess my point is that when I do side projects, it tends to be much more simple, like a Vite JavaScript bundle that is built and exported as a bundle then deployed on some CDN. She’s crazy how complicated things can get and it makes it so that we really can’t test things very well until they’re deployed to a development branch. Makes the idea of local build and testing almost impossible. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/bunoso"> /u/bunoso </a> <br/> <span><a
