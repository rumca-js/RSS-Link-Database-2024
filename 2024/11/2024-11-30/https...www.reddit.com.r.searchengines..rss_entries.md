<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Lately I&#39;ve tried to Google how to resell certain adult content online. But predictably Google produces nothing of use and shows the opposite advice on avoiding getting scammed regardless of what you think about the topic. What can I not Google? And is this just internet censorship or is there another term for it?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/PlatformAlive9433"> /u/PlatformAlive9433 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/searchengines/comments/1h3nmxh/what_can_i_not_use_a_search_engine_for/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/searchengines/comments/1h3nmxh/what_can_i_not_use_a_search_engine_for/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>The search engine was reviewed on <a href="https://digdeeper.club/articles/search.xhtml#freespoke">this website</a> and the guy spent a huge amount of effort onto the review. We might have to think twice, before using the search engine now.</p> <p>P.S. There are a lot more search engine reviews on the website, but I decided to link this one for Freespoke review.</p> <p>I wonder what would be their response.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Aucteraden"> /u/Aucteraden </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/searchengines/comments/1h31zct/freespokecom_search_engine_review/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/searchengines/comments/1h31zct/freespokecom_search_engine_review/">[comments]</a></span>
