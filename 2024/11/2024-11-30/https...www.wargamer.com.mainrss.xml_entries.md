								<p>Before Space Marine 2 hit the scene, <b>Total War: Warhammer 3</b> was our favorite Warhammer videogame. Its crown might be contested by some of the Wargamer team now, but TWW3 remains a stellar grand strategy game. Thanks to Black Friday, it’s also cheaper than it’s been for a while, with a 60% discount available on Humble Bundle.</p>

								<p>The <b>Dungeons and Dragons</b> community has a soft spot for the original fifth edition starter set that was released in 2014, but I personally think that 2022’s Dragons of Stormwreck Isle is a better introduction to the game. Don’t believe me? Well, thanks to a 50% discount, the starter kit is now just $10 on Amazon – so now’s the best time to find out if I’m right.</p>

One excellent example is Worms: The Board Game, a chaotic and hilarious tabletop take on the wriggly computer war game.

								<p>It’s almost time for Games Workshop’s <strong>Middle-earth Strategy Battle Game</strong> (MESBG) to relaunch with a brand new edition (either its third, or its sixth, depending on which older books you count) - and the big launch box set, <strong>Battle of Edoras</strong>, will be its grand opening act. I’ve long lingered on the sidelines of MESBG, collecting but rarely playing. But this Rohan-focused starter set could be what finally tempts me to dive in - and I may not be alone.</p>
