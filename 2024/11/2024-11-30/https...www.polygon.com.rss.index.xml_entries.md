<p class="has-text-align-none">Where were you at 2 p.m. EST on November 30, 2024? If you’re one of the 14 million people who tuned in for Fortnite’s latest “Remix: The Finale” event, you were probably hanging at “The Doggpound” listening to what Epic is now saying is its most-streamed in-game concert yet. Of course, this is just the number of concurrent players watching live and in-game; millions more watched live streams on YouTube and Twitch. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“You. Showed. Up. More than 14 million concurrent players partied up for Remix: The Finale and more than 3 million estimated people streamed it online,” Epic Games shared on X, formerly known as Twitter. “This is a n

<p class="has-drop-cap has-text-align-none">I began 2024 as a casual RPG dabbler. I enter December as a hollow-eyed obsessive, forgoing sleep to grind a few more dungeons in a remake of a NES game from 1988. How did this happen?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The obvious answer would be that the sheer abundance of exceptional RPGs released in a short period was bound to convert some nonbelievers into frothing-at-the-mouth zealots.

<p class="has-text-align-none">I’ve been playing <em>League of Legends</em> since the game’s earliest days. I read the Journal of Justice, an in-universe publication from back when the League of Legends was a giant fighting arena for nations to settle political disputes. I witnessed the setting’s first big retcon in 2014, and the successive comics, events, novellas, and cinematics. <em>Arcane</em> is undoubtedly a triumph, both critically acclaimed and hugely popular. But the final episodes have thrown me for a loop. You would think my
