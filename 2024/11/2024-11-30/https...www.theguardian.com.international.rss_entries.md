There used to be a good view across the bay from these top windows, he says, but he had to sell the parcel of land across the street and now they are building “a monstrosity” on it.

For someone who, it is said, has spent eight to 10 hours a day writing for all of his adult life, Banville insists he is no lover of solitude. “You’re not really alone when you are writing,” he says,

<p>Don’t plump for the same old trimmings this year; shake things up with these stellar side dishes</p><p>Sides at Christmas so often flounder in the chaos that comes with tradition. “Turkey with all the trimmings” means you <em>have</em> to have roast potatoes, carrots, parsnips, sprouts, stuffing and pigs in blankets as a minimum, and they all end up being deeply average. I could go on and on about why I don’t cook turkey in my house, but the thought of doing a big “set-piece” meal on C-day is definitely a big reason. Truthfully, it is hard to cook that many things well at the same time; home kitchens aren’t made for it, and neither are we, the cooks. So give yourself a break and choose two or three knockout sides. Aim for a range of textures – one crisp, one creamy, one juicy – and methods (you don’t have to roast <em>everything)</em><em>, </em>and<em> </em>you won’t go back to boring again.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/nov/30/chorizo-parsnips-spicy-roast-pot

<p>As Manchester City finally become interesting, Liverpool have been rescued from chaos by the likable Arne Slot</p><p>There are certain fixed rules in scriptwriting. These are laid down by the kind of guru-led Californian movie masterclasses designed to help frat boys and slackers produce endless identical pitches, usually starring a troubled Nicolas Cage reuniting his family by machine-gunning central European men on yachts.</p><p>Introduce conflict. Make your chief protagonist complex but also likable, perhaps by having them wear a hat or sunglasses. Have a climax where your two main characters climb a tall structure to stage a dramatic shootout, thereby symbolising moral jeopardy, and also the climbing of tall structures. Above all remember that every successful Hollywood movie can basically be summarised with the phrase “Daddy, I love you”, from Casablanca to Star Wars to Top Gun.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/30/hard-nosed-liverpool-hold-firm-on-sa

I stood on the shore beside the geographically fascinating <a href="https://englandscoast.com/en/listing/stair-hole-jurassic-coast">Stair Hole</a> and shouted: “Candice Marie, you are standing on sedimentary limestone!” To which Linda, who had walked up to the top of the cliff, duly replied: “I can’t hear you, Keith.” After which we went to Corfe Castle and had a theatrical row about who got to hold the guidebook before going in search of the dungeons.</p><p>To be clear, this was no marital tiff – rather, it was a reenactment of one of our favourite movies, Mike Leigh’s <strong><a href="https://archive.org/details/nuts-in-may-1976">Nuts in May</a></strong> (Internet Archive).

Then we have to cover the “MPs on television” caveats: Matt Hancock shouldn’t have been allowed to reform his image on I’m a Celebrity, Farage shouldn’t have been either, and while I’m at it I don’t like Ed Balls on Good Morning Britain.

Recently, however, I tried making it with just the orange peel instead of the whole fruit – and what a revelation! Why use the entire orange when you can just make use of a byproduct instead? After all, it’s the bitter rind that gives this cake its wonderful depth of flavour, so it makes total sense.</p><p>This cake is a true showstopper, especially when adorned with pomegranate seeds and pistachios, which give it a beautiful, festive colour. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/sep/28/claudia-rodens-orange-and-almond-cake">Claudia Roden’s classic recipe</a> for orange polenta cake uses the whole fruit, but this version using just the peel tastes as delightfu
