The wreck, found in 2013, lies on a coral reef approximately 500 meters from the shore and is believed to have sunk over 500 years ago. Artifacts retrieved from the site, including elephant tusks and copper ingots, suggest the ship\u2019s Portuguese origins. The team, composed of researchers from the University of Coimbra, the National Museum of Kenya, and the Bergen Maritime Museum, has been carefully studying the wreck and its surrounding area to confirm its identity. If the S\u00e3o Jorge is confirmed, it would provide significant insight into early 16th-century maritime history.",
