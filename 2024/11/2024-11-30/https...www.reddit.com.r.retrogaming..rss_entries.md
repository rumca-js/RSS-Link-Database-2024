<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So this is gonna sound weird.</p> <p>A few years ago i found 2 games on PSN, those games were GYNOUG and GLAY LANCER, both megadrive games that are lesser known and obscure enough for them not to be on any sega collection.</p> <p>Thing is, i had great fun with them, especailly during december , so i am asking, does anyone know lesser popular games of the 16 bit on psn ? like genesis or pc engine ? nothing common, i know them all, but GLAY LANCER ? who the heck even knew this game exists ? and Gynoug was a huge surprise of how good it was, anw, if anyone can help, BUT PLEASE, don&#39;t go saying MONSTER BOY, SONIC, ZOMBIES ATE MY NEIGHBORS, GARGOYLES....i mean something really cult classic and off the grid like these 2 games.</p> <p>Anw, it might be interesting to purchase GARGOYLES this year, but waiting for a %50 discount, the new graphics are bad but u can play it with original graphics and that is great.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by

I wnat a new device a small one preferably powerfull and small and with ability to connect to the TV and Bluetooth controller... Preferably... I have in mind, rg35xxsp, rg28xx, trimui brick, xu mini m (or wait for m+), also i know rgb30 and rgb20sx are not small but man the square screen is so tempting. Yes small miyoo mini is probably the ideal EDC option but I already have Miyoo mini+ and want something different. So...
