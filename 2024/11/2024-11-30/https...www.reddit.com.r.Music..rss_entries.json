        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Looking for the name of this song, I can\u2019t even remember the lyrics but there\u2019s just a part of it playing in my head and it\u2019s on the tip of my tongue. The band sounds a bit like the following: the bare naked ladies, smash mouth, bowling for soup, the offspring. In the song it sounds like a bunch of men are singing in a very \u201cmatter of fact\u201d way if that makes sense. It\u2019s a pretty fast paced with lots of instruments playing at a fast beat in the background. I feel like he says something like :\u201dwell I guess that\u2019s what I get\u201d or \u201cI haven\u2019t had to yet\u201d at the chorus, and the music kind of quiets down when he says that. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the actual lyric though because I can\u2019t find it when I google it, but it\u2019s something along those lines. </p> <p>I sound crazy trying to explain it lol, I hope someone out there will know what song I\u2019m talking about\ud83d\ude05. I believe it was released in the 90\u2019s or early 2000\u2019s. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#3",

Question is, which bands most popular song is actually some of their best/their best?</p> <p>My throw in is chop suey by system of a down, I love system and own a lot of their music, they&#39;re pretty unique and one of a kind in my eyes. I&#39;ve listened to every song they&#39;ve put out and still, I think chop suey is their best. It&#39;s just amazing, the production is on point, the ideas being presented and executed feel very unique and fresh and the mix of that heavy sound and softer just blend well (as they do in most system songs).</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Dense-Performance-14\"> /u/Dense-Performance-14 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1h32ede/what_bands_most_p",
