It&#39;s certainly well-written, but not the kind of story I can get into at this point in my life. I&#39;m wondering if they&#39;re all so dreary?</p> <p>For those who may not remember, the plot is: <span class=\"md-spoiler-text\">The protagonist goes on a few adventures with people and civilizations that die soon after. Then he fails his mission and dies. The antagonist is so depressed about &quot;winning&quot; that she kills herself. The epilogue shows all the events of the book were pointless. The author said it&#39;s an anti-war theme, which I can respect, but you have to be in the right mindset to read (or watch) an &quot;everyone loses&quot; story like that.</span></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Thalassicus1\"> /u/Thalassicus1 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/bo",

I was a little intrigued by the premise, but my god was this book boring. The main characters grow up in an abusive orphanage together, something that colors literally all of their actions/interactions with each other, but we barely get to see what actually happened there. Instead, we get nearly 600 pages of, well, nothing. The chapters are incredibly repetitive, and drag on and on for no reason. The narration, which is usually in first-person, is pretentious and, again, repetitive. I want to excuse some of this, because I assume the translation from Italian to English was not perfect, but that does not excuse the way the main character is only able to",

Aristotle&#39;s phrase formed itself within the gabbled verses and floated out into the studious silence of the library of Sainte Genevi\u00e8ve where he had read, sheltered from the sin of Paris, night by night. By his elbow a delicate Siamese conned a handbook of strategy. Fed and feeding brains about me: under glowlamps, impaled, with faintly beating feelers: and in my mind&#39;s darkness a sloth of the underworld, reluctant, shy of brightness, shifting her dragon scaly folds. Thought is the thought of thought. Tranquil brightness. The soul is in a manner all that is: the soul is the form of forms. Tranquility sudden, vast, candescent: form of forms.</p> </blockquote> <p>Some chapters get easier but then we&#39;re back to this.</p> <p>I was having troubl",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I recently read Napoleon&#39;s essay &#39;On Suicide,&#39; written when he was 17. In this essay, Napoleon contemplates death and expresses deep despair, feeling isolated and unable to find meaning in life. He reflects on his alienation from his homeland and his growing frustration with the world around him. He even goes as far as to contemplate suicide as an escape from his misery. At this time, young Napoleon harbored strong anti-French sentiments, influenced by his identity as a Corsican and his resentment towards the French government, which he viewed as an oppressor. This anti-French outlook, combined with his personal anguish, shaped much of his early writings.</p> <p>But, honestly, I don&#39;t think Bonaparte was seriously contemplating suicide. It\u2019s more likely that he was dealing with sexual repression. Shortly after writing this essay, he met his first love, and\u2014surprise\u2014his mood seemed to lift. The depression and suicidal thoughts vanished",

I last read it when I was about their age and really enjoyed it, but going through it again with a more analytical perspective there are some things I&#39;m left really wondering about. The main thing is the idea of empathy being Ender&#39;s key to defeating his opponents. We&#39;re told this several times throughout the book, and we definitely see some scenes of him being highly empathetic, but I don&#39;t really see it come into play in terms of him being able to defeat his enemies.</p> <p><span class=\"md-spoiler-text\">In the fights he has with Stilson and Bonzo he&#39;s able to goad them into fighting one on one, and a case could be made that he needs a degree of empathy in order to be able to successfully do that, but the entire rest of the time he&#39;s at the Battle School does he use empathy at all to win his battle",
