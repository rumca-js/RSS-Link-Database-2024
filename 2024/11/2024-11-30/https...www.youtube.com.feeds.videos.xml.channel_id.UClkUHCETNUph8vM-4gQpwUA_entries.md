Path of Exile 2 Gameplay Impressions Early Access REVIEW - Is it the BEST ARPG of ALL TIME?
In this Path of Exile 2 video, I want to talk about my hands-on impressions with the game. I Just wrapped up the main campaign today. After about 35-40 hours estimate of playtime. I want to talk about what i think about the game. What I like about it, What I don't like about it so far and keep in mind as i go through this review as well, that this is from the perspective of a non hardcore Path of Exile player.
