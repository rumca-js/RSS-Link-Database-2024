        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Currently working on a c++ side project to get a better understanding of Linear Algebra. The project is essentially a matrix calculator where it does your typical addition and multiplication as well as REF &amp; RREF as well as some other stuff. </p> <p>Currently Im storing a matrix as a 2d vector that contains floating values. However im wondering if there is a better way to represent a matrix in c++ that doesn&#39;t result in O(n<sup>2)</sup> time to navigate through it.</p> <p>Currently have implemented all row operations and matrix multiplication functionality in the project. Wondering to get some advice before I commit with 2d vectors.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Benimaru_Shapiro\"> /u/Benimaru_Shapiro </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1h3kurb/best_way_to_store_matrices/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments",
