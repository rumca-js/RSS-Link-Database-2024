He has been operating on the periphery of consciousness back home but this was some way to illuminate one of Europe\u2019s showpiece occasions. Gittens is only 20 and coming into his own four years after arriving at Borussia Dortmund. His electrifying solo goal before the half-hour seemed to have settled a high-octane clash until Jamal Musiala glanced an equaliser five minutes from the end and maintained Bayern Munich\u2019s unbeaten record.</p><p>Musiala maintained a 10-point gap between the bitter rivals and, more broadly, dampened the sense of an impending Bundesliga title race. The disappointment for Bayern lay in a first-half injury to Harry Kane, which will raise antennae in England too. At least Gittens, whose senior debut cannot be far off, could delight any watching emissaries.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/30/borussia-dortmund-bayern-munich-der-klassiker-bundesliga-match-report\">Cont",

The Minneapolis-based artist and writer\u2019s bright watercolour vignettes of city life have now been collected into an expanded edition of the illustrated memoir he first published in 2015. \u201cParis is special in winter because there are fewer tourists and the city is more intimate, more itself,\u201d he says. \u201cDinners are elaborate. And Parisian fashion is at its height \u2013 people wear beautiful layered clothes.\u201d In addition to his wife, Wendy, and their children David and Sarah, Coggins enjoys painting \u201cthe witty, romantic life of Parisians.

It\u2019s an ever-expanding universe. Night shots of the thronged streets in this exquisite, Cannes prize-winning drama by Mumbai-born documentary director turned fiction film-maker Payal Kapadia show the skyline as a shimmering constellation of lights. And behind each flickering window, inside every snaking commuter train, there is a whole world with its own myriad of stories. It\u2019s an idea that Kapadia acknowledges with elegant simplicity at the film\u2019s opening, using documentary techniques, a montage of street scenes and the voices of migrants from around the country drawn to the city for work.</p><p>Having captured the teeming collision of lives, she gently guides us to follow three of them.

In 2021, Troy published Redemption: My Story, a memoir about his upbringing and his turbulent relationship with his adoptive father, Paul.
