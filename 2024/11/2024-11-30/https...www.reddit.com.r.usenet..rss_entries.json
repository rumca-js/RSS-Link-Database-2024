I&#39;m using Hogwasher to browse binaries via Eweka (maybe this isn&#39;t the &quot;best&quot; way to do it, but it&#39;s the way that seems most familiar/similar to me from my experience 35 years ago).</p> <p>I see that in, for instance, alt.binaries.movies, the posts are all obfuscated--they come from some hex <a href=\"mailto:string@ngPost.com\">string@ngPost.com</a>, and the subject is some random alphanumeric string. I&#39;ve tried to do research online and figure out how to be able to de-obfuscate these, but I guess my brain isn&#39;t comprehending it. If someone can give me a poke in the right direction I can probably figure out the rest :) thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.c",
