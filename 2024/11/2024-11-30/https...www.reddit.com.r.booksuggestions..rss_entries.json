She has currently read the entire bibliography of Sarah j. Maas (loved), Leigh Bardugo (fine with), V.E. Swchabb (REALLY loved), The Dresden Files (REALLY REALLY LOVED) as well as things like the Fourth Wing books, some of The Magician series (hated it), The Winternight trilogy, a bunch of Alice Hoffman, and lots of one-offs that were myth retellings. </p> <p>She really loved In The Name of The Wind as well. </p> <p>The issue that she has is that a lot of the genre seems to be catering to YA and she doesn&#39;t &quot;give a shit if the elf king wants to fuck you or not, stop pouting.&quot; So a series with perhaps an older protagonist or more mature writing style might be up her alley. </p> <p>Are there any deeper cuts in the ",

I was wondering if there are books that don&#39;t just look at a specific idea or a specific story like Jim Crow, but rather foundationally why we should move towards a more progressive society, the benefits, or why it&#39;s okay to care about marginalized people and understand their issues. </p> <p>Thank you.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/NigerianPrince1242\"> /u/NigerianPrince1242 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1h3n5oa/books_that_justify_social_justice/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1h3n5oa/books_tha",

I\u02bcm starting to lose hope and the idea of interviews and job hunting is starting to creep in and is giving me anxiety. I need something that would motivate me or help me think about life and my purpose, and all I could think about is reading. Any kind suggestions? I would appreciate it.

She goes on to describe an interaction between them in excruciating detail, whines about how her sister had her dream child and so many other weird things... That&#39;s the fourth holiday themed book I tried with an open mind and ended up DNF-ing. So please, please save me from this torment and provide holiday book recs that don&#39;t suck!</p> <p>Thanks in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/bnw1234\"> ",
