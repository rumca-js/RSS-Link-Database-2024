I played with a bunch (Railway, Hetzner, Digital Ocean) and found that the PostgreSQL databases &amp; S3 storage buckets each have their own cost, separate from the cost of hosting the web app. On Digital Ocean, I believe it&#39;s $15 for a managed database, $5 for an S3 bucket, and $3 just to run the server. $23 a month is nearing the yearly budget.</p> <p>The organization I created the portal for is fairly large but doesn&#39;t receive any government grants or subsidies. They&#39;re looking for the lowest monthly cost possible and only use the portal several times per year.
