<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>As the title says: I&#39;ve been getting into the holiday spirit &amp; watching videos on YT to find Christmas-y book recs that sound interesting (romance, thriller, horror, etc.) but it seems that bad writing is a requirement for a Christmas themed book.</p> <p>Started reading The Plight Before Christmas (after a YT recommended it) then the author spent about 5 pages describing the main character&#39;s nephew and how, even though she has three nieces, he&#39;s her favorite ‚Äòcause he‚Äôs a boy! She goes on to describe an interaction between them in excruciating detail, whines about how her sister had her dream child and so many other weird things... That&#39;s the fourth holiday themed book I tried with an open mind and ended up DNF-ing. So please, please save me from this torment and provide holiday book recs that don&#39;t suck!</p> <p>Thanks in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/bnw1234">
