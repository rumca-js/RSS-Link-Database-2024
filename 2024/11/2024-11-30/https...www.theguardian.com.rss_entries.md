<p>No Arsenal player is benefiting more from the captain’s return than his ruthless buddy on the wing, as West Ham found out</p><p>Oh for heavens’s sake, get a room. Actually don’t.

<p>Every tiny moment of darts’ ascendance to an even higher level – and the birth of a superstar – is captured in this retrospective of last year’s world championship. Also there are men in fancy dress as chickens</p><p>Is darts the best sport in the world? If it isn’t, it’s certainly a heavyweight contender and it’s bang in form, with the coming of the current golden age confirmed during the extraordinary 2024 PDC World Championship. Game of Throws, a three-part reminiscence about those three dramatic weeks in London a year ago, successfully bottles the moment.</p><p>More of a collective mania than a game, darts asks participants to throw tiny metal spikes at targets the width of a fingertip from more than two metres away, a ludicrously difficult discipline that requires years of diligent practice. Wins and losses are measured in millimetres. So one might expect elite tournaments to take place in a reverential hush, like chess or snooker. But no: the major career landmarks of darts

<p>An extraordinary sense of a club imploding is taking hold and the champions’ title rivals have the chance to make it worse</p><p>On 30 January 2015, Bayern Munich lost in the Bundesliga for the first time that season, going down 4-1 at Wolfsburg. Pep Guardiola was worried. They had dropped six points in the first 17 league games and the title was almost certainly theirs already, but Wolfsburg, inspired by Kevin De Bruyne, had picked them off on the counter.</p><p>The space Guardiola’s teams leave behind the high defensive line had always been a vulnerability, could not but be a vulnerability, but something had gone wrong with the press, allowing Wolfsburg freedom.

<p>It cannot be long until English audiences learn Jamie Gittens’s name. He has been operating on the periphery of consciousness back home but this was some way to illuminate one of Europe’s showpiece occasions. Gittens is only 20 and coming into his own four years after arriving at Borussia Dortmund. His electrifying solo goal before the half-hour seemed to have settled a high-octane clash until Jamal Musiala glanced an equaliser five minutes from the end and maintained Bayern Munich’s unbeaten record.</p><p>Musiala maintained a 10-point gap between the bitter rivals and, more broadly, dampened the sense of an impending Bundesliga title race. The disappointment for Bayern lay in a first-half injury to Harry Kane, which will raise antennae in England too. At least Gittens, whose senior debut cannot be far off, could delight any watching emissaries.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/30/borussia-dortmund-bayern-munich-der-klassiker-bundesliga-match-report">Cont

<p>If Manchester City’s wobbles hearten for Arsenal, Liverpool’s blindside run to the top has maintained the margin for error. Will Mikel Arteta end up counting the cost of Martin Ødegaard’s absence? Nobody can doubt the playmaker’s importance and the improvement his return has brought even if this London derby win may be best recalled for the proficiency of Arsenal’s set pieces.</p><p>West Ham’s manner of defeat, particularly in a goal-deluged first half, puts the pressure back on Julen Lopetegui. Victory at Newcastle had been well-executed, in the nick of the time, but public opinion now swings back against him. Those seeking creativity, freedom of expression and enjoyment may be better advised to attend the Abba Arena shown elsewhere on the Stratford campus. Or watching Arsenal. And if Hammers fans have always appreciated shows grit, it was only briefly in evidence.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/30/west-ham-arsenal-premier-league-match-report">Continue

<p>Despite defeat against Ireland, recent progress shows what is possible – and that the Wallabies have the right coach</p><p>The last time Australia won in Dublin, in November 2013, Joe Schmidt was sitting in the other coaching box having just taken control of an Ireland team in disarray.

Having steered Leinster to back-to-back Heineken Cup wins, Schmidt was tasked with converting domestic dominance into global supremacy.</p><p>His first assignment against tier-one opposition was the visit of the Wallabies. After a “performance without spirit, urgency, or accuracy,” as the Observer’s Eddie Butler concluded, Ireland were spanked 32-15.

<ul><li>Northampton 17-25 Gloucester</li><li>Santi Carreras confounds Saints’ comeback hopes</li></ul><p>We may have been denied the consummation of another comeback from the dead, but we were treated to the usual entertainment all the same. Northampton’s struggles continue, here surrendering a 17-match unbeaten run at home. Gloucester, though, after an exhilarating opening 40 minutes move ever closer to the playoff zone with a win high on charisma and grit.</p><p>Rory Hutchinson missed a late penalty for the Saints, which would have earned them a bonus point, but the champions could not recover from the boundless energy with which Gloucester ran them ragged in the first half. Both sides chucked the ball around with abandon, often to their own players, but quite often to the opposition. It just added to the breathlessness.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/nov/30/northampton-gloucester-premiership-rugby-union-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Bournemouth’s Justin Kluivert became the first player in Premier League history to score a hat-trick of penalties as he inspired a win at Wolves. The home goalkeeper José Sá, who gave away two of the spot-kicks, confronted angry supporters at half-time as the home side’s recent revival was brought to an abrupt halt.</p><p>It was a manic afternoon at Molineux which featured four goals in the opening 18 minutes, with Kluivert scoring twice from the spot either side of Milos Kerkez’s goal. Jørgen Strand Larsen had made it 1-1 and then 3-2 but the Dutchman’s third penalty of the game secured the win for the Cherries.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/30/wolves-bournemouth-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

## Muñoz’s late header rescues draw for Crystal Palace against Newcastle

<p>It was the moment Oliver Glasner had been praying for on an afternoon when nothing had seemed to go his way. With Crystal Palace staring down the barrel of another costly defeat courtesy of Marc Guéhi’s own goal against the club that had tried so hard to sign him in the summer, a late equaliser from Daniel Muñoz changed everything. Glasner was off down the touchline, pumping his fists to the home supporters in pure delight and no doubt relief.</p><p>With seconds of injury time to play, Newcastle must have thought they had done enough to see off Palace despite not mustering a shot on target. But it was Muñoz, who had somehow contrived to miss a sitter when Palace were in total control during the first half, who came to Glasner’s rescue when he headed home Guéhi’s cross and lifted Palace out of the bottom three.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/30/crystal-palace-newcastle-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>No one can blame Ben Dawson for attempting to try something different in his first and only game in charge of Leicester. The interim manager named a very different side at Brentford, in shape and personnel, as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/29/leicester-confirm-ruud-van-nistelrooy-manager-appointment">the incoming Ruud van Nistelrooy</a> watched from the stands. Unfortunately for him, Kevin Schade’s incredible hat-trick at the Gtech not only inflicted more misery on the visitors, who remain one point above the relegation zone, but proved their problems will require more than a simple formation change.</p><p>Brentford almost scored within five minutes after Schade’s looping header was palmed on to the roof of the net by a leaping Mads Hermansen. Leicester were pinned back but Dawson’s decision to name a back three left the box overcrowded and Bryan Mbeumo’s seven crosses in the first half were all met with a blue shirt.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.c

<p>After falling in love with Paris’s art, architecture and style, David Coggins and his family have been heading there for their winter holidays since the mid-1990s. The Minneapolis-based artist and writer’s bright watercolour vignettes of city life have now been collected into an expanded edition of the illustrated memoir he first published in 2015. “Paris is special in winter because there are fewer tourists and the city is more intimate, more itself,” he says. “Dinners are elaborate. And Parisian fashion is at its height – people wear beautiful layered clothes.” In addition to his wife, Wendy, and their children David and Sarah, Coggins enjoys painting “the witty, romantic life of Parisians. A waiter in a long white apron having a smoke break, a dog sporting a Chanel sweater, a woman wearing an umbrella hat.”</p><ul><li><em><a href="https://powerhousebooks.com/books/paris-in-winter-2024/">Paris in Winter: An Illustrated Memoir</a></em><a href="https://powerhousebooks.com/books/pa
