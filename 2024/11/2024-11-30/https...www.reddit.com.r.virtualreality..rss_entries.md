I haven’t contacted valve support about it, but I know they are likely going to tell me to purchase a replacement cable which is expensive. The quest 3 is starting to look like a solid option due to its ability to take advantage of my pc’s graphics card and vr library, plus the idea of being able to take the headset anywhere with me and play it without being connected to a pc or even connected wirelessly to my pc is incredibly enticing, however, then I will have two tracking stations and two controllers, and a headset not doing me much good. I also know that the quest 3 will be a bit of a step down with its controllers and tracking, although that’s not doing me much good now with me having to use my

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey!<br/> A couple of months ago it came up in a discussion with a friend that he couldn&#39;t easily find AR VR related jobs, he got his first job in the field thanks to an internship while he was still a student, but now it was time for a change. Since I enjoy building side projects I decided to make a job board for this particular field. </p> <p>I think it can be hard to only rely on the keywords &quot;AR&quot; &quot;VR&quot; &quot;Virtual Reality&quot; etc. so I spent some time researching interesting companies and I will keep researching to be able to offer a better selection. I was a bit surprised by the wide range of skills that can be covered: from game development, to hardware/embedded to web development, to 3D design, so it seems like there are many opportunities for people with many different backgrounds!</p> <p>Anyways hope this will be useful to someone else besides my friend!</p> <p><a href="https://www.arvrjobs.dev/">AR VR Jobs</a></p>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>It’s been maybe 2 and something months since I took the dive and ordered my first and only headset, a barely used Quest 3 that I ended up getting on a recommendation, eg. discount price since my haggle skills were on point that day. A couple of days, maybe a week later and it becomes one of my key obsessions that I couldn’t stop bragging about to whoever asked me about “how was it?” What can I say except that it was, forgive the pun, almost a <em>game-changing event</em>. It was always something I observed from the periphery, like listening to news about a new Iphone coming out or something to that effect. Nah, this was quite literally an reality enhancement device that amped up my immersion in any media, games and movies both, to unimaginable degrees. </p> <p>The first movie I watched was Matrix (haha), it just seemed so appropriate. And it was like watching the movie as it was intended, but COULDN’T be watched all those years ago. So much more imme

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So when I say children I&#39;m takling early-mid teens and younger. I&#39;m not saying kick them all from VR but maybe put up some restrictions. Take VRChat as an example, anyone can go into any public world with any avatar, if you have played VRChat for more than 10 mins. you know that there are tons of NSFW avatars, most of which have free access to all controls/settings. </p> <p>Then there is any multiplayer action game, like Ghosts of Tabor, Tactical Assult VR, Population one (to a certian extent as that game could be considered to be made for children) where children have no sense of respect or sportsmanship. yes I am aware that last part could be chalked up to them just being kids with a mind that wont be fully developed for atleast another 10 years.</p> <p>Then there is the hangout spaces like meta worlds that are basically a digital daycare. It wouldn&#39;t take much for an individual with bad intentions to enter a space like this, and it is 

## Why is VR so relatively immature still? (Speaking as an enthusiast, but also as a cautiously interested software developer)

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I&#39;ve been loosely following what&#39;s going on in this space for a while. I had a Rift S a few years ago when it was still Oculus and just got a Quest 3 yesterday. </p> <p>One of the first things that blew me away yesterday was just the room calibration for MR. Watching the mesh accurately capture the surfaces of the room I was in was really impressive. I was immediately reeling with the ideas of what cool things you could do with that. Yet, when I look through various available apps, it doesn&#39;t seem significantly more developed than back when I was messing around with the Rift S. Few things are doing anything really impressive with that. Maybe if I dig deeper I can find interesting things, but the fact that I&#39;d have to dig deeper at all prompts these questions.</p> <p>Back then I remember messing with <a href="http://aframe.io">aframe.io</a> to build things, but it didn&#39;t seem like it was really taking off with developers enough
