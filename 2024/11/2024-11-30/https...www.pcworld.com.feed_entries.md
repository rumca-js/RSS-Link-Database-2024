<p>Having a power bank on hand is always useful if your phone’s battery is running low. Well, this super-discounted Anker 737 power bank has enough juice not only to recharge your phone but also your laptop. The best thing is that <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-PowerCore-Portable-Charger-Compatible/dp/B09VPHVT2Z/">it’s on sale for $74</a>, down from its $150 MSRP.</p>



<p>The power bank has a massive 24,000mAh capacity, which is about enough to charge your phone about four times fully and still have some power left.</p>

<p>I love Black Friday component deals. You can combo-chain them to build yourself a gaming PC much cheaper than usual—no matter what resolution you’re playing at. During the rest of the year, you can find bargains, but it’s harder to pull together a full system (much less a kickass one) at the same prices.</p>

And as a bonus for this year, this build packs a powerful CPU and lots of memory. All without any hijinx: The parts are new and sold by major retailers.</p>



<p>More interested in 1440p gaming, or scaling down to a more modest gaming build? I’ve got suggested builds for those scenarios, too—and they may surprise you. </p>
