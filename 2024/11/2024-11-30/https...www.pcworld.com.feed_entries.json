You can combo-chain them to build yourself a gaming PC much cheaper than usual\u2014no matter what resolution you\u2019re playing at. During the rest of the year, you can find bargains, but it\u2019s harder to pull together a full system (much less a kickass one) at the same prices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2024, it turns out that despite rising SSD costs and slowed graphics card releases, you can still put together an upgradable gaming PC capable of 1080p High or Ultra at 60fps for just $550. And as a bonus for this year, this build packs a powerful CPU and lots of memory. All without any hijinx: The parts are new and sold by major retailers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More interested in 1440p gaming, or scaling down to a more modest gaming build? I\u2019ve got suggested builds for those scenarios, too\u2014and they may surprise you.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s dive in.</p>\n\n\n\n<blo",
