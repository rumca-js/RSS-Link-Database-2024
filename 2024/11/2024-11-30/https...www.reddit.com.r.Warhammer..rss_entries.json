Anyhow I bought him it but do you guys think this is a good gift or since it isn\u2019t part of his regular army I probably shouldn\u2019t have. I only did because I figured it could give him a fun and subtle start into using those as well.

He\u2019s a big Ultramarine Fan and builds them quite often. What do I get him\u2026? I\u2019d buy him a mini set but he\u2019s backed up on them. Still open to that tho. What paint sets does warhammer even need? I heard him say he wants an airbrush perhaps for them\u2026? I\u2019m all open for suggestions and links.</p> <p>TLDR; what paint set or airbrushes do you guys use to paint them?
