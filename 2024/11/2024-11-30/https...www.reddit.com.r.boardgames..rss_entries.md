<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I remember hearing about this board game, but I am not able to find its name. It’s something close to a social trick taking game where players fill in cards and assign values to them.</p> <p>The game goes something like this: players secretly fill cards for some topic, for example favorite movies, and assign values to those cards. Then players either mix those cards together and deal them or maybe just take a set of cards filled by another player. Players do not know the value of the cards, they basically have to guess it based on each other’s likes and dislikes. </p> <p>With cards dealt out they play either something similar to a trick taking game or just everyone plays a card and the high card wins. I think there was also a twist there where the lowest card wins against the highest.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/WanderingFool15"> /u/WanderingFool15 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit

He is really smart (for his age), and often watches The Chase and manages to answer a lot of the questions. He loves board/quiz games, and plays them often with his grandmother.</p> <p>I found two different board/quiz games that I feel would be suited to him, but I&#39;m not quite sure. Below are my options:</p> <p><strong>Ginger Fox Kids vs Adults Fun-for-All Trivia Card Game</strong></p> <p><strong>IDEAL | The Chase game: The Chase is on!| Family TV Show Board Game</strong></p> <p>On one hand the Kids vs Adults one I know for a fact would be suited to him, as it has questions specifically for kids. On the other hand I can imagine he&#39;d be a lot happier with The Chase one because he&#39;s almost obsessed with it, but I worry that the questions may end up being too hard for him and it&#39;s more of an adult game.</p> <p>Can you guys recommend either/or for me please?

If team 1 had players A B and C, they could select the order, but they have to keep naming things in that order (obviously no discussing answers beforehand). If one player gave an incorrect clue the team didn’t get any points. Alternatively, the team could choose to stop in the middle of the round to save the points they had made so far.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>*where better means better in my opinio as it adds some quality of life features that are not present on other websites and generally makes it more user friendly. You people are the judges, you can disagree with me (and if you do please leave a constructive comment!!!!!)</p> <p>This version is lobby based to allow players to play over voice calls, you can just create a lobby and type a code, among-us style.</p> <p>This is my first project making a game with a frontend &amp; backend, so it was a big learning experience. I often play with my friends but other than my group it doesn&#39;t have that much traffic, so I&#39;d love to get some feedback from you!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/derewah"> /u/derewah </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://spyfall.derewah.dev/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1h304ys/i_made_a_better_website_for_spyfall/">[comme
