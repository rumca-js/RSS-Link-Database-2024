        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Ive came across 4 raspberry pi&#39;s and i have a couple desktops with gpu&#39;s that im using as a linux servers atm. Im wondering how could i maybe for example setup a ffuf cluster with the pi&#39;s. Would it call for using say kubernetis? What other ideas would be good for the use of multiple many computers when it comes to web/app pen testing. Ive setup the desktops to be able to crack hash&#39;s from a cheeky little flask server and poorly coded python. I want all the pi&#39;s to work as one though i want it to be like a load balancer and i dont know what program would be best for that with my use cases</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Ok-Establishment1343\"> /u/Ok-Establishment1343 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking_Tutorials/comments/1h3lkjt/ideas_for_the_use_of_a_pi_cluster_for_bug/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking_Tutorials/co",
