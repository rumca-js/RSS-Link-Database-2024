I’d love to hear thoughts on what it would have been like if Marley and hill were alive at the same time and really made music together not just a studio remix. I’m on a Marley and hill kick so lets hear your thoughts please;) Also any and all other music by either of them is up for discussion too. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ru-by-ruby"> /u/ru-by-ruby </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1h3p1w8/what_do_you_think_of_the_remix_lauryn_hill_did_of/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1h3p1w8/what_do_you_think_of_the_remix_lauryn_hill_did_of/">[comments]</a></span>

My name is Rachel, and I’m Matt Pelissier’s wife (he was the original drummer for My Chemical Romance). When we learned this morning that Bob had passed away, it brought up a lot of memories from the past.</p> <p>For those who don’t know, Bob first worked with The Used as their sound engineer and met MCR when they toured together. I had the chance to meet Bob a few times when he’d hang out with Matt, and we’d make some small talk. He always said he wasn’t much of a people person, but he had a deep love for animals—especially dogs. Bob did a lot of good work for animal rescues, and I think he deserves a lot of respect for that.</p> <p>As many of you know, Bob eventually started practicing with MCR when they were considering replacing Matt. Matt and Bob were never really close, so there wasn’t any personal animosity there. And let’s be honest—if a famous band asks you to be the

And where much of it was recorded.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Looking for the name of this song, I can’t even remember the lyrics but there’s just a part of it playing in my head and it’s on the tip of my tongue. The band sounds a bit like the following: the bare naked ladies, smash mouth, bowling for soup, the offspring. In the song it sounds like a bunch of men are singing in a very “matter of fact” way if that makes sense. It’s a pretty fast paced with lots of instruments playing at a fast beat in the background. I feel like he says something like :”well I guess that’s what I get” or “I haven’t had to yet” at the chorus, and the music kind of quiets down when he says that. I don’t think that’s the actual lyric though because I can’t find it when I google it, but it’s something along those lines. </p> <p>I sound crazy trying to explain it lol, I hope someone out there will know what song I’m talking about😅. I believe it was released in the 90’s or early 2000’s. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#3

I have ticket stubs, but it doesn’t stand out to me at all. It was about the 5th time of seeing them, according to my review on Facebook probably the worst time I’d seen them, but genuinely cannot picture any of it in my minds eye. Looking up the setlist didn’t help either. </p> <p>So who do you not remember seeing, despite all the evidence to the contrary?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/brewer01902"> /u/brewer01902 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1h38eo5/who_do_you_have_physical_evidence_youve_seen_live/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1h38eo5/who_do_you_have_physical_evidence_youve_seen_live/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Title is self explanatory, most bands most popular songs are usually considered overrated by the fanbase/overplayed or very palatable and therefore not as interesting as their more niche work. Question is, which bands most popular song is actually some of their best/their best?</p> <p>My throw in is chop suey by system of a down, I love system and own a lot of their music, they&#39;re pretty unique and one of a kind in my eyes. I&#39;ve listened to every song they&#39;ve put out and still, I think chop suey is their best. It&#39;s just amazing, the production is on point, the ideas being presented and executed feel very unique and fresh and the mix of that heavy sound and softer just blend well (as they do in most system songs).</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Dense-Performance-14"> /u/Dense-Performance-14 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1h32ede/what_bands_most_p
