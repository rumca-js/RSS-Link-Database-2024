Spider-Man meets the one person he hates the most, and then a few more of him. Madame Web must convince the Spider-Men from all across the multiverse to fight an evil force who is also them so it’s kinda full circle. Isn't it kinda cool that this was the first spider-man story like this? Like, this is before even the comics began to milk the multiverse thing. Even kinda predicted Superior Spider-Man somewhat.
