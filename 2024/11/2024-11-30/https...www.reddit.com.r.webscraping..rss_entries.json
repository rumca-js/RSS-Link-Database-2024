The forum is offline, but available publicly only through the Wayback Machine. Many data points were deleted and are no longer directly accessible. I need to recover as much data as possible. Additionally, I need to try to identify where the data was originally stored and explore possible methods to recover it, even if it&#39;s not directly accessible via the Wayback Machine. The goal is to restore as much content as possible, especially the front-end part of the forum, which is crucial for analysis. If you have experience with this type of data recovery, please get in touch.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/No-Persimmon3365\"> /u/No-Persimmon3365 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1h3p2qd/freelancer_web_scraper/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; ",
