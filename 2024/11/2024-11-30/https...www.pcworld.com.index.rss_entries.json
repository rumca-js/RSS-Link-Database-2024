A lot of laptops can be found at a hearty discount, but some retailers tout big savings that aren\u2019t really savings at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s where I come in (cue the majestic trumpets)! I\u2019ve been overseeing PCWorld\u2019s laptop reviews operation for years, helping our team evaluate hundreds and hundreds of notebooks of all shapes, sizes, and price points. I\u2019ve compiled a list of worthwhile laptop deals from all over the web, from laptop manufacturers like Dell and Acer, as well as sales from online retailers like Best Buy and B&H. Not all Black Friday laptop deals are truly deals, but the hand-curated ones I\u2019ve selected below certainly are. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"black-friday-m",

Usually available for $110, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Arzopa-Portable-100-SRGB-External-Speakers/dp/B093GCL18V/\">this 15.6\u2033 Arzopa portable monitor is down to $57 at Amazon</a> for Prime members.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First of all, the monitor is light and slim, measuring just 1.7 lbs and 0.35 inches thick, so it will fit right next to your laptop. It also comes with a cover that doubles as a kickstand, so the screen is always protected.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The IPS display delivers 1080p images with bright colors and deep contrasts. That makes this Arzopa monitor ideal not just for writing that presentation you have to deliver by the end of the week but also for streaming content, doom-scrolling, or watching grainy l",

The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Beelink-SER5-Graphics-Computer-Support/dp/B0C2P486GQ/?th=1\">Beelink SER5 Mini PC, for instance, is down to $299 right now</a>, a solid 23% under its $389 MSRP at Amazon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what makes this particular tiny computer so good? Well, first of all, it\u2019s super powerful despite its size. Running on an AMD Ryzen 7 5800H processor and 16GB of DDR4 RAM, this is a device that can tackle anything you want, from your workload to streaming to gaming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Should you feel the need for more oomph, the RAM can be upgraded to 64GB, which shouldn\u2019t cost a lot considering its DDR4. Whether you do or don\u2019t, you\u2019re going to have a lag-free experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The mini PC comes ",

You can combo-chain them to build yourself a gaming PC much cheaper than usual\u2014no matter what resolution you\u2019re playing at. During the rest of the year, you can find bargains, but it\u2019s harder to pull together a full system (much less a kickass one) at the same prices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2024, it turns out that despite rising SSD costs and slowed graphics card releases, you can still put together an upgradable gaming PC capable of 1080p High or Ultra at 60fps for just $550. And as a bonus for this year, this build packs a powerful CPU and lots of memory. All without any hijinx: The parts are new and sold by major retailers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More interested in 1440p gaming, or scaling down to a more modest gaming build? I\u2019ve got suggested builds for those scenarios, too\u2014and they may surprise you.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s dive in.</p>\n\n\n\n<blo",
