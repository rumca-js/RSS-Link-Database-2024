NASA’s satellite images have captured the ongoing volcanic eruption near Iceland's Blue Lagoon. The eruption, which started on 20 November, caused lava to flow from a fissure, with the nearby Blue Lagoon spa and Grindavík being evacuated. The infrared visuals reveal lava glowing brighter than Reykjavík. While the eruption is ongoing, lava flow has slowed since the initial event.

An international team of archaeologists is investigating a shipwreck discovered off the coast of Malindi, Kenya, which may be the remains of the São Jorge, a Portuguese galleon linked to Vasco da Gama's final voyage. The wreck, found in 2013, lies on a coral reef approximately 500 meters from the shore and is believed to have sunk over 500 years ago. Artifacts retrieved from the site, including elephant tusks and copper ingots, suggest the ship’s Portuguese origins. The team, composed of researchers from the University of Coimbra, the National Museum of Kenya, and the Bergen Maritime Museum, has been carefully studying the wreck and its surrounding area to confirm its identity. If the São Jorge is confirmed, it would provide significant insight into early 16th-century maritime history.

A new study published in the American Journal of Primatology uses advanced 3D scanning technology to examine fossilized bones and muscle insertion points, shedding light on the evolution of bipedalism in human ancestors. Led by Professor Josep M. Potau from the University of Barcelona, the research suggests that early hominins, like Australopithecus and Paranthropus, combined bipedal locomotion with tree-climbing, similar to modern bonobos.

NASA’s Curiosity rover is set to explore Martian "spiderweb" formations, known as boxwork, which may reveal secrets about the planet’s ancient watery past. These unique structures, first observed decades ago, could help scientists understand Mars' history of water and the potential for past life. The rover’s investigation aims to study minerals left by ancient lakes and oceans, providing further insight into the planet's potential for supporting life.

Researchers from the University of Arizona have uncovered evidence of a powerful solar storm that occurred between 664 and 663 BCE, known as a Miyake Event. The discovery was made by analysing radiocarbon spikes in ancient tree rings, which act as natural records of past solar activity. These rare events, first identified in 2012, occur when solar radiation dramatically increases, leaving a trace in both tree rings and ice cores.
