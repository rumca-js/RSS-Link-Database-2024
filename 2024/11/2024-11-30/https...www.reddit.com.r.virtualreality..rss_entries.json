Since I enjoy building side projects I decided to make a job board for this particular field. </p> <p>I think it can be hard to only rely on the keywords &quot;AR&quot; &quot;VR&quot; &quot;Virtual Reality&quot; etc. so I spent some time researching interesting companies and I will keep researching to be able to offer a better selection. I was a bit surprised by the wide range of skills that can be covered: from game development, to hardware/embedded to web development, to 3D design, so it seems like there are many opportunities for people with many different backgrounds!</p> <p>Anyways hope this will be useful to someone else besides my friend!</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.arvrjobs.dev/\">AR VR Jobs</a></p>",
