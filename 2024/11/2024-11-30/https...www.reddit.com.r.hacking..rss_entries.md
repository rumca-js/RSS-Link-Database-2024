<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I mean the attacker would already have access to victims email account but the 2fa code is not sent in the email but it comes from a third party 2fa App or sent using SMS to the victim. Using the password reset link the attacker logs into the victims web account because the web app directly logs the user into the web account after the password reset instead of redirecting to a login page. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/General_Riju"> /u/General_Riju </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1h3g14t/is_2fa_bypass_using_password_reset_feature/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1h3g14t/is_2fa_bypass_using_password_reset_feature/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>hi, I downloaded cracked software. It has a crack file I&quot;m supposed to unpack. Windows quarantined it saying it&#39;s high risk as it&#39;s a hack tool. Should I be concerned, or can I release it from quarantine so that I can use the cracked software?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/earthwalker7"> /u/earthwalker7 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1h365c8/cracked_software/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1h365c8/cracked_software/">[comments]</a></span>
