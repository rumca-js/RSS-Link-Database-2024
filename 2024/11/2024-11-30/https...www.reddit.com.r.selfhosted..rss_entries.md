My server also resides in this range. When I connect to my VPN from other networks (e.g., public Wi-Fi, friends&#39; houses), the 192.168.x.x range overlaps because it’s so commonly used. This prevents me from accessing my server reliably. I&#39;m using Wireguard for the VPN. Also I would like to find a solution where I don&#39;t need to buy another router. </p> <p>Has anyone faced this before and found a workaround?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a seasoned software engineer and devops professional. If I have a server with login by password disabled, only ecdsa cert login and then user/pass with that, and ufw with only one port open say for port 80 or 443, can I still somehow get hacked? People will say &quot;yes&quot; to this question but I want to know how. What is going to give access? Like specifically. I&#39;m looking to harden my server but I don&#39;t see how anyone can get in unless the stuff I&#39;m hosting on ports have vulnerabilities.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Nimrod5000"> /u/Nimrod5000 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1h340mo/security_question_for_an_expert/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1h340mo/security_question_for_an_expert/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>SO basically I&#39;ve set up a remote VPS for my network. Now, for anything coming in the pipe at the office/lab/studio, I have a standalone pfSense box. I would love for it to have a UI that&#39;s easy to get around it. I can do all the bin/bash shit but I like some graphics too. Is there something along those lines that can run in docker?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Wild_Magician_4508"> /u/Wild_Magician_4508 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1h31jro/best_all_around_firewall_for_vps/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1h31jro/best_all_around_firewall_for_vps/">[comments]</a></span>

The cost estimator shows a monthly price of $2.13 without any free tier discount.</p> <p>At this rate, my monthly bill will amount to about over $100. I don’t understand why there is such a large discrepancy. Looking at the cost analysis, it clearly shows that charges are being applied for the compute resources of this exact instance I deployed. Can someone explain why there is such a significant difference?</p> <p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/r0dmlko
