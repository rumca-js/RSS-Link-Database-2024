If you've got fond memories of couch-co-op games of Halo and the early days on online arena deathmatch or LAN party video games, Mantic has made a game for you. Take command of a Squad of Spartans in Red or Blue and throw down in familiar game modes in HALO: Flashpoint, based on the Deadzone system.

Thanks to Mantic for the complimentary copy of the box  to review.

Welcome to the secluded region of Calabria... an isolated corner of Italy mostly unaffected by the Napoleonic Wars but very much plagued by a Necromancer problem. Your Specialist unit is tasked with discovering the reasons for a very green mist and a whole lot of Living Dead. Let's go!

Thanks to Osprey for the complimentary copy of the book to review.
