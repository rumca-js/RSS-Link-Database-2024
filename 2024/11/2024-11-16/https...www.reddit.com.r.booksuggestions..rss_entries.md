<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I recently read The Hitchcock Hotel by Stephanie Wrobel and There Are 3 Women &amp; 4 Men by Jaden Payne. I really appreciated the pop culture references in both, along with their storylines. I’m searching for my next read; hopefully something similar, bursting with references and familiarity. I’m a lover of pop culture.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So me and my partner are choosing books to put on a reading list for the next year. We both like books that deal with philosophy, psychology, mental health, meaning of life, maybe some social themes too. So something on a &quot;heavier&quot; side. We welcome some supernatural, surrealist, or mystery elements. We also can tolerate romance or family themes, but don&#39;t really enjoy them, so it would be neat if it wasn&#39;t the main focus.</p> <p>It&#39;s rather easy to find older male authors who fit this description. Like, most of the 20th century classics, really (classics before that can be too moralistic sometimes, we just like our absurdism and some nihilism here and there). Modern male authors aren&#39;t too hard to find too. But what about modern female authors? Any ideas? Both of us barely read modern literature and want to fix that.</p> <p>Thank you in advance. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.c

I attribute my current thoughtfulness and values to reading about my favorite characters&#39; hardships and challenges in my formative years, and I really built myself around being the type of person I admired in books. These characters were typically brave, clever, outcast young women who did what they felt in their hearts was right and fair. Usually these weren&#39;t do or die situations, but more like do or keep suffering situations.</p> <p>Well, this and that has happened in the world and my empathy, kindness, and care of others is crumbling. It has been happening for a long time, but there&#39;s hardly any of it left now and I kind of hate who I&#39;ve become. I want to be clever and kind, though I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever be v

When it comes to love, I haven’t had the best experiences, and sometimes, I find myself longing for a bit of escapism. But I’ve realized that in genres like fantasy and romance, I don’t connect with the typical tropes. Romance, in particular, feels like it’s full of ideas that just aren’t for me. I know it’s a vast genre, often geared more toward women, and I get that. But so often, the male character is depicted as perfect—this handsome, unattainable ideal. It feels hollow to me. I’m not interested in a love interest who’s just eye candy, and I definitely don’t want a female character who is merely a passive object of desire or trapped in unhealthy dynamics, like Stockholm syndrome.</p> <p>I’ve really searched for something diffe

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So, for a long time I&#39;ve been a fan of pirates, sailors and period dramas. I&#39;ve been searching for books, novels, on those subjects but I haven&#39;t found any that fit my taste.</p> <p>In terms of pirates and sailors I&#39;d like books that focus solely on the adventure itself with little to no romance or fantasy involved and preferably with a male main character. (I&#39;ve already read Master and Commander, the whole saga, by Patrick O&#39;Brian and Pirate Latitudes by Michael Crichton so any book of the sort is very welcomed)</p> <p>While for period dramas I&#39;d be okay with anything that gives the same vibe as either Peaky Blinders or Taboo, specifically if they feature characters that resemble Alfie Solomons or James Keziah Delaney, though that&#39;s not a requirement.</p> <p>If anyone has any suggestions please let me know.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SkywalkerThrawn"> /u/Skyw

In the past few years, I’ve branched out a lot and actively sought out A books featuring queer protagonists (mostly fantasy and detective stories, as those are my favorite genres, but I’ve been looking across the board).</p> <p>Lately I’ve been turning back to fiction, as I did when I was younger, for examples of how to navigate life. I’ve realized in this that all the stories I’ve read with FTM mc’s are in the YA age group. It’s leaving a longing in me lately. I don’t see in my media people going through what I am at my age range. I’ve read loads of fanfics from my favorites, meticulously looking for transmasc stories, but none scratch the itch I have.</p> <p>So looking for any recs of adult age range books featuring trans male mc’s.

I’m also a mom of two toddlers, so books written for moms are also welcome and appreciated. </p> <p>Preferably, I’d like something written by a therapist or doctor, but I’m not opposed to something written by someone outside of those professions. </p> <p>This will be a first step for me, that’s within my comfort zone enough for me to actually follow through with it. Please let me know what books made an impact on you, and/or what books you think fit the criteria I’m looking for.</p> <p>Thanks so much in advance. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/livelaughloveev"> /u/livelaughloveev </a> <br/> <span>
