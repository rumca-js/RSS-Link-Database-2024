Schluter shower curb tips…I built this custom curb with 2” KERDI-BOARD. I apply mortar to the edge of the pan and walls. When I set the curb in mortar I ensure it’s level left to right but pitched 1/32 to 1/16 toward the pan. 2x4s outside the shower keep my curb equidistant off the main shower wall which in turn helps with tile installation. Many thanks to Schluter for providing materials for my client’s shower build 👍🏽🔥#showerremodel #schlutersystems #bathroomremodel #brandpartner
