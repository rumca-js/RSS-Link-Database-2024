But some other books as soon as I read the through the description of their appearance I’m like yeah I don’t think so buddy. </p> <p>Do you guys do this too? And how do you get over an appearance you don’t really like. It’s not that there’s anything wrong with their appearance but for me personally I want to feel like the MMC is attractive and sometimes the way the author describes the character is just not it for me. Obviously it’s totally fine if the character doesn’t adhere to my view of attractiveness, I’m just curious if any one else feels like this?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Ment

Obviously, this is an important subject that many of us feel passionate about but unfortunately it has a tendency to come in waves and drown out any other discussion. We obviously don&#39;t want to ban this discussion but we also want to allow other posts some air to breathe. In order to accomplish this, we&#39;re going to post a discussion thread every month to allow users to post articles and discuss them.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>When I was little, I really liked superhero comics so I often tried to dress like them or act like them.

I&#39;m sure I wasn&#39;t the only one. I mean the movie had Matt Dillon, Rob Lowe, Tom Cruise, Ralph Macchio, Patrick Swayze....they defined cool and so everybody wanted to be like them.</p> <p>The Count of Monte Cristo was a whole other story.

Jerry forgets the name of one of his girlfriends who leaves a hint to him that her name rhymes with a part of the female anatomy. George provides a number of guesses in the episode, one of them being &quot;Bovary&quot;. Yes, this is why I chose to read the book. As I&#39;m sure many readers will already know, cross referencing other works in ones own art can be used to send a message, make a comparison, or emphasize contrasts, to name just a few utilities. I wanted to understand the significance of the reference both in the context of the individual Seinfeld episode as well as the series as a whole.</p> <p>On the outset, I think the book is fantastic an
