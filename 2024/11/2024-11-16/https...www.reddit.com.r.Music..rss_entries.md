I am just old enough to have constantly heard Creed and Three Doors Down at the roller skating rink growing up and really LOVE like eight songs between the two of them. I am just young enough to have missed out on ALL of the discourse about them being a Christian band, saying they’re not a Christian band, the complete over-saturation, and people becoming aware that Scott Stapp is an absolute MANIAC.</p> <p>I’m making a rule for myself moving forward. If I’m going to a show and people ask me, “huh. Aren’t they a Christian band?” Instead of repeating, “noooooo they just weave spiritual themes into their music!!!” Because that’s what I’ve heard, that question will be my signal that they are ABSOLUTELY a Christian band and have probably even gotten more passionate about spreading their testimony over time (yes, I’m salty, this happened with the killers last year or the year before).</p> <p>My fiancé and I went to this show somewhat ironically to hea

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey guys! I&#39;m doing a project for my degree on how some people use music and can become reliant on it to the point of displaying addictive behaviours. I myself feel like I&#39;m &quot;addicted&quot; to music and am very curious if other people feel the same. There is some research to suggest that music does affect the limbic system and the dopaminergic system in the brain, which is linked to addictive behaviour and I would like to explore this further by doing some interviews with people who feel they may be &quot;addicted&quot; to music. Interviews will be anonymous and done over Teams or Zoom. I need about 10 people and was wondering if anyone would be interested in doing an interview with me? It won&#39;t be done for another maybe month or two but I just need to see if I can get participants in the first place:)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Mimmamoushe"> /u/Mimmamoushe </a> <br/> <span>
