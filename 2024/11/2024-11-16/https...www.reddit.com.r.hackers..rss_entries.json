I&#39;ve been learning pentesting for about 2 years now recently started getting certs to credentialize myself and be able to apply for cyber security roles and over the past year I feel more isolated the more I learn I guess I&#39;m in a weird spot where my learning is pretty advanced but I&#39;m working a production job and the only person I can remotely talk to about technical subjects is the sys-admin of the company but Evan he struggles to keep up with some of the subjects I talk about (Linux) and has told me multiple times he &quot;doesn&#39;t understand half of what I say to him&quot; but still enjoys the conversation as he also can&#39;t relate to most of the people in the company in regards to technical subjects. Just looking to see if there are any other other budding pentesters that feel the same?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/us", "id": 1527986, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/hackers/comments/1gsxtr0/loneliness_as_a_aspiring_pentester", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 536, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/hackers/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Loneliness as a aspiring pentester", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-11-16T07:09:58+00:00", "description": "<table> <tr><td> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/hackers/comments/1gshx5b/this_girl_is_a_huge_time_hacker_that_has_spyware/\"> <img src=\"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/GULbI5LVHNofPcis2mwWN5amng_oX7TmUi7jYi_RoHQ.jpg\" alt=\"this girl is a huge time hacker that has spyware and other related trojan malware on her devices \" title=\"this girl is a huge time hacker that has spyware and other related trojan malware on her devices \" /> </a> </td><td> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Sea-Ebb-8707\"> /u/Sea-Ebb-8707 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gshx5b\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/hackers/comments/1gshx5b/this_girl_is_a_huge_time_hacker_that_has_spyware/\">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>", "id": 1525498, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/hackers/comments/1gshx5b/this_girl_is_a_huge_time_hacker_that_has_spyware", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 536, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/hackers/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/GULbI5LVHNofPcis2mwWN5amng_oX7TmUi7jYi_RoHQ.jpg", "title": "this girl is a huge time hacker that has spyware and other related trojan malware on her devices", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-11-16T00:44:32+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p><a href=\"https://goto.covenantbooks.com/conservative-publisher/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=738927022&amp;utm_content=157811613569&amp;utm_term=conservative%20book%20publishers&amp;kw=conservative%20book%20publishers&amp;cpn=738927022&amp;utm_term=conservative%20book%20publishers&amp;utm_campaign=Faith-Christian-G-Religious-2022JuneRefresh-Mob-Us-Search&amp;utm_source=adwords&amp;utm_medium=ppc&amp;hsa_acc=9171925190&amp;hsa_cam=738927022&amp;hsa_grp=157811613569&amp;hsa_ad=678493598376&amp;hsa_src=g&amp;hsa_tgt=kwd-298290954710&amp;hsa_kw=conservative%20book%20publishers&amp;hsa_mt=b&amp;hsa_net=adwords&amp;hsa_ver=3&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAudG5BhAREiwAWMlSjEexRbRrCMSCs7y4eLtvIK5BF5qChyl3U21BrhlihTCzQcW_Cf5udRoCeN4QAvD_BwE\">https://goto.covenantbooks.com/conservative-publisher/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=738927022&amp;utm_content=157811613569&amp;utm_term=conservative%20book%20publisher", "id": 1524754, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/hackers/comments/1gsbf00/is_this_an_advanced_malware_or_virus_attack", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 536, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/hackers/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Is this an advanced malware or virus attack disguised?", "vote": 0}]
