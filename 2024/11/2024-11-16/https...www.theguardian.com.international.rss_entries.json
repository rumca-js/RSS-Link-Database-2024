It is my first experience of zero gravity on an European Space Agency (Esa) parabolic flight. In theory I know what is going on, but my brain just cannot grasp that it is actually me that is floating, that I\u2019m suspended midair.</p><p>I am accompanying Britain\u2019s first female Esa astronaut, Rosemary Coogan, on the flight as part of her zero gravity training for a potential six-month deployment to the International Space Station. During the three-hour flight, sometimes referred to as the vomit comet, the plane will trace out 31 parabolas \u2013 soaring arcs in the sky.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2024/nov/16/my-trip-on-zero-gravity-flight-with-esa-astronaut-weightlessness\">Continue reading...</a>", "id": 1525369, "language": "en-US", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2024/nov/16/my-trip-on-zero-gravity-flight-with-esa-astronaut-weightlessness", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 341, "source_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/594274bfa4da8aac176402de2117136645f85c0a/122_0_3596_2160/master/3596.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5790b3de9c6585306fce8f4c1ab26f62", "title": "\u2018First instinct is to swim\u2019: my trip on a zero-gravity flight with an Esa astronaut", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-11-16T06:00:32+00:00", "description": "<p>Or how to make a traditional curd cheese in a matter of hours</p><p><a href=\"https://angiemilne.com/2020/08/06/scottish-crowdie-cheese/\">Crowdie</a> is a traditional soft fresh cheese from Scotland, originally made with sour milk. In raw, unpasteurised milk, lactic acid builds up as it sours, which helps the milk curdle when heated. Pasteurised milk, however, doesn\u2019t sour in quite the same way, so it\u2019s best to use it before it turns, though that could be after the best-before date, so rely on your senses to judge if it\u2019s still good.
