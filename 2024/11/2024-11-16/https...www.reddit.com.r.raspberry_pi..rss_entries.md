Or is it dependent on file type? currently outputing to mp4 but appreciate there are a few options.</p> <p>I assume some form of what I want here is possible, any help would be appreciated.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Funtycuck"> /u/Funtycuck </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1gsmdao/looking_to_save_video_on_shutdown_signal/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1gsmdao/looking_to_save_video_on_shutdown_signal/">[

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I only have a very basic understanding of python but ChatGPT as been holding my hand quite nicely but I&#39;ve hit a road block. </p> <p>I have a Raspberry Pi 4 with PiSound attached. </p> <p>I&#39;m trying to receive data from a Pioneer CDJ via the ethernet port.<br/> If I run <code>sudo tcpdump -i eth0 udp port 50001</code> I get this: </p> <pre><code>pi@raspberrypi:~/udp_test $ sudo tcpdump -i eth0 udp port 50001 tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v[v]... for full protocol decode listening on eth0, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), snapshot length 262144 bytes 11:47:48.060238 IP 169.254.252.162.7295 &gt; 169.254.255.255.50001: UDP, length 96 </code></pre> <p>confirming to me that I&#39;m receiving the data and the hardware connection is correct. The data stream stops when I hit pause on the CDJ and picks back up when I hit play. This is exactly as expected. </p> <p>However when I try to access this data with a python script, it receives nothing.
