I am wondering if anyone has any books or quotes in mind that might speak to these ideas?</p> <p>An example of what I have in mind is Imre Kert\u00e9sz\u2019s book liquidation (spoiler alert), which is an existential novel in which a play writer takes his life and after his death his friends find a final play that he wrote before his death that predicts the conversations his bereaved friends have to the word. </p> <p>Any help or suggestions would be super appreciated! I am planning on using examples from literature in my thesis so I am compiling a list of potentially related works. Thanks! </p> <p>M</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Lazy_Candidate_2881\"> /u/Lazy_Candidate_2881 </a> <", "id": 1527159, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1gsqp0n/books_about_mimesis_and_simulation_fiction", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 532, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Books about mimesis and simulation (fiction)", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-11-16T16:12:34+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I find pirates really interesting and would love some books that have pirates in them.
