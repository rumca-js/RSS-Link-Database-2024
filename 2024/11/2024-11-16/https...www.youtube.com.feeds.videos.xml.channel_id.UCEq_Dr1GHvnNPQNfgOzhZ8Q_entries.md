The Teen Titans meet for the first time and introduce themselves! Robin, Starfire, Cyborg, Wonder Girl and Beast Boy discover a random really strange editorial decision made about Kid Flash that has never been touched upon since. But he's cool. Like it's chill, don't worry. It's ok. It's fine. He's for conversation. All good.
