<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I flashed one, and I tried to flash it again with a new code, but it kept failing, I thought wiring was wrong, so forward 30mn later, I flash a new one, it worked, flashed it again, it failed, I don&#39;t want to risk a 3rd one since I&#39;m running low. What is the issue? Is it one time flash?</p> <p>The code I test was just an LED flashing. The chip still turning the led on and off, it just don&#39;t get flashed again.</p> <p><a href="https://www.wch-ic.com/downloads/CH32V003DS0_PDF.html">Datasheet (with pinouts)</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.wch-ic.com/downloads/CH32V003RM_PDF.html">Datasheet for other details (without pinouts)</a></p> <p><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tengo10/pinout-overview/main/pinouts/CH32v003/ch32v003j4m6.svg">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tengo10/pinout-overview/main/pinouts/CH32v003/ch32v003j4m6.svg</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Popular-Power-697
