I colorized, restored, and designed the sound for this fascinating video of Tokyo, Japan, from the 1940s. The sequence captures a moving perspective from an automobile, beginning with a reverse-angle view at the entrance of the U.S. Air Force Military Air Transport System passenger terminal. As the vehicle exits the base, it glides along a scenic road near a body of water under clear daylight. The shots evolve into dynamic three-quarter angles and forward-facing perspectives, offering a vivid portrayal of the surroundings and a glimpse into the era.
