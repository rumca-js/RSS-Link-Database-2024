<p>At the World Cheese Awards in Portugal, British entries were conspicuous by their absence after failing to clear import controls</p><p>On Friday, 240 experts from 40 countries descended on Viseu in northern Portugal for the World Cheese Awards.

## No organisation, leadership or direction: Ghana are wasting a generation of talent | Jonathan Wilson

<p>They should be one of the Africa Cup of Nations favourites, instead Ghana are facing up to another chaotic failure</p><p>What made it especially painful was that, just briefly, it seemed they might get away with it. But they did not. Ghana did not get the win they needed in Angola on Friday and so Mohammed Kudus, Thomas Partey and Antoine Semenyo will not be at the next Cup of Nations, which&nbsp;begins in Morocco in December 2025.</p><p>Ghana have been terrible in the qualifiers. Their elimination is deserved. They went into their final pair of games needing to win both and hope Sudan lost both of theirs. The likelihood was that it would all be over on Thursday, when Sudan, managed by the former Ghana coach Kwesi Appiah, which has added a whole other tier of complication, went to Niger. But Niger won, 4-0. Nobody had expected that. For Ghana there was a glimmer of hope.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/16/ghana-wasting-generation-of-talent-africa-cup-of-

The results are still not falling their way but a fifth defeat on the spin told only a fraction of the story of this compelling match. If the world champions ultimately walked away victorious, this was also the day that Steve Borthwick’s side answered a good few uncomfortable questions about their ability and tactical direction.</p><p>If all Test matches were this thunderous and hypnotically watchable there would be no need to rustle up half-baked fantasy schemes to try and flog rugby to the unconverted. The quicksilver Marcus Smith was again the attacking ringmaster for England but in the end the matchwinner was the even more diminutive Cheslin Kolbe, whose two brilliantly-taken tries saw the world’s No 1-ranked side home.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/nov/16/en

<p>It was an emphatic end to the tightest of chess matches, but goals from Mayra Ramírez and Guro Reiten ensured Chelsea took the spoils from the most strategic of encounters to leapfrog Manchester City at the top of the WSL table.</p><p>The anguish on Alex Greenwood’s face after Ramírez had escaped her clutches, the one and only time she would across the 96 minutes played, told the story of the significance of the defeat. Both managers had played down the impact of this one game on the title race, last season City took four points across the two games against their rivals with Chelsea winning the title on goal difference.

A painstaking process, it nonetheless suits Lito’s “propensity to devote long hours to detailed work” – a diagnosis of ADHD aged 30 was what prompted him to quit his corporate job and start carving leaves for a living. And a living it is: he’s sold 300,000 copies of his leaf-art books to date and exhibits his work throughout Japan.

We had a late licence until 1am, and everybody – mostly fishermen – got a bit too pissed, and we couldn’t keep order.

<p>The pioneering feminist editor and publisher died in October. The Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit author looks back on the close friendship they shared</p><p>I met Philippa Brewster in 1983. She was a commissioning editor at Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul – in&nbsp;those days an independent London publisher, specialising in nonfiction. Philippa had been given the go-ahead by RKP to launch Pandora Press. Back&nbsp;then, publishing was a male-dominated industry. Editors were men, authors were men, reviewers were men. This was normal. Feminism had begun to change the normal.</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/virago">Virago</a> led the field in 1973, initially republishing female writers whose work had gone out of print. The Women’s Press, founded in 1978, was more directly political, and interested in the work of women of colour whose voices were not heard. Philippa saw a&nbsp;gap in the market for a nonfiction imprint covering history, biography, travel, cultural studies –

<p>Or how to make a traditional curd cheese in a matter of hours</p><p><a href="https://angiemilne.com/2020/08/06/scottish-crowdie-cheese/">Crowdie</a> is a traditional soft fresh cheese from Scotland, originally made with sour milk. In raw, unpasteurised milk, lactic acid builds up as it sours, which helps the milk curdle when heated. Pasteurised milk, however, doesn’t sour in quite the same way, so it’s best to use it before it turns, though that could be after the best-before date, so rely on your senses to judge if it’s still good. If you make crowdie with regular pasteurised milk, you’ll need an acidulant such as lemon juice or vinegar to help separate the curds and whey, as in my recipe today.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/nov/16/how-to-turn-old-milk-into-cheese-recipe-tom-hunt-zero-waste-food">Continue reading...</a>
