Research on fossil teeth from a 1.77-million-year-old early Homo specimen challenges the "big brain, long childhood" hypothesis. The study suggests that the extended childhood seen in humans may have evolved as a result of cultural transmission, not just brain growth. By analysing dental growth patterns, scientists show that Homo’s development was marked by a longer dependency on adults, leading to the evolution of larger brains. This discovery may shift our understanding of human evolution.

A giant coral reef, the largest ever recorded, has been discovered in the Solomon Islands, measuring 111 feet wide and 104 feet long. This reef is estimated to be 300-500 years old, offering a vital habitat for marine life. Scientists are concerned about the threats it faces, including overfishing and climate change, both of which could jeopardize its survival. This discovery underscores the importance of protecting coral ecosystems worldwide.

A new study led by the University of Tartu has shown that industrial emissions, particularly aerosol particles, can influence local snowfall by triggering ice formation in supercooled clouds. Using satellite and ground-based radar observations, researchers found that factories, including cement plants and power stations, may cause localised snow plumes. This discovery suggests that anthropogenic aerosols play a role in altering cloud behaviour, potentially impacting weather patterns around industrial hot spots.
