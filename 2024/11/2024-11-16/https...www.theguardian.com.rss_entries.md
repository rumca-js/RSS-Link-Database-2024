<p>Captain reiterates need to maintain Southgate’s inclusive environment as he gets ready to compete for place in team</p><p>For Harry Kane, it has been a time for straight-talking. The England captain did row back slightly on his comments from Wednesday – the bombshell ones when he wondered whether the unprecedented number of withdrawals from the squad for this window was the result of players “taking advantage” of a tough period in the season.</p><p>At one point, as Kane took a break from the preparations for Sunday’s Nations League tie against Republic of Ireland at Wembley – the final game of Lee Carsley’s interim tenure – he expressed a surprise at the wall-to-wall coverage his words had driven.

<p>Amid sluggish UK productivity and global insecurity, pulling closer to Europe is diplomatically and economically vital</p><p>Achieving the fastest sustainable growth in the G7 was the Labour party’s highest-profile pledge going into the general election last July.

<p>A sourdough-and-rocket monotony is spreading outwards from the M25. I worry about what we’re losing</p><p>I have a vivid memory of arriving at university at the back end of the 1980s and telling someone I needed to buy a bread cake, at which point I remembered (too late!) that most people call the round baked item in question a bap or a roll. The term bread cake – no, it has nothing whatsoever to do with cake – is highly regional: a&nbsp;South Yorkshire and, at a push, East Midlands thing. If I’d been wearing a&nbsp;Tracey Emin-style neon sign on my head that said, “I am from elsewhere, possibly another planet”, I couldn’t have announced myself more clearly. Not that I was embarrassed – and in any case, old habits die hard. On Sunday mornings, when I make bacon sandwiches, the floury baps that I like to use, soft as pillows, are still bread cakes to me. They&nbsp;always will be.</p><p>The experience I describe was, however, a long time ago and, today, as I think about making pease

<p>Everything you need to know to plan for your future after Rachel Reeves’s inheritance tax changes in the budget</p><p>Since 2012, employers have had to enrol eligible workers in a pension scheme. You can opt out if you want, but the idea is that you are less likely to leave a pension than start one. Once in the scheme, your employer must&nbsp;make payments worth at least 3% of your salary. You must put in the equivalent of at least 5% of your pre-tax salary. But many experts say that isn’t enough. Phoenix Insights, a thinktank, says the current 8% total minimum contribution “is too low for most savers to achieve an adequate retirement income, and may be giving some a false sense of security”. So consider increasingupping your payments if you can.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2024/nov/16/uk-pensions-how-to-save-for-retirement-inheritance-tax-budget">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Woodward’s latest page turner takes you inside the room – but can he still claim to be an impartial fly on the wall?</p><p>Bob Woodward is probably the best-known journalist in the world. He built his reputation on Watergate, of course, and just about&nbsp;everything he and Carl Bernstein wrote about it turned out to be entirely accurate: including the existence of Deep Throat, who was sometimes thought to be a “Woodstein” invention, but was much later revealed to be a top FBI official. If you talk to Woodward on deep background, he won’t break trust with you and leak your name; so hundreds of senior officials and politicians over the years have had the&nbsp;confidence to speak to&nbsp;him on condition of anonymity. In&nbsp;War, as in every other one of Woodward’s 22 books (this one billed as a “behind-the-scenes story of three wars – Ukraine, the Middle East and the struggle for the American Presidency”), you can have total faith&nbsp;in the accuracy of every quotation he provide

<p>This cosy homestead offers all the simple pleasures for a winter escape: great scenery, log burners, no wifi and a pile of paperbacks</p><p>The lane gets steeper and&nbsp;narrower, the roar of&nbsp;the river louder. We&nbsp;turn to cross the old&nbsp;stone bridge and, two farm gates later, are bouncing up through a forest of gnarly oak and moss-swaddled boulders to&nbsp;emerge on&nbsp;a grassy belvedere by the&nbsp;old farm. The&nbsp;last rays of sun are touching the distant peaks of Cadair Idris. There is not another dwelling in&nbsp;sight … unless that speck on the far hillside might be a house?</p><p>Inside there is a slate floor polished by two centuries of Welsh feet. In&nbsp;the&nbsp;rooms beyond we find a pair of&nbsp;log-burners, two cast-iron baths and&nbsp;several well-worn rugs and sofas. Best&nbsp;of all, there’s a kitchen humming with warmth from an Aga, a guitar and&nbsp;many piles of books. Later, I stand outside on the sheep-cropped lawn, watching the millstream ca

<p>An all-star return to ancient Rome, and eclectic new sounds from the No Doubt singer</p><p><strong>Gladiator II</strong><br><em>Out now</em><br>
 It’s tough to get lightning to strike twice, and the first Gladiator film is one of the jewels in director Ridley Scott’s crown. Still, with the likes of Paul Mescal, Joseph Quinn and Denzel Washington slipping into the sandals, togas and bum-skimming tunics, at the very least this is an eye-catchingly cast trip to Rome.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2024/nov/16/going-out-staying-in-complete-guide-to-this-weeks-entertainment-uk">Continue reading...</a>
