I have been taking an interest in the coding world and cyber security since I started playing the Ubisoft game watchdogs, and I took it upon myself to make this phone a project, a proper RFID, Infared, Wifi scanner thingy like the flipper zero. but before I make my purchases I wanna ask if it&#39;s even possible with a phone like this? I would love to learn more about this even if I can&#39;t use this phone for this task. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Ryzi
