<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>What I&#39;ve been doing until now is keeping my entire nextcloud available locally and keeping my docker folder backed up periodically.

Thanks for any help and advice, I&#39;m just trying to do it right and not lose anything the vps is using Debian, 12 I think. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/automaticfiend1"> /u/automaticfiend1 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1gvc4hk/i_have_a_vps_i_pay_for_and_host_things_like_my/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1gvc4hk/i_have_a_vps_i_pay_for_and_host_things_like_my/">[comments]</a></span>
