## Game recommendations for a non gamer with broken wrists

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>My wife has two broken wrists, her left hand is completely wrapped but the fingers on her right hand are free and she can use a mouse at her own pace. She is incredibly bored, and can’t do much, so I want to recommend her some games to help her pass the time while she heals.</p> <p>She’s not really a gamer tho. Her two favorite games are animal crossing and Mario odyssey. Anything beyond that she has a hard time getting into. </p> <p>Knowing her, games like slay the spire are out, she’s not much into strategy or role playing. So are there any games that a non gamer who can only use a mouse slowly and carefully might enjoy? Does that unicorn exist? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ABlokeLikeYou"> /u/ABlokeLikeYou </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1gvjort/game_recommendations_for_a_non_gamer_with_broken/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com
