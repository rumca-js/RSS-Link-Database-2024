I loved it, but something has struck me a couple hours later. In one of the last chapters, after Kya is found not guilty, she sees Tate being picked up by the sheriff. This is when the Sheriff tells Tate that Scupper has died, but being written from Kya’s POV, she thinks “Why had they apprehended Tate? Was it something to do with Chases death?”</p> <p>In the final chapter, Tate finds the box of Kya’s poems, and the shell necklace, confirming that she was, in fact, the one who killed Chase. </p> <p>If Kya killed Chase, why did she think Tate was getting picked up for something related to the murder? Surely Tom explained to her that she can’t be tried for murder again? Kya knows she did it, so she can’t be thinking that Tate did it secretly to protect her, and she knows Tate doesn’t know anything because she

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I just finished James by Percival Everette and I thought it was really good. There are definitely quite a few variations from Huckleberry Finn, but mostly the changes I would say are good for the story he’s telling. I think it definitely reads more like literary fiction as compared to the original adventure story that Huckleberry Finn was to me. I think Jim (or James) is comparable to how I imagine Frederick Douglass was based on his narrative.</p> <p>I think there’s much more satire in Huckleberry Finn toward religion and the institution of slavery. So, I think the new adaptation is more on the nose of the issues, but I think it was still really great. Considering Twain was intentionally writing an entertaining story and Everette was more focused on writing something that would look back in retrospect to the perspectives of slaves like Frederick Douglass, I think the changes are justified. </p> <p>The big difference between the two novels is the sen
