<p>Imagine being in a meeting, perhaps with a client or with other team members, and not quite sharing the same preferred languages. Communication barriers can cause all kinds of misunderstandings and issues when collaborating, and a translator isn’t always available.</p>



<p>At Ignite 2024, Microsoft just unveiled a cool new feature for Microsoft Teams that uses artificial intelligence to not only translate words from one language to another in real time, but even emulate the speaker’s voice, intonations, and mannerisms.</p>



<p>Microsoft says a preview version of this “AI interpreter” feature will come some time in early 2025, but it remains unknown when the feature will be released more generally across all versions of Teams.</p>



<p>The Teams interpreter will initially support nine languages: English, Chinese (Mandarin), Korean, German, Italian, Ja

<p>Microsoft’s “see everything, remember everything, everywhere, all the time” <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2360514/microsoft-retreats-on-recall-always-on-screenshots-will-be-opt-in.html">Windows Recall feature</a> has been controversial since the moment it was announced. While the utility for users is obvious, it’s also easy to see why people aren’t keen to let either their local PC or Microsoft remember everything they do with a visual record. Microsoft seems to have capitulated, at least for business users.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2024/11/19/microsoft-ignite-2024-embracing-the-future-of-windows-at-work/">a new blog post</a> (spotted by <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/microsoft-to-business-users-recall-feature-will-be-disabled-by-default">PCMag</a>), Windows Recall will be disabled by defa

<p>As soon as VR headsets started going mainstream, people were wondering if you could use them to replace conventional monitors for an immersive Windows experience. And yes, you can — there are already several ways to do that right now.</p>



<p>But starting in December, Meta’s Quest 3 and Quest 3S headsets will get official support to stream Windows 11, direct from Microsoft. The capability was announced in a <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/windows-itpro-blog/windows-ai-powered-cloud-enabled-and-secure/4299069">post-Ignite news roundup</a> and shown off in a short video, below:</p>
