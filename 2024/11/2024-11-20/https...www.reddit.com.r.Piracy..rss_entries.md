Starting off with any previous experience and current technologies, I&#39;m pretty skeptical of Kindle as I have already read and downloaded and read epub and pdf files onto an android tablet, but it is old and not very convenient. I have heard from other people that in general, the downloading process of kindle is weird as they don&#39;t support epub. So is the process of pirating using epub/pdf more convenient with nook or kindle? </p> <p>What I&#39;m looking for within either e-readers: 7-7.8 inch display (with leeway) with 32 gb of storage</p> <p>P.S. some pros of nook that I like are the 32gb of storage within base models and pros of kindle being the amazon catalogs which honestly I could live with and without. </p> <p>Some models I&#39;ve been looking around is the Nook glowlight 4 p

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I regrettably tried to install Adobe Character Animator from <a href="http://TorrentMac.net">TorrentMac.net</a></p> <p>The installer was literally called installer, had a abstract black background, and had no reference to Adobe Character Animator. </p> <p>When I went through the installer it popped up with &quot;Application Helper&quot; and had me enter my password, afterward, I heard about 5 sounds (the sound when you move something into a folder), but I have no idea what and Adobe Character Animator is NOT installed. </p> <p>Anyone know what this is? Is it just a straight up fake installer to trick me into installing Malware?</p> <p>Im thinking about doing a factory reset. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/MrRogerSweaters"> /u/MrRogerSweaters </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1gvc2p3/cracked_mac_installer_added_multiple_files_but_i/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span
