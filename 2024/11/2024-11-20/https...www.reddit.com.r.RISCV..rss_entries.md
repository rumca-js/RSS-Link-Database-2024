## Is there a trick (or extension) to pack two 32 bit floats in one 64 bit register?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m developing something that might need to have the ability to work with many 32 bit floats at once. However, if it&#39;s running on a 64 bit system, then we&#39;re throwing away half of the available bits. Is there some way to pack two 32 bit floats into a single register and work with it in place? I know it might be possible to do something funky with storing them in integer registers instead and then converting to float when necessary, but that&#39;s a lot of overhead.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Slammernanners"> /u/Slammernanners </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1gvs5bi/is_there_a_trick_or_extension_to_pack_two_32_bit/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1gvs5bi/is_there_a_trick_or_extension_to_pack_two_32_bit/">[comments]</a></span>

## Starfive has running silicon of a 7nm RISC-V chip?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I saw this video from Ren√© Rebe, where he mentions he got a new 7nm RISC-V chip from StarFive (he keeps mentioning StarFive)? Is this the JH8100? He mentions that not all cores are running. Perhaps that explains why lscpu only shows 4 cores (around 17:30)?</p> <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7uvvTGECd4&amp;t=383s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7uvvTGECd4&amp;t=383s</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/LivingLinux"> /u/LivingLinux </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1gvrjx4/starfive_has_running_silicon_of_a_7nm_riscv_chip/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1gvrjx4/starfive_has_running_silicon_of_a_7nm_riscv_chip/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I just watched a video by explainingcomputers about milk-v jupiter, and one thing I noticed is how slow it was, despite the processor having 8 1.8GhZ cores (which is much better than my specs).</p> <p>So what would you say is keeping RISC-V computers from being somewhat as powerful as traditional computers? Do you think it is because software (compilers) is not as optimized for RISC-V architecture, or is there some other hardware component that is the bottleneck?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/DontFreeMe"> /u/DontFreeMe </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1gvo7dv/what_is_the_performance_bottleneck_for_riscv/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1gvo7dv/what_is_the_performance_bottleneck_for_riscv/">[comments]</a></span>
