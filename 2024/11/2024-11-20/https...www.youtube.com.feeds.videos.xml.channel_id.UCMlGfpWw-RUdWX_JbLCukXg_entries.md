Compile-Time Validation in C++ Programming - Alon Wolf - CppCon 2024
---

C++ is often criticized for its lack of inherent memory safety, but the spectrum of potential program validations extends far beyond just memory concerns. This talk delves into the necessity of early validation, emphasizing the benefits of compile-time checks in C++. By leveraging compile-time validation, developers can catch errors and enforce constraints before the code is even executed, enhancing both safety and correctness.

A functional programming approach to compile-time validation will be discussed, highlighting its benefits and demonstrating its application in ensuring code correctness.

Moreover, the talk will delve into the realm of compile-time unit tests, showcasing how they enable developers to validate code behavior at compile time, paving the way for more efficient debugging and maintenance.

Exploring advanced features, we'll discuss existing compile-time techniques to
