It should be clear by now that being a fan of one particular politician doesn&#8217;t make you a member of a &#8220;protected&#8221; group.

We also pointed out how Carr&#8217;s &#8220;policies&#8221; are utterly indistinguishable from the interests of unpopular telecom and media giants like Comcast and AT&#38;T.
