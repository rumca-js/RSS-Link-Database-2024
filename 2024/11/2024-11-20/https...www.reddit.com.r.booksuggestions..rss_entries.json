As the cold and rainy weather is approaching, I&#39;m looking for some new reads. I&#39;m a fan of knotting so I&#39;m glad there&#39;s finally some fantastic series that feature it (if you have a suggestion for a good book/series, let me know). </p> <p>I&#39;m posting because I&#39;m specifically looking for two...types (I guess?) of spice (or more appropriately, kink I guess). I was wondering if anyone knew of book(s) and/or series that featured scenes with ghosts/spirits/phantoms/etc? I read one years ago and it was fantastic. The other thing I was looking for are coil-y things. Yes, tentacles (so unoriginal) but I read a short many series years ago that featured a python. It was amazing and ended up being kinda formative.

I know me buying a book thats 15 or 20 dollar doesnt seem like a big deal contrary it supports the writer who is loved by many other readers. But i just didnt want to spend money on a book that in the future i may not even enjoy. So thats why i was hoping to know is there a way for me to read books for free. i could also use some suggestions about what kind of book i should read? I enjoy sci fi, romance, action, informational and deep quotes and poetry.
