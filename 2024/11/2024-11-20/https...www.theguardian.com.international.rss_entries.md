<p>As the two-point try celebrates 30 years in the NFL rule book, teams are converting a scant 31.3% of them this season, down from 55.1% last year</p><p>The Baltimore Ravens were hardly having the best of days, but they’d successfully negotiated a last-ditch journey Sunday against the Pittsburgh Steelers by driving 69 yards in nine plays for a touchdown. The Steelers suddenly led by just 18-16 with 66 seconds left.</p><p>No doubt the Ravens would try a two-point conversion to tie the score and send the game into overtime. But the Steelers, expecting a Tim Tebow-like pop pass, called time out as quarterback Lamar Jackson got ready to take the snap. So the Ravens called another play.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2024/nov/20/two-point-conversion-struggles-nfl-team">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Director Jordan Tragash marks himself out as one to watch with these interlocking stories of a vibrant group of 20-somethings all hustling for money</p><p>Sparkling and vivacious, Jordan Tragash’s heartfelt queer comedy captures with considerable charm the conundrums of the precarious gig worker’s lifestyle. For those familiar with Chicago, BAM! – standing for “Broke Ass Motherfuckers!” – is a dose of eye-candy adventure, rollicking through a series of beloved local landmarks. The interlocking stories bring together a delightful group of 20-somethings, all hustling for money. Living out of a storage unit, Auggie (Tuxford Turner) delivers sex toys to make ends meet, a job that is hilariously unsexy in practice. Always on a bike, Auggie soon cross paths with another courier Eve (Tip Sayarath), whose spirited energy makes for a contrast with Auggie’s endearing awkwardness. Throw in a freelance pharmacist – AKA a drug dealer – and his hapless employees, and we’ve got ourselves a real

<p>Jordan Peterson’s blinkered reading of the Bible does his cause no favours</p><p>It is not easy to review any book by Jordan Peterson, the prolific Canadian psychologist turned lifestyle sage. The temptation is to respond not to the work but the person (or persona): irascible, derisive, uncompromising, contrarian. But here, the work itself poses problems; it is a sprawling, repetitive text that could have done with some ruthless editing. Ostensibly a step-by-step guide through the biblical narratives of Genesis and Exodus (and, for some reason, Jonah), with the goal of uncovering wisdom to help meet present-day moral challenges, it in fact returns persistently to some of Peterson’s favourite tropes about modern culture, its flabbiness and confusion.</p><p>At one level its structure and argument are clear enough. The scriptural text confronts us, says Peterson, with a set of life-and-death choices. We can conform our rebellious fantasies and myth-driven aspirations to the underlyin
