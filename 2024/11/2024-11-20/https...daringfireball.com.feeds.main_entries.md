<p>Sara Fischer, reporting for Axios:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple has started selling its own advertising inventory for Apple
News, two sources familiar with the effort told Axios. It’s
pitching new ad units that it hopes will maximize revenue for
itself and its publishing partners. [...]</p>

<ul>
<li>Publishers will get a 70% cut of the ad revenue sold by Apple
within their articles.</li>
<li>They will get a percentage of the ad revenue sold by Apple
within the Apple News feed, dependent on engagement with their
content.</li>
<li>Apple News publishers will continue to receive 100% of the
revenue from the advertising that they sell against their
content in the app.</li>
</ul>

<p>Apple News+ is a really good product. Scanning its main Today tab in the morning has become my modern-day equivalent of scanning the front page of a printed newspaper — a way to get a sense of what’s going on in world news. There’s a level of editorial curation and presentation in Apple News

## Bob Iger Inadvertently Reveals Percentage of Disney+ Subscribers on Ad-Supported Tier

<p>Dade Hayes, reporting for Deadline:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Fielding a question from a Wall Street analyst about the growth
outlook and pricing strategy of Disney+, Iger divulged how many
Disney+ subscribers take the ad-supported tier in the U.S. (37%)
and globally (30%). The disclosure was unusual in the streaming
sector. Netflix, for instance, has never broken out a similar
percentage, preferring instead to report monthly active users of
its ad tier (as <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/11/netflix-ad-tier-70m-monthly-users-streaming-1236173495/">it did earlier this week</a>).</p>

<p>When the Q&amp;A with analysts moved to the next question and CFO Hugh
Johnston was giving his answer, Iger’s voice suddenly could be
heard on the call. “I don’t know if I was supposed to disclose
those AVOD numbers,” he said, before Johnston continued speaking.</p>

<p>James Baggott, writing for Car Dealer Magazine:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Jaguar unveiled a new look, logo and direction for its cars at
what was quite possibly the most bizarre automotive media launch
I’ve ever attended — here’s what happened.</p>

<p>Embargoed until today, the event felt like a hallucinogenic sci-fi
movie where the presenters were only allowed to speak in marketing
babble. Unveiling a new concept car — the details of which are
still under embargo until December 3 — Jaguar’s passionate team
spoke for most of the day about how they plan to ‘delete ordinary’
and ‘live vivid’. Whatever that means…</p>

<p>In what, at times, felt like a drunken dream, Jaguar personnel
walked journalists through its plans to ‘reimagine’ the much-loved
brand over the next few years. Calling it a ‘complete reset’,
McGovern at one point told journalists that his team had ‘not been
sniffing the white stuff — this is real’.</p>

<p>Translation: they’ve all been sniffing a metri
