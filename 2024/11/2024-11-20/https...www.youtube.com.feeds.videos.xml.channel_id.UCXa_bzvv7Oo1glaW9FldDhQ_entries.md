S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl is an absolutely massive game- and in more ways than one. Its map is a mind-bogglingly huge one at over 60 square kilometers, all of it crammed full of a bevy of content for players to dive into, while the game also touts a dense web of systems and mechanics that work together to deliver brilliantly reactive gameplay. 

Of course, all of that also means that with so much going on in the game, your early hours could be a bit overwhelming, if not outright daunting, especially if you don’t have too much familiarity with past S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games. So, as you prepare to brave the many dangers of the Chornobyl Exclusion Zone, make sure to keep these tips and tricks in mind.

STALKER 2 is nothing short of a marvel. The wait for GSC Game World series’ revival has been long and torturous – more so for the developer itself than any of us, given the circumstances it has had to endure behind the scenes – but against all odds, not only does this game exist, it’s also unequivocally excellent. 

Its genre-bending antics pull together staples of open world, survival horror, and immersive sim experiences together into a cohesive whole that’s unlike anything else. Stellar emergent open world gameplay, terrifying and potent horror, an incredibly immersive and detailed open world, and engrossing player-driven storytelling combine in one of the year’s best games. S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 is occasionally let down by its many technical issues at present, but the game itself is spectacular.
