The Speldosa AU/VST plugin I created together with klevgrand.com just got an upgrade! https://klevgrand.com/products/speldosa

Here is the info from Klevgrand:

Enter Speldosa v.1.0.3 - control your Magic

Our small but very popular instrument, Speldosa – Music Box, has just received a new update. Together with Wintergatan we’ve now added damping for more control. We hope that all you Muggles out there are pleased — because the wizards, have been working!

Behind the scene!

Klevgrand and Wintergatan’s collaboration begun years back when we met in our admiration for the craft of creating new things and our passion for creating music. The result of our weekly talks and numerous “Swedish fika” resulted in the product Speldosa – Music Box, that was released 2023. We really feel that Speldosa reflects Wintergatan’s approach to engineering — being as precise as it is beautiful.

In this new update of Speldosa v1.0.3 , we’ve added damping possibilites to provide even more tonal variations
