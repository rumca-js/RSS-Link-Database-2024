								<p>On one level, <strong>Warhammer 40,000</strong>’s Emperor of Mankind is a cosmic genius, a master of 5D chess who manipulates the strands of fate and fights an endless war against the machinations of the Chaos gods. On another level, he is a clown-shoes bozo who can’t move forwards without stepping on a rake.
