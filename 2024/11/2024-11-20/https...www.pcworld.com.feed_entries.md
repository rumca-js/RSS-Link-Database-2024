<p>At Ignite 2024, Microsoft unveiled a new feature for the Windows 11 taskbar. It’s called Microsoft 365 Companions and it’ll give users quick access to important data, reports <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/19/24300605/microsoft-365-companions-windows-taskbar-files-people-calendar">The Verge</a>.</p>



<p>These so-called “companions” are additional bits of information that are integrated into the taskbar and Start menu, and you can spot these details — which include contacts, files, and calendar events — at a glance.</p>

## No more frights: Microsoft Edge is getting scareware protection

<p>You’re on the web, minding your business—and then out of nowhere, you lose control of your screen. Pop-up windows flash warnings that your PC has been compromised or you’re being spied upon. However, if you take the remedy suggested, like downloading so-called antivirus software, you’ve actually fallen for a type of scam known as scareware.</p>



<p>To combat this old form of malware, Microsoft will soon upgrade Edge with a new form of protection. Announced during the Microsoft Ignite conference, the company will use machine learning to identify scareware within Edge tabs and warn users of the danger. The browser will contain the perceived scam attempt unless you give the green light—so if you know the site is safe, you’re still able to proceed.</p>

<p>This week, the rumor mill is swirling once again around a Google-made first-party laptop, one that’ll presumably run ChromeOS. Sources say that the company is committing to a new design, possibly emboldened by a new direction that more closely marries Chrome and Android.</p>



<p>It’s an interesting possibility from many angles, but the one that I want to chew on is this: What could Google possibly do differently this time to make a laptop that people actually want to buy?</p>



<p>Before I continue, I should point out that all of this is based entirely on speculation. Here’s a story about Google <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/exclusive-google-pixel-laptop-development.html">pushing hard on a new laptop design</a>, and here’s a story about <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/chrome-os-becoming-android-3500661/">a new version of ChromeOS
