<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Has anybody received their A600GS yet? Ordered mine in late June and it is still pending. Was really hoping to have it before Christmas but losing hope by the day! Just wondered if anyone had received them yet, particularly those who didn&#39;t pre order it.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Ill_Beyond_7909"> /u/Ill_Beyond_7909 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1gvd2f0/a600gs_wait_time/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1gvd2f0/a600gs_wait_time/">[comments]</a></span>
