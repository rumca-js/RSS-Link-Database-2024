## What if board games came with sticker sheets to update your game in case game balance changes over time?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Games can change over time. Game developers spend hundreds of hours playtesting and balancing a game. But inevitably, over time as <em>thousands</em> of people play the game, new synergies, meta strategies, or imbalances may emerge that the developers did not foresee. </p> <p>I was thinking about how mobile games can be updated so that all players can experience the game with the latest tweaks and balancing. With board games, you&#39;re often stuck with the version you bought unless the publisher later releases some sort of update pack. What if board games came with stickers so that players could adjust things like costs and victory point values whenever an update was announced?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/cosmosinc"> /u/cosmosinc </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1gw0vzg/what_if_board_games_came_with_sticker_sheets_to/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a hr

## Regicide is very fun!

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Just played our first 2 player game of Regicide. We lost, but had a lot of fun. My first impression is that it is quite a thinky game, you have to consider a couple of things in your turn, although you are not overwhelmed with decisions. It is such an elegant design and it is brilliant how you can make something like this from a standard deck of cards. My only con would be the luck of the draw, it is still a card game after all. Do you think you could decrease the luck by increasing the hand limit? Or would it make the diamond cards overpowered? Anyway this is just a first impression, so I might be wrong. üòÅ Let me know your thoughts!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/viiktor22"> /u/viiktor22 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1gw0818/regicide_is_very_fun/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1gw0818/regicide_is_very

Mindclash game that also has Battlestar Galactica elements which sounds like my absolute jam.

I&#39;m well aware that we can&#39;t force them to come to an agreement, but at least get them considering it. They may have already tried talking in the recent past and nothing came of it, but who knows.
