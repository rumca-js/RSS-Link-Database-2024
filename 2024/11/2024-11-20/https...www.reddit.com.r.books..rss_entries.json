Most recently, the book that I noticed first was called Deceptions by Michael Weaver. I chose it only because it had a cool cover - just a super close up negative shot of a nondescript woman&#39;s face. Here&#39;s a <a href=\"https://img.bobshop.co.za/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto:eco,c_fit,w_800,h_800,d_notfound.png/user_images/594/415594/240401105032_IMG_20240331_173838.jpg\">link</a> that shows the cover.</p> <p>However, pretty much everything else about the book seemed to be screaming &quot;pulpy, cheesy, cliche crime thriller.&quot; A typical story about an ex-mob guy getting mixed up in some mysterious drama thanks to an old friend he hasn&#39;t seen in years, you get the gist. I had extremely low expectations which were lowered even further when I tried to find out more about the book an", "id": 1548862, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gvjyut/who_is_michael_weaver_and_why_isnt_he_more_known", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 531, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/books/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Who is Michael Weaver and why isn't he more known???", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-11-20T00:22:17+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I was randomly surfing today and I saw a mention that The Ghost of Tom Joad is about one of the central characters in The Grapes of Wrath. </p> <p><span class=\"md-spoiler-text\">&gt;&gt;&quot;Tom Joad is a metaphorical \u201cghost,\u201d representing the continuing struggles of marginalized people in modern society.
