<p>This documentary meets the young people trying to fight against reproductive rights – and exposes the problems in their world view</p><p>Documentary-maker Poppy Jay’s new film has a title guaranteed to make my hackles rise, and perhaps the hackles of many others in a country that polls <a href="https://yougov.co.uk/politics/articles/47568-where-does-the-british-public-stand-on-abortion-in-2023">nearly 90% support</a> for a woman’s right to terminate a pregnancy: Young, British and Anti-Abortion. It’s an investigation into gen Z’s increasing presence among those who would seek to circumscribe or cancel that right. It looks at how they are looking to reposition the debate as a human rights issue rather than a religious one, and how they are emboldened by the overturning of Roe v Wade in the US two years ago. Jay meets a variety of young activists who hope that once again when the US sneezes, we will catch cold.</p><p>Eden McCourt does most of her work for Abortion Resistance through

<p>Trauma, terror and potential medical effects that last for generations – those who experienced the fallout of nukes in Australia and the Pacific tell their horrifying tale</p><p>Grenfell, the Post Office, infected blood, Hillsborough … Britain has witnessed a long series of injustices where walls of silence and lies have stopped the powerless inconveniencing the powerful by telling their whole truths. To that list, in the section where further disclosure is still urgently required, we should add the UK’s nuclear testing scandal. This calmly scathing documentary sets out the case.</p><p>Post-second world war, the US and the USSR engaged in a nuclear arms race, and Britain – desperate to cling to its place at the world’s top table – felt obliged to join them. As it tried to keep up with developments in atomic and hydrogen bombs, nuclear tests were desired, but letting off nukes anywhere near regular British citizens was politically unviable, so distant lands were sought and human gu

<p>The Republicans were always the party of big business, but Mr Trump is turning them into a playpen for oligarchs</p><p>One person turns up surprisingly often at Donald Trump’s side. Not his No 2, JD Vance, nor his wife, Melania, but another man a quarter-century younger and about $300bn heavier: Elon Musk. The two hunkered down in Mar-a-Lago on the night of the election, celebrating the results. This week they were in Texas, watching Mr Musk’s staff test-launch a spacecraft. During the campaign, Mr Musk <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-megadonors-2024-election/">personally chipped in $130m</a>, made speeches at rallies and organised campaigns to “get out the vote”.

<p>I don’t spend every night in my local. But even when I’m home, the knowledge that it exists makes life better</p><p>A closed pub is a sad, sad sight. Where once was life, people talking and laughing, now there is none. OK, bad stuff would have gone on too. I get that. Every pub has a drinker or two who needs the drink they’re holding more than they should. These places are, after all, potential vectors for dependence on a highly addictive substance, with all the misery that entails. But I think – hope – that pubs do more good than harm, that they’re more of a blessing than a curse.</p><p>Like most drinkers, I’m inclined to imagine that most of the population drink about the same as me, if not more, and in similar places. When the first lockdown was announced, including, unthinkably, the closing of pubs, Boris Johnson said he found it wrenching to be “taking away the ancient, inalienable right of free-born people of the United Kingdom to go to the pub”.

<p>There are some jaw-dropping moments in this story of a man who conned numerous women, but this quietly lo-thrills documentary lets the victims tell their stories</p><p>‘When he said he was in Toulouse for paediatric training, he was in Krakow seeing his other wife.” This is the moment when a Parisian woman called Marianne discovered that her partner had a second life. And a third, and a fourth … The Man With a Thousand Faces slots neatly into the mini-genre of dating scammer documentaries – but this is the French-intellectual version. There are some jaw-droppers in the story of how Ricardo (sometimes Alexandre or Daniel), a Portuguese (sometimes Argentinian or Brazilian) man conned numerous women. But it’s an emotionally literate, lo-thrills film from film-maker Sonia Kronlund, who casts actors to play some of the women to protect their privacy.</p><p>And really, it’s the women that Kronlund finds compelling. Marianne (played by Aurelie Gasche) had a baby with Ricardo, supposedly

<p>The Telegraph journalist sent a deeply offensive and inaccurate tweet. Yet she has won the support of a swath of newspapers, an ex-PM – and Elon Musk</p><p>The Allison Pearson saga is nothing if not a morality tale about the modern media. Among its many learnings are that calling a group of people of colour holding a flag on social media “<a href="https://archive.is/sekqM">Jew haters”</a> is likely to get you into trouble. Apparently, though, it can also make you best mates with the world’s richest man.</p><p>On Monday night, almost exactly a year after the Telegraph writer posted her response to a picture of police officers alongside two men holding a flag on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, she was offering her “huge thanks” to the site’s owner, Elon Musk, for his support. After he responded, she dubbed the billionaire with a powerful new job in the US government her “<a href="https://x.com/lsrlinda/status/1858646410532438437">new bestie ♥️</a>” in a post to her 191,50

<p>A classic roast bird with perfect sides, a vegetarian main of mushroom and pumpkin crespelle, and a speedy alternative to the traditional pudding – as simple as it is delicious</p><p>One of Angela Hartnett’s mantras for successful Christmas entertaining is “less is more”. Don’t serve a dozen different vegetables that nobody wants, or attempt some wildly ambitious culinary experiment on the most pressured cooking day of the year.</p><p>She doesn’t apply the same restraint to her own guest list. “Generally, I’m of the philosophy that if you’re cooking for five, you can cook for 15,” she says, though she and her partner Neil Borthwick, also a chef, often end up inviting even greater numbers to Christmas lunch. Sometimes, when there are 20-plus guests, they decamp to one of Hartnett’s London restaurants – Murano in Mayfair&nbsp;or Café Murano in Bermondsey – and take over the whole establishment.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/nov/20/parsnip-tarte-tatin-roast-turke
