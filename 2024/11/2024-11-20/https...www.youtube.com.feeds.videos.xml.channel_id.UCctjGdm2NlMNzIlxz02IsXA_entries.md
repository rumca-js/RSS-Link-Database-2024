It's been a year since I saw you guys, and what a year it has been! Rizzlers, Costco Guys, debates, streamers, baby oil, ocean trash, trading cards?! I can hardly contain myself. This video could have been twice as long, but I figured you might want a new video before 2035. So, here ya go!

I'm back at it again. So check out the patreon if ya can! Luv u long tyme!
