        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Good evening, First post on this sub, I hope I&#39;ll respect the rules :D I&#39;m going to make my own board game table and I have a few questions for people who have some! For the inside and outside rail system, I&#39;d like to use magnets (neodymium). What thickness of iron do you have for the magnets to be effective enough? What magnet strength is recommended (~1kg, 3kg, 5kg...)? For people who have been able to use this kind of system, have you ever had your magnetic accessories fall off?</p> <p>I&#39;m sharing with you the 3d plan I made (almost the first time in my life I&#39;ve used 3d software). <a href=\"https://app.sketchup.com/share/tc/europe/5O2p5mos_HE?stoken=acemKJw2SEevN_QQZ28fuITP2hprAcnAg3r4nKNbViknpmX-0QzPXiltNLAC66El&amp;source=web\">https://app.sketchup.com/share/tc/europe/5O2p5mos_HE?stoken=acemKJw2SEevN_QQZ28fuITP2hprAcnAg3r4nKNbViknpmX-0QzPXiltNLAC66El&amp;source=web</a></p> <p>Thank you in advance for your answers.</p> </div><!",

When I was just asking about it her reason was interesting -- she was just totally turned off by the darkness and theme, i.e. industrializing Britain. She legit found it depressing, which fair enough, it certainly would have been for the people actually slaving away in those coal pits..</p> <p>Anyway, I&#39;m wondering what people&#39;s recommendations are for games that have close to (I know no game can equal it!) that level of complexity with great playability, interaction, thoughtfulness of design, engine building, worker placement and evolving dynamics? Ideally it would have some kind of transport / network aspect but that&#39;s not necessary.</p> <p>What I really appreciate about Brass is that while it is a relatively complex game, everything works togethe",

The dice have sides composed of strengths wisdom, strength, and one other attribute, and I believe each class has their on dice. The dice vary based on the classes strength and have singles or doubles of the wisdom, strength, etc on them.

What would you add as a gateway game to round out the &quot;types&quot; of games that I own? I want to make sure I am not owning too many tile games as an example or maybe I am completely missing a &quot;type&quot; of game.

My intent was to play this game primarily at the 4p count that BGG recommends. I was thinking of taking it for a spin at 2p with just my wife to get the rules down. My concern, however, is that the design might be too antagonistic at 2p for her to enjoy and she\u2019ll be less inclined to try it with our couple friends at 4p. The 2p games we play have some interaction but often not direct conflict. I think in a group setting she would have fun with it (and I think they\u2019d all enjoy beating up on me in TR:V), so I\u2019m wondering if others feel like playing 2p might turn someone off from trying it at 4.</p> <p>As an aside, which modules do people start playing with on their first time?
