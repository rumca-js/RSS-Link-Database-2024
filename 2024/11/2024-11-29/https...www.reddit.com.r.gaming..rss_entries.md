<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I use to play games on normal or easy difficulty almost exclusively, as i found more joy in the world/story/lore than the gameplay in most single player games. However ever since I started playing games on the highest difficulty it made me realize how much better of an experience it can be if done right. The hardest difficulty was the way most games were meant to be played, forcing you to use strategy and actually think about the build of your character. It&#39;s also more immersive, adding the feeling of fear and suspense in tense situations. </p> <p>Grounded difficulty in The Last of Us Part 1 is the best example in my opinion. It was the most incredible/unforgiving experience I&#39;ve ever had in a game and something I recommend to everybody who&#39;s played the game to give a shot</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Bowiescorvat2"> /u/Bowiescorvat2 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com
