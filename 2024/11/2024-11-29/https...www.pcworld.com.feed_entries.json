I\u2019ve reviewed docking station deals at major retailers, comparing them to my extensive reviews of <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/393714/best-thunderbolt-docks-for-a-laptop-pc.html\">the best Thunderbolt docks</a> and my knowledge of their pricing. Even better, I explain <em>why</em> each deal is worth buying, with an emphasis on getting the most bang for your buck.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want more? I\u2019ve included a FAQ with more information: how to differentiate between the various standards, the price I\u2019d expect to pay, and more. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"best-black-friday-budget-thunderbo",

Whether you want to quickly transfer files between devices or just back up data in a cheap and portable format, you won\u2019t want to miss these discounts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before you do, you\u2019ll want to figure out how much storage space you need and what your budget is. While it\u2019s true that you\u2019ll have to pay more for greater capacity, the price-per-GB usually goes down, making it a better value to buy a bigger drive than you might need.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve gone ahead and done the deal hunting for you. Here are the best Black Friday flash drive sales I\u2019ve found, along with which one I\u2019d buy and why each recommended deal stands out. There\u2019s also a useful FAQ at the end in case you need more guidance before buying.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"best-black-friday-",
