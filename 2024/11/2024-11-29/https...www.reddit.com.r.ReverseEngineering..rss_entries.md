<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi guys , as the title says , I want to extract data from an apk i have installed on my phone .</p> <p>I tried various methods like apktool and apk easy tool and tried to access the data folder using adb but permission was denied .</p> <p>The process is fairly easy for someone who knows how to do it correctly because the information i want to extract is well visible.</p> <p>So my last hope is to find someone here help my with this task ( the data is a large set of strings ), Thanks in advance. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Long_Substance_286"> /u/Long_Substance_286 </a> <br/> <span><a href="http://facebook.com">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ReverseEngineering/comments/1h2thsx/i_need_some_to_help_me_extract_data_from_an_apk/">[comments]</a></span>
