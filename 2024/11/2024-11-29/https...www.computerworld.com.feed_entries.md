<p>The effort to re-shore chip manufacturing in the US could be in peril as a new presidential administration has signaled a shift in direction, all while a semiconductor industry seems at times to be struggling.</p>

<p>The case, filed with the Competition Tribunal, is the latest in a series of global legal challenges targeting Google’s advertising practices.</p>
