A 1-1 draw sees the tie finely balanced after an own goal from the Wales goalkeeper Olivia Clark cancelled out Lily Woodham’s opener.</p><p>This encounter caught the eye as soon as it became clear that these two close rivals would meet. Both have had differing fortunes in recent years.

Northern Ireland are the latest victims of that very scenario, after Norway cantered to a first leg win in Larne. There was at least proof, if necessary, that the European Championship will be a better place for the involvement of Caroline Graham Hansen. A major tournament without her would feel preposterous.</p><p>There were questions over how on earth Norway ended up in a playoff in the first place; Gemma Grainger’s team had shown their contempt for their necessary environment within 26 minutes, by which stage they were 3-0 ahead. It got no better for Northern Ireland thereafter. A deficit of four goals will prove insurmountable, barring a form of sporting miracle.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/29

<p>An overreliance on Guardiola’s genius has sent champions down a diverging path to Slot’s revamped Liverpool</p><p>On this week’s episode of the Rest is Football podcast, the Manchester City midfielder Rodri was asked if he ever fancies emulating Pep Guardiola and becoming a coach. “No,” comes the firm response. “I see Pep, and I don’t know if I want that for the next period of my life. I see Txiki’s face and I like it more. More clean and relaxed.”</p><p>Of course Rodri has made no secret in the past of his admiration for City’s director of football, Txiki Begiristain, and his desire to go down that career path after he retires. All the same, there is a faintly damning quality to his words. Imagine being so hard-working, so ruthlessly dedicated to your job, that even <em>Rodri</em> starts to think: whoa fella, bit much.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/29/manchester-citys-day-of-reckoning-is-coming-it-may-even-arrive-at-anfield">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘How do you sound like a sickly moon or a gigantic black butterfly?’: Schoenberg’s Pierrot Lunaire and its ‘sing-speech’

<p>The song cycle’s exploration of madness, death, sex and trauma redefined music – and singing. But how do you hiss, whisper and sing at the same time?</p><p>Schoenberg’s Pierrot Lunaire broke the mould of what both chamber music and singing could be. Scored for five musicians playing eight instruments between them and a singer instructed not to sing, it was the perfect musical manifestation of expressionism, the cultural movement of the early 1900’s where creatives across the disciplines sought to capture the essence of emotions rather than physical realities.</p><p>The work’s 21 poems explore themes of madness, death, sex, dreams, trauma and nostalgia through the character of Pierrot and his partners in crime, Harlequin and Columbine. The music – one of Schoenberg’s earliest moves towards atonality (the absence of a key, as we’d understand it) – can feel unsettling and haunting, yet has moments of breathtaking beauty, calm and a heady dose of romanticism to boot. However, it is th

Or, to be precise, ever since he ate his first spoon of Paxo sage and onion stuffing and gasped: “Qu’est-ce que c’est?!” Truth be told, it was a tough question to answer. Flavoured gravel that reminds me of Santa bringing a Sindy caravan set?

After meeting in a high school play, the band have made a dozen such albums since their 1989 debut, each based around frontwoman Karen Peris’s childlike, otherworldly vocal. On this exquisite 13th studio album, the sparse instrumentation and soft focus, lo-fi production gives the music an affectingly ethereal, distant quality, which the singer-songwriter says is intended to rekindle “the half-remembered beauty of singalongs of our 1970s childhoods”.</p><p>Her husband Don’s delicately strummed guitars, Mike Bitts’ gently plucked bass and occasional

Twenty people died earlier this week in four areas in North Sumatra province amid flash floods and landslides. On Thursday morning, another devastating landslide claimed seven more lives.

<p>From Galway to Venice, our tipsters choose their favourite places to stay which are near a train station</p><p>Venice is a place where you want to maximise your time and enjoy its unique atmosphere; a stay at the <strong>Hotel Abbazia</strong> let me do both last summer. The hotel is a former monastery, home to Carmelite monks in the 15th century, and is just a three-minute walk from Santa Lucia station. It has a lovely courtyard, perfect for reading a Donna Leon detective book and sipping a spritz while waiting for the evening train to Rome, as I did. The rooms have lovely classical paintings and polished wooden tables. You can also relax around the wood fire in the lounge where the monks used to have their Bible readings.<br><em>Doubles from €117, </em><em><a href="https://www.abbaziahotel.com/?stay_here=1">abbaziahotel.com</a></em><br><strong>Ann</strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2024/nov/29/hotel-near-railway-stations-europe-readers-tips">Continue readin

<p>Fraser Forster steps up for Spurs, while the threat level is at its highest for Manchester City at Anfield</p><p>Fabian Hürzeler singled out Joël Veltman as one of the Premier League’s most underrated players as Brighton prepare to face the bottom side, Southampton, on Friday. “He knows what to do to win games,” Hürzeler said of the Netherlands defender, who has started all but one of Brighton’s league games so far. Veltman – who spent eight years at Ajax before moving to the Amex in 2020 for £900,000 – is 11 months older than his manager and his experience has proved invaluable to his side in the absence of the captain, Lewis Dunk, through injury. He is expected to return against Russell Martin’s side as Brighton attempt to record a fourth clean sheet of the league season, not to mention take the opportunity to move into second place in the table before the rest of the weekend’s fixtures. <strong>Ed Aarons</strong></p><p><em>Brighton v Southampton, Friday 8pm (all times GMT)</em>
