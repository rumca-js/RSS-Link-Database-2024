<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I wrote a bot in nodejs that makes a request and gets a json as a response. It started as a webscraper using puppeteer but later I realized I could just make a fetch request and get the data that I needed, besides chrome uses too many resources and could only get 4 instances running at the same time in this old pc that I&#39;m using as a server.</p> <p>I was using surfshark as a VPN and I had the script containerized with docker, so each container would connect to a different vpn, make 10 requests and then connect to a different server. The response has an Age header that resets every 30 seconds so the script waits accordingly in order to get a fresh response each time before connecting to a different server.</p> <p>The thing is surfshark blocked my account because they don&#39;t allow webscraping. I was kind of greedy I guess because I had 24 containers running, each one connected to a different location and rotating all day between servers.</p> <p>
