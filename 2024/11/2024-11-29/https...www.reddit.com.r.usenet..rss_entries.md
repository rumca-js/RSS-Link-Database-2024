I called my card company they said two transactions 5.98 and 6 euros lol. Only 5.98 has been approved by CC so does it take time for transaction approval from provider.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been receiving a lot of Usenet ads in my email lately. Some of you might suggest just unsubscribing, but I&#39;m curious—since most Usenet providers no longer offer lifetime packages, are any of them still worth using for a new user? I&#39;m also open to hearing about any other lifetime deals from reliable providers (as long as they&#39;re solid, of course!).
