<p>Black Friday has officially made its way onto the scene, and with it comes loads of steep discounts on laptops.

<p>Not only did this laptop earn 4.5 stars out of 5 and our Editors’ Choice award, but it also snagged the top spot in PCWorld’s <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/436674/the-best-pc-laptops-of-the-year.html">best laptops roundup</a>.

<p>Black Friday is here, and we’re seeing some amazing deals on monitors. For example, you can score this MSI 27-inch OLED gaming monitor with 1440p resolution and 240Hz of refresh for just <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/msi-mag271qpxqdolede2-27-oled-qhd-240hz-0-03ms-adaptive-syncgaming-monitor-with-hdr400-displayport-hdmi-usb-c-black/6583876.p?skuId=6583876">$499.99 at Best Buy</a> and <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/196507421426">Best Buy’s eBay store</a>. That’s $200 off its retail price and one of the lowest prices we’ve ever seen for an OLED display, much less one with an ultra-fast refresh rate! </p>



<p>The MSI MAG 271QPX is designed to be a fantastic, gaming-focused OLED screen without a lot of extras. 240Hz at 2560×1440 hits the “sweet spot” for a 27-inch monitor, offering a little extra sharpness for high-end AAA games and plenty of spee

<p>For just $280, the Lenovo IdeaPad 1 with a Ryzen 5 CPU is a steal! That’s a <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/lenovo-ideapad-1-15-fhd-laptop-ryzen-5-7520u-16gb-memory-with-256gb-ssd-storage-abyss-blue/6588662.p?skuId=6588662">whopping $300 off its original $580 price tag at Best Buy</a>.</p>



<p>This is the perfect laptop for anyone who wants an affordable machine with decent speed without breaking the bank. The Lenovo IdeaPad 1 runs on the Ryzen 5 7520U processor and 16GB of DDR5 RAM. That’s enough to run plenty of apps, stream content, and even do some casual gaming.</p>



<p>There’s only 256GB of storage space on this one, but given how affordable portable SSDs are nowadays, that’s not going to be an issue. Just plug in an external drive to boost your overall capacity.</p>



<p>The laptop features a 15.6-inch 1080p screen, which is plenty to ge

<p>You don’t need incredible, teeth-rattling power for a desktop, even a gaming desktop. But you do need something better than the crappy little five-watt nothings that are included in your monitor.</p>



<p>For Black Friday, Amazon has the bookshelf speakers that I personally use in my own setup on sale. I’m talking about the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Edifier-R1280T-Powered-Bookshelf-Speakers/dp/B016P9HJIA/">Edifier R1280T speakers for just $84</a>, which is 30 percent off its $120 retail price.</p>



<p>These speakers have been a staple of PC power users for years, and you’ll see them all over communities like Reddit’s /r/battlestations. They sound great, with crystal-clear mids and a bit of bass power without needing a separate subwoofer. With 42 watts, four-inch primary drivers, and 13mm tweeters, it’s powerful enough to fill an office easily wit

<p>This Acemagician mini PC is the most affordable it’s ever been this Black Friday, with the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Computers-Windows-Display-Desktop-Bluetooth/dp/B0BQHBWPYX/">price dropping to $239 at Amazon</a>, just over 31 percent off its already low MSRP. Considering the impressive configuration and the low price, this is an absolute bargain.</p>



<p>So, first of all, this Acemagician model features an AMD Ryzen 7 5825U CPU and 16GB of DDR4 RAM, which will deliver impressive OS loading times, quick app multitasking, and more. This makes this tiny device a true productivity powerhouse. Oh, and if you want to, you can upgrade to 64GB of RAM later because it’s so accessible.</p>



<p>The mini PC features a 512GB SSD on board, which is already quite a lot, especially at this price point. Should you want to, however, you can swap out the SSD and

<p>Adobe Creative Cloud apps may dominate for image and video work, but its ongoing subscriptions can cost a pretty penny. You could go the free route—or instead grab a fantastic deal on a solid, well-liked alternative for as little as $9.</p>



<p>For Black Friday, Serif is selling its <a href="https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/">Affinity Photo 2, Designer 2, and Publisher 2 software</a> at 50 percent off. You pay just one time for the software license (no subscriptions to deal with!) for these analogs of Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign, respectively. And you can choose to buy the app for one platform (e.g., Windows only) or a Universal License that grants access to all apps and platforms.</p>

<p>Normally $300, this chair pops up regularly in recommendations on Reddit, including r/buildapc.

<p>The $199.99 Acer Chromebook Plus deal at Costco is by far the best Chromebook deal for Black Friday, and you can get it even if you aren’t a member of the discount club. “Chromebook Plus” signals a premium device, and this Chromebook can be yours at a true bargain price.</p>



<p>Costco’s <a href="https://www.costco.com/.product.4000252543.html">$199.99 deal on the 14-inch Acer Chromebook Plus</a> was discovered by my colleague Alaina Yee as she was poring through the discount retailer for a personal purchase. </p>

<p>We reviewed the Kensington Thunderbolt 4 and gave it a 4-star rating and our Editors’ Choice award. We appreciated the rugged and well-engineered build, as well as the fact that you can place it vertically to save some space.</p>



<p>The thing we loved the most, however, was that we could add four 4K displays to our setup. Yes, four of them! Alternatively, you can hook up a single 8K display.</p>

<p>High-quality photography is a vital tool in developing your career, business, or hobby, whether that means professional-looking headshots or crisp product photos. Does that mean you have to pay for expensive studio sessions? Not necessarily.</p>



<p>The single biggest difference between amateur and professional photography is the background. Without proper studio facilities, shots tend to be cluttered and unevenly lit, which draws attention away from the subject and gives a sloppy impression. You can use software to separate foreground and background, enabling you to place the subject against a plain backdrop, but this isn’t as simple as it sounds.</p>

<p>Microsoft insists you to use a Microsoft account when setting up a brand-new Windows PC, but what if you don’t want to? Fortunately, Windows 11 (Home 24H2) works in the same way previous Windows 11 iterations used to–without a Microsoft account or the need to go online. It’s not straightforward however, and you need to pull off a couple of simply technical tricks to make it happen when you’re setting up your computer.</p>



<p>The best way to do this is to use <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows11" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the official ISO file from Microsoft</a> to install Windows 11 24H2 or create a USB stick for the installation. You can do this with official tools and sources from Microsoft. Additional tools aren’t even necessary, as everything can be done during the installation.</p>

<p>The yearly fray of Black Friday consumerism is upon us. Yet, as I’ve been covering monitor deals in the days leading up to the post-turkey blitz, I’ve gotta say… this year’s deals are <em>especially</em> delicious. That’s doubly true if you’re searching for an OLED monitor upgrade, because we’re seeing the lowest prices <em>ever</em> for that expensive category.</p>



<p>We’ve checked all of the deals below for accuracy, value, and, you know, whether they’re actually worth getting in the first place. (We have decades of experience with monitor reviews, so we know our stuffing.) Since deals often come and go as promotions expire or stock runs out, we’ll also be regularly updating our deal picks to make sure they’re fresh.</p>

<p>Deals in these categories don’t always fly as fast and furious, but a solid handful are worth looking at. We’ve pulled together our list based on user reviews, technical specs, price trends over the year, and feedback from the PCWorld staff.</p>
