Logic suggests we improve over time, but the metrics don\u2019t support that assumption.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A cloud project 10 years ago typically involved migrating a few test programs and systems. Now, the systems involved are much more complex, with many more moving parts that affect multiple or all aspects of an enterprise\u2019s operations. Today\u2019s push toward AI means that complicated, data-intensive systems are now the preferred models for cloud systems. Due to the skills shortage and planning problems, these complex systems present significant obstacles to enterprise cloud adoption even on a good day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We need to",
