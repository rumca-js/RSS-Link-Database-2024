A new study has provided further evidence that the deaths of 350 African elephants in Botswana during 2020 were the result of drinking from water holes where toxic algae populations had exploded due to climate change.

Bacteria modify their ribosomes when exposed to widely used antibiotics, according to new research. The modified ribosomes have changes specifically in the regions where antibiotics latch on to and halt protein production. The study found this made the bacteria more resistant to the drugs. The subtle changes might be enough to alter the binding site of drug targets and constitute a possible new mechanism of antibiotic resistance.

## Strategies for safe and equitable access to water: A catalyst for global peace and security

Water can be a catalyst for peace and security with a critical role in preventing conflicts and promoting cooperation among communities and nations -- but only if managed equitably and sustainably.

## Sea anemone study shows how animals stay 'in shape'

Some animals, such as the starlet sea anemone, can regenerate large parts of their body, even after major injuries. Researchers have shown this regeneration response involves cells and molecules in body parts far from the injury site and is directed towards restoring the animal's original shape. The study sheds new light on the fundamental importance of maintaining body shape in animals and enhances our understanding of the molecular pathways involved in regeneration.
