								<p>If you’ve yet to play<strong> Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</strong>, you’re in luck! As Black Friday rolled into town, it brought with it the largest discount the game has ever seen. This 20% reduction is available via Humble Bundle and will remain up throughout the duration of the Black Friday period. It brings the price down below $50 / £45, which is pretty cool considering the game is only a couple of months old.</p>

								<p>X.com owner Elon Musk has expressed an interest in purchasing Hasbro, the corporate owner of Wizards of the Coast and ultimately the <strong>Dungeons and Dragons</strong> license. With an estimated personal worth of $323 billion, Musk could singlehandedly fund the establishment of a dozen RPG studios - surely a red-blooded capitalist would find it much more fulfilling to launch his own bold vision of tabletop gaming into the market, to conquer the current ‘woke’ version of DnD?</p>
