Chuck Schumer is seldom thought of as an oracle of political precognition, but we have to hand it to the longtime Democratic senator from New York: On Oct. 17, at the Alfred E.

One of the more likable qualities of the clunkily titled Cher: The Memoir, Part One is that its author appears to have taken great delight in writing it. Cher guides the reader through the first half of her inimitable life and career with chutzpah. She begins with her impoverished and often miserable childhood in California, [&#8230;]

Is Lewis Carroll’s Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland (1865) a philosophical analysis of language, a political allegory of liberal overreach, or a Menippean satire that, by following curiosity over the edge of logic, exposes legal order as a word game, proving nothing but its own emptiness? You know from the question that the answer is “All of the [&#8230;]

The 2024 elections seem to be, at least for now, proof that Americans have rejected woke liberal messaging.

With just over 50 days remaining until Donald Trump takes office once again, the president-elect has been beefing up his incoming administration with nominees and appointees that can advance the Republican’s oil and gas-focused energy agenda.  With a Republican majority in the House and Senate, Trump is not expected to face many hurdles from Congress [&#8230;]

Senators may still have some real substantive concerns about President-elect Donald Trump’s decision to nominate Robert F.

Here is a tale of two once-great cities. They lost their steel mills and auto plants. The factories went quiet. The populations dwindled. In spite of that, they never lost their football teams, which became sources of ragged pride amid snowy desolations. Now, these survivors stand at the edge of something spectacular.

The Syrian Civil War reignited after four years of docility when a rebel coalition launched a surprise offensive against Syrian government positions outside of Aleppo.

The national average price for a gallon of regular gas decreased slightly on Thanksgiving, dropping to $3.065 from Wednesday’s price of $3.073, according to AAA.  Thursday’s cost was essentially the same as a week ago, when a gallon of regular gas was $3.063.

Politicians and their ghostwriters regularly churn out books in many different well-worn genres, including memoirs, policy manifestos, and novels. Still, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries’s (D-NY) latest book, published in November by Grand Central Publishing after his party’s stinging losses in House, Senate, and White House elections, is a departure from what his predecessors would [&#8230;]
