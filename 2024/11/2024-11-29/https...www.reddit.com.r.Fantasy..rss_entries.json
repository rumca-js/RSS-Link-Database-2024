So I am commenting things from earlier parts.</p> <p>I wanted to adress the male vs female trope in the series, which is pretty explicit. In the beginning it was kind of funny, but as the books went by, it became VERY tiresome. Men weren&#39;t so extremely bad, but there were parts of the series where I just couldn&#39;t stand the women. Nynaeve and Elaine missions were peak exhaustion for me. I think I had nightmares with how much I hated Nynaeve. It got better towards the end of the series though.</p> <p>I think it is an interesting trope to develop, but I have mixed feelings about how well Jordan pulled it off. Tbh, I don&#39;t know if I just got used to it towards the end (kind of getting used to Astas screaming in Black Clover lol), or if Sanderson just did a much better job at being subtle. Maybe Jordan wanted it to be the obvious sympton of an underlying broken world, ",

At first, I really liked the atmosphere. It\u2019s not entirely original, but I enjoyed how the protagonist was introduced: a woman, not a teen, who isn\u2019t the typical hero. She\u2019s weak, doesn\u2019t know how to fight, but still manages to be the best. And, a writer who isn\u2019t afraid to kill off characters? I loved that, It felt like an adult book</p> <p>But then... the romance started. It felt unnecessary, toxic, and detrimental to the protagonist. Most of the time, it seems like an obstacle that keeps me from fully enjoying the story. Somehow, it feels as if he\u2019s the real protagonist and the sex scenes during the most intense moments completely ruined the books for me.</p> <p>I wanted to know your thoughts on this... Maybe you can help me see this from a different perspective to be able to complete them? or mayb",

I am about halfway through book 3and I was met with a character detail that changes my entire head Canon on how the Travailians appear. Most of the 3 books they were described, in my mind, as very Viking-like. So I had an image of their people, structures, amd all forms of their civilization. Well all of a sudden in book 3 there is a detail given that the Dragon Riders of Travail have dark skin. Now, I don&#39;t have an issue with this at all.

Conan is never saving the world, or going to war with the devil himself. These kinds of over-the-top stakes turn me off from books like Wheel of Time for example. Popular sci-fi like Dune (I&#39;ve only seen the movies) again turns me off with the idea of &quot;saviors&quot; and &quot;prophecies&quot; and entire planets and races being at stake. Before I got into fantasy I used to read more Westerns, where the stakes were always personal and limited. Someone is getting run off their land or recovering a captured relative or fighting over the rights to a mine, etc.</p> <p>Something like the Firefly series comes to mind (not sure if they&#39;re based on books) but less campy. </p> <p><strong>Conan in the future? John Wayne in space? Does such a thing exist?</strong></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <",

I know it\u2019s not a lot to go on but I can say I enjoy when the characters some cool abilities and I also like when there\u2019s some sort of political struggle such as in \u201cfire and blood\u201d and \u201cred queen\u201d series. Any recommendation is appreciated they don\u2019t need to have the political struggle or MC with abilities that was just things that seem to be the common denominator for the books I\u2019ve listed</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Masterofwar21\"> /u/Ma",
