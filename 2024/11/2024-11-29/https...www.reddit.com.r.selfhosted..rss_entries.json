I\u2019m using Nginx Proxy Manager for getting Let\u2019s Encrypt certificates for my domain through DNS 01 challenge just for 2 services. Nextcloud (because, without https, iOS will refuse to sync Contacts-Calendars) and Vaultwarden.</p> <p>I don\u2019t want to continue paying for domain for just two services. I\u2019ve tried duckdns but there were a lot of times that duckdns was down. </p> <p>I want to use the most simple way of getting https for these two services with local domain. As I understand, I\u2019m gonna use pihole for the local domain and something like caddy for getting the self signed certificates that I will use on all my devices. What is the most easy way (no time at all with work and family) to do this? And how often will the certificates expire? </p> <p>Thank you very much for your help. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Substantia",
