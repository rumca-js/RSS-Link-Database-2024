<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>First of all: I HAVEN&#39;T FINISHED THE LAST BOOK, PLEASE DON&#39;T SPOIL. So I am commenting things from earlier parts.</p> <p>I wanted to adress the male vs female trope in the series, which is pretty explicit. In the beginning it was kind of funny, but as the books went by, it became VERY tiresome. Men weren&#39;t so extremely bad, but there were parts of the series where I just couldn&#39;t stand the women. Nynaeve and Elaine missions were peak exhaustion for me. I think I had nightmares with how much I hated Nynaeve. It got better towards the end of the series though.</p> <p>I think it is an interesting trope to develop, but I have mixed feelings about how well Jordan pulled it off. Tbh, I don&#39;t know if I just got used to it towards the end (kind of getting used to Astas screaming in Black Clover lol), or if Sanderson just did a much better job at being subtle. Maybe Jordan wanted it to be the obvious sympton of an underlying broken world,

At first, I really liked the atmosphere. It’s not entirely original, but I enjoyed how the protagonist was introduced: a woman, not a teen, who isn’t the typical hero. She’s weak, doesn’t know how to fight, but still manages to be the best. And, a writer who isn’t afraid to kill off characters? I loved that, It felt like an adult book</p> <p>But then... the romance started. It felt unnecessary, toxic, and detrimental to the protagonist. Most of the time, it seems like an obstacle that keeps me from fully enjoying the story. Somehow, it feels as if he’s the real protagonist and the sex scenes during the most intense moments completely ruined the books for me.</p> <p>I wanted to know your thoughts on this... Maybe you can help me see this from a different perspective to be able to complete them? or mayb

Recommendations for such a theme, in the form of novels or series is appreciated. </p> <p>There&#39;s a series called The Keys Of The Kingdom.

## Recommendations for science fiction that reads like Conan? A "space-western"? Or any modern fantasy that isn't overly ambitious in its stakes and scope?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>One of the things I enjoy about a lot of the gritty old-school fantasy that I&#39;ve read is that the stakes aren&#39;t overly ambitious. Conan is never saving the world, or going to war with the devil himself. These kinds of over-the-top stakes turn me off from books like Wheel of Time for example. Popular sci-fi like Dune (I&#39;ve only seen the movies) again turns me off with the idea of &quot;saviors&quot; and &quot;prophecies&quot; and entire planets and races being at stake. Before I got into fantasy I used to read more Westerns, where the stakes were always personal and limited. Someone is getting run off their land or recovering a captured relative or fighting over the rights to a mine, etc.</p> <p>Something like the Firefly series comes to mind (not sure if they&#39;re based on books) but less campy. </p> <p><strong>Conan in the future? John Wayne in space? Does such a thing exist?</strong></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m trying to remember a book I read almost 20 years ago, when I was around 15yo, so the details are a little fuzzy to me. It was adult, not YA. I don&#39;t remember any of the main plot except that I think the MC was taken prisoner by some kind of vampire? He might not have been...I feel like he might have had wings. </p> <p>Anyway, the one scene I remember was towards the end when he was dying because his heart was frozen(?) or something. So MC cut out his heart and replaced it with her own. Then he comes back to life, and thaws out his heart and gives it to her, and he&#39;s like, &quot;why didn&#39;t she just do this?&quot; because I guess she was an idiot and could have just thawed his heart instead of cutting hers from her chest? Or idk something weird like that.</p> <p>Feels like a fever dream, but l&#39;m 97% sure this is an actual book that I read. Does anyone know what it is??</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="h

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>For me it has to be the ending of Lions of Al-Rassan. Just the culmination of the moment and the complex relationships and ties that the characters have.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Sea_Priority_4652"> /u/Sea_Priority_4652 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1h2aoc6/what_is_the_hardest_decision_youve_seen/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1h2aoc6/what_is_the_hardest_decision_youve_seen/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Over the years I&#39;ve used different methods or software to track the books I&#39;ve read. Mostly tracking how many per year, but at times, words per month, etc. Naturally I&#39;ve ready my fair share of fantasy, science fiction, etc. Now I&#39;ve been thinking about compiling a list for my son and more or less am trying to give him some different pathways he can explore if he chooses to.</p> <p>My question for the community is this. Based on the list that I currently have what is one essential series you would add to my list that is not already part of what I have? I have broke it down into multiple categories, but it is not perfect, as you&#39;ll see with the placement of the Cosemere for example. I realize there will probably be some different interpretations on what&#39;s what so if you have suggestions on placement or orders I&#39;m open to suggestions! </p> <p><strong>Young Fantasy:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Narnia</li> <li>Redwall</li> <li>Lost

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Books I’ve liked: Michael vey (only read first 7 books, I didn’t know the author made more after “The Final Spark”) </p> <p>The red queen series </p> <p>Percy Jackson series</p> <p>Hero’s of Olympus series </p> <p>Fourth wing </p> <p>Fire and blood </p> <p>Chronicles of Vladimir Tod (I read this is middle school don’t know if it’s actually good but I enjoyed it at the time) </p> <p>Based on these books I’ve read and enjoyed do yall have any recommendations? I know it’s not a lot to go on but I can say I enjoy when the characters some cool abilities and I also like when there’s some sort of political struggle such as in “fire and blood” and “red queen” series. Any recommendation is appreciated they don’t need to have the political struggle or MC with abilities that was just things that seem to be the common denominator for the books I’ve listed</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Masterofwar21"> /u/Ma
