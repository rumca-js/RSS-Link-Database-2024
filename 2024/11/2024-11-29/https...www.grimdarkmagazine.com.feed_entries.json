        "description": "<p>After Games Workshop scythed through the online fanimation community with job offers and take down notices a few years back, I am so happy to see Warhammer 40,000 fan projects back on YouTube. Scorch by creator Moskoni is the first in what I hope is a long series of episodes, the opening battle salvo of a mass attack by the Cadians to destroy a Chaos cardinal and his followers. Scorch is a relatively simple story so far. A daring mass assault to gain access to a horrifying leader and his minions to stop them from doing future terrible things to the people of the Imperium in the future. Story, however, is not what this episode, nor this review is about. Scorch is an impressive\u00a0spectacle, with a breathtaking approach to depicting mass battle by the men and women of the Astra Militarum. From the terrified breathing of a pilot as he flies troops into the warzone, to a scene where a desperately needed missile team runs past guardsmen carrying wounded soldiers away from the front lines,",
