        "description": "Ridley Scott's Alien Franchise might be one of the most confusing and convoluted cinematic universes put to film.  Having had multiple directors, prequels, sequels, and some retconning, the Alien Franchise timeline can seem confusing to even the most hardcore fan.  So after the original Alien trilogy, two prequels, a match up against Predator, and a new installment into the series, what exactly is going on in the world of Alien?
