<img src="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/eg_odWFUTG.png?width=1920&height=1920&fit=bounds&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp" /> <p>Sony's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PlayStation 5 Pro</a> is the most capable console money can buy right now, so it's only right that we should see Epic's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> receive a substantial upgrade. The Pro's extra rasterisation performance is put to good use in delivering higher resolutions up against the standard model, but that's not really the game-changing difference. Instead, Epic deploys its higher end hardware ray tracing features to the 60fps mode of the game, offering a much improved level of global illumination and reflections - and it does so while maintaining its nigh-on flawless performance level. It's also interesting to note that one of Sony's 'big three' enhancements <em>isn't</em> used. Epic prefers its own Temporal Super Resoluti

<img src="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/threshold-screenshot.jpg?width=1920&height=1920&fit=bounds&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp" /> <p>Threshold is the kind of horror game that keeps just enough at arm's length to really set your mind ablaze while you're playing. After landing a coveted job with the government, the game begins as you prepare to take on your first shift looking after an important maintenance post just outside the city walls. But before you even arrive, it's clear that something's a bit off. A low, angry and muffled voice directs you into a lift. There's an oxygen meter to your left, and as you start the long ascent up to the surface you watch your supply dwindle away to almost nothing. The air is thin up here, so much so that the clerk you're relieving, a no-nonsense chap called Mo, speaks to you via hastily written notes, as talking simply involves too much effort.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/threshold-review">Read more</a></p>
