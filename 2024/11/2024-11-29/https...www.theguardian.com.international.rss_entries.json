Northern Ireland are the latest victims of that very scenario, after Norway cantered to a first leg win in Larne.

The loquacious New Yorker spoke about his disappointment with himself and his level of play and how difficult it had become to balance family life and a pro tennis career.

Veltman \u2013 who spent eight years at Ajax before moving to the Amex in 2020 for \u00a3900,000 \u2013 is 11 months older than his manager and his experience has proved invaluable to his side in the absence of the captain, Lewis Dunk, through injury. He is expected to return against Russell Martin\u2019s side as Brighton attempt to record a fourth clean sheet of the league season, not to mention take the opportunity to move into second place in the table before the rest of the weekend\u2019s fixtures. <strong>Ed Aarons</strong></p><p><em>Brighton v Southampton, Friday 8pm (all times GMT)</em>",
