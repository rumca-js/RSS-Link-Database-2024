<p>MPs advanced the proposed bill. With ethical dilemmas and practical safeguards under scrutiny, challenges still remain unresolved</p><p>On Friday, MPs <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/nov/29/mps-vote-for-assisted-dying-in-england-and-wales">voted</a> to advance legislation on assisted dying in England and Wales, reflecting polling that shows widespread public support. However, a slim majority, of less than one-tenth of the House, should temper the confidence of its proponents. This is a profound, historic decision that demands careful consideration. Parliament was at its best in putting through the proposals to the next stage of deliberation. The debate was marked by sobriety and the welcome absence of partisan bickering. MPs approached the issue with humility, showing respect for every contribution, regardless of stance.</p><p>The central tension between individual autonomy and societal responsibility was clearly highlighted by the discussion.

<p>The emotion on display during five hours of heated discussion speaks to the complexity and importance of the bill itself</p><p>Who would have guessed? All too often debates in the Commons are partisan affairs, punctuated by jeers and braying. Where reason is superseded by dogma and ill-temper. This was a very different occasion. Parliament on its very best behaviour. Where necessary, people – mostly politely – agreeing to disagree. MPs heard in silence. Some in tears. Even more remarkable was the feeling there was intelligent life on view. The quality of argument was a cut above the average.</p><p>There again, this was no ordinary debate. Most Fridays, Westminster is a ghost town with MPs back home minding their constituencies. But this was an exception. The day when a private member’s bill to legalise assisted dying for terminally ill people took its first step to becoming law. When some men and women of faith tried to imagine making laws for those of no faith.</p><p><em>Taking t

<p>Marvel has decided to take Anthony Mackie’s Sam Wilson right back to the superhero stone age with its latest iteration, in which he will basically have no power at all</p><p>There’s a weird thing about superheroes. They tend to be a little bit more intriguing when they actually have superpowers. Yes, there is the odd exception: Batman has managed to navigate a Gotham City filled with supervillains who vacillate between the distinctly non-magical (Penguin, Carmine Falcone) and the utterly bonkers (Poison Ivy, Clayface), without having any powers of his own – unless you count his uncanny ability to weaponise extreme wealth and a voice like he has been gargling gravel.

<p>‘Important shift’ made in global attempts to address plastic pollution though final treaty text yet to be agreed</p><p>Pressure from an increasingly large bloc of countries has offered hope that a breakthrough at critical international plastic treaty talks could be in sight at last on Friday, after two years of deadlock. But some warned that fragile progress could disappear again in the last stages of negotiations over the weekend.</p><p>For some time the talks have been split over demands for the treaty to include plans to reduce the amount of plastic which is being produced – a production cap. A draft text for a final deal published on Friday included language for a global target to reduce the amount of plastic made. But it also included another option for no text – meaning no action would be taken to reduce plastic production worldwide. The final text, using one of these options, will hopefully be agreed over the weekend.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/202

<p>Win at Newcastle suggests team are locating an identity but they still have plenty to prove – starting against Arsenal</p><p>This could have been the week that finished Julen Lopetegui at West Ham. Given two weeks to save his job, the manager met the challenge head on in the first and lifted the pressure by masterminding a disciplined, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/25/newcastle-west-ham-premier-league-match-report">clever 2-0 victory</a> at Newcastle on Monday.</p><p>Here, after a series of underwhelming performances, was belated evidence of why West Ham replaced David Moyes with Lopetegui in the summer. Internally there was satisfaction that the international break had not been used to make a change. West Ham, who go into Saturday evening’s home game with Arsenal in a curious spot, six points above the bottom three and seven off the top four, can see how hard Lopetegui has been working to reverse the slump. Although their faith has been tested, they were 

## Here’s one way to slash Britain’s rate of child poverty: stop dithering and make all fathers pay what’s due | Polly Toynbee

<p>A new report shows a bad situation is getting worse. This really is a case for draconian action from the state</p><p>Men don’t pay and won’t pay. Governments for more than 30 years have failed abysmally to make fathers pay for their children. The latest report, following a long line of them, shows how few fathers are paying maintenance, and how many separated mothers are giving up in despair. Child poverty has risen to 44% in single-parent households, but when children do receive maintenance it cuts the child poverty rate by 25%. Why does the state fail to collect on children’s behalf?</p><p>The long and sorry saga of the Child Support Agency began in 1993. It was disastrously mismanaged from the start, arousing maximum rage with rebellious fathers’ protests for minimum actual collection of cash. When it was shut down, billions in arrears owed to mothers and children were simply wiped clean, never collected. The Child Maintenance Service (CMS) that replaced it has done no better.

<p>Hardy varieties of these legumes can be grown through winter. Just remember to protect them from the weather</p><p>Despite my most recent columns being about how plants tend to stop growing at this time of&nbsp;year and what to do during the dormant winter period, there are some that – somewhat miraculously – defy these seasonal patterns.

<p>Campaigners on both sides dub the bill ‘a matter of conscience’ – but profound ethical issues can’t be reduced to right v wrong</p><p></p><p>Life moves slow until, suddenly, it doesn’t. The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/sep/11/mps-begin-debate-assisted-dying-bill">last time MPs voted on assisted dying</a> was in 2015, with the next decade marked by near silence on the issue, as Brexit and austerity dominated the agenda. On Friday, a mere 18 days after the legislation was first published, MPs will vote on the landmark terminally ill adults (end of life) bill that could, in time, see the right to die become law in England and Wales.</p><p>None of this will feel fast enough for the late-stage cancer patients waiting for the autonomy to die as they choose, of course, not least those for whom it has come too late to end their suffering, or the loved ones who had to helplessly watch. And yet by any other definition, it is hard to escape the sense that the bill has be

<p>This dramatisation of the sportsperson’s life seems to be on a quest to follow every single trope of racing dramas. The car sequences are thrilling, but it’s a bland eulogy whose characters are woefully underexplored</p><p>Bio-dramas – so vulnerable to cliche when they celebrate sporting heroes – are hard to get right even when they’re not competing with a definitive documentary on the subject. Senna, Netflix’s drama about the life and premature death of Brazilian motor racing superstar Ayrton Senna, arrives in the shadow of Asif Kapadia’s 2010 documentary feature of the same name, so it starts with a disadvantage. It has, however, six hour-long episodes to play with. What deeper new angles can it find?</p><p>Unfortunately, the answer is: none. This is a straightforward eulogising of the great sportsman that makes him seem more straightforward a character than he actually was, and relegates everyone in his life to a flat cartoon. The race sequences are thrilling and the narrative

<p>The film adaptation of Rachel Yoder’s 2021 novel offers a whip-smart depiction of motherhood – and some icky body horror. Its director and star talk awful husbands, menstrual blood and canine transformation</p><p>I have to be careful describing the film Nightbitch. Not&nbsp;because of spoilers, but because there is a very real danger I will walk through it frame by frame. And not because it’s flawless in its depiction of motherhood in the early years – what it does to the self, to relationships, to the body, to one’s orientation to the world. Rather, because I have never seen it told on screen, from the mother’s point of view, with anything like this accuracy.</p><p>“Becoming a mother is such an overidealised moment in culture,” says its director, Marielle Heller, words tumbling over those of her star, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/amy-adams">Amy Adams</a>, when I meet them in London. “And then when you go through it, you’re like: ‘What?!
