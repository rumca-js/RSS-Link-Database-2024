<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi. Currently I have a Hisense 50in Roku tv from Walmart. It’s good but I plan to return it to get a TCL 65” that’s on sale. Anyway, both are Roku devices so I’d just be getting them as a display.</p> <p>My question is, is it better to use my PC for streaming, or to use an android OS box. </p> <p>I actually have a 4K Onn Box (the $50 one) but I don’t understand side loading or whatever needs to be done to make it work for me. My PC is a lot more intuitive but I want to be able to take full advantage of stuff like 4K quality and I don’t think the websites I use on my PC do that.</p> <p>Most posts I’ve read mention Streamio as the way to go, so alternative question is would using that service on my PC or a Onn Box be better? thanks for reading. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/tjmaxx501"> /u/tjmaxx501 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1h29ah5/pc_or_tv_box_for_stream
