<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Question please. I’m hitting a tomcat 403 error, stating invalid or missing CRSF token. I’m grabbing a fresh token for the request, but no good. I believe there’s an Akami waf but using the standard bypass of characters for this. Does anyone have an idea how to finesse this please?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/sendersclu8"> /u/sendersclu8 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1h2g091/csrfwaf_issues/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1h2g091/csrfwaf_issues/">[comments]</a></span>
