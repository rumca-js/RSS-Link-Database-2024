I really love the Genre but i&#39;m having bad luck with my picks recently.</p> <p>As far as my taste: Ofcourse LoTR is the goat. I don&#39;t like Brandon Sanderson (so i won&#39;t be finishing wheel of time) I hated Jade city John Gwynne is ok (I&#39;ve read the first book of faithful and fallen series and it was like 6.5-7/10. ) Joe Abercrombie is ok. First law was fine. (Not the best thing i&#39;ve ever read, and certainly not worth all the hype, but it was good) And I really like Robin Hobbs prose and story telling. Black leopard, red wolf was a great read as well, but i haven&#39;t heard many good things about the second book.</p> <p>Everytime i&#39;ve took a suggestion from booktok or booktube i&#39;ve been extremely disappointed. Looking for new suggestions or maybe lesser known books, those hidden gems you&#39;ve found and really liked. Thank you!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.",

Social media was also a big factor. Recently, I deleted all my social media (except Reddit) on my phone and wanted to reignite my reading interest.</p> <p>I used to like detective/crime and a light romance novel. I also loved Harry Potter. A few years before I stopped reading, I liked to read autobiographies and popular science (I\u2019m a computer scientist working in biomedical research). I read a lot of scientific articles (job hazard!!). I still occasionally read books, but only a few chapters, and got bored quickly.</p> <p>I don\u2019t really like sci-fi (even the movies). I want to start with something light and work my way up. Any suggestions?

When I researched it I discovered that there where major differences between translated editions and that the one by Kuniczak was the best, so that&#39;s the one I got. I still plan to get both the &quot;The Deluge &quot; and &quot;Fire in the Steppes&quot; to finish out the trilogy. What I love about it is both the classical heroes journey and immersion into eastern European culture and time period.</p> <p>With that in mind I plan to get both &quot; Canterbury tales &quot; by Chauser and &quot; Tirant lo Blanch by Joanot Martorell. So my question is, do I need to be aware what edition to get with these as well, and can you recommend books like the trilogy by Sienkiewicz and &quot;The Conqueror&quot; series by Conn Iggulden?</p> <p>Thank you for your help and time</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.",
