The conference ended in overtime on November 24 with only modest climate finance goals, failed to deliver on an expected announcement of a new commitment to cut greenhouse gas emissions, and displayed unusually high tensions among nations, spurred in part by statements from the host, Azerbaijani\u00a0President Ilham Aliyev, that oil and gas was a \u201cgift from God.\u201d The result was deep concern among climate policy activists for the future of climate diplomacy.",
