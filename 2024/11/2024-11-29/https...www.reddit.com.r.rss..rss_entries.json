However, only one of them works properly in my RSS reader, while the others remain completely empty, even after several days.</p> <p>Strangely, when I click &quot;Edit&quot; on the alert in Google Alerts, I can see plenty of results in the preview section at the bottom. This suggests the alerts are working, but the RSS feeds aren\u2019t pulling the data.</p> <p>Is this a known issue with Google Alerts? Are there any limitations or specific bugs related to its RSS feed functionality?</p> <p>Thanks in advance for your help!</p> <p>Screenshoots: </p> <p><a href=\"https://ibb.co/n82nv9B\">https://ibb.co/n82nv9B</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://ibb.co/fxVsNSr\">https://ibb.co/fxVsNSr</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Cool_Reflection_1093\"> /u/Cool_Reflection_1093 </a> <br/> <spa",
