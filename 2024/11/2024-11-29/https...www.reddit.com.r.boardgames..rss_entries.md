I think the marbles had a plastic ring around them. There may have been elastics at the bottom of the U shape to help with deflection. I think there was a little sliding score keeper on the side.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi yall! I’m looking for a board game that me and my girlfriend played on our first date. The game consists of large cardboard monsters, cards with our chosen “class” (tailor, butcher are two examples but I can’t remember the rest), and dice. The dice have sides composed of strengths wisdom, strength, and one other attribute, and I believe each class has their on dice. The dice vary based on the classes strength and have singles or doubles of the wisdom, strength, etc on them. The monsters you flip have points composed of each strength on the dice, that once rolled in successive turns, kill the monster! You flip through monsters until you reach a boss- which there are three of that you pick between! </p> <p>The art style of the game is very dark, scary medieval graphics.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So my wife and I decided to start playing board games instead of streaming TV and scrolling on the phones. I had a good thread last week asking for different games to play. Now I need your help to make sure I have a good variety of &quot;game types&quot;. What would you add as a gateway game to round out the &quot;types&quot; of games that I own? I want to make sure I am not owning too many tile games as an example or maybe I am completely missing a &quot;type&quot; of game. I don&#39;t know all the game types that are out there.</p> <p>Here is what I bought so far:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Azul</strong> - We are loving this one!</li> <li><strong>Cascadia</strong> - Definitely has been enjoyable!</li> <li><strong>Carcassonne</strong> - Was quick &amp; easy to start playing</li> <li><strong>Everdell</strong> - Have not played yet</li> <li><strong>New York Zoo</strong> - Have not played yet just ordered from Barnes&amp; Noble today was on sale for $19.99</

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Just yesterday, I received my copy of Thunder Road: Vendetta - Maximum Chrome with the Carnival of Chaos expansion. My intent was to play this game primarily at the 4p count that BGG recommends. I was thinking of taking it for a spin at 2p with just my wife to get the rules down. My concern, however, is that the design might be too antagonistic at 2p for her to enjoy and she’ll be less inclined to try it with our couple friends at 4p. The 2p games we play have some interaction but often not direct conflict. I think in a group setting she would have fun with it (and I think they’d all enjoy beating up on me in TR:V), so I’m wondering if others feel like playing 2p might turn someone off from trying it at 4.</p> <p>As an aside, which modules do people start playing with on their first time? I was thinking of just adding the extra damage and hazards and then just explaining them as they come up rather than doing a detailed explanation of every one at th

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have an engine in Wyrmspan netting me at least 3 guild points every turn, which lead to me using all of my player markers. This means that I can&#39;t claim my first place position on the objective board. </p> <p>Does the player that would have gotten second place bump up to first because I can&#39;t claim it? Or is first place wasted?</p> <p>Need answer quickly we&#39;re in the fourth round.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/IamTrashuo"> /u/IamTrashuo </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1h2bbr0/odd_wyrmspan_situation_rule_help_needed/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1h2bbr0/odd_wyrmspan_situation_rule_help_needed/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve visited Uchi&#39;s website but I dont see a language choice on his products.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>A while ago I went to a boardgame café and ended up playing a card game. To simply put it, the cards make the rules.</p> <p>The box is weirdly bigger than the card size, and I&#39;d say the cards are all white with black text.</p> <p>A number of cards are dealt and one card is played at a time. The rules can be as weird as &quot;if any of you say they/them, they loose&quot; or &quot;play rock paper scissors with another player; if they play rock you loose&quot;.</p> <p>I have the vague idea that the title of this game is rather long.</p> <p>It&#39;s not Fluxx nor Red7, as google suggested.</p> <p>I contacted the boardgame café but didn&#39;t get a reply and I don&#39;t live that close to it to be easy to go back there.</p> <p>Thank you in advance.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/evil_pea"> /u/evil_pea </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1h29o81/help_me_find_out_
