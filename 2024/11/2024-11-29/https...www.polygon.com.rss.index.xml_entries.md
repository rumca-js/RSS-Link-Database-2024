<p class="has-text-align-none">Using the <strong>knife</strong> in <em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/black-ops-6-guides">Black Ops 6</a></em> is a little trickier than other Call of Duty titles. You’ll often see other players running around with their knives, baseball bats, or even power drills, but when you try to melee it only bashes other players with the butt of your gun. Better yet, the melee doesn’t eliminate other players in one hit.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap has-text-align-none">The Game Awards is celebrating its 10th anniversary this year. But for a full decade before The Game Awards, there was another, rowdier game-honoring awards show produced by Geoff Keighley: the Spike TV Video Game Awards. Just like the modern-day Game Awards, Spike’s show aired live, but it was on an actual television channel, without a Twitch chat to accompany it. It had skits. It had a celebrity host; in 2004, that was Snoop Dogg. And today it is a high-octane time capsule into how video games were classically marketed side
