<p>If you want to upgrade your PC’s performance with a face-melting SSD, then don’t miss this spectacular deal for Samsung’s 990 Pro SSD. It’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Internal-Expansion-MZ-V9P2T0B-AM/dp/B0BHJJ9Y77/">dropped down to just $160 on Amazon</a> for Black Friday. That’s a stunning 36 percent discount off its original $250 price — a very noteworthy drop for this specific SSD.</p>



<p>When we <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1344995/samsung-990-pro-nvme-ssd-review.html">reviewed the Samsung 990 Pro</a>, our only complaint was its price tag. That’s obviously no longer an issue with this mammoth price drop. In our review, we praised the Samsung 990 Pro’s performance and the fact that it’s available with and without a heat sink. (The heat sink model is also on sale, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Internal-Expansion-MZ-

<p>Damn, it’s hard to stop myself from buying some of these OLED gaming monitors on sale for Black Friday. I’m trying to hold out for another year, but it’s not easy with bigger and bigger discounts coming in. Take this 49-inch MSI OLED ultrawide, for example: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/MSI-MPG-491CQP-QD-OLED-response/dp/B0CTRXCNV8/">it’s just $799.99 on Amazon</a>, a solid THOUSAND BUCKS less than some other 49-inch OLEDs.</p>



<p>The MPG 491CQP is a dual-QHD design, probably using the same 49-inch, 5120×1440 panel as <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2374348/49-inch-oled-gaming-monitor-hits-a-new-low-at-900.html">Gigabyte’s alternative</a>. At 144Hz refresh and .03ms response, it’s a little less zippy than some similar OLED monitors, but if you’re pushing that much resolution I doubt you’ll be maxing out its framerate on any 3D game released

<p>One of the key benefits of a laptop is its everyday practicality. For road warriors, a laptop lets you take on the world wherever you are; for others, tethering your laptop to your desktop can be a great way to enhance your productivity or even your gaming experience.</p>



<p>But what if you mainly use your laptop at home, it’s pretty much <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2341922/how-to-use-an-external-monitor-with-a-gaming-laptop.html">always connected to an external monitor</a>, and you don’t really need the laptop screen? In that case, running your laptop in clamshell mode (i.e., with the screen closed) is a fantastic option. You’ll get to enjoy the larger display of a monitor <em>and</em> have better ergonomics to boot — plus your laptop will draw much less power with the screen turned off.</p>
