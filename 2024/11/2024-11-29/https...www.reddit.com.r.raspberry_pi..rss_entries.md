<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Long story short, I would like opinions on how well and how fast a Rasperry PI works as a NAS.<br/> More details below.</p> <p>So, I am thinking about setting up a NAS for my house.<br/> I currently just have several HDs in my main PC,<br/> One 3TB HD for my family photos and vids, that is mirrored to another 3TB HD as backup.<br/> Then another 4TB HD for movies that I use Plex to play. That is not backed up.</p> <p>I am running out of space, especially for the movies, plus I would like them to have SOME sort of redundancy.<br/> My original plan was to swap out the movie drive to a 8TB one, and get a second 8TB HD to mirror it to.<br/> BUT, I dont like the very very mixed reviews I see on any cost effective 8TB drive, they just dont seem to be as reliable unless you spend big $ on them.</p> <p>SO, this got me to looking into NAS.<br/> I had one YEARS ago, and it left a bad taste in my mouth.<br/> It had a crappy interface mainly and wasnt pleasant to

I haven&#39;t had this issue running any other OS on the device. </p> <p>Searches I&#39;ve found so far only suggest a faulty device, but it can&#39;t be that due to multiple OSes not having this issue. </p> <p>Eth0 occurs constantly and persistently, connected through PoE and a switch, again, this did not affect it with any other OS installed. </p> <p>Wifi is intermittent but no other device connected to wifi is experiencing this issue at the same time, so I believe I can rule out my router. </p> <p>Any suggestions?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Romanus122"> /u/Romanus122 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1h2kzsl/pi4b4gb_packet_loss_with_raspberry_pi_os_20241119/"
