<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Preferably high fantasy. I really love the Genre but i&#39;m having bad luck with my picks recently.</p> <p>As far as my taste: Ofcourse LoTR is the goat. I don&#39;t like Brandon Sanderson (so i won&#39;t be finishing wheel of time) I hated Jade city John Gwynne is ok (I&#39;ve read the first book of faithful and fallen series and it was like 6.5-7/10. ) Joe Abercrombie is ok. First law was fine. (Not the best thing i&#39;ve ever read, and certainly not worth all the hype, but it was good) And I really like Robin Hobbs prose and story telling. Black leopard, red wolf was a great read as well, but i haven&#39;t heard many good things about the second book.</p> <p>Everytime i&#39;ve took a suggestion from booktok or booktube i&#39;ve been extremely disappointed. Looking for new suggestions or maybe lesser known books, those hidden gems you&#39;ve found and really liked. Thank you!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.

That was one of the most eye opening books I’ve ever read to this day and started my journey of reading more “adult” books.

I read a lot of scientific articles (job hazard!!). I still occasionally read books, but only a few chapters, and got bored quickly.</p> <p>I don’t really like sci-fi (even the movies).

I still plan to get both the &quot;The Deluge &quot; and &quot;Fire in the Steppes&quot; to finish out the trilogy. What I love about it is both the classical heroes journey and immersion into eastern European culture and time period.</p> <p>With that in mind I plan to get both &quot; Canterbury tales &quot; by Chauser and &quot; Tirant lo Blanch by Joanot Martorell. So my question is, do I need to be aware what edition to get with these as well, and can you recommend books like the trilogy by Sienkiewicz and &quot;The Conqueror&quot; series by Conn Iggulden?</p> <p>Thank you for your help and time</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.

I have Libby so was thinking of turning on an audiobook. </p> <p>Neither of us like romance or books where not much is happening. We both like comedy. </p> <p>He doesn&#39;t like nonfiction. As he puts it, he likes sci-fi, space, monsters, fantasy, action. He&#39;s a Star wars (I don&#39;t mind sci-fi and space, just don&#39;t like this franchise tbh), Marvel, video game nerd. But not in a way that I think Ready Player One would be a good fit of that makes sense. Rather a more fantasy/Sci-fi story that would make a good video game setting. </p> <p>I read almost anything. I prefer intense twists, and I like horror. I like kooky books like Queenie Malone&#39;s Paradise Hotel and weird books like Geek Love. I also looove historical fiction like Road to Wellville. </p> <p>Another note: I have auditory problems including having issues understanding accents (including British) So id prefer no heavy accen

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey all, looking to get my grandfather a couple of books for Christmas! I would love if they could be maybe ones we could book club together? My grandma has recently passed and I would love to get him back into an old hobby! He’s into westerns but also loved the Harry Potter series, I like historical fiction. I love Kate Quinn and Kristin Hannah but their books are usually female perspectives and may not be his jam. I also don’t know all that’s he’s read but I know he hasn’t read anything recently so the newer, the safer bet he hasn’t read it before! Having never read a western myself I don’t know where to start! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/rangerrick307"> /u/rangerrick307 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1h2bo0g/recommendations_for_grandpa/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1h2bo0g/recommendat
