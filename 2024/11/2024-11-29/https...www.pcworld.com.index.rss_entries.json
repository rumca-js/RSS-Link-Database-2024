It\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Internal-Expansion-MZ-V9P2T0B-AM/dp/B0BHJJ9Y77/\">dropped down to just $160 on Amazon</a> for Black Friday. That\u2019s a stunning 36 percent discount off its original $250 price \u2014 a very noteworthy drop for this specific SSD.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When we <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1344995/samsung-990-pro-nvme-ssd-review.html\">reviewed the Samsung 990 Pro</a>, our only complaint was its price tag. That\u2019s obviously no longer an issue with this mammoth price drop. In our review, we praised the Samsung 990 Pro\u2019s performance and the fact that it\u2019s available with and without a heat sink. (The heat sink model is also on sale, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Internal-Expansion-MZ-",

I\u2019m trying to hold out for another year, but it\u2019s not easy with bigger and bigger discounts coming in. Take this 49-inch MSI OLED ultrawide, for example: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/MSI-MPG-491CQP-QD-OLED-response/dp/B0CTRXCNV8/\">it\u2019s just $799.99 on Amazon</a>, a solid THOUSAND BUCKS less than some other 49-inch OLEDs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The MPG 491CQP is a dual-QHD design, probably using the same 49-inch, 5120\u00d71440 panel as <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/2374348/49-inch-oled-gaming-monitor-hits-a-new-low-at-900.html\">Gigabyte\u2019s alternative</a>. At 144Hz refresh and .03ms response, it\u2019s a little less zippy than some similar OLED monitors, but if you\u2019re pushing that much resolution I doubt you\u2019ll be maxing out its framerate on any 3D game released ",

For road warriors, a laptop lets you take on the world wherever you are; for others, tethering your laptop to your desktop can be a great way to enhance your productivity or even your gaming experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what if you mainly use your laptop at home, it\u2019s pretty much <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/2341922/how-to-use-an-external-monitor-with-a-gaming-laptop.html\">always connected to an external monitor</a>, and you don\u2019t really need the laptop screen? In that case, running your laptop in clamshell mode (i.e., with the screen closed) is a fantastic option. You\u2019ll get to enjoy the larger display of a monitor <em>and</em> have better ergonomics to boot \u2014 plus your laptop will draw much less power with the screen turned off.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreI",
