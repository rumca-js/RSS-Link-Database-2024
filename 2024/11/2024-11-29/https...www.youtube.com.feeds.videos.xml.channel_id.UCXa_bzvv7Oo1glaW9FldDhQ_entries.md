Despite some praise from critics and players, GSC Game World's S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl has its fair share of problems. However, one of the more notable bugs is those affecting A-Life 2.0. Though built up as an evolution of a beloved feature from previous titles, its impact has been negligible since its launch.

The extent is pretty significant, whether it's the limited radius by which players witness the persistent AI or its complete lack of running in the background. The development team has confirmed that it isn't working as intended and that fixes are on the way, but those will take some time and multiple updates.

There's something about buggy releases or major games with core features missing, but it's an even stickier subject with S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2. Join us as we discuss A-Life, the sequel's supposed improvements, and where things may have gone wrong.
