I remember her playing various Mario games and Ronald McDonald treasure adventure. </p> <p>My mother liked a slightly newer generation and bonded with N64 games like Banjo-Kazooie/Tooie in addition to sega genesis games like the Adams family and the lion king. </p> <p>I don&#39;t live close to either of them but I will be visiting for the holidays. So recommendations I&#39;d be looking for is something that wouldn&#39;t confuse someone who isn&#39;t particularly tech savvy (though grandma is getting better and has figured out how to get new apps on her iPad over the last year). </p> <p>I&#39;ve done a bit of looking and I can&#39;t find very reliable info on which systems out there carry which games.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m wondering if my luck is simply bad, as someone who has been to retro game stores in New Hampshire and Florida, I always have rude owners. I understand a business should concern themselves over making money, if you&#39;re driving customers away with your attitude you will not get far. I honestly hate eBay, but I&#39;d rather buy online than go through the hassle of paying eBay prices at local stores. I hope this retro bubble burst at some point, there will come a time when necessities are going to be more expensive and video games will take a back seat.</p> <p>Whenever I walk in and see a copy of Banjo Tooie for $600, I walk out. I&#39;m not paying you a whole paycheck for a game made before 9/11. </p> <p>I emulate many retro games, but I do enjoy the authentic hardware and love to do a bit of both. Anything prior to the PS2 era is out of reach for most people.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/u

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I finally pulled the trigger on Double Dragon NES and yeah, it is harder than what I&#39;d like to play. I&#39;m playing via emulation so I used save states and actually beat it. If you haven&#39;t played this game, Well let me tell you what makes it unique. It is a beat &#39;em up game (actually a port of an arcade game) where you don&#39;t have all your attacks/moves at the start of the game. You have to earn points to unlock attacks.</p> <p>I didn&#39;t like this game a lot back then, even though I liked other Double Dragon games, due to its difficulty. It is not &quot;Nintendo hard&quot; but again, it&#39;s harder than what I&#39;m willing to put up with nowadays. The hit stun that enemies have is waaay to short (they can counter-attack as you&#39;re attacking them) and the game doesn&#39;t give you any continues or the ability to earn extra lives. It is also annoying how enemies can easily dodge the powerful attacks that you learn along the way
