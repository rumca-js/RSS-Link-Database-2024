The year is 1894 and the world is extremely different from ours. Crashed alien technology, ancient gods and a revolution in technology has the world at war over resources and the future of great nations. Armoured Clash is Warcradle Studios Dystopian Age 10mm Mass Combat Game out this month from Warcradle. The Boxed Set contains armies for The Crown and Empire along with dice, terrain and rulebooks. Bob and I have painted up the two forces and are running through the Quick Start rules provided in the box. This second game is Mission 5 in the Quickstart booklet as we incorporate Transports and more units into our game.
