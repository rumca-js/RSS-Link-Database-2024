I was originally planning to grab either the Trimui Smart Pro or the Anbernic RG40XXH for some retro gaming. Like, I\u2019ve been itching to relive my 90s and early 2000s childhood vibes. But now I\u2019m kinda rethinking everything.</p> <p>I was looking around and thought, why not just get a decent Android phone with a Snapdragon mid-to-high range chip instead? I could throw RetroArch on there and pair it with a Bluetooth gamepad (or maybe one of those fancy Type-C controllers). Feels like it could be a lot more versatile, you know?</p> <p>But, like, is this even a good idea? My brain\u2019s telling me the phone would probably have more power than those handhelds, and I wouldn\u2019t have to juggle multiple devices. Plus, it\u2019d double as an actual phone (duh). But then I think about the handheld form factor and how it\u2019s just\u2026 right. And I wonder if I\u2019d lose some of the nostalgia vibes with an Android setup.</p> <p>Anyone here done something ",

I&#39;m playing via emulation so I used save states and actually beat it. If you haven&#39;t played this game, Well let me tell you what makes it unique. It is a beat &#39;em up game (actually a port of an arcade game) where you don&#39;t have all your attacks/moves at the start of the game. You have to earn points to unlock attacks.</p> <p>I didn&#39;t like this game a lot back then, even though I liked other Double Dragon games, due to its difficulty. It is not &quot;Nintendo hard&quot; but again, it&#39;s harder than what I&#39;m willing to put up with nowadays. The hit stun that enemies have is waaay to short (they can counter-attack as you&#39;re attacking them) and the game doesn&#39;t give you any continues or the ability to earn extra lives. It is also annoying how enemies can easily dodge the powerful attacks that you learn along the way ",

While I can play most games on any of these systems, I know some versions or platforms might offer a better experience than others.</p> <p>What I&#39;d love to know is:</p> <ol> <li>What retro games do you consider absolute must-plays?</li> <li>For each game you recommend, where do you prefer to play it - handheld for comfort (like playing in bed), or does it really deserve the full CRT TV experience? Looking to balance convenience with the best way to experience these classics.</li> </ol> <p>Looking forward to reading your suggestions :) Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; ",
