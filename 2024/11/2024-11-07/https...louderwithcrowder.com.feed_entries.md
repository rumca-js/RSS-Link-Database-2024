Elections can easily go either way, and emotions run high after a loss. There are people in my real life who I love who voted differently than me and who aren't nursing a celebratory hangover right now. Unfortunately, many of them fell victim to misinformation, whether about Project 2025, fascism, or things they were told Trump said that he didn't really say. I'll allow them time to grieve in peace.</p><p>But that's only people I know IRL. People like Jimmy Kimmel can choke on a bag of dicks. Because my dude...

And no matter how much the left demands you disbelieve your eyes in the name of inclusion, do not acquiesce to their demands of affirming at the expense of women’s safety and sports. Because it turns out that the un-woke mob was correct all along, and the “woman” who beat up real women at the Olympics actually has “testicles” and XY chromosomes.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Remember the man who won an Olympic gold medal in women’s boxing?<br/><br/>His medical reports show he has XY chromosomes, male testosterone levels, testicles, & a micropenis.<br/><br/>But that never mattered—they believe that words & feelings make you woman, not biology.<a href="https://t.co/Ip8KLvEt6S">https://t.co/

It is time to point fingers as to who is to blame. For many on the Left, the blame is on sexist Black men and Latino men who are both sexist AND racist. There is some blame going Joe Biden's way for even running for reelection in the first place. Then you have the shrill harpies from The View. They've identified a unique scapegoat.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">What's really important right now is for the Left and the media (but I repeat myself) to avoid taking a look in the mirror and instead just act insultingly toward black and Latino men.<br/>— Brodigan (@brodigan) <a href="https://twitter.com/brodigan/status/1854485613304
