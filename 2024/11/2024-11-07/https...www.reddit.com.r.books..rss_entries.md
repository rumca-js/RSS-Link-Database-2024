<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’ve thought I’d ask what the general sentiment is, no matter if reasonable or not to feel this way. I’m not from the US but I read a lot of intersectional feminist essays that come from the US and a lot of the books I have in my amazon list have suddenly either gone out of stock or have a notification that not many books are left to buy. I was waiting for a book about disability justice and feminism I had pre ordered for months and suddenly it told me no delivery before may 2025 when it was supposed to finally go out for delivery today. It makes me wonder if there’s a panic reaction en masse or something. I myself feel quite worried about this when you know what happened in the past with these types of books and how much knowledge has been lost because of it. But yeah anyway, just wondering if I’m imagining a phenomenon based on what I saw on amazon or if people indeed have felt the urge to buy these types of books immediately « just in case ». </p>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Sometimes, I&#39;ll be reading a novel, enjoying the narrative, and then the author will go off on a massive digression that is not entirely necessary to the book, where they just want to show me how much they learned while doing research for their character. I don&#39;t get mad about this. I usually find it endearing, and if they overdue it, I can just skim.</p> <p>An example of this would be Ian McEwan&#39;s <em>Saturday</em>. The main character is a neurosurgeon. There are so many digressions in that book where McEwan is aggressively showing the reader how much he learned about the brain. Sometimes, it adds something important to the narrative or deepens the character. At other times, McEwan is just crowbarring in some interesting detail he learned.</p> <p>This isn&#39;t a complaint or anything. It&#39;s just a kind of a sweet little thing I love about reading.
