<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Any novels or books series that hit some of the same beats as the best Spiderman stories? For specifics, what I tend to like in Spiderman <strong>(and most well written superhero stories)</strong> are:</p> <p>A young man forced into adulthood and struggling while trying his best.</p> <p>A character forced to keep secrets that alienate him from people close to him.</p> <p>A wide cast of conflicting personalities. School crushes, bullies, and friends turned enemies along with eccentric co-workers, difficult family and dangerous strangers.</p> <p>High concept ideas in normal settings that showcase the reaction to this happening.</p> <p>Mixture of different story types. Spiderman stories have elements of coming of age, fantasy, crime, sci-fi, slice of life, romcom&#39;s, and drama so anything that hits most of that would be ideal.</p> <p>I would like to stress the story doesn&#39;t have to be superhero related <strong>(although that&#39;d still be cool)<

Even better if this person is some kind of nerdy/bookish type who everybody thinks shouldn’t get mixed up with crime, and that, if they find themselves in a dangerous situation, can rely only on their brains or external intervention, and not on any kind of combat training. Possibly something not extremely violent, just a relaxing book to spend an afternoon or two. I haven’t read many mystery novels, but recently I came across a couple of Jacquot Grunewald novels where the protagonist is like that and I absolutely loved the idea. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/jixyl"> /u/jixyl </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1gm3fcm/mystery_novels_where_a_normal_person_is_the/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1gm

Her lips, painted a daring shade of scarlet, curled into a smile that could either be a prelude to trouble or the promise of a grand idea. She wore an oversized leather jacket, frayed at the sleeves, the kind of garment that whispered tales of late-night escapades and impromptu road trips.

So he knew a lot of stuff that was going to happen, because he played it. He used it to find important items, meet strong people, earn their favor and learn from them to gain strength. He wasn&#39;t saving the world or playing hero, but did everything according to benefits which he could gain for himself. He was someone who fit the high-functioning sociopath description.</p> <p>I would like some books with someone similar, who has power/strength/ability but uses this for himself and not for others.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi! I&#39;ve been reading book related to my interest and career.They are vast amount of books I had aligning with my so much interest that I couldn&#39;t even manage either.I&#39;m reading books consistently with psychology and programming but I fall behind the other books that I should have read(Math, Biography, Science and Philosophy) It&#39;s alot but I still want to keep most of it as most of them are necessary not only for my interest but also for my career.Once I try to read, it feels just like my mind has an audiobook built in,making my self listen to it,but not actually absorbing the information I had to take.Any advice, thoughts, tips about this?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/LostUser1121"> /u/LostUser1121 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1glpngz/absorbing_information_from_books/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Ok, so I like books with hunger-game style books. I&#39;ve so far enjoyed Divergent series, Hunger Games, Red Rising series. I also really want some books close to Sarah J Maas books. Her book concepts are fine but I feel like the execution is so bad. It&#39;s sometimes so cringey that I end up dropping them. </p> <p>Any recommendations?
