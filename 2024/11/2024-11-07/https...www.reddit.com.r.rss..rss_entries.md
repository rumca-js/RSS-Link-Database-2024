<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello. </p> <p>So to be brief, I would like to collect multiple RSS feeds (some 20-ish, but more might be collected) into one feed to be read by a single source, which is a Discord bot to be read on a channel for easy notifications for its readers.</p> <p>I&#39;m looking at free sources here and I found RSS Mixer and Feed Informer. So I tried the latter because it allows for 50 feeds for a free user which is great but I&#39;m still looking at other options.</p> <p>What experiences do you have with services like this? Can you tell me which ones output best in feeds and how efficient they are and etc?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/PhantomLordG"> /u/PhantomLordG </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1glm9as/what_are_comparisons_and_experiences_youve_had/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1glm9as/what_are_comparisons_and_experien
