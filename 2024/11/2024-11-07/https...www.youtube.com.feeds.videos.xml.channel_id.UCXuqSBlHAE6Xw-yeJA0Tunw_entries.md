Thanks again to REDMAGIC for sponsoring this video! Go to https://lmg.gg/duOgg to check out their TITAN 16 PRO gaming laptop today!

Brands love to say their electronics are “turbo charged”, but the turbo button, Intel turbo boost, and the Taycan Turbo S all share one thing… no turbo! Well today we’re changing that by attaching a 6.7hp electric turbo to a laptop.
