Specifically, he said Switch software will be compatible, but this likely also means physical cartridges will also work on the new console. In other news, Blizzard could be working on a remaster for WarCraft 2: Tides of Darkness. The game originally hit PC way back in 1995, and could definitely use a fresh coat of paint. The info comes from an internal update at Blizzard, which featured some art and an update that the project has at least hit the alpha stage. And finally, back to Nintendo, the company gave a vague update about the release window for The Legend of Zelda live-action movie.\n\n#IGN #Gaming #Nintendo", "id": 1468052, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK7D4dL1m_M", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 149, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/EK7D4dL1m_M/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Nintendo Confirms Major Switch 2 Feature - IGN Daily Fix", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-11-07T00:17:07+00:00", "description": null, "id": 1468053, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW9JdVMNrdM", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 26, "page_rating_contents": 82, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 149, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/iW9JdVMNrdM/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "The perfect gift for a Stranger Things fan, now at IGN Store for $39.99! #netflix #strangerthings", "vote": 0}]
