Taking place on the first day of the alien invasion, this morphs from a muted, pessimistic mediation on what it means to live with terminal illness to a loud, high-energy action horror, to a life-affirming commentary on friendship and community. This is not what people were expecting from the franchise, and I can see why so many people were disappointed as result. However, taken on its own terms, this is an interesting character study, a deep, thoughtful look at what it means to live, especially when it\u2019s all going to be taken away anyway (as it will be for us all, even without a cancer diagnosis), and is well worth watching for that alone. Still, unless you are a particularly loud person for whom the idea of being quiet long term produces a deep, existential dread, A Quiet Place: Day One is not going to be a film", "id": 1468722, "language": "en-AU", "link": "https://www.grimdarkmagazine.com/review-a-quiet-place-day-one", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 137, "source_url": "https://www.grimdarkmagazine.com/feed", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "REVIEW: A Quiet Place: Day One", "vote": 0}]
