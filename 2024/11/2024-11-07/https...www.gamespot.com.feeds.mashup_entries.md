<p>Activision has announced what's coming to Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 in its upcoming Season 1 update, and there are multiple new melee weapons on the way, including a power drill.</p><p>The two-hit-kill melee weapon is effective at very short range and has a fast attack speed, Activision said. The melee weapon has multiple attack vectors, including sweeps, jabs, uppercuts, and a heavy attack when pressed straight on. "This weapon is ideal for putting a hole in the competition when the going gets tough," Activision said.</p><p>The power drill can be unlocked via en event reward sometime during Season 1, but Activision didn't reveal exactly how it can be unlocked. In any event, the drill itself has 30 levels and mastery badges available, and it can be customized with unique skins. Death by power drill sounds particularly gruesome, but no footage of the drill in action has been released thus far.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-6-lets-you-become-a-gruesome-kill

<p>Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick has spoken about the importance in creating new franchises, or "new IP," in the industry parlance. During <a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/11/06/take-two-interactive-software-ttwo-q2-2025-earning/">Take-Two's latest earnings briefing</a>, Zelnick said nothing remains popular forever, so it's an essential business condition to always make new things instead of relying on sequels.</p><p>"We're different than a lot of other big companies. It's tempting for a big company to rest on its laurels," he said.</p><p>Take-Two would know a thing or two about having big franchises, as the company owns the Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead franchises, both of which are enormously successful. Take-Two has referred to GTA and Red Dead as "permanent" franchises, meaning the company will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/another-reason-to-believe-red-dead-redemption-2-is-happening/1100-6419966/">never stop making sequels.</a></p><a href

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/">Grand Theft Auto VI</a> is in development for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, but how will the game look and perform on the relatively less-powerful Series S? We don't know for sure, but Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick is not losing sleep over it.</p><p>During <a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/11/06/take-two-interactive-software-ttwo-q2-2025-earning/">Take-Two's latest earnings call</a>, Zelnick was asked about the Series S being, by design, a lower-spec console compared to Series X and PS5. GTA VI is expected to be a boundary-pushing game technically speaking, prompting concerns by some that it won't be a great experience on the console.</p><p>"Look, we support the platforms where the consumers are for as long as they're there, and we find a way to support platforms despite different levels of tech. Our labels are really good at that. I'm not really worried,

<p dir="ltr">There's no sugarcoating the Borderlands movie's success--specifically the lack thereof--at the box office this year. Even Take-Two Interactive CEO Strauss Zelnick knows the "film was disappointing," but there is a silver lining: The action flick led to an uptick in Borderlands video game sales.</p><p dir="ltr">During a company earnings call, Zelnick touched on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-movie-has-earned-a-shockingly-low-amount-after-first-month/1100-6526440/">the Borderlands movie, which earned a shockingly low amount of money after a month</a> in theaters. "Even though the film was disappointing, it actually benefited our catalog sales. So that is a sign that making a movie or a television show based on our very high-quality IP can drive catalog sales, and that can be a good thing," said Zelnick.</p><div data-embed-type="video" data-ref-id="2300-6464795" data-src="/videos/which-borderlands-game-should-you-play-first/2300-6464795/" data-width=

However Warzone Mobile is already going to be losing support on older mobile devices starting later this month.</p><p>On November 14, Warzone Mobile's minimum specs will require iOS 17 or Android 13 or higher, as well as a GPU capable of bindless texturing. After that date, devices that can't meet those requirements will no longer receive updates or get access to the game's latest Season 1 content.</p><p>Users with older devices will still be able to play Warzone Mobile as long as version 3.10 has been downloaded and installed ahead of November 14. Unfortunately, this is a temporary reprieve. Activision's grace period will only extend six months before the revised minimum specs will be enforced for players who are still on t
