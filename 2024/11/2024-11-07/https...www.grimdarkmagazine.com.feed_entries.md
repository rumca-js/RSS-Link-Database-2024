<p>Third in the series and acting as a kind of prequel, A Quiet Place: Day One, directed by Michael Sarnoski, offers something thematically different to the previous films. Taking place on the first day of the alien invasion, this morphs from a muted, pessimistic mediation on what it means to live with terminal illness to a loud, high-energy action horror, to a life-affirming commentary on friendship and community. This is not what people were expecting from the franchise, and I can see why so many people were disappointed as result. However, taken on its own terms, this is an interesting character study, a deep, thoughtful look at what it means to live, especially when itâ€™s all going to be taken away anyway (as it will be for us all, even without a cancer diagnosis), and is well worth watching for that alone. Still, unless you are a particularly loud person for whom the idea of being quiet long term produces a deep, existential dread, A Quiet Place: Day One is not going to be a film
