<p>We’re in a new age of AI now. Google has an AI video maker available on select Workspace editions.</p>

<p>Voice assistants have a reputation for finicky activation, such as responding to their prompts that are spoken in an ad. Apple may have a fix for that in the works. <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/11/07/apple-tv-ads-hey-siri/" data-original-link="https://9to5mac.com/2024/11/07/apple-tv-ads-hey-siri/"><em>9to5Mac</em></a> spotted this element in the tvOS 18.2 beta. A part of code called AdBlocker appears to use the Shazam API to match audio captured by a device's microphones against audio fingerprints downloaded from Apple. When there's a match, the usual Siri trigger command is disabled. In theory, this means Apple could have devices not react to the "Hey Siri" prompt when it's spoken as part of the company's keynote presentations or TV advertisements.</p>

<p>Apple's excellent MacBook Pros are faster than ever with its new M4 chips. That's it, that's the review. Their screens are slightly brighter, and the 14-inch model now starts with 16GB of RAM, but otherwise these are the same laptops that have been around since the <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mac-book-pro-14-16-inch-review-2021-apple-mighty-macs-130011975-130011932.html">M1 Pro redesign in 2021</a>.

## Apple Mac mini review (M4 Pro, 2024): Shockingly small, incredibly powerful

<p>"That's a computer?!" My daughter just couldn't believe her eyes when I pulled the new Mac mini out of its box. It measures just five-inches by five-inches across, and it sits a mere two inches tall. The Mac mini is an adorable box that resembles an oversized Apple TV. But what's more impressive is that it's significantly faster than before, thanks to Apple's M4 and M4 Pro chips, and it still starts at $599. Once again, the Mac mini redefines what a desktop can be.</p> 
<p>While Apple may have started the tiny PC trend with the original Mac mini in 2005, it's certainly not alone today. Intel's NUC line survived execution and is now being spearheaded by ASUS, but those boxes are still expensive and relatively niche. <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:HP Store;elmt:;cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=8a0e8870-4cf8-4bda-935c-af7c00c28e2b&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=8e4ad91a-b239-4b0c-926b-f972cb01af5a&amp;featureId=t

<p>Blink just unveiled the Sync Module XR wireless extender, which is an update of the pre-existing Sync Module. This device is primarily intended to extend the wireless range of the <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/blinks-outdoor-4-security-camera-offers-sharper-video-day-and-night-140100728.html">company’s Outdoor 4 security camera</a>. To that end, it can increase the range by up to 400 feet, which is four times the standard Blink Sync Module.</p> 
<p>This means that users can plop the affiliated security camera pretty much wherever they want, even in the case of a large and expansive property. Blink says that “customers now have the freedom to install Outdoor 4 on their fence, gate, shed or entry of their driveway and know their cameras will stay online and connected.”</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>The latest version of Matter, the <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/matter-smart-home-standard-released-160059101.html">open smart home standard</a> that largely hasn’t yet lived up to its lofty promises for seamless device-agnostic integration, is now available.

The new version’s biggest feature may be Enhanced Multi-Admin, which aims to improve interoperability between different device ecosystems.</p>
<p>The Connectivity Standards Alliance, which manages Matter, describes version 1.4 as “a significant step forward in the Matter ecosystem.” It says the update resulted from the coalition’s hundreds of member companies (including Apple, Amazon, Google and Samsung) working with thousands of engineers and product experts.

The <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/playstation-5-pro-review-a-superpowered-700-console-for-gamers-who-wont-buy-a-pc-110056410.html">PlayStation 5 Pro</a> is the console equivalent of the iPhone Pro Max or the Kindle Signature but still cheaper than a PC gaming rig. It has a more powerful GPU, capable of offering 4K and 60 fps gaming, an AI upscaler to polish up textures, new ray tracing and a substantial 2TB SSD to store all your games. (No disc drive, however.) And, as you’ll read in our full review, the PS5’s back catalog has never looked better.</p>
<p>There are good arguments for not buying the PlayStation 5 Pro — it’s a beefed up midcycle console with base performance for $700 — but if you haven’t jumped on the PS5 bandwagon yet, it gives a solid no-compromise experience.</p>

<p>You don’t need a set of AirPods to get wireless audio from your iPhone, iPad or Mac, but Apple’s earbuds and headphones offer a lot of convenient integrations with its other products that you won’t find anywhere else. After helping popularize true wireless earbuds with its original AirPods, the company has expanded its lineup to include noise-canceling models and a set of over-ear headphones. Here’s what you need to know about AirPods in general, along with the best overall, budget and over-ear picks from Apple’s current slate of products.</p>

In the first category, the competition is really between Amazon’s Kindle devices and Rakuten’s Kobo readers. Ereaders in the latter group include entries from Onyx Boox, PocketBook and a couple of smaller companies. <br><br>Of course, any smartphone or tablet can act as an ereader, but for our purposes, we focused on devices with paper-like, E Ink screens.
