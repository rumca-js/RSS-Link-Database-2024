Colors are widely used in communication within and among animal species. For example, peacocks proudly display their vibrant tails, adorned with iridescent eyespots, to attract peahens for courtship. This is a classic example of sexual selection using color signaling. Conspicuous colors are also displayed by toxic animal species, including many venomous snakes and the brilliantly colored poison frogs of Central and South America, as a warning to potential predators.

On Sept. 26, 2024, Hurricane Helene slammed into the Gulf Coast of Florida, inducing storm surges and widespread impacts on communities in its path. At the same time, NASA's Atmospheric Waves Experiment (AWE), recorded enormous swells in the atmosphere that the hurricane produced roughly 55 miles above the ground. Such information helps us better understand how terrestrial weather can affect space weather. This is part of the research NASA does to understand how our space environment can disrupt satellites, communication signals, and other technology.

Recent elections, G20 summits, and CEO pay scandals have brought inequality to the forefront of the news. Economists often point out that decisions on, say, tax policy in this arena depend on society's—and individuals'—attitudes to inequality and fairness. But how you feel about a given inequality depends on how it affects you. Behavioral economics has traditionally examined two perspectives: stakeholders who are directly affected and spectators who view the issue impartially. While research has shown how people react to injustices they experience, studies of spectators reveal how people's principles drive their support for inequality-mitigating actions.
