On Sept. 26, 2024, Hurricane Helene slammed into the Gulf Coast of Florida, inducing storm surges and widespread impacts on communities in its path. At the same time, NASA's Atmospheric Waves Experiment, or AWE, recorded enormous swells in the atmosphere that the hurricane produced roughly 55 miles above the ground.

## DNA evidence rewrites story of people buried in Pompeii eruption

Researchers have used ancient DNA to challenge long-held interpretations of the people of Pompeii. Contrary to physical appearances, the DNA evidence revealed unexpected variations in gender and kinship, revising the story as written since 1748. The genetic data also underlined the cosmopolitan nature of the Roman Empire, showing that Pompeians were mainly descended from immigrants from the eastern Mediterranean.

## Astrophysicists use echoes of light to illuminate black holes

Researchers have developed an innovative technique to search for black hole light echoes. Their novel method, which will make it easier for the mass and the spin of black holes to be measured, represents a major step forward, since it operates independently of many of the other ways in which scientists have probed these parameters in the past.

Why is human culture -- the shared body of knowledge passed down across generations -- so much more powerful than animal cultures?

## Research shows caterpillar fungus can slow down growth of cancer cells

New research into a chemical produced by a caterpillar fungus that has shown promise as a possible cancer treatment has revealed how it interacts with genes to interrupt cell growth signals. The discovery is an important step towards developing new drugs for the treatment of the disease.

## Off-the-shelf thermoelectric generators can upgrade CO2 into chemicals: The combination could help us colonize Mars

Readily available thermoelectric generators operating under modest temperature differences can power CO2 conversion, according to a proof-of-concept study by chemists. The findings open up the intriguing possibility that the temperature differentials encountered in an array of environments -- from a typical geothermal installation on Earth to the cold, desolate surface of Mars -- could power the conversion of CO2 into a range of useful fuels and chemicals.

## Does more virtual care mean more low-value care? Study suggests no

One of the top worries about telehealth is that it will drive up the use of tests and scans that patients don't need, wasting money and resources. In fact, a new study shows, low-value care didn't rise faster at primary care practices that used telehealth the most.
