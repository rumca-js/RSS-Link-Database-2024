<p>Hey folks,<p>I’m curious – is there anything you've bought in the past few years (since 2020) that really changed something in your life? Could be anything, like a gadget, a course, a subscription, even a massage or some random item you didn't think much of at first.<p>Let’s split it up into two categories:<p>- Under $100
 - Under $1000<p>What did you get? And what was the impact? I’d love to hear the stories – big or small changes, whatever made a difference for you.<p>Thanks in advance for sharing!</p>

## QNX is now free for anything non-commercial, plus there's an RPi image

<p>Hiya folks!<p>I'm John from the Developer Relations team at QNX. I'm a loooong time lurker of this forum and excited to make my first post.<p>I just wanted to let you know that we've kicked off a new program to start opening the doors to QNX like things used to be. Many of you probably used or tinkered with (the very open) QNX back in the day. You can now easily get a free non-commercial license to use the newest QNX. We've also just released some sample apps and a ready-to-go QNX 8.0 quick start target image for Raspberry Pi. So you can get QNX and the development tools for free now to learn, experiment, and build.<p>It's been a long time in the making, so I'm really excited to get to post about this first phase of the QNX Everywhere initiative. My team and management have open ears, so please share feedback about what more we can do to open things up, be more transparent, and get you what you need to create an awesome embedded QNX project.<p>Cheers!</p>

## Ask HN: Why did consumer 3D printing take so long to be invented?

<p>"Today I saw an old paper printer, it has all the pieces for 3D printing except the plastic. Computer sends it data, it moves in 1D to print the image on paper using ink. A 3D printer is just 3 of these moving pieces from a paper printer with a melting plastic and thin pipe and software to connect it all.<p>All the pieces existed to make a working 3D printer existed even in 1970! and relatively cheaply. So why has it taken so long for [at home] 3D printing to actually become a thing?<p>Is it because of the internet somehow? Did just no one care in the 1970-2010s? Like there aren't even prototypes from 1970 from garage hobbyists for 3D printing.<p>What was wrong?!"<p>- omgsoftcats</p>

<p>Hey HN! We’re James and Brandon building Codebuff (<a href="https://codebuff.com">https://codebuff.com</a>). Codebuff is like Cursor Composer, but in your terminal: it modifies files based on your natural language requests. You can try it with `npm i -g codebuff` and start using it immediately for free. We have no login gate, and we give all accounts up to $20 worth of credits.<p>Codebuff is different because we simplified the input to one step: you type what you want done in your terminal and hit enter. Then Codebuff looks through your whole codebase and makes the edits it wants, to existing source files or new ones. It also can run your tests, the type checker, or install packages to fulfill your request.<p>Demo video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQ0NOMsu0dA" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQ0NOMsu0dA</a><p>It all started at a hackathon.

## Ask HN: How would you launch a privacy-first, Instagram-like social network?

<p>Hey HN,<p>I'm planning to launch a privacy-first social network in 2025, inspired by platforms like Instagram. Success for this platform means reaching a sustainable level of recurring revenue, without relying on an ad network.<p>One challenge I'm anticipating is attracting celebrities and influencers who are already established on Instagram and TikTok. How could I persuade them to use this platform as well? For those with experience or insights, how would you approach building and promoting such a network to reach this revenue goal?<p>Thanks for any advice or ideas!</p>

<p>Hello! I’m So Tokumaru ( <a href="https://tokumaru.work" rel="nofollow">https://tokumaru.work</a> ), high school student from Japan working on ways to leverage large language models (LLMs) for K-12 programming education. Recently, I built a project called "TutoriaLLM," a self-hosted application designed to support educators and students through a multi-modal LLM that offers guided tutorials.<p>TutoriaLLM integrates voice (voice-to-voice) and text-based AI interactions into Blockly, a block editor widely known for its use in Scratch. It enables server-side code execution and allows students to test their code directly in Minecraft (Bedrock or Education Edition) without any setup.<p>I’m actively developing this project and aim to bring it to a level ready for use in programming education by next year. I’d love to hear any feedback!<p>Documentation: <a href="https://tutoriallm.com" rel="nofollow">https://tutoriallm.com</a><p>Demo: <a href="https://demo.tutoriallm.com" rel="nofollow"
