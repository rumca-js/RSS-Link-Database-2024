<p>Impressive, chilling and just a little bit silly: this update of Frederick Forsyth’s classic about a ruthless killing machine makes for highly enjoyable, trigger-happy viewing</p><p>For the first few minutes of The Day of the Jackal, you wonder why they have bothered to pay the Oscar winner Eddie Redmayne at all. He is so well disguised as an older German man that it could be anybody buried under all those prosthetics. Yet soon enough, after much prancing around an office building – where he shoots anyone who gets in the way&nbsp;– we are finally treated to the unboxing of Redmayne, as he peels away the mask, the wig, the makeup and the contact lenses. The scene is impressive, chilling and just a little bit silly – a neat summary of how the drama itself will unfold.</p><p>This is an update of Frederick Forsyth’s 1971 novel, thrust into the modern world of international politics, espionage, the dark web and criminal underworlds. Redmayne is the Jackal, a shapeshifting assassin so c

<p>A Kamala-Harris-like fate could await Keir Starmer unless he becomes more class conscious – even populist</p><p>Whatever determinedly positive things centre-left leaders around the world have said about Donald Trump’s victory in public, in private they must have greeted it with a shudder. Not just because of the dark and chaotic prospect of another Trump presidency, but because in many ways the defeated Kamala Harris is just like them. She is a hard worker, a patient reformer, a reasonably good communicator, an instinctive mover towards the ideological centre, a supposed antidote to rightwing populism, and yet also an incumbent, in an era when such perceived protectors of the status quo are widely despised.</p><p>Keir Starmer may have particular cause to worry. On her campaign website, Harris promised to “bring together” trade unions and business, “grow the economy” and increase both basic pay rates and employment.

 Why, thank you! I learned from the best playing opposite Mike Myers, whom I adored.

But it isn’t a wig as she’s a perfectly ordinary old lady.

An enthusiast, voluble, on fire with the possibilities in the ideas and ideologies he wrestled with. Every time we met – from New Haven in the early 00s to London a few years before his death in 2020 – he was essentially the same: beaming, rumpled, with a restless energy that seemed to echo the constant motion of his mind, words tumbling out as though they were, in their unstoppable abundance, overflowing. But he was also much respected in activist circles for being a good listener, and his radical egalitarianism was borne out in how he related to the people around him.</p><p>He was always an anthropologist. After doing fieldwork among traditional peoples in Madagascar, he just never stopped, but he turned his focus to his own society. Essays such as

<p>Levy reflects on the creative women who have inspired her, in essays that range from the trivial to the profound</p><p>‘It is a writing adventure to go in deep, then deeper, and then to play&nbsp;with surface so that we become experts at surface and depth,” writes Deborah Levy, and it’s as good&nbsp;a&nbsp;statement of intent as any in this collection, which delves into topics both trivial and profound: brothel creepers, car crashes, lemon curd, trauma.</p><p>The theme, insofar as there is one, is the artists who have inspired her. Many of these are women, and Levy writes skilfully on the complex interplay of self-presentation and effacement that’s often demanded of female creativity. Lee Miller “both hides from&nbsp;and gives herself to the camera”; Francesca Woodman makes “herself present by making herself absent”. Artists and writers invent things, but they invent themselves too. The first essay is about Colette, less her&nbsp;“transgressive and sensuous” writing, and more her

<p>Prime minister’s chief fixer says UK relationship with US is strong and will continue with Trump in the White House</p><p>Good morning. The election of Donald Trump as the next US president will create profound challenges for Labour, and for many governments around the world, and 24 hours on we are starting to get a better sense of how Labour will respond. <strong>Pat McFadden</strong>, the Cabinet Office minister and Keir Starmer’s lead political “fixer” in government has just finished a media round where he has been talking about almost nothing else. And the strategy that is emerging? Be nice, and hope for the best.</p><p>Starmer has been working hard to establish a good relationship with Trump since he became PM and we saw more of this last night, when he had his first call with the president-elect. No 10 issues a readout when the PM has a call with a foreign leader, and normally these are among the most dry, boring and uninformative press releases to come out of Whitehall. But

A 300ft-high plasterboard Babylon, with walls wide enough to shoot chariot races on, it was flanked by giant white elephants (oh the symbolism!). Intolerance (1916), a three-and-a-half-hour silent movie, performed so catastrophically at the box office that its megalomaniac creator DW Griffiths couldn’t afford to demolish the set. For years it remained, crumbling, as a warning to Hollywood – “Look on my works, ye mighty, and despair!”</p><p>Thankfully Hollywood didn’t give two hoots, because otherwise we’d have missed out on Tim Robey’s erudite and brilliantly entertaining chronicle of movie excess.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/nov/07/box-office-poison-by-tim-robey-review-hollywoods-fascinating-flops">Continue reading.
