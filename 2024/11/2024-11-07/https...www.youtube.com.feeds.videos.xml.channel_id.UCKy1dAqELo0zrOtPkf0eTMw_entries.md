Instead, it introduces a handful of distinct innovations to the tactics genre that masterfully meld Metal Slug’s action-packed platforming and shooting onto a grid. Even with some frustrating bugs, there is plenty of fun to have on each run as you experiment with new strategies and team compositions.

Here's why Uncharted 2 is the most important PlayStation exclusive ever! In a list of games that defined the PS3 (PlayStation 3), Uncharted 2: Among Thieves would certainly be one of the top contenders. The blockbuster sequel to 2007’s Uncharted: Drake’s Fortune not only received critical acclaim and became a massive hit for Sony’s third console when it was released 15 years ago on October 13th, 2009, but it also cemented Naughty Dog’s future as a developer of cinematic, story-driven action-adventure games as opposed to its history of colorful platformers like Crash Bandicoot and Jak and Daxter from previous PlayStation generations. To this day, Uncharted 2 stands as one of the best PS3 exclusives and one of the most important PlayStation games of all time.

In today's Daily Fix:
Nintendo's president, Shuntaro Furukawa, has confirmed that Nintendo Switch games will be backward-compatible with the upcoming Switch 2. Specifically, he said Switch software will be compatible, but this likely also means physical cartridges will also work on the new console. In other news, Blizzard could be working on a remaster for WarCraft 2: Tides of Darkness. The game originally hit PC way back in 1995, and could definitely use a fresh coat of paint. The info comes from an internal update at Blizzard, which featured some art and an update that the project has at least hit the alpha stage. And finally, back to Nintendo, the company gave a vague update about the release window for The Legend of Zelda live-action movie.
