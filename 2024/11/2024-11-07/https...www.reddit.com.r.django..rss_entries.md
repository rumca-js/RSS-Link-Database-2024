It’s been a while since I started working on a small social media app using Flutter and Firebase. The app includes features like news, comments, likes, dislikes, and user rankings based on likes and dislikes. I managed to write about half of the project, but then I realized that my data model was flawed. I became stuck trying to figure out how to implement batch write for likes and dislikes, so I ended up abandoning the project after three months.</p> <p>Now, a friend of mine has asked me to create a web app for diet tracking. I’m fairly comfortable with Django, as I&#39;ve completed a couple of projects using it. However, this new project feels quite large, and I’m worried that I might get confused again in the middle of development.</p> <p>How can I improve my database design skills? Is it okay to use tools like ChatGPT for assistance? I tried i
