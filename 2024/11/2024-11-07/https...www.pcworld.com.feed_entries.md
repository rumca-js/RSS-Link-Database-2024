<p>If you do any video editing work, you probably know how taxing it can be on your laptop. So, when browsing for a laptop for video editing, you’ll want to make sure your rig is suited up with the proper hardware. Depending on your work load, you may not need a top-tier machine to get the job done. That said, a gaming laptop may not be the right choice, especially one with a lower resolution display. A powerful processor and graphics are a given, but you’ll need to take other factors into consideration such as the quality of the display and port selection.</p>



<p><strong>Why you should trust us:</strong> PCWorld has been covering PCs since 1983, and reviews more than 70 notebooks a year in our never-ending quest to find <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/436674/the-best-pc-laptops-of-the-year.html">the best laptops</a>.

## AMD’s desktop CPU share soars 10 percentage points in a year

<p>AMD’s desktop CPU market share jumped nearly 10 percent in the last year, an analyst reported Thursday, on the heels of AMD’s strong rollout of its latest desktop gaming CPU.</p>



<p>Mercury Research, which tracks the market share of PC CPUs from AMD, Intel, and Qualcomm, reported sweeping gains in most segments of the CPU market. A portion of the report specific to AMD was provided to journalists by AMD, but confirmed by Mercury.</p>



<p>In general, because of the relatively low share of Qualcomm Snapdragon X CPUs, any share gains AMD realizes usually reflect a corresponding drop in Intel’s market share. </p>



<p>AMD’s results were excellent: The company’s desktop market share, in units, increased by 9.6 percentage points year-over-year, to 28.7 percent. In mobile, AMD now holds 22.3 percent of the CPU market, an increase of 2.8 percentage points.

<p>An instant Ctrl-Z undo is a popular gag in science fiction, and it has some obvious benefits for gamers, with beloved titles like <em>Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time </em>and <em>Braid </em>built around the idea. But what if you could apply it to every game, at any time? Sony’s working on it, or at least it got a lawyer to patent the idea of a dedicated rewind button on a game controller.</p>



<p><a href="https://tech4gamers.com/sony-patents-game-rewind-feature/">Tech4Gamers</a> spotted the United States patent filing in <a href="https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=US441926914&_fid=WO2024226821">PatentScope</a>. The patent was published by the USPTO on October 31, so it’s pretty darn fresh as these things go — Sony only applied for the patent about a year and a half ago. The dense legalese basically describes the action of pressi

## Best free password managers 2024: Online security doesn’t have to cost a thing

<p>You should definitely be using a password manager. Data breaches now happen constantly—and that flood of stolen info has made cracking passwords even easier. And it’s not just the “password12345” variety that is at risk, but also passwords that use variations on a single password or substitute numbers for letters. Even if you’re using unique, random passwords, storing them in a document or spreadsheet is not truly keeping them safe and secure.</p>



<p>While <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3207185/best-password-managers-reviews-and-buying-advice.html">paid password managers</a> offer nice extras, a free password manager still protects you from the risks of using weak passwords (or worse, using the same one everywhere).

<p>Charging two devices at once doesn’t necessarily require a multi-port wall plug — if you purchase the right cable. For example, Anker has a special USB-C cable that splits into two so you can handle two devices at once with a single USB-C port.</p>



<p>And the coolest part? Right now, you can get <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Charging-Samsung-MacBook-Braided/dp/B0CRZ6JJ6D/">this 2-in-1 Anker USB-C cable for just $20 on Amazon</a> — that’s 23 percent off — with a Prime membership. (Don’t have Prime? You can <a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime">sign up for a 30-day free trial</a> to snag this deal anyway!)</p>



<p>This 4-foot USB-C cable saves you the trouble of packing multiples when you travel or digging around for an extra cable (or even an extra plug) when you want to charge your phone and Kindle at the same time.</p>

<p>If there’s one smart home device everyone should own these days, it’s a smart home security camera. It just so happens that the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Battery-security-privacy-controls/dp/B0C5QRZ47P/">Ring Stick Up Cam Battery is on sale for $55 on Amazon</a>, its best price yet. That’s a whopping 45 percent discount off its original $100 price!</p>



<p>Just stick one of these on the wall outside your home and you’ll get instant access to live video whenever someone visits you. Whether that’s a delivery person or family dropping by, you’ll have a recording of it — and even better, you can chat with them in real time through the Ring app, which can be handy for giving delivery instructions, for instance.</p>



<p>It also works pretty well at night and other low-light conditions, with the camera able to capture colorful images in 1080p, som

<p>The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has made some pretty big changes to how companies are allowed to present themselves on the internet, effectively outlawing fake reviews, reviews posted by company employees, fake review sites, AI-generated reviews, etc.</p>



<p>One of the first tests of the FTC’s new policies is a B2B service called Sitejabber, which the Commission has cracked down on.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/11/ftc-order-against-ai-enabled-review-platform-sitejabber-will-ensure-consumers-get-truthful-accurate?utm_campaign=ftc_order_against_ai-enab&utm_content=1730920032&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter">public news post,</a> the FTC charges Sitejabber’s owner GGL Projects, Inc. with violations of the policy.

<p>Updates for newer Windows versions are often downloaded in the background and installed automatically on the next reboot. This is usually a good thing: The system remains up to date, security gaps are closed, or practical new features and functions are added — as was recently the case with <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2472367/windows-11-2024-update-24h2-how-and-when-youll-get-it.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2472367/windows-11-2024-update-24h2-how-and-when-youll-get-it.html">Windows 11 24H2</a>.</p>



<p>Sometimes, however, this is not a good thing at all: Sometimes the system fails to update, updates are only downloaded incompletely, or are even faulty from the outset.

<p>There are a few keyboard shortcuts on Windows computers that nearly everyone knows: Ctrl + C to copy, Ctrl + V to paste, maybe even Ctrl + Shift + Esc to open the Task Manager, Ctrl + Alt + Delete to bring up the special login options menu, and Alt + Tab to switch windows.</p>



<p>But if you use Alt + Tab a lot, you might have run into an annoying bug after updating to Windows 11 24H2 where the Alt + Tab keyboard shortcut results in freezes or an empty black screen.</p>

<p>Massive data leaks and breaches are continually piling faster upon each other—just in the last few months, we learned about a few billion records lost through National Public Data, another few million through Medicare, and 100 million through MC2 Data. Companies that handle background checks and other data processing services just aren’t securing the sensitive data flowing through their fingers.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, we the public must take the brunt of the consequences, which comes in the form of higher risk of fraud, identity theft, account takeovers, and other schemes seeking to rob of us our money.</p>



<p>But you don’t have to leave yourself open to such attacks—at least, not wide open. You can make it more difficult for bad actors to steal from you. Because your time is just as precious as your cash, and trying to recover from a successful scam
