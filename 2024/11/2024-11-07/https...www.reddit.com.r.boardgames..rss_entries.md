However, it&#39;s important to be transparent about risks. </p> <p>One immediate impact of the US election outcome is that the elected party has proposed trade tariffs, specifically on imports from China. </p> <p>This would have a significant impact on the board game industry, including this campaign. The games are set to arrive in the US in roughly mid-February, which will hopefully be too early in the administration for any tariffs to have been enacted, but I cannot say for certain.</p> <p>If the tariffs ARE imposed by that point, what might happen is that when the games arrive at the US port, I will be charged potentially up to 60% of the value of the games to import them to the US (that&#39;s about $100,000USD), which would be financially devastating. It will not impact your receipt of the game, but it may potentially affect my ability to sell

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey all! Me and a group of about 10 people are throwing a surprise birthday party for a friend and want to do a murder mystery game to make things extra memorable and special. The birthday girl is a huge fan of true crimes/a good puzzling situation. We are a group of people late 20s to mid 30s. It doesn&#39;t necessarily need to be a board game or have a lengthy scripted aspect, just have a solid plot that will keep the group engaged. I am open to formats where there is a host that does not participate. Thank you!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Pomegranatebabyyy"> /u/Pomegranatebabyyy </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1glewnn/murder_mystery_party_game_for_a_surprise_birthday/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1glewnn/murder_mystery_party_game_for_a_surprise_birthday/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey, yall! Ok, so I played this game that was chess like?? But I can&#39;t find the name ToT</p> <p>It has a grid board (but the version I played was a roll out mat), and the X and Y-axis were bolded. You play with these little plastic see-through beads and you have to put them on where the little corners. The first person to go has to put the bead in the origin/center, and the goal is to get 5 in a row. You can capture two of someone else&#39;s beads by putting one of yours on each end. I think about four people can play?</p> <p>Ok so, list of everything I remember:</p> <ul> <li>Four-ish person game? Or just multiple color options</li> <li>Colors of beads: Red, Green, Blue, Yellow?</li> <li>Grid, X &amp; Y-axis bolded</li> <li>You can win by vvv</li> <li>A- is 5 in a row</li> <li>B- capture I think 5 pairs of someone else&#39;s beads</li> <li>You can capture beads by putting one of your beads on each side of two of someone else&#39;s beads</li> </ul
