## I’m a ‘trad wife’ in a happy marriage. How can I get my friends to accept me for who I am? | Leading questions

<p>To your friends, your relationship is probably the least interesting about you, writes advice columnist <strong>Eleanor Gordon-Smith</strong>. Try to remember what drew you to these people in the first place</p><p><strong>I think I am in some sort of version of what people call a ‘trad marriage’ but it has its twists and turns</strong><strong>. I met my husband when I was 25. I dropped out of university, got involved with drugs and drinking too much, and my self-esteem was at rock bottom.</strong></p><p><strong>One night I ended up at a party with people I didn’t know and someone slipped something in my drink and I lost all memory until the next morning when I woke up on the sofa in a strange man’s apartment. He had rescued me and taken me to his place. I didn’t leave his flat for three months, except to be taken out to dinner and sent off to a gym to get back in shape.</strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/nov/08/trad-wife-happy-marriage-friends-advi

<p>Hold on to your hat: Manchester United are victorious in Europe after three consecutive Europa League draws and three more without winning in last term’s Champions League.</p><p>So a 380-day drought stretching to a 1-0 win over Copenhagen here on 24&nbsp;October 2023 ends courtesy of Amad Diallo, whose explosive wing play was crowned by his double. The first was a clever ­51st-minute header. The second proved an exhibition of aggressiveness as he mugged Abdul Baba along the right, shrugged off the latter’s manhandling, then fired a laser into the left corner, via a deflection.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/07/manchester-united-paok-europa-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

## Victor Osimhen leads Galatasaray to action-packed victory as Spurs see red

<p>This was the kind of breathless, wild encounter in which both Galatasaray and Tottenham deal routinely and the only surprise was a goal tally that did no justice to a game whose openness beggared belief. In truth Spurs should have been blown to smithereens by hosts who had no idea how to apply the handbrake and had unloaded 28 shots by the end. A stunner from Yunus Akgun and two goals from Victor Osimhen, who had countless other chances, completed their tally by half-time but somehow Ange Postecoglou’s side remained in with a sniff until matters concluded.</p><p>That was partly due to a first senior goal for the 19-year-old Will Lankshear, who celebrated in front of a baying home support but was chastened on the hour by a second yellow card. Dominic Solanke offered an unlikely lifeline later on and, although no leveller was forthcoming, this defeat should have little impact on Tottenham’s chances of reaching the knockout stage.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/202

But Kamala Harris was right: we must carry on the fight</p><p>With wailing woe in the small hours, many of you shared that wrenching despair when the US election result extinguished hope. Beyond reason, beyond reckoning, a nation that was once the beacon of the democratic world has knowingly elected a dangerous, racist demagogue, a “pussy-grabbing” criminal who tried to overthrow the government, a wild conspiracy spreader, a squalid, reckless beast of fathomless vanity and corruption. Caligula, Commodus, Nero, Domitian … This is the way a civilisation dies: by suicide not murder.</p><p>Donald Trump could now command <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c04ld19vlg6o">both houses of Congress</a> and the supreme court, with no steadying countervailing instinct for national self-preservation. “America first” means no allies, no “special relationships”, tariffs for all.

From athletics to swimming, rowing to basketball, football to fencing, almost all international federations adhere to the principle of “one nation, one vote”.

Since the figures for England and Wales were released last week, we’ve heard the same old theories. The cost of living means that couples can’t afford to start a family. Career-hungry women are eschewing children. Childcare and house prices mean that families are reluctant to expand.</p><p>Yet these analyses ignore a key group: those who would like to have children with a partner but are single. In a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405661820300216">2021 survey</a> of women who were “childless by circumstance”, of those<strong> </strong>women who wanted children but had not tried to have them, four in 10 said this was because of the lack of a partner.

<p>Spat between Sexton and Ioane has added another layer of intrigue to first meeting since 2023 quarter-final </p><p>In Ireland we have a curious custom of thanking the bus driver when he or she pulls up at our stop.

Now, returning with Emily Armstrong as frontwoman, they remain just as dynamic</p><p>In September, Linkin Park’s comeback single The Emptiness Machine entered the UK singles chart at No 4. You could see that as an extraordinary state of affairs: an august metal band whose lead singer died seven years ago – recently replaced with the largely unknown Emily Armstrong – gatecrashing a Top 5 that spent most of 2024 as the exclusive domain of a handful of pop and pop-dance artists, most of them too young to remember the 2000 release of Linkin Park’s debut album Hybrid Theory first-hand.</p><p>Then again, perhaps not. For one thing, the nu-metal scene that birthed them has been enjoying a resurgence in interest: quite aside from a wave of early 00s nostalgia, there’s an intriguing correlation between the genre’s feel-my-pain angst and the emotional tenor of latter-day pop.

He won despite the fact that most Americans say they don’t approve of him. His scabrous campaign, which grew ever more unhinged, served to certify him as the protest candidate. His racism, nativism and misogyny stoked the divisions that Republicans have preyed on for decades.

<p>The remarkable story of a brilliant musician and producer is told in this surreal but also strangely wrongheaded film</p><p>Pharrell Williams’s life … only it’s Lego. A fun idea – like Muhammad Ali in Etch-a-Sketch or Harry and Meghan with Thunderbirds puppets. This is a film that is boisterously childlike, surreal and eager to please, but also (I couldn’t help thinking) a strangely wrongheaded attempt to use Lego graphics to tell the remarkable, complex story of a brilliant musician and producer. Try as I might, I couldn’t make friends with this much-acclaimed film.</p><p>Piece By Piece is of course inspired by the amazing success of The Lego Movie franchise but doesn’t have those films’ crazy ironic knowingness or comedy stylings. On the contrary it is a basically heartfelt approach to Williams’s story, using real voices on the soundtrack but with Lego dramatisations of episodes in his life, as well as Lego dramatisations of one-to-one interviews with director Morgan Neville.

<p>The 1895 comedy has been staged with age-blind and all-male casts and even David Suchet as Lady Bracknell. Now reinvented again, at the National Theatre, the trick is to be seriously funny</p><p>I can’t think of many plays that have left such a strong footprint as The Importance of Being Earnest. Wilde’s comedy has been parodied, pastiched and plundered by, among others, Tom Stoppard, Alan Bennett and Joe Orton. It has been filmed several times, inspired musicals and an opera and is one of the most quoted plays in the language. Yet, as Max Webster’s new production is about to open at the National Theatre, it strikes me that Wilde’s work is still the subject of endless debate. What kind of play is it and how do we stage it today? These are the questions that still divide opinion.</p><p>People have been arguing about the true nature of the play ever since its premiere in 1895. Wilde himself described it as “a delicate bubble of fancy”, but added: “It has its philosophy.” At the time

Hadley, usually a writer of&nbsp;bourgeois households, strong on gardens and antique furniture, has a&nbsp;good time with dereliction, adding memorably to the literature of urination when the sisters can’t find a&nbsp;loo. Evelyn has just started a BA in French and is working with sweet self-consciousness on her transformation into adulthood, hyper-aware of her clothes and manners and vocabulary in the way of a young adult changing class.

I attended court every day to try to understand the killers’ motivations and hear from those whose lives had been irrevocably changed</p><p>Noon, 8 September 2021. Central Paris, Île de la Cité. The trial that gets under way today will not be the Nuremberg of terrorism, as some have said: whereas high Nazi dignitaries were put on trial in Nuremberg, here the defendants are second stringers, since those who did the killing are dead. Nevertheless, this trial too will be enormous, unprecedented, something I want to witness. Without being a specialist in Islam – let alone in Arab studies – I am interested in religions, their pathological mutations and the question: where does this pathology begin? When it comes to God, where does the madness start? What goes on in these guys’ minds? But the main reason I want to spend a year attending this trial is that hundreds of human beings will
