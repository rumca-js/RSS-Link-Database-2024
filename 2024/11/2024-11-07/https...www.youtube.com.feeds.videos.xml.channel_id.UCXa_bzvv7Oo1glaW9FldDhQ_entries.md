At one point in time, Microsoft's Flight Simulator was just Flight Simulator, and it was the premiere flight simulator. While it went into dormancy for a time, the franchise made a huge comeback with Microsoft Flight Simulator in 2020. The sequel is finally upon us with Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, which is bigger and hopefully better in every single way.

Whether it's the sheer increase in size and attention to detail, the ability to walk outside and explore 27 different biomes, over 120 available aircraft, new systems, a Flight Planner, and a new Career Mode, there is a mind-boggling amount of stuff to do in Flight Sim 2024. That's not even including the Challenge League or World Photographer modes.

Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 launches on November 19th for Xbox Series X/S and PC. Here's what you should know about it, including the hardware required to achieve "ideal specs" on PC.
