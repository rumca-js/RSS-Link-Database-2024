Dr. Jordan B. Peterson sits down with podcaster, author, and icon carver Jonathan Pageau. They discuss Jonathan’s new book release, “Jack and the Fallen Giants,” the depth of fairy tales when they are not propagandized, Jordan’s recent conversation with Richard Dawkins, the hierarchies of being and their relation to goals, and how the spirit of Adam is the best combatant against the spirit of Cain.

Jonathan Pageau is a French-Canadian liturgical artist and icon carver, known for his work featured in museums across the world. He carves Eastern Orthodox and other traditional images and teaches an online carving class. He also runs a YouTube channel dedicated to the exploration of symbolism across history and religion.
