Usually you have to renew every year, so they can free up inactive slots, and Apple may revoke the certificate, but you should be issued a new one.</li> <li> Using whatever initial method is provided by whoever you bought it through, sideload Feather (<a href="https://github.com/khcrysalis/Feather/releases/latest">https://github.com/khcrysalis/Feather/releases/latest</a>) get the .ipa file, not .tipa.</li> <li> Whoever you bought
