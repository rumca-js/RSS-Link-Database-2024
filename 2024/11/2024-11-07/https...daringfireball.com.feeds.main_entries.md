## The Brutal Clarity of This Result

<p>Taegan Goddard, Political Wire:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>After last night, it became clear it was a mistake to dismiss
Trump’s true political strength. He will win the 2024 election
with at least 51% of the popular vote.</p>

<p>His win will not be the result of a constitutional quirk. It was
not even the result of a bad campaign by Kamala Harris. His
victory was so broad based I’m not sure any Democrat could have
beaten him last night.</p>

<p>There’s a brutal clarity in this result.</p>

<p>The majority of Americans are not concerned with Trump’s blatant
racism or sexism. They are not concerned with his vows of
retribution on his political enemies. They are not concerned with
warnings of “fascism” by his former top aides. They are not
concerned with his extensive criminal and fraudulent behavior.</p>

<p>If there’s a takeaway from this election, it’s that this is
who we are.</p>

<p>Not all of us, to be sure. But it makes clear what the rest of us
are up against.</p>
