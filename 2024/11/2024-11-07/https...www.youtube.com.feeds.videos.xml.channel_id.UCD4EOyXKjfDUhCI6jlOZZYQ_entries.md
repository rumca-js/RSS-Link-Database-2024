When building your application you need to think about where it will "live" once you're ready to deploy it. You may have heard people say that your app should or should not be on the "cloud" but don't really understand what that means.

In this class we'll go over what the cloud really is and the things you need to consider if you plan to deploy your project.

We'll Discuss:
- What the cloud is
- Public and Private Infrastructure
- SaaS, PaaS, IaaS, MaaS, etc
- Hypervisors
- Containers
- Security Considerations
- Disaster Recovery
- and more...
