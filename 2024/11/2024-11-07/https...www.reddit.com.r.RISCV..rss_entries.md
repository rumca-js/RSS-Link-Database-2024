<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I was looking for a cheap tablet and happened to noticed there&#39;s a risc-v micro embedded in one of the cheapest SoCs (as a PMU) and that there&#39;s also an SBC around though I couldn&#39;t find an SDK...</p> <p>Anyone messed around with one of these? I don&#39;t expect it&#39;s going to be usable under android (I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s only being used by the kernel by loading up a blob early during the boot to manage the battery or the likes...) but I figure it won&#39;t hurt to ask given how I did end up order one of these.</p> <p>thx</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Background_Cow_9373"> /u/Background_Cow_9373 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1glzo0e/any_info_on_the_xuantie_e903_core_in_the/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1glzo0e/any_info_on_the_xuantie_e903_core_in_the/">[comments]</a></span>

I don&#39;t have much knowledge on Verilog and we have a month&#39;s time to complete. If anyone could suggest a simple RISCV project that&#39;ll be really helpful since I&#39;m completely confused on what to do</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Strange-Company-8073"> /u/Strange-Company-8073 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1gle76b/suggestions_for_a_simple_custom_riscv_processor/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1gle76b/suggestions_for_a_simple_custom_riscv_processor/">[comments]</a></span>
