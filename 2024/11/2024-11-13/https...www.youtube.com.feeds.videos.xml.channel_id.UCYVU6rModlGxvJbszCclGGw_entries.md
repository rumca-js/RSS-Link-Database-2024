Pollsters told us right to the day before the election that the race was tied at 48.5 to 48.5 between Kamala and Trump. And this turned out (again) to be completely wrong. Trump was ahead even in the popular vote by 4-5% (based on current count which is still ongoing).

Why was this? Why did they get it wrong?
