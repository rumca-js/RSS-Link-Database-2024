Mentor: Nathan Chancellor, Linux Kernel and LLVM Developer

Usage of the LLVM toolchain (clang, ld.lld, etc) to build the Linux kernel is starting to increase amongst enterprises and users. Learn what the benefits of such usage are, how to use the toolchain to build the kernel, how to tackle potential problems encountered throughout usage of the LLVM toolchain, and what specific machinery and features exists in Kbuild to easily work with LLVM.
