<p><a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2176798/docker-tutorial-get-started-with-docker.html">Docker containers</a> are meant to be immutable, meaning the code and data they hold never change. Immutability is useful when you want to be sure the code running in production is the same as the code that passed QA testing; it’s not so useful when you need to write data and persist it across application lifetimes.</p>



<p>Most of the time, you can address the need for data persistence by using an external database. But sometimes an application in a container just needs to use a local file system, or something that looks like a local file system.</p>

<p>After Java, <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2256390/what-is-kotlin-the-java-alternative-explained.html">Kotlin</a> is the most popular <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2269370/what-is-the-jvm-introducing-the-java-virtual-machine.html">JVM language</a>. Kotlin is an expressive, concise language with strong functional programming support. It’s especially appealing to Java developers because it is fully interoperable with Java, and the syntax is an easy transition. Let’s take a look at this dynamic programming language.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3599609/why-scrum-is-dumb.html">Last week I went on a short rant about scrum</a>, and how it isn’t agile and is, well, dumb. It occurred to me that one of the obstacles to truly being agile has been the limits of software technology. The way we had to build and deliver software didn’t lend itself to flexibility. However, we are gradually moving to a new way of development that lets us be flexible and agile.</p>



<p>One of the reasons that everyone wants to be agile is that there was (and still is) a huge backlash against the waterfall method. The waterfall method basically went like this:</p>
