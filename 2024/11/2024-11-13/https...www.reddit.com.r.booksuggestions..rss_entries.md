I was hoping to find memoirs or other related types that go into details of such experiences. I always wondered what it would be like to be in their position so I&#39;m hoping there&#39;s some literature that share their perspectives. POVs from family, friends or professionals are fine too!

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Some of my favorites books are books where lucky coincidences lead to funny favorable outcomes. For my anime fans, think King in OPM, where a series of horrifically improbably lucky coincidences lead everyone into thinking a normal person is extremely strong.</p> <p>One great book that does this is “How to beat a bully without really trying” where the main character is a wuss who moves to a new school. A series of extremely lucky events make him the local badass and grant him a super crazy reputation that he definitely does not deserve. </p> <p>Anyone have book recommendations that embody this theme? Of the main character getting lucky over and over and gaining an incorrect reputation for it?</p> <p>Alternatively, I also like to read about self interested main characters that are misinterpreted by the people around them as selfless. If anyone reads light novels, think Cale Henituse from Trash of the Counts Family or Lee Kiyoung from Regressor Instruc

I love fantasy books (but I did not like ACOTAR) and I thought about rereading Circe or Eragon (my comfort series) but I just finished Eragon and frankly that might be too upsetting in its own right. I enjoyed The Will of the Many, The Bloodsworn trilogy (though I haven&#39;t read the third one and it might be too intense for me to start at the moment), Fourth Wing, and many others. I&#39;d like something more light hearted but in that area I think. I could be seated on other genres if it&#39;s the right book. </p> <p>
