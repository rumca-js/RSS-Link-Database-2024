## Factorio: Space Age or Dwarf Fortress?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So as a broke gamer I like to buy games on the cheap. However, I can only get one of the two in the title.</p> <p>I have played and finished Factorio only once, and I love the game. Dwarf Fortress I&#39;ve never played, but I have played Rimworld and that&#39;s one of my favourite games of all time, which is apparently inspired by Dwarf Fortress.</p> <p>So of the two, which is the better purchase? They&#39;re about equal in price so it&#39;s either or.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/RickyWicky"> /u/RickyWicky </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1gq8ofi/factorio_space_age_or_dwarf_fortress/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1gq8ofi/factorio_space_age_or_dwarf_fortress/">[comments]</a></span>

## Steam Deck or competitor?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Just one more question from an already more-than-helpful sub. I posted the other day about pros and cons of a Steam Deck.</p> <p>Also looking at more powerful competing units, namely the ROG Ally. </p> <p>I&#39;m reading the Ally can usually handle newer games, but the battery life sucks. Steam has longer life and much better service. </p> <p>I know Lenovo also makes a similar unit, but I know next to nothing about it. For those that didn&#39;t come across my previous post, I&#39;d really like something I can use to play older Fallout titles and Witcher games, among others, as Steam is the only place I can find them these days.</p> <p>I&#39;m heavily leaning toward the Deck (also on sale on Walmart&#39;s app right now). Anyone own other units that can give me more info? Thanks again for all the advice. Just getting into PC gaming so I have a lot of questions.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ATC_a
