Blizzard confirmed during its recent Warcraft 30th Anniversary Direct that the long-asked-for feature will be part of the MMORPG's future Midnight expansion, saving the biggest crowd-pleasing announcement of the livestream for last.</p><p dir="ltr">In a short teaser video, a Death Knight walks into a nondescript house. Inside, the walls are adorned with the head of the dragon Onyxia, various weapons and shields, a miniature Goblin shredder mech, and more.

Titled Undermined, the 11.1 update is slated to arrive early next year, and will introduce a new raid, dungeon, two new delves, and kick-off The War Within Season 2.</p><p dir="ltr">Vehicles in WoW aren't exactly new, but its never had something like this.

<p>On November 12, Sony published a marketing trailer for the PlayStation 5 that ended with the announcement that the digital PS5 Slim would be marked down for the holidays.

While it has been cycled in and out of the PS Plus library before, Grand Theft Auto 5 is still a fine game for some outlaw fun, but if you're looking for something to keep you on the edge of your seat, Dying Light 2 is an effective combo of zombies and parkour action.</p><p>For fans of the Yakuza games, Like a Dragon: Ishin will also be available this month in case you want to experience an inaccurate period of history set during a crucial era for Japan. Did samurai warriors from that era really receive assistance from AEW wrestlers when they got into fights? Historical records from that time are spotty at best, so we'll never know.</p><p>A

<p dir="ltr">While all eyes are on Monster Hunter Wilds, Capcom has unveiled a brand-new game for mobile devices (App Store and Google Play) in the franchise called Monster Hunter Outlanders. The company is teaming up with TiMi Studio Group, known for its work on Call of Duty Mobile and Pokemon Unite.</p><p dir="ltr">Monster Hunter Outlanders is being described as an open-world survival game, offering solo play as well as co-op for up to four people. The announcement trailer--seen below--interestingly enough doesn't showcase any combat for the title, instead focusing on mobility.

<p>Following the tragic <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-horizon-and-john-wick-star-lance-reddick-dies-at-60/1100-6512458/">death of actor Lance Reddick in 2023</a>, Horizon fans were curious about what the fate of his character Sylens would be. With the release of Lego Horizon Adventures this week, it has been confirmed--in that spin-off game at least--that Sylens does appear and is voiced by Star Trek Voyager actor Tim Russ.</p><p>A deuteragonist in the games, Sylens is similar to Horizon's hero Aloy in several ways, as he also explores the secret history of the world following a cataclysmic event that saw machines rise to the top of the food chain. Russ is no stranger to the Horizon series, as he'd previously played the character Jetakka in Horizon Forbidden West.
