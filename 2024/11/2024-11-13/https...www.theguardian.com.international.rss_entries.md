The war between Sega and Nintendo that defined the early 1990s was in the rear-view mirror – the PlayStation had knocked both of them off their perch, and Microsoft had released the Xbox.

 In 1975 the former heavyweight champion Foreman takes on five opponents on the same afternoon in bouts of three three-minute rounds each in Toronto. Muhammad Ali is ringside providing withering putdowns for the ABC television network six months on from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/27/rumble-in-the-jungle-50-years-on-how-ali-danced-rings-around-apartheid">their colossal “Rumble in the Jungle”</a>. Foreman, who is attempting to rebuild his reputation, takes on respectable fighters in Alonzo Johnson, Pedro Agosto, Mac Foster, Terry Daniels and Boone Kirkman. To a background of booing, Foreman wins the lot. “I’d put on a show. I’d fought five guys, and I’d made it through. It was a big victory for me,’ he says afterwards.</p><p><strong>Muhammad Ali v Antonio ‘The Pelican’ Inoki</strong><b

But whenever she could, Longdale would sneak in a few hours playing EverQuest’s main competitor instead.

<p>Scientists tell us the same piece of work is judged more harshly if it’s handed in late – but that won’t stop me taking my time</p><p>It’s a classic dilemma. A deadline is coming up, but you’re not quite finished. Do you hand in the work on time in its half-baked state, or do you miss the deadline, use the extra time to improve the work and hand it in late? Now, it seems, we have a scientific answer to this question. A <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0749597824000578">study published</a> in the journal Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes this month found that the same piece of work is judged more harshly if it is handed in late than if it is handed in on time. Procrastinate at your peril, the study suggests, because it really does matter if you don’t make that deadline.</p><p>This news didn’t strike fear into my heart for a couple of reasons. First, it feels intuitive. If you go to a restaurant and order food, and then it takes ages

After years of stop-start relationships and a broken engagement, he led me to a happier world</p><p>When I got engaged in 2002, I was 33. Somehow, after growing up on a self-sufficient farm in the 1970s, I had bolted to London at 17 and ended up in the fast lane as a freelance journalist, writing about sex, parties and cars. My 20s were full of stop-start love affairs and crazy jobs. I was unsure of who I was, scared, fun-seeking, defensively cynical and desperate to write, and I suspect I wasn’t entirely lovable or reliable. But after meeting my fiance I thought I was on the home straight to a wedding and kids.</p><p>About a year into our engagement, I pitched an idea to a women’s magazine. What if I hosted a dinner party for 12 single people to “see what happens”? The magazine agreed, saying they’d confirm the details later in the summer.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/nov/13/a

In the case of Bad Sisters, it’s cause for a fair amount of scepticism – and a sliver of hope. That’s because the Dublin-set whodunnit’s original run – a stunningly engineered split-timeline story of ultimate revenge against an abusive husband (a mesmerisingly monstrous Claes Bang) – was so perfectly self-contained. We knew from the start that John Paul – married to the guileless Grace (Anne-Marie Duff), and the bane of her four sisters’ lives – was dead, but not why. We witnessed Grace’s siblings repeatedly fail to murder the man they’d rechristened The Prick – while, in the present day, Claffin &amp; Sons insurers tried to avoid a pay-out by proving the women <em>had</em> killed him – yet we were kept in the dark about his act
