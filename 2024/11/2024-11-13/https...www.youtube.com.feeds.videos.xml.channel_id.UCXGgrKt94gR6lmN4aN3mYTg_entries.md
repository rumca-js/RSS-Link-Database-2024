I had an incredible opportunity to sit down with McLaren F1 driver Lando Norris in Austin, thanks to our friends at Dropbox. We dove deep into everything from his tech setup during races to his surprising journey into motorsport (spoiler: it started with horses!). Along the way, I finally got an answer to whether someone like me could actually drive an F1 car - and his answer might surprise you.
