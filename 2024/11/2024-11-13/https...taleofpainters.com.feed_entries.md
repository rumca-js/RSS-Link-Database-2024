<p>In this review, we go through all 60 new Two Thin Coats paints from wave 3. Thanks to Kickstarter, Duncan Rhodes' and Trans Atlantis Games' paint range has now grown to over 180 colours, adding more bright paints, washes, and metallics alongside new triads. This includes six vibrant metallic hues ranging from orange to purple and green. A bold expansion or just another heap of paints in an already saturated market?</p>
