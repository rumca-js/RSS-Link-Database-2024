Miller is expected to continue his advocacy for restrictive immigration policies, including limits on H-1B visas. According to a Forbes report, the Trump administration’s stance has often been at odds with economic consensus, which suggests that high-skilled immigrants and international students benefit the U.S. economy. The administration worked to decouple study in the US from work opportunities, particularly through H-1B visa restrictions, making it more challenging for high-skilled foreign nationals to stay and work in the U.S. after graduation.

In Yes Minister, bureaucracy isn’t just a system; it’s a labyrinth engineered to perpetuate itself. The civil servants, led by Sir Humphrey Appleby, expertly stonewall any attempt at change, wielding obscure regulations and jargon as weapons. Similarly, DOGE, spearheaded by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, is set to streamline government. Yet, like Hacker’s ministry, DOGE faces a government machine skilled in red tape and averse to rapid change. DOGE's task—applying startup efficiency to a complex bureaucracy—is an audacious "Manhattan Project" in its own right.
