<p>The alleged operative surfaced in 2019 wearing a camera harness labelled ‘equipment of St Petersburg’ – but sadly this documentary is thin on other details</p><p>Spy Whale does exactly what it says on the tin. It’s a documentary about a whale that was, in all probability – if not in all cetacean consciousness – a spy. For the Russians. In 2019, a beluga whale who would eventually be named Hvaldimir (a portmanteau of the Norwegian word for “whale” and Putin’s first name) approached a fishing boat off Ingøya Island, virtually the northernmost point of Scandinavia. It was wearing a harness that was cutting into its flesh and appeared to be seeking help, as intelligent marine mammals are known to do.</p><p>The boat’s captain, Joar Hesten, radioed for help from Jørgen Ree Wiig – whose job at the Norwegian Directorate of Fisheries it is to free whales who get caught up in fishing equipment – and kept Hvaldimir with the boat by feeding him fish until Wiig could travel the five hours to m

<p>Chelsea’s aspiration of claiming this season’s Women’s Champions League was hardly in danger as Murphy Agnew handed Celtic a shock 22nd-minute lead. It was simply that the potential for an embarrassing evening for one of the luminaries of the Super League became a live one. Briefly, as it transpired.</p><p>Chelsea departed Glasgow’s east end with reputation intact. There was only a stoppage-time red card for Aggie Beever-Jones to irritate Sonia Bompastor. Beever-Jones had received two bookings, the first for re-entering the field without permission. Bompastor felt that situation “could have been avoided” by the match officials.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/13/celtic-chelsea-womens-champions-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The health secretary is right to link investment to accountability, but he must be wary of creating perverse incentives</p><p>For any government contemplating NHS reform, the 2012 Health and Social Care Act is a textbook case of what not to do. Despite promises of “no more pointless reorganisations”, the Tory health secretary Andrew&nbsp;Lansley did just that, abolishing management tiers and imposing new care commissioning and competition systems on reluctant doctors.</p><p>The whole thing was a political nightmare that wasted resources, demoralised staff and undermined public confidence. In an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/sep/18/report-nhs-healthy-life-expectancy-government-policy-health-service">independent report</a> published earlier this year, Lord Darzi described the Lansley method as “<a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/66f42ae630536cb92748271f/Lord-Darzi-Independent-Investigation-of-the-National-Health-Service-in-England-Updat

<p>MPs are right to abolish hereditary seats in the upper house. However, Britain needs a representative second chamber fit for modern democracy</p><p>More than a century ago, the 1911 Parliament Act restricted the House of Lords’ powers under threat of a flood of Liberal appointees. The act boldly <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/1-2/13/introduction/data.xht?view=snippet&amp;amp;wrap=true">declared</a> that “it is intended to substitute for the House of Lords as it at present exists a Second Chamber constituted on a popular instead of hereditary basis, but such substitution cannot be immediately brought into operation”.

<p>Transparency around this emergency process has been miserable as company looks for approval to borrow £3bn more</p><p>Congratulations to Thames Water: it is not going bust early in the new year. Probably. The necessary three-quarters of A-class bondholders <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/nov/13/thames-water-gains-key-support-from-creditors-for-funding-lifeline">have backed a proposal</a> for the company, already drowning in £15bn of debt, to borrow another £3bn at the nose-bleed rate of 9.75% plus a hefty serving of fees on top. And, critically, the numbers are looking good to get permission from bondholders to access £400m of cash reserves.</p><p>A court still has to approve the new £3bn of “super senior” funding – meaning debt that ought to be super-safe because it ranks above both the A class of bonds and the junior Bs.

<p><strong>Royal Albert Hall, London</strong> <br>He may be well into his ninth decade but his seasoned sidemen are still racing to keep up with mercurial twists on new and old songs<br></p><p>You could infer a lot from the way Bob Dylan’s backing band arrange themselves on stage. They form a kind of huddle around their leader, who these days performs mostly at a grand piano centre stage: sometimes seated, more often standing, occasionally not playing it all, but leaning against it, elbows on the lid, as he sings or plays harmonica. Perhaps there’s something protective about this formation. After all, Dylan is now 83; quite an age to be on the ninth leg of a three-year world tour. But even as an octogenarian, Dylan very much gives off the air of someone who can look after himself, thank you.</p><p>It seems more likely their position speaks of a state of high alert. These are musicians for whom the term seasoned professional was invented – longstanding crack sessioneers, men whose col

<p><strong>Park theatre, London</strong> <br>The real-life story of Frankie Lucas, a fighter spurned by Britain’s boxing establishment, is wrenchingly sad but loses power in this telling</p><p>Frankie Lucas might not be a household name as a boxer but he could have been a contender for it. A Windrush-era child from St Vincent, he joined his north London boxing club at nine, showing clear talent. He went on to win a gold medal in the Commonwealth Games, against the odds, before tragic derailment into bad mental health.</p><p>This production, written by Lisa Lintott, charts his rise and fall but is so much in thrall to biographical chronology and blow-by-blow fight reports that the drama fails to come to life. We hear from his girlfriend, Gene (Llewella Gideon), and son, Michael (Daniel Francis-Swaby), but they are narrators offering summaries rather than roundly drawn characters with inner worlds. We never access the emotional world of Lucas (Jazz Lintott, the writer’s son) either.</p

<p>From olive oil to butter, extreme weather is pushing up the cost of living and having a dramatic political impact. Economists need a solution</p><p>In the US, where Donald Trump swept the board last week, it was the experience of sharply increasing essentials prices, from food to energy, that glued together the Republicans’ new electoral coalition. About 75% of those voting Republican reported that they had faced <a href="https://x.com/IsabellaMWeber/status/1854163452526289396">“hardship” or “severe hardship”</a> as a result of price rises; only 25% of Democrats said the same. When Trump asked if Americans felt better now than they did four years ago, the answer for most was a clear no.</p><p>Price surges are having political impacts. In elections this year in three of the world’s largest economies,<strong> </strong>incumbent parties were hammered by voters angry about their helplessness in the face of the steeply rising cost of essentials.</p><p>James Meadway is director of the P
