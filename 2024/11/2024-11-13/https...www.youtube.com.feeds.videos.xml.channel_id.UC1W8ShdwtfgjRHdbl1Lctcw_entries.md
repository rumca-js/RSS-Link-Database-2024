I colorized, restored and created a sound design for this video of Rio De Janeir, Brazil 1940s, Probably during World War II, we can clearly see what's happening in broad daylight

Video Restoration Process:
âœ” FPS boosted to 60 frames per second 
âœ” Image resolution boosted up to HD 
âœ” Improved video sharpness and brightness 
âœ” Colorized only for the ambiance (not historically accurate)
âœ”added sound design only for the ambiance
âœ”restoration:(stabilisation,denoise,cleand,deblur)
