<p>VMware this week announced that the virtualization company’s hypervisor products, VMware Workstation and Fusion, will be completely free for both personal and commercial users, as well as for educational purposes. The move follows a decision last May, when VMware made both Workstation and Fusion free for personal use; those who wanted to use the software for commercial purposes still had to sign up for a paid subscription.</p>



<p>The free versions will have the same functionality as the paid products, but VMware owner Broadcom will not offer troubleshooting support. The old paid versions Workstation Pro and Fusion Pro are no longer available.</p>

<p>Let’s be honest: Many Windows PCs don’t have great webcams. The webcam is often an afterthought where manufacturers cut costs when putting together laptops. And, if you have a desktop PC, you might not even have a webcam <em>at all</em> unless you go out and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393756/1080p-4k-webcam-buying-guide.html" target="_blank">buy one</a>.</p>



<p>But you almost certainly have multiple high-quality cameras built right into your smartphone of choice, whether you use an Android phone or an iPhone. And with the right bit of relatively simple setup, your smartphone’s high-end camera hardware can actually function as your PC’s webcam, too.</p>

<p>With last week’s US elections, everything changed for the tech industry, especially for Microsoft. Given President-elect Donald J. Trump’s penchant for incendiary statements, off-the-cuff decisions, plans to impose massive tariffs, and willingness to use the power of his office for personal vendettas, almost anything could happen.</p>



<p>But based on Trump’s past actions, who he turns to for tech and economic advice, and what he’s said on the campaign trail, there’s a lot we know about how Microsoft will likely be affected by his upcoming four-year reign. </p>



<p>There’s so much, in fact, that it’s more than can be covered in one column. Here, I’ll look at how Trump’s likely plans for AI
