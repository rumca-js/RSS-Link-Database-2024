<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Recently I saw a post online about the game &quot;Whale Riders&quot; by Reiner Knizia, and I was stunned. The game&#39;s art by Vincent Dutraite is absolutely stunning. However when I went to look at reviews by channels that I watch I found barely any. Hell, there&#39;s barely any reddit posts didiscussing this game. If anybody could tell me more about the title, and whether or not it holds up, I would greatly appreciate it. The game is still in print in europe (albeit in spanish) so I may try picking up a copy.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Abeedo-Alone"> /u/Abeedo-Alone </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1gqpani/is_whale_riders_any_good/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1gqpani/is_whale_riders_any_good/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone! I’m hosting a 1930s-themed murder mystery party for my wife&#39;s 30th birthday, and it’s my first time organizing anything like this. I could use some advice on how to make it all come together smoothly!</p> <p>The goal is for the game to stay light, fun, and easygoing without too many pauses in the party itself. Here’s what I’m envisioning so far:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Character Cards/Backstories:</strong> I’d like each guest to receive a character card with a brief backstory about a week or two before the party. This will give them time to get into character and dress the part if they want to go all out with the 1930s vibe.</li> <li><strong>Randomly Assigned Murderers and Victims:</strong> I’m thinking of secretly assigning 2 murderers ahead of time and instructing them to keep their role hidden. Throughout the night, the murderers would select 1–2 “victims” at random, quietly informing them that they’ve been “murdered.” The victim wo

The rules say the game ends if you can&#39;t place a minor on a major but that meant the game was over right away... what point value do the court cards have? </p> <p>We were both very confused.</

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>My group and I want to try Core Space but I only have 2 crews. Would it be possible to play at 3 by having 2 players control one crew while the other controls the other? Are there any other alternatives for three players aside from buying another crew? We&#39;d like to test the game before buying anything else, if possible. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Karrion42"> /u/Karrion42 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1gq2b4w/core_space_with_3_players/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1gq2b4w/core_space_with_3_players/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi there, I&#39;m looking for a great spy themed game. I think the most popular title with this theme might be Codenames and while I like the idea of uncovering agents or whatever, I don&#39;t really like the idea of doing it through just guessing words. Is there something a bit more complex/interesting? Something with more meat to the bones? Recently I saw a game called Mind MGMT which seems pretty cool. What are you favorite spy-themed games?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ThunderCanyon"> /u/ThunderCanyon </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1gq202k/favorite_spythemed_games/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1gq202k/favorite_spythemed_games/">[comments]</a></span>

## Board game standards/voting when it comes to a “re-do”:

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Part 1: Which standards are fair, and you would play with? PLAYER 1: If a new player makes a mistake, and it don’t drastically effect the game, let them have a re-do. But if you do, everyone gets a re-do. PLAYER 2: If a player makes a mistake, and no one else has played/moved or any decisions have been made, they can fix the mistake. PLAYER 3: You’re the only player that can get a re-do. PLAYER 4: If it hasn’t been 1 full turn around the table (a 5 player game and you make a mistake, but catch it on the 3rd players turn) since making the mistake, you can re-do the mistake. Even if it affects other players choices that have already gone. PLAYER 5: No standard.</p> <p>Part 2: Which way of voting seems fair. It doesn’t matter what standard you choose, this is how you vote? PLAYER 1: If you meet the standard they vote yes, if you fail the standard they abstain. They never vote no. PLAYER 2: If you meet the standard they vote yes, if you fail the standard

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Every time we play, the winner is whoever permanently removes cards from their deck the most in the early game by repeatedly visiting base camps. My group considers it to be basically &quot;solved&quot;. It is conceptually very cool, but the winner is always clear from around the second or third map tile.</p> <p>I feel like we are missing something about the strategy or rules, because this game seems to be widely loved, and barely anyone talks about this problem my group has. We have played without caves many times and played with caves once, but incorrectly (we thought you couldn&#39;t visit a cave if you started your turn next to a cave).</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/TheVitrifier"> /u/TheVitrifier </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1gq09tn/quest_for_el_dorado_what_are_we_missing/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/c
