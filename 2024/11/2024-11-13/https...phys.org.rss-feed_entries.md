Seaweed also contains many other important nutrients, and is grown without needing to be watered, fertilized or sprayed with insecticides. However, the proteins are often tightly bound, and their full potential has not yet been realized on our plates.

Planktonic foraminifera are single-celled organisms living in seawater, many of which carry a calcium carbonate shell. In tropical regions, the changing environmental conditions could trigger further extinctions, impacting marine ecosystems and the ocean's carbon storage capacity.

Compared to the great apes, humans have an exceptionally long childhood, during which parents, grandparents and other adults contribute to their physical and cognitive development. This is a key developmental period for acquiring all the cognitive skills needed in the complex social environment of a human group. The current consensus is that the very long growth of modern humans has evolved as a consequence of the increase in brain volume, since such an organ requires significant energy resources to grow.

Understanding how both environmental conditions and genetic makeup affect crops is essential to developing varieties that are more resilient and productive. But the intricate interplay between weather and genes is difficult to untangle, in part because plants with the same genotype can respond in different ways to varying conditions. That dynamic is called phenotypic plasticity, and it's the main research interest of Jianming Yu, an agronomy professor at Iowa State University.

When complex multicellular organisms grow and develop, their tissues must undergo remodeling. As new cells begin to proliferate, old cells must be removed to make room and maintain tissue balance and function. One example of this is in the Drosophila (fruit fly) abdominal epithelium during metamorphosis, where larval epidermal cells (LECs) are replaced by histoblasts, which are the precursors of the adult cells.
