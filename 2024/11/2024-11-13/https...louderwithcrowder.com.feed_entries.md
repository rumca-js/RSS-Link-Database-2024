"Controversial" in the sense that he isn't a career bureaucrat and is ONLY a decorated Yale and Harvard-educated twenty-year combat veteran who is the CEO of a Veterans advocacy organization. Oh, and he is (or was) a host on Fox News. That's where the "controversy" comes in for CNN. Who, if they didn't watch Fox News and complain about it, wouldn't have much else to talk about.</p><p>Scott Jennings was NOT having any of it. The lone voice of sanity on "the most trusted name in news" drew comparisons to Joe Biden's "expert" pick.
