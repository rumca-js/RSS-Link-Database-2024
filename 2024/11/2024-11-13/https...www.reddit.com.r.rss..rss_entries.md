## For people using Feedbro, I'd like to “hide” some folders, so that feeds from these folders don't show up in the notfication counter in the firefox bar.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Is this possible?</p> <p>I think the integration of feedbro in firefox is very good, also for knowing right from the taskbar how many new feeds have arrived, but there are some feed folders that I&#39;d like to check only once a week or when I feel like it, and then not have the &#39;fomo of absolutely having to check all the new articles right now&quot;! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/mnemonickus"> /u/mnemonickus </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1gqnd2u/for_people_using_feedbro_id_like_to_hide_some/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1gqnd2u/for_people_using_feedbro_id_like_to_hide_some/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Years ago, I was using RSS in a more manual fashion. Lately I am using netnewswire, which is great, and usually fully automated, but lots of sites, for example, <a href="https://www.mollywhite.net/feed">https://www.mollywhite.net/feed</a> generate an error (same as subject line) when i try to ‘automagically’ load it.</p> <p>If I download the rss for the site, its not clear to me how to add it to netnewswire - import subscriptions doesn’t work, and there is not obvious other means to do this. </p> <p>These sites do work on a different app (NewsBlur) but some of the other aspects of that app dont appeal, and i was enjoying NetNewsWire. </p> <p>How can i get feeds from these sites on to this app? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Extra_Negotiation"> /u/Extra_Negotiation </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1gq3nys/netnewswire_the_feed_couldnt_be_found_and_cant_be/">[link]</
