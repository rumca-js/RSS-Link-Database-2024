<p>Alright, deal hunters. You’ve been waiting for an affordable OLED monitor for a year, maybe two. And that day is finally here, if you’re willing to be somewhat flexible with that word “affordable.”</p>



<p>OLED gaming monitors aren’t cheap, but Amazon is selling a 27-inch OLED monitor with a 2560×1440 resolution, a speedy 240Hz refresh rate, and a USB-C video input <a href="https://www.amazon.com/INNOCN-Monitor-Connectivity-Speakers-Adjustable/dp/B0CMSVLJW2/">for just $430 right now</a>. That’s hundreds less than any comparable OLED display on the market.</p>



<p>If you’re bracing for the other shoe to drop, here it is: the brand is Innocn. That’s a white-label seller who takes generic hardware designs, slaps its own logo on them, and ships them out at low prices. Without seeing any expert reviews, I don’t want to guess at the quality (or lack thereof

<p>Google Chrome remains the biggest and baddest browser around, and Microsoft has been struggling to claw out more market share in the browser space with its Chromium-based Edge.</p>



<p>That’s why the company has attempted several underhanded tactics over the years, like <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1807165/microsoft-is-pushing-edge-with-dirty-tricks-again.html">forcing links to open in Edge</a> and ignoring user settings for default browsers. And earlier this year, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2223228/microsoft-edge-is-stealing-chrome-tabs-for-some-users.html">Edge was caught “stealing” tabs from Chrome</a>, purportedly due to a data import bug.</p>



<p>Well, it seems Microsoft is up to no good again, this time with an Edge update that causes the browser to automatically start up with the PC and prompt the user to import data f

<p>It’s raining money, at least if you’re selling graphics cards. According to recent industry research, the market for graphics processing units is set to hit about $100 billion in 2024. It’s a massive shift in a market segment that was already growing quite quickly.</p>



<p>But don’t get too excited, gamers. We aren’t the ones buying. Almost all of that growth is driven by an explosion in AI infrastructure, according to Jon Peddie Research in <a href="https://www.jonpeddie.com/news/summary-report-on-the-worldwide-total-gpu-market/#:~:text=The%20global%20GPU%20market%20is%20worth%20almost%20%24100%20billion.&text=TIBURON%2C%20CA%20(November%2012%2C,exceed%20%2498.5%20billion%20in%202024.">a new market report</a>, which confirms that Nvidia is reaping most of the benefit in this change.</p>

<p>If you need extra storage space for your files, and if those files are frequently being moved between devices, then you’d do well with an ultra-fast portable SSD like the Samsung T9.</p>



<p>Right now, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Portable-Professionals-MU-PG4T0B-AM/dp/B0CHFS9K14/">Samsung T9 (2TB model) is on sale for $195.76 on Amazon</a>, a big drop from its original $300 MSRP. That’s an incredible price for a drive that performs this well.</p>



<p>The T9 has blazing-fast file transfers at speeds of up to 2,000MB/s, which makes it ideal for moving large files. Since it’s compatible with a wide range of devices, from computers to cameras to gaming consoles to smartphones, this portable SSD is highly versatile.</p>



<p>And since it’s super compact — barely larger than a credit card and only 0.55 inches thick — it’ll fit into your poc

<p>Running late to a Microsoft Teams meeting can land you seriously out of sync with your colleagues and the latest updates from work. A coworker is resigning, you’re about to get a promotion, the company is being liquidated — these are just some of the real-life bombshells that could have been dropped while you were waiting for your morning coffee order to arrive.</p>



<p>You could spend the whole rest of the meeting interrupting your colleagues to find out what juicy tidbits you missed, but doing that isn’t going to win you any fans. A better option is to just use Copilot to recap what happened in your absence.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="a-few-things-first">A few things first…</h3>



<p>For Copilot recap to work in Teams you’ll need to have a current license for Microsoft 365 and Copilot. If you have those things and can’t see Copilot at th

<p>As a tech writer, I’ve seen a lot of theoretical gadgets come and go — or perhaps more accurately, never actually exist and then… continue to not exist. While it’s true that tech companies are constantly iterating, experimenting, and telling their patent lawyers to <a href="https://www.techadvisor.com/article/2517835/samsung-patents-triple-screen-folding-phone.html">draw up scribbles</a>, nerds like us also have a bad habit of letting our imaginations run wild.</p>



<p>Case in point: the Xbox handheld. Rumors of some kind of Microsoft-made competitor to the Game Boy have been floating around since the original Xbox launched more than 20 years ago. And for even longer, anyone who tries to step up to Nintendo on its stomping ground — including Sega, Sony, and Nokia — gets, well, stomped.</p>



<p>So why is it we’re still hearing rumblings about a new Xbo

<p>November’s Patch Tuesday has finally come, and with it Microsoft has eliminated 89 security vulnerabilities across Windows and other Microsoft apps and services. Four of those vulnerabilities are classified as “critical” and all but one of the remaining vulnerabilities are “high risk.”</p>



<p>According to Microsoft, two Windows vulnerabilities were already being exploited in the wild, with a total of six zero-day security flaws fixed in this patch. As of now, even without December, 2024 is already the year with the second most vulnerabilities patched.</p>



<p>Microsoft doesn’t offer any details on these vulnerabilities in the <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Security Update Guide</a>, but fortunately Dustin Childs covers it all in a much clearer way on the <a href="https://www.thezdi.com/blo

<p>I’ve always taken it for granted that the files I have in Windows 11 folders just become a big, jumbled mess after a while — not to mention being a total nightmare for finding something specific.</p>



<p>Sure, I know I can apply one level of sorting to my files, differentiating them by type, date modified, or size in Windows File Explorer, but to be honest when I do that I have just as hard a time finding what I need. The fix? An extra level of sorting!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-do-you-do-it">How do you do it?</h3>



<p>Getting an extra level of order into your folders is super easy really. All you have to do is Shift-click on the File Explorer category you want your files to be sorted by after you make the first column sort, and they’ll appear with that extra tier of information.</p>



<p>To demonstrate this, I’ve put together a fol

<p>The next generation of Wi-Fi, Wi-Fi 8, is currently being developed behind closed doors. This time, the emphasis <em>isn’t</em> on pure speed, but instead on improving the user experience.</p>



<p>Wi-Fi 8, known right now as IEEE 802.11bn Ultra High Reliability, still remains years away. Wireless technology is in a constant state of improvement: Each progression in the evolution of Wi-Fi takes several years to discuss, approve, and then deploy. Wi-Fi 7, the “current” standard, hasn’t even been formally ratified quite yet.</p>



<p>But that’s not stopping the development of Wi-Fi 8 behind the scenes, and we already know some details. MediaTek’s Filogic wireless division has released some of what you can expect, with the caveat that final details won’t be nailed down until the final specification is released around Sept. 2028.</p>

<p>When I take a step back and look at my own AI chatbot use, that’s what I’m predominantly doing with it: educating myself. Sure, I’m learning new skills and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2485764/real-uses-for-chatgpt-that-improved-my-life.html">finding answers to questions when my kids stump me</a>, but ultimately what I’m doing when I play around with the likes of ChatGPT Plus and Copilot Pro is learning how to use AI, period.</p>
