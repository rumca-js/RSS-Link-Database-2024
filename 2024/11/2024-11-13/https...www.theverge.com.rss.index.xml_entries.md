  <p id="KE3LkZ">The first season of <em>Silo</em> ended on a truly great cliffhanger. The Apple TV Plus series, an adaptation of Hugh Howey’s trilogy of postapocalyptic novels, tells the story of the remnants of humanity, who live deep underground in silos designed to protect them from a poisoned planet. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23711259/silo-review-season-1-apple-tv-plus">Season 1 had the feeling of a small-town mystery</a>, as mechanic-turned-sheriff Juliette (Rebecca Ferguson) stumbled upon a secret that completely upended her worldview. Her quest to uncover that mystery ultimately led her outside of the silo’s protective walls, which is right where the season en

  <p id="lcSf3o">The Tesla Cybertruck was recalled for the sixth time this year — and the fix won’t involve an easy software update. </p>
<p id="pHgr12"><a href="https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2024/RCLRPT-24V832-7628.PDF">Tesla voluntarily issued a recall</a> for approximately 2,431 Cybertrucks manufactured between November 6, 2023 and July 30, 2024. The issue is related to something called the metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors, or MOSFET, in which the inverter has the potential to stop creating torque, resulting in a loss of propulsion for the truck. </p>
