<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’m considering starting an open source project aimed at creating a flexible, easy-to-use IoT automation platform in the JavaScript ecosystem. While there are two popular automation platforms—OpenHAB (Java-based) and Home Assistant (Python-based)—I believe there’s a strong opportunity for a similar tool built around JavaScript, given its large community and ecosystem.</p> <p>The vision is to develop a platform similar to Home Assistant, but focused on automating a wide variety of environments, such as farms, homes, greenhouses, and gardens. Here’s a quick overview of the project scope and goals:</p> <p>Technology Stack: The backend will be built with Node.js, while the frontend will be developed in React.
