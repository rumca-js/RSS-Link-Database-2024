While the randomness of gadgets and rare weapons can be an annoyance, especially when trying to complete certain challenges, it\u2019s cute that the use-what-you-can-find nature of Horizon has been embraced. There are also plenty of customization options for your characters and the hub town, which was enjoyable as I strived to make Mother's Heart my own. Couple that with visually impressive levels full of excellent music but disappointingly predictable level design and a lack of extras and I ultimately found myself having fun with LEGO Horizon Adventures even if I was left wanting more.\n\n#LegoHorizonAdventures ", "id": 1508794, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrJ_mWZeDNQ", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 149, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/SrJ_mWZeDNQ/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "LEGO Horizon Adventures Review", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-11-13T17:00:17+00:00", "description": "An unrivaled and highly elusive lone assassin, the\u00a0Jackal\u00a0(Eddie Redmayne), makes his living carrying out hits for the highest fee.
