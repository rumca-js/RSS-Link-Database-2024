It took us 3 years to build the PS5 Killer and now we’re conspiring to murder the Pro in less than a week. It can’t be that hard, right? That $200 price bump EVERYONE is angry about gives us A LOT of extra budget when it comes to assembling our brand new PS5 PRO KILLER… Better GPU? What about a new Platform for our Ram and CPU?
