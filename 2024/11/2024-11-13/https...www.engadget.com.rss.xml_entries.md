<p>Bluesky may still be the underdog in the race for alternatives to X, but the once Twitter-affiliated service is gaining momentum.

These are mandatory meetings where an employer shares its stance on unionization.</p>
<p>“Ensuring that workers can make a truly free choice about whether they want union representation is one of the fundamental goals of the National Labor Relations Act. Captive audience meetings—which give employers near-unfettered freedom to force their message about unionization on workers under threat of discipline or discharge—undermine this important goal,” Chairman Lauren McFerran said of the ruling. “Today’s decision b

<p>Blizzard pulled off a rare surprise today by shadow launching remasters of the original <em>Warcraft </em>and its sequel to commemorate the franchise’s 30th anniversary. These updates of the hit RTS games are available right now and look to merge retro goodness with some modern sensibilities.</p>
<p>The remasters feature “brand new, hand-drawn visuals that capture the original art style from each game.” Players will be able to swap between the original graphics and the remastered versions in real time. If the trailer is anything to go by, the games look purdy. The simple animations match the vibe of the two games nicely.</p>

<p>Google is conducting a “test” that will omit results from EU-based news publishers.

<p>AMD has confirmed it’s laying off roughly four percent of its global workforce, <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/13/amd-lays-off-4-of-its-workforce/">according to reports by <em>TechCrunch</em></a> and others. It’s not entirely clear how many people will be impacted by this move, or which divisions the laid off employees will be pulled from.</p>
<p>We can, however, do some math. The company had around 26,000 employees last year, <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://ir.amd.com/sec-filings/content/0000002488-24-000012/0000002488-24-000012.pdf">according to an annual filing by AMD</a>. Four percent of 26,000 comes out to just over 1,000 people. That’s a lot.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>So that leads us to why. You already know the answer. It’s a bunch of corporate gobbledygook. “As a part of aligning our resources with our largest growth opportunities, we are taking a number of targeted steps,” <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="ht

<p>This is Lightfoot, a solar scooter conceived by San Francisco-based R&amp;D outfit Otherlab that, it claims, will be available to buy in the US from January. The most eye-catching feature are the two side panels covered in solar cells that will hopefully keep you from needing a charger. In the gap between the two, however, is a fairly capacious cargo compartment with almost 1.6 cubic feet of space. That should be more than enough to haul your gear to and from work, or to pick up some groceries when you’re out and about. The padded seat and footplates, too, are designed to carry the rider and an additional passenger when required, too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Specs-wise, there’s a pair of 750W brushless DC motors with a top speed of 20 miles per hour, generating 90Nm of peak torque, which should hopefully be enough to scale the hills around SF (and wherever you are). They’re wired up to a 1.1kWh battery that the company promises will deliver a range of 37 miles on a single charge. The two 120

<p>According to the statement, X has become rife with “far-right conspiracy theories and racism” and is simply not worth sinking more resources into. The newspaper would rather spend its time and energy on less &quot;toxic&quot; platforms. Additionally, <em>The Guardian</em> cites Elon Musk as a major reason for moving away, since the results of the recent US presidential election have allegedly shown how Musk &quot;has been able to use its influence to shape political discourse.&quot; Ess

<p>Obviously, the hook here is that the Core is a one-and-done purchase with no recurring subscription costs. It still comes with an attached display, which lets users “row through stunning destinations.” All told, this machine offers access to 30 self-paced rows through these exotic locales.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>Wouldn&#39;t it be nice if you could go out for a run without fear of being harmed? Technology has a way of making us both safer and at greater risk while out and about, but a new tool from Strava might help with the former. Strava has announced Night Heatmaps, a feature that shows which areas have more activity — or &quot;heat&quot; — between sunset and sunrise. Yes, Heatmaps is the feature that accidentally <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-03-13-after-exposing-secret-military-bases-strava-restricts-data-visi.html">revealed the location of US military bases</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The update is a welcome one with sunset getting very early in some areas of the world, while night seems to last late into the morning. It also comes alongside a new Weekly Heatmap, which shows heat levels in an area over the last seven days. Again, this can help you know which paths will have the most people, but at all times of the day. While this added awareness is great for

JPL Director Laurie Leshin has announced in a memo addressed to employees that the reduction will affect 325 people, or about five percent of its whole workforce. Leshin explained that the lab took various measures to meet its budget allocation for the 2025 fiscal year and to minimize the adverse effects of a limited budget on its workers. In the end, though, JPL &quot;reached the difficult decision&quot; to make &quot;one further workforce reduction.&quot;</p>

The display also uses a micro-LED light source smaller than 40 micrometers, so it can apparently be stretched over 10,000 times. While this probably isn’t your next smartphone, we could see the tech in clothing, car panels and more.</p>
<p>LG Display has pushed the boundaries of screen tech for a while, revealing folding screens before foldable phones appeared, roll-up TVS before roll-up TVs went on sale and transparent displays before they appeared in fancy stores, theme parks and elsewhere. So expect to see this Bop-it of displays <em>somewhere,</em> eventually.</p>
