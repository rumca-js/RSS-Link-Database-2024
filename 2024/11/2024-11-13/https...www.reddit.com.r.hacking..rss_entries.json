While there are obvious outliers, security and public awareness has gotten much, much better and that&#39;s great. I&#39;ve been focused on web application testing and the like for the last few years, but would like to get back into the more physical side of things. What techniques are people using these days to crack Wi-Fi? Not anything like mitm, evil twins, or anything like that. I know handshake captures can still work sometimes, but I&#39;d far less prevalent than the old days. WPS is still a possibility, but usually people have wised up to leaving it on. Cracking pmkid dumps seems to be the most viable for wpa2. What methods are you, or others using that are still viable today?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/BMXnotFIX\"> /u/BMXnotFIX </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1gqk8h2/modern_wifi_a", "id": 1509298, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1gqk8h2/modern_wifi_attack_surface", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 534, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Modern WiFi attack surface?", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-11-13T03:27:41+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>im new to the IT world but currently going to school for cybersecurity, along with taking a beginner pentesting course on youtube, so i have experience but limited, so not thinking any crazy tech but things that would be helpful/engaging to practice or something simple that i can somewhat easily figure out. - preferably under $100 but no harm in letting me know about something thats a lil more costly than that. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/gamerboy716\"> /u/gamerboy716 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1gq3op1/what_are_some_goodfun_hacking_devices_to_add_to/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1gq3op1/what_are_some_goodfun_hacking_devices_to_add_to/\">[comments]</a></span>", "id": 1504564, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1gq3op1/what_are_some_goodfun_hacking_devices_to_add_to", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 534, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "what are some good/fun hacking devices to add to the xmas list?!", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-11-13T02:25:20+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I\u2019m selling some stuff on craigslist and I got this one dude talking to me through an email saying he wants what I have but can\u2019t pick it up and wants my PayPal info to pay me for it so his brother can pick it up.
