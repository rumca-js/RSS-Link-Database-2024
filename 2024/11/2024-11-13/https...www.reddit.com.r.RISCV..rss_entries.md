<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi guys, so ive been looking to get my hands on a risc v board, specifically the milk v jupiter.</p> <p>Today, i went to checkout on <a href="http://arace.tech">arace.tech</a> being super excited to finally get my hands on some sweet sweet risc v hardware but then i saw the crazy 70dollar shipping fee. I live in the czech republic and was wondering if theres any way to bring that price back except for using a shipping agent such as sugargoo.</p> <p>Thanks for any tips</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/donlikepayinresell"> /u/donlikepayinresell </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1gqkh9g/crazy_expensive_shipping_on_aracetech_milk_v/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1gqkh9g/crazy_expensive_shipping_on_aracetech_milk_v/">[comments]</a></span>
