We believe it is one of the most underrated, beautifully designed, rock solid framework out there.</p> <p>However, if we are to be honest, the history of async usage in Django wasn&#39;t very impressive. You could argue that for most products, you don\u2019t really need async. It was just an extra layer of complexity without any significant practical benefit.</p> <p>Over the last couple of years, AI use-cases have changed that perception. Many AI products have calling external APIs over the network as their bottleneck. This makes the complexity from async Python worth considering.
