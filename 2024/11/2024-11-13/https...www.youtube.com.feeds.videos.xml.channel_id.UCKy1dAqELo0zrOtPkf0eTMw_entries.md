The film also stars Rachel Brosnahan, Caitríona Balfe, Jon Bernthal, Michael Stuhlbarg, Holt McCallany, Julianne Nicholson, Adrian Martinez, and Danny Sapani.

Charlie Heller (Malek) is a brilliant, but deeply introverted decoder for the CIA working out of a basement office at headquarters in Langley whose life is turned upside down when his wife is killed in a London terrorist attack. When his supervisors refuse to take action, he takes matters into his own hands, embarking on a dangerous trek across the globe to track down those responsible, his intelligence serving as the ultimate weapon for eluding his pursuers and achieving his revenge. 

The Amateur is directed by James Hawes. The screenplay is by Ken Nolan and Gary Spinelli based on the novel by Robert Littell. The film is produced by Hutch Parker, p.g.a., Dan Wilson, p.g.a., Rami M

Years after its release, Rockstar has updated the GTA Trilogy to include some classic lighting to help bring the three titles in the bundle back to their original look. The release of Grand Theft Auto Trilogy was met with major fan backlash after iconic characters and scenes from the three remastered games released with funky character models and odd lighting choices. With this update, Rockstar has aimed to make adjustments to make Vice City, San Andreas, and Grand Theft Auto 3 look and feel how we all remember them when we first played them.

Check out our IGN LEGO Horizon Adventures review by Jada Griffin on PS5 (PlayStation 5). Also available on PC and Nintendo Switch.

LEGO Horizon Adventures reimagines Horizon Zero Dawn with a playful Lego twist, simplifying the story while keeping the heart of its key moments and characters. Combat feels great and offers plenty of difficulty options for players of all skill levels. While the randomness of gadgets and rare weapons can be an annoyance, especially when trying to complete certain challenges, it’s cute that the use-what-you-can-find nature of Horizon has been embraced. There are also plenty of customization options for your characters and the hub town, which was enjoyable as I strived to make Mother's Heart my own. Couple that with visually impressive levels full of excellent music but disappointingly predictable level design and a lack of extras and I ultimately found myself having fun with LEGO Horizon Adventures even if I was left wanting more.

Watch our Empire of the Ants review on PC by Dan Stapleton. Also available on PS5 (PlayStation 5) and Xbox Series X/S.

Empire of the Ants’s multiplayer modes have some clever ideas for how insects do battle, having you scurry around as a commander giving orders and casting buffs on your legions of bugs. Managing its deceptively small-scale battles presents some interesting challenges, and the impressive, hyper-realistic graphics are let down only by animations that grow repetitive after a few matches. What undermines it most is the lack of unit variety and multiplayer modes, which don’t include multiple bug factions or any options to play as a team or against a competent AI. Without that, it’s hard to see this game having a lot of legs.

While Empire of the Ants’s nearly photo-realistic world looks incredible at first glance, its boring and annoying real-time strategy campaign is the ant-ithesis of that. Combat missions are mostly trivially easy because the AI doesn’t seem to unders
