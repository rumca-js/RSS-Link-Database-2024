<p>The Dutchman leaves Feyenoord after a dream tenure and can emulate how Jürgen Klopp makes fans feel special</p><p>For most of Sunday, Rotterdam sat under a thick blanket of cloud, but as day ticked into evening, just as fans were streaming into De&nbsp;Kuip for Feyenoord’s penultimate home fixture of the season, the skies cleared.

When the final whistle blew, and Slot walked towards the fans to bid farewell, the PA eschewed the ear-splitting techno

She represents a dangerous current of opinion, as prevalent on parts of the radical left as on the populist right of politics. It seems to be gaining&nbsp;momentum.</p><p>As an idealistic youngster, I would have been shocked to know that in 2024 it would be necessary to return to&nbsp;the back-to-basics case, to justify the need for fundamental rights

<p>Critics might have fallen for Luca Guadagnino’s erotic tennis romp but it’s a vapid string of disappointing choices</p><p>I have spent the week and a half since seeing <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/apr/12/challengers-review-luca-guadagnino-zendaya">Challengers</a> on the brink of throwing a racquet-trashing, expletive-scattering, McEnroe-style tantrum. Is Hawkeye working? Did they not see it? How, for an exhausting Mahut-Isner length of huffing and puffing, practically every single one of the wild swings taken by Luca Guadagnino’s film missed its target and landed out by a country mile? Four-star reviews? Five-star reviews? C’mon, fellow critics. You cannot be serious.</p><p>Some points I will concede as inarguable. The film is a box-office champion. And it’s pure fire on the internet, a movie more <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/josephlongo/challengers-movie-three-tickets-please-tweets">memeable</a> than even the sainted Saltburn. There are clear generational is

<p>The two countries have been been at odds over the centuries. But could  there a better symbol of our link than this engineering coup?</p><p>The first passenger train from England to France carried Queen Elizabeth II to Calais on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/from-the-archive-blog/2019/may/01/channel-tunnel-opens-eurostar-may-1994">6 May 1994</a>. Trains carrying less exalted passengers would not set off until November of that year, and the more arresting image of English and French engineers <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uhc5_29iOAs">shaking hands beneath the sea</a> had come four<strong> </strong>years earlier. Officially, though, today is the day: the Channel tunnel is 30. It is almost too old to be going to nightclubs, and is starting to worry about its back.</p><p>Its existence remains, by any sensible standard, astonishing: a physical link between Europe and its largest island, the first since the drowning of Doggerland around 6500BCE. It wasn’t just a

<p>Martin Kanja, AKA Lord Spikeheart, covers everything from colonialism to his grandmother in music that mixes African culture with metal. He hopes to help more artists like him break through</p><p>As a teenager, Martin Kanja spent countless late nights listening to heavy metal on a local radio show. The furious riffs, shrieks, growls and distorted sounds drowned out his angst. “What drew me to the music was how it was so ‘physical’ – very present, very now – there was no space for negative thoughts or feelings,” says Kanja, who soon decided he too wanted to be a metal artist.</p><p>In 2010, when he was 19, he left his home town in Kenya’s midwestern city Nakuru for the capital, Nairobi, figuring it was his best bet for a foothold in the underground scene.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/article/2024/may/06/martin-kanja-lord-spikeheart-kenya-africa-metal-music-debut-solo-album">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘You struggled with my film? Fantastic!’ Alice Rohrwacher and her riotous new tomb-raiding tale

<p>La Chimera looks like a crime caper about looters in 1980s Italy. But it’s about way more than that. The great director, loved by everyone from Scorsese to Gerwig, talks about the dark secrets of the heart – and her debt to bees</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Alice Rohrwacher could be the European arthouse made flesh, or its distilled essence, bottled and preserved for the ages. She’s quoting Italian poets one minute and German poets the next. She’s discussing nature, civilisation and the power of collective memory. She says she makes films to shake us from our lethargy and invite us to reflect on the state of the world. It doesn’t matter whether we even like her films. Like or dislike: that’s beside the point.</p><p>Certain criticisms she takes as compliments. “For example, people will tell me, ‘I always knew that I was watching a film.’ Well, good, that’s great. I am trying to break your hypnosis. Or people will say, ‘I struggled to get into this film.’ Which is fantastic, I’m please
