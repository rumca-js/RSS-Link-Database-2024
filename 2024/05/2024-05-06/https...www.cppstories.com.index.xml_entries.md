<p><code>std::expected</code> from C++23 not only serves as an error-handling mechanism but also introduces functional programming paradigms into the language. In this blog post, we&rsquo;ll have a look at functional/monadic extensions of <code>std::expected,</code> which allow us to chain operations elegantly, handling errors at the same time. The techniques are very similar to <code>std::optional</code> extensions - see <a href="https://www.cppstories.com/2023/monadic-optional-ops-cpp23/">How to Use Monadic Operations for `std::optional` in C++23 - C++ Stories</a>.</p>
<p>Hereâ€™s a brief overview of these functional capabilities:</p>
