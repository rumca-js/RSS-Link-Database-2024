Lightning Talk: Is Polymorphism in C++ Really That Bad? - Paul Tsouchlos - CppCon 2023
https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2023

Case study of how we used polymorphism at my work to solve a problem with hardware control. I'll present what we did wrong at first, how we corrected it and the performance we can achieve for our particular application. I'll also briefly mention ways we can further improve our design.
