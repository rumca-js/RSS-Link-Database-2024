<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello everyone! </p> <p>I use Inoreader for RSS, it's one of the best overall experiences I've had reading RSS feeds. I have 2 issues with it though, the fact that it costs (not too much of a pain but would be cool to get away from another subscription), and more importantly it absolutely murders my phone's battery. </p> <p>I'm tried of waiting for them to fix battery drain and was hoping to find a good alternative I can self host. I've looked into freshrss and miniflux; both of these seem like great alternatives (I've tried freshrss and wasn't very impressed), but I'm wondering if either of these would meet the need I'm looking to fill. </p> <p>I want to update/refresh my RSS feeds server-side, on a regular interval, and be able to subscribe to the RSS server with an app to pull feeds straight from my own server. If I use an app like Feeder and just import my feeds, it takes upwards of a minute to synch each time. I'd like to keep a server constantly

Currently, I have one webapp hosted on PythonAnywhere, but as I need more webapps simultaneously hosted and require greater flexibility, I don't think PythonAnywhere is good for that scaling.</p> <p>I see that a lot of Europe companies get recommended, but as I'm in the US and mainly serving to US visitors, I presume a US server/company is better?</p> <p>Currently looking at Hostinger, but I feel like there are cheaper options.</p> <p>Minimum hardware requirements as there won't be much traffic I think.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Have any of you run your self-hosted apps on a dedicated server in the past, then later transitioned to a home server? I'm trying to understand how to get the biggest bang for your buck and it just occurred to me that a dedicated server costs way more than an upgraded home internet line with a static IP.</p> <p>Assuming your home internet had fairly quick upload speed, what would be the downsides to a home server as compared to a dedicated server plan? I'm guessing the biggest reasons are that the dedi has more robust power failsafes and perhaps less chance of burglary, and perhaps even the unmetered ethernet line on a dedi is significantly faster for egress traffic than your home internet would be.</p> <p>On the other hand, the home server could be much more powerful than the dedi for much less money. I even have an old laptop I could use that's still lightning fast compared to many cheap dedi/vps servers, and it'd cost me nothing to run but electric
