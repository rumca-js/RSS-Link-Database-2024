<p>Fortran’s return to the top 10 in <a href="https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/" rel="nofollow">Tiobe’s monthly index of language popularity</a> is being attributed to the growing importance of numerical or mathematical computing.</p><p>Fortran returned to the top 10 in the index for April 2024 and retains the 10th place in the index for May 2024. The rating for Fortran did slip a bit, from 1.47% last month to 1.24% this month. But before April, Fortran’s last appearance in the Tiobe top 10 was April 2002.</p><p>Paul Jansen, CEO of Tiobe, a provider of tools for measuring software quality, attributed Fortran’s recent rise to the language’s advantages for numerical/mathematical computing. “Despite lots of competitors in this field, Fortran has its reason for existence,” Jansen said. He noted shortcomings in the competition: Python, while the top choice, is slow; MATLAB comes with expensive licensing; C/C++, while mainstream and fast, has no native com

<p>About a decade ago, I was a CIO evaluating a technology solution and I shared our primary requirements with a prospective vendor’s rep. He demoed at least three products from the company’s portfolio. Each tool had its own user experience, development approach, and learning requirements, but all three were needed to solve our business requirements. As CIO, I recognized that different parts of my team would either need to collaborate using these different tools, or I would have to hire more advanced developers capable of mastering them all. I decided not to invest in this technology solution because of the complexities of development involved.</p><p>The concept of developer experience (DX or DevEx) was not a primary or measurable objective back then. Few business leaders were thinking about the value of improving developer satisfaction, productivity, and happiness. But leading CTOs, <a href="https://blogs.starcio.com/2022/04/digital-trailblazer-lead-
