Dr. Jordan B. Peterson sits down in person with veteran, entrepreneur, podcaster, and author, Kelsi Sheren. They discuss her upbringing, the discipline required for service, the necessity and reality of women in the armed forces, the lapse in standards at the hands of DEI, the trauma and PTSD incurred from combat, and how soldiers find solace when reintegrating with civilized life.
