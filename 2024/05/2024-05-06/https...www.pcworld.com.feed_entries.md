<p>It&rsquo;s likely that you regularly come across or work with PDF files &mdash; they&rsquo;re ubiquitous in today&rsquo;s cross-platform world. Often, you can use free software to view or comment on a PDF file. But what if you need to edit a PDF? That&rsquo;s where a PDF editor comes in.</p>

<p>Last week, the publisher and developer of co-op <em>Helldivers 2 </em>had a real &ldquo;<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2322863/helldivers-2-for-pc-demands-a-playstation-account-months-after-release.html">the peasants are revolting</a>&rdquo; situation on their hands. Sony told players that they&rsquo;d have to link their Steam accounts with PlayStation Network to continue playing the game later this month.

<p>&ldquo;Logging in without any passwords, how&rsquo;s that supposed to work?&rdquo; you may be asking yourself. After all, user names and passwords are so much a part of everyday life that it&rsquo;s hard to imagine whether it might not work without them. </p>



<p>Yes, you can log in without a password, and it&rsquo;s even more convenient, faster, and more secure than before. This time it&rsquo;s not just an advertising promise, a fundamental change is actually underway.</p>



<p>Because the status quo is downright sobering: Billions of personal accounts have been hacked worldwide. In Germany, almost one in three people have had their online accounts spied on, according to a representative survey commissioned by the consumer advice center. </p>
