  <p id="w68A8b">Microsoft is doubling down on a controversial plan to capture carbon dioxide emissions from wood-burning power plants. It announced a contract with energy company Stockholm Exergi to capture 3.33 million metric tons of carbon emissions from a biomass power plant in the Swedish capital in what is potentially the biggest deal of its kind to date — <a href="https://www.epa.gov/energy/greenhouse-gas-equivalencies-calculator#results">equivalent</a>

  <p id="GVrVIN">There’s a lot riding on Sonos’ first pair of wireless headphones; CEO Patrick Spence has said he expects the product category to be a huge revenue driver for the company. The headphones are expected to ship sometime next month, but today, we’re getting a first look at the hardware design — and we now know what they’ll be called.</p>
<p id="eWIIc6">You’re looking at the Sonos Ace headphones. These images were prematurely published by authorized Sonos parts dealer Schuurman. The main image reveals quite a few buttons on both ear cups, a toggle switch of some sort, and a premium build that seems fitting of headphones expected to be priced around $450.</p>
