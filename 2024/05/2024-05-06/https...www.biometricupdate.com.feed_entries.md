		Biometrics regulation that protects against current and future risks without imposing unnecessary limitations is possible, with the right approach, a new report from the Centre for Information Policy Leadership contends.

CIPL is a U.S.-based global policy think tank within law firm Hunton Andrews Kurth LLP. Its members and participants include many of the world’s largest companies, particularly from digital technology sectors.

The 50-page “<a href="https://www.informationpolicycentre.com/uploads/5/7/1/0/57104281/cipl_safe_and_effective_biometric_tech_april_24.pdf">Enabling Beneficial and Safe Uses of Biometric Technology Through Risk-Based Regulations</a>” sets out the organization’s position on what legislators, regulators and other policy-makers can do to get bio

		It is becoming an apparent truth that, if the biometrics tools are there, people will use them. News out of the UK underlines this, as Scotland Yard has been forced to impose a ban on use of facial recognition technology from <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/pimeyes">PimEyes</a> by Metropolitan police officers, who records show have already accessed the software thousands of times.

A <a href="https://inews.co.uk/news/met-police-accessed-facial-recognition-site-3041656">report</a> from i News says that data released under Freedom of Information (FOI) rules show that the PimEyes site, which is based in Tbilisi, Georgia, was visited from Metropolitan police computers 2,337 times.

		A U.S. government organization has quietly published guidance on the use of live facial recognition, suggesting that the technology can effectively protect people without violating their rights or privacy laws.

The OSAC (Organization of Scientific Area Committees for Forensic Science) Technical Guidance Document was published in January, and is hosted by the National Institute of Standards and Technology. “<a href="https://www.nist.gov/system/files/documents/2024/01/23/OSAC-Technical-Guidance-Document-Framework-for-Implementing-Passive-Live-Facial-Recognition-Jan-2024.pdf">Framework for Implementing Passive Live Facial Recognition</a>” is a 29-page report written by the OSAC Facial &amp; Iris Identification Subcommittee and released near the beginning o

The Directorate General of Population and Civil Registration (Dukcapil) is introducing the Digital Population Identity (IKD) smartphone application in a phased rollout.

There are already 8.8 million Indonesians with the digital ID, but currently people must be onboarded in-person at a Dukcapil office or via video call.

The new remote onboarding process will include a biometric liveness check and protection from <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202308/heres-the-newest-camera-hack-fraudsters-are-using-to-beat-facial-recognition">injection attacks</a> for its 1:1 fac

		No facial recognition for supermarkets but yes for nuclear power plants: The Netherlands’ data watchdog has published a guide explaining in which cases facial recognition can be used.

In the <a href="https://www.autoriteitpersoonsgegevens.nl/uploads/2024-05/Juridisch%20kader%20gezichtsherkenning.pdf">document</a>, the Dutch Data Protection Authority (Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens), or DPA, lays out the most common legal questions related to facial recognition technology and processing biometric data.

The agency reiterated that introducing facial recognition tech into supermarkets would be a breach of Dutch privacy laws. The issue was raised in 2020 when an unnamed Dutch grocer <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202012/dutch-grocer-thinks-loophole-ma

		UK’s communications and data privacy watchdogs are strengthening collaboration on regulating child online safety, including age assurance and other technology.

In a joint statement, Ofcom and the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) said that the two sides plan to monitor issues of common interest within internet security and data protection.

Aside from age assurance, these so-called collaboration topics include recommender systems that use algorithms to curate content, default and geolocation settings for child users as well as “proactive technology,” which includes content identification, user profiling and behavior identification technology. Other topics of collaboration include ensuring online services uphold their terms of service and fulfill duti

		The arrival of European Union’s biometric border controls has ignited fears over long queues at the UK’s border checkpoints. But Eurotunnel’s boss Yann Leriche says that the introduction of the EU Entry-Exit system (EES) will not bring significant delays.

According to the new system, which is set to be introduced in early October, British citizens will have to register their fingerprint and facial biometrics when entering the bloc. The CEO of Getlink, the operator of Eurotunnel, says journeys would take five to seven minutes longer, but Eurotunnel is investing in additional lanes and technology to make travel smooth.

Travelers "will simply [get] out of their car, spend a few minutes on their kiosks, and go back to their car and continue their journey,” Leriche <a href="h
