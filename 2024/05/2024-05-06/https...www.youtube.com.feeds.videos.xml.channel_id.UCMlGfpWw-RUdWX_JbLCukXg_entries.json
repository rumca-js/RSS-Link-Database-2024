I'll present what we did wrong at first, how we corrected it and the performance we can achieve for our particular application. I'll also briefly mention ways we can further improve our design. \n---\n\nPaul Tsouchlos\n\nI'm a C++ dev that enjoys coding outside work and writing open source libraries and applications. I've worked with C++ for ~8 years and enjoy implementing algorithms and have a great interest in AI and high performance computing. \n__\n\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com\nYouTube Channel Managed by Digital Medium Ltd: https://events.digital-medium.co.uk\n---\n\nRegistration for CppCon: https://cppcon.org/registration/\n\n#cppcon #cppprogramming #cpp", "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BujbOFNHHIY", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCMlGfpWw-RUdWX_JbLCukXg", "source_obj__id": 420, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/BujbOFNHHIY/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Lightning Talk: Is Polymorphism in C++ Really That Bad? - Paul Tsouchlos - CppCon 2023", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
