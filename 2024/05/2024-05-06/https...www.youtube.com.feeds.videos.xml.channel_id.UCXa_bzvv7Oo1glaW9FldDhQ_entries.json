After all, it launched as PAC-MAN Mega Tunnel Battle in 2020 - a Google Stadia exclusive that would subsequently go down with the platform.\n\nNow that it's back on multiple platforms, complete with cross-platform play and minor changes, it offers an altogether different battle royale approach. You now directly invade other players' mazes during matches, consuming their dots and Power Pellets, leveraging Power-ups and causing chaos. It's a novel approach that can be fun for a few hours.\n\nBandai Namco still needs to build on it, offering more content, a proper Ranked experience that makes wins and losses matter, offline options and much more. Whether PAC-MAN Mega Tunnel Battle: Chomp Champs will get that is unknown, but it's a decent experience.", "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSMW6BypJJk", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "source_obj__id": 129, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/WSMW6BypJJk/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "PAC-MAN Mega Tunnel Battle: Chomp Champs Review - The Final Verdict", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-05-06T17:30:05+00:00", "description": "An Oculus Studios first party Batman game developed for the Quest 3 by a studio as talented as Camouflaj should spark nothing but excitement, but when Batman: Arkham Shadow was recently announced, the general response was one of disappointment. \n\nWhile there\u2019s every chance that the VR game will actually turn out to be good, its announcement has served as a stark reminder for how poorly WB Games has treater the Batman: Arkham series. \n\nNot only has it\u2019s been nearly a decade since the series\u2019 last entry, the way WB Games chose to follow up on it was with the hugely disappointing live service failure Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League.
