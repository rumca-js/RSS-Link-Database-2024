<p>There will surely be some surprises, though we'll more than likely need to wait until the fall to get the full lowdown on the company's latest flagship hardware.</p>

<p>More than anything, <em>Star Wars: Episode 1 - The Phantom Menace</em> is a fascinating cultural object. It's been 25 years since I saw the film in theaters, and over a decade since I last rewatched it (in a vain attempt to help my Trekkie wife catch up to the prequels). I've had enough time to process the initial disappointment and embarrassment of introducing my wife to Jar Jar Binks. So when Disney announced it was bringing the prequel trilogy back to theaters, I was practically giddy about revisiting them to see how George Lucas's final films compared to the onslaught of Star Wars<em>&nbsp;</em>media we've experienced over the past decade. Was <em>The Phantom Menace</em> as bad as I'd remembered? Well, yes and no.</p>

A portable power bank can help keep that feeling at bay, giving your devices a quick charge no matter how far you stray from an outlet.
