Metro mayorships are artificial creations whose regional geography rarely reflects any civic identity or pride. Towns and cities should have properly elected mayors, as is common in other democracies. These regional entities were invented by Whitehall in the 2010s, supposedly to order transport and investment.

As instruments of local democracy, they are a farce.</p><p>These individuals – distinct from mayors elected for single cities – have served largely as chairs of “combined authorities”. Thus, until 2023 Liverpool had its own local mayor and a second one for its surrounding region.

<p>The actor impresses in a dialled-down performance but can’t rescue this unconvincing film about a woman whose husband has a traumatic brain-injury</p><p>Well-meaning but contrived and unconvincing, this is a British drama about how traumatic brain injuries can leave people with hidden disabilities and complex needs. In her first non-comedy role Rebel Wilson plays archaeologist Sarah, whose husband, Joe (the film’s co-director Celyn Jones), has had life-changing surgery to remove a brain tumour. Two years later he is unable to form new memories and is impulsive and disinhibited. A couple of scenes showing these behavioural changes feel a bit overdone: in one he walks up to a little kid in the street and hands him a doughnut; the boy’s mum kicks off big-time, and within seconds the whole street is filming it on smartphones.</p><p>Sarah still loves her husband, but he is not the man she married; his identity, and the things that make him him, have changed.

<p>Chelsea made hay to reignite their title hope while Manchester City ran out of steam against the Gunners</p><p>Manchester City’s second-half collapse against Arsenal seemed unthinkable at half time. City’s pressing had been relentless, forcing errors from their opponents and denying them room to breathe, let alone move. That pressure dissipated after the interval, however, with City manager Gareth Taylor blaming “a mixture of energy [levels dipping] and a dropping off to protect what you have got.” Maintaining that intensity for 90 minutes against a top rival is never going to be easy, but the issue City had was that they had not put the game to bed when they were on top in the first half and they had no plan B for when their intensity dipped. <strong>Suzanne Wrack</strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/may/06/womens-super-league-talking-points-from-the-weekends-action">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Cosmetic procedures are on the rise among younger people; I’m barely 30.

Second-wave feminists casting off their bras in the 1970s come to mind, and then ongoing judgment-filled debates around breastfeeding, and the even more fraught, and recent, hostilities around trans healthcare. Recent celebrations of female sensuality manifested in things like #freethenip, hot girl summer, widening conversations around sexual pleasure, and the body positivity movement all take breasts as a key motif, too.</p><p>But for all the girlies freeing their nips on Instagram, it’s much rarer to see them free on the street. We keep them under wraps and rarely articulate why they seem to be so contentious. The potency of breasts as symbols of things as disparate but overlapping as gender, eroticism and motherhood makes them the nexus of a wild cocktail of emot

<p>Trauma, vulnerability, dependency … like it or not, we can’t just wish them away<br /></p><p>When I was a little girl, I cried a lot. I used to wish ferociously that I was not such a crybaby. I remember the shame so well. Sitting on my bed on a Sunday evening, hot-cheeked and furious with my tears, holding on to the thought that when I was a grownup, I would never cry. I would be a strong, confident and capable woman, and I would never again feel like a sobbing little girl who doesn’t want to go to school tomorrow and just wants to stay with her mum. I hated that part of myself and I desperately wanted to get rid of it. That is what a better life meant to me back then.</p><p>Since becoming a psychotherapist, I have seen this kind of wish at play in patient after patient – and I’ve continued to see it in myself as a patient in therapy, too. It seems to be a pretty ubiquitous desire, although we are not always aware of it: this wish and even belief that if we just try hard enough, if

Smith shot it in her 20s while still in grad school at UCLA, and maybe the film does have a distinctive film-school project feel with its DIY aesthetic. But there is a captivating kind of innocence in its walking-pace narrative, its indifference to the irony and self-awareness that was fashionable in independent cinema at the time, and in the unaffected charm and guilelessness of its performances.</p><p>Toby Smith plays Pica, a girl who lives with her mother and grandmother in a chaotic house near Oakland, California, where she is enrolled in a photography class; instead of creating artistically refined studies on 35mm

Much has been written and said about the Egyptian forward, of his recent struggles, future and behaviour. But a career as storied as his requires him to put aside the noise and go again, an internal wiring that is present among only the best. Salah was electric against Tottenham, striking the bar with a cross-turned-shot and forcing a strong save from Guglielmo Vicario inside the first 10 minutes. The post was struck not long after, though the offside flag went up too, and then came the goal just 16 minutes in, masterful movement at the far post preceding a clinical header. He was present in the build-up to Liverpool’s other three goals, allowing Jürgen Klopp a gorgeous afternoon of

Well, when I asked Sebastian Coe to put it into a wider context last week, he replied: “On every metric, I think it is arguably at the top of all sporting achievements in the last 100 years.”</p><p>That is high praise indeed from someone who was himself a double Olympic champion and broke multiple world records.

His portraiture laid bare the skull beneath the skin, the beast pregnantly housed inside the human form, and all of the figures he painted – copulating men, hybrid monsters, bystanders at a crucifixion, many of them trapped in chrome cages or sadomasochistic cellars – were fractured images of himself.

<p>Marines ‘want to protect the chain of command’, she says. ‘They don’t want to protect women’</p><p>When Isabel became a trainee for the Royal Marines band, she thought she was fulfilling a childhood dream. But within a few weeks the 18-year-old found herself subject to what she describes as a sexual assault, an incident that was rapidly dismissed by her commanding officers as “high jinks” – and subsequently felt ostracised to the point where she became suicidal.</p><p>Isabel, whose name has been changed to protect her identity, eventually simply walked off the base, feeling overwhelmed and unable to continue. Though it is about a decade since the original episode and several years since she received compensation, it is only now she feels confident enough to describe what happened.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/article/2024/may/06/former-female-trainee-in-royal-marines-says-sexual-assault-was-dismissed-as-high-jinks">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘I’ve had massive highs and deep lows’: Edward Timpson on winning for the Tories and being sacked by Liz Truss

<p>Sixteen years after he entered parliament, the former minister has had enough. He talks about fighting for children, backing austerity, and his least favourite Conservative PM </p><p></p><p>“I do question whether I’m actually a politician,” Edward Timpson says. “It’s a bit late now, isn’t it?” I say. He laughs. “Yes, it’s a question I should have asked at the start.” Why does he question it? “Because … maybe I didn’t feel I was ruthless enough, not sharp-elbowed enough.”</p><p>However much he is in denial, the Conservative MP is definitely a politician, though not for much longer. He joined parliament in 2008 as member for Crewe and Nantwich after the death of Labour’s Gwyneth Dunwoody, who had represented the area for 34 years, lost his seat by 48 votes after three recounts in 2017, and returned to parliament in 2019 representing the neighbouring seat of Eddisbury. Now a boyish 50, he’s had enough, and is standing down at the next election.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com

<p>They were seen as heroes and martyrs who defied the Nazis. But a new show in Weimar reveals horrifying details about some Bauhauslers, one of whom designed the crematoriums at Auschwitz</p><p>If the day of Otti Berger’s death is not known, its place and cause are. In April 1944, Berger – part deaf, Jewish, a communist – was arrested in her home town of Zmajevac, in German-occupied Yugoslavia. On 29 May, she was put on a transport to Auschwitz. After that, nothing.</p><p>Of the eight Bauhaus students to die at Auschwitz – half the number murdered in other camps and ghettoes – Berger was the best known.

She had come to Dessau – the iteration of the school most of us think of as <em>the </em>Bauhaus – in 1927, when she was 28. That same year, belatedly, the school had opened a department of architecture. A few months later, a young Austrian called Fritz Ertl signed up to study at it
