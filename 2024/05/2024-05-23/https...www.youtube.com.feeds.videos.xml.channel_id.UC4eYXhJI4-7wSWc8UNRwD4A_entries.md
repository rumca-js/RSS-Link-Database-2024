When we last heard from The Staves, its members were in the kitchen of their Watford, England childhood home. Sourdough was on the table and sunlight streamed through the curtains as the folk-pop group's sisterly harmonies and banter made their Tiny Desk (home) concert feel familiar and approachable. Three years later, The Staves finally made it to the NPR Music office.

What was founded as a sister trio is now a sister duo â€” Emily Stavely-Taylor, the eldest, is taking time away from the band to focus on her family. The Staves' new album, All Now, reflects that change; on record and in this performance, Jessica and Camilla Staveley-Taylor quiet any qualms that they would be able to carry on the harmonies for which the group is known. Instead, the Tiny Desk setting perfectly illuminates the power and talent of their voices.
