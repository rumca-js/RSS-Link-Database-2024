They tell me their API doesn't support registering domains nor they have plans to add the functionality. I'm looking for a platform that would offer me a JSON-based REST API so I can register domains, manage zones, records, and so on, nothing fancy. Custom billing support would be nice but not mandatory, I can do the math and bill my clients myself if necessary, excepting for registering and hosting the dns zones, I don't need any other kind of hosting, that I'll provide myself. I'm excluding Namecheap from the bunch, coz did you ever take a look at their API? It's hideous. I'm in contact with DNSimple, and waiting a lifetime to hear back from Clouldflare's sales team, once their website is too complex and I don't know honestly what to buy.
