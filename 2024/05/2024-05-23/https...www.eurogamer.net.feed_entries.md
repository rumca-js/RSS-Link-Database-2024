If you're a fan of Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun's retro-inspired first-person shooting action - and you might well be given how positively it was received - you've got a fresh chunk of the stuff to look forward to in a few short weeks now that developer Auroch Digital and publisher Focus Entertainment have announced an expansion is coming on 18th June.
</p><p>
Forges of Corruption, as Boltgun's first expansion is officially known, includes a brand-new campaign spanning five new environments. Three of those have been revealed so far - the Graia Battlefields, Manufactorum, and the heretic-infested Daemonic Forge - and there's also promise of new enemies inhabiting these dangerous locales.
</p><p>
Ultramarines stepping forth into Forges of Corruption can expect to encounter the vicious Black Havok Legion, the Helbrute, and the T

## Epic Games Store's latest weekly freebie is available now and I can barley contain myself

With another week of 2024 now crossed off the calendar, Epic has delved deep into its big bag of treats to reveal the Epic Games Store's latest freebie - and this time it's Farming Simulator 22.
</p><p>
This not-quite-latest instalment in developer Giants Software's long-running agricultural sim (and I'm about to paraphrase the official blurb here seeing as I'm not much of an expert on this one) gives wannabe farmers the tools to establish their own vineyard or olive orchard in the south of France; to grow wheat, corn, potatoes, and cotton in the US Midwest, or even establish an animal farm in alpine climes. Presumably you can grow a potato in France too if you want to mix things up, but don't hold me to that.
</p><p>
Farming Simulator 22 squeezes in 400 machines and tools from over 100 real agricultural brands, alongside a

The Sims 4 is getting on a bit these days, and, as regular players will know, the whole thing - which includes over 70 bits of DLC piled onto the base game over the last 10 years - is starting to feel a bit creaky. And that's something EA has finally acknowledged, confirming it's now assembled a team specifically to tackle the 'frustrating' technical issues amassed over time.
</p><p>
EA made the proclamation in a <a href="https://x.com/TheSims/status/1793661216319308202">statement shared on social media</a>, telling the community, "We know that technical issues with The Sims 4 have interrupted your gameplay over time and we recognise that this has caused you much frustration."
</p><p>
"Today we can share that we have assembled a team to invest in the core game experience," it continued, "including tackling your reported concerns." EA

## Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 is a defining moment in the evolution of real-time graphics

I mean that in the best way and I'm fascinated by its existence - in an era where it feels as if publishers are pushing to fill their games with arguably too many features, Hellblade 2 is a tight, pure experience more so than a typical video game. The focus is so tight, in fact, that some may be put off by the lack of interactivity, but let's be clear - it's his singular focus that allows it to shine, becoming its own thing that you won't soon forget. It's a masterpiece in audio-visual design from developer Ninja Theory and an astonishing demonstration of Unreal Engine 5's core technologies.</p><p>As a story-focused game, characters and character rendering play a significant role in the presentation.

There is another date to add to your diary for next month's showcase spectacular. 
</p><p>
On Satuday 8th June, at 1am UK time, indie publisher Devolver Digital will be hosting its summer showcase, wrapping the presentation up as a 15th birthday party for its tongue-in-cheek mascot Volvy. 
</p><p>
The showcase - sorry, birthday party - will last for around 20 minutes, and feature updates, release dates and all-new reveals the company has called "exciting". While Devolver has not stated exactly what games are going to be shown, I am hopeful we will get another look at the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-artist-reveals-adorable-picture-book-project-the-plucky-squire">delightful looking Plucky Squire</a>, which is currently slated to release some time this year.

Listen carefully to the finale of last week's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> trailer, and a familiar musical theme can be heard. Originally titled 'Earth' but best known to fans of the franchise as 'Ezio's Family', you may as well at this point just call it The Assassin's Creed Series Theme. 
</p><p>
Unfortunately, when I speak to the brains behind it, veteran composer Jesper Kyd, he says he can't say more about Assassin's Creed Shadows at all - or at least, not yet. That's despite his work scoring numerous games across the franchise to date - and despite his iconic theme being used within Shadows once again. 
</p><p>
Whether he's involved more deeply in the upcoming feudal Japan-set Shadows is a closely-guarded secret, it seems. But presumably he can confirm he ha

## Atari buys Intellivision brand, ending longest running console war

Atari has purchased the Intellivision brand, ending what Atari claims to be the "longest running console war in history".
</p><p>
Atari's home consoles went head-to-head with Mattel's Intellivision in the late 1970s and 1980s, long before Nintendo and Sega competed in the 1990s. Intellivision even enlisted actor <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYLly625cXE">George Plimpton for an infamous series of adverts</a> comparing the two consoles.

</p><p>
Now Atari owns the rights to over 200 games from the Intellivision portfolio and its trademarks. However, Intellivision Entertainment will continue developing and distributing the <a href="https://intellivision.com/">Amico console</a> under a new brand and with a licence from Atari to distribute new versions of Intellivision games on that console.

Oli Welsh, gone and much-missed (he didn't die), once made an excellent point to me about the Mario RPGs. There's this brilliant running joke in some of them that I had not spotted until he mentioned it. The joke's simple: nobody recognises Mario when he first arrives in a new location. They don't recognise him up to the moment when he jumps. Jumping is Mario's thing. Jumping, the games seem to be saying, <em>is</em> Mario. Without jumping, he could be anyone.</p><p>What this joke gets at is the notion that there's this...how to phrase this? I don't think it's fair to say that there's a <em>hole</em> at the centre of the character, because lots of

For comparison, 10,500 people were laid off in 2023, meaning almost as many have been impacted so far in 2024 in less than half the time.

Blizzard is removing the Hero Mastery Gauntles PvE mode from Overwatch three months after it launched as "it hasn't resonated with players".
</p><p>
The mode will no longer be available to play from Season 11 on 18th June, after it launched in March this year. 
</p><p>
Players therefore have until then, during Season 10, to complete the Lifetime Challenges for the mode and compete on its Top 500 leaderboards.

Players of EA games such as Apex Legends, FC 24 and The Sims 4 have been greeted with warnings that their "games have been removed from your library". 
</p><p>
EA acknowledged the issue as a bug yesterday, and said that it had now been resolved. "We fixed the issue with EA services on PC. Log out and log back in to access your games. Thanks for sticking with us!" EA Help <a href="https://x.com/EAHelp/status/1793255707808268465">wrote</a> on social media platform X.
</p><p>
But users of the EA app (the PC replacement for Origin) have said the problem still remains - and Eurogamer has verified this morning that the warning message is still showing for us.

Sony has shared a video detailing the company's future plans for the next decade, including a look ahead at one possible concept for a futuristic PlayStation controller. 
</p><p>
"How far will imagination carry us?" the video asks, showing an artist's animated character coming to life before our eyes. 
</p><p>
But the controller is the video's most eye-grabbing detail, as we see it being used to pilot a character through space. The pad features a holographic screen hovering above the controller itself, and would easily look home on the Starship Enterprise. (Although many online have made unfavourable comparisons to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2018-what-was-actually-real-in-the-e3-2005-ps3-reveal">infamous PS3 boomerang concept</a>.)

Embracer's headcount has plummeted by 4532 employees over the past financial year, while 44 studios have been closed and 80 in-development projects have been dropped during this period.
