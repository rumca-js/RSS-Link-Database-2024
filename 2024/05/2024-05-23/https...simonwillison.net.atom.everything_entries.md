<blockquote cite="https://lethain.com/no-wrong-doors/"><p>The most effective mechanism I’ve found for rolling out No Wrong Door is initiating three-way conversations when asked questions. If someone direct messages me a question, then I will start a thread with the question asker, myself, and the person I believe is the correct recipient for the question. This is particularly effective because it’s a viral approach: rolling out No Wrong Door just requires any one of the three participants to adopt the approach.</p></blockquote><p class="cite">&mdash; <a href="https://lethain.com/no-wrong-doors/">Will Larson</a>
