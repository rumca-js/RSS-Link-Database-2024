There is corruption afoot, and the highest reaches of society have been infiltrated by wielders of the occult. The game puts players in the shoes of the head of a great house, and they are tasked with rooting out this corruption and saving medieval Europe in the process. \n\nThe core gameplay loop of Crown Wars: The Black Prince is simple: you kit out a small squad of your soldiers and set them out on missions. These missions are tactical in nature, and if all goes well, your soldiers can come back home with little to no casualties, and new resources, which can in turn be used to get stronger gear for tougher missions. This gameplay loop is interspersed with a story that takes too long to get going, and along the way, players will also have to deal with bland visuals and terrible audio. But at least the game is fun.", "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdiSeqBWgqY", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "source_obj__id": 129, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/GdiSeqBWgqY/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Is This Medieval-XCOM Style Game Worth Your Time?", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-05-23T13:30:09+00:00", "description": "Six years ago, Microsoft announced the acquisition of Ninja Theory, and a year later, the company unveiled Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2, positioning it at the time as a showcase title for newly revealed next-gen Xbox hardware.
