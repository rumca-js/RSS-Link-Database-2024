<p>Manchester United striker’s career of wild peaks and troughs needs a strong display at Wembley after latest England blow</p><p>Marcus Rashford’s finger-to-the-temple, eyes-closed goal celebration is a moment of contemplative stillness. Unveiled last season, it is the Manchester United forward’s version of the shush. The noise around him might be loud but it does not matter. He will cut through it with his focus and mental strength.</p><p>There was a difference when he showed it off against Manchester City in March. On that occasion, the eyes blazed and he could not&nbsp;help but scream. It was the Premier League <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/mar/03/manchester-city-united-premier-league-match-report">derby at the Etihad</a> and he&nbsp;had just scored one of the goals of his career – a rising 25-yard drive of furious power. Was it better than his Ronaldo-esque, 40-yard&nbsp;knuckleball free-kick at Chelsea in a Carabao Cup tie in 2019? Maybe.</p> <a href="https:

How do writers who’ve written zero-star reviews feel about the worst shows they’ve ever seen now?</p><p>It’s harder to write about something you love than something you hate. But what is often forgotten is that the axiom can loop back on itself.

It is under such conditions that the zero-star review is born.</p><p>The challenge is to stop it becoming a torrent of fury about the waste of your time and the talents of the people involved (or the corruption of civilisation itself, if you are dealing with a reality show, which is frequently the case). It’s best to get that out of the way in a first draft or a WhatsApp screed to a patient friend, family member or spouse. Then you can try to

Tim Steidten was not long into his job as the technical director when he went to David Sullivan, the co-owner, and suggested Julen Lopetegui as a potential replacement for David Moyes.</p><p>Contact was soon established, a video call with Sullivan last October giving Lopetegui an opportunity to develop a relationship with the key figure at the London Stadium. Moyes was already on borrowed time. Lopetegui was ready, unemployed and keen to work in the Premier League again.

## Bubble tea is expensive, sugary and, as my kids have discovered, causing tween warfare | Emma Brockes

<p>At Tea Magic in New York, I’m happy to indulge my girls and their friends in the latest soft-drink craze. Until things kick off</p><p>Last Friday, I took four nine-year-old girls to their favourite after-school hang-out, Tea Magic, a place that is distinct from, and in their view superior to, Shiny Tea, Gong Cha Tea, Coco Tea and Mochi Dulci. If you had to create in a laboratory an environment to appeal to tween girls it would be this one: on each wall, huge Hello Kitty-type murals and a menu involving combined fluorescent syrups and a range of brightly coloured add-ons loosely inspired by the tapioca “boba tea”. Within seven minutes, everyone was jacked up on sugar, including a group of girls from a rival elementary school, whereupon things briefly got exciting.</p><p>As someone who grew up in the era of Panda Cola, I’ll admit that fashion as expressed through the medium of soft drinks is something I occasionally struggle with. Fifteen years ago, I was kind of on board with iced c

<p>Companies in the oil, hotel, meat and other sectors are price-gouging the US public. They’re not hiding it, either</p><p>In 2022, the Biden administration and the oil industry were in a brutal fight over oil prices. The president was demanding that domestic oil producers invest and drill more to address spiking costs, but Texas frackers were recalcitrant. “Whether it’s $150 oil, $200 oil, or $100 oil, we’re not going to change our growth plans,” the Pioneer CEO Scott Sheffield <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-02-18/shale-wildcatters-send-bullish-oil-price-signal-with-output-restraint?sref=sBMxP0gT">said</a>, echoing comments from other leaders at different domestic firms. Profits would go to investors, not to more rigs to address pain at the pump.</p><p>The oil barons won the fight.

<p>A group of ‘attractive and confident’ virgins are heading to an island in a newly announced dating show that provokes a number of questions</p><p>Students of reality TV, take heed, for the genre has finally reached its logical endpoint. In retrospect it was always a question of when, not if, a production company would pitch a series entitled Virgin Island, but now at last the day is upon us.</p><p>According to <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/hulu-virgin-island-dating-show-1236013076/">Variety</a>, Hulu has just launched Virgin Island, a show that is exactly what you think it is.

## Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom at 40: Spielberg’s hit-and-miss relic

<p>There’s plenty to still admire in Indy’s second outing but it remains an ungainly and, at times, culturally offensive adventure</p><p>Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom begins with an action sequence that’s almost exactly 20 minutes long, starting with a show-stopping east-meets-west rendition of Anything Goes at a Shanghai nightclub in 1935 and ending in the whitewater rapids at the foot of the Himalayas. For the director Steven Spielberg, whose Raiders of the Lost Ark had instantly been canonized as an all-time great adventure movie only three years before, the only option was to top himself, to make a sequel so breathlessly paced and technically proficient that audiences would be whisked along relentlessly. At one point, it literally becomes a rollercoaster ride, with runaway cars zipping through a mine shaft like Space Mountain.</p><p>But the opening action sequence does end. And while there’s a generous array of other outstanding set pieces to come, The Temple of Doom has to
