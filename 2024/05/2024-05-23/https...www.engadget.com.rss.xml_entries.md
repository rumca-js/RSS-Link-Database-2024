<p>If you take in your Samsung device to an independent shop for repair, Samsung requires the store to send your name, contact information, device identifier, and the nature of your complaint to the mothership. Worse, if the repair store detects that your device has been previously repaired with an aftermarket or a non-Samsung part, Samsung requires the establishment to “immediately disassemble” your device and “immediately notify” the company.</p>
<p>These details were revealed thanks to <em>404 Media</em>, which <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.404media.co/samsung-requires-independent-repair-shops-to-share-customer-data-snitch-on-people-who-use-aftermarket-parts-leaked-contract-shows/">obtained</a> a contract that Samsung requires all independent repair stores to sign in exchange for selling them genuine repair parts.

<p>Starliner, the Boeing-made vehicle intended to carry the next generation of astronauts, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/starliners-first-crew-mission-gets-pushed-back-yet-again-this-time-with-no-new-launch-date-163020007.html"><ins>has had its launch scrubbed once again</ins></a>. NASA called off the maiden crewed launch after a number of key engineering faults were discovered, and has declined to announce a new test date. Until then, the two personnel expected to soar into the heavens will just have to standby and hope that engineers are able to address the flaws with the Boeing-made craft.</p>

<p>Instant Pots had a huge moment a few years ago. Promising to be an all-in-one multi-cooker that can replace gadgets like a rice cooker, slow cooker, yogurt maker and more, the Instant Pot rose to fame in part thanks to its versatility and also the fact that it’s a good electric pressure cooker. The latter is one of its biggest appeals, and it’s made the Instant Pot popular with home cooks in particular (including many of us on the Engadget staff).</p>
<p>Maybe you bought an Instant Pot at the height of the craze, or you just picked one up on discount. It can be overwhelming to decide what to do with a small appliance like this that seemingly does everything. In this guide, we’ll give you a primer on the first steps you should take when you get one, some tips and tricks on how to use it and a few favorite recipes and source links. A lot of this comes from personal experience; I've been an Instant Pot owner for a few years. I'll also note that the listed recipes reflect my own taste,

<p>OpenAI cast the actor of Sky's voice months before Sam Altman contacted Scarlett Johansson, and it had no intention of finding someone who sounded like her, according to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/05/22/openai-scarlett-johansson-chatgpt-ai-voice/"><em>The Washington Post</em></a>. The publication said the flier OpenAI issued last year looked for actors that had &quot;warm, engaging [and] charismatic&quot; voices. They needed to be between 25 and 45 years old and had to be non-union, but OpenAI reportedly didn't specify that it was looking for a Scarlett Johansson voice-alike. If you'll recall, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/scarlett-johansson-says-openai-used-her-likeness-without-permission-for-its-sky-voice-assistant-233451958.html">Johansson accused the company</a> of copying her likeness without permission for its Sky voice assistant.</p>
