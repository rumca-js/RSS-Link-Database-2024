<p>Minimal APIs in ASP.NET Core allow us to build lightweight APIs with minimal dependencies. However, often we will still need authentication and authorization in our minimal APIs. There are several ways to achieve this in ASP.NET Core including basic authentication, token-based authentication, and identity-based authentication.</p><p>We discussed implementing basic authentication in minimal APIs <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3715243/build-an-authentication-handler-for-a-minimal-api-in-aspnet-core.html">here</a>, and JWT token-based authentication in minimal APIs <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3669188/how-to-implement-jwt-authentication-in-aspnet-core.html">here</a>.

<p>Programmers frequently need to sort elements from a database into a collection, array, or map. In Java, we can implement whatever sorting algorithm we want with any type.</p><p>Using the <code>Comparable</code> interface and <code>compareTo()</code> method, we can sort using alphabetical order, <code>String</code> length, reverse alphabetical order, or numbers. The <code>Comparator</code> interface allows us to do the same but in a more flexible way.</p><p>Whatever we want to do, we just need to know how to implement the correct sort logic for the given interface and type.</p><h2>Sorting with Java's Comparable and Comparator interfaces</h2>
