I colorized, restored and created a sound design for this video of San Francisco  Late 1930s, a Subway ride, you can see what's going on outside, a view of downtown, people dancing and having fun, and a long drive through the city and over the bridge. 

Video Restoration Process:
✔ FPS boosted to 60 frames per second 
✔ Image resolution boosted up to HD 
✔ Improved video sharpness and brightness 
✔ Colorized only for the ambiance (not historically accurate)
✔added sound design only for the ambiance
✔restoration:(stabilisation,denoise,cleand,deblur)
