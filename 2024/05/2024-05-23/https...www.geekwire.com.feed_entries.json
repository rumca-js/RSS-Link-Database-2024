That&#8217;s kind of what&#8217;s happening with a new artificial intelligence system developed by University of Washington researchers in which a person wearing noise canceling headphones can &#8220;enroll&#8221; a single person into the system just by looking at them for a few seconds. The system then cancels out all other noise in the environment and plays just the enrolled speaker&#8217;s voice, even if the listener moves around and no longer&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2024/look-and-listen-ai-headphones-cancel-background-noise-and-focus-on-one-speaker-after-a-glance/\">Read More</a>", "language": "en-US", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2024/look-and-listen-ai-headphones-cancel-background-noise-and-focus-on-one-speaker-after-a-glance", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed", "source_obj__id": 131, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Look, and listen: AI headphones cancel background noise and focus on one speaker after a glance", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-05-23T18:29:51+00:00", "description": "<img alt=\"Orbital selfie of Amazon Kuipersat satellite\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"709\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/240523-kuiper1-1260x709.jpg\" width=\"1260\" /><br />After a series of successful tests, Amazon says it has begun the monthslong process of bringing two prototype satellites for its Project Kuiper broadband internet constellation down from orbit. &#8220;The last milestone in our Protoflight mission is deorbiting Kuipersat-1 and Kuipersat-2,&#8221; Amazon said today in an online update.

The Seattle-based company describes the new drone as the first in the industry designed specifically for Drone as First Responder operations, commonly known as DFR. The drone, dubbed &#8220;Responder,&#8221; is part of a system that also includes a Responder Station to house the drone, and Brinc&#8217;s LiveOps software. Brinc estimates that the drone can resolve about 25% of calls without dispatching officers.

The complaint, filed last week by nonprofit law firm Towards Justice on behalf of Seattle resident Robert White, alleges that the fees are deceptive and misleading. It also claims that the fee &#8220;bears no reasonable or logical relationship to the companies&#8217; costs.&#8221; Seattle&#8217;s minimum pay law, one of the first in the nation designed for independent contractors who deliver food, went into effect in January.
