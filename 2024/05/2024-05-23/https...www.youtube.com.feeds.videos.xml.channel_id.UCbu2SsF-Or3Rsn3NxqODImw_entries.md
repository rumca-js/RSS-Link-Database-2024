The Necrons and Mechanicum return in Mechanicus 2.

In an exciting addition for the sequel, players will not just be battling as the Adeptus Mechanicus against the awakening of a Necron tomb world, but will also be able to fight as the Necrons for the resurgence of their dynasty , with both sides now fully playable over multiple campaigns.

Strategic gameplay is again at the forefront of the action, with players able to manage their territories’ garrisons and assemble forces for each mission, choosing from a vastly expanded selection of fighters from each faction’s range. New environmental mechanics will also require players to maneuver their forces like never before and play to their chosen faction’s strengths and weaknesses – take cover behind terrain as the Mechanicus, or destroy it as the Necrons.

## MultiVersus Looks To Return With A Bang After Risky Hiatus

The Warner Bros. platform fighter is hoping its absence makes players' hearts grow fonder.

Back in May 2022, MultiVersus--a platform fighter in the vein of Super Smash Bros. featuring characters from across the Warner Bros. portfolio--burst onto the scene in open beta. Shaggy from Scooby-Doo could duke it out with Batman, Bugs Bunny could be seen throwing pies at Arya Stark, and the list of fever dream matchups only grew from there.

Now, in May 2024, the self-imposed hiatus is over: MultiVersus is coming back. We got to check out the new PvE Rifts mode, as well as run a few matches with three of the four new characters coming to the roster.

## Senua's Saga: Hellblade II GameSpot Review

Hellblade 2 is perhaps the most visually remarkable Xbox title to date, but is ultimately undermined by its emphasis on fidelity over story and gameplay.

Rather than expanding its systems and scope, or weaving a story equal parts intimate and mystical, Senua's Sage: Hellblade 2 focuses on vastly improving what its predecessor already did so well: visuals and sound. Hellblade 2 is a marvel to look at. It's gorgeous, cinematic, and hyper-realistic, yet still eerie and ethereal. Its music remains extraordinary, and its sound design is primed to make your skin crawl. And yet, I cannot help but be disappointed by how pared down and shallow its story and gameplay are. While Hellblade 2 might be a sight to behold, its minimal gameplay and muddled narrative prevent it from being a game that has any meaningful impact on me.
