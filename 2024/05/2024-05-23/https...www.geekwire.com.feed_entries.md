That&#8217;s kind of what&#8217;s happening with a new artificial intelligence system developed by University of Washington researchers in which a person wearing noise canceling headphones can &#8220;enroll&#8221; a single person into the system just by looking at them for a few seconds. The system then cancels out all other noise in the environment and plays just the enrolled speaker&#8217;s voice, even if the listener moves around and no longer&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/look-and-listen-ai-headphones-cancel-background-noise-and-focus-on-one-speaker-after-a-glance/">Read More</a>

Project Kuiper is Amazon&#8217;s $10 billion initiative to provide global high-speed internet service from low Earth orbit. The project has lagged behind SpaceX&#8217;s Starlink satellite network, which already has more than 3 million customers and is partnering with T-Mobile, But Amazon has enlisted its own high-profile set of partners, including Verizon and&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/amazon-project-kuiper-deorbit-prot

The Seattle-based company describes the new drone as the first in the industry designed specifically for Drone as First Responder operations, commonly known as DFR. The drone, dubbed &#8220;Responder,&#8221; is part of a system that also includes a Responder Station to house the drone, and Brinc&#8217;s LiveOps software. Brinc estimates that the drone can resolve about 25% of calls without dispatching officers.

The complaint, filed last week by nonprofit law firm Towards Justice on behalf of Seattle resident Robert White, alleges that the fees are deceptive and misleading. It also claims that the fee &#8220;bears no reasonable or logical relationship to the companies&#8217; costs.&#8221; Seattle&#8217;s minimum pay law, one of the first in the nation designed for independent contractors who deliver food, went into effect in January.

But what makes this &#8220;view&#8221; at MOHAI especially fun and interactive, is that it features recreations of iconic skyscrapers from all over the world, constructed in painstaking detail out of LEGO bricks. &#8220;Towers of Tomorrow with LEGO Bricks,&#8221; a new traveling exhibition, opens Saturday and is sure to impress everyone from architecture geeks to little kids (and adults) who can&#8217;t get enough of the colorful, plastic toy.

Averlon just raised $8 million in a seed round led by Seattle-based Voyager Capital, with participation from Salesforce Ventures, Outpost Ventures, and several prominent security execs. Averlon co-founders Sunil Gottumukkala and Vishal Agarwal previously led engineering teams at Salesforce, where the longtime tech leaders experienced the problem they&#8217;re now trying to solve. Software products that help companies identify security issues and vulnerabilities are better than ever. But they have also created a problem — security teams are inundated with more&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/salesforce-microsoft-vets-raise-
