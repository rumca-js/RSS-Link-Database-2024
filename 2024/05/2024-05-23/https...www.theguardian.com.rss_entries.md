So, in Siana Bangura’s new play, three west African women dealing with grief and change turn up to their local pool in Coventry for weekly swimming classes.

<p><strong>Cannes film festival</strong><br />Gilles Lelouche’s new movie aims for a Springsteenesque blue-collar energy but buckles under the weight of its own naivety</p><p>Gilles Lelouche’s new film is a giant operatic crime drama of star-crossed lovers and hurt feelings; it’s very French, but aiming for some blue-collar Springsteen energy. There are some good performances, and a very serviceable armed robbery scene. But Beating Hearts suffers from a lack of subtlety and bloat, with an increasingly insistent cry-bully sensitive-macho ethic, and a colossally inflated final section belatedly reassuring us of the film’s belief in the power and importance of love. In the end it is sentimental and naive, particularly about the legal consequences of beating your husband half to death in a phone box, however abusive he has been. And I had a strange taste in my mouth after a late scene in which the heroine, working on the checkout of a supermarket where her boyfriend is employed in the loa

<p>A meat-free barbecue feast: charred leeks with pecorino sauce and pickled oyster mushrooms, grilled hispi cabbage with a classic French sauce, and barbecued chestnut mushrooms with habanero, lemon and rocket pesto</p><p>When it comes to barbecuing, subtlety is often overlooked amid the sizzle of sausages and the char of burgers, but it takes only a light extra touch to elevate your alfresco meal into something really special. I love fire cooking, because that lick of flame turns even simple ingredients into something greater than the sum of their parts. You can take something as ordinary as a leek, say, and transform it over hot coals into a dish that is unrecognisably delicious. Of course, it also helps that you’re then covering that leek in a rich pecorino sauce, but I’m telling you, without those flames, it just wouldn’t be the same. Today’s recipes, which are all taken from our restaurant menu at the Parakeet, show there’s magic to be had in the seeming chaos of smoke-infused v

<p>The My Favorite Thing Is Monsters author returns with Book Two, which warns against the ‘monstrousness’ of social conformity</p><p>Emil Ferris had a feeling she was a monster at an early age. “I was a werewolf,” she says, quite happily. “I had fangs and I was furry.”</p><p>Karen, the little werewolf girl at the heart of Ferris’s landmark graphic novel, My Favorite Thing Is Monsters, is clearly inspired by that self-portrait. The character is drawn as an oh-so-cute creature who is vulnerable, optimistic and hirsute. Obsessed by her neighbour’s death, she embarks on an investigation that exposes the grand horrors of political history and the street-level drama of 1968 Chicago. Both strands are filtered through Karen and Ferris’s shared fascination with monstrousness. “The book is a refutation of the idea that the monster is bad,” the 62-year-old author says.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/article/2024/may/23/emil-ferris-we-cant-enter-a-future-without-our-humanity">Con

Eighteen months ago he was handed a tougher job than that of possibly any postwar holder of his office. The closest parallel was Douglas-Home’s year-long inheritance of the wreck of Macmillan’s government in 1963. Sunak confronted a second-rate cabinet, a crippled economy and a destitute public sector. It would have taken a political titan to have succeeded.

Over the years she has gradually put on weight to the point she now weighs more than me; I’m 6ft and normal weight for an athletic, active man. I’ve got mixed, conflicted feelings about it. On a physical basis I don’t like it, but she’s now started walking with a different gait and I find myself disgusted and pitying her. On a medical basis, it can’t be good long term.</strong></p><p><strong>I have mentioned it in the past and asked her to make lifestyle changes, which last three to four weeks. It’s making me feel resentful and not respected. I feel as if I shouldn’t have to ask my wife to be a reasonable weight. But I’m simultaneously avoiding the issue because I don’t want to humiliate and upset her.

It’s melodically pretty, but a bit slight; pleasant enough, but unlikely to elbow The Changingman or Broken Stones from the setlist when its author plays live. Yet A Glimpse of You still has the capacity to bring the longstanding Weller fan up short. It happens in the second verse, which appears to depict Weller settling down on a park bench to contemplate his own mortality. “Into the gardens in blooming May,” he sings, his voice sounding weathered. “I find a wooden seat where I can wait until the end of the world.”</p><p>To which the more casual listener might respond: so what?

<p>Netflix’s distasteful ‘reality’ series holds up a gilded mirror to the people making the city harder for the rest of us to live in</p><p>When I first arrived in London, seven years ago, I used to enjoy stopping outside estate agents’ offices and browsing the listings in the window.

<p>The two-way screen has people dancing, pouting and gawking.

This is a journey fraught with danger, but early in 2017 the family crossed the desert into New Mexico, where she flagged down a border patrol vehicle and claimed asylum. Keldy had a watertight case, or so she believed. But after a couple of nights in a cold holding cell, border agents informed her she would be separated from her children and deported. They dragged her away from her sons, who cried and tried to clutch her clothing. They would not be reunited for four years.</p><p>Keldy’s treatment at the hands of the Trump administration is one of dozens of stories detailed by Jonathan Blitzer in his vast and timely account of US migration policy, written in the colourful, muscular prose of a New Yorker staff wri

<p>Photographer Dafydd Jones’s new book documents the upper crust of the Big Apple in an era of gaudy excess: doggy canapes, ladies who lunched, and a ‘mob-like’ real-estate mogul</p><p>Her face is covered, but you can tell it’s Ivana Trump from her beehive. The picture was taken in 1990, at&nbsp;a&nbsp;fashion show in the gilded environs of New York hotel the Plaza. She sits alone, surrounded by empty chairs, as rapacious photographers press in from behind, while hotel security guards loom from one side. A trio of well-dressed guests appear to laugh in her direction.</p><p>The photograph is one of the highlights from a new book by Dafydd Jones. New York: High Life/Low Life features images taken between 1988 and 1999, when the Wales-born society photographer moved to the US to work for titles including Vanity Fair and the New York Observer.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/article/2024/may/23/dafydd-jones-photographs-new-york-high-life-low-life">Continue reading..

<p>Al-Ain’s clash with Yokohama is next step for promising coaches and finale for tournament before Saudi revamp</p><p>It’s hard to look past the 2005 Champions League reunion of Harry Kewell and Hernán Crespo as they meet in the second leg of the final of the Asian version on Saturday. The Argentinian scored twice in Istanbul and yet left empty-handed while Kewell famously limped off when it was all going wrong for Liverpool but still has that winner’s medal. There’s more to the game however, on and off the pitch.</p><p>Crespo and Al-Ain welcome Yokohama F Marinos and their Australian manager to the United Arab Emirates. The Japanese team have a 2-1 lead from the first leg that took place two weeks ago at the Nissan Stadium. Crespo never won a Champions League as a player but overcoming that one goal deficit would surely set him on a course back to Europe.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/may/23/kewell-and-crespos-asian-champions-league-showdown-marks-en

When the system was created in the mid-20th century, a sixth class for dead people seemed pointless. Death was known to the dead only, and life to the living only, and between the two there had been no bridge. When the definition of death changed in the late 1960s, making it possible for

So are these hornets nasty predators or just misunderstood?</p><p>Can a single insect reshape history? A queen hornet from the <em>Vespa velutina</em><em> </em>species,<em> </em>which is believed to have stowed away in Chinese pottery, could make that claim. She was shipped to the port of Bordeaux in 2004. Having already mated with multiple males, she flew off into the sunshine of south-west France and built a nest. From that single nest, up to 500 new queens emerged. For a few years, her offspring quietly prospered. By the time the authorities paid attention to this predatory yellow-legged carnivore, known as the Asian hornet, it was too late. Twenty years on, France is home to an estimated 500,000 nests, while the hornet has cruised into Spain, Portugal, Switzerland, Italy, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands –&nbsp;<a href="https://ww
