Even though it&rsquo;s only been a few months since this ginormous mini-LED monitor was released, we&rsquo;re already seeing a jaw-dropping 40 percent discount, its biggest deal so far. Instead of spending $2999.99 on it, you can get it for just $1799.99. That&rsquo;s still a good chunk of change, but not when you consider everything this model has to offer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you use the Microsoft Edge browser at work, your days of texting a screenshot of a web page to your spouse or coworker are nearly over. Microsoft is adding screenshot prevention controls to Edge.</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s all designed to prevent you from sharing screenshots with competitors, relatives, and journalists using Microsoft Edge for Business. &ldquo;Screenshot prevention policies will secure against data exfiltration in the browser by blocking the ability to take screenshots on pages labeled as sensitive or protected,&rdquo; Microsoft said.</p>



<p>Specifically, IT managers at corporations will be able to tag web pages as protected, as defined in various Microsoft policy engines in Microsoft 365, Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps, Microsoft Intune Mobile Application Management and Microsoft Purview, Microsoft said.

<p>Our PC storage drives won&rsquo;t last forever and that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s always a good idea to use backup software to keep your data safe. The best Windows backup software can keep us covered when our primary drive finally croaks.</p>



<p>While Apple&rsquo;s Time Machine provides users with an effective, set-it-and-forget-it recovery system, Microsoft users aren&rsquo;t so lucky. Instead, users are stuck deciding the best way to keep their data safe with a patchwork system of restore points, recovery discs, and file backups.&nbsp;Thankfully, a number of great third-party backup options have cropped up in recent years to help solve the woes of Windows users. </p>

<p>Microsoft Surface was the brand of devices Microsoft launched to lead the way into the PC market, showing its PC partners what could work in new categories of devices. Now it&rsquo;s evolving into a new generation, led by <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2337930/meet-the-future-of-windows-copilot-pcs-feature-practical-ai-tools.html">AI and Copilot+ laptops</a>.</p>



<p>So what does this mean for Microsoft, Surface, and the evolution of the PC? We sat down with Brett Ostrum, Microsoft&rsquo;s corporate vice president of Surface devices, this week at the Microsoft Build conference in Redmond and Seattle and asked him to explain it all. </p>



<p>This interview has been slightly modified for length and clarity. It took place on May 20, the day Microsoft launched the new Surface Pro and Laptop.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to share a personal dilemma: That is, the trend towards ultralight mice hasn&rsquo;t done me and my big hand any favors.</p>



<p>Why so? In the quest to achieve the lightest possible weight for esports players, two things have happened: A whole bunch of small, lightweight gaming mice that are just too short for my hands have flooded the market; and, the large-sized mice that do fit me are mostly made heavier than I would like and don&rsquo;t actually qualify as &ldquo;ultralight&rsquo; (so below 80 grams, or 2.8 ounces)</p>



<p>Alas, if I&rsquo;m not mistaken, there seems to be an unspoken agreement in the gaming hardware industry that big-handed players should get by with heavier gaming mice, since they&rsquo;ve obviously got bigger muscles to wield them, <em>wink wink</em>.</p>



<p>Well, I&rsquo;ve got news for everybody &mdash; that stere
