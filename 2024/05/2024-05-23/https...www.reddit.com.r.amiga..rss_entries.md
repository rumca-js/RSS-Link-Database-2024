<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’m having flashbacks of playing a game where you had to operate a robot at the start, operating a jet ski or speedboat and when dying on speedboat/jet ski the game ended with something like Dexter has lost his dexterity. I remember little else about it but would love to know the name of the actual game. One other thing I remember was there was a drawing of a robot on the inside of the cassette with numbers that was the first part of the game. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Boyceyx"> /u/Boyceyx </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1cz3uhx/dexter_has_lost_his_dexterity/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1cz3uhx/dexter_has_lost_his_dexterity/">[comments]</a></span>
