When you think about classic Disney movies you might think of Snow White, The Lion King, Little Mermaid, or any of the other timeless Disney classics.  But at one point Disney attempted to expand their reach, and almost bankrupted themselves in the process.  When The Black Cauldron was put into production, no one knew how long and expensive a project it was going to be.  When The Black Cauldron first came out, it was seen as a major failure, but over time, countless Disney fans have discovered this underrated classic for the brilliance that it is.
