In the hazy night, Xi and Putin were taking a walk, and perhaps because they had been drinking, the two looked as if they were glowing red. As they were about to part ways, Xi reached out his arms and made a hugging gesture to Putin, who was apparently caught unprepared. 1.5 seconds later, Putin responded with a warm hug. Such a scene is quite rare for CCP leaders, who generally don't go for easy hugs. Putin has met Xi 40 times before, and this was the first time they hugged. After this, the world is speculating what was discussed between Xi and Putin. What will their embrace bring to the world? We'll explore these questions in this episode.\n\nHave questions?
