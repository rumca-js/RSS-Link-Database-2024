Social media has delivered a stream of clips, almost in real time, each video seemingly more shocking than the last. As if to provide a macabre illustration of the point that traditional television has not kept up, the broadcast on Channel 4 of the Dispatches documentary Kill Zone: Inside Gaza arrived the day after smartphones lit up with footage of an attack on a refugee camp in Rafah, and a picture that might define this shameful episode in human history: against a background of tents on fire, a man holds up the body of an infant, perhaps one or two years old, perhaps younger.

<p>Small campaign pledges risk inhibiting Labour’s ability, if elected, to improve people’s lives</p><p>Sir Keir Starmer was asked on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme last Friday <a href="https://x.com/SaulStaniforth/status/1793930153581740292">whether</a>, if he achieved his goal for the UK to attain the highest sustained growth in the G7, he would readopt plans to scrap university tuition fees.

<p>All the mishaps, unforced errors, pratfalls – they only make sense if we assume the prime minister has a secret and unspoken plan up his sleeve</p><p>For a man who wants to win an election, Rishi Sunak’s first week of campaigning has been bizarre, a little bit frightening, like getting trapped in someone else’s anxiety dream. He went to the king for signoff before he told the cabinet, and presented 4 July to them as a fait accompli. Even if they had agreed with the decision, they wouldn’t have liked that, but they didn’t and they hated it. Only Oliver Dowden thought it was a good idea, which is a category of disaster all its own: “things only Oliver Dowden thinks are a good idea”.</p><p>So Sunak enters the fray alone.

<p>With new chapters in the worlds of Mad Max and Planet of the Apes out now, Guardian writers have picked their favourite big screen franchises to date</p><p>When a blockbuster franchise is seven movies in (and counting), and the consensus choice for <em>worst</em> entry was directed by John Woo, arguably the most influential action film-maker of his time, you’re looking at an uncommonly consistent series. Though the Mission: Impossible movies have cycled through many directors – one apiece for Brian De Palma, Woo, JJ Abrams and Brad Bird, before settling on Christopher McQuarrie – the first film, particularly the astounding Langley break-in sequence, established the franchise as a showcase for impeccable crafted set pieces. The plots may be an enjoyably hokey tangle of global threats and clever unmaskings, but the series’ determination to keep topping itself, leaning on the physicality of stunt work and practical effects, has provided reliable thrills for approaching three decades.

I’ve used TikTok to build a multimillion dollar business, focused on sharing interesting things I’ve learned in life and throughout my years in college.

And now, it’s happening.</p><p>Why does the US government want to ban TikTok?

Thirty cheesemakers set up stalls in two of the conference rooms that look out on to what was, from 1891 until 1975, Campo Boario, a 13-acre cattle market and trading area overlooked by a circular control tower. The cheese fair, on the other hand, was controlled from a long office table by a point-of-sale machine: €6 a ticket to taste cubes and slices of artisan cheese from all over Italy, with the option of buying them, too.</p><p>“Set out your stall” was one of my grandad’s favourite expressions, often used at night to remind us not only to lay out our school uniforms and pack our bags, but to get our thoughts ready for the next day.

But, as I found, even a day can make a difference</p><p>You might imagine that escaping from your everyday life would involve relocating to a Hebridean croft or attending a series of rejuvenating retreats. But, according to Emma Gannon’s new book project, A Year of Nothing, it could be as simple as staying at home. “I did nothing,” writes Gannon. “I stopped replying to emails. I used my savings. I slept. I borrowed a friend’s dog. I ate bananas in bed. I bought miniature plants. I read magazines. I lay down. I did nothing. It felt totally alien to me.”</p><p>For Gannon, the sabbatical was enforced after she experienced burnout, caused by chronic exhaustion from occupational stress. “All the while, I was keeping diaries,” she says. “Writing down the ‘nothingness’ of my days. I journalled all the things I noticed, the stuff I usually ignored, the people I met, the kindness of strangers, the magical co

The first, Ciné-Guerrillas: Scenes from the Labudović Reels (★★★★☆), is directly focused on the lenser’s own history; in particular a key episode when, as part of Yugoslavia’s global anti-colonialist push, he was sent to cover the unfolding Algerian war of independence.</p><p>A one-time teenage partisan with a lust for adventure, Labudović, as Tito’s envoy, enjoyed unrestricted access to the Armée de Libération Nationale (ALN).

These films tell the story</p><p>In 1999, cinemagoers flocked to watch The Talented Mr Ripley, in which Jude Law smoked cigarettes in a lazily buttoned linen shirt. The same year, they could also watch the actor getting a socket stamped into the base of his spine so he could play a video game. In David Cronenberg’s Existenz, Law’s character is fitted with a gnarly looking “UmbyCord” and hooked up to a creepy, pulsing virtual reality game “pod” that mines his nervous system for data as he plays. While plugged in, the player is unable to take stock of the “real” world outside. “You won’t be able to stop yourself, so you might as well enjoy it,” says the game’s creator, a line that feels spookily resonant today.</p><p>I am certainly not the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jan/10/magnolia-to-the-matrix-was-1999-the-greatest-year-in-modern-cinema">first</a> <a

She looks forlorn, worn-down, helpless, exhausted. A small boy stands by her side, far more upright, with rosy cheeks in drastic contrast to hers, which are ghostly pale. She’s waiting nervously for a response from an older man, who stands behind a bureau, inspecting a small canvas. Could this belong to her, or could this be by her?

<p>The Labour veteran entered the commons as one of only 21 women, then spent years fighting for a seat at the table. She discusses sexism, backlash and power as she prepares to leave parliament</p><p>‘It’s a miracle I don’t have PTSD after my early years in parliament,” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/harrietharman">Harriet Harman</a> writes to me, the week after we meet. She came in on a 1982 byelection in Peckham (now Camberwell and Peckham) when she was 32.

<p>He starred in Peep Show, Green Wing and Wonka – and his first novel won an award. Now the star is making operas with 64 homeless people. Not bad going for someone who was written off by his teachers</p><p>Paterson Joseph is, by his own admission, an unlikely opera librettist. He had turned 50 by the time he got round to going to one, and only went because he was in it, as the “crazy” voice of God in Kurt Weill and Bertolt Brecht’s Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny. “It’s not my world,” says the actor. But therein lies part of his mission: as a black Londoner written off by the school system, his life was transformed by the goldmine he discovered while truanting down at his local library.</p><p>One of his discoveries, as “a melancholy teen”, was Pushkin’s verse novel Eugene Onegin. “I remember getting it out of the library,” he says, “just because it was a small book. And I started reading this poem out loud, at night in my bedroom. And I laughed – but I was also frightened and
