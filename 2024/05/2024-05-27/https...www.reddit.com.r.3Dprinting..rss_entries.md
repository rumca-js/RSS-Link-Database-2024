With this solution applied I continued to print as always but then more problems started coming like prints not sticking to bed, 2nd layer not sticking to the 1st one (both solved now), and x axis started to make bad sound like metal scratching against something. Today I again tightened the extruder and checked the linear bearing, lubed it, everything looked good. 1st pic print came out. I rolled z screw on the table and it was perfect. Why.<

It just works so well and intuitively for me, but I feel like it will limit me in what I can design soon and I strongly dislike it being cloud based (so it could stop working at any time). But I cannot get to grips with any of the main alternatives.</p> <p>I have tried blender, but I found it quite overwhelming and I had trouble getting scaling to work like I wanted. I felt like the fact that it is not only for (phyisical) 3D modelling meant it increased confusion as well. (what can I ignore that is not relevant for modelling for example).</p> <p>I tried fusion 360, which did not have these issues for me, but still quite difficult and the whole needing an account cloud based thing was also not my favorite.</p> <p>OpenSCAD I wanted to love, because open-source, but I found it even more difficult to use.</p> <p>Any tips on something that leans more closer to Tinkercad or has an easier learning curve?</p> </div><!-- SC_
