As we continue our search for the best PC cases in 2024, we turn now to the Corsair 6500 Series ATX gaming cases. This review of the Corsair 6500X and 6500D Airflow PC cases evaluates the build quality and tests for thermals and noise levels. Our testing includes various fan configurations, like side vs. front intake, bottom mounted fans, and more. We benchmark the Corsair 6500D Airflow & 6500X vs. the Hyte Y70 Non-Touch, Antec C8, Montech King 95 Pro, Fractal Torrent, Lian Li O11D, and more. Unfortunately, Corsair's build quality and general design approach for the 6500 has really lost its way from the company's previous designs. The 6500 has several oversights, like the interaction of drive cages and back-connect motherboards (BTF, Stealth, etc.).
