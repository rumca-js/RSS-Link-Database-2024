I like streaming services, generally speaking. I appreciate the convenience of this stuff as opposed to, well, “the old ways”. But that isn’t to say it’s perfect. In fact, I think this might not be sustainable at all. Many, including myself, have talked about this, but I think the worst fears about streaming bundles are starting to come to fruition, and today, I wanted to talk about why I think you might be paying a lot more in the near future.
