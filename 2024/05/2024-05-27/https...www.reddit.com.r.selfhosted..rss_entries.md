I have 11 containers currently being reverse proxied split evenly between the two devices, as well as Plex running as a native application on the Synology. The HTTPS terminates at the proxy, I use HTTP locally, and certificates are associated with a domain name I have purchased. </p> <p>At this point, the certificate and reverse proxy management seems a little chaoti

It had plenty of problems, the most important of all were: 1. Email accounts with over 100k emails in the inbox would automatically resync, the accounts would loose the emails and start downloading them again from the server. It got to a point where this was just in a loop. 2. Email accounts would get compromised and the intruders would use the server to send spam email. </p> <p>Since then, I moved to use Exchange Online for emails.
