<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi,</p> <p>I just picked up a 512K A1000, A1080 and an A1010, the same exact setup I had back in the day. Aesthetically everything is in perfect condition, no yellowing, chips or scratches, it even came with the original manuals and floppies.</p> <p>The only problem I've detected is that both drives do not read original disks, including an original One on One floppy. Fortunately backup copies of Kickstart and Workbench were included too, and both of those work on both drives. So do a few miscellaneous disks with basic programs. I am guessing the drives are misaligned. Can someone point me to a resource to help me diagnose and fix the problem(s)?</p> <p>I am hoping to add the following upgrade:</p> <ul> <li>Acceleration, what is available for the A1000?</li> <li>Modern storage upgrade, hoping to find a Parceiro II</li> </ul> <p>What are good resources to learn more about maintaining and repairing Amigas? </p> <p>Are there any online communities to join
