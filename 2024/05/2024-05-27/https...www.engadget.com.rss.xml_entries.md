<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/square-enix/"><ins>Square Enix</ins></a> has largely kept its lips sealed about the <em>Dragon Quest 3</em> HD-2D remake since announcing it three years ago, but the publisher has now revealed which platforms it's coming to. When it eventually arrives, you'll be able to play it on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (via Steam).</p>
<p>Since Square Enix started using its distinctive HD-2D tech with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-07-12-octopath-traveler-review-switch-rpg.html"><em><ins>Octopath Traveller</ins></em></a>, the company has put it to use in a string of titles, including <a href="https://www.engadget.com/octopath-traveler-2-review-eight-different-stories-but-not-enough-connection-090045893.html"><ins>that game's sequel</ins></a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/engadget-best-games-2022-150020578.html"><em><ins>Triangle Strategy</ins></em></a><em>,</em> the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bayonetta-3-rel

## Amazon’s Fire TV Stick 4K Max is better as a retro gaming device than a streamer

<p>Here’s an open secret: Every cheap streaming stick kind of sucks. Yes, it’s great that people can access so many shows and movies with devices that cost less than $50. It’s great that the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-streaming-devices-media-players-123021395.html">best of them</a> no longer force you to suffer through constant lag and performance hiccups, too. But over time, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/from-its-start-gmail-conditioned-us-to-trade-privacy-for-free-services-120009741.html">Faustian bargain</a> we make with these things becomes increasingly obvious. We save cash upfront, then we repay our debt through a shoddy user experience.</p>

## It's a golden age of puzzle games, even for people who suck at puzzle games

<p>I’m a big fan of the British comedy game show <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-07-28-video-irl-july-2017.html"><em><ins>Taskmaster</ins></em></a>. Each season, five comedians compete against each other to complete ridiculous objectives. The competitors are often rewarded for lateral thinking, as long as they stick within each task's rules.</p>
<p>Every time I watch a player <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UgSDcHPgCc"><ins>hilariously mess up</ins></a>, I often think “well, I could do better than that.” But sit me down in front of a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/"><ins>puzzle game</ins></a> that demands adept use of logic or pushes me to think outside of the box, and l often get frustrated and give up quickly (unless I find a decent guide to help me out). That’s quite irritating, especially since we’re in a golden age of puzzle games.</p>

## Making bread by hand is hard, are breadmakers better?

<p>There’s no finer pleasure than starting the day with a slice of hot, fresh bread dripping in salted butter. Poets have waxed on about the joys of transforming so few ingredients into such a beautiful foodstuff for millennia. But unless life has been very good to you, it’s probably not often you wake up to freshly-made bread wafting from your kitchen. Are breadmakers the answer to this, the most first-world of first-world problems? And are they able to match or outdo the stuff I can make by hand?</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-french-bread-by-hand">French Bread by hand</h2>
<p>It was only when we bought our home that I decided that making bread was a skill I had to learn lest I not feel like a Proper Adult. I scoured YouTube for a tutorial and stumbled across this clip by star baker <a href="https://www.thebertinetkitchen.com/">Richard Bertinet</a>. I’ve written before about how comforting and relaxing this video is, and it’s a balm for the soul when you’re having a rough day. Bertinet made

<p><em>Bloomberg</em>’s Mark Gurman reports that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/iphone-users-may-get-ai-generated-emoji-and-more-app-customization-than-ever-with-ios-18-181215663.html">AI-generated </a>emojis may be one of the new features Apple shows off at WWDC next month. If the current emoji library weren’t overwhelming enough (let alone my increasingly growing sticker collection both on Messages and WhatsApp), Gurman writes that the company “is developing software that can create custom emojis on the fly, based on what users are texting.” Niche food emojis? Yes, please. :tunamayosandwich:</p>

<p>Memorial Day is here, and along with the holiday has come a swath of tech deals available across the internet. In addition to the typical outdoor gear we see go on sale during this time, a number of our favorite earbuds, tablets, streaming devices and other gadgets are discounted at the moment. Most of the deals we’ve curated below represented record-low prices, or the best prices we’ve seen so far all year. You’ll likely have to wait until Black Friday (or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-prime-day/">Amazon Prime Day</a> in July) to see even steeper discounts, but nevertheless, these sales are worth considering if you have tech on your shopping list.

## Pikmin Bloom has been helping me meet my outdoor walking goals for years

<p>Over the past few years, I’ve developed a peaceful little routine to make up for time spent cooped up inside working on sunny days: after I’ve closed my laptop for the day, I throw my sneakers on, open <em>Pikmin Bloom</em> on my phone, and go for a long walk to clear my head and plant virtual flowers with the 'min.</p>
<p><em>Pikmin Bloom</em> was released for Android and iOS in 2021 by <em>Pokémon Go</em> developer Niantic and Nintendo as another “go outside and touch grass” app, and I’ve been playing it pretty regularly since then. Only recently, when the app announced some special events for its <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://pikminbloom.com/en/news/may24-2halfanniversary/">2.5-year anniversary</a>, did it occur to me how long I’ve actually stuck with it. There isn’t all that much to <em>Pikmin Bloom</em>, but that’s part of the charm — it’s more of a walking buddy than a full-on game. You accumulate Pikmin, feed them nectar so they’ll grow flowers from their heads,
