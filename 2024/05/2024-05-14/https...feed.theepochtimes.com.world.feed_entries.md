This photograph shows a view of burnt cars and a burnt Renault car shop amid protests linked to a debate on a constitutional bill aimed at enlarging the electorate for upcoming elections in the overseas French territory of New Caledonia, in Noumea, on May 14, 2024. After scenes of violence of "great intensity" including burned vehicles, looted stores and clashes between demonstrators and the police, a curfew was decreed in Noumea, 17,000 kilometers from Paris, as the independentists of the overseas French territory of New Caledonia oppose a constitutional revision they fear will "further minimize the indigenous Kanak people".
