Launching on May 20th for PC, the expansion will finally arrive for World of Warcraft Classic, allowing players to once again experience the thrill of battling Deathwing, the Worldbreaker, in a bid to save Azeroth.\n\nThough Cataclysm isn't the most fondly remembered expansion due to the wholesale changes brought to WoW, it still has plenty of new content to binge. Seven new dungeons, multiple new zones (with Kalimdor and the Eastern Kingdoms undergoing radical shifts), tons of new quests, two new races, and new raids await players.\n\nThere's also the introduction of Transmog, options for character transfers, a \"streamlined' Auction House and a new dungeon difficulty system, the last two still a mystery.

They venture with the Resonators, who possess exceptional combat skills and can absorb Echoes from monsters to utilize their skills in battle. It makes the Rover a mysterious but considerable force to reckon with.\n\nSeveral aspects of Wuthering Waves mirror Genshin, but more than a few elements make it worth checking out.
