Bats, as the main predator of night-flying insects, create a selective pressure that has led many of their prey to evolve an early warning system of sorts: ears uniquely tuned to high-frequency bat echolocation. To date, scientists have found at least six orders of insects—including moths, beetles, crickets and grasshoppers—that have evolved ears capable of detecting ultrasound.

Precipitation deeply couples with nutrient cycling through its interactions with atmospheric deposition and canopy interception, which alters its own chemical properties. Throughfall and stemflow carry numerous elements into the soil, not only affecting the structure of soil microbial communities, individual plant survival, and plant community succession, but also regulating ecosystem structure and function. This constitutes a key ecological process that connects the atmosphere, phyllosphere, and rhizosphere.

Primordial black holes (PBHs) have recently received much attention in the physics community. One of the primary reasons is the potential link to dark matter. In effect, if PBHs can be proven to exist, there's a very good chance that they are what dark matter, the invisible thing that makes up 85% of the universe's mass, is made of. If proven, that would surely be a Nobel-level discovery in astrophysics.
