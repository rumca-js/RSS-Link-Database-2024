Is This Rooftop Turbine the Future of Energy… or an Old Idea? Secure your privacy with Surfshark! Enter coupon code UNDECIDED for an extra 4 months free at https://surfshark.deals/undecided A new shrouded wind turbine, the Ventum Dynamics VX175, just hit the market in February. What makes the VX175 so different is the lantern-like structure wrapped around the body: a shroud. Shrouds are anything but a novel idea. Researchers have experimented with amplifying a turbine’s power output by covering the rotor for centuries, like Erasmus Darwin’s turbine. How much of this new rooftop wind turbine is a new idea vs. a rehash of a much older one? And what kind of impact can it have on the future of energy?
