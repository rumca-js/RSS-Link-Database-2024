How to describe the emotional energy <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/may/14/spurs-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report">of this game</a>? For long periods this felt like all the things that football matches usually aren’t. Creepy. Awkward. Uptight. Even as an apparently endless second half stretched out there was a sense around the crowd of some necessary duty being discharged, football reimagined as a trip to Dignitas or a no-fault divorce.</p><p>There were still moments of drama. Tottenham played really well, and might have drawn the game if they had a sharper edge. The idea that Spurs would ever “chose” to lose to Manchester City’s annihilating title-bulldozer was always bizarre. When did choice ever have anything to do with this?

Quentin Dupieux brings the wackiness onstream with this cheerfully mischievous, unrepentantly facetious fourth-wall-badgering sketch. It’s a sprightly meta gag, a movie about a movie, or perhaps a movie about a movie about a movie – or perhaps just a movie, full stop, whose point is to claim that reality as we experience it inside and outside the cinema is unitary despite the levels of imposture and role-play we bring to it. It is all just one unbroken skein of experience like the endless dolly-track (the temporary rail that lets the camera move smoothly) that Dupieux finally shows us.</p><p>There are plenty of laugh lines, though The Second Act would be a bit thin were it not for the ri

What a seismic reckoning<br /></p><p>Not many exhibitions turn the story of Britain and its art upside down. But this huge archaeological dig into the nation’s cultural past, from 1520 to 1920, does precisely that. It retrieves so many unjustly forgotten female artists, so many neglected works, far more than can be mentioned in a review – and all without rhetoric. Instead, its wall texts are factual and informative, simply amassing a vast amount of evidence. Now we see them.</p><p>It starts with a bang.

<p>Ole Bornedal follows up his 90s suspense thriller Nightwatch and goes back to the same creepy building</p><p>Thirty years ago, just before the Dogme 95 movement raised the profile of Danish film-making, Ole Bornedal’s suspense thriller Nightwatch was what success for the country’s cinema looked like. Basically a modest but moderately clever genre exercise, it starred a young chiselled-cheeked Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, later cast as Jaime Lannister in Game of Thrones, as a student called Martin who gets a job as a nightwatchman at a municipal building that contains a morgue. Partly because of a dare by his reckless buddy Jens (Kim Bodnia, of Pusher and later Killing Eve fame), Martin ends up becoming a suspect in that most 1990s of cinematic plot devices, a string of murders of sex workers by a serial killer. The last act is all WTF-twists, blue-hued lighting and stabby strings on the soundtrack, but the cast, which also includes the always-great Sofie Grabol as Martin’s girlfriend Kal

<p>Despite the physical signs of ageing, I am determined to stay fit, keep my mind sharp, share my knowledge and embrace new adventures</p><p>Deadlines have always been a great motivator, and now a major one is looming – death. This doesn’t feel tragic; a long deep sleep would be very nice. The question is, what do I have left to do while I am still here?</p><p>I can’t deny the obvious markers of time: my face is sagging, my added weight won’t budge, I am less flexible. The real problem with youth is that we take our lovely, supple physicality for granted. Menopause won’t let me; my body is relentlessly becoming something&nbsp;else.

Tyrone Green (Harlequins) </strong>Quins have the ability to cut any team apart and the revved-up Green has been brilliant all season. Increasingly confident under the high ball and an expert in picking “killer” lines, the 26-year-old looks a player with top-level instincts, whether it be for his native South Africa or England, for whom he will qualify via residency next year.

<p>A new Netflix docuseries explores how the site that enabled married people to have affairs devolved into chaos back in 2015</p><p>In theory, the internet promised, among other things, a solution to the age-old conundrum of finding a date. If you wanted romantic partnership, maybe you’d check out eHarmony. For fun and flings, try Tinder. If you wanted to narrow down the potential pool, there were Farmers Only and Christian Mingle, among other demographic-specific sites. And if you were married and wanted to have a clandestine affair, you could make an account on Ashley Madison.</p><p>At least, that was the pitch. From its founding in 2002 until the summer of 2015, Ashley Madison, so-called for the two most popular girls names, billed itself as the premier destination for adulterers – no judgment, no risks, no strings attached other than the payments required to secure enough “credits” to talk to other users.

<p>I wouldn’t force a seven-decade-career on anyone, but when you see someone who loves what they do after that amount of time, it’s worth learning from them</p><p>Maybe the most remarkable thing about my stepfather-in-law is that he managed to find love in a swimming pool, at the age of 85, which is how I became related to him in the first place. Just the awesome amount of charm it takes to woo over the smell of chlorine, at 6am, dressed in trunks, never mind the energy; it will be baffling to those who don’t know him. That was five years ago. Now his 90th birthday is around the corner, and even though everyone has acclimatised to the energy, the charm and the swimming, it’s still a bit chastening how hard he works. I want to call it dabbling, maybe a little bit of advice to a younger colleague; but it looks much more like actual work. He’s an academic, fine, it’s reasonable for them to have a long arc. And his subject is education which, as an area of policy it pleases the governmen

This frighteningly plausible end-of-the-world scenario is probably the most convincing detail in this solidly acted but underwhelming post-apocalyptic thriller. It’s set in 2039, six years after the conk-out; in Brooklyn, one family is miraculously still alive in a bunker built by scientist and survivalist Darius (Common). He spent years planning for the end of the world; everyone thought he was a crackpot, says his teenage daughter Zora (Quvenzhané Wallis). “Too bad he wasn’t.” Handily, her mum is gardener Maya (Jennifer Hudson). So the three of them – along with Darius’s dad – keep healthy on homegrown greens.</p><p>The bunker is a fortress and whenever they step outside (to tinker with the solar panels or browse the deserted local

The pill has worked its magic, so as the man gets out of the car, he reaches for a jacket to cover the bulge in his trousers. At this point you half expect a blast of canned laughter. But this is not a sitcom from 1986, even though the script contains the same tired gags and stereotypes that should have died long ago.</p><p>A Family Affair wastes the talents of Joe Wilkinson (excellent as the weird bearded neighbour in Him &amp; Her) by giving him zero gags in his role as Edward, the guest-house owning son of the randy old man.

<p>Food writer Caroline Eden celebrates the region’s distinct - and underrated - flavours, from quince lemonade and cloudberry jam to birch syrup and blueberry soup</p><p>When I was planning a recent journey back to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/sep/17/locals-guide-to-riga-latvia-10-top-tips-biennale">Riga</a>, its food filled my thoughts more than anything else. I kept picturing the Latvian capital’s cafes, bistros and moody beer bars. Such longing was evidence, to me at least, that I was coming back to a city that knows how to feed people and with memorable flavours: smoked sprats, black pudding sausages, quince lemonade, cloudberry jam, pickled garlic, herby butters and bitter balsams tasting of liquorice.</p><p>As anticipation began to build, a question crossed my mind: why are some countries revered for their food while others are not? The cuisine of the Baltics, rich with variety and imagination, can often rival that of the nearby Nordic countries yet it is ra

<p>So many women get discouraged by memory problems and low confidence that they’d rather quit than struggle on. But awareness is growing, and workplaces can help </p><p>When Kate from Pembrokeshire started experiencing vertigo, flooding periods, exhaustion and brain fog at 51, she had no idea what was happening to her. “It was really scary,” she says, “I felt like I was losing my&nbsp;mind.” Working as the general manager of a travel company, she was surrounded by younger colleagues she didn’t feel she could confide in. She recalls sitting at her desk one day thinking, “What is my job?”</p><p>She eventually quit, feeling like she couldn’t manage any more. It wasn’t until the hot flushes began after a year that she saw a doctor. “I didn’t know I needed help until I was put on HRT and a miracle occurred – I began to feel like myself.” But it was too late to rescue her working life: she had already given up her job.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/article/2024/may/

Recently, the Irish government said the threat of deportation to Rwanda had partly fuelled a surge in arrivals entering Ireland via the land border with Northern Ireland, a route that it says now accounts for more than 80% of asylum seekers in the republic. The Irish Refugee Council and other advocacy groups have questioned the figure. On Monday a judge in Belfast ruled that large parts of the UK government’s illegal migration act should not apply in Northern Ireland because they breach human rights laws; the UK government has said it will appeal the ruling.</p><p>Today in Focus host <strong>Hannah Moore</strong> talks to <strong>Rory Carroll,</strong> the Guardian’s Ireland correspondent, about immigration policy in Ireland.
