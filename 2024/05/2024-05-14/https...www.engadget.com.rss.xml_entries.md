<p>We just wrapped up coverage on Google's I/O 2024 keynote, and we're just so tired of hearing about AI. In this bonus episode, Cherlynn and Devindra dive into the biggest I/O news: Google's intriguing Project Astra AI assistant; new models for creating video and images; and some improvements to Gemini AI. While some of the announcements seem potentially useful, it's still tough to tell if the move towards AI will actually help consumers, or if Google is just fighting to stay ahead of OpenAI.</p>

<p>The increasingly discriminatory X (Twitter) now considers the term ‚Äúcisgender‚Äù a slur. Owner Elon Musk <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1671370284102819841">posted</a> last June, to the delight of his bigoted brigade of blue-check sycophants, that ‚Äú‚Äòcis‚Äô or ‚Äòcisgender‚Äô are considered slurs on this platform.‚Äù On Tuesday, X made good on the regressive provocateur‚Äôs stance and <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://thehill.com/homenews/4061600-musk-says-cis-cisgender-considered-slurs-on-twitter/">reportedly</a> began posting an official warning that the LGBTQ-inclusive terms could result in a ban from the platform.

<p>Google just announced <a href="https://blog.google/products/android/google-ai-android-update-io-2024/">forthcoming scam detection tools</a> coming to Android phones later this year, which is a good thing as these scammers keep getting better and better at <a href="https://www.newswire.com/news/global-losses-to-scammers-exceed-1-trillion-as-1-in-4-lose-money-to-22145725">parting people from their money</a>. The toolset, revealed at Google I/O 2024, is still in the testing stages but uses AI to suss out fraudsters in the middle of a conversation.</p>
<p>You read that right. The AI will be constantly on the hunt for conversation patterns commonly associated with scams. Once detected, you‚Äôll receive a real-time alert on the phone, putting to bed any worries that the person on the other end is actually <a href="https://spectrumlocalnews.com/nc/charlotte/news/2023/07/24/scammers-disguised-as-process-servers-target-personal-info">heading over to deliver a court summons</a> or whatever.<

<p>While Google and OpenAI have been racing to win the AI crown over the past year, we've seemingly reverted away from the idea of speaking to virtual assistants. Generative AI products have typically launched with text-only inputs, and only later add the ability to search images and basic voice commands. At Google I/O today, the company showed off Gemini Live, a new mobile experience for natural conversations with its AI.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Google offered up a few potential use cases; You could have a conversation with Gemini Live to help prepare for a job interview, where it could potentially ask you relevant questions around the positions. It could also give you public speaking tips if you want to research a speech. What makes Gemini Live unique is that you'll be able to speak at your own pace, or even interrupt its responses if you'd like. Ideally, it should be more like having a conversation with a person, instead of just voicing smart assistant commands or generative AI queries.</p>

<p>The Google I/O event is here, and the company is announcing lots of great <a href="https://blog.google/products/android/google-ai-android-update-io-2024/">updates for your Android device</a>. As we heard earlier, Gemini Nano is getting multimodal support, meaning your Android will still process text but with a better understanding of other factors like sights, sounds and spoken language. Now Google has shared that the new tool is also coming to it's TalkBack feature.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/googles-latest-android-update-includes-ai-created-image-descriptions-and-animations-for-voice-messages-172522129.html">TalkBack</a> is an existing tool that reads aloud a description of an image, whether it's one you captured or from the internet. Gemini Nano's multimodal support should provide a more detailed understanding of the image. According to Google, TalkBack users encounter about 90 images each day that don't have a label.

<p>The coolest new feature wouldn‚Äôt be possible without that integration with the underlying OS. Gemini is now much better at understanding context as you control apps on the smartphone. What does this mean exactly? Once the tool officially launches as part of Android 15, you‚Äôll be able to bring up a Gemini overlay that rests on top of the app you‚Äôre using. This will allow for context-specific actions and queries.</p>

<p>Google has introduced <a href="https://www.engadget.com/googles-circle-to-search-feature-will-soon-handle-language-translation-174802558.html">another capability</a> for its Circle to Search feature at the company's annual I/O developer conference, and it's something that could help students <a href="https://blog.google/products/android/google-ai-android-update-io-2024">better understand potentially difficult class topics</a>. The feature will now be able to show them step-by-step instructions for a &quot;range of physics and math word problems.&quot; They just have to activate the feature by long-pressing the home button or navigation bar and then circling the problem that's got them stumped, though some math problems will require users to be signed up for Google's experimental Search Labs feature.</p>
<p>The company says Circle to Search's new capability was made possible by its new family of AI models called LearnLM that was specifically created and fine-tuned for learning. It's

<p>As part of its push toward adding generative AI to search, Google has introduced a new twist: video. Gemini will let you upload video that demonstrates an issue you're trying to resolve, then scour user forums and other areas of the internet to find a solution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As an example, Google's Rose Yao talked onstage at I/O 2024 about a used turntable she bought and how she couldn't get the needle to sit on the record. Yao uploaded a video showing the issue, then Gemini quickly found an explainer describing how to balance the arm on that particular make and model.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As Google starts to make its latest video-generation tools available, the company says it has a plan to ensure transparency around the origins of its increasingly realistic AI-generated clips. All video made by the company‚Äôs new Veo model in the VideoFX app will have digital watermarks thanks to Google‚Äôs SynthID system.</p>
<p>SynthID is Google‚Äôs <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://deepmind.google/technologies/synthid/">digital watermarking</a> system that started rolling out to AI-generated images <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/google-wants-an-invisible-digital-watermark-to-bring-transparency-to-ai-art-164551794.html">last year</a>.

With the new features, Google is positioning Search as more than a way to simply find websites. Instead, the company wants people to use its search engine to directly get answers and help them with planning events and brainstorming ideas.</p>
<p>‚Äú[With] generative AI, Search can do more than you ever imagined,‚Äù wrote Liz Reid, vice president and head of Google Search, in a <a href="https://blog.google/products/search/generative-ai-google-search-may-2024">blog post</a>. ‚ÄúSo you can ask whatever‚Äôs on your mind or whatever you need to get done ‚Äî from researching to planning to brainstorming ‚Äî and Google will take care of the legwork.‚Äù</p>

<p>It's all AI all the time at Google I/O! Today, Google announced its new AI media creation engines: Veo, which can produce &quot;high-quality&quot; 1080p videos; and Imagen 3, its latest text-to-image framework. Neither sound particularly revolutionary, but they're a way for Google to keep up the fight against <a href="https://www.engadget.com/openais-new-sora-model-can-generate-minute-long-videos-from-text-prompts-195717694.html">OpenAI's Sora video model </a>and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-next-dall-e-will-be-able-to-generate-results-within-chatgpt-063833672.html">Dall-E 3</a>, a tool that has practically become synonymous with AI-generated images.</p>
<p>Google claims Veo has &quot;an advanced understanding of natural language and visual semantics&quot; to create whatever video you have in mind.

<p>In a video demonstrating the prowess of its new Project Astra app, the person demonstrating asked Gemini &quot;do you remember where you saw my glasses?&quot; The AI impressively responded &quot;Yes, I do. Your glasses were on a desk near a red apple,&quot; despite said object not actually being in view when the question was asked. But these weren't your bog-standard visual aid. These glasses had a camera onboard and some sort of visual interface!</p>
<p>The tester picked up their glasses and put them on, and proceeded to ask the AI more questions about things they were looking at. Clearly, there is a camera on the device that's helping it take in the surroundings, and we were shown some sort of interface where a waveform moved to indicate it was listening. Onscreen captions appeared to reflect the answer that was being read aloud to the wearer, as well. So if we're keeping track, that's at least a microphone and speaker onboard too, along with some kind of processor and battery to

<p>Google is inserting more of its Gemini AI into many of its product and the next target in its sights is Photos. At its I/O developer conference today, the company's CEO Sundar Pichai announced a feature called Ask Photos, which is designed to help you find specific images in your gallery by talking to Gemini.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ask Photos will show up as a new tab at the bottom of your Google Photos app. It'll start rolling out to One subscribers first, starting in US English over the upcoming months. When you tap over to that panel, you'll see the Gemini star icon and a welcome message above a bar that prompts you to &quot;search or ask about Photos.&quot;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>According to Google, you can ask things like &quot;show me the best photo from each national park I've visited,&quot; which not only draws upon GPS information but also requires the AI to exercise some judgement in determining what is &quot;best.&quot; The company's VP for Photos Shimrit Be

A Castlevania chapter is on the way to <em>DbD</em>. There aren't any details yet about what that will include, but you just might get to play as Alucard or Simon Belmont in the fog. Behaviour plans to divulge more info about the Castlevania tie-up, which will arrive later this year, in August.</p>
<p>As for the Dungeons and Dragons chapter, which brings a dark fantasy element to <em>DbD</em> for the first time, Behaviour spilled the beans on that during the stream. PC players will be able to try out the chapter on the public test build today before it goes live for everyone on June 3.</p>

<p>Amazon's <em>Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power</em> was both extremely successful and extremely divisive in the LOTR fan community. (Separate question, has <em>any</em> recent adaptation or new content in a beloved franchise not been divisive? Thoughts for another time.) Lots of people whined about how Amazon should just trash the first season and start over, but clearly that was never going to happen. What is happening is that season two of <em>The Rings of Power </em>has its first trailer and an August 29 release date.</p>
<div id="1ab3bb5d17df48689391f9a22d849542"></div>
<p>I'm a pretty big Lord of the Rings fan and found season one enjoyable if not essential, but I like the looks of how things are ratcheting up here for season two. We get plenty of teases of epic battles and creepy creatures as Sauron reveals himself and begins to tighten the noose on all of Middle-earth; there are also looks at him in his "fair" form as he forges the titular Rings of Power with Celebrimbor

This StreamSaver bundle will be available to Comcast customers, according to CEO Brian Roberts.</p>
<p>While Roberts didn’t reveal how much the package will cost or what tiers of each service it will include, he said StreamSaver will offer them “at a vastly reduced price to anything available today.” According to <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/peacock-netflix-apple-tv-plus-bundle-streaming-comcast-1236002375/"><em><ins>Variety</ins></em></a>, he told attendees at MoffettNathans

Whether it’s on the deck, patio, porch or anywhere else in your <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-fall-outdoor-tech-gear-150041103.html">backyard</a>, these products are more versatile and easily stored than a permanently installed setup. All the options I’ve selected in this guide are portable, though you might need some help lugging a few of them around due to their size and weight. These pizza ovens are versatile options for aspiring pie pushers with limited space or those who want to take their skills on the road as needed. And if the great indoors is your domain, I’ve got a candidate on this list for you too. But before you make a purchase, here are a few things you’ll want to consider ahead of time.</p>

<p>Apple’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ipad-pro-2024-review-so-very-nice-and-so-very-expensive-210012937.html">new iPad Pro</a> is one of the most divisive (and thinnest) devices the company has made in years. Sure, it’s an undeniable feat of engineering and thinner than an iPod nano. Apple squeezed a new M4 chip and “tandem” OLED panel into its latest flagship tablet.</p>
<p>The new OLED enables more brightness and improved HDR performance compared to the old iPad Pro—standard screen brightness is up to 1,000 nits, compared to 600 nits for the last model. It’s so powerful and so beautiful. But this cutting-edge tech makes it more expensive than ever, putting it out of reach of most and pitting it against flagship laptops, price-wise.</p>
<p>As Nathan Ingraham explains in his review, the iPad Pro lineup has always been about showing off just how good an Apple tablet can be, but this one truly is without compromise. For the rest of us, there's the new iPad Air.</p>
