<p>As most IT people know, GPUs are in high demand and are critical for running and training <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3689973/what-is-generative-ai-artificial-intelligence-that-creates.html">generative AI</a> models. The alternative cloud sector, also known as microclouds, is experiencing a significant surge.
