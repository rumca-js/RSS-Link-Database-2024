								<p>Fans were left guessing after developer Behaviour Interactive teased a <strong>Dead By Daylight DnD</strong> crossover last week, but now we know <em>all</em> about it. An official live stream revealed DnD's Vecna as a playable Killer, two variant Survivors, a dark fantasy map, a treasure-themed game mechanic, a release date, and - best of all - a PC public test build, which the dev says you can play via Steam <em>right now</em>.</p>

								<p>The <strong>Lego Star Wars Millennium Falcon</strong> (75257) is a bit of a modern legend at this point. By the time of its possible retirement at the end of 2024, it’ll have been a mainstay of the Lego Star Wars line-up for a whopping five years. It’s been a go-to for anybody who cannot justify the mega expenditure of the UCS Millennium Falcon (75192) – one of the <a href="https://www.wargamer.com/biggest-lego-sets" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">biggest Lego sets</a> ever made – and is the sixth playset-scale Millennium Falcon Lego has released, since introducing the ship way back in 2000.</p>

								<p>MTG head designer Mark Rosewater has passed judgment on the settings released since his previous Rabiah scale article came out in 2018.

								<p>Of all the unannounced strategy game sequels, <strong>Hearts of Iron 5</strong> is the one I dream of most. Did you know that Hearts of Iron 4 was released almost eight years ago now? Time flies when you're launching naval invasions, but HOI4 truly is getting <em>old</em>, and with age come calls for a replacement. Nothing has been confirmed or hinted at (yet), but I reckon it's only a matter of time until HOI5 arrives - and I have some <em>suggestions</em>.</p>
