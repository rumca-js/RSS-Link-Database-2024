<p>Daredevil stars Charlie Cox and Vincent D'Onofrio were the first to appear in their roles in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, following the show's Netflix cancelation in 2018. And surprisingly, it might have stayed that way in Daredevil: Born Again, as Elden Henson and Deborah Ann Woll weren't originally planned to be featured. But after the show was reconceived last year, Henson and Woll agreed to reprise their roles as Matt's closest friends, Foggy Nelson and Karen Page. </p><p>"It was pretty heartbreaking when [Woll and Henson] weren‚Äôt around initially," said Cox during an appearance at Awesome Con via <a href="https://www.thepopverse.com/daredevil-born-again-charlie-cox-marvel-studios-mcu-casting-awesome-con-2024">Popverse</a>. "When we came back to filming, and they had made some changes, which you guys have probably read about and stuff, it was clear that Foggy and Karen are kind of the heartbeat of our show, and always were."</p><p>"It was really special to have them back,"

<p>In 2018, Nicolas Cage lent his voice to Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse as Spider-Man Noir, a version of Peter Parker from an alternate world in the 1930s. Now, six years later, Cage will reprise his role for Noir, a new live-action series based on Spider-Man Noir. </p><p>The series is being produced by MGM+ and Prime Video in association with Sony Pictures Television. The description of the show doesn't mention Spider-Man or Peter Parker, but it does say that "Noir tells the story of an aging and down on his luck private investigator in 1930s New York, who is forced to grapple with his past life as the city’s one and only superhero."</p><p>Into the Spider-Verse's Phil Lord, Christopher Miller, and Amy Pascal are attached to Noir as executive producers. Oren Uziel and Steve Lightfoot will be the co-showrunners, while Harry Bradbeer is set to direct the first two episodes and executive produce the series. </p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nicolas-cage-will-play-live-a

<p>Director Edgar Wright hasn't made a comic book movie since Scott Pilgrim vs. the World in 2010. But that may change in the near future, because Wright is reportedly circling the upcoming remake of Barbarella, which is based on the French sci-fi comic by Jean-Claude Forest. </p><p>Via <a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/news/barbarella-edgar-wright-sydney-sweeney-1236001156/">Variety</a>, Wright is in negotiations to direct Barbarella, but his deal has not yet been finalized. Sydney Sweeney is already lined up to play Barbarella. However, Sweeney's Anyone But You co-star, Glen Powell, will be the one starring in Wright's remake of The Running Man. That project is expected to be Wright's next movie regardless of whether he signs on for Barbarella.</p><p>Wright's previous films include Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, The World's End, Baby Driver, and Last Night in Soho. Additionally, Wright spent several years developing Ant-Man for Marvel Studios before ultimately leaving the project

<p>The game developers of X {formerly Twitter) have been purposefully introducing glitches into their games this week, just to see what would happen--and the results are hilarious. Challenged with multiplying a random value from their game files by 1,000, multiple game devs have posted varied results including giant enemies, floods of spawned items, and super-powerful attacks.</p><p>The trend was started by developer Tyler Glaiel, who is currently working on Mewgenics. Glaiel shared a GIF that showed the game with massively increased gore splatter, and then <a href="https://twitter.com/TylerGlaiel/status/1788362032699555985">challenged other</a> developers to post similar results from their own games in development.</p><div><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/1iEBQVHayV">https://t.co/1iEBQVHayV</a> <a href="https://t.co/lJusii8hIf">pic.twitter.com/lJusii8hIf</a></p>  — Tyler Glaiel (@TylerGlaiel) <a href="https://twitter.com/TylerGlaiel/
