<p>Microsoft&rsquo;s latest Windows update has fixed an earlier bug that could prevent VPNs from working properly, Microsoft said Tuesday.</p>



<p>Microsoft&rsquo;s latest release for May 2024 (<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/topic/may-14-2024-kb5037771-os-builds-22621-3593-and-22631-3593-e633ff2f-a021-4abb-bd2e-7f3687f166fe?ranMID=24542&amp;ranEAID=kXQk6*ivFEQ&amp;ranSiteID=kXQk6.ivFEQ-TgJd_D1MVqTn3IZZmWHvPg&amp;epi=kXQk6.ivFEQ-TgJd_D1MVqTn3IZZmWHvPg&amp;irgwc=1&amp;OCID=AIDcmm549zy227_aff_7593_1243925&amp;tduid=%28ir__gdohsy3swwkfdytcely6zb39lu2xduiyvxxbcwtm00%29%287593%29%281243925%29%28kXQk6.ivFEQ-TgJd_D1MVqTn3IZZmWHvPg%29%28%29&amp;xcust=2-1-2333392-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">KB5037771</a> or OS builds 22621.3593 and 22631.3593) has just one highlight: &ldquo

<p>On Tuesday, Google showed off the future of Gmail at Google I/O: the ability to question email threads and even command it to perform tasks in the background via AI agents.</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s an important evolution, one that recognizes that the reason Gmail became so popular is because email is intrinsically complex, with questions and replies and attachments all over the place. Google is using its <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2230933/google-bard-ai-is-officially-gemini-unofficially-irrelevant.html">Gemini AI search </a>to help make sense of it all.</p>



<p>But &mdash; and this is a big but &mdash; this isn&rsquo;t here yet. It will roll out in Google&rsquo;s Labs workspace this fall. And even then, consumers will have to pay a whopping $19.95 per user per month for the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://one.g

<p>It&rsquo;s the start of Google&rsquo;s yearly I/O developer event today. But Google doesn&rsquo;t seem all that interested in telling developers what they&rsquo;ll be able to do with Google &mdash; it&rsquo;s more interested in telling regular users <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2230933/google-bard-ai-is-officially-gemini-unofficially-irrelevant.html">all the cool stuff that the company&rsquo;s Gemini AI</a> can do right now, and will be able to do in the future. Presenters <em>really </em>wanted us to know we&rsquo;re in the &ldquo;Gemini era.&rdquo; </p>



<p>What does that mean for regular users? More or less, it&rsquo;s all about smarter searching that pulls more and deeper information from more websites, and organizes it in smart ways. It all starts with &ldquo;AI Overviews,&rdquo; the new, fancy version of the Rich Results you currently see befo

<p>USB-C is the one connection to rule them all&mdash;literally, in many cases, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1341415/europe-sets-deadline-for-usb-c-charging-for-almost-all-laptops.html">thanks to a recent law passed by the European Parliament</a>. Its popularity has made USB-C a common sight on new monitors. A USB-C monitor can act as USB hub, giving you additional ports for connecting various USB devices, but the monitor&rsquo;s USB-C port can also serve as a video-input alternative to HDMI or DisplayPort; and some USB-C monitors can even charge a connected device while in use.</p>



<p>The details of USB-C can be confusing, however, and pricing for USB-C monitors is often higher than that for monitors that lack the interface. See our buyers&rsquo; guide below our recommendations to better understand the nuances.</p>

<p>What the heck is going on over at Google&rsquo;s Chrome Dome (which is what I assume they call the place where they have all the Chrome software developers)? <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2329804/chrome-zero-day-exploits-are-now-coming-once-a-month.html">Just four days</a> after we told you about the latest Chrome zero-day security exploit, there&rsquo;s another one that needs yet another critical update to the browser. That&rsquo;s the sixth one so far in 2024. </p>



<p>Once again Google is recommending that users immediately update their browsers to apply the fix, which went out yesterday.

<p>When your remote control no longer responds or your kid&rsquo;s favorite toy stops working, you&rsquo;re often faced with the question: Did the batteries die or is the device defective? </p>



<p>A dead-simple, wonderfully nifty test offers a quick and reliable way to check the actual charge state of a battery, keeping you from rashly discarding good batteries or buying new ones unnecessarily. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="battery-full-or-flat-this-simple-test-reveals-it">Battery full or flat? This simple test reveals it</h2>



<p>All you need for this test is the battery you want to check. If available, have a new, fully charged battery ready to compare the results. This is how it works:</p>



<ol>
<li>Make sure you have a flat and firm surface, such as a table, in front of you.</li>



<li>Drop the battery vertically onto the surface from a height

## Could your VPN get around the TikTok ban? What you need to know

<p>The dreaded moment for lovers of #dancechallenges and #funnyvideos is one step closer to reality. In April, President Joe Biden signed a law that will effectively ban TikTok in the United States unless the Chinese-owned social media giant is sold within a year. TikTok responded last week by suing the U.S. government, arguing the law violates First Amendment rights. </p>



<p>As we wait for all the legal issues to resolve, now is a good time to stay two steps ahead, and ponder a fundamental question: If the ban <em>does </em>go into effect, could a VPN help you get around the new restrictions? </p>



<p>Much of the answer keys into the specific nature of the ban&mdash;namely, that app stores in the U.S. would ostensibly be forced to remove the TikTok app from their marketplaces. If that&rsquo;s how the ban plays out, then theoretically a VPN should put you back

<p>Laptop sticker prices don&rsquo;t really matter. Yes, obviously the price you pay for a laptop matters, but a laptop&rsquo;s &ldquo;manufacturer-suggested retail price&rdquo; (MSRP) isn&rsquo;t something you should focus on when picking your next laptop.</p>



<p>If you&rsquo;re buying a laptop, you&rsquo;ll get the most value from focusing on sales. Let&rsquo;s say you have $1200 to spend on a gaming laptop. The best gaming laptop for your dollar might not be a $1200 laptop at all &mdash; it might be a $1600 laptop that&rsquo;s currently $500 off.</p>



<p>In fact, the best value may be snatching up last year&rsquo;s laptop on a clearance sale. Laptop hardware isn&rsquo;t advancing very quickly year over year. A laptop from last year might be roughly as good as one from this year &mdash; and half off, too.</p>
