MEGALOPOLIS is an epic Roman fable set in a modern America. The city of New Rome must change, which leads to conflicts between the brilliant artist Cesar Catilina (Adam Driver) and his adversary, the mayor Franklyn Cicero (Giancarlo Esposito). While one dares to take the leap into a utopian, idealistic future, the other clings to a backward-looking status quo characterized by greed, vested interests and partisan warfare. Between them stands Julia Cicero (Nathalie Emmanuel) , the mayor's daughter, whose love for Caesar has divided her loyalties and forces her to find out what she believes humanity really deserves.
