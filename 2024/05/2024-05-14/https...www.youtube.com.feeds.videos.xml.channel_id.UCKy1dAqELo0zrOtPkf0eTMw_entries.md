In today's Daily Fix:
Microsoft has revealed the second wave of games coming to the Game Pass service this month. Headlining the group is Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2. The game is the long-awaited follow-up to the 2017 action-adventure game that proved to be an indie hit. Also coming to the service is Lords of the Fallen (not to be confused with the 2014 Lords of the Fallen, of which this is a quasi-sequel/soft reboot), EA Sports NHL 24, Chants of Sennaar, Moving Out 2, Immortals of Aveum, and more. In other news, Square Enix is admitted their latest Final Fantasy games have not met financial expectations. Last year's Final Fantasy 16, this year's Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, and the multiplayer game Foamstars contributed to a loss of operating income for the company. Square Enix will undergo a restructuring, and will pursue a multiplatform strategy (Final Fantasies 16 and 7 Rebirth were both PS5 exclusive).

The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power Season 2 debuts on Prime Video on August 29, 2024.

The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power brings to screens for the very first time the heroic legends of the fabled Second Age of Middle-earth's history. This epic drama is set thousands of years before the events of J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings books and will take viewers back to an era in which great powers were forged, kingdoms rose to glory and fell to ruin, unlikely heroes were tested, hope hung by the finest of threads, and the greatest villain that ever flowed from Tolkien’s pen threatened to cover all the world in darkness.

In Season Two of The Rings of Power, Sauron has returned. Cast out by Galadriel, without army or ally, the rising Dark Lord must now rely on his own cunning to rebuild his strength and oversee the creation of the Rings of Power, which will allow him to bind all the peoples of Middle-earth to his sinister will.

Building on Season One’s epic scope and ambition, the new season plunges even its most beloved and vulnerable characters into a rising tide of darkness, challenging each to find their place in a world that is increasingly on the brink of calamity. Elves and dwarves, orcs and men, wizards and Harfoots… as friendships are strained and kingdoms begin to fracture, the forces of good will struggle ever more valiantly to hold on to what matters to them most of all… each other.

House of the Dragon, the prequel of sorts to Game of Thrones, really wants you to pick a side. All must choose! Will you support Queen Rhaenyra, firstborn named heir to King Viserys? Or this other guy who watches babies kill each other for fun, also he’s a drunk and a rapist. Wow, what a choice. Through some book tweaks and show choices that were, well, A REAL CHOICE, I’m talking about you, Larys Strong and the foot…enthusiasm, I’m going to break down why House of the Dragon made it really hard if not totally impossible for any normal person not trolling to support Team Green. Because while one side has one guy with really cool vibes, the other side literally has everything else going for it.
