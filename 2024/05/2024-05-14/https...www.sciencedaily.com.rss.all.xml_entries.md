The latest 'Florida Climate Resilience Survey' found that 90% of Floridians believe that climate change is happening. Belief in human-caused climate change has surged among Florida Independents while slipping among Republicans in the state since last fall. But despite these changes, the survey found enduring support among Floridians for increased government action to address the consequences of a warming planet. The survey found 68% of all respondents want state government to do more and 69% want the federal government to do more to address climate change.

Researchers have demonstrated a technique that allows people who manufacture metal machine parts with 3D printing technologies to conduct automated quality control of manufactured parts during the finishing process. The technique allows users to identify potential flaws without having to remove the parts from the manufacturing equipment, making production time more efficient.

## People without an inner voice have poorer verbal memory

The vast majority of people have an ongoing conversation with themselves, an inner voice, that plays an important role in their daily lives. But between 5-10 per cent of the population do not have the same experience of an inner voice, and they find it more difficult to perform certain verbal memory tasks, new research shows.

## An easy pill to swallow -- new 3D printing research paves way for personalized medication

## Some brain cells age faster and are more prevalent in Alzheimer's
 - [https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/05/240514141308.htm](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/05/240514141308.htm)

Engineers have discovered that some brain cells age more rapidly than others, and they are disproportionately abundant in individuals afflicted with Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, researchers observed male-female-specific differences in the aging process of certain brain cells, with the female cortex exhibiting a higher ratio of 'old' oligodendrocytes to 'old' neurons compared to the male cortex. The discoveries were made possible by a new technique called MUSIC (multinucleic acid interaction mapping in single cells), which allows researchers to peek inside individual brain cells and map out interactions between chromatin--which is the tightly coiled form of DNA -- and RNA.

## People with more copies of ribosomal DNA may have higher risks of developing disease

Ribosomal DNA (rDNA) is present in hundreds of copies in the genome, but has not previously been part of genetic analyses. A new study of 500,000 individuals indicates that people who have more copies of rDNA are more likely to develop inflammation and diseases during their lifetimes.
