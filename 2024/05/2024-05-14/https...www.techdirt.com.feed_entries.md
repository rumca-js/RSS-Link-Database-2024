There&#8217;s no shortage of prognostication about the future of generative AI, including plenty of predictions that it won&#8217;t actually be around forever for various reasons.

Pitching its ALPRs (automatic license plate readers) to gated communities, Flock promises a crime-free future its pseudo-research can&#8217;t back up. Not that any of that mattered to any of these suburban authoritarians. [&#8230;]

Former FCC Chair Ajit Pai seems to have forgotten the First Amendment in his rush to support the TikTok ban. In a recent Fox Business interview, Pai stumbled through a series of perplexing statements, leaving us wondering if he&#8217;s ever actually read the bill he&#8217;s defending. And look, we’ve criticized Pai a lot here on [&#8230;]
