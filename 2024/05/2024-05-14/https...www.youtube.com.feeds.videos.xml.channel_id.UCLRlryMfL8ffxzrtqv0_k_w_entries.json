The city of New Rome must change, which leads to conflicts between the brilliant artist Cesar Catilina (Adam Driver) and his adversary, the mayor Franklyn Cicero (Giancarlo Esposito). While one dares to take the leap into a utopian, idealistic future, the other clings to a backward-looking status quo characterized by greed, vested interests and partisan warfare. Between them stands Julia Cicero (Nathalie Emmanuel) , the mayor's daughter, whose love for Caesar has divided her loyalties and forces her to find out what she believes humanity really deserves.\n\nMegalopolis rent/buy \u27a4 https://amzo.in/movie/00h/megalopolis\nMost popular movies right now \u27a4 https://amzo.in/bestsellermovies\nMost wanted movies of all time \u27a4 https:", "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9-mlQAdfCA", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCLRlryMfL8ffxzrtqv0_k_w", "source_obj__id": 173, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/g9-mlQAdfCA/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "MEGALOPOLIS Trailer (2024) Adam Driver", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
