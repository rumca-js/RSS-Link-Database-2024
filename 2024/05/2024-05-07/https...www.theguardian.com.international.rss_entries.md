<p>From a man with a mullet letting off fireworks to a Slovenian witch, this year’s Eurovision has some of the wildest entries ever. It makes our own entry look rather bland …</p><p>The bookies’ favourite, and you can see why. For one thing, it addresses a hot-button social issue – the lyrics deal with Nemo Mettler’s non-binary gender identity – that’s also very Eurovision-friendly. In 1998, Eurovision had a transgender winner, Dana International, 34 years before Kim Petras became the first transgender woman to top the UK and US chart with Unholy. More importantly, it’s that rare thing, an original-sounding Eurovision entry that’s charmingly preposterous rather than straight-up daft – its drum’n’bass-influenced rhythm interrupted by high-drama mock-operatics and a vocal that shifts from rapping to falsetto melodrama. You could imagine it in the UK singles chart, which is something one seldom feels with Eurovision songs.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/article/202
