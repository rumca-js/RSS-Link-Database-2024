<p>We&rsquo;re finally reaching the point where OLED gaming monitors are, if not exactly affordable, then at least somewhat attainable. Consider Gigabyte&rsquo;s 49-inch ultrawide OLED: With a retail price of $1100, it&rsquo;s a steal <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2278597/samsung-huge-odyssey-g9-oled-ultrawide-monitor-is-800-off.html">next to the similar Samsung model</a>, which is $1800 at sticker price.
