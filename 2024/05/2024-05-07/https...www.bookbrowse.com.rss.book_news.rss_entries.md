Simon & Schuster has bought VBK (Veen Bosch & Keuning), the largest publisher of adult and children's general-interest books in the Netherlands. The move marks S&amp;S's first ownership of a foreign-language publisher and its first time owning a continental European publisher--and its first major move to expand internationally since it was bought by KKR and became a stand-alone company two years ago. The acquisition is subject to the regulatory review process required under Dutch law.
