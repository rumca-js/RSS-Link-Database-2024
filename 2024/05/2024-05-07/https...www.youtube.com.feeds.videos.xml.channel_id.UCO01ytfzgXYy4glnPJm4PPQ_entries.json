And I don't often make TV show recommendations, but a new reality show out of Australia is unintentionally the funniest thing on TV right now. Finally, Star Wars has introduced another non-binary character. That brings up an important question: why is anyone still watching anything related to Star Wars?\u00a0\n\nTIMESTAMPS:\n\n00:00 - 00:40 Opening \n2:04 - 16:39 The Met Gala Is The Latest Casualty As Leftist Protesters Turn On Their Masters \n17:43 - 26:26 Anti-Israel Protestors Vandalize WWII Memorial\n26:27 - 40:16 Kristi Noem's Downfall Continues\n40:17 - 50:10 I", "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUTZ-z1EJlQ", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCO01ytfzgXYy4glnPJm4PPQ", "source_obj__id": 212, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/lUTZ-z1EJlQ/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "The Met Gala Is The Latest Casualty As Leftist Protesters Turn On Their Masters | Ep. 1363", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-05-07T17:00:20+00:00", "description": "", "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yu1pb8mEJuY", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCO01ytfzgXYy4glnPJm4PPQ", "source_obj__id": 212, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/Yu1pb8mEJuY/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "AI will quickly ruin the country unless we...", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-05-07T17:00:18+00:00", "description": "", "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJyvcQBC0oA", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCO01ytfzgXYy4glnPJm4PPQ", "source_obj__id": 212, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/ZJyvcQBC0oA/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "This is the worst advice.", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-05-07T00:00:13+00:00", "description": "Kristi Noem goes on Face the Nation to promote her new book.
