STRIVE, which has UW atmospheric scientist Lyatt Jaegl\u00e9 as its principal investigator, would focus on interactions between the stratosphere and the troposphere &#8212; and the effect of those interactions on atmospheric phenomena ranging from storm severity to perturbations in the ozone layer. The three other studies winning support from NASA&#8217;s new Earth System Explorers Program are ODYSEA, EDGE and Carbon-I.
