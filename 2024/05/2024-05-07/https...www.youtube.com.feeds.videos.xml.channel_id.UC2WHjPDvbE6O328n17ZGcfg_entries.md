Welcome to part one of my two part series on the most important computer scientists in history. These men and women built and laid the foundation for the modern computing age, from information, to programming, to the computers themselves. Without these individuals, you would not be watching this video right now - or any video for that matter - the computer you're currently using wouldn't exist, and we would live in a completely different world. The stories of these individuals should be much more widely known, and this is my attempt at helping with that notion. Enjoy!!
