Raspberry Pi Connect is a new service to remote control Raspberry Pis.

You can try it out on your own Pis with a Raspberry Pi ID, check out the documentation here: https://connect.raspberrypi.com/

RealVNC is still useful too; though I hope they update it soon to work with Wayland on Pi OS 12 'Bookworm'! If you want to get RealVNC working on Pi OS 12, see: https://help.realvnc.com/hc/en-us/articles/14110635000221-Raspberry-Pi-5-Bookworm-and-RealVNC-Connect
