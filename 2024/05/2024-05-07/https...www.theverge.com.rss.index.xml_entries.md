  <p id="sdllhM">Apple is releasing a new Final Cut Camera app for iPhone and iPad that can take video and stream it live back to an iPad for a Multicam shoot, as well as provide more controls for filmmakers. The company’s new pro-level app provides “precise manual controls” and can be used as a plain standalone camera app.</p>
<p id="0ZL9hF">The new Final Cut Camera is launching alongside the updated Final Cut 2 app, a successor to last year’s debut Final Cut for iPad. Final Cut 2 has a multiscreen view that captures and controls each Final Cut Camera-running device connected to it. Final Cut 2 also lets you hop between production and editing, allowing you to live-cut your project.</p>

After holding and playing with the device for a few minutes, I can say pretty confidently that Apple’s not kidding about how much more svelte the new model is. At 5.3mm thick for the 11-inch model and 5.1mm for the 13-inch tablet, this new iPad is noticeably thinner and lighter than anything the company has made before. It’s such a big difference that the larger model, which I’ve always felt was kind of preposterously huge, feels much more comfortable to hold and use. </p>

  <p id="jsLn5Y">At its “Let Loose” virtual event this morning, Apple introduced its long-awaited iPad Pro updates. The new 13-inch and 11-inch tablets have a fresh design, more powerful internals, and a thinner profile than ever before, and they come with a major display upgrade. As rumored, Apple has switched to OLED screens on both sizes, bringing perfect blacks, richer color saturation, and enhanced contrast to its flagship iPads. Oh, and the front-facing camera is now in the correct (landscape) position for video calls.</p>
<p id="xjft4w">The iPad Pros use a tandem OLED structure that allows the display to reach 1,000 nits of peak brightness and 1,600 nits for HDR content. The

The only difference is that everything will take place within Instacart’s app or website. </p>
