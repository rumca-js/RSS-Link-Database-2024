Thanks to Paramount+ for sponsoring this Short. Stream the new event series, Knuckles, on Paramount+ today!

Beware the Punch of the Echidna! In Paramount+’s trailer for their new show Knuckles, we see the namesake of the show himself and Scott Mescudi’s Agent Mason clash. Which leads to the question of how powerful is Knuckle’s strike?
