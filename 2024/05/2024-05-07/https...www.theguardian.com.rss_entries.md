Can the duo play stricken lovers in The Deep Blue Sea, the eviscerating play Rattigan poured his own heartbreak into? <em>Warning: contains spoilers</em></p><p>On 8 May 1956, Terence Rattigan stood outside the Royal Court theatre in London after the opening night of a revolutionary new drama. This was not one of his own plays but a sally from the upstart generation: John Osborne’s Look Back in Anger. Or, as the veteran playwright bitterly renamed it: Look How Unlike Terence Rattigan I’m Being. Refinement was out, the Angry Young Man was in, and the author of Separate Tables and The Winslow Boy had plummeted from favour.</p><p>But that all changed in 1993 – with Karel Reisz’s revival of The Deep Blue Sea, Rattigan’s most penetrating work. Penelope Wilton played Hester Collyer, who is separated from her husband, a primly patriarchal high court judge. She now lives in sin with her younger lover, the carousing ex-RAF pilot Freddie Page

<p>Tiger Stripes, about a girl who turns into a jungle cat when her periods start, was chosen by Malaysia as its Oscar entry. But they wanted cuts. Amanda Nell Eu relives a ‘painful and comedic’ experience</p><p>The director Amanda Nell Eu has always been a bit of a rebel, she says over video chat from her home in Kuala Lumpur. “When I was a teenager, I was sometimes labelled a monster by my parents and teachers. I probably wasn’t the most obedient child.” Now Eu has turned the horrors of puberty into an actual horror movie. Tiger Stripes is her feature debut, a funny and political film with a whopping air punch of girl power. Set in a conservative Muslim school, it mixes body horror with Mean Girls energy and a sprinkle of Malaysian folklore.</p><p>Eu cast her trio of leading girls during lockdown, putting adverts on Instagram and searching through TikTok profiles: “Schools were shut, everything was shut.” Zafreen Zairizal plays 12-year-old Zaffan, a rebel who is constantly yanking o

Restored and rereleased, Big Banana Feet is the 1976 documentary about Billy Connolly’s live shows in Dublin and Belfast the year before, just after his appearance on the BBC’s Parkinson show made him a star virtually overnight, and allowed his legions of new fans to hear him live and unexpurgated.</p><p>Billy and his hangdog entourage – all looking like a very downbeat version of the Bay City Rollers – travel to Dublin then to Belfast by private plane, but aside from that, everything looks very non-luxury.

<p>Dozens of film professionals fell prey to Hargobind Tahilramani, who tricked them into parting with thousands of dollars. The makers of new documentary Hollywood Con Queen reveal how he was tracked down</p><p>In 2017, the New-York-based freelance photographer and film-maker Will Strathman received a thrilling email: the megaproducer Amy Pascal wanted to talk. Her initial message explained that he had been recommended by someone at a fashion brand for whom Strathman has previously worked. On the phone, Pascal described a TV show she planned to pitch to Netflix that would showcase rare beauty spots around the world. Would he be interested in going to Indonesia to create a storyboard for the pilot?</p><p>It was a surprising opportunity to get out of the blue. But Strathman was a talented professional and felt he could deliver what Pascal needed. He paid for a flight to Jakarta and worked tirelessly photographing locations, before spending hours each night updating Pascal on the phone.

It didn’t help that the singer herself repeated it in scores of interviews.

I had a bad headache for about two weeks and then, all of a sudden, I was singing higher.”</p><p>The “new” sound she supposedly produced was what allegedly convinced group’s leader John Phillips to finally bring her into the fold, creating what became one of the most famous four-way harmony groups in pop history.

Like Virginia Woolf, he records moments of being although, unlike her, his moments are likely to be guarded and seldom ecstatic and to involve openly philosophical reckoning. He is curious about how to situate himself – and by implication us – in time and space. The recognition that time can neither hold or be held is at once an ongoing preoccupation – and a provocation. In The Hare, he lends the day a human quality: “I wake into the morning / and find unanimous spring / and the windows are pale with filtered light / and the day asks, <em>How shall I survive myself?”</em><em> </em>Time runs out and into Bagnal

<p>A riff on kedgeree featuring roast aubergines and peas, and a rich and smoky lamb curry</p><p>This week, I bring you two approaches to weeknight dinner. First, a new take on kedgeree that’s swiftly put together and swaps the traditional boiled eggs for roast aubergines. Kedgeree was the invention of the British in colonial India, but was inspired by <em>khichuri</em>, a more ancient dish of rice and lentils, so here I’ve reinstated the pulses in the form of mung dal and peas: an Indian dish, adapted by the British, and changed again by an Indian living in Britain. The other dish is a smoky lamb curry that I often make ahead at the weekend – it freezes really well and makes for a bowl of richly spiced comfort to come home to.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/may/07/kedgeree-and-lamb-curry-recipes-tamal-ray">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This evocative account of the author’s mother and aunt – identical sisters who stole the hearts of London’s 1930s intelligentsia – captures their closeness and lust for life</p><p>Somewhere in her house – though not, I think, in an attic – Ariane Bankes keeps a battered tin trunk, the precious contents of which enabled her to write this short biography of her mother, Celia, and her aunt, Mamaine, who were identical twins. Such a project, though, was quite long in the gestation – Mamaine died before Bankes was born, in 1954, and Celia, who left her the trunk full of letters, in 2002 – and I wonder if this was because she worried just a little about the story she was to tell. The Paget twins were undoubtedly beautiful, spirited and clever. As debs, they were photographed by Madame Yevonde for <em>Tatler; </em>their circle included Laurie Lee, Decca Mitford and Simone de Beauvoir. But their principal fascination for the modern reader lies not with their own achievements, but with thei

<p>Oh dear – Ms Carter, née Aldridge, had been flourishing and off the drink. But after a sexual slip, she succumbed to the siren call of a bottle</p><p>The Furies who had been circling for Alice Carter, née Aldridge, seemed for a time to have retreated. After the various catastrophes of her alcoholism, she had been flourishing in recent months: off the drink, managing the riding stables, pulling through her mother’s death, and successfully co-parenting her daughter Martha alongside her ex-husband, sexy Chris the farrier. But just as in Greek tragedy a single decision can change the course of a life, so it is in Ambridge. Alice, I suspect, was doomed the very moment she decided to “help” her recent love interest, the awful Posh Harry (not to be confused with her friend, unposh and wholly delightful Harrison the policeman), to extract himself from his own drink problem, a secret affliction of which she became aware only after they had begun to fall hard for each other.

It was said she had only agreed to play the festival because the author, César Aira, would be in the audience. Aira, although celebrated in his home country, Argentina, was little known outside Latin America until he was discovered in 2002 by the Berlin-based literary agent Michael Gaeb, who was enchanted by his unconventional, surrealist books, which shift atmosphere, and even genre, from one page to another.</p><p>At first it proved difficult to sell Aira’s novels to a wider audience. “The fundamental problem when promoting César’s work is that the editor always asks: ‘What is the novel about?’” Gaeb told me. “And in th
