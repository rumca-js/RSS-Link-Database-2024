The update delves into more of the game's systems, including combat, archetypes, and bonds, as well as offers fans a closer look at some of the game's art and locations.</p><p>According to Studio Zero, Metaphor: ReFantazio's combat will be one of its more innovative features and "an evolution in command battle." Rather than traditional turn-based battle, the game will implement a "Fast and Squad" system that allows players to switch between real-time action, or Fast mode, and traditional command based combat, referred to in the game as Squad mode. When in Fast mode, players can use the lock-on, dash, and evade functions while they are exploring, eliminating the need to enter traditional turn-based combat.
