<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So background I have a Nas running unraid with Swag running Nginx mainly as a media server. I have my own domain name setup through cloudflare with ad guard home running as a DNS.</p> <p>Recently I moved some of my services that are internal only onto my domain name, using the Nginx server with allow/deny commands in the location blocks to only allow my local ips but not my router. Then ad guard keeps the DNS route local. </p> <p>I haven't seen anything online that says this is a bad idea, it's even in the Nginx docs, but can't help but worry that I am creating a security vulnerability. Any suggestions welcome for what to do instead.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/accountabillibudy"> /u/accountabillibudy </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1cmq8wp/nginx_security_question/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1cmq8

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So, a while back I ran Jellyfin just installed on a VM in proxmox. I have my NAS that has all of my videos and media files hosted on it. I could mount and fstab the nas directory I wanted straight to the ubuntu vm that had jellyfin installed and jellyfin would find the mounted drive and be able to access the media super easily. Worked great.</p> <p>Now im hard pressed on using docker, docker is so easy and convenient. BUT....how do i mount a network drive to a docker container that has jellyfin so that jellyfin can see it and access the directory? is there any easy way to do this? </p> <p>Is there an alternate solution by chance? What I could do is have an RSYNC to my second NAS of the files that I want on there, install jellyfin through docker and it might see the files that way? might? i dont know.</p> <p>I just need opinions/help if anyone else has come across this before. Thanks</p> <p>&#x200b;</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi guys, I should be working on the design of a website hosted on OVHcloud. I have some questions about phpMyAdmin, backups and FTP that I hope you can help me clarify. I've never used OVHcloud before. As per routine, before carrying out a job I backup the files and the database. By accessing the database via phpMyAdmin, I am asked for login credentials. The user is automatically filled in, but the question is: how can I find the phpMyAdmin password that allows me to access the db (not the database one) or change it without disturbing customers? Furthermore, does OVHcloud provide a control panel such as cPanel for managing the website or will I have to access it via ftp/sftp to make site backups? Thank you in advance for your time!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Nemesi_361"> /u/Nemesi_361 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1cmq1k1/doubts_ovhcloud_for_phpmyadmi

So far most of the services I've switched over to it have worked good and I haven't had too much trouble connecting them to Keycloak. Guacamole on the other hand, seems to not be working as well. I have the auth-sso-openid extension installed on guacamole in the extension folder, and I have the openid configurations in the <a href="https://guacamole.properties">guacamole.properties</a> file. When I go to my guacamole url, it takes me to keycloak to log in, but when I put my keycloak credentials in it comes up with a bad gateway 502 error. I've followed all the instructions that I could find and as far as I can tell I have things configured correctly. One thing I'm not sure about though is the jwsk_uri and what exactly that needs to get for guacamole or keycloak to redirect correctly to. </p> <p>I have both gua

I'm hoping some of you here might help or explain this to me properly.</p> <p>From what I understand, using a self-hosted proxy means you manage the server yourself, so you'd get more control over your data. What I'm really curious about is how much of a privacy improvement I can expect if I switch from a commercial service to a self-hosted setup and whether it's really worth it for me. Specifically, how does self-hosting give you better control over data logs and personal information?</p> <p>So, do self-hosted proxies really offer a higher level of privacy compared to the ones you pay for? And is it worth the cost/time for a small office setup of 4 computers? Is it even possible for someone with &quot;amateur-leve

If I connect back to 5G the errors go away. When I look at the certificate header in the browser its showing some opnsense.local certificate issuer thing which I do not know whats thats about as I do not have opnsense doing jack with certs, is there some certificate cache in opnsense I need to clear or something.
