We need to have an honest conversation about smoking: The problem with smoking is that it is way more than just a physical addiction.
Smoking creates a temporary problem and offers an instant solution. Once your brain is used to nicotine, for up to 72 hours you are itchy,  
nervous and stressed – but one drag and instantly, you feel really good. It also helps you focus and take breaks during work, while suppressing your appetite. 
So why is it such a bad idea?
