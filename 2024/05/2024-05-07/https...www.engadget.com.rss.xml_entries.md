<p>There’s one clear perk that Android has over iOS and that’s variety when it comes to the phones you have to choose from. Apple has made the iPhone is the only game in town for iOS, but with Google’s operating system, there are dozens of choices out there from manufacturers like Samsung, Motorola, OnePlus and others. But that also means it can be difficult to decide which device is best for you when it comes time to upgrade, or if you want to switch from iPhone to Android in the new year. If you’re looking for a new phone and don’t know where to start, we’ve got you covered with a selection of the best Android phones for every budget.<br /><br /><strong>Editor’s note (5/7/24)</strong>: Google has announced the Pixel 8a, its latest midrange smartphone. The 6.1-inch handset starts at $499 and, as expected, takes many of its cues from last year’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/pixel-8-and-pixel-8-pro-review-googles-most-compelling-phones-in-years-specs-price-170022742.html">flagship

## Everything announced at Apple's Let Loose iPad event

<p>Another Apple event is in the books and, as expected, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/how-to-watch-apples-ipad-launch-event-on-tuesday-152650009.html"><ins>Let Loose showcase</ins></a> was all about iPad. We now have our first Apple device powered by an M4 chip in the iPad Pro, with the company surprisingly choosing to debut it there rather than in a Mac. There's also an upgraded iPad Air that's available in two sizes: 11 inches and 13 inches.</p>
<p>There are some accessory updates too, which isn't a big shock given that an Apple Pencil was prominent in the event's teaser image. So, without further ado, here's a rundown of everything Apple announced at its blessedly brief Let Loose event.</p>

<p>Compared to the iPad Pro, the changes Apple made to the iPad Air are more modest. Rather than a total redesign, the iPad Air is getting some expected and slightly overdue changes: a new screen size, a new processor and a front-facing camera that is placed on the landscape side of the tablet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, that's some faint praise, but there's a lot to like about the new iPad Air. It's long been the best overall iPad, straddling the line between the budget entry model and the wildly powerful and expensive Pro lineup. That's the case here, again. But now that the 13-inch iPad Pro is even more pricey than before, it's good to see a large-screen iPad that doesn't cost well over $1,000.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The 11-inch iPad Air is identical in size and weight to the old one, though the screen is .1 inches bigger this time. So there's not a whole lot to say about that one. The 13-inch Air, however, feels quite a bit like the old 12.9-inch iPad Pro that w

<p>A new Pixel A-series phone typically gets announced at Google I/O. Unfortunately, that means the affordable handset sometimes gets buried amongst all the other news during the company’s annual developer conference. So for 2024, Google moved things up a touch to give the new Pixel 8a extra attention. And after checking it out in person, I can see why. It combines pretty much everything I like about the regular <a href="https://www.engadget.com/pixel-8-and-pixel-8-pro-review-googles-most-compelling-phones-in-years-specs-price-170022742.html">Pixel 8</a> but with a lower price of $499.</p>
<p>Right away, you’ll see a very familiar design. Compared to the standard Pixel 8, which has a 6.2-inch screen, the 8a features a slightly smaller 6.1-inch OLED display with noticeably larger bezels. But aside from that, the Pixel 8 and 8a are almost the exact same size. Google says the material covering the display should be pretty durable as it's made out of Gorilla Glass, though it hasn’t specif

That's not a bad thing, as the old iPad Pro design was outstanding. But there's no doubt Apple is flexing its hardware engineering muscles with these new tablets, not just with the M4 chip inside.</p>
<p>Both tablets are noticeably thinner and lighter than the ones they replace, something I didn't really think was possible before. It's frankly a little absurd to see such a thin and light device with such an advanced display and powerful processor. It still feels like the prior iPad Pro, just in a more refined package. My big question is around durability, something Apple mentioned during its keynote — I'd be a little worried about bending these iPads, but hopefully

<p>Apple's new iPad Pro models are its most laptop-like tablets yet. They're the first devices powered by the company's M4 chip, which will deliver faster performance and more AI capabilities. And, for the first time outside of the iPhone and Apple Watch, both the new 11-inch and (slightly larger) 13-inch iPad Pros will sport OLED screens. That's a step up from the LCD and Mini-LED displays on the previous models, and it should lead to bolder colors, inky dark black levels and far better contrast.&nbsp;</p>
<figure><img alt="iPad Pro 2024" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-05/be8b6b90-0c80-11ef-be8b-ef5ca1d09102" style="height: 1102px; width: 1960px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Appole</div></figure>
<p>These aren't your typical OLEDs, either: Apple says the new iPad Pros feature "tandem" OLED displays (branded as Ultra Display XDR) for 1,000 nits of HDR brightness and 1,500 nits of peak brightness. That solves the brightness issues facing

<p>It's about dang time. During its Let Loose event, Apple announced it has updated the iPad Air for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-air-5th-generation-review-130019050.html">the first time in over two years</a>. The latest model has an M2 chip, so it's not getting one of Apple's most recent chipsets, likely to keep costs down and differentiate it from the iPad Pro. Still, the M2 is about 50 percent faster than the M1, Apple says, and the tablet is about three times faster than the A14 Bionic-powered iPad Air from 2020.</p>
<p>Perhaps more significantly, the company has introduced an iPad Air with a 13-inch screen for the first time. That means there are two variants, as the 11-inch format is sticking around. As such, the iPad Air and iPad Pro effectively have the same display sizes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Newsletter platform Substack is ramping up its video ambitions and trying to lure TikTok stars to its service. The company announced a new ‚Äúcreator studio‚Äù that will offer a group of creators free promotion and other services if they ‚Äú turn their TikTok channels into Substack shows and communities.‚Äù</p>
<p>The program is part of a larger effort by the newsletter company to expand beyond text newsletters. The timing also happens to come just weeks after a bill that could <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/joe-biden-signs-the-bill-that-could-ban-tiktok-in-the-united-states-154106950.html">ban TikTok</a> in the United States became law, though Substack claims its plans are unrelated to the measure. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not introducing this fellowship because of panic over a TikTok bill or ever-changing algorithms,‚Äù Substack‚Äôs Austin Tedesco  writes in a blog post. Instead, he says, it‚Äôs about finding a replacement for all ‚Äúad-based platforms‚Äù which he

<p>Google‚Äôs big developer showcase, encompassing software, hardware and all its consumer AI projects, is fast approaching. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/what-to-expect-at-google-io-2024-gemini-android-15-and-more-174535938.html">Google I/O‚Äôs opening keynote</a> is on May 14, and we‚Äôve got a good guess on what you can expect.</p>
<p>To begin, Android 15‚Äôs first beta is already out. We know there will be enhanced privacy features, partial screen sharing and system-level app archiving. But they‚Äôre not the most thrilling updates ‚Äî hopefully, Google has some spicy features in its back pocket. Redesign <em>something</em>!</p>
<p>AI-wise, lots of stuff. Gemini AI is now firmly established, but what about an AI assistant? Reportedly, Pixie, as it‚Äôs currently called, could debut on the Pixel 9. We‚Äôre also expecting the company to ramp up its generative AI ‚Äî but where will it start? More editing features in Google Photos? More text help in Google Docs? Something AI with Go

<p>Meta‚Äôs Oversight Board is taking up a new set of cases that touch on the commentary surrounding the Israel-Hamas conflict. The board says it will review three cases involving Facebook posts that used the phrase ‚Äúfrom the river to the sea.‚Äù</p>

<p>The company added that it will not release any details on the Switch 2 (or whatever it'll be called) at its upcoming Nintendo Direct event in June, so we won't hear anything until at least the second half of 2024.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
