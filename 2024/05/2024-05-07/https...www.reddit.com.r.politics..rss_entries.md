I wrote a book several years ago called “The Year of Living Biblically” about following the rules of the Bible as literally as possible.</p> <p>My new book is a semi-sequel to that, and is called “The Year of Living Constitutionally.” I try to understand our Founding Document by following its original 1789 meaning.

I agreed to quarter some soldiers in my apartment.</p> <p>The book is (I hope) entertaining, but it also has a serious purpose: To explore how we should interpret this 230-year-old document. How much should we stick to the original meaning, and how much should we evolve the meaning? I do a deep dive into democracy, SCOTUS, originalism, and much more.
