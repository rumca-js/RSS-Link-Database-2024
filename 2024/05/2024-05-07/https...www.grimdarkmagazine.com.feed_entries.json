With gorgeous colors and a solid first look into what could be a fun fantasy romp, When the Blood Has Dried #1 is an interesting take on what adventurers do once the adventuring is done, and that the past never stays buried. Meabh is a retired adventurer, once a member of the so far undefined Adventurer\u2019s Guild. Her tenure with the Guild ended in blood when her former ally Darius left her for dead. Years after her escape, she\u2019s the barkeep in a cozy little tavern \u2013 Traolock\u2019s \u2013 in the peaceful town of Carraig an Bhun. This issue evokes traditional fantasy tropes with a bit of Irish flavoring to it. Those who start their Dungeons &#38; Dragons campaigns in taverns will find themselves quite at home at Traolock\u2019s. With the threat of a possible Adventurer\u2019s Guild outpost being built right in Meabh\u2019s own front yard, we see that Meabh\u2019s past is going to come back in possibly violent ways.
