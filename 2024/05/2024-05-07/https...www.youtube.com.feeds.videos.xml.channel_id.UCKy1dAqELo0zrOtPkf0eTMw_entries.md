Microsoft has made significant cuts across Bethesda, shuttering Redfall developer Arkane Austin, as well as Tango GameWorks, Alpha Dog Games, and more. Some employees at those studios will be moved to other teams, but Microsoft did not mention anything specific about layoffs. Redfall had a disastrous launch last year—the game shipped with bugs and server issues, and was met with middling to negative reviews despite being one of Microsoft's most-anticipated games of the year. Tango GameWorks' closing is a surprise, as last year's surprise hit Hi-Fi Rush was met with critical acclaim, and Microsoft's Aaron Greenberg had previously said the game had met "all key measurements and expectations." In other news, Nintendo announceds that they will announce the next Switch this fiscal year. Before you get your hopes up, that means sometime before March 2025. Nintendo al

Stardew Valley reviewed in 2024 on the PC 1.6 update, also available on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and Mobile.

Stardew Valley is not only the best farming game I’ve played, it is one of my favorite games of all time. That myself and others keep returning to this eight-year old gem each time it gets even the smallest update speaks to how it’s truly a masterpiece in the genre it both reinvigorated and has come to define. It is chock-full of bizarre and memorable characters, moments, and conversations, not to mention a never-ending to-do list that fuels the completionist in me. It’s also an intensely strategic adventure, using its cozy farming activities and cute pixel art to make the deeply engaging time management challenge underneath it all effortlessly inviting. Stardew Valley has earned a spot on your platform of choice as a modern classic, standing proudly alongside gaming’s all-time greats. I’ve played countless hours already and will surely play countless more, because every tim

V Rising reviewed by Leana Hafer on PC.

V Rising has been nicely polished up during its dark slumber in Early Access, allowing it to fully rise to the occasion with its excellent boss design and challenging ARPG combat. Keeping the killing rays of the sun and your dwindling blood supply as ongoing concerns is effective and evocative in selling the vampire fantasy, as is the ability to craft the sprawling, spooky estates of my nightmares. And the huge amount of customization available when setting up your own private server practically eliminates the need to do chores that are timed to real-world days in a way that only really makes sense for playing with a larger clan and having those timers going even when you're not online. It's one of the best ARPGs – and one of the best vampire games, in general – of this moonlit age.
