Former Blizzard president Mike Ybarra has rallied around Xbox boss Phil Spencer following Microsoft's shock decision to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-shuts-slew-of-bethesda-studios-including-redfall-hi-fi-rush-developers">close four of its game studios</a> - including Arkane Austin and Tango Gameworks - saying, "I know this hurts him as much as anyone else."
</p><p>
Ybarra made the comments on Twitter/X amid <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arkane-lyon-boss-leads-widespread-condemnation-of-bethesda-closures">widespread condemnation</a> of Microsoft's move and as anger over the closures continued to grow.

Sony is giving all Playstation and PC players limited-time access to three Destiny 2 expansions - The Witch Queen, Beyond Light, and Shadowkeep - ahead of The Final Shape's arrival in June. Additionally, Destiny 2's current expansion, Lightfall, is available to PlayStation Plus subscribers.
</p><p>
The promotion, which Sony is calling Expansion Open Access, begins today, 7th May, and runs until 3rd June - just one day ahead of The Final Shape expansion's launch. Until then, all PlayStation players have free rein of The Witch Queen, Beyond Light, and Shadowkeep, alongside Destiny 2's past four seasons of content. That's a lot to be getting on with, then, even moreso for PlayStation Plus subscribers, who can also pick up Destiny 2's Lightfall expansion as part of May's monthly games line-up - but only within the same time period.

Apple has announced a refresh of its iPad line-up, introducing, among other things, a 13-inch iPad Air and the company's first-ever OLED iPad model.
</p><p>
As revealed during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1J38FlDKxo">today's Let Loose event</a>, Apple's most substantial iPad makeover has been reserved for its top-end iPad Pro, which now features a "tandem" OLED display capable of 1,600 nits for HDR content. It's paired with Apple's M4 chip - promising up to 50 percent faster CPU and four times faster rendering performance - plus camera changes and a slimmer design.
</p><p>
This new iPad Pro, available in silver or Space Grey, shifts the front-facing 12-megapixel camera to the side so it's centred while in landscape mode, and its rear camera now supports ProRes video recording and Smart HDR 4. As for the thinner form factor, t

<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-2-early-access-review">Hades 2</a> released in early access last night, and is already pulling in some impressive numbers on Steam for concurrent players. 
</p><p>
At the time of writing, there are over 100,000 players making their way through Supergiant Games' first-ever sequel. It has eclipsed its predecessor, with the first Hades game currently holding a concurrent player record of 37,749 (although, it is worth noting that Hades was a timed-exclusive on the Epic Games Store, before it arrived on Valve's PC storefront). 
</p><p>
Additionally, it appears the launch of Hades 2 may eventually boost the concurrent player record of the first game. Figures on <a href="https://steamdb.info/charts/?compare=1145350,1145360">SteamDB</a> show that the first Hades recorded a peak of 36,043 players in the

Arkane Lyon boss Dinga Bakaba and others from across the industry have reacted to today's news of devastating closures at Bethesda.
</p><p>
Earlier today, news broke that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-shuts-slew-of-bethesda-studios-including-redfall-hi-fi-rush-developers">Microsoft is making huge cuts at Bethesda</a>, including closing Redfall studio Arkane Austin, Hi-Fi Rush studio Tango Gameworks, and Mighty Doom studio Alpha Dog Games.

</p><p>
Bakaba, Arkane Lyon's studio and co-creative director, described the decision as "absolutely terrible" in an irate thread on X, formerly Twitter.

In the wake of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-shuts-slew-of-bethesda-studios-including-redfall-hi-fi-rush-developers">devastating closures at Bethesda</a>, Arkane Austin has confirmed the Hero Pass DLC for Redfall will no longer be released.
</p><p>
Instead, players who purchased the pass as part of the &pound;100 Bite Back Edition or &pound;30 upgrade will receive credit to the same value as the pass.
</p><p>
As <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/redfall-hero-pass-dlc-still-missing-a-year-after-its-release">Eurogamer reported last week</a>, it's been a year since Redfall's launch and its promised Hero Pass was yet to be released. Now, players are being <a href="https://help.bethesda.net/?linkId=100000260400360#en/answer/65606">directed to sign up to receive credit</a>, with details currently being finalised.

Beat Saber will no longer be supported on Meta Quest 1 VR headsets later this year.
</p><p>
According to an <a href="https://beatsaber.com/faq.html#metaquest1">FAQ on the game's website</a>, the developer is aiming to "raise the bar of what's possible", meaning it will focus on more recent and powerful devices instead.

</p><p>
Beat Saber will remain playable on Meta Quest 1 devices, but from 2nd November support will end. This means no multiplayer or leaderboard functionality, and no further updates, although the game will remain accessible.

Nintendo expects Switch to sell another 13.5m units during the coming financial year - enough that it will overtake Nintendo DS to become the company's best-selling platform. In total, Switch is now on 141.32m units sold.
</p><p>
In financial results published today - alongside which Nintendo mentioned <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a> for the first time - Nintendo forecast enough Switch 1 sales to take the aging console to 154.82m sold.
</p><p>
As a reminder, Nintendo DS finished its sales run on 154.02m. PlayStation 2 is believed to be on 155m, although Sony has not provided a firm figure.

Final Fantasy 14 has suffered a DDoS attack, though issues appear to now be fixed.
</p><p>
Yesterday, technical difficulties were experienced in all data centres across the globe, including issues with logging into the game or being disconnected. In a <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/news/detail/bdf23a5692dea624fbb355bc220248de7dec4ad8">blog post</a>, Square Enix stated it is "investigating the attack and taking countermeasures".
</p><p>
It seems the issue may now have been fixed. This morning I had no issue logging in following a short game update. Eurogamer has contacted Square Enix to confirm.

Nintendo has officially discussed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a> for the first time, and laid out a rough timetable for when we'll see the much-discussed but still under-wraps console publicly unveiled. 
</p><p>
A <a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoCoLtd/status/1787736518762881197">message</a> from Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa, posted this morning to social media platform X, confirms we'll hear of Switch 2 "this fiscal year" - before the end of March 2025. 
</p><p>
But the message also damps down any expectation we'll hear about Switch 2 in the next few months - as Furukawa rules out any further details being shared in an upcoming Nintendo Direct scheduled for June.
