Well, the friendship bread model is not too dissimilar from the way Erik Koskinen and his friends put together the songs for Down Street/Love Avenue, Koskinen’s latest album, released April 5. “I kind of just invited a lot of musician friends to add stuff to [my demos],” Koskinen explains. “And the idea was if I let them add something to it, and they thought of somebody else who would be good for that track, they were then invited to give it to somebody else without me even having to really know about it. It wasn't really a plan, and that built into what happened on how the record got made.”

Koskinen and his bandmates visited the Radio Heartland studio to play a selection of tracks from the forthcoming album. Watch and listen to "Keep My Baby With Me" above.
All songs from Erik Koskinen’s 2024 album, Down Street/Love Avenue, available on Real Phonic Records.
