While I’m still waiting for TikTok to release its 30-second long dancing interpretation of why the TikTok ban is unconstitutional, at least it’s now going to court to make the argument for real. It took maybe a week or so longer than expected, but TikTok and ByteDance have now officially filed their lawsuit challenging the [&#8230;]

The National Center for Missing &#38; Exploited Children&#8216;s CyberTipline is a central component of the fight against child sexual abuse material (CSAM) online, but there have been a lot of questions about how well it truly works. A recent report from the Stanford Internet Observatory, which we&#8217;ve published two recent posts about, provides an extremely [&#8230;]

Editor&#8217;s Note: This post was written before TikTok &#38; ByteDance filed a lawsuit challenging the law this morning. So, while it says that no lawsuit has been filed, that&#8217;s no longer the case. The rest of the article is still relevant, though. We&#8217;ll have an analysis of the actual lawsuit later (probably tomorrow). Over the [&#8230;]

Wars, conflicts, domestic dust-ups, whatever you want to call them&#8230; they&#8217;re sensitive situations, easily made worse by even the most mild fluctuations in the political climate or the public temperament. And while I&#8217;m completely aware there&#8217;s no enshrined rights protecting journalism on par with the First Amendment in Israel, this latest turn of events does [&#8230;]

Jann Wenner, the creator of Rolling Stone magazine, was certainly an early supporter of free speech. But he seems to have reached grumpy old man status, that allows him to whine about free speech online, mostly by not knowing shit about anything. Writing for Air Mail, a publication by Graydon Carter (another Grumpy Old Man [&#8230;]

As the streaming sector has consolidated and new subscriber growth has slowed, it has increasingly started chasing the bad habits of the industry it once disrupted: cable TV. Gone is stuff like encouraged password sharing and risk-taking programming. In its place is endless price hikes, weird efforts to nickel-and-dime users, lower-quality programming, annoying new consumer [&#8230;]

I think it best to start this post off with an admission: I had no idea that &#8220;broccolini&#8221; was not the name of an actual vegetable, but rather a trademarked brand name.
