Killer Klowns from Outer Space is the latest in the asymmetrical horror multiplayer survival genre that you should be intimately familiar with if you’ve ever played Dead by Daylight and its myriad imitators.

The humans can also fight back: crowbars, baseball bats, two-by-fours, knives, revolvers, and my personal favorite, shotguns are scattered around the map and yours for the taking, though you’ll have to work around ammo and item durability.
