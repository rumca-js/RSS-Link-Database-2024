## Liverpool and Elliott turn on style to dent Tottenham’s top-four hopes

<p>Tottenham were offered a route towards Champions League qualification but ignored the directions. Ange Postecoglou’s team were woeful as they succumbed to a fourth consecutive Premier League defeat that should extinguish their top four hopes as Liverpool rediscovered their verve in Jürgen Klopp’s penultimate home game. The scoreline flattered the conquered.</p><p>Liverpool cruised towards victory for 72 minutes until Spurs’ substitute Richarlison and captain Son Heung-min sparked a mini-crisis of confidence among Klopp’s team. It soon passed. For the second Sunday in succession Spurs came alive only when staring at a comprehensive pounding but, just like the north London derby, their late flurry fooled no-one. Liverpool were richly deserving of a win delivered by Mohamed Salah, Andy Robertson, Cody Gakpo and Harvey Elliott.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/may/05/liverpool-tottenham-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

The first was about a 13-year-old, the son of a friend, who said he had been rounded on for making a small (and, he thought, complimentary) comment about a girl’s haircut.</p><p>He told his mother that the girl’s friends were outraged: “Oh my God, you can’t say that about someone’s appearance.

Josh O’Connor, the 33-year-old British actor best known until, well, last week as the thin-skinned, tight-lipped Prince Charles in seasons three and four of <em>The Crown</em>, has been mulling over this question of late. Earlier this year he completed a drama set in the first world war called <em>The</em> <em>History of Sound</em>, with Paul Mescal. “Paul’s a friend, and to watch him work was amazing,” says O’Connor. “I really can’t underplay how brilliant he is. Paul has that movie-star quality, whatever that is. I wish I could articulate it, but he’s just graceful about it all.”</p><p>Zendaya is another one. O’Connor is currently in cinemas alongside her in <em>Challengers</em>, Luca Guadagnino’s critically acclaimed psychosexua
