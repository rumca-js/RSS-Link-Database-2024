<p>In our age of misinformation, this unsparing study of the many ways in which we can be deceived and how to counter the pernicious effects couldn’t be more timely</p><p>“What is truth, said jesting Pilate – and would not stay for an answer.” Thus philosopher Francis Bacon dramatised the opening of his famous Of Truth essay. Every human being alive, he thought, was prey to the bewitching temptation to disregard truth even to the point of deceiving ourselves, and to believe what it pleased us to believe – certainly disregarding truths put to us by others. In Pilate’s view, both Jesus Christ and the high priests urging his crucifixion were no more than partisans of their own particular truths – just like all of us. But, writing more than 400 years ago, Bacon thought that was not good enough. It was crucial, he said, to be honest and have shared truths, and for that he looked to the methodologies being pioneered by science. There were no partisan truths in nature – only immutable laws a

People feel victims of a terrible injustice</p><p>Late last Monday, I got home from a long day of political reporting to find a political leaflet produced by the Conservative party. It had nothing do with the local elections; where I live, the only contest was the rather underwhelming vote on a new police and crime commissioner. Instead, what it said looked ahead to the general election.</p><p>“Inflation down, wages up, taxes being cut – let’s stick with the plan that’s working,” it read. There were pithy paragraphs about “ensuring high-quality education and childcare for all children”, and “better transport for our community”.

And, as she’s discovered, it has many surprising benefits</p><p>Neither of us can remember exactly how it happened, but we both agree we were probably a little drunk. It was December 2016. We had been dating for eight months. Even with the booze we were, by many measures, still shy around each other, fearful of spoiling the magic. Which is why neither I nor my partner can fathom the conversation that landed us either in bed or on the sofa with him reading <em>A Christmas Carol</em> out loud to me for an hour. It wasn’t something either of us had ever done with another adult. It wasn’t something we’d heard of adults in the real world ever doing. But the book kept getting read – always by my boyfriend, out loud to me, who listened with total fixation. It was finished before we left to be with our respective families for the Christmas break.

Fourteen-year-old Zeina (Hala Zein) lives with her mother and father in Damascus; at the dogged insistence of her father, Mutaz (Samer Al Masri), who refuses to flee his home, they are one of the few remaining families in a devastated neighbourhood. Covert visits from a local boy offer Zeina glimpses of freedom outside the oppressive control of her father.

<p><strong>First Direct Arena, Leeds<br /></strong>TikTok phenomenon Somewhere Only We Know inspires much hugging and joy, but the band led by a revived Tom Chaplin are more than just a one-hit wonder</p><p>After the chart-steamrollering success of their 2004 debut album Hopes and Fears, singer Tom Chaplin’s marital breakdown and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/may/04/tom-chaplin-and-tim-rice-oxley-look-back-keane">drug and alcohol addiction</a> meant things had gone badly awry by the time Keane took an “indefinite hiatus” 10 years ago.

<p>The animals out-act the humans in this badly dubbed German addition to the series, which finds Lassie tackling a dognapping ring</p><p>Normally, the rudimentary dubbing of this German production into English would be a major stumbling block. However the performances are already so abysmal that the fact that no effort has been made to match voices to lip movements has little overall impact on the lamentable quality of the movie. In this latest outing for the resourceful collie (in this case dealing with a spate of thefts of pedigree woofers), the four-legged cast act circles around the humans. Even so, the appeal of the film, which feels like the Crufts canine agility competition with a bit of plot tacked on, will probably be limited to very young kids and fans of synthetically pretty alpine scenery.</p><p>In UK and Irish cinemas now</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/article/2024/may/05/lassie-a-new-adventure-review-like-crufts-with-a-bit-of-plot-tacked-on">Continue read

<p>Much art, from Bob Dylan to Robert Frank, derives its greatness from its flaws. But sporting perfection is a whole different ball game</p><p>I’m not one to boast but on a recent Sunday morning I achieved perfection. To be precise – and there is no perfection without precision – I was half of something perfectly achieved. On the second version of the song Love Sick – which only saw the light of day last year as part of the continuing series of official Bootleg releases – Bob Dylan says he’s “struggling, striving / For perfection”. Proof of the struggle and strife is the way that this declaration was absent from the first take and deleted from the subsequent version selected for the album <em>Time Out of Mind </em>(1997). Despite what he claims, Dylan is not – and never has been – interested in perfection. He’s always been plunging on to the next line, the next verse, the next song. Yes, he looks forward, in another song, to the day when he’ll paint his masterpiece but on several occ

And yet, a sign on the only paved road into town calls this the Home of Champions, owing to its phenomenal athletic success.

<p>There’s a great restaurant and bar scene in this surf mecca, plus birdlife and snorkelling on peaceful islands a short ride away</p><p></p><p>It was the small and enigmatic Berlengas archipelago that drew us to Peniche harbour. Peniche, 60 miles north of Lisbon, is famous for its surfing beaches, but the islands off its coast often get overlooked. Every morning a couple of hardy passenger boats bounce over eight miles of waves from the peninsula of Peniche to Berlenga Grande. We took our seats on deck between sacks of onions and oranges and, flecked with sea-spray and followed by flocks of screaming gulls, we watched green hills emerge from blue waves ahead. At the port, the goods are unloaded with gulls wheeling and cawing overhead.</p><p>Seabirds nest everywhere: in the island’s grass, its sea caves and its hidden coves. Keeping out of nesting areas, we followed a footpath to a pair of sandy beaches. The sea is warmer here than at the more open mainland stretches and, at Praia da

<p>An absorbing study of five Labour radicals – Jeremy Corbyn, Diane Abbott, John McDonnell, Ken Livingstone, plus Benn himself – makes a convincing case for their cultural victories but romanticises Corbyn’s years as the party’s leader</p><p>This might seem like an eccentric book. As Labour prepares for power after four consecutive general election defeats, Andy Beckett is interested not in what is to come but what has just been. He is particularly preoccupied by the rise of Jeremy Corbyn, what happened to him as party leader and what his leadership represented. <em>The </em><em>Searchers</em> is mostly fair-minded, diligently reported and researched, but leaves you in no doubt that Beckett, a <em>Guardian</em> columnist, is a sympathetic Corbynite.</p><p>In the long, final section, covering 2015 to the present day, Beckett writes nostalgically about the excitement of the early years of Corbyn’s leadership when the left, for so long ridiculed, traduced and marginalised (Peter Mandels

<p>Think you don’t need sunscreen? Think again – and the new versions are easy to wear</p><p>By chance I chatted with three different people in quick succession who all went on (separate) holidays and all got sunburnt. One said she never wears sunscreen at home, would normally while away but seeing as she was swimming, she didn’t think it mattered. The second person hated sunscreen because: “It is just so thick and sludgy and leaves a white cast.” Then there was the one who just doesn’t bother because they feel it interferes with them getting a tan. The misinformation around SPF gives me a headache but here goes, again. Unless you live in a house with no windows, you need sunscreen all year round. Formulations have changed so the dense, white-casting iterations are less of a thing – most mimic the texture and the results of great skincare. The sun is your “frenemy”. It’s a glorious source of vitamin D, aka your friend. But it is also your enemy as it damages your skin. There is nothin

The country’s wines have, in fact, long been sommelier favourites, thanks, I think, to their ability to combine freshness and ripeness. Certainly, when it comes to Austria’s signature white grape variety, grüner veltliner, there’s no lack of aromatic fleshy fruit flavour of the sort that drinkers reared on, say, New Zealand sauvignon blanc, might enjoy.
