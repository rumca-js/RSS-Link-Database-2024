Dave Rubin of “The Rubin Report” talks to Tulsi Gabbard about her book “For Love of Country”; the cost of leaving the Democratic Party; her efforts to reform the party; how she became a victim of dirty attacks from Democratic elites like Hillary Clinton; Biden's missed opportunities for unity and the party's shift toward extreme ideologies; how Democratic policies are undermining American values and why they aren’t a result of incompetence; why Democrats are allowing the border crisis to spiral out of control; the response to her book; if disenfranchised Democrats are considering voting Republican or for Robert F. Kennedy Jr.; the urgency of voting against Democrats to prevent further decline; why the GOP needs to embrace a big-tent approach and focus on shared American values; the choice independent voters face in 2024; how she would respond if Donald Trump asked her to be his vice president; her transformative journey and spiritual growth outside of politics; bipartisan friendships
