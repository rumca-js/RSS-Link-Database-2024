Sir Alexander Dane: Where's the happy ending, Jason? "Never give up, never surrender?"
Jason Nesmith: [Using the opportunity to provoke a fake fight] Maybe it's about time you just backed off, you fin-headed monstrosity.
Sir Alexander Dane: You what?
Jason Nesmith: You're starting to act just like to did in Episode 17, you scene-stealing hack!
Sir Alexander Dane: [Finally catching on] Oh! Right! Well, how does it feel, Jason? Was it worth it? You've murdered us all!
Jason Nesmith: Shut up.
Sir Alexander Dane: Hundreds to die, just because of you!
Jason Nesmith: I told you to shut up!
