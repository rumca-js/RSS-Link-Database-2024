Currently I'm using an old gaming PC I've bought of a friend. It has a i5-9400f and about 40gb of ram (yes know that, that \u0130s a weird combination but that is the ram that had lieing around).</p> <p>I want to be able to host multiple servers simultaneously on it. Let's say about 2 Minecraft servers, a SkyBlock and a vanilla server. Also it should be able to run other game servers like satisfactory, valheim, terraria, palworld, etc. but those will not be running all the time. Those will only run on their own with the Minecraft servers. </p> <p>Basically I am wondering is it worth the investment to buy a new system, that is dedicated to host the game servers, should I upgrade the current system or is this system already good enough?
