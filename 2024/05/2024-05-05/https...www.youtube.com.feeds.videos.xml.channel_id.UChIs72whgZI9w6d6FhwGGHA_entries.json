We're focusing our efforts entirely on coldplate shape today to isolate variables -- maybe we can bin heatpipes in the future. This uses a 3D laser scanner to evaluate the surface curvature of an Intel and AMD IHS (Integrated Heat Spreader) when clamped under the ILM (Independent Loading Mechanism) force for the CPU socket. It's an engineering experiment for fun with some science mixed in, but maybe this can help guide CPU cooler design in the future. For this testing, we're using the Scythe FUMA 3 air coolers (successor to the fam", "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BMYsMGpyFY", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UChIs72whgZI9w6d6FhwGGHA", "source_obj__id": 428, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/7BMYsMGpyFY/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "We Made the Perfect CPU Cooler | Intel vs. AMD Curvature & Coldplate Engineering", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
