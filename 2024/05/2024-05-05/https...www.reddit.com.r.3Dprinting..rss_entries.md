<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I'm a totally blind, super tech nerd and have been intrigued by the idea of 3D printing for years, but I've finally decided to really get into it. </p> <p>I'm not going to explain how I do things just yet, because other fellow blind people have come before me and already done that. What I am looking for, though, is which 3D printers have actual physical buttons, switches and knobs, not the touch-screen panel. I won't make my decision on which one to purchase based on this, alone, but it is a requirement, so being able to build a list of which ones fit this criteria will help me filter through the MANY available options.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/anonymombie"> /u/anonymombie </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/1cki9cw/which_3d_printers_have_physical_buttons/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/1cki9cw/which_3
