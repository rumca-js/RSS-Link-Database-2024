The collection has been available on PC via Epic for some time, but c'mon, if you want to go to where the PC gamers are, you have to be on Steam.

In other news, Nintendo has acquired Shiver Entertainment, a studio that has handled a few high-profile Switch ports, to varying degrees of success. Their Mortal Kombat 11 and Hogwarts Legacy ports were generally considered to be pretty good, but then there's Mortal Kombat 1...yikes. And finally, another big Xbox exclusive has launched with Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2. Although the game just came out, Microsoft is happy enough that they've commissioned a new game from developer Ninja Theory, so it looks like that studio won't be closing down any", "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHYsXs5YHU4", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "source_obj__id": 149, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/KHYsXs5YHU4/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Kingdom Hearts Is Finally on Steam - IGN Daily Fix", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-05-21T22:00:00+00:00", "description": "Join members of the development team for a deep dive into the world of Ingris and the story of The First Descendant in this behind-the-scenes look at the upcoming third-person co-op action RPG looter shooter.

Also available on Xbox Series S and PC.\n\n\"Senua\u2019s Saga: Hellblade 2 delivers a spellbinding adventure packed with cinematic spectacle and story surprises that maintains a surging sense of forward momentum and never wastes a second of its slender run time. Its combat manages to feel consistently intimidating and immediate despite its mechanical simplicity, and its perspective-based puzzles regularly scratch cerebral itches even though they largely rehash or rework concepts from Senua\u2019s previous story. A journey as brutal as it is beautiful delivered with hardware-pushing visuals and persistently absorbing audio, Senua\u2019s Saga: Hellblade 2 is another Viking-worthy feast for the senses that meets the high bar set by its predecessor, even if it never really manages to clear it.\"", "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKWTioa8BcY", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "source_obj__id": 149, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/zKWTioa8BcY/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 Review", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-05-21T08:00:20+00:00", "description": "Check out the gorgeous opening moments of Ninja Theory's long-anticipated Hellblade II, captured using a PC equipped with a GeForce RTX 4090 at full 4K 60fps at max graphics settings.", "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpX39HY7ujI", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "source_obj__id": 149, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/fpX39HY7ujI/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 - The First 20 Minutes of Gameplay | 4K 60FPS PC Gameplay", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-05-21T02:00:02+00:00", "description": "Watch the latest Minecraft trailer for a peek at the free anniversary map by Oreville Studios, available now.
