Volcanoes represent a primary natural source of Hg in the atmosphere, with significant effects on Hg cycles on both global and regional scales. Mercury can undergo both mass-dependent fractionation (MDF) and mass-independent fractionation (MIF) in Earth systems.

Researchers at the University of Sydney have revealed how our oyster reefs can provide lessons on reef restoration projects. More than 85% of naturally occurring oyster reefs have been lost in recent decades due to disease, overharvesting, global warming and pollution. Three reefs that have maintained their oyster populations naturally are in New South Wales, Australia: Gamay (Botany Bay), Port Hacking and Crookhaven (on the Shoalhaven).

The response of runoff from inland river basins is becoming increasingly complex due to climate change and intensification of human activities, as well as underlying surface impacts. The annual distribution pattern of runoff shows spatio-temporal heterogeneity, which affects hydropower generation, irrigation, ecological-cultural value of river runoff, and puts pressure on water resource management projects.
