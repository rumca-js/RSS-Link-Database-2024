However, in the PS3 era, it was all about Naughty Dog's Uncharted series.\n\nComing off of the Jak and Daxter series, the developer presented more realistic visuals and action-platforming alongside a charismatic new hero in Nathan Drake. Suffice it to say that the series was a success, with it selling millions of copies and earning significant critical praise.\n\nThough Drake's story concluded in Uncharted 4: A Thief's End, there have been reports and rumors of new games, whether it's a reboot or remake. Is Uncharted 5 happening at any point, or does Sony have something else in mind for the franchise?", "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTgs-TlNdpY", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "source_obj__id": 129, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/PTgs-TlNdpY/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Where The Heck Is UNCHARTED 5?", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-05-21T14:30:18+00:00", "description": "Ninja Theory has delivered an excellent sequel with Senua\u2019s Saga: Hellblade 2 which feels like a major improvement in almost every conceivable way.
