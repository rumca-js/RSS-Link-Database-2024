<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-10-02-super-mario-maker-crushed-my-dreams-of-making-video-games.html"><em><ins>Super Mario Maker</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/super-mario-maker-2/"><ins>its sequel</ins></a> are terrific games that let fans create and share their own Mario levels with ease. But it was a bit of a disappointment that Nintendo only factored in the 2D Mario games. None of the plumber's 3D incarnations have made it to a Mario Maker title to date. So thank goodness for modders.</p>
<p>A pair of modders named Arthurtilly and Rovertronic have released an <a href="https://romhacking.com/hack/mario-builder-64"><ins>open-source </ins><em><ins>Super Mario 64</ins></em><ins> mod</ins></a> that aims to make it a cinch for players to create and share their own levels.

<p>The US Department of Justice arrested a Wisconsin man last week for generating and distributing AI-generated child sexual abuse material (CSAM). As far as we know, this is the first case of its kind as the DOJ looks to establish a judicial precedent that exploitative materials are still illegal even when no children were used to create them. “Put simply, CSAM generated by AI is still CSAM,” Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/man-arrested-producing-distributing-and-possessing-ai-generated-images-minors-engaged">wrote</a> in a press release.</p>
<p>The DOJ says 42-year-old software engineer Steven Anderegg of Holmen, WI, used a fork of the open-source AI image generator <a href="https://www.engadget.com/stable-diffusion-3-is-a-new-ai-image-generator-that-wont-mess-up-text-in-pictures-its-makers-claim-233751335.html">Stable Diffusion</a> to make the images, which he then used to try to lure an underage boy into sexual

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/pixar/"><ins>Pixar</ins></a> is losing around 175 of its workers amid a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/disney/"><ins>Disney</ins></a> cost-cutting drive. It was reported as far back as January that layoffs were planned for the digital animation pioneer and the studio's headcount is being reduced by around 14 percent.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/article/2024/may/21/disney-pixar-layoffs"><em><ins>The Guardian</ins></em></a>, the downsizing is part of moves to scale back on development of original shows and movies for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/disney-plus/"><ins>Disney+</ins></a> as the company tries to make its streaming division <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-will-start-showing-some-live-sports-from-espn-this-year-173524610.html3">more profitable</a>. As such, Pixar is expected to once again focus entirely on making theatrical feature films.</p>

The new tool was designed to take on time-consuming tasks to free up personnel, such as managing meeting agenda and taking down minutes that group members can tweak as needed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new Copilot for Teams can also serve as a meeting moderator by summarizing important information for latecomers (or for reference after the fact) and answering questions. Finally, it can create and assign tasks in Planner, track their deadlines, and notify

## Paper Mario The Thousand-Year Door review: A Switch remake (mostly) befitting a masterpiece

<p>It’s criminal that there’s been no way to play <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em> for over a decade. The only way to experience the original 2004 Gamecube title was on that console or the Wii, which thankfully supported Gamecube discs (something that feels like a genuine miracle now). There was no Gamecube hardware support on the Wii U, unfortunately, and <em>The Thousand-Year Door</em> never popped up on its online store. So here we are, 20 years later, with a complete remake for the Switch. It’s fantastic, befitting a game that was already a masterpiece — it’s just a shame that Nintendo took so long to revisit the game.</p>
<p>Here’s some sobering perspective: I first played through <em>The Thousand-Year Door</em> as a senior in college, where my roommates and I made it a communal adventure. Now I’m married with two kids but I still lament the loss of Gamecube titles almost daily. Where’s <em>Eternal Darkness</em>, one of the best horror games ever made? Where’s <em>Ski

As the name indicates, Generative Remove lets you get rid of any unwanted objects from a photo and then creates &quot;pixel perfect generations&quot; that make it seem as if nothing was ever there. These items could be anything from an ugly trash can in a beautiful photo or a lamp post that blocks an otherwise clear skyline.

<p>If you have yet to hop on the air fry bandwagon, it’s not a bad time to do so. Like the ubiquitous <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instant-pot-guide-131534709.html">Instant Pot</a>, air fryers are small appliances that don’t cost an arm and a leg that can be useful additions to your kitchen. While they excel at making things super crispy without excess oil, many of them are true multi-cookers with different cooking modes like bake, broil and dehydrate. Regardless of if you get a traditional pod-style air fryer or a larger air fryer toaster oven machine, there’s a good chance you’ll be able to use your new appliance for more than just crisping up chicken or french fries. And in warmer weather, they’re much easier to operate than a standard oven and won’t make your home as stifling. If you’re unsure where to start in your search for the best air fryer for you, Engadget can help. We’ve detailed our top picks below, along with buying advice that will help you decide which air fryer m

<p>Cable’s deserved reputation for being tough to cancel is partly what makes streaming such a compelling alternative. In fact, the FTC held an <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/ftc-negative-option-rule-informal-hearing-transcript-1.16.24.pdf">informal hearing</a> in January about its proposed “<a href="https://www.engadget.com/ftc-wants-to-make-it-easier-for-you-to-cancel-subscriptions-142649542.html">click to cancel</a>” rules, which would compel subscription providers like cable companies to make it simpler for people to end their service. During the hearing, industry representatives claimed making canceling easier for customers would just “<a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/01/cable-firms-to-ftc-we-shouldnt-have-to-let-users-cancel-service-with-a-click/">confuse them</a>.” There’s a lot of entertainment, news and sports sequestered behind cable’s pay wall, and a live TV streaming service is the best way to get around that.

<p>Whether you have an older Xbox One or a brand new Xbox Series X, you have access to an almost-identical library of games. That’s a good thing for gamers, but it makes it harder for people like us to maintain favorites lists that vary by console — at least for now. With this list of best Xbox games, we wanted to highlight the best games we would recommend to someone picking up an Xbox today — whether it’s the best Xbox One games or the top picks for a Series X, a Series S or One S. The result is a list that is a mixture of games exclusive to Microsoft’s consoles and cross-platform showstoppers that play best on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/">Xbox</a>. We’ve done our best to explain the benefits Microsoft’s systems bring to the table where appropriate. Oh, and while we understand some may have an aversion to subscription services, it’s definitely worth considering <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=67071605-d4df-494e-8d9c-c
