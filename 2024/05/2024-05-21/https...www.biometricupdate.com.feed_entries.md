		The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network’s (FinCEN) says the rules for financial institutions onboarding U.S. customers to open accounts need to be improved to strengthen anti-money-laundering (AML) and countering the financing of terrorism (CFT) regulation. <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/03/29/2024-06763/request-for-information-and-comment-on-customer-identification-program-rule-taxpayer-identification" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Brookings Institution says</a> FinCEN should shift its focus away from prescriptive advice about how to collect AML and CFT information, and towards the adoption of digital identity.

		There is significant progress in the implementation of legal and digital identity systems in Africa, but there is a barrage of challenges still to deal with.

This is the summation of the collective observations and insights from government representatives of ID authorities on the first day of the <a href="https://id4africaevents.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">2024 ID4Africa</a> annual general assembly, which is underway in Cape Town.

From Ethiopia to South Africa, Nigeria to Rwanda, and in between, representatives of ID-issuing authorities in seven countries with promising stories on digital ID had the chance to explain their identity journeys, so they can serve as an inspiration for digital systems being built in other parts of the continent.

		A government committee in the United Kingdom is calling for the rollout of the European Union’s biometric-based travel schemes to be delayed, saying that the timetable for introducing changes at the border is “extremely ambitious.” At the same time, the government needs to prioritize border upgrades and communication with the public about them, the committee says.

The Lords Justice and Home Affairs Committee made the call at the conclusion of an inquiry into the electronic border systems. The agency warns that unless the government acts quickly, a “major travel disruption” could befall the country.

The UK is currently implementing three new travel regimes: the EU’s Entry-Exit System and the Electronic Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS) as well a
