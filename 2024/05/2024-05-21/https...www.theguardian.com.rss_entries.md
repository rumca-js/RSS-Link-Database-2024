Would the director Maria Fredriksson like to make a film about their wonderful story?

<p>Although couples love banning phone pictures on their big day, there’s joy in taking amateur snaps</p><p>The first time I attended a friend’s wedding was in spring 2007, a month and a half before the first iPhone went on sale. I was still in college at the time, and I remember being blown away by how few concessions the DJ made to the older relatives in attendance; the first dance was to a Neutral Milk Hotel song (wouldn’t have been my choice, but it was a memorable one). But I have no record of that first dance, just an increasingly hazy memory. In fact, I have very few photos from the event – maybe one or two that someone tagged me in on Facebook.</p><p>Since then, chronicling a wedding from every angle has become not just something professionals do, but guests as well. We all have the capacity to capture every moment, and often through clever, but not quite-as-clever-as-you-think wedding hashtags (I include my own in this indictment), we are willingly deputized as photographers.

<p>Who will be the next president isn’t clear. But the regime is unlikely to extend its hand to anyone but ultra-loyalists</p><p>The death of the Iranian president, Ebrahim Raisi, in a helicopter crash on Sunday night immediately set off speculation about the succession of the next supreme leader. Raisi was widely considered to be a leading candidate to replace Ali Khamenei, who is in his mid-80s and reportedly in poor health. His departure from the pool of possible candidates has raised the question of whether this could be an opportunity for the Iranian regime to widen political participation in the country by reinstating moderates and reformist figures into some state functions.</p><p>But this is unlikely. Over the past few years, the inner circle of the regime in Iran has been shrinking and will continue to do so.

Last week, CNN released surveillance footage of an attack by Sean Combs, the rapper and producer, against his ex-partner, the singer Cassie Ventura, at a Los Angeles hotel in 2016. In the footage, shot in a hotel hallway and at an elevator landing, Ventura, in a hoodie, tries to flee the hotel room she was sharing with Combs. She appears to be in a rush – she has bags of her things, and when she reaches the elevator bank, she’s still trying to put on her shoes. She’s just moments from getting away. But Combs, naked save for a towel, marches down the hallway and finds her. He throws Ventura to the ground and begins kicking her. Later, he corners her and pelts a vase at her. The video ends when Combs drags Ventura, still on the ground, down the hallway, back to their hotel roo

<p>An entire generation nurses fond nostalgic memories of the gaudy kids’ game that came packed in with Windows Vista. But who actually made it?</p><p>If you had a PC in the 2010s, you probably owned a copy of Purble Place. The gaudy kids’ game came with every copy of Windows Vista and 7. It was a simple, three-title package: Purble Pairs was a basic tile memory game; Purble Shop had the player design a mystery character using logic and deduction; and the last game of Comfy Cakes had kids playing line cook for the Purble Chef while juggling orders on a conveyor belt. And for many online teens, the legacy of these games easily equals that of Minesweeper and Solitaire, the more venerable pack-in games of PCs past.</p><p>Yet nobody knows who made it. Curious players noted a simple credit to Oberon Games in the game’s help menu, but that’s all. Despite being installed on hundreds of millions of computers worldwide, the actual creators of the game have lived in obscurity for two decades.</

<p>Ali Abbasi spoke at Cannes about his controversial new film, which the Trump campaign has said ‘belongs in a dumpster fire’</p><p>The protagonist of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/article/2024/may/20/the-apprentice-review-cartoon-version-of-chump-in-chief-donald-trumps-early-years">The Apprentice</a> is a bully and a liar, a conman and a rapist. He rejects his sick brother, sexually assaults his doting wife and cuts a deal with the mafia in order to build a skyscraper. It’s safe to assume that followers of Donald Trump won’t relish the portrayal of their hero in Ali Abbasi’s new film. As for Trump himself, though, the director suspects that he might quite enjoy it.</p><p>“I don’t think it is a movie he would dislike,” said Abbasi after The Apprentice premiered at the Cannes film festival. “I don’t necessarily think he would like it, but I think he’d be surprised. So I’m happy to meet him, have a screening and then we can discuss it afterwards.”</p> <a href="https://www.t

It tells the story of Elena (Greta Grinevičiūtė), a contemporary dancer leading a workshop for deaf teenagers, who falls for sign language interpreter Dovydas (Kęstutis Cicėnas).

Even without those moth-eaten stars-and-stripes, it would be clear that what unfolds in this bare-bones domestic dive, with its sofa, fridge and sink, is a metaphor for a divided country.</p><p>Each character in this three-hander has a private space in which to spiral off into delusional monologues.

Child E was giving evidence of how Neil Foden would take her on trips to Liverpool, pulling over in <a href="https://www.itv.com/news/wales/2024-04-29/headteacher-took-child-to-country-lane-for-sex-court-hears">country lanes</a> on the way back so that he could have sex with her. When the defence suggested that the purpose of these detours was so that he could recce new routes for country walks, she laughed.</p><p>Why did reading about the laugh get to me so much? I think it was because it implied a tragic worldliness. The loss of childhood innocence. Children should not be laughing, seemingly bitterly and cynically, about the sexual proclivities

<p>Isla Fisher and Greg Kinnear are wasted as a mother and father heading for a breakup – until their kids find a clock that turns back time</p><p>A mashup of Groundhog Day, Back to the Future and The Parent Trap, this wholesome PG comedy gets its narrative engine running when Taylor (Easton Rocket Sweda), one of three siblings in a suburban American family, discovers that he can make time run backwards, going as far as 12 hours into the past. All he has to do is physically move the hands of an heirloom upright clock, and with a little old-fashioned camera trickery and some off-the-software-shelf visual effects and bog-standard editing, everything resets. This proves useful because his parents – mum Jen (Isla Fisher) and dad Eric (Greg Kinnear) – are on a path towards separation, which they hope to announce at a family dinner that evening. So Taylor, who is electively mute, hates to be touched and is schooled at home, keeps running back the clock after trying to make tweaks to the par

They’re now being allowed to tell their own stories – even if it’s after death</p><p>In a 2008 interview, Anita Pallenberg swore she would never write her autobiography. The artist, model and actor was weary of publishers who only wanted to read about her intimate dealings with the Rolling Stones – she dated both Brian Jones and Keith Richards, and had an affair with Mick Jagger. “They all wanted salacious,” she said then. “And everybody is writing autobiographies and that’s one reason why I’m not going to do it.”</p><p>Yet when Pallenberg died in 2017, she left behind pages of a neatly typed manuscript, titled Black Magic, that contained her life story. True to form, she characterised these memoirs as “memory images, a traveller’s tale through a landscape of dreams and shadows” rather than an autobiography. But she held little back while chronicling her spirited and frequent

<p>Oleksandr Usyk’s scrap with Tyson Fury in Saudi Arabia upheld the sport’s time-honoured tradition of sportswashing</p><p>I bought the fight. Obviously I bought the fight. It cost £24.95, money that was previously sitting in my “ethical” bank account until I decided to exchange it for the privilege of watching two men hit each other in the face live from Saudi Arabia. I tell you this so you can be assured that what follows comes from no place of sanctimony or moral purity or even intellectual coherence. Cuff me. Haul me in. What is the charge? Enjoying a fight?

<p>At AZ and Feyenoord I encountered a coach who was tactically sharp, an exceptional analyst and an astute man-manager</p><p>I was playing at FC Groningen when my teammate Etiënne Reijnen told me: “I’ve been called by my former teammate Arne, who was asking about you; how you are as a player and person.” That was my introduction to Arne Slot. He was assistant at AZ and I was told he was a very good coach. Soon after, I moved there and got to know him as a very tactical and knowledgable coach, who took a genuine interest in you as a human being as well.</p><p>As an assistant he did the tactical team talks and analysis of training sessions and he was very detailed, providing solutions to game situations while working on it in training. He motivated me every day to become a better player, to have a bigger goal in mind and to work very hard for that.
