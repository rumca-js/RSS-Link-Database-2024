Today on the Matt Walsh Show, yesterday, the Left celebrated the sacred holiday of Michael Brown's birthday. Ten years later, they are still pushing their narrative about the Michael Brown case, regardless of how thoroughly it has been proven false. Plus, a major scandal surrounding Justice Samuel Alito. I've read about the scandal and I'm still not sure what the scandal is supposed to be, exactly. We'll try to get to the bottom of it. CNN invites a random rapper on air to talk about the Sean Combs case. Hilarity ensues. And my feud with the nation of Australia has now reached a boiling point. Is war on the horizon?
