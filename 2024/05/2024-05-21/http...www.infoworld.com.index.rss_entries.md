<p>Microsoft has been polishing up its AI-powered Copilot for Azure for months now, and finally decided it’s ready for everyone to use. A public preview of Copilot for Azure will roll out relatively quickly, over a couple of weeks. If you’re not able to access Copilot for Azure immediately, rest assured you should see it in your Azure Portal soon, where it can help you manage, secure, and tune your Azure cloud infrastructure.</p><p>I talked with Erin Chapple, Microsoft CVP, Azure Core Product and Design, about the new service and where it’s likely to go in the future. Like Microsoft’s other service-oriented Copilots, Copilot for Azure isn’t the general-purpose Copilot you’ll find in Bing. Instead, think of Copilot for Azure as a natural language interface to Azure services that can work directly with the Azure Resource Graph and Azure APIs, while retaining context between queries.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3715484/microsoft-azure-copilot

<p>It’s Monday. You come into the office only to be met with a dozen emails from your system development teammates requesting to speak with you right away. It seems that the generative AI-enabled inventory management system you launched a week ago is frustrating its new users. It’s taking minutes, not seconds to respond. Shipments are now running late. Customers are hanging up on your service reps because they are taking too long to answer customer questions. Website sales are down by 20% due to performance lags. Whoops. You have a performance problem.</p><p>But you did everything right. You’re using only GPUs for processing training and inferences; you did all recommended performance testing; you have over-provisioned the memory space, and you are only using the fastest storage with the best I/O performance. Indeed, your cloud bill is greater than $100K a month. How can performance be failing?</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3715432/how-to-im
