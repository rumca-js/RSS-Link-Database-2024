Copper is one of several companies affected by an ongoing fiasco at Synapse, which filed for bankruptcy last month. The company, which acts as a &#8220;middleware provider&#8221; between fintech startups and banks, was set to be acquired by TabaPay but TechCrunch reported that the deal fell through earlier this month. Customers of Yotta Technologies and Juno Finance are also locked out of deposit accounts, Forbes reported Tuesday.

Wave Motion&#8217;s Jet Gun concept involves firing a jet of supersonic gas to push a projectile to high speeds. Since there&#8217;s no physical structure or barrel surrounding the projectile, the system has the potential to be up to 100 times more compact than a rocket or conventional cannon of equivalent power. Also, the barrel-less launcher can handle projectiles in a variety of sizes &#8212; which gives the Jet Gun an advantage in logistically challenged&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/army-award-wave-motion-jet-gun/">Read More</a>
