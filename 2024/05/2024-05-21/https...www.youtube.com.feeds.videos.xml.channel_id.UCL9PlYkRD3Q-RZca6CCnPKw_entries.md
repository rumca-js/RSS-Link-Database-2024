A current White House official on staff with the National Security Council stated in a Project Veritas undercover recording that President Joe Biden is waiting for a second term to condemn Israel‚Äôs actions in Gaza but can‚Äôt say so due to ‚Äòpowerful Jewish influences‚Äô that could cost him the election.

During the six-minute recording, Waters discusses internal White House deliberations about the ongoing conflict in Gaza and admits that ‚Äúif Biden won again he could be much more forthright about saying ‚ÄòNo‚Äô [to Israel],‚Äù stating that the administration would have more freedom to tell Israel ‚Äòyou‚Äôre not going to continue to lie, and bomb, and kill all these kids without facing serious consequences.‚Äô‚Äù
