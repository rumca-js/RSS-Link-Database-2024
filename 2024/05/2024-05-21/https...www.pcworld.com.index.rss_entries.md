<p>If you&rsquo;ve been wondering why you&rsquo;ve never seen a Surface gaming laptop, don&rsquo;t blame Microsoft.</p>



<p>For years, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2339110/hands-on-surface-laptops-benefits-are-on-the-inside.html">Microsoft&rsquo;s Surface has led the way</a> in certain product categories, including tablets and the pull-forward design of the Surface Laptop Studio.
