<p>So far, <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/1629974/m365-copilot-microsofts-generative-ai-tool-explained.html">Microsoft’s 365 Copilot</a> has mainly been positioned as a personal assistant for individual workers, helping them draft emails or recap meetings they might have missed. With the upcoming launch of Team Copilot, Microsoft wants to make its generative AI (genAI) assistant accessible in group settings, helping enable video meetings and coordinating team projects. </p>



<p>“Microsoft Team Copilot makes a great deal of sense as the next step in equipping the workforce with AI-based tools,” said J.P. Gownder, a vice president and principal analyst at Forrester Research. “We kno

<p>Microsoft is bringing a new AI-powered search function to Windows 11 that lets users find and retrieve information across any app they’ve accessed. </p>



<p>The new feature, Windows Recall, essentially records all user actions on a PC, taking snapshots of the screen at 5 second intervals. This allows Recall to generate a searchable timeline of everything they’ve interacted with, whether that’s an application, website, document, image, or anything else. It could mean searching for anything from references to a work-related topic across different documents, or a conversation with a friend on a chat app, whether on a desktop app or via a web browser. </p>

<p>Adobe is bringing Firefly features to Lightroom for the first time with the addition of Generative Remove.<br /><br />Adobe has been busy adding Firefly features to its various apps over the past year, including Photoshop and Premiere Pro; now it’s Lightroom’s turn.</p>



<p>Lightroom is Adobe’s app for organizing and processing photographs.<br /><br />As with the similar Generative Fill feature in Photoshop, Generative Remove lets users remove unwanted elements of a photo —  wrinkles on a tablecloth in food photography, for example, or distractions in holiday photos — by selecting them and deleting. It does this non-destructively, meaning any changes can be reversed. </p>

They will. But will they change it for the better? That’s another question.</p>



<p>I’ve been playing with both tools (and other genAI programs, as well). I’ve found they’re still prone to hallucinations, but sound more convincing than ever. That’s not a good thing.</p>
