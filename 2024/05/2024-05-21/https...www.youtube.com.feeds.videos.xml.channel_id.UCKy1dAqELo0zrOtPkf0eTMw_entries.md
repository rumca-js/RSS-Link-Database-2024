In today's Daily Fix:
Square Enix is following up on their reported strategy to go mutliplatform by dropping all of the console Kingdom Hearts games onto Steam. The collection has been available on PC via Epic for some time, but c'mon, if you want to go to where the PC gamers are, you have to be on Steam. Anyway this is great news for PC players who have yet to experience Square Enix's popular and long-running Disney crossover action-RPG series. In other news, Nintendo has acquired Shiver Entertainment, a studio that has handled a few high-profile Switch ports, to varying degrees of success. Their Mortal Kombat 11 and Hogwarts Legacy ports were generally considered to be pretty good, but then there's Mortal Kombat 1...yikes. And finally, another big Xbox exclusive has launched with Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2. Although the game just came out, Microsoft is happy enough that they've commissioned a new game from developer Ninja Theory, so it looks like that studio won't be closing down any

The Mad Max universe is full of crazy characters. The post-apocalyptic world created by director George Miller may be a hostile and dead landscape, but ironically enough it‚Äôs fertile ground for the creation of shocking savages, gross grease monkeys, saintly saviors, and all manner of rocking road warriors. And in the latest film in the series, Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga, Miller explores what can make ‚Äì and break ‚Äì such figures. Indeed, sometimes what breaks them is also what makes them in this universe.

With Furiosa, the filmmaker has created an origin story for the title character, played this time around by Anya Taylor-Joy. The film also explores how a bad guy might be born in this harsh future world, via Chris Hemworth‚Äôs charismatic crank, Dementus.

While the Furiosa character debuted in Mad Max: Fury Road in 2015, and was played by Charlize Theron in that film, the prequel explores her life from the time that she‚Äôs abducted from her family in the Green Place of Many Mothers through

Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 reviewed by Tristan Ogilvie on Xbox Series X. Also available on Xbox Series S and PC.

"Senua‚Äôs Saga: Hellblade 2 delivers a spellbinding adventure packed with cinematic spectacle and story surprises that maintains a surging sense of forward momentum and never wastes a second of its slender run time. Its combat manages to feel consistently intimidating and immediate despite its mechanical simplicity, and its perspective-based puzzles regularly scratch cerebral itches even though they largely rehash or rework concepts from Senua‚Äôs previous story. A journey as brutal as it is beautiful delivered with hardware-pushing visuals and persistently absorbing audio, Senua‚Äôs Saga: Hellblade 2 is another Viking-worthy feast for the senses that meets the high bar set by its predecessor, even if it never really manages to clear it."
