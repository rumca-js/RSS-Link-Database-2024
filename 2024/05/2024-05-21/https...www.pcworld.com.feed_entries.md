<p>PowerToys, the free suite of Microsoft user tools, has added a subtly powerful feature: Advanced Paste, which applies AI to a group of data that you&rsquo;ve cut or copied, or wish to paste elsewhere.</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s a weird but surprisingly cool concept, geared toward developers but with applications in a variety of different areas. </p>



<p>In 2023, we listed all of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/563788/seven-ways-in-which-microsofts-powertoys-improves-my-life.html">various tools within PowerToys</a>: from FancyZones to Image Resizer to a suite of Mouse Utilities, plus a lot more. Microsoft provides PowerToys as an installer, with the ability to download and run any of the apps you want.</p>



<p>Now you can add Advanced Paste to the list. &ldquo;Its goal is to let you paste your clipboard content in any format you&rsquo;d like, and can ev

<p>In 2023, Microsoft was a big believer in large language models, running in the cloud. At Microsoft Build, the company launched Phi Silica, a small language model designed to run specifically on the NPUs in new Copilot+ PCs.</p>



<p>In April, Microsoft announced <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2312816/copilot-running-on-your-pc-microsofts-new-ai-could-be-the-key.html">Phi-3-mini</a>, a model small enough to run on a local PC. Phi Silica is a derivative of Phi-3-mini, designed specifically to run on the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2337930/meet-the-future-of-windows-copilot-pcs-feature-practical-ai-tools.html">Copilot+ PCs</a> that Microsoft announced Monday. </p>

Lucky for you, we&rsquo;ve done the testing and can offer some sure-fire recommendations that are guaranteed to help, and not hinder, your gaming setup.</p>



<p><strong>Why you should trust us:</strong> We are PCWorld. Our reviewers have been putting computer hardware through its paces for decades.

<p>If you&rsquo;re like me and you spend all day in front of a keyboard, a regular full-height keyboard probably doesn&rsquo;t cut it&mdash;and that&rsquo;s why the <strong>Logitech K585</strong> should pique your interest.</p>



<p>This wireless keyboard&rsquo;s slim profile, silent typing, multi-device pairing, and wide compatibility are all standout features. The fact that <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Multi-Device-Wireless-Smartphone-Bluetooth/dp/B0BL2ND2GC&amp;xcust=2-1-2339706-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">it&rsquo;s currently on sale for just $31 (down from its listed price of $50)</a> makes it an even more compelling option.</p>

<p>If you use the Microsoft Edge browser at work, your days of texting a screenshot of a web page to your spouse or coworker are nearly over. Microsoft is adding screenshot prevention controls to Edge.</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s all designed to prevent you from sharing screenshots with competitors, relatives, and journalists using Microsoft Edge for Business. &ldquo;Screenshot prevention policies will secure against data exfiltration in the browser by blocking the ability to take screenshots on pages labeled as sensitive or protected,&rdquo; Microsoft said.</p>



<p>Specifically, IT managers at corporations will be able to tag web pages as protected, as defined in various Microsoft policy engines in Microsoft 365, Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps, Microsoft Intune Mobile Application Management and Microsoft Purview, Microsoft said. The screenshot prevention feature will

<p>Microsoft is planning to either add subtitles or even dub video produced by major video sites, using AI to translate the audio into foreign languages within Microsoft Edge in real time. </p>



<p>At its Microsoft Build developer conference, Microsoft named several sites that would benefit from the new real-time translation capabilities within Edge, including Reuters, CNBC News, Bloomberg, and Coursera, plus Microsoft&rsquo;s own LinkedIn. </p>



<p>Interestingly, Microsoft also named Google&rsquo;s YouTube as a beneficiary of the translation capabilities. (That&rsquo;s slightly odd, because YouTube offers AI closed-captioning, shown above, which can be auto-translated by adjusting the video&rsquo;s settings. YouTube does not offer dubbed audio.) </p>



<p>Microsoft plans to translate the video from Spanish to English and from English to German, Hindi, Italian,

<p>Have you ever asked, <em>why can&rsquo;t I just tell the PC what I want it to do?</em> If you&rsquo;re in that camp, there&rsquo;s good news: A new AI update to the Windows Power Automate app may make that future a reality.</p>



<p>Microsoft is finally adding Copilot-like capabilities to Power Automate, the &ldquo;power macro&rdquo; Windows app that you likely have never used. And one of the best additions will be the ability to literally talk the AI through the process. It&rsquo;s not here yet &mdash; it&rsquo;s part of an early access program &mdash; but this could be an extremely powerful update when it finally arrives.</p>

<p>For years, reviews of Microsoft&rsquo;s Surface Pro came with a big caveat. They were light, they were lovely &mdash; and the Windows tablet also shipped with a thin kickstand that sliced into your thighs.</p>



<p>Microsoft&rsquo;s latest Surface Pro 2024 (aka the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2336210/microsoft-launches-surface-pro-10-surface-laptop-6-with-ai-power.html">Surface Pro 11th edition</a>) solves that problem with the Flex Keyboard, a detachable, wireless keyboard that seems immensely obvious in retrospect.</p>



<p>Microsoft&rsquo;s Surface Pro is <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2337930/meet-the-future-of-windows-copilot-pcs-feature-practical-ai-tools.html">a Copilot+ PC</a>, and our eventual review will probably lean hard into how fast the Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite chip is.

<p>Microsoft&rsquo;s Paint app now boasts not just one, but two AI art tools &mdash; Image Creator and Cocreator &mdash; and boy, are they something.</p>



<p>First things first: <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2148866/paint-ai-functions-layers-and-image-editing-like-in-adobe-photoshop-and-gimp.html">Microsoft Cocreator</a>, the scaled-down version of Microsoft&rsquo;s Bing Image Creator/Microsoft Designer, is still the engine of AI art in Paint.

<p>Many of Microsoft&rsquo;s Surface devices aim at something: a tablet. A mini laptop. A pull-forward design. The Surface Laptop 2024 (7th Edition) is less about the Microsoft hardware than what&rsquo;s inside it &mdash; namely, a new <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2284554/qualcomm-says-snapdragon-x-elite-kicks-intel-core-ultras-butt-too.html">Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite chip</a>.</p>



<p>Like the Surface Laptop 5, the Surface Laptop 2024 comes in two sizes, a slightly larger 13.8-inch (versus a 13.5-inch display for its predecessor) and the 15-inch model. On paper, the 15-inch model is a third of a pound lighter, but I didn&rsquo;t notice a difference while lifting it. Both displays put out 400 nits, which is close enough to the 384 nits we measured the Surface Laptop 5 at.</p>
