Even without the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-overturns-helldivers-2-psn-requirement-following-backlash">whole PSN debacle</a>, Helldivers 2 has had hectic few months, with developer Arrowhead pumping out wild, game-changing updates at a furious pace. But it looks like the studio is finally ready to ease off a bit, and has said it feels a "slightly lower [update] cadence... will benefit both us, you, and the game."
</p><p>
Arrowhead CEO Johan Pilestedt first <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-balancing-has-sometimes-gone-too-far-ceo-admits">hinted at some adjustments</a> to the studio's current development strategy at the start of May, when he said he would be talking to the team about in-game balancing, agreeing that changes had perhaps "gone too far" in recent months. And another strategy shift has now be

Hunt: Showdown, the acclaimed PvEvP bounty hunting horror shooter from developer Crytek, is waving goodbye to Xbox One and PlayStation 4 on 15th August - but owners will be able to upgrade to the current-gen versions for free.
</p><p>
Crytek's David Fifield confirmed an August end date for PS4 and Xbox One support in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0lAW63LTYo">new video</a> laying the groundwork for Hunt: Showdown's next major update, which is being described as a "significant relaunch of [the game] at a whole new level".
</p><p>
"After this is live and running natively on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series consoles," Fifield explained in the video, "you will no longer be able to play at all on the older generations of consoles and will need to upgrade."

Nintendo's Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door remake has added lines confirming villain-turned-companion character Vivian is transgender after references relating to her gender identity were removed in the original 2004 English translation.
</p><p>
In The Thousand-Year Door's original Japanese release, Vivian - one of three villainous Shadow Sisters - is deliberately misgendered by various characters, including her sister Marilyn.
</p><p>
When the GameCube title was translated for its worldwide release, some territories retained references to Vivian's trans identity - Italy, for instance, had the character respond defiantly to Marilyn instead of apologising after one instance of misgendering, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210921074641/http://www.fti.uab.es/tradumatica/revista/num5/articles/06/06central.htm">saying</

## The System Shock remake arrives on consoles with its retro modern magic intact

This re-envisioning of the original 1994 System Shock stands as one of the most engaging immersive sims I've ever played and took a spot on my personal GOTY collection. This is a game that does <em>not</em> hold your hand; it asks a lot of players but gives a lot in turn. The remake is now available on PS4, PS5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S, and we've tested it on all platforms to see how well it runs on each, how it handles on a gamepad, and what, if anything, doesn't make the cut from that spectacular PC release. </p><p>As I covered in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-the-system-shock-remake-is-excellent-and-nightdives-most-ambitious-work-yet">my System Shock remake review</a>,

This is an impressive number, but did you know there have also been six official Planet of the Apes games? Well, I'm going to guess not because the majority of them have either been bad, boring or broken and ultimately, utterly forgettable.</p><p>Join me in today's video (above) as I take you on a retrospective journey through the hairy history of six official Planet of the Apes games that you&rsquo;ve probably never even heard of.</p><p>If you'd prefer (especially if the headline video isn't showing up for you), you can watch my video on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZT6Bvhv3nA" target="_blank"> Hairy History of 6 Forgotten Planet of the Apes games</a> over on Y

After completing this morning's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/wordle">Wordle</a> I found myself drawn to a "New!" link advertising WordleBot, a smart-sounding addition to The New York Times app which promised to analyse my puzzle solution and compare it with others. (I got today's word in six, for which I'm still feeling a little shameful.)
</p><p>
Scrolling through its results I was impressed - not only does WordleBot show how other players began today's game and then narrowed down the solution over subsequent guesses, it also shows how WordleBot itself, programmed with a set of rules and likelihoods, fared too. (WordleBot only got today's word after five guesses, which immediately made me feel a little better.)
</p><p>
This was my first experience of WordleBot, a program I now understand has existed for some time onlin

Microsoft has shown off how its Copilot AI feature will soon be able to give players a helping hand in games such as Minecraft by offering up real-time advice. 
</p><p>

The company shared two videos to its social media account on X last night, demonstrating this feature. In the first video, a person playing Minecraft needs some assistance crafting a sword. 
</p><p>

"To craft a sword, you'll need some materials," Copilot says, prompting the player to open their inventory. The Copilot notices the player does not have all the necessary resources available, so offers a suggestion of what to do next.

A new report states that 46 percent of players use gaming for self-expression, to ignite their imagination, and for creation.
</p><p>
That's according to this year's fifth annual Inside Gaming Report, published by entertainment and gaming wiki Fandom.
</p><p>
As well as indicating the prevalence of character creators in games, the results come as little surprise considering the popularity of live-service and sandbox games like Minecraft, Fortnite, and Roblox in which creativity is paramount.

Pok&eacute;mon Go is set to introduce a form of item sharing when playing within Parties, according to a fresh datamine of the game's files. 
</p><p>
This looks set to allow players to share the effects of active items such as Lucky Eggs, Star Pieces and Incenses with other players - though the feature is still in testing so may yet change, <a href="https://pokemongohub.net/post/news/datamine-report-share-items-in-party-up-to-3-zyguarde-cells-per-route-and-more/">Pok&eacute;monGoHub</a> warned. 
</p><p>
The suggestion, though, is that one player will be able to pop a Lucky Egg for double XP and press a button to then share that boost with everyone else in the Party - saving resources and Pok&eacute;Coins spent on buying premium items separately.

The original was rightly praised for its exploration of grief, trauma and mental illness, but how do you tell more of a story about a woman's struggles with psychosis without seeming repetitive or worse, exploitative? The answer, it turns out, is you make Hellblade 2 - a game that is nothing short of phenomenal.</p><p>As you may remember, Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice concerns itself with Pictish warrior Senua, a woman living with psychosis as she struggles to come to terms with her mental illness, the stigma that separates her from her community, and the death of her lover Dillian at the hands of raiding Northmen. After an opening cinematic briefly outlining the above, Hellblade 2 p
