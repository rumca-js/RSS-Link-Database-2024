## Letting a LXC within a hypervisor handle DHCP. Okay or unwise?

Generally, to make the trip easier we try to collaborate on meals/snacks with everyone and split the cost of whatever is being shared amongst all the families coming. For example, one family would plan a meal to feed everyone Monday and Wednesday, then another family would feed everyone Tuesday and Thursday, we get treats or snacks to share and then we all buy what is needed for the trip. We then turn in receipts and split the cost at the end of the trip. Generally, this has resulted pretty successful but what we get caught up on a lot is sometimes families will buy and bring 2 or 3 of the same condiments or everyone brings a bag of licorice to share but then that results in the shared stuff

I got 4x4TB drives with it and I set up Raid 5. This was fairly straight forward. I host Plex and Transmission on it now but managing folder permissions and docker is a real pain and I think it's buggy as hell. I can't find access to a terminal on root level which would make many things easier (the irony of things).</p> <p>I feel way more comfortable to save my data on a self-hosted solution compared to Google or other clouds but - and this might be extremely controversial to some - the hardware as well as the software comes out of China, so I have security concerns. How can you be sure that the NAS doesn't have some backdoor or data miner on it? I'd rather go with Open Source when it comes to this, like TrueNAS, but as the NAS is fairly new, it's really difficult to find tutorials or guides and there is risk of voidin

The RPi5 auto logins to a user session and opens the browser in full screen kiosk mode, which automatically starts a Jitsi call as the start page. To share your screen you enter the jitsi call and start screen sharing.

I could use some help since my Search-Fu seems to be lacking.</p> <p>I am currently overhauling and upgrading my home server, which has served me well since 2010. Since I want to get another decade out of this new setup, I am also looking to add new features and functions.

I picked up an old optiplex 3010 with the main purpose to be a proxmox server that will run all of my services. I am a big security guy, so the first thing that I have setup is pfSense. However, something that I cant for the life of me figure out is how can I configure pfSense and proxmox so that I can access the proxmox gui in the network pfsense creates? The pfsense network is being created correctly, but I cannot access the proxmox gui when connected to it. The goal of this was to run pfSense and manage my whole home network from it, which includes all of the things that my proxmox will be running.</p> <p>Thank you all!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/stargaze_1547"> /u/stargaze_1547 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1cwzu88/connecting_to_proxmox_gui_through_pf
