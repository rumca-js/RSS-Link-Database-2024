<p>OpenAI is bringing a new AI model, GPT-4o, to ChatGPT, the company said Monday. The idea is to bring &ldquo;GPT-4&rdquo;-class chat to the OpenAI app, and for free to all OpenAI users.</p>



<p>OpenAI will accompany the launch of the GPT-4o model with a new Mac app that will showcase the capabilities of the new model, which can now &ldquo;see&rdquo; the world around it. A Windows app will debut later on. The GPT-4o model can now &ldquo;see,&rdquo; as well, via vision capabilities that include desktop screenshots as well as the ability to upload video and screenshots from a mobile app &mdash; again, just an iPhone app for now.</p>



<p>Perhaps the most intriguing thing about the new ChatGPT app with GPT-4o, however, is that the model now seems far more human in both tone and intonation. For one thing, the model is &ldquo;real time,&rdquo; which means that you do

<p>Microsoft is launching a new application called Places, which will offer employees and organizations balancing home and in-office work a better way to figure out who is where, and when.</p>



<p>You&rsquo;ll probably immediately know if you or your team might be using Places, given that you&rsquo;re already familiar with your company&rsquo;s attitude towards remote work. It&rsquo;s clear that some companies would like to convince their workers to return to the office, while some workers would rather avoid the stress and expense of a commute and work from home.</p>



<p>Places is designed to balance that tension, Microsoft said. First off, the app can be used as a standalone indicator of who will be in the office, and when. But it will also be integrated into both Outlook and Copilot, so you can visually see which team members will be where, or just ask Copilot

<p>AI isn&rsquo;t just a <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2302123/what-is-an-ai-pc-we-cut-through-the-hype.html">buzzword trying to drive PC sales</a> to consumers. It&rsquo;s also becoming a huge and very lucrative business &mdash; just ask Nvidia, which has more than doubled its stock price in the last year off of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1935564/nvidia-passes-1-trillion-market-cap-as-investors-fall-in-love-with-ai.html">selling GPUs to data centers</a> powering the backend of generative artificial intelligence apps. And chip competitor Arm, and its business daddy SoftBank, wants a piece of that pie. </p>

<p>If you revise a document several times and save it again and again as a separate file, it is often difficult to see exactly which changes you have made and where. </p>



<p>The same happens if a doc has been edited by several people. However, you can use Word to display the changed passages. </p>
