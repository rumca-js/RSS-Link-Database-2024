What an exquisite extra cruelty.</p><p>John Jennings’ mother, Carol, now virtually paralysed and non-speaking, became symptomatic at 50. He is 38.

Its form captures an ancient human history and artistry, using the age-old <em>terra sigillata</em> technique, where the forms aren’t glazed but are coated with a slip made from diluted clay. The vessel’s form also represents a necessity, to carry and to transport, that endures. A single, protruding nub in the side of the piece – evoking a nose, or a nipple

But in the furniture shop, when an unctuous salesman (Eduardo Antuña) suggests the “famous” Rörret coffee table – glass top, held aloft by two golden nymphs, a snip at €1,099 – old tensions emerge. Jesús is smitten; María thinks it’s a tacky abomination. She gets to choose everything, he says – even forcing him to have kids, and also dictating their son’s name, Cayetano. “A shoddy name for a fascist bullfighter,” he says. The salesman, who shares the moniker, is put out.</p><p>The worst happens; they buy the table.

<p>Many people’s sex lives can dip in middle age – and tiredness is a real passion killer. But there are simple things that can make a difference</p><p>It’s easy to buy into the narrative that sex after 50 is more trouble than it is worth. Fluctuating or falling levels of sex hormones can play havoc with a woman’s desire and experience of sex during perimenopause and beyond. Not only are there physical changes that can render what was once pleasurable unsatisfying or even painful, but tiredness, anxiety and diminished self-confidence can also put the kibosh on sex.</p><p>Doctors don’t necessarily help. “I suspect part of the reason why a lot of people are gloomy is because they’ve had pushback from doctors who have reacted to their desire to continue having sex with a bit of amazement. Like, you’re not procreating any more, so why should it matter to you?” says <a href="https://suzannenoble.co.uk/">Suzanne Noble</a>, a 63-year-old entrepreneur who is determined to rewrite the rulebook

They didn’t do FC Köln any favours on Saturday night.

It takes a lot to dampen the spirits of the people of Cologne at any time, but on this Saturday? Nothing was going to smother the fire in their hearts.

They couldn’t quite believe this. “We were already relegated,” defender Timo Hübers told Sky afterwards. “We were mentally and physically exhausted.”</p> <a href="https:

<p>The wobbly, creamy fridge favourite paired with freezer fruit – easy!</p><p>In her book of English puddings, and in <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/English_Puddings/DMWIDwAAQBAJ?gbpv=1">the delightful chapter about jellies, blancmanges and flummeries</a>, Mary Norwak notes that the art of thickening began in medieval times. Fruit pectin had long been used as a way of preserving and thickening, but it was the practice of extracting collagen from fish or meat bones that, in the 1300s, allowed for new ways of setting jellies – first savoury, then sweet – in (privileged) kitchens. Then, in the 16th century, isinglass, made from the dried swim bladders of sturgeon, made its way from Russia to England via Dutch traders. Primarily used for the calcification of beer, isinglass provided another means of setting, until the process was revolutionised again in the early 1700s by the invention of the pressure cooker. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_digester">Denis P

<p>The Labour peer and former Liberty director makes a clear, impassioned case for human rights law, but steers surprisingly clear of thorny political arguments</p><p>It may sound a little melodramatic to say that human rights are under attack in Britain. But in the week I opened this book, it certainly didn’t feel that way. Parliament was locked in battle over the Rwanda bill, widely seen as driving a coach and horses through human rights obligations, with Shami Chakrabarti herself in the thick of the fray as a Labour peer. Nigel Farage was once again demanding Britain leave the European convention on human rights – the new passion project for Brexiters who would rather not talk about how Brexit itself is going, and who see the convention as a haven of suspiciously lefty values – while Rishi Sunak was bending over backwards not to rule that out. There’s still something faintly surreal about having to actively make a case for the right to life, liberty, or freedom from being tortured

She reflects on activism, illness, and never letting abuse define her</p><p>When Kathleen Hanna was 19 years old, a man broke into her apartment while she was out and attacked her roommate, Allee. The man beat her, dragged her by her hair and said he would rape and kill her but, as Allee fought back, he lost his grip, allowing her to run into the street and call for help. Hanna decided enough was enough. “You know when these big life events happen, like when someone close to you dies or gets cancer or is assaulted?” she says. “A lot of times they change us. I just thought: ‘This can’t happen again. How can I be part of the solution?’”</p><p>The answer lay just a few blocks from their apartment at SafePlace, a rape relief and domestic violence centre. Hanna, who was already a rape survivor, walked over and signed up for volunteer work. “It wasn’t me trying to be a good person,

The writing was note-perfect; able to puncture moments of colossal tension with a warm turn of phrase. The performances, too, were about as good as you can get across the board. Even the idea of the series – patiently waiting for seven years before returning, so that Rhys Connah could naturally age into the role Sally Wainwright wanted to tell – was extraordinary. Happy Valley felt so far ahead of the pack that unanimous victory seemed certain. They could have just mailed a crate of trophies to Sarah Lancashire’s

But true to the fictional history of the Planet of the Apes series, it may be the apes who ultimately inherit this title from the petty, small-minded humans. The original Planet of the Apes came out in 1968 – and based on first weekend box office and positive reviews for Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes, the latest installment of a rebooted series that began in 2011, the series will probably remain when the first movie reaches its 60th anniversary in just four years.

His coming-of-age tale is like a Scottish version of The End of Eddy by the French novelist <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/edouard-louis">Édouard Louis</a>; two first-person accounts of growing up gay and working-class in the declining industrial hinterlands of the late 20th century.

It started with an investigation into racist policing, and featured episodes such as <a href="https://edm.parliament.uk/early-day-motion/9326">Racebusters</a>, which documented everyday racial harassment in Britain.

<p>The British novelist’s first memoir is a sublime account of famed Welsh music studio Rockfield, where her indomitable mother ruled the kitchen in the 70s and rock’n’rollers were great fun – and infuriating</p><p>Sometimes the most compelling family memoirs are not those that recount particularly extraordinary lives but which, rather, are told in the most beguiling voice. Tiffany Murray recounts hers from the perspective of an eight-year-old and so fills these pages with the giddy, carbonated fizz of prepubescence. She erupts frequently into different-sized fonts whenever she needs to convey maximum glee and trips into onomatopoeia (“ujjjjj aaah caaaah”) when normal words simply won’t suffice. In this way, she is able to smuggle into the narrative, almost unseen, a correspondingly piercing pathos that, in the hands of others, might just have tipped this towards misery memoir. Instead, the abiding tone is one of wonder and joy.</p><p>An author with three novels to her name, Murray is

<p>A tender film about the music of Mayan descendants is hampered by the alofty adherence to a documentary aesthetic where nothing is explained</p><p>This film about a flute player and farmer named José Pérez López from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinacant%C3%A1n">Zinacantán</a> in Chiapas, Mexico, teems with beautifully shot images of folks playing music, embroidering, participating in days-long community rituals, and tending their crops of flowers in polytunnels – pretty normal everyday stuff.

<p>Acts of solidarity will be demonised and slogans will be twisted, but they have never been more important</p><p>In 1988, the Syrian poet Nizar Qabbani, the most celebrated Arab poet of the modern era, wrote The Trilogy of the Children of the Stones. The poem was dedicated to the children of the first Palestinian intifada, who, in hurling stones at Israeli soldiers, became symbols of the era. The intifada was triggered in 1987 by frustration over the Israeli occupation in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, and was characterised by civil disobedience, non-violent protest and, most iconically, those children.</p><p>“O Children of Gaza, don’t mind our broadcasts”, Qabbani wrote, counting himself as part of an older generation whose attempts at compromise with Israel had failed to deliver freedom for the Palestinians.<strong> </strong>“Don’t listen to us / We are the people of cold calculation … The age of political reason has long departed / So teach us madness.”</p><p>Nesrine Malik is
