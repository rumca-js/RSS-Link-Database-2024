## Dyson’s first dedicated hard floor cleaner doesn’t suck

<p>It’s a new direction for Dyson: a floor cleaner without mention of suction, cyclone technology or any of its usual vacuum vocabulary. The Wash G1 is the company’s debut hard-floor cleaner, and it swaps suction for high-speed rollers, water and nylon bristles. It’ll go on sale later this year for $700/ £600, which is expensive but still cheaper than Dyson’s top-of-the-line Gen 5 vacuum. I got to test out the Wash G1 at Dyson’s HQ, a few hours west of London in the UK.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The product was born from the increased presence of hard floors in our lives. Dyson says there are fewer and fewer carpeted rooms in homes around the world. However, hard-floor cleaning (industrial processes aside) has remained a pretty manual process, usually involving mops (or Swiffer cloths, you monster) that leave smears and streaks. Typical mopping also leads to wiping diluted dirt and stains around your floors after the first dunk.</p>

<p>The expensive and gorgeous iPad Pro M4 is a complicated device that’s hard to outright recommend — does it make sense to spend well over $1,000 for a tablet with the inherent limitations of iPadOS compared to a Mac or Windows PC? <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2RwL0IwRDNKN0dQUlgvcmVmPWZzX2FfaXB0Ml91czI_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLXYtaWwtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjczNjAwYzUzLWE2MjYtNGFhMC05NTE3LTBkMGIyNjE4M2RhMyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAQIU0Xt4iK0-jSaOoXTbBZwwTF6J61IJOqeYzpIzU5Dw&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0D3J7GPRX%2Fref%3Dfs_a_ipt2_us2">The iPad Air</a>, however, is much easier to evaluate.

## Meta’s next hardware project might be AI-infused headphones with cameras

<p>It’s no secret that Meta is eager to prove itself as an AI company, and it might be eyeing a new hardware project to help it get there. The company is in the early stages of “exploring” designs for AI-enabled headphones, according to a <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/meta-explores-ai-assisted-earphones-with-cameras?rc=whf0fd"><ins>new report</ins></a> in <em>The Information</em>.</p>
<p>The company is reportedly calling it “Camerabuds,” because the headphones or earbuds (the company is considering both designs) would have two outward-facing cameras that would be able to detect the wearer’s surroundings and power real-time AI features. In that way, it sounds a but like what the company has done with the multimodal AI features in its <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/the-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-new-ai-powers-are-impressive-and-worrying-181036772.html"><ins>smart glasses</ins></a>.</p>

It’s also capable of recognizing emotion, lets you interrupt it mid-speech, and responds nearly as fast as a human being during conversations.</p>
<p>“The special thing about GPT-4o is it beings GPT-4 level intelligence to everyone, including our free users,” said OpenAI CTO Mira Murati during a live-streamed presentation. “This is the first time we’re making a huge step forward when it comes to ease of use.”</p>

On Friday, the province's labor tribunal granted union accreditation to workers at the DXT4 warehouse in Laval, a Montreal suburb.

<p>A group of some 200 workers are organizing as the Laval Amazon Workers Union under the Confédération des syndicats nationaux (CSN), which represents around 330,000 people across a variety of industries in Canada.

<p>The recipe for Google’s A-series Pixels is incredibly straightforward: Combine top-notch cameras with a vivid display and then cram all that in a tried and tested design for a reasonable price. But with the addition of a Tensor G3 chip, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-8a-hands-on-flagship-ai-and-a-120hz-oled-screen-for-499-160046236.html">the Pixel 8a</a> now supports the same powerful AI features as Google’s flagship phones.
