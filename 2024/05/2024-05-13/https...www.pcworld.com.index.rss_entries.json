The idea is to bring &ldquo;GPT-4&rdquo;-class chat to the OpenAI app, and for free to all OpenAI users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>OpenAI will accompany the launch of the GPT-4o model with a new Mac app that will showcase the capabilities of the new model, which can now &ldquo;see&rdquo; the world around it. A Windows app will debut later on. The GPT-4o model can now &ldquo;see,&rdquo; as well, via vision capabilities that include desktop screenshots as well as the ability to upload video and screenshots from a mobile app &mdash; again, just an iPhone app for now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps the most intriguing thing about the new ChatGPT app with GPT-4o, however, is that the model now seems far more human in both tone and intonation.
