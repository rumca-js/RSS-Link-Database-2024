The company, which changed its name to Vale Group earlier this year, does not plan to replace Hilf as CEO after his departure at the end of May. Instead, the current leadership team will oversee day-to-day operations, reporting to Jody Allen, the sister of Paul Allen, a Vale Group spokesperson said in response to GeekWire&#8217;s inquiry. Jody Allen co-founded the company and was its prior CEO.

The new study, called the\u00a0Seattle Spatial Transcriptomic Research in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Evaluation (STRIDE)\u00a0study, will be a first-of-its-kind pediatric study. Researchers will use state-of-the-art technology to understand how genes and other molecules behave in individual cells of patients who haven&#8217;t been treated yet.

The pre-seed funding round announced Monday was led by Seattle-area venture capital firm&#160;Fuse, with participation from Pack Ventures. Previous investors included Madrona Venture Group\u2019s Pioneer Fund. Aerial plans to use the fresh cash to accelerate its artificial intelligence solutions.

The trend has created a paradox for the Seattle-area companies that have set bold climate goals to slash their carbon emissions ahead of international targets \u2014\u00a0but now have rising energy needs thanks to a surge in generative AI interest that is stoking their businesses. Projections for future energy needs for data centers are startling.
