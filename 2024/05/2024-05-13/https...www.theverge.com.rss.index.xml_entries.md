  <p id="GvKAws">OpenAI is making a number of its previously subscription-only features available to free users of ChatGPT, with the biggest being the ability to create custom chatbots and browse its GPT Store.</p>
<p id="JCaS46">The company opened its GPT Store to paid subscribers just four months ago on January 10th. The store lets users create their own chatbots, called GPTs, and share them. Some of the trending bots right now include an <a href="https://chatgpt.com/g/g-pmuQfob8d-image-generator">image-generating bot</a>, a chatbot <a href="https://chatgpt.com/g/g-bo0FiWLY7-consensus">called Consensus</a> that’s geared toward helping with scientific research, and a <a href="https://chatgpt.com/g/g-gFt1

<p id="O1p58N">In the demo shown by OpenAI, users could open the ChatGPT desktop app in a small window, alongside another program. They asked ChatGPT questions about what’s on their screen — whether by typing or saying it. ChatGPT could then respond based on what it “sees.”</p>
