The new study, called the Seattle Spatial Transcriptomic Research in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Evaluation (STRIDE) study, will be a first-of-its-kind pediatric study. Researchers will use state-of-the-art technology to understand how genes and other molecules behave in individual cells of patients who haven&#8217;t been treated yet. IBD — which includes Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis — affects 3 million people in the United States and 30% of all&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/allen-institute-and-seattle-childrens-to-study-inflammatory-bo

The trend has created a paradox for the Seattle-area companies that have set bold climate goals to slash their carbon emissions ahead of international targets — but now have rising energy needs thanks to a surge in generative AI interest that is stoking their businesses. Projections for future energy needs for data centers are startling.
