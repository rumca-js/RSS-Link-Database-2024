								<p>Games Workshop has revealed a single picture of a strange, hovering blob monster, partway between a tick and a face hugger, and promises a full reveal on Saturday May 18. We&rsquo;re already excited, because this looks remarkably like a forgotten but very impactful xenos species, the Enslavers,&nbsp;with massive implications for&nbsp;Warhammer 40k lore.

								<p>Without DnD character sheets, there is no Dungeons and Dragons game. Sure, you could try and track your character&rsquo;s stats and backstory on a napkin, but you&rsquo;re better off taking notes in the tidy boxes of a tailored Dungeons and Dragons character sheet.

								<p>If you’ve been playing the TCG for a while, you probably remember when <strong>Fairy Pokémon cards</strong> were a thing. These rare and elusive Pokémon used to have their own Basic Energy, as well as a vibrant pink color scheme for their cards. But those days are long gone – in 2020, <strong>Pokémon Fairy cards</strong> were officially discontinued. No more pretty in pink.</p>
<p>Since the Sword and Shield <a href="https://www.wargamer.com/pokemon-trading-card-game/pokemon-tcg-expansions">Pokémon TCG expansions</a> phased out Fairy cards, these Pokémon don’t see much play anymore. However, there’s still plenty of reason for Fairy fans to keep up their <a href="https://www.wargamer.com/pokemon-trading-card-game/pokemon-card-
