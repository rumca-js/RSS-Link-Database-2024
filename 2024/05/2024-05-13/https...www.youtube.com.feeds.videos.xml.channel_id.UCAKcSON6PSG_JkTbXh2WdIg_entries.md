It’s been a whirlwind year for Sierra Ferrell. Last September, Ferrell won the Emerging Artist award at the Americana Honors & Awards, and just last week, she was nominated in three categories for the 2024 Americana Honors & Awards. Ferrell released her latest album, Trail of Flowers, on March 22, and made her Grand Ole Opry debut before embarking on tour in support of the album.

Despite all the attention, Ferrell stays grounded on her mission to be “a beacon of light” for people through her music. During a tour stop in the Twin Cities to play a show at First Avenue in Minneapolis, Ferrell and her band visited The Current for a studio session hosted by Jessica Paxton. Watch and listen to the full interview above.
