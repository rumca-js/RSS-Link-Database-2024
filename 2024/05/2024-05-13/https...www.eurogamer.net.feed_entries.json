There's no consensus on how it works or what memories even are. I once read about how a memory could simply be a recollection of the last time you thought about that memory. It struck me as being a very sorrowful idea, and one that combines neatly with a personal belief: true death is when the last person who remembers you dies. Sure, someone can read your name on a gravestone, but it's that living memory which is truly you, and it's oddly terrifying to think it could be a fabrication. Even as I write this, though, I'm sure you can find a scientific paper which disagrees with the theory. It's like we all have a puzzle box trapped inside our heads but, since our minds are unique, every solution is different.</p><p>One thing is true though: unlike a computer, we can't s", "language": "en-gb", "link": "https://www.eurogamer.net/no-case-should-remain-unsolved-finds-truth-in-distorted-memories", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.eurogamer.net/feed", "source_obj__id": 107, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/No-Case-Should-Remain-Unsolved-Header.jpg?width=1920&height=1920&fit=bounds&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp", "title": "No Case Should Remain Unsolved finds truth in distorted memories", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
