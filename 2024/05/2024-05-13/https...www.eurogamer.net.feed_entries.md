It's been a funny few weeks for Helldivers 2; one day it was riding high on its well-deserved success, the next it was being reviewed bombed into oblivion after Sony decided to foist <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-steam-players-will-soon-need-to-link-a-psn-account-and-they-arent-happy">mandatory PSN accounts</a> on PC players. But now that drama is starting to subside following a dramatic U-turn, all thoughts have turned to one thing: was the review bomb cape developer Arrowhead's CEO Johan Pilestedt previously hinted at real? It would certain seem so.

Talk of a review-bomb-inspired Helldivers 2 cape, if you're a little behind on events, first surfaced as fans celebrated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-overturns-helldivers-2-psn-requirement-following-backlash">Sony's U-turn</a> on Tuesday - an un

## Prison Architect 2 developer Double Eleven parts ways with Paradox Interactive after nine years on series

Paradox Interactive has announced it's parting ways with Prison Architect 2 developer Double Eleven after nine years on the popular management series, saying it "could not find a commercial agreement that worked for both parties".
</p><p>
Double Eleven first became involved with Prison Architect after it was hired to port the game to consoles, and the studio took full control of the series when original developer Introversion Software <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-interactive-picks-up-the-rights-to-prison-architect">sold the rights to Paradox</a> in 2019.  Since then, it's released ten expansion packs, culminating in last year's Jungle Pack, and has led development of a fully 3D sequel, Prison Architect 2.

## Red Dead Redemption 1 finally heading to PC, new datamine suggests

After nearly 14 years of waiting, PC players might soon have a version of Rockstar's open-world cowboy epic Red Dead Redemption to call their own - if a new datamine proves accurate.
</p><p>
Red Dead Redemption - which follows former outlaw John Marston as he travels across the American West and Mexico - has remained doggedly console-only since its PS3 and Xbox 360 launch in 2010. But the game's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-coming-to-ps4-and-nintendo-switch-later-this-month">recent arrival on Switch and PlayStation</a> had reignited hopes a long-overdue PC release might finally be on the cards - and a fresh discovery by a dataminer with some form when it comes to Rockster leaks suggests that is, indeed, the case.

Ubisoft's upcoming feudal Japan-set Assassin's Creed game now has a final name: Assassin's Creed Shadows. 
</p><p>
Previously, it was known only under its working title, Assassin's Creed: Codename Red.
</p><p>
Shadows will get a full reveal later this week, on Wednesday 15th May at 5pm UK time. It's then we'll get a full trailer for the game, which will debut on YouTube (or you'll be able to find it right here on Eurogamer).

## After 27 years, Super Mario 64's last remaining locked door has finally been opened

An unopenable door in Super Mario 64 - thought impossible to pass through without the use of mods - has finally been prised open.
</p><p>
The door in question can be found within the game's infamous penguin level - you know, the one where you definitely didn't yeet the baby penguin off the mountain. 
</p><p>
There, a log cabin can be found with a door that opens outwards - but that's impossible to return through due to an invisible wall. Because of this, it's the only door in the game that was thought impossible to be opened both ways - until, last month, someone finally pulled it off.

</p><p>
Yes, it's a tiny snippet, but fans are already speculating on this new enemy ahead of the DLC's release next month.

A number of "experimental" changes have been made to Manor Lords to tweak the balance, including reduced ale consumption.
</p><p>
Ahead of the weekend, the game's solo developer Greg Stycze&amp;nacute released a Steam blog post detailing a tonne of changes, which are available now for open testing.
</p><p>
The update fixes a number of commonly reported issues, including "None" people spawning and not working; the game being stuck at the summary screen after a victory; weak archer damage; and overly high ale consumption.

Pok&eacute;mon Go developer Niantic has released a new mixed-reality experience, as the next step in its virtual pet franchise Peridot.

Fans of EA Sports FC have responded angrily after EA altered a perceived issue with FUT rewards providing "unintended results".
</p><p>
As part of the game's Weekend League, players have a chance to win special versions of certain players, which this past weekend included Kylian Mbappe who's considered the best player in the game.
</p><p>
EA doesn't release the odds of receiving specific players, but Mbappe and other top players appeared to be cropping up more often than usual at the start of the weekend.

A trademark for what looks to be a new Doom game has resurfaced after originally being filed by Bethesda back in January, as the suggestion of a reveal in a few weeks' time now swirls.
</p><p>
The pending <a href="https://t.co/CT4fHsEOfc">trademark</a>, filed in the US, is titled "IDKFA" - a well-known cheat code used in the Doom series.

There's no consensus on how it works or what memories even are. I once read about how a memory could simply be a recollection of the last time you thought about that memory. It struck me as being a very sorrowful idea, and one that combines neatly with a personal belief: true death is when the last person who remembers you dies. Sure, someone can read your name on a gravestone, but it's that living memory which is truly you, and it's oddly terrifying to think it could be a fabrication. Even as I write this, though, I'm sure you can find a scientific paper which disagrees with the theory. It's like we all have a puzzle box trapped inside our heads but, since our minds are unique, every solution is different.</p><p>One thing is true though: unlike a computer, we can't s
