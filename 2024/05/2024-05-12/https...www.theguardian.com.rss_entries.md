<p>The chief inspector’s latest warning makes it clear that problems go right to the top of the prison service</p><p>Many, though not all, of England’s prisons are in a terrible state. The alleged escape last year of Daniel Khalife from HMP Wandsworth, and the manhunt that led to his recapture, focused attention on staffing and other problems at the south London prison (Mr&nbsp;Khalife has pleaded not guilty and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/jan/18/man-arrested-in-connection-with-daniel-khalife-alleged-prison-escape">goes on trial</a> in October). Last week’s letter to the justice secretary, Alex Chalk, from the prisons inspectorate, put paid to any hope that this dramatic episode could have led to improvement. The warning it contained, known as an urgent notification, criticised “poor leadership at every level” including at the Ministry of Justice.

<p>“Breaking down barriers since 1978” was the message on the big screens in the seconds before kick-off, a nod to Laurie Cunningham, Brendon Batson and Cyrille Regis, a trio of West Bromwich Albion heroes credited with changing the face of the game. At the end of this playoff semi-final West Brom were left wondering what might have been after failing to find a way past the Southampton goalkeeper Alex McCarthy, who ensured Friday’s second leg is finely poised.</p><p>Both teams will look back on the 78th minute as a moment when things could have turned in their favour. McCarthy made a big save to deny Grady Diangana after Tom Fellows charged down the right wing, breezed past two Southampton players and laid the ball on a plate for his teammate. Southampton promptly went up the other end and the substitute Ross Stewart’s deflected shot looked set to beat Alex Palmer only for the West Brom goalkeeper, diving to his left, to hook the ball clear with his right foot.</p> <a href="https://ww

I was actually quite surprised to see them turn up at some of the big shows this season: Prada, Miu Miu, Louis Vuitton. It might be that our obsession with indie sleaze is finally taking hold in a bigger way and then, of course, you have zeitgeisty cultural moments that have put them back in the conversation, like the Amy Winehouse biopic.

<p>A young female playwright publicly lampoons her novelist father in this astute tale of family differences</p><p>Among an author’s most dreaded readers, their parents rank perhaps most highly. Megan Nolan once stated that her main fear is not “scornful strangers” but “subjecting” her parents to her fiction; while RO Kwon insists she would keep her books away “from all kin” if she could. In Jo Hamya’s well-aimed second novel, <em>The Hypocrite</em>, a young woman’s writing broaches decades-old conversations that push her family relationships to ruin’s edge. At its centre, a chauvinistic, middle-aged male novelist is publicly lampooned by his own daughter.</p><p>The work in question – a play by 27-year-old Sophia – revisits a trip with her father to a family friend’s holiday home in Sicily’s Aeolian Islands. The father attends a matinee performance (fatefully ignorant of its subject) and the novel slips back and forth between his account of this experience and a tense lunch in which S

Conceived for performance at the Hollywood Bowl, it was inspired by a visit to another Los Angeles landmark, the Griffith Observatory. There Shaw contemplated the vast infinity of the cosmos, relating it to the vista of the city below and the smallness of everyday lives, and the unfathomable nature of these extremes led her to the world of sci-fi.</p><p>It’s a complex mix in which the echoes of those initial chords resonate periodically, notably in the brass, as an aural guide; constellations of woodwind glint and flicker, patterns and orbits appear and fade.

It should be dramatically rich territory for this British indie (which was shot in Merseyside and Wales): Sarah (Rebel Wilson, in a rare and not entirely comfortable non-comedy performance) struggles to see traces of the man she fell in love with in amnesiac Joe (Celyn Jones). And former architect Toni (Charlotte Gainsbourg, slouching despondently through her performance like a teenager plunged into ennui by a spotty wifi signal) is now a full-time carer for Gwen (Trine Dyrholm), who has no memory of the past 15 years. Unfortunately, it’s clumsily contrived and disingenuous stuff. A film so grating that you long for the sweet release of amnesia.</p><p>In UK and Irish cinema

Crowned Queen of Scotland after her father’s death when she was six days old, she was smuggled over to France aged five to prevent Henry VIII from marrying her off to his son Edward, in order to bring the Scots to heel. She briefly became Queen of France, and had three husbands, all of whom died on her (one, possibly, with her connivance), before being beheaded for treason by Elizabeth at the age of 44.</p><p>The paradox of a queen who was also a political pawn is captured with breathtaking ferocity by 71-year-old Isabelle Huppert, who recounts the story of Mary’s life on the eve of her death, with excerpts from her letters.

Full of spring, a bit Garden of England (cherries, broad beans and cucumber) and quite a bit of Italian.</p><p>My dream is that I’ll prepare all of this in advance and leave platters around the place along with bowls of roasted nuts and chipsticks. It will, of course, be sunny and I’ll receive our guests into our tidy house, perfectly relaxed, having done all the work in advance. Revellers will spill outside enjoying beer from the local brewery and boxes of cheap wine. The kids will behave impeccably throughout and I’ll be ready to embark on the second half of my life. This may be fanciful, but I hope someone (hint, hint) will also bake me a cake so I’ll have candles to blow out.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/article/2024/may/12/tempting-springtime-party-food-to-prepare-in-advance"

He talks about his work – and his most famous fan</p><p>One night in 2005, during one of his epic group road trips across America, the photographer Ryan McGinley trained his camera on a naked man and woman on a van roof in California. “We were looking at shooting stars and I was trying to do some long exposures to get something cool,” says McGinley, “but I didn’t have the technical capabilities so I just did a point-and-shoot.”</p><p>The attempt to capture the stars may have failed, but the photograph itself, suggesting the tenderness and vulnerability of lovers against the vast emptiness of space, did not. After the trip, McGinley put together a zine of recent images to share with friends and people he knew, including Elton John, who had developed an interest in the photographer’s work. “Elton said: ‘Thank you’,

<p>The Irish novelist on navigating success shortly after a cancer diagnosis and a marriage breakdown, the renaissance in Irish writing, and how his ‘tragic worldview’ fits the times</p><p>Paul Lynch is the author of five novels. Born in 1977, he grew up in Malin Head, the most northerly point on the Irish coast. His latest novel, <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/sep/03/prophet-song-by-paul-lynch-review-a-tale-of-dublins-descent-into-dystopia-is-crucial-reading">Prophet Song</a></em>, depicts a nightmarish vision of Ireland sliding into an authoritarian regime. Written in long, poetic sentences – without speech marks and few paragraph breaks – the novel pulls the reader into the claustrophobic world of a city under siege. Described by Lit Hub as a “300-page panic-attack”, <em>Prophet Song</em>, just published in paperback, won the Booker prize last year. Lynch has been compared to Cormac McCarthy and William Faulkner.</p><p><strong>How has it been since you </strong

She is, he explains, just too worldly and cultured for him, filling their conversation with references that he cannot follow: “Who is Kafkaesque?” he asks. “I’ve never … I don’t know him.”</p><p>This year marks the centenary of Franz Kafka’s death, and the appearance of his name in a mainstream sitcom is a reminder that he is part of that tiny group of writers – along with Shakespeare and Dickens, certainly – whose overall style and manner is so identifiable that it has become an adjective. Just as a sooty-cheeked urchin

<p>The novelist sat for her father three times – first in a naked portrait when she was 18. Now 65, she has written a memoir based on the diaries she kept at the time. She talks about her chaotic childhood, writing truthfully about her dad, and the books she read to him on his deathbed</p><p>Rose Boyt’s memoir, <em>Naked Portrait</em>, is, in the narrowest sense, her account of sitting for three paintings for her father, Lucian Freud. In the first, she sprawls, unclothed, legs spread wide on her father’s chaise, aged 18. In the second, at 31, she is buttoned up in a dark shirt, hair cropped, refusing the artist’s gaze. And in the third, at 39, she perches on a sofa arm, beside her husband, Mark Pearce, his son Alex, and their new baby Stella, in a homemade floral patterned dress.</p><p>You might say that the loose triptych represents a sort of allegory of independence for Boyt, from the wildly overbearing legacy of her father, and in some ways her book has that sort of triumphant, sur
