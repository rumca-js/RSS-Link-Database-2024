At no point in your travels throughout Hyrule will you hear a single track that was meant to replicate the sound of creaking wood moving along a dirt path. That's because Tears of the Kingdom's audio system is designed to operate just like its complex physics system. Sounds that happen naturally in the world--wheels turning and hooves stomping, for example--come together just like the wheels and cart themselves. They create a harmonious sound that is made up as you play.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">It's a charming example that highlights what makes pretty much everything within Tears of the Kingdom fantastic.

These are the women who prove that motherhood is not a one-size fits all title--that it doesn't look like simply being nurturing, over-protecting, and docile.
