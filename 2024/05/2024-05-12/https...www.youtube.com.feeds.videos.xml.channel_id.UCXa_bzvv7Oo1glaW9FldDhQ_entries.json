Launching in 2021, the survival horror title was met with widespread acclaim from critics and audiences alike, and has since gone on to sell impressive numbers, and looking back, it\u2019s hard not to say that all of that success has been well deserved. \n\nBest described as a theme park of horrors, not only did Resident Evil Village boast an impressive variety in both styles of horror and types of gameplay experiences, but it also captured the genre\u2019s many different flavors quite effectively- and it did all of that without feeling like it was lacking cohesion. Here, with Resident Evil Village now three years old, we\u2019re going to talk about all of that and more.", "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BS3NBSImO2A", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "source_obj__id": 129, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/BS3NBSImO2A/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "THREE YEARS LATER, What Made Resident Evil 8: Village One Hell of a Game?", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-05-12T13:30:01+00:00", "description": "The one style of game design that never seems to go out of style is one that puts players in a hub-and-spoke world.
