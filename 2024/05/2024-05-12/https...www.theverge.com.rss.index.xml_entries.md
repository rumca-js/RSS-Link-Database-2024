  <p id="5s0RYa">iPhone users without a penchant for jailbreaking can finally enjoy the blocky polygons and shifty textures of the original PlayStation with <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gamma-game-emulator/id6499106870">Gamma</a>, a free PS1 emulator that hit the iOS App Store last night.

  <p class="p--has-dropcap" id="gwhxwz">I can’t think of anything permeating mainstream camera culture as aggressively as the DJI Osmo Pocket 3. The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/21/24079251/people-have-very-strong-opinions-about-fujfilms-latest-camera">Fujifilm X100VI has stolen some of its thunder</a> among film simulation enthusiasts, but DJI’s still having somewhat of a cultural moment on YouTube, Instagram, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23651507/tiktok-ban-us-news">the troubled TikTok</a> by spurring all sorts of creator glee.</p>

  <p id="O8kWMg">Not all video games need video. Over the years, games that exist only in audio have taken players into entirely new worlds in which there’s nothing to see and still everything to do. These games have huge accessibility implications, allowing people who can’t see to play an equally fun, equally immersive game with their other senses. And when all you have is sound, there’s actually even more you can do to make your game great.</p>
