Hello guys and gals, it's me Mutahar again! In the last few years EA games has outright devolved from a company that once made some of my favourite experimental games such as "Mirror's Edge" into a company that aims to further devolve the quality of their games all for live service titles. Battlefield was a game I grew up with and to see it treated in a manner where EA forgets what made this franchise unique in the first place isn't just sad to see, it's enraging. Thanks for watching!
