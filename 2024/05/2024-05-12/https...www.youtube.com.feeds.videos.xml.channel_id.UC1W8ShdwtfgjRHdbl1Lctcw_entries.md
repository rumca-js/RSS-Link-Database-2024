I colorized, restored and created a sound design for this video of Toronto, Canada in the 1920s. Views of city streets, traffic, walkers and cars in the streets. A panoramic view of Toronto. Views of Mary Pickford's birthplace, the Legislative Assembly and the National Gallery of Canada.

Video Restoration Process:
✔ FPS boosted to 60 frames per second 
✔ Image resolution boosted up to HD 
✔ Improved video sharpness and brightness 
✔ Colorized only for the ambiance (not historically accurate)
✔added sound only for the ambiance
✔restoration:(stabilisation,denoise,cleand,deblur) 

Please, be aware that colorization colors are not real and fake, colorization was made only for the ambiance and do not represent real historical data.
