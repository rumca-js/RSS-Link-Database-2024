It’s still very early days for Mojo, the new systems programming language from Chris Lattner that imitates large portions of Python and can execute Python code directly via a compatibility layer.</p>

<p>Ferdinand Schenck reports here on building a PNG decoding routine in Mojo, with a detailed dive into both the PNG spec and the current state of the Mojo language.

<p><a href="https://www.ardc.net/about/">About ARDC (Amateur Radio Digital Communications)</a></p>
In ham radio adjacent news, here's a foundation that it's worth knowing about:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ARDC makes grants to projects and organizations that are experimenting with new ways to advance both amateur radio and digital communication science.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1981 they were issued the entire 44.x.x.x block of IP addresses - 16 million in total. In 2019 they sold a quarter of those IPs to Amazon for about $100 million, providing them with a very healthy endowment from which they can run their grants program!

<p><a href="https://www.anildash.com//2019/12/10/link-in-bio-is-how-they-tried-to-kill-the-web/">“Link In Bio” is a slow knife</a></p>
Anil Dash writing in 2019 about how Instagram’s “link in bio” thing (where users cannot post links to things in Instagram posts or comments, just a single link field in their bio) is harmful for linking on the web.</p>

<p>Today it’s even worse. TikTok has the same culture, and LinkedIn and Twitter both algorithmically de-boost anything with a URL in it, encouraging users to  share screenshots (often unsourced) rather than linking to content and reducing their distribution.</p>

<p>It’s gross.
