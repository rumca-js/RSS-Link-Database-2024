I thoroughly enjoyed my experience with this game to the point that even months on from its original release date, I still think about and play it regularly. It's the kind of game where within the first few minutes, you instantly know you'll be playing and replaying for years to come. Developed by Evening Star - the team behind Sonic Mania - what we're looking at here is a game that fully understands Sonic's momentum-based platforming on a level that is rarely observed, translated into 3D in a way that not even Sonic Team has truly managed.\n</p><p>\nIn a sense, Penny's Big Breakaway is a game that feels as if it were built in 1995 during the rise of 3D graphics by time travellers from the modern era, bringing with them today's modern knowl", "language": "en-gb", "link": "https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-pennys-big-breakaway-is-a-perfect-blend-of-old-school-platforming-and-brilliant-innovation", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.eurogamer.net/feed", "source_obj__id": 107, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/1_Q3aGmgV.png?width=1920&height=1920&fit=bounds&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp", "title": "Penny's Big Breakaway is a perfect blend of old-school platforming and brilliant innovation", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-05-12T13:00:00+00:00", "description": "<img src=\"https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/b1_sO9L7VR.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp\" /> <p>After burning incredibly brightly for a short while, it feels like Content Warning's star might be dimming rather quickly now.

So many role-playing games I have encountered focus on gathering friends and romantic interests around the protagonist, but how much focus do they give to your character's family members? There are lots of games about found families, but could I think of one that was about siblings and parents and grandparents?</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-2-is-one-of-gamings-best-explorations-of-family-lif", "language": "en-gb", "link": "https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-2-is-one-of-gamings-best-explorations-of-family-life", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.eurogamer.net/feed", "source_obj__id": 107, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Dragon-Age-2-Hawke.jpg?width=1920&height=1920&fit=bounds&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp", "title": "Dragon Age 2 is one of gaming's best explorations of family life", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
