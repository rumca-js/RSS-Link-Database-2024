<p>The former AFL player was known to mates and Dockers supporters as ‘Dardy McCrafty’, and embraced being ‘a bit of a weirdo’</p><p>Cam McCarthy was born on April 1, 1995, the same day the Fremantle Dockers played their first ever game in the Australian Football League. As a kid, he’d worm his way down to the fence at Subiaco for Dockers games. His dad constructed special chairs so Cam and his mates could see properly.</p><p>He was an excellent cricketer, and never saw himself playing professional football. Always a small kid, he shot up nearly a foot in his draft year. He was working as an apprentice plumber but was suddenly on every club’s radar. It was a crack draft, with Marcus Bontempelli, Josh Kelly and Zach Merrett. Playing for Western Australia against the Victoria Country team in the national championships, McCarthy kicked the winning goal on the siren.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/article/2024/may/13/cam-mccarthy-afl-fremantle-dockers-gws-giants-remem

In theory, the guardrail is straightforward: people’s democratic rights to protest&nbsp;must be protected, but any spillover into antisemitism is to be loudly condemned.
