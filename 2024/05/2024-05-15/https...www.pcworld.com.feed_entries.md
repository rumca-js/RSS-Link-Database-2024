<p>If you own an older productivity laptop, Microsoft&rsquo;s Xbox Cloud Gaming can be the way you avoid buying a pricey gaming PC. Now, Microsoft says that you&rsquo;ll be able to enjoy a more PC-like experience with mouse and keyboard support for select titles within Cloud Gaming on a web browser, beginning today.</p>



<p>Microsoft also said that the mouse-and-keyboard experience will also be accessible via the Microsoft Xbox app for Windows later this month.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/402201/report-microsoft-razer-push-to-bring-mouse-and-keyboard-support-to-xbox.html">Mouse and keyboard support has existed for years</a> on the Xbox, though only on titles that supported them. On the PC, you&rsquo;ll need to have either the Google Chrome or the Microsoft Edge browser installed, plus, of course, a mouse and keyboard. Even then, there will o

<p>Switching to a solid-state drive is the best upgrade you can make for your PC. These wondrous devices speed up boot times, improve the responsiveness of your programs and games, and generally make your computer feel fast. But not all solid-state drives are the same. You can spend big to achieve read and write speeds that reach a whole other level, or you can find top-notch SSDs that offer solid performance <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/785331/why-you-dont-need-to-splurge-on-an-ultra-fast-ssd.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">without breaking the bank</a>.</p>



<p>Many SSDs come in a 2.5-inch form factor and connect to your PC via the same SATA port used by a traditional hard drive. But tiny NVMe (Non-Volatile Memory Express) &ldquo;gumstick&rdquo; SSDs that fit in an M.2 connection on a modern motherboard are becoming increasingly commo

<p>What&rsquo;s the first thing you think of when you read the words &ldquo;web search&rdquo;? According to market share data, nine out of ten of you would say &ldquo;Google,&rdquo; or at least that&rsquo;s the web search of choice worldwide by a startling 90 percent. Google just rolled out a &ldquo;Web&rdquo; search option along with its usual Images, News, Shopping, Maps, etc. tabs. It might just be a big deal. </p>



<p>But wait, isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;web search&rdquo; what you&rsquo;re <em>supposed </em>to get with a standard Google query, without any need to click on a secondary tab? Yes and no. <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://twitter.com/searchliaison/status/1790473952256786805/photo/1&amp;xcust=2-1-2334403-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Google&rsquo;s official SearchLiason Twitter account</a>

<p>With Thunderbolt Share, Intel is turning the Thunderbolt cable into a way to connect two PCs to one another, sharing files or controlling a PC. Simple, huh? Well, except that Intel isn&rsquo;t exactly making it available to everybody.</p>



<p>Thunderbolt Share is a new Intel specification that connects two PCs via a cable, one to each Thunderbolt port. Alternatively, you can connect it to a Thunderbolt dock instead. Thunderbolt Share offers several options, all at blazing 40Gbps or higher speeds: control another PC, transfer files, sync them, or even migrate one PC to another. Is it a killer sneakernet replacement? Sure seems like it for local networks.</p>



<p>The idea? You or your family own more than one PC. If they&rsquo;re Thunderbolt-capable, Share will unlock a number of handy additional sharing capabilities without needing to set up a workgroup, a net

<p>Microsoft has been trying to get Windows users to adopt machines based on the Arm architecture (the same type of chips that power smartphones and other small devices) for years, with limited success. But the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2117798/qualcomms-next-snapdragon-looks-like-the-fastest-pc-processor.html">upcoming push in conjunction with Qualcomm</a> might just do it, if a new Dell documentation leak is accurate. The new chips reportedly deliver jaw-dropping battery life. </p>



<p>A leaked internal slideshow and spec list shows Dell&rsquo;s own testing for laptops based on Qualcomm&rsquo;s upcoming Snapdragon X architecture. These laptops are coming later this year from a variety of vendors. Crucially, this info includes Dell&rsquo;s battery life estimates meant to be shared among its own employees &mdash; not the usual battery life estimates

<p>The difference between the real world and the AI world is a flight of a dozen stairs.</p>



<p>In my basement office, I listened to what Google presented at Google I/O. I heard executives talk about search, Android, and Project Astra: a future multimodal &ldquo;universal agent&rdquo; that can understand audio and video, built around versions of Gemini both large and small. One million tokens is a big deal, right?</p>



<p>I guess. But to whom? </p>



<p>What I heard at Google I/O was a future that&hellip;is still in the future, for a price that most people can&rsquo;t afford, and with features that were developed <em>by</em> Google employees <em>for</em> Google employees. It&rsquo;s a Google that, more and more, seems to have lost the plot. </p>

<p>Ah, the taskbar. It&rsquo;s a vital part of the Windows operating system. It&rsquo;s the place to go when you want to change the date and time, check the weather, and so much more. If you&rsquo;re looking to change the color of said taskbar, you&rsquo;ve come to the right place. Although Windows automatically selects a color for the taskbar (usually black or white), there&rsquo;s a way to set a fixed hue and we&rsquo;re going to tell you how to do it. </p>
