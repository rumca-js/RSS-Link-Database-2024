Tired of being underserved and overbilled by shitty regional broadband monopolies, back in 2002 a coalition of local Utah governments formed UTOPIA &#8212; (the Utah Telecommunication Open Infrastructure Agency). The inter-local agency collaborative venture then set about building an &#8220;open access&#8221; fiber network that allows any ISP to then come and compete on the shared [&#8230;]

Is there any law that Elon Musk actually understands? The latest is that he’s lost yet another lawsuit, this time (in part) for not understanding copyright law. There have been a variety of lawsuits regarding data scraping over the past decade, and we’ve long argued that such scraping should be allowed under the law (though [&#8230;]

Oh, man. There&#8217;s so much going on here. The headline is only part of it. We&#8217;ll get to it (and through it) as efficiently as possible but expect multiple stops along the way. Georgia Gee&#8217;s reporting on this for Wired is devastating. There&#8217;s so much stupidity and wrongness going on here, the article almost reads [&#8230;]

MATLAB allows matrix manipulations, plotting of functions and data, implementation of algorithms, creating of user interfaces, and interfacing with programs written in other languages. That&#8217;s all well and good, but it means nothing if you don&#8217;t have a firm grasp of the data types used within MATLAB. In this course you&#8217;ll cover not just data [&#8230;]

Who has a stronger case that the TikTok ban is unconstitutional? TikTok itself… or its users? We may find out, as both are trying. Last week, TikTok officially filed a petition to challenge the Constitutionality of the TikTok ban law. I’ve heard a few people say that they don’t believe TikTok has that strong of [&#8230;]

Streaming video still provides some meaningful advantages to traditional cable: it&#8217;s generally cheaper (assuming you don&#8217;t sign up for every service under the sun); customer satisfaction ratings are generally higher; and users have more power to pick and choose and cancel services at a whim. But the party simply isn&#8217;t going to last. Thanks to [&#8230;]

For all the pissing and moaning I did during the acquisition of Activision Blizzard by Microsoft &#8212; principally over the latter&#8217;s routine desire to talk about non-exclusivity in its games only to make them exclusive &#8212; Sony sure does know how to shit the bed when it comes to cross-platform titles and how to treat [&#8230;]
