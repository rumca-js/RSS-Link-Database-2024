<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone, I would appreciate your help with identifying what a good solution would be for this. I'll get right to it.</p> <p>I work for a non-profit that has a need for an internal digital library -- we do a lot of reading: books, articles, .pdfs, etc.</p> <p>Currently the organization is using a cloud storage software that is typically used for hardware backups to upload all of their digital content. It's clunky, overpriced because we aren't using it for the intended use case, unlimited storage (which we don't need), and has nearly non-existent UI, and horrible user management. </p> <p>The requirements would be something akin to the following:</p> <ul> <li>A user-friendly digital library management software for digital text content, EPUB and pdf files primarily</li> <li>We have google workspace for non-profits, so ideally something that would work with using google drive as a backend (it gives us 100TB of free storage, more than we will ever need)

If I use the proxy with nginx to access it via a subdomain, I actually get a page, and the browser tab says Portmaster, but it's a blank black page.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone,</p> <p>I recently purchased an HP Elitedesk 800 G4 Tower with the goal of setting up Proxmox to run a firewall VM and other services like AdGuard. To facilitate this, I ordered an Intel I226 2.5Gbps 4-port network card to connect my router to the firewall and various peripherals.</p> <p>Today, the network card arrived, and I attempted to install it in both the PCIe x16 and x4 slots. Unfortunately, the PC refuses to boot and there's no display on the screen when the card is installed. When I remove the network card, the PC boots up perfectly fine.</p> <p>I tried disabling numerous settings in the BIOS, but nothing seems to help. I also updated the BIOS directly over the network through the BIOS interface.</p> <p>I should mention that I also have a GPU in the PCIe x16 slot and a Wi-Fi card in the PCIe x1 slot, and neither of these prevents the PC from booting. It is specifically the Intel I226 network card that is causing the issue.</p> <p>

Ability to connect webder (a separate proxy that can render sites running on js). 2. Plugins - now you can conveniently configure proxies and create your own engines and middlewares. 3. You can now use jsx in the code of engines. 4. Improved text format of proxy output, now it is convenient to read in text, even less weight. 5. Added middlewares, now it is possible to add code highlighting (already added highlighting with hljs) and custom elements. 6. Now if an engine gives an error, the proxy looks for another suitable engine. Engines can improve only one part of the site (by routes), and where site parsing is not implemented readability will work.</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/TxtDot/txtdot/releases/tag/v1.8.0">https://github.com/TxtDot/txtdot/releas

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>The permissions are confusing, I had an issue where transmission was saying there was no space available even though there is plenty on my Synology NAS. I read something that said the space error I was seeing could be due to lack permissions and so I ran chmod 777 or I believe chmod -r 777 on the VM for transmission and the one for ARR stack respectively. Now sonarr and radarr are unable to import anything and transmission is still broke and the only thing that works is my sabnzbd container to download stuff but anything that downloads cannot be imported. </p> <p>I obviously nuked the file permissions from the containers to the synology file system, but have no idea how to fix it. Hoping somebody has some clear idea of what I need to do and is willing to smack some knowledge on me or at least throw me a tip or two to point me in the right direction. </p> <p>Thanks in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddi
