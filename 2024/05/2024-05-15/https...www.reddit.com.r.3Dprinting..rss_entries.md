<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi,</p> <p>I have used Fusion360 for about 4 years and it's all I know. I have been pushed over the limit with the issues and the fact that it's an app that needs internet to function. Today I tried to work on a file and the program won't let me log in. It's time for me to find an alternative, but I need to minimise the time it will take me to learn a whole new system. This will be a big pain point for me. Is there anything that's very similar that does not need an internet connection that is free or under $200USD? I looked at FreeCAD but it looks completely alien to me and I dread having to feel lost and frustrated for the next 2 months until I figure it out.</p> <p>For clarification I should mention that it must not be web-based, I want a program that I can install on Windows and never need to go online to use and that the company cannot force an update or block my access to the software after I have purchased it. Such software products are becoming
