<p>Ryan Reynolds leads an all-star cast in a sweet, if a little messy, tale of imaginary friends reconnecting with the grown-ups who once bid them goodbye</p><p>If, the new kids comedy from John Krasinski, has all the elements of a family friendly hit: a healthy dose of sentimentality, a heavy emphasis on the power of a child’s imagination and a prerequisite of tragedy undergirding on a girl’s journey. Also, an expensive mix of live-action and animation and an all-star cast of voice actors – among them, George Clooney, Jon Stewart, Amy Schumer, Bradley Cooper, Maya Rudolph and Krasinski’s wife, Emily Blunt – playing a roster of Imaginary Friends (Ifs) forgotten by their grown-up creators and companions.</p><p>On paper, Krasinski’s first kids film as a writer-director checks the boxes, though in practice it’s not quite as cuddly as Blue, the giant purple bear hug of an If hammily voiced by Steve Carell, looks.

She straddles a white horse and holds the US flag in the album’s cover art. In other photos, the flag is everything, everywhere, all at once – capes, boots, bomber jackets with leather frills, durags, sashes, scarves and hair beads. Unlike white artists who drape themselves in red, white and blue, Mrs Carter becomes a billionaire cultural astronaut, and drives the flag pole down into the ground as a stake for Black America.

It was a film that used the so-recently-devastated real streets and people of Rome on location for a project on which Rossellini started script work well before the end of the war, building on ideas by screenwriter Sergio Amidei with dialogue contribution by the young Federico Fellini.</p><p>Rome, Open City is revived as part of the<a href="https://whatson.bfi.org.uk/Online/default.asp?BOparam::WScontent::loa

Minogue replied: “You girls are hot. You know it. I love it. I’m here for it. Is that an answer?” Not really, to be honest.

With each dispatch, Levy’s stand-ins contend with this battering frustration: there are, Levy is sure, rules for life; but no one follows <em>hers</em>, and she can’t figure out <em>theirs</em>.

<p>The Irish novelist is at the height of his powers with a sequel to Brooklyn, set twenty years later</p><p>Asked recently why he had chosen to write a sequel to his much-loved 2009 novel, Brooklyn, Colm Tóibín said, “The answer is why not? The other&nbsp;answer is that there are very good&nbsp;reasons not. I mean, leave it alone&nbsp;– why interfere with people’s imaginations about what happens to the characters? Also, and this is not true for Hilary Mantel or The Godfather, but in general sequels tend to be pale.”</p><p>Not this one. While Tóibín’s palette may be rather lighter on vermilion than Puzo’s – or indeed Mantel’s – Long Island is anything but pale. As for the characters, it is pure pleasure to be back in their absorbingly complex company.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/article/2024/may/15/long-island-by-colm-toibin-review-happy-ever-after">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Sarah Thornton had dismissed them as ‘dumb boobs’ until a double mastectomy changed everything. Her new book, Tits Up, explores what our beliefs about breasts mean – from feeding babies to bra design and Baywatch </p><p>Throughout her life, Sarah Thornton hadn’t given much thought to her breasts. They were there, of course, and they’d fed two children. But they had also attracted unwanted attention, and latterly they’d become a source of concern – with a history of breast cancer in her family, and after years of vigilance and tests, in 2018 Thornton was about to undergo a preventive double mastectomy. Preparing for the operation, she realised she still hadn’t given them much consideration, nor what it would be like to have “new” breasts in the form of implants. When they turned out to be bigger than expected, she was shocked, “but in the end,” she says, “it wasn’t the aesthetic form as much as the feeling. It was like losing sentience. And it put me on a quest to understand these t

<p>When a dating site for people seeking extra-marital affairs was hacked, lives were ruined.

For the first episode of three, Ashley Madison: Sex, Lies &amp; Scandal seems more like a sales pitch for the adultery site than a serious investigative documentary, though it does eventually get to the grit of the saga. Ashley Madison, you may recall, was – and, astonishingly, remains – a dating site for married people who want to have an affair, discreetly. In 2015, a mysterious hacking group threatened to leak, then did leak, details of the site’s users, exposing many men to their unsuspecting families, colleagues and, in some cases, constituents. The hackers followed this with a second data dump, revealing serious privacy failings within the company itself, as well
