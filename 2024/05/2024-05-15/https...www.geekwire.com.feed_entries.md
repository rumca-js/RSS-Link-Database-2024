The tool acts as a AI travel agent of sorts, letting users find flights by providing general desires for a trip. For example: The tool leverages generative AI technology from OpenAI,&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/ai-travel-planner-tool-from-alaska-airlines-shows-potential-future-of-airfare-search/">Read More</a>

But there&#8217;s reason for optimism starting in the second half of this year, according to Gordon Pan, the president of Baird Capital, the Chicago-based venture capital and global private equity firm. Pan spoke during a VIP reception sponsored by Baird in advance of the GeekWire Awards on Thursday evening.

But four years in, the carbon footprint for the cloud, software and gaming giant keeps expanding. Depending on how you tally Microsoft&#8217;s greenhouse gas emissions, they&#8217;re now between 29% and 40% higher than when CEO Satya Nadella made his pledge. That&#8217;s according to the company&#8217;s 2024 Environmental Sustainability Report, which documents its impacts for the 2023 fiscal year and was released Wednesday.

That&#8217;s one of the points made by Amazon in its response Monday to the Federal Trade Commission&#8217;s allegations about executives&#8217; use of the Signal encrypted communications app, known for its &#8220;disappearing messages&#8221; feature. &#8220;For these individuals, just like other short-form messaging, Signal was not a means to send &#8216;structured, narrative text&#8217;; it was a way to get someone’s attention or have quick exchanges on sensitive topics like public relations or human resources,&#8221; the&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/nothing-to-see-here-amazon-tells-court-
