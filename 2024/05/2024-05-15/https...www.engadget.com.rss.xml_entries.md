<p>Google has unveiled Wear OS 5 at its I/O developer conference today, giving us a glimpse of new features and other improvements coming with the platform. The company isn't quite ready to roll out the final version of the wearable OS, but its developer preview already features enhanced battery life. As an example, Google said Wear OS 5 will consume 20 percent less power than Wear OS 4 if the user runs a marathon. Wear OS 4 already <a href="https://www.engadget.com/pixel-watch-2-review-not-leading-the-way-but-no-longer-lagging-170007702.html">brought battery life improvements</a> to smartwatches that support it, but it could still be a lot better at managing a device's power. Google also provided developers with a new guide on how to conserve power and battery, so that they can create more efficient apps.</p>

As such, any app will eventually be able to tap into the more than 600 million devices that are connected to Home, even if they're not necessarily smart home-oriented apps. Google suggests, for instance, that a food delivery app might be able to switch on the outdoor lights before the courier shows up with dinner.</p>
<p>The APIs build on the foundation of Matter and Google says it created them with privacy and security at the forefront. For one thing, developers who tap into the APIs will need to pass certification before rolling out their app. In addition, apps won't be able to access someone's smart home devices without a user's explicit consent.</p>

<p>Xbox is expanding its accessibility footprint with the Proteus Controller, a modular gamepad created by nascent peripheral company Byowave as part of the Designed for Xbox program. The Proteus Controller is a group of palm-sized cubes that can be connected to each other in a wide variety of configurations, with interchangeable faceplates that include standard controller buttons, analog sticks and a directional pad. This means players can set up the Proteus Controller to be used in individualized ways: in one hand, flat on a desktop, as part of a traditional gamepad with palm grips, connected to a joystick, and other setups.</p>
<p>The Proteus Controller is <a href="https://www.byowave.com/product/proteus-controller-kit-vip">available for pre-order</a> now at a discounted price of $255. It's expected to ship in the fall. The full kit includes two power cubes, two analogue cubes (with Hall effect sensors), one half cube and two spacers, plus the swappable peripherals. There's a D-pad

<p>This week, streaming services are joining linear networks in revealing some of the projects they've got coming up in an attempt to win over advertisers. After Prime Video <a href="https://www.engadget.com/a-tomb-raider-series-from-phoebe-waller-bridge-is-on-the-way-to-prime-video-153636273.html">stepped up to the plate on Tuesday</a>, it was Warner Bros. Discovery's turn at bat on Wednesday. The company surprised many by dropping a teaser trailer for <em>Dune: Prophecy</em>, a six-episode Dune prequel series that's coming to Max this fall.</p>
<p>The spinoff is set 10,000 years before the events of the Dune movies. It follows two Harkonnen sisters who tackle a threat to humanity while setting up the sisterhood that will eventually become the Bene Gesserit. <em>Dune: Prophecy </em>is based on the novel <em>Sisterhood of Dune </em>by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/this-is-the-future-of-generative-ai-according-to-generative-ai-160010937.html">AI's capabilities are growing</a> at tremendous speeds, and while that apparently warrants a ton of the United States' money for development, it doesn't seem to translate to a very obvious action: regulation. A bipartisan group of four senators, led by majority leader <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-us-senate-and-silicon-valley-reconvene-for-a-second-ai-insight-forum-143128622.html">Chuck Schumer</a>, have announced a legislative plan for AI that includes putting $32 billion towards research and development. But, it passes off the responsibility of devising regulatory measures around areas such as job eliminations, discrimination and copyright infringement to Senate committees.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“It’s very hard to do regulations because AI is changing too quickly,” Schumer said in an interview published by The New York Times. Yet, in March, the European Parliament appro

<p>After <a href="https://www.engadget.com/canon-eos-r3-leak-professional-caliber-body-101523180.html"><ins>years of rumors</ins></a>, Canon has confirmed that a <a href="https://en.canon-cna.com/cameras/eos-r1/#prId=303538"><ins>flagship EOS R1 camera</ins></a> is in the works for its EOS line. The full-frame <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-mirrorless-cameras-133026494.html"><ins>mirrorless camera</ins></a> is slated to arrive later this year and, while Canon hasn't revealed all the details just yet, it teased just enough to whet your appetite. There's no indication as to how much the EOS R1 will cost just yet either, but you may need to dig deep into your wallet this one.</p>
<p>The company says that the professional-grade camera will have an RF mount and offer improved video and still performance compared with the EOS R3. It will boast an upgraded image processing system that combines a fresh CMOS sensor, a new image processor called Digic Accelerator and the existing Digic

<p>This might come as a shock to you but the things people put on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-european-union-is-investigating-metas-election-policies-175134538.html">social media aren't always truthful</a> — really blew your mind there, right? Due to this, it can be challenging for people to know what's real without context or expertise in a specific area. That's part of why many platforms use a fact-checking team to keep an eye (often more so look like they're keeping an eye) on what's getting shared. Now, Threads is getting its own fact-checking program, Adam Mosseri, head of Instagram and de-facto person in charge at Threads, <a href="https://www.threads.net/@mosseri/post/C6-BJRjPNte/?xmt=AQGzqkh-E8QwN3vrN48XrtWrxbpcd0Va7kWMpgEODny6pw">announced</a>. He first shared the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/threads-is-going-to-fact-check-content-on-its-app-010720646.html">company's plans to do so</a> in December.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At last year's Google I/O developer conference, the company <a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-project-gameface/">introduced Project Gameface</a>, a hands-free gaming &quot;mouse&quot; that allows users to control a computer's cursor with movements of their head and facial gestures. This year, Google has announced that it has open-sourced more code for Project Gameface, allowing developers <a href="https://developers.googleblog.com/en/project-gameface-launches-on-android/">to build Android applications</a> that can use the technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The tool relies on the phone's front camera to track facial expressions and head movements, which can be used to control a virtual cursor. A user could smile to &quot;select&quot; items onscreen, for instance, or raise their left eyebrow to go back to the home screen on an Android phone. In addition, users can set thresholds or gesture sizes for each expression, so that they can control how prominent their expressions shoul

<p>Google boss, Sundar Pichai, wrapped up the company‚Äôs I/O developer conference by noting its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/everything-announced-at-google-io-2024-including-gemini-ai-project-astra-android-15-and-more-210414580.html">almost-two-hour presentation</a> had mentioned AI 121 times. It was <em>everywhere</em>.</p>
<p>Google‚Äôs newest AI model, Gemini 1.5 Flash, is built for speed and efficiency. The company said it created Flash because developers wanted a lighter, less expensive model than Gemini Pro to build AI-powered apps and services.</p>
<p>Google says it‚Äôll double Gemini‚Äôs context window to two million tokens, enough to process two hours of video, 22 hours of audio, more than 60,000 lines of code or 1.4 million-plus words at the same time.</p>
<p>But the bigger news is how the company is sewing AI into all the things you‚Äôre already using. With search, it‚Äôll be able to answer your complex questions (a la Copilot in Bing), but for now, you‚Äôll have to s
