I was emailing with an Industrial Design engineer from Apple who told me: 
"One thing I've learned that can really make a product great is to find the magic and bring it forward."

I really love that concept and i think it´s essential for the Marble Machine that i allow the whimsical, artistic, non-engineering parts of the project blossom. Giant flywheel? YES!
Combine this with a more strict more deliberate design process should bring us closer to our goal this time.
