Ubisoft has cancelled its upcoming free-to-play shooter The Division Heartland, as it moves to refocus its resources on "bigger opportunities".
</p><p>
The Division Heartland <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-announces-the-division-free-to-play-spin-off-heartland">was announced for PC and consoles</a> back in May 2021, when it was original set to launch within a vague "2021-22" release window. Since then, it's resurfaced intermittently, and an open beta last summer - followed by a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-division-heartland-has-been-rated-in-taiwan-hinting-that-a-release-could-be-imminent">Taiwanese ratings board sighting</a> - seemed to suggest a launch was finally drawing near.
</p><p>
However, three years after Heartland's unveiling, Ubisoft has now officially called time on the still-unreleased projec

A fresh report into the inner workings of Microsoft and the influence of its top boss Satya Nadella has shed new light on the pressure for Xbox to release more of its games on rival platforms in a bid to boost profits. 
</p><p>
<a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/microsofts-quest-for-short-term-dollardollardollar-is-doing-long-term-damage-to-windows-surface-xbox-and-beyond">Windows Central</a> states that the plan to launch more Xbox games on PlayStation and Nintendo consoles, an operation dubbed "Latitude", has sparked "debate and unease" within the company at whether the move makes sense. 
</p><p>
Publicly, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-did-we-think-of-microsofts-multiplatform-xbox-soft-launch">Xbox has suggested it is testing the waters with the four games launched so far</a> - multiplatform titles that could be

Ubisoft has revealed a first proper look at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-feudal-japan-title-emerges-from-the-shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, and detailed the game's dual protagonists. Both characters appear front and centre in the game's new cinematic trailer (gameplay will follow next month, Ubisoft says) and on the game's cover, with each offering a markedly different play style. 
</p><p>
Today's trailer opens on Naoe, a female shinobi, as she crosses paths with Yasuke, the historical figure depicted here as a powerful samurai. Initially, it seems, the two are adversaries - but the pair soon find common ground. By the end of the trailer, Naoe is wearing the Assassin's Creed series' iconic Hidden Blade weapon - and both appear to be at least allied with the Assassins.

Following a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-battling-assassins-creed-shadows-leaks-as-main-character-art-appears-online">flurry of pre-announcement leaks</a>, Ubisoft has shared first official details of its feudal Japan-set Assassin's Creed Shadows - including confirmation of its 15th November release date and information on its various "premium" editions, a physical collector's edition, and a season pass giving access to two post-launch expansions and an exclusive quest.
</p><p>
Assassin's Creed Shadows, a full-scale series entry following last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-mirage-review">smaller-scale Assassin's Creed Mirage</a>, was confirmed to be in the works back in September 2022 (albeit under the title Codename Red) and comes from Ubisoft Quebec, the studio behind 2018's

Final Fantasy 14 is getting an official TTRPG, but it's already sold out and set to receive a second print run.
</p><p>
The tabletop game based on the MMORPG was announced last September and is based on the base game A Realm Reborn, allowing players to take on the role of a pre-made Warrior, White Mage, Dragoon or Black Mage, or make their own character from scratch.
</p><p>
Its release is later this month, but already sold out and with a second print coming due to popular demand (thanks <a href="https://www.dicebreaker.com/games/final-fantasy-xiv-ttrpg/news/final-fantasy-14-trpg-reprint-after-selling-out">Dicebreaker</a>).

Microsoft is utilising AI to assist with identifying harmful content and ensure the gaming community is kept safe when playing games online.
</p><p>
In a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/05/14/xbox-transparency-report-may-2024/">blog post for its Xbox Transparency Report</a>, the company reiterated its "advancements in promoting player safety" and "commitment to transparency", as well as its "progressive approach to leveraging AI".
</p><p>
There are two specific ways in which AI is being used: auto labelling and image pattern matching.

You begin with four elements &ndash; water, fire, wind, and earth &ndash; and combine two of them to make a new element. Water and fire make steam, steam and fire make an engine, steam and engine make a train. Before you know it, your bloodshot eyes behold a web of nebulas, political crises, philosophical concepts, and volcanoes (so many volcanoes!) sprawling across a conspiracy map that would make Charlie Kelly blush. But how did one man possibly prepare for all these combinations? Well, behind the curtains of Infinite Craft, an AI synthesises connections between your chosen elements and adds them to a global database. It's a game made by one man, informed by billions of minds, yet powered by no one at all.</p><p>Amid<a href="ht
