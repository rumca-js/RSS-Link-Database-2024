After losing her father Robert in 2017, singer-songwriter Rachael Kilgour was processing the loss and wrote a song about her late father. She then decided to write an entire album of songs as she reflected more deeply on his life. The result is \"My Father Loved Me,\" a collection of nine songs released in September 2023.\n\nRachael Kilgour visited The Current studio for a session hosted by Radio Heartland\u2019s Mike Pengra to play three songs from the album.
