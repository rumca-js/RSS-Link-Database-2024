In today's Daily Fix:
The hits just keep coming for Microsoft this month. One analyst believes that in the last fiscal quarter, Sony's PlayStation 5 shipped 5x more units that the Xbox Series consoles. Previously, it was believed that the PS5 was outselling the Series family at a 2:1 ratio since launch, so if these new numbers are accurate, it represents a recent widening of the gap between the two consoles. In related news, Hi-Fi Rush, the formerly Xbox exclusive game, will be getting its final update this week. With the closure of developer Arkane Austin, it's likely we won't be seeing a sequel in the future. And finally, details for Ubisoft's latest Assassin's Creed game, Shadows have been revealed. Check out the full details and breakdowns of the trailer at IGN.com.
