You begin with four elements &ndash; water, fire, wind, and earth &ndash; and combine two of them to make a new element. Water and fire make steam, steam and fire make an engine, steam and engine make a train. Before you know it, your bloodshot eyes behold a web of nebulas, political crises, philosophical concepts, and volcanoes (so many volcanoes!) sprawling across a conspiracy map that would make Charlie Kelly blush. But how did one man possibly prepare for all these combinations? Well, behind the curtains of Infinite Craft, an AI synthesises connections between your chosen elements and adds them to a global database. It's a game made by one man, informed by billions of minds, yet powered by no one at all.</p><p>Amid<a href=\"ht", "language": "en-gb", "link": "https://www.eurogamer.net/behind-infinite-craft-one-of-the-internets-favourite-time-killers-its-creator-wrangles-with-ai-alchemy", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.eurogamer.net/feed", "source_obj__id": 107, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/infinite-craft-header.JPG?width=1920&height=1920&fit=bounds&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp", "title": "Behind Infinite Craft, one of the internet's favourite time-killers, its creator wrangles with AI \"alchemy\"", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
