		Worldcoin is introducing a process for processing biometrics and other data that it believes is secure enough for other companies to use it to protect themselves and their customers.

The firm, co-founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, has already amassed more than 10 million enrolments in over 160 countries worldwide.

		Zimbabwe is implementing fingerprint and iris biometrics at its borders to automate tasks that have historically been carried out by human agents, such as checking passports, verifying visas, and managing entry/exit records.

This automation of border control will initially be tested at key ports of entry, including Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport, Victoria Falls International Airport, and Beitbridge Border Post, as well as at several inland stations.

According to Gono, the chief director of immigration, in an interview with <a href="https://www.sundaymail.co.zw/zim-rolls-out-unmanned-borders">The Sunday Mail</a>, implementing a <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/service-directory/border-management">border management system</a> will improve the coordinat

		<a href="https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/news/5687307">Reports</a> indicate that the Ministry of the Interior (MOI) in Taiwan is set to face a significant financial burden. The suspension of the digital ID card initiative will cost the MOI 202 million New Taiwan dollars (approximately US$6.27 million) from January 2021 to December 2023. The accumulation of charges is reported to the MOI every six months.
