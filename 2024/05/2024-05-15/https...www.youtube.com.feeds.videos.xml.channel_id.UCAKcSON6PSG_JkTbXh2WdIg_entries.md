Grief is one of those things where there’s really no one way to express it, and those expressions vary greatly from person to person. After losing her father Robert in 2017, singer-songwriter Rachael Kilgour was processing the loss and wrote a song about her late father. She then decided to write an entire album of songs as she reflected more deeply on his life. The result is "My Father Loved Me," a collection of nine songs released in September 2023.

Rachael Kilgour visited The Current studio for a session hosted by Radio Heartland’s Mike Pengra to play three songs from the album. Watch and listen to "Ontario" above.
