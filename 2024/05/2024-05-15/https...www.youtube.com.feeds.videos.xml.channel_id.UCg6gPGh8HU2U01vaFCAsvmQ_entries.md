What happened to Bryan Lunduke, the Linux Sucks Guy?

Bryan Lunduke originally made a series called “Linux Sucks” back in 2009 and is on-going today. It went over the various things that Linux Desktop is missing or can improve on. While it exposed some of Linux Desktop’s early flaws, it also showed a lot of Linux’s charm. For me, it was my first exposure to the thought “Wait… I can use Linux as my desktop?!?”
