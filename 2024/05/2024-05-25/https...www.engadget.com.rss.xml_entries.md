<p>Elon Musk told investors this month that his startup xAI is planning to build a supercomputer by the fall of 2025 that would power a future, smarter iteration of its Grok chatbot, <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/musk-plans-xai-supercomputer-dubbed-gigafactory-of-compute?rc=whf0fd"><em><ins>The Information</ins></em></a> reports. This supercomputer, which Musk reportedly referred to as “a gigafactory of compute,” would rely on tens of thousands of NVIDIA H100 GPUs and cost billions of dollars to build. Musk has <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/teslas-musk-predicts-ai-will-be-smarter-than-smartest-human-next-year-2024-04-08/"><ins>previously said</ins></a> the third version of Grok will take at least 100,000 of the chips to train — a fivefold increase over the 20,000 GPUs said to be in use for training Grok 2.0.</p>

<p><em>Resident Evil 6</em> has sold surprisingly well on the Nintendo Switch since it was ported to the console in 2019, despite it being almost universally panned by fans of the series. As spotted by <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/05/resident-evil-6-has-sold-over-1-million-copies-on-nintendo-switch#comments"><em>Nintendo Life</em></a>, <em>RE6</em> just got added to <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/business/million.html#tab5">Capcom</a>’s Platinum Titles list, meaning it’s crossed the threshold of one million units sold. It sits at number 117 on the list, with a million downloads for the Switch (but not any other platforms).</p>
<p><em>RE6</em> stands out as a convoluted action game next to the titles that came before it, marking a dramatic shift away from survival horror. It has <em>a lot</em> going on, but not so much of the things people actually love about Resident Evil games. It’s gained some defen

<p>ICQ, which used to be a very popular messaging app for a short period in the 90s and the early aughts, only has a month left before it joins the other apps and software of old in the great big farm in the sky. It will stop working on June 26, according to it <a href="https://icq.com/">website</a>, which also encourages users to move to VK Messenger for casual chats and to VK WorkSpace for professional conversations. ICQ came into the picture at a time when most people were using IRC to chat. IRC, however, was mostly meant for group conversations — ICQ made it easy to communicate one-on-one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Users who signed up for an account got assigned a number that grew longer as time went on, because it was issued sequentially. The shortest numbers had five digits, which means users who got them were there at the very beginning. ICQ peaked in the early 2000s when it reached 100 million registered accounts. And while it didn't take a long time for AIM, Yahoo Messenger and MSN Messen

<p><strong><em>The following contains spoilers for “73 Yards.”</em></strong></p>
<p>Russell T. Davies admits his writing eschews narrative formalism in favor of things that just feel right. Two decades ago, his critics pointed to his use of deus ex machina endings as a stick to beat his reputation with. But we’re in a different era now, where <em>vibes</em> matter just as much as logic — both inside the show’s new more fantastic skew, and in the real world. “73 Yards” is the <em>vibiest</em> episode of new <em>Doctor Who</em> so far, but <em>I</em> even found it easy to sit back and enjoy what it was doing.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><em>Doctor Who</em> is a complicated show to make, and some series have started production on Day 1 a week or more behind schedule. To combat this, the show started making “-lite” episodes that didn’t need the leads to be as involved. There are “Doctor-lite” episodes like “Love and Monsters” and “Blink,” and even “companion-lite” episode
