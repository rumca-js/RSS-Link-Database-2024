  <p id="08b4b5">About midway through <a href="https://www.animalwell.net/"><em>Animal Well</em></a>, I felt I had been lied to. I read all the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24152153/animal-well-review-switch-ps5-steam-videogamedunkey">glowing</a> <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24151337/animal-well-review-pc-ps5-switch">reviews</a> of the game and heard the breathless praise heaped upon it on social media. But my expectations did not match my reality... until I beat the game. Now, I’m well on my way to 100 percent completion for a game I was seriously considering abandoning.</p>

  <p id="gokcqh">Social media is abuzz with examples of Google’s new AI Overview product saying weird stuff, from telling users to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/23/24162896/google-ai-overview-hallucinations-glue-in-pizza">put glue on their pizza</a> to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/google/comments/1cziil6/a_rock_a_day_keeps_the_doctor_away/">suggesting they eat rocks</a>.
