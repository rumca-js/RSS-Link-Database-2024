Turnips are mostly grown for their flavoursome green tops in Italy, rather than their crisp roots as in northern Europe, so if you\u2019re lucky enough to find a bunch of cime di rapa or some turnips with their tops, use those here; otherwise, just about any combination of leafy green and/or brassica will do.</p><p>Discover this recipe and many more from your favourite cooks on <a href=\"https://app.adjust.com/1bgiux9n?creative=Endno", "language": "en-US", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/food/article/2024/may/25/how-to-turn-leftover-cooked-sausage-into-a-one-pot-wonder-zero-waste-cooking", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "source_obj__id": 341, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7e33e967b3e48ed07a48cbd8338ea2acf9c5a1e/0_282_3758_2255/master/3758.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0a1c4f7d9b07e6d49fa2ec29f59410d1", "title": "How to turn leftover cooked sausage into a one-pot wonder | Waste not", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-05-25T05:00:15+00:00", "description": "<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/picture/2024/may/25/unused-apps-on-my-phone-edith-pritchett-cartoon\">Continue reading...</a>", "language": "en-US", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/picture/2024/may/25/unused-apps-on-my-phone-edith-pritchett-cartoon", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "source_obj__id": 341, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/347a7b888c1ecdfd260b5a5fd3ee0627b9788ea3/2253_4_1099_660/master/1099.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1c56b54aa57daa4b306b2c72e498b265", "title": "Still quietly charging me \u00a35.99 a week: unused apps on my phone \u2013 Edith Pritchett cartoon", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-05-25T04:45:20+00:00", "description": "<ul><li>New Zealand run in 11 tries during 67-19 rout of Australia</li><li>Jo Yapp\u2019s side relegated to WXV2 to be played in South Africa</li></ul><p>The World Cup dreams of Australia\u2019s women\u2019s rugby side have been dealt a brutal blow by New Zealand after an 11-try demolition dealt them a 67-19 defeat in the final Pacific Four Series match at North Harbour Stadium in Auckland. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/may/11/rusty-wallaroos-walloped-by-canada-in-pacific-four-opener\">The loss leaves the Wallaroos 0-3 under new coach Jo Yapp</a> and drops them out of the top WXV1 division, leaving them to qualify for the 2025 World Cup from the second tier WXV2 to be staged in South Africa over September and October.</p><p>Australia needed a bonus point victory to qualify for WXV1 and had the weight of history against them, having never defeated their Trans Tasman rivals.
