Then build a firewall (OPNSense, etc.). Next is to implement any networking with a switch, reverse proxy, VLANs, etc. Lastly, install clients in Docker, LXC, or whathaveyou and set them up within all the rules and networks created in previous steps.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So, I've tried to setup a few services that offer both, a paid SaaS subscription and a self-hosted solution.</p> <p>I'm a developer, and I am very familiar with Docker and docker-compose, reverse-proxy, etc.</p> <p>Usually the setup goes like this: Copy &amp; paste the docker-compose or docker run command, adapt some envs, and that's it.</p> <p>However, some services are just a chore to set up. Their Docker version doesn't work at all, throws errors or is a PITA to set up.</p> <p>Let's explore some examples:</p> <ul> <li>Sentry: Good luck getting this one running with Portainer. Admittedly, I haven't given it a shot with good ol' docker compose up, yet.</li> <li>LinkStack: No errors. The reverse-proxy hits the apache-server on port 80, but it just gives 404 errors when trying to access the UI</li> <li>Ghost: MigrationsAreLocked error, on a fresh install. Issues dating back to Dec 2023, with no solution.</li> </ul> <p>Are they purposely making it diffi

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So, I've got a friend that has a cheap kimsufi server and refuses to buy a domain name. They wanted a dropbox alternative so I setup nextcloud via the docker container they offer.</p> <p>I'd like to offer some sort of encryption, but since we don't own the domain kimsufi gives we can't get any real certificate. That leave self-signed Not ideal, but better than nothing and I can explain the warning won't go away unless my friend forks over $10 yearly.</p> <p>At the moment though, I'd like to setup a reverse proxy that can offer up a self-signed cert. Everything I've seen is focused around Let's Encrypt and ZeroSSL.</p> <p>Are there any solutions people can suggest that would make setting up a reverse proxy with a self-signed cert as painless as possible? </p> <p>Or; How would you approach this problem?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/OwlFather"> /u/OwlFather </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.r

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi. I'm hoping somebody can point me in the right direction.</p> <p>I have been immeasurably frustrated with online platforms removing the music that I like. Sure, I can back it up manually, and I do, a lot, but ultimately, I don't want to manually download music.<br /> Other solutions, like Arr, seem to require you to proactively pre-download music. As much as Arr is a gift from the universe itself, this is simply not how people listen to music anymore. :/</p> <p>I'm looking for a solution that allows me to do the following:</p> <p>a) play music from online sources (YouTube, SoundCloud, Spotify, torrents, other) hopefully with a decent interface, ideally accessible via an app or at least PWA b) if the song was played more than a certain number of times, or was manually selected, it downloads it locally (perhaps via an Arr solution, or from YouTube using something like <a href="https://github.com/deepjyoti30/ytmdl">ytmdl</a> and sorts it using a certa

I've been thinking already on using smart home stuff to do wake-on-lan when I come back home, but I'm not sure what to do to show my information on it.</p> <p>I'm relying on NextCloud nowadays for most things like agenda, task list and so on, and I'm not a fan of the landing page on NextCloud for this use case.. Anything out there that people have made ? Otherwise I would try to code it myself.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/BraceletGrolf"> /u/BraceletGrolf </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1d08aw1/dashboard_for_agenda_todos_and_so_on/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1d08aw1/dashboard_for_agenda_todos_and_so_on/">[comments]</a></span>

I cannot set up cloudflare for my subdomain from there (it really does not let me), is there an alternative to CF Tunnels that supports subdomain for free, or perhaps any way to use CF Tunnels with a subdomain? I just wouldn't like to expose my public IP to the internet, and also I use Termux for setting up a web server.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have been working on an <a href="https://invoicingapi.com">invoice generating API</a> for over a year now. I didn't properly validate the idea since it started off as just a hobby project, so the initial idea was for it to be available as just an online API living in the cloud. A few months ago I finally released it online and got a ton of suggestions to release a self-hosted version since many users of this kind of service wouldn't want their invoice data being stored in the cloud.</p> <p>I understood where they were coming from and saw the value in it, and I worked with Docker before so I decided to add that in. I consulted with this sub a lot to understand more about the self-hosting concept. A few weeks back I finished implementing it so now the API can live within your environment, ready to create invoices at any moment.</p> <p>I thought it would be fitting to post it here incase anyone here would be interested to learn about it.
