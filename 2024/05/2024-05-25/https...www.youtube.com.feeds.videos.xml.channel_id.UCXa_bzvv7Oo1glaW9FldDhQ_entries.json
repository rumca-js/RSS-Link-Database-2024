This is a soulsborne through and through, with combat more akin to Sekiro set in a semi- open dark fantasy world. \n\nCombat looks sleek and responsive, with stamina breaking making up the core mechanics of the game. What has us most excited is the dynamic environmental destruction that can be used against enemies. Exploration looks pretty fun as well, with vertical terrain and some jumping sequences shown in the trailer. \n\nYou can break stone walls and encounter mobs fighting other enemies in the wild, which goes a long way making the world feel more alive. Hopefully, the game runs smooth at launch, because the trailers show a lot of ray tracing and particle effects. Nonetheless, we\u2019re impressed by The Relic: The First Guardian.", "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rohCyoRCWmE", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "source_obj__id": 129, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/rohCyoRCWmE/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "This Dark Soulsborne Inspired Game Looks ABSOLUTELY STAGGERING", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-05-25T13:30:08+00:00", "description": "Having first launched in September 2014 and seen numerous updates, expansions and overhauls throughout the years, it's shocking that the Destiny franchise has held on for as long as it has. Bungie will conclude the Light and Darkness saga - a story nearly ten years in the making - on June 4th with Destiny 2: The Final Shape.\n\nYet the sheer tenacity for survival it's displayed, whether it's Bungie's many mistakes that take many months to fix or the live-service genre falling out of favor (with a few exceptions), has been impressive. With The Final Shape, the franchise is arguably facing its biggest hurdle in years amid layoffs, controversies and a potential takeover by Sony.\n\nSo, let's look back on the years, the highs and lows of the franchise and ponder how it survived, seemingly against all odds, while its competitors faded into the ether.", "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LadfbRGwEIs", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "source_obj__id": 129, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/LadfbRGwEIs/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "SERIOUSLY, How Is Destiny 2 Still Alive?", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-05-25T09:30:13+00:00", "description": "Much like any other piece of entertainment, games are also bound by the technical constraints of the target hardware. \n\nAnd as the capability of consumer hardware grows, so do the games developed for that platform.
