As of 2023, Meta’s Llama models are open source, which means anyone can access them for free and what’s most important is that they can modify and redistribute their own versions of Llama without Meta’s explicit permission.

This allows for tremendous freedoms. It enables anyone in the world to take Llama and customize it to their own needs, fine-tune it, train it on their own data sets. You don’t need a data center to do this. It’s doable on consumer-grade hardware. 

In contrast, the rest of the big tech is gambling on the believe there will always be enough paying customers. And freely available open source AI is an obstacle to that strategy. So where they can’t win in free market, they turn to the government.
