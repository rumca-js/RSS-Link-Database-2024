Watch Mad Max, Furiosa, and Babe director George Miller pick his favorite shots from his most iconic movies. Filmmaker George Miller made a huge splash in 1979 with the debut of Mad Max, his B movie revenge tale of ‚Äúa cop, a driver‚Äù who goes, well, mad when some very bad things happen to those he loves most. And from there, a franchise was born which continues to this day with Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga.

We sat down with Miller on the eve of the Furiosa movie release to discuss his best shots from some of his best movies, as well as a couple from a pair of favorite movies of that he *didn‚Äôt* direct.

We got our first look at what to expect in terms of graphics, narrative tone for the story, and a clear look at our main protagonist Lucia. We also got a release window for the game, with it coming to us in 2025. But the first trailer for #GTA6 left a lot to be desired. Akeem Lawanson, along with special guest panelists J.D. Witherspoon and Goldenboy take a look at the previous #RockstarGames trailer release schedules for its major AAA games to come up with a speculative yet logical timeline for the second trailer hitting the Internet. This is all barring any sort of leaks that might happen to force Rockstar‚Äôs hand in doing yet another su
