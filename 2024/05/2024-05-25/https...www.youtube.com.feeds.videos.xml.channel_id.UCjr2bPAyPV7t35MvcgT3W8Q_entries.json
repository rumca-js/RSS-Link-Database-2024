Support my work: https://www.patreon.com/thehatedone \nFollow me: https://twitter.com/The_HatedOne_\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/thehatedone/\n\nAs of 2023, Meta\u2019s Llama models are open source, which means anyone can access them for free and what\u2019s most important is that they can modify and redistribute their own versions of Llama without Meta\u2019s explicit permission.\n\nThis allows for tremendous freedoms. It enables anyone in the world to take Llama and customize it to their own needs, fine-tune it, train it on their own data sets. You don\u2019t need a data center to do this. It\u2019s doable on consumer-grade hardware. \n\nIn contrast, the rest of the big tech is gambling on the believe there will always be enough paying customers. And freely available open source AI is an obstacle to that strategy. So where they can\u2019t win in free market, they turn to the government.\n\nSources [reference numbers are in the video transcript]\n\n[1] https://ai.meta.com/bl", "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ_NRIKbRKc", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCjr2bPAyPV7t35MvcgT3W8Q", "source_obj__id": 344, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/lJ_NRIKbRKc/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Mark Zuckerberg Is Unironically Based Now", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
