<p>It is 20 years since Porto beat Monaco in the final – European football’s landscape has changed dramatically since then</p><p>When <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2004/may/27/match.porto">Porto beat Monaco</a> to win the Champions League in 2004, it felt like the start of a new era. And for José Mourinho, it was. He had won the Uefa Cup <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2003/may/21/minutebyminute.sport">the previous season</a>, but that success in Gelsenkirchen was his springboard to points records at Chelsea, a treble with Internazionale and his titanic struggles with Pep Guardiola when he was at Real Madrid. For two decades he has sulked and pouted his way around Europe, and for at least half of that time he was remarkably successful. But for European football as a whole that final marked the end of something.</p><p>In the previous 20 years, the competition had been a genuinely pan-European affair, with winners coming from nine different countries; in th

<p>Italian reflects on the change of attitude that helped him win his first grand slam as he bids for more glory at the French Open</p><p>Jannik Sinner is still only 22 but he strolls in with the serene conviction of a grand slam winner who seems far older than he looks. He is also as friendly as he is serious in a mix that suits the fact that Sinner is an Italian who grew up speaking German and now models for Gucci while sometimes being cheered on by a quirky group of fans who dress like carrots and call themselves the Carota Boys. The carrots honour Sinner’s red hair and the fading memory that he once ate the humble vegetable during a match in Vienna.</p><p>It makes sense to meet Sinner at Roland Garros for it was here, a year ago, that a surprise defeat changed his erratic mentality and set him on a new path of clarity.

The former England goalkeeper should probably have held a long range drive from Paulo Bernardo in the 90th minute at Hampden Park. What Butland absolutely could not do was bat the ball straight to the onrushing Adam Idah. Inexplicably, Butland handed Idah his opportunity. Celtic had precious few in this taut, tense final but took the one that mattered. Brendan Rodgers has secured a double in this, his first season back in Glasgow. Idah, a Norwich City loanee, has written his name into Celtic folklore.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/may/25/celtic-rangers-scottish-cup-final-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>(Free Dirt) <br />The Canadian-Grenadian singer-songwriter’s phenomenal playing underscores strongly personal and political themes on her superb fourth album</p><p>Born in Montreal to a Canadian mother and a Grenadian father, <a href="https://www.kaiakater.com/">Kaia Kater</a> made her name as a banjo revivalist, much celebrated in folk circles as a teenager, though from the outset her backwoods picking came alongside songs with contemporary themes. Her previous album, 2018’s <em>Grenades</em>, looked at the history of her father’s homeland, since when she has become a successful TV and film composer. Now 30, Kater brings her talents into full bloom on this fourth album, which marries dazzling banjo playing with percussion, strings, brass and more – a subtle kaleidoscope of sound over which her voice floats melodically but often accusingly.</p><p>The songs are a clever mix of personal and political.

It’s about the alternative as well.”</p><p>The off-the-cuff remark was telling. After more than half a century in national politics, Joe Biden’s final campaign is defined not by his record but his opponent: Donald Trump.

<p>What to do with a leftover barbecued sausage? Add broccoli and beans for a quick and easy midweek meal</p><p>Just one cooked sausage, left over from a barbecue, or indeed any meal, is enough to make this simple one-pot wonder inspired by the Italian classic <em>orecchiette con salsiccia e cime di rapa</em>. In the original, raw sausage is skinned, broken into pieces and fried with cime di rapa (turnip tops), then tossed with cooked orecchiette. Being a bean fiend, however, I’ve come up with an even speedier version using creamy butter beans instead of pasta. Turnips are mostly grown for their flavoursome green tops in Italy, rather than their crisp roots as in northern Europe, so if you’re lucky enough to find a bunch of cime di rapa or some turnips with their tops, use those here; otherwise, just about any combination of leafy green and/or brassica will do.</p><p>Discover this recipe and many more from your favourite cooks on <a href="https://app.adjust.com/1bgiux9n?creative=Endno
