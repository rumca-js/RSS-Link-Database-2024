<p>The former world champion tells Giles Richards how he could have won that epic 1992 Senna duel around the streets of Monte Carlo</p><p>The Monaco Grand Prix is the race many Formula One drivers want to win most but for Nigel Mansell it was always the one that got away. The former world champion has no regrets, however: well, perhaps that he didn’t quite go far enough during his magnificent battle with Ayrton Senna on the streets of Monte Carlo in 1992.</p><p>“We got so close and he blocked so well, and badly,” Mansell recalls. “All these years later I think perhaps I should have just nudged him up the back at one of the corners. If we had switched sides and Ayrton had been following me I feel sure he would have knocked me at one of the corners, but it was still a fantastic race.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/may/25/nigel-mansell-ayrton-could-block-like-a-double-decker-bus-at-monaco">Continue reading...</a>

<p>What did it look like when the allies pushed to take Europe back from the Nazis? We know thanks to this stunning footage from brave journalists and Hollywood directors who crossed the beaches with their cameras</p><p>We haven’t merely read and heard about the Normandy landings of 6 June 1944, when allied troops arrived on the coast of northern France to begin a push across occupied Europe that would help to defeat the Nazis. We can see exactly what that day looked like: the barges crammed with soldiers, the jagged log posts and asterisk-shaped steel barriers sticking out of the low-tide water, the men wading, stumbling and running up the beaches under heavy fire from the clifftops. The images are available, but somebody had to capture them.

<p>Tory MPs are perplexed: this seemed the worst moment to go to the country. Has their leader simply had enough?</p><p>Two days after Rishi Sunak stood in Downing Street to announce an early general election, only for the heavens to open, Tory MPs in the Palace of Westminster were still scratching their heads in disbelief.</p><p>“Why did he do it? We were all told it would be the autumn and were hoping that by then we could turn things round. It is very perplexing,” said one former minister, frowning. Others said they were simply not ready to fight a campaign and that they couldn’t raise the money in time.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/may/25/how-rishi-sunaks-early-election-backfired-on-pm">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From Reform and Redwood to a Titanic misstep, early electioneering has  offered much unintentional hilarity</p><p>Every election needs some questionable statistics. Lovers of crimes against line graphs will be pleased to hear of one from Reform UK showing migration since 1066, which missed out migration spikes long before William the Conk was even a twinkle in the Duke eye. A major peak came, for instance, about 25,000 years ago, when the population went up from zero – a startling increase – and Reform also had nothing to say about the Romans, Anglo-Saxons or Beakers. And why leave the Vikings out? Reform’s obsession with small boats might have actually captured the zeitgeist.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/may/25/election-diary-satirists-must-be-in-despair-after-tory-campaigns-first-comedic-days">Continue reading...</a>

 The key with the filling for a jacket potato is to use something that is, er, filling (which is why tuna or baked beans work so well) and to have a rich, creamy element that brings everything together, which is why mayonnaise is such a classic combo with tuna and grated cheese with beans.</p><p>Try that mayo with a different protein, though – it works especially well with leftover roast chicken, chopped ham or prawns, say.

<p>Small islands like ours face an uncertain future. We can adapt – but climate finance that we badly need must be unlocked</p><ul><li>Mohamed Muizzu is the president of the Maldives</li></ul><p>For the Maldives, the existential threat of the climate crisis, particularly sea level rise, has been a reality we have grappled with for decades. In 1989, recognising the urgency of our situation, with our islands standing just one metre above sea level, we brought this issue to the global stage for the <a href="https://www.islandvulnerability.org/slr1989.html#:~:text=Small%20States%20Conference%20on%20Sea,November%201989%2C%20Male%2C%20the%20Maldives">first time</a>.</p><p>This early recognition of our vulnerability sparked a national transformation as we embarked on proactive climate resilience and adaptation measures. Thirty-five years later, has the rest of the world truly been listening? If you look at how the world’s reaction to the climate crisis is funded, the answer is clearly “no”.<

<p>Polish world No 1 thrashes so many of her opponents that a third consecutive French Open title seems inevitable</p><p>Before Madison Keys faced Iga Swiatek at the Italian Open this month, she was asked what adjustments she would make against the best player in the world. She did not need time to consider her response: “Win more games.”</p><p>Even that simple goal turned out to be too ambitious. Twelve days after Swiatek had dismantled Keys 6-1, 6-3 in Madrid, she again handled the American with disdain in Rome, producing exactly the same scoreline. Still, Keys could hardly be upset. If the past few years of women’s tennis have shown players one thing, it is that when a confident, in-form Swiatek is standing on the other side of the net, things can always be worse.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/may/25/welcome-to-iga-swiateks-bakery-where-bagels-and-breadsticks-are-always-on-the-menu">Continue reading...</a>

The funicular railway up the cliff has a queue of Hasidic Jewish families clutching ice-creams, and the pier is packed with good-humoured Brummies enjoying the snooker tables and push-penny machines, waiting for the nightclub, Pier Pressure, to open.
