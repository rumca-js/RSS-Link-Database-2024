I colorized, restored and created the sound for this video of Cambridge, England 1924. You can see various views of the city of Cambridge and its universities.

Video Restoration Process:
âœ” FPS boosted to 60 frames per second 
âœ” Image resolution boosted up to HD 
âœ” Improved video sharpness and brightness 
âœ” Colorized only for the ambiance (not historically accurate)
âœ”added sound design only for the ambiance
âœ”restoration:(stabilisation,denoise,cleand,deblur) 
âœ” Face Restoration

Please, be aware that colorization colors are not real and fake, colorization was made only for the ambiance and do not represent real historical data.
