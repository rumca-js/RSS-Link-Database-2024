Sublime grid-filling puzzle series Picross is returning to Switch this month for another retro-themed collaboration, developer Jupiter this time teaming up with Bandai Namco to release Picross S: Namco Legendary Edition on 30th May.
</p><p>
Much like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-an-official-mega-drive-and-master-system-themed-picross-game-heading-to-switch-next-week">2021's Picross S: Mega Drive &amp; Master System Edition</a>, Namco Legendary Edition takes Picross' classic puzzle action - in which players use number clues to correctly fill in squares on a grid and complete a picture - and gives it a retro-inspired twist, albeit this time develing in Namco's illustrious archive of classic games.
</p><p>
30 Namco titles will be represented across a total of 585 puzzles, with the likes of Pac-Man, Dig Dug, Galaga, Xevi

Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League might not have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-fails-to-meet-warner-bros-expectations">done the numbers Warner Bros was expecting</a>, but developer Rocksteady continues onward with its post-launch plans, with its imminent Season 1 - Episode 2 update introducing new enemies, new gears, and more.
</p><p>
Season 1 - Episode 2 is a mid-season update for Kill the Justice League, and follows the<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-leagues-first-season-kicks-off-with-the-joker-this-month"> arrival of The Joker as a playable character</a> at the end of March. As such, it's light on major headline features, but it does bring a few gameplay additions while players wait for the next big update.

A new year means a new Call of Duty, meaning Activision Blizzard is going to have to get around to unveiling it at some point. Reports are suggesting that 'some point' will almost certainly be during Microsoft's Xbox showcase this June, but before then, the first teaser has seemingly now been spotted in an unassuming corner of the internet.
</p><p>
More specifically, a likely new Call of Duty 2024 teaser site has emerged (thanks <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1793301871429382299">Charlie Intel</a>) at <a href="https://thetruthlies.com/1/">TheTruthLies.com</a>, where visitors are able to fiddle with some buttons on a TV set and watch a quick blast of mysterious footage.

Currently, only one of the TV's six channels shows footage when selected, and there's no explicit Call of Duty branding to definitively confi

Helldivers 2 developer Arrowhead has a new CEO.
</p><p>
Earlier today, it was announced that Shams Jorjani - who was previously part of the team that published Arrowhead's game, Magicka - will take over the leadership role at the company, replacing founder Johan Pilestedt. 
</p><p>
Pilestedt will remain in a leadership position following this change, and will now serve as Arrowhead's chief creative officer and chairman.

## Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door - Is the drop to 30fps justified by the visual upgrades?

<img src="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/PAPER-SITE.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" /> <p>A beloved GameCube classic from 2004, Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door has been deemed worthy of a new release on Nintendo Switch a full 20 years later. Original developer Intelligent Systems is at the helm here, substantially reworking its visuals, rearranging its soundtrack and adding a suite of bonus extras via a new gallery section. It's a fittingly lavish upgrade for a game that still holds up today, with its charming paper and card aesthetic, interesting combat system, and captivating level design. Unfortunately, the visual upgrades come with a stiff frame-rate penalty, with the original 60fps target on GameCube dropping to 30fps on Switch. Was that the right move, or is it too severe of a cut? We've tested the opening chapters to deliver an early verdict. </p><p>To cut to the chase, Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door is one of the

Fortnite's new season - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-is-coming-to-fortnite">which includes a Fallout collaboration</a> - kicks off on Friday, and we've now gotten a glimpse of how the T-60 Power Armour will look in-game.

A brief snippet of gameplay footage - our first from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-chapter-5-season-3-estimated-release-date-9406">Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 3</a> - shows the iconic armour as seen in the Fallout games and recent TV series, stomping towards the camera.

Fortnite fans may note this location is a much-changed version of Snooty Steppes, wrecked by the upcoming arrival of an enormous sandstorm.

## V Rising review - a wickedly deep, generous, and satisfying vampire fantasy

On a surface level, it sounded great: a vampire survival fantasy where you awaken after a centuries-long sleep to eat your way through a world. It has castle building, thematic survival systems like staying out of the sun and drinking people's blood, and you can transform into animals and wield magic. On top of that, it plays a bit like a Diablo or Hades. Great - I'm here for all of that. What I'm not here for - and what nearly staked my vampire fantasy in the heart before it began - is tedious resource gathering and crafting donkey work. I hacked trees and mined ore and carted them across maps, then I waited and waited for materials to process. It seemed every few steps of progress I made was interrupted by a grind I couldn't escape, and my enthusiasm drained like blood from a jugular bec

Twitch will now let users filter out or blur unwanted content.
</p><p>
Last year, Twitch introduced Content Classification Labels for streamers to tag their streams accordingly. Now these can be used to filter out streams that include mature content, sexual themes, gambling, drug use, and more.
</p><p>
Further, there's now an option to blur stream thumbnails with sexual themes, so your homepage won't be filled with inappropriate imagery.

Deadlock, the unannounced but previously-leaked hero shooter from Half-Life maker Valve, has been spotted again in a fresh leak. And, this time, we can now see gameplay footage of Deadlock in action.
</p><p>
Leaked <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/images-leak-of-valves-next-game-and-its-an-overwatch-style-hero-shooter">details of Deadlock sprung onto the internet last week</a> via images posted to social media and a report from longterm Valve reporter Tyler McVicker, which claimed that Deadlock was currently in closed testing. 
</p><p>
It's from this ongoing test that gameplay footage has now also leaked - showing off Deadlock's training mode, more hero characters, and the existence of BioShock Infinite-style skyrails you can hook onto and ride around on.

Smash Bros. fighters have an almost equal chance of winning a match, creator Masahiro Sakurai has said.

</p><p>
The video includes win rate data from across the globe, revealing the highest win rate is 51.43 percent and the lowest win rate is 47.18 percent. It means all 87 characters sit within this win/loss ratio, hovering around an equal 50 percent chance of winning.

Hey everyone. At 5pm yesterday, it was announced that the Gamer Network family of websites - Eurogamer, GamesIndustry.biz, VG247, Rock Paper Shotgun and Dicebreaker - had been acquired by a new owner, IGN Entertainment. 
</p><p>
This was not unexpected. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/editors-blog-eurogamer-owner-seeking-buyer">Gamer Network had been publicly up for sale for a few months</a>, as you may recall, after our previous parent company Reedpop decided to divest the websites it bought alongside EGX. 
</p><p>
And IGN Entertainment, which alongside its flagship website also runs a bunch of other long-running brands like Humble Bundle, Mashable, Lifehacker and PCMag, had always seemed a possible buyer.

The more you play Simogo's logic puzzle game, the more unexpected complexity you find folded in it, flattened neatly into an unassuming, pretty exterior. You've arrived at an aristocratic hotel in Europe. Your handbag carries keys for your car that won't start, and tampons. You're missing all of the important answers, like where, when, or who you are, but the puzzle of your existence is at first only unsettling. Then it consumes you.</p><p>How could it not? Lorelai and the Laser Eyes is a proud puzzle game. Everything in it is a supernatural puzzle, from discovering who brought you to the hotel to figuring out how to pour complimentary espresso. But the game most commonly relies on math puzzles which, to their credit, can often stand on their own outside the context of the g
