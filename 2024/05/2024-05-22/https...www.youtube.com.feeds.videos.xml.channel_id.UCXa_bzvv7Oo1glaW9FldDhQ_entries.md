With the summer gaming showcases coming up, it's interesting to look back on the year thus far and the state of various titles after the dust has settled. Unfortunately, one such title - Rocksteady Studios' Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League - is even worse off than before.

From a mixed critical response and falling short of Warner Bros. Discovery's expectations to a lackluster first season and $200 million impact on the company's revenue, things keep getting worse for the embattled live-service looter shooter. Perhaps worst of all, however, is that its player base has dwindled to embarrassing lows, barely hitting 400 peak concurrent players on Steam.

That's worse than its competitors, never mind titles like The Division, which is years older. As Season of the Joker's next episode approaches, one has to wonder if its parent company will pull the plug early and cut its losses.

## 5 Years Later, IS DAYS GONE FINALLY FIXED?

When Bend Studio's Days Gone launched for the PS4 in 2019, it was under the shadow of many great first-party titles. Though its combat, zombies/Freakers and overall graphical fidelity attracted praise, critics found the open world and story lacking. The iffy performance and technical issues also didn't help.

Despite positive sales out of the gate, Days Gone seemed like it would be confined to history as one of Sony's few underwhelming exclusives. Nevertheless, it garnered a strong cult following, culminating in its addition to PlayStation Plus, where it gained a new appreciation. Though a sequel looks unlikely (especially following reports of a rejected pitch), it's still considered one of the more underrated exclusives.

All these years later, how does Days Gone measure up? What did its numerous patches add over time, and is it worth playing? Find out more here.
