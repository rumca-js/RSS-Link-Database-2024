Delightfully clear explanation of a simple automated prompt optimization strategy from Jason Liu. Gather a selection of examples and build an evaluation function to return a numeric score (the hard bit). Then try different shuffled subsets of those examples in your prompt and look for the example collection that provides the highest averaged score.

<p><a href="https://maven.com/parlance-labs/fine-tuning">Mastering LLMs: A Conference For Developers &amp; Data Scientists</a></p>
I’m speaking at this 5-week (maybe soon 6-week) long online conference about LLMs, presenting about “LLMs on the command line”.</p>

<p>Other speakers include Jeremy Howard, Sophia Yang from Mistral, Wing Lian of Axolotl, Jason Liu of Instructor, Paige Bailey from Google, my former co-worker John Berryman and a growing number of fascinating LLM practitioners.</p>

<p>It’s been fun watching this grow from a short course on fine-tuning LLMs to a full-blown multi-week conference over the past few days!
