<p>This year marks the 60th anniversary of The Munsters, a TV series that had higher ratings than The Addams Family when both shows shared the airwaves. However, The Munsters haven't quite been able to recapture the charm of the original series since it went off the air in 1966 despite numerous attempts to reboot the show. Now, James Wan is going to try his hand at new version of The Munsters that embraces horror over comedy.</p><p>Via <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/05/the-munsters-reboot-ucp-1235926179/">Deadline</a>, Wan, Lindsey Anderson Beer, and Ingrid Bisu are developing The Munsters' dark reboot for Universal Content Productions, a division of NBCUniversal. The new series is currently called 1313, after the address of the Munsters' home on 1313 Mockingbird Lane. Beer is set to be the showrunner of the series if it goes forward. </p><p>If the premise of 1313 sounds familiar, it's because Bryan Fuller and director Bryan Singer attempted to do a dark reboot of The Munsters in

<p>The premiere of Star Wars: The Acolyte is still a few weeks away, and for now, we don't know why a former Padawan learner named Mae (Amandla Stenberg) has such a grudge against the Jedi that she's attacked several of their number. Mae isn't a Jedi or a Sith, and she seems to have some talent with the Force. But even Mae's Force abilities pale in comparison to her former mentor, Jedi Master Sol (Lee Jung-jae), in a new preview clip from The Acolyte.</p><div>          </div><p>It doesn't seem to take Sol very much effort to evade Mae's best strikes.

She's outmatched, and now she's also disarmed.</p><p>The fight chorography is also impressive in this scene, especially because it doesn't resort to using quick cuts every few seconds.

<p>Super Smash Bros. players are well-known for their strong opinions on character balance, and it seems that Masahiro Sakurai is no different. In a recent video on game design, Sakurai says that trying to make everything "fair" will produce a less interesting game. Or, as he puts it: "Average and mediocre are the same thing."</p><p>In the video, Sakurai explains that having characters with different sets of strengths and weaknesses gives the game a sense of "push-and-pull." He cites an example of a Mario vs. Mario mirror match--while it resolves these "balance issues," it also creates a static experience. He also calls the internet an "echo chamber of sorts," stating that players tend to believe community opinions of relative strength, even when they aren't necessarily true.</p><div>          </div><p>To support his arguments, Sakurai revealed some interesting data regarding the relative win rates of each character in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/super-smash-bros-ultimate/
