More Moment Of Inertia = Tighter Music!

And yeah, i could have discussed a few things better in the video: I think the way to design a wheel like this would be to always leave the hub on the shaft and then just add the spokes/OD perimeter in pie sections, lets say 6 or 8 sections. So we are not disassembling the shaft and gearing/timing belt at all, we are just removing/adding stupid pieces of heavy metal to the hub. The alignment/balancing of the wheel *should be easy*TM to get well within requirements. And the reduced need for speed will also help. We can put most of the weight on the OD where it is doing most work.

In a way this was the final missing piece for me personally, the visual identity is in place. All that remains is to grind everyday for a couple of years here we go!
