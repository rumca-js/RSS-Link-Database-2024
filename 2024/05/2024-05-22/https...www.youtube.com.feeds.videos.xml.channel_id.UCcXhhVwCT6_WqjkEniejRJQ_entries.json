So we are not disassembling the shaft and gearing/timing belt at all, we are just removing/adding stupid pieces of heavy metal to the hub. The alignment/balancing of the wheel *should be easy*TM to get well within requirements. And the reduced need for speed will also help. We can put most of the weight on the OD where it is doing most work.\n\nIn a way this was the final missing piece for me personally, the visual identity is in place. All that remains is to grind everyday for a couple of years here we go!\n\nSupport Wintergatan:\n- Patreon \u25ba https://patreon.com/Wintergatan\n- Youtube membership \u25ba https://bit.ly/4cQVM7C\n\nMarble Machine Engineering Discord Server:\nhttps://discord.com/invite/7aSFJA6bkH\n\nVideo edit", "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-doY1Q73B6Y", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCcXhhVwCT6_WqjkEniejRJQ", "source_obj__id": 393, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/-doY1Q73B6Y/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "What is Moment of Inertia?
