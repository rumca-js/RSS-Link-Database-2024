NVIDIA is absolutely everywhere. They've flooded-out competition in the gaming space for years, and we wouldn't be surprised if NVIDIA applies a similar total market assault to AI or other sectors. Today though, we're focusing on how NVIDIA has overrun AMD (and, to a less observable extent, of course Intel Arc) in the gaming GPU business. #NVDA has been stretching some of its launch timelines and overlapping its GPU generations more lately, and we think they might be using the prior generation to fulfill the low-end market for the current options. This video makes a number of judgment calls on analyzing data over about 14 years for NVIDIA vs. AMD launches, embargo dates, and prices. We cannot perfectly encapsulate everything because it requires subjectivity to determine which cards qualify for analysis, but we think this gives a good overall picture.
