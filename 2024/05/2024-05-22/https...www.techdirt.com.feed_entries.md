Generally speaking, a private company&#8217;s press release is not &#8220;news.&#8221; If anyone wants to watch companies stroke themselves off in public, there are plenty of sites dedicated to that kink. If it&#8217;s cop tech purveyors seeking to redeem themselves after a bunch of negative press and/or the loss of high-profile government contracts, we should be [&#8230;]

While lawmakers, looking to get on cable TV, spent much of the last few years performatively hyperventilating about TikTok privacy and national security issues, few of those same folks seem quite as bothered by the parade of obvious, nasty vulnerabilities in the nation’s telecom networks.
