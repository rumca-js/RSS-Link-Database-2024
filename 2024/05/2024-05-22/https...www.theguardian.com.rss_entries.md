<p>The transformation of John Woodcock exposes the authoritarian potential that can lurk in Britain’s centre left</p><p>During the final, beleaguered stages of the last Labour government, one of the stern young party functionaries who used to cluster protectively around the prime minister, Gordon Brown, on his visits to public places was John Woodcock, then one of Brown’s special advisers. Despite the government’s disintegrating poll ratings, Woodcock still had that New Labour cockiness, giving journalists disdainful glances as he strode past in a close-fitting suit.</p><p>At the 2010 election, despite Brown’s defeat, Woodcock became MP for the relatively safe Labour seat of Barrow and Furness. Three years later I interviewed him there for an article about the defence industry, of which he was a strong supporter, partly because Barrow is where Britain’s nuclear submarines are built. He was surprisingly affable company – perhaps seeking election had softened him – but his unyielding, m

<p>Asking friends of all persuasions to define what a populist is brought up a surprising sense of unity</p><p>I was on the radio discussing the attempt on the life of the Slovakian prime minister Robert Fico. Mr Fico, we kept saying, was a populist. This much we knew. But I thought it prudent to check the definition of populism. The Chambers dictionary has a populist as: “A person who believes in the right and ability of the common people to play a major part in government.” This feels disappointingly broad to me, if only insomuch as you can’t imagine a politician saying the opposite – that they didn’t believe in the right and ability of the common people to govern themselves. Google, its dictionary provided by Oxford Languages which is responsible for the Oxford English Dictionary, isn’t much more help. “A political approach that strives to appeal to ordinary people who feel that their concerns are disregarded by established elite groups.” This too is surely standard stuff from poli

<p><strong>Cannes film festival</strong><br />Miguel Gomes’s beguiling and bewildering story follows a jittery fiance fleeing his intended across the British empire, and her hot pursuit</p><p>Once again, Portuguese auteur Miguel Gomes delivers a film in which the most complex sophistication coexists with innocence and charm. It is at once very worldly and yet unworldly – in fact almost childlike at times. It is elegant, eccentric and needs some time to be indulged. The British characters are played by Portuguese actors speaking Portuguese, except for a few rousing choruses of the Eton Boating Song, which is in English. (There is more literal casting for other nationalities.) And yes, it is six parts beguiling to one part exasperating. But quite unlike any other film in the Cannes competition, it leaves you with a gentle, bemused smile on your face.<br /><br />
 The story, co-written by Gomes, could be adapted from something by Somerset Maugham, but is in fact an original screenplay. (

<p>Has architecture taken over the bloom bonanza? Our critic finds an elfin treehouse, a pixie grotto, a Roman villa and a £160,000 shepherd’s hut (with spa) now competing with the delphiniums</p><p>A gigantic Chinese dragon made of gnarled chunks of driftwood towers over a display of bog plants, puffing steam from its nostrils and clutching a ceramic pearl that gushes with water. Nearby, men dressed in togas patrol the courtyard of a pretend Roman villa, where simulated rain pours into the garden from a pantiled roof. Around the corner, a waterfall cascades down an artificial rock face, creating an arresting backdrop to a display of luxury outdoor sofa cushions.<br /><br />

Burton, a theoretical physicist, co-founded the Ideas Roadshow platform with his wife Irena in 2012, and this is their first narrative film: a detailed disquisition on Raphael’s life and times that, while in some ways resembling an extended evening-class lecture with nifty PowerPoint graphics, is clear and informative enough to hold the attention – though perhaps you might need a break every now and then.</p><p>Burton is not an art historian by training (though does hold an MA in philosophy) and while you might class him as a knowledgable amateur he commits fully, amassing as much as seems humanly possible fro

<p>Documentary, basically an extended ‘audience with’, is less revealing than Star Trek devotees might wish but he’s a charismatic raconteur</p><p>He has lived long and prospered. Now 93 years old (though looking like a slip of a lad of 70), William Shatner shares his wit and wisdom in a new documentary that is basically an audience with the great man. Sitting alone in a huge darkened warehouse space, he rambles on uninterrupted. It’s perhaps less fun than you might have hoped for, though Shatner is undoubtedly charismatic, and a pretty decent raconteur. He’s often entertaining, if not always necessarily in the way he intended. Here he is on acting, explaining that if he could win any award it would be for “keeping my inner child alive”. He’s deadly serious, I think.</p><p>He speaks like this, with a spoofy quality that is very easy to poke fun at. But Shatner is not completely un-self-aware. He’s made a late career out of playing the part of William Shatner, the man with a famously i

## Benson Boone review – echoes of Harry Styles in pop’s newest star

<p><strong>Kentish Town Forum, London<br /></strong>His song Beautiful Things has been a global hit this year and, looking like Paul Mescal meets Mario, the US singer has the voice and charm to go even further</p><p>‘I see you winning American Idol if you want,” judge Katy Perry told Benson Boone when he was on the show in 2021. He pulled out of the running, not wanting to be known for being a talent show winner, but fame was written in the stars regardless. Soon he had viral tracks on TikTok and had been taken under the wing of Imagine Dragons’ Dan Reynolds, who mentored him on how to write songs and signed him to his Warner imprint.</p><p>These are early days for Boone and tonight, the sold-out UK date on his first world tour is a solid display of his straightforward commercial appeal and strong vocal ability. There is no obvious marketing shtick or sorrowful backstory but the class he’s entering doesn’t require those: he’s an everyman musician in the vein of a Lewis Capaldi or Hozi

<p><strong>Young Vic, London<br /></strong>Giles Terera is sublime as the guitar-wielding musician looking back on his tearaway years in this rowdy production</p><p>You can’t take your eyes off him. The script for this autobiography of an artist isn’t always nuanced but Giles Terera as its narrator is sublime, filling every line with the weight of time passed, every move with the knowledge of mistakes made. And he has a cracking turn on the electric guitar.</p><p>Performed on Broadway in 2008, Stew’s coming-of-age rock musical leapfrogs through styles and genres as Terera’s character watches a younger version of himself (Keenan Munn-Francis) flee the limits of his cosy middle-class life in 70s LA to a highly American ideal of Europe. First it’s Amsterdam, then Berlin, as he tries on different selves in an attempt to find himself through sex, drugs and radical performance art. The rowdiness and high-energy performances amp up every moment under Liesl Tommy’s bright, imaginative directi

What David Bowie had for dinner, or which item was most prized when hardworking rockers had a food fight in the studio? The answers might all be found in Tiffany Murray’s highly entertaining memoir of a rock’n’roll childhood; or might not, depending what you think of the fallibility of memory.</p><p>Murray’s formative years were spent spying on 1970s rock nobility because her mother, Joan, was the prized cordon-bleu chef at two recording studios, serving gourmet dinners to sometimes unappreciative musos. Joan’s elegant cream-enhanced seafood dishes were regularly rejected by those whose facial hair alone precluded them from making judgments of taste.

We see her here also playing herself and acting in what is evidently supposed to be a homage to Anita Ekberg’s Trevi fountain scene from Fellini’s La Dolce Vita, in which Marcello famously starred. She feels haunted by her father and has a dream in which her face turns into Marcello’s in the bathroom mirror; actually, it is not much of a change. She confesses how unhappy she is about her “Marcello” face to her mother, Deneuve, who reassuringly says that, yes

<p>The No Mow May campaign has persuaded local authorities to protect biodiversity. But bigger changes are needed</p><p>This time last year, residents of the council estate where I live in Greenwich were left in tears after local authority contractors mowed down scores of newly planted purple alliums on our shared lawn just days after they’d bloomed. In minutes, one man with a strimmer had reduced the flowers that my neighbours, many of whom do not have private gardens, had grown over months to mere mulch.</p><p>Shamefaced, this year the council sought to make amends by sowing a biodiversity meadow near where the alliums had met their fate. The new wildflowers were doing well – on track to compensate for the previous year’s blunder – until, to the consternation of residents, they were yet again mown down by council contractors. Even the local authorities’ own efforts to improve the biodiversity of the borough proved no match for its trigger-happy lawnmower men.</p><p>Phineas Harper is

<p>A baffling misunderstanding of the charm and appeal of the grouchy cartoon cat is one of many reasons to hate this atrocious new take, along with the many, many ads</p><p>There’s not that much to Garfield. Understanding the orange tabby of funny-pages repute is pretty simple: he has a set of integral, inalienable traits – his ill temperament, his cynical outlook, his sedentary lifestyle, his motivation primarily in self-interest and his indifference to owner Jon Arbuckle – that define the grouchy yet likable pop-cultural fixture. Any depiction of a Garfield that eschews these qualities, even while adhering to such superficial markers as his love of lasagne or hatred of Mondays, ceases to be Garfield at all and instead becomes a common cat by any other name, no different than Get Fuzzy’s Bucky, or worse, the godless bastard Heathcliff. In fact, insofar as Garfield-ness is inscribed from the feline personality model projected on to cats by humans, a Garfield in spite of himself may a

When the truth of this groundbreaking event was questioned, I decided to investigate</p><p>One hundred years ago this week, a cellist sat in the gathering gloom of her garden in Surrey, and played. She did so most evenings, by the ivy-clad tree in the woods surrounded by bluebells. But that evening she was not alone. More than a million people were listening. This was Beatrice Harrison, one of the finest players of her generation, and it was not a solo performance but a duet. She had found that when she played outside a nightingale would visit the garden and would join her. And in a moment that made broadcasting history, she was about to share it with listeners from across the Commonwealth. It would become one of the most successful broadcasts of all time.</p><p>So when in 1992 the Mail on Sunday published an article that claimed the whole thing had been faked, i

<p>The Basques work wonders with fresh peas: try them with fried cod, fino and jamón, pork belly with fried eggs, goat’s cheese toasts or in crab and pea rice</p><p>As with any proud Basque, peas have played a huge part in my culinary education – they even feature in one of my earliest kitchen memories, of five-year-old me podding peas with my mother. In fact, I’d go so far as to say that peas are one of the most important ingredients in our cooking tradition, and we happily eat them for breakfast, brunch, lunch and dinner, as well as a raw snack. Every spring, we Basques turn into pea-obsessives, because that’s when <em>guisantes</em> <em>lágrima </em>come into season. They’re much smaller than regular peas, and much, much sweeter, and we cook them every which way, from roasting and frying to stews and salads – they’re so revered that we call them “green caviar”. Lágrima peas are next to impossible to get hold of in the UK, but that’s not to say you can’t use fresh British peas in si

<p>A dazzling account of the dreamers and divas who brought a queer sensibility to culture – and changed lives in the process</p><p>‘The dancing was of the usual superlative quality. Them queers sure can break a leg.” So went a report from a dance organised by the Gay Liberation Front in New York in 1970, quoted in Jon Savage’s new book. With kaleidoscopic detail and exhilarating verve, he tells the intertwined, transatlantic story of pop and the struggle for LGBTQ+ emancipation. The narrative stretches from 1955 and the emergence of Little Richard – the rock’n’roll pioneer who from boyhood was known as “a sissy, punk, freak and faggot” – to the ascent of the gender-blurring disco star Sylvester in 1978, whose anthem You Make Me Feel (Mighty Real) Savage aptly describes as “a major gay liberation statement”.</p><p>Savage is a former music journalist for Sounds who wrote <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/05/englands-dreaming-jon-savage-book-that-changed-me">En

<p>In the 1950s and 60s, his songs stunned and delighted listeners with their irreverence, wit and nihilism. Then he gave it all up to teach mathematics. Lehrer is still alive at 96 – so I went in search of answers</p><p>In 1959, at the stifling, snobbish Jesuit boarding school to which my loving parents had unwisely subcontracted my care, Tom Lehrer’s songs burst upon my consciousness like a clown in a cathedral. Days there began with mass, and ended with an uplifting homily in the chapel from an elderly and skeletal priest, generally about death. “Your best friends will desert you leaving you nothing but a winding sheet,” was one of his more cheerful messages. Between the two there was catechism, rugby, occasional bullying and fairly frequent beatings.</p><p>But we had the “playroom”, where we could relax and listen to records, and one day an American boy called Ed Monaghan turned up clutching Lehrer’s first LP. It was a medicinal dose of the irreverence, nihilism and rebellion that

<p>I usually love to gawp at rich people and their wallpaper, but this British version of the real-estate reality show Selling Sunset is tired, tone-deaf and shamefully crass. Watching it will work you up into a total rage</p><p>I hate almost everything about Buying London, the British version of Netflix’s highly successful Selling Sunset, in which grotesquely wealthy people buy property in Los Angeles from glamorous real estate agents whose personalities are plucked from the reality TV presets menu. I hate that it bases all of its dramatic tension on pitting women against each other. I hate that it makes Richard Curtis’s film Notting Hill look like a gritty documentary about the mean streets of London. I hate its England-for-dummies shtick that is clearly pitched at an international market. I hate its reverence for billionaires and bad taste, its celebrity name-dropping without actual celebrities, even the lurching drone footage that seems to have been shot by the Red Arrows.</p><p>W

<p>Devotees turned out in their droves but a heaviness has followed the Tottenham manager from the other side of the world</p><p>The Olympic Room – with its gleaming panels and glass walls – overlooks the Melbourne Cricket Ground arena, the mecca of Australian sport. It was filled on Tuesday lunchtime with business, political and civic leaders, as well as those who had paid for the privilege of being there. Three hundred or so of Melbourne’s most influential mingled, waiting patiently.</p><p>Sponsors spoke, so too a minister. Then it was time. Slick haircuts swivelled, suit seams strained and heels lifted to get a better view. Onto the stage walked a stocky, clearly jet-lagged man wearing a jumper. In the audience, like Swifties at the same venue earlier this year, these Angees reached for their iPhones. Ange Postecoglou was home again.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/may/22/ange-postecoglou-australia-return-mcg-press-conference-tottenham-hotspur-vs-newc
