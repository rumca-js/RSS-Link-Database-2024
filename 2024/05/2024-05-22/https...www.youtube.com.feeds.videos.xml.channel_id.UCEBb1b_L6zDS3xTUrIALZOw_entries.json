This episode was created by first-year students as a semester-long project in the course SP.360 Terrascope Radio as part of MIT Terrascope, a learning community for first-year undergraduate students focused on solving complex environmental problems. (For more information on the Terrascope learning community and its approach to student-led problem-solving, check out our interview with Dr. Ari Epstein in Season 5 Episode 5, which we\u2019re releasing simultaneously with this special episode!)

Yes and no! \u201cWe don't do a lot of teaching,\u201d says Dr. Ari Epstein, our guest for this week\u2019s episode. Dr. Epstein is associate director of the Terrascope program, a learning community for first-year undergraduates. Each year the program focuses on one particular issue relating to sustainability, and participants in the program learn by direct experience, launching themselves into projects focused on solving complex environmental problems. The role of the program\u2019s instructional staff, Dr. Epstein says, is to create an environment where learning can happen, rather than to impart knowledge or teach skills directly. Toward the end of the semester, the students create a website describing their proposed solutions in as much technical detail as they can. And then a week later, they present their proposals in front of an invited panel of outside experts. In the process of preparing for this presentation, students often co", "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pUPQRG0T5Y", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCEBb1b_L6zDS3xTUrIALZOw", "source_obj__id": 437, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/2pUPQRG0T5Y/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "The Power of Experience with Dr. Ari Epstein", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
