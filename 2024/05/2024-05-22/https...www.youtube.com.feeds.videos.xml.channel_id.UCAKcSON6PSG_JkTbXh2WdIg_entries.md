Leeds band Yard Act shored up their emerging sound during an unlikely time; specifically, in the midst of the global pandemic. “I have a lot of respect and space for people that didn't catch that creative break that we did,” Yard Act frontman James Smith reflects, “but we did, and we made the most of it.” 

Watch and listen to one of their latest singles "Land of the Blind."

Singer-songwriter Rachael Kilgour performs "Heart On Fire" in studio
Support The Current: https://support.mpr.org/youtube  

Grief is one of those things where there’s really no one way to express it, and those expressions vary greatly from person to person. After losing her father Robert in 2017, singer-songwriter Rachael Kilgour was processing the loss and wrote a song about her late father. She then decided to write an entire album of songs as she reflected more deeply on his life. The result is "My Father Loved Me," a collection of nine songs released in September 2023.

Rachael Kilgour visited The Current studio for a session hosted by Radio Heartland’s Mike Pengra to play three songs from the album. Watch and listen to "Heart On Fire" above.
