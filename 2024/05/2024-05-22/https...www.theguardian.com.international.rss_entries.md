Is that a record for a cup competition?”</strong> wonders Kári Tulinius.</p><p>Wolfsburg’s women’s team have dominated the German Cup to a staggering degree. They won it this year without conceding a goal, winning 2-0, 5-0, 3-0, 9-0 and finally 2-0 against Bayern Munich in the final earlier this month. Last season, they conceded only three goals en route to glory, but compensated by scoring 27 in five games. In fact it’s four years since they failed to win a DFB-Pokal game by at least two goals; they won the 2020 final on penalties after a thrilling 3-3 draw with SGS Essen.</p><p><strong>10</strong> <strong>Germany</strong> (<strong>VfL Wolfsburg</strong>, 2015-24)</p><p><strong>6</strong> <strong>France</strong> (<strong>Lyon Féminin</strong>, 2012-17)</p><p><strong>4</strong> <strong>England</strong> (<strong>Arsenal Wo

## Pandemonium review – wintry gloom as ghost of dead driver meets the biker he killed

<p>Director Quarxx’s underworld car-crash drama chances little humour as it dolorously teases out morals and metaphysics</p><p>This Stygian jolly, in which dumbstruck driver Nathan (Hugo Dillon) finds himself out of the mortal coil after colliding with a motorcycle, has some of the heavy-metal-album-cover energy of Bill and Ted gawping at hell’s gnarly sights. But French director and multimedia artist Quarxx’s metaphysical vista is so unredeemably bleak that you find yourself wishing for San Dimas’s finest’s “You’re dead, dude!” amazement, or at least the odd air-guitar riff.</p><p>Pandemonium squeezes out a little angry and disoriented humour at its start as Nathan, confronted with his shattered corpse, finds himself squabbling on a mountain road with Daniel (Arben Bajraktaraj), the motorcyclist he killed instantly. But when two disembodied gateways – a celestial blue forcefield and gigantic red double-doors – appear next to them, it is only the self-righteous Daniel who hears singin

<p>Alongside rare birds, reptiles and insects, this corner of Dorset, poignantly depicted in Mike Leigh’s Nuts in May, serves up brilliant heathland walks, sea views and pints of local ale</p><p>Mike Leigh’s brilliant 1976 Dorset-based comedy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuts_in_May_(Play_for_Today)">Nuts in May</a> begins with Keith and Candice-Marie taking the chain ferry from Sandbanks across the mouth of Poole harbour to the Isle of Purbeck, where they camp, visit Corfe Castle, walk along the mighty Jurassic coastline and end up in an altercation with a young Brummie couple called Finger and Honky. For me, watching Nuts in May is an annual tradition, as is visiting the peninsula where it was filmed. Most of us have places for which we feel a particularly strong pull; one of mine is Purbeck.

## A moment that changed me: Should I laugh or cry? When I scattered my grandmother’s ashes, I did both

<p>She hadn’t lived in India for 50 years, but her last request was to be returned to the place of her birth. On the banks of the Ganges there were tears – but also all the chaos, hustle and humour of life</p><p>In October 2019, I was in India, standing by the dusty banks of the Ganges on a quest to spread my grandmother’s ashes. She hadn’t lived in the country for the last 50 years and hadn’t even set foot in it for a decade at least. My parents had never lived there and neither had my brother and I. This wasn’t a homecoming. It was a chore borne from her final request: to perform her last rites in the place she had barely clung on to. It was a strange holiday.</p><p>At 25, I had already experienced my fair share of goodbyes. The deceased were second cousins, granduncles, grandparents, even school classmates, and the ritual was always the same. We would visit their home to see the coffin and hear the wails of the surrounding mourners before heading to the local crematorium in Hounslo

## The villages near Kharkiv were recovering. Fleeing again, their people feel betrayed by the west – and I understand why | Ada Wordsworth

<p>After 20 months of relative peace, the homes and lives my charity has been helping rebuild are on the frontline once more</p><p>The Russian offensive on the Kharkiv region this month has, after 20 months of relative peace, again placed many of the villages where my charity works, repairing homes destroyed by bombs, at the forefront of the war.</p><p>I began volunteering in Kharkiv two years ago, having dropped out of my master’s degree in Russian literature and set up the charity to support Ukrainians. After the region’s liberation in September 2022, hundreds of thousands of people had started to return to Kharkiv city and the wider region from other parts of Ukraine, and countries that had taken them in as refugees. The villages where I work were reawakening, the craters that lined the streets had been filled, shops were reopening, electricity was back on. People’s return was mostly driven by a desire to be at home.</p><p>Ada Wordsworth is the co-founder of KHARPP, a grassroots pr
