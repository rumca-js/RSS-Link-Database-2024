<p>With the updates to Power Platform unveiled at this week’s Build event, Microsoft is not focusing on improving coding capabilities directly, but trying to simplify the overly-complex enterprise environments where programmers have to exist.</p><p>The 2024 reality for enterprise coders is that—depending on the analyst firm citing the figures—somewhere between 70% and 80% of their daily tasks do not involve coding and instead involve navigating the bureaucracy of the global IT environment. It’s actually the intersection of multiple complex environments, from the global enterprise to interconnected cloud environments from multiple companies, typically including Microsoft, Google and Amazon. </p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3715351/microsoft-s-power-platform-updates-hint-at-the-future-of-enterprise-coding.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>

<p>Progressive web apps are an innovation of modern web development, pairing the ubiquity of web browsers with the richness of native applications. Specialized features such as service workers increase the complexity of development as compared to a typical web UI, but they provide an enormous benefit in exchange: cross-device, native-like features delivered inside a web browser.</p><h2 class="toc">Features of progressive web apps</h2>
<p>If you consider the difference between a typical web browser application and an app installed on a laptop or mobile phone, you get a sense of the gap that progressive web apps bridge. A defining feature of installed apps is that they run on the device when there is no network connection. Progressive web apps support similar offline functionality within the browser.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3715423/a-first-look-at-progressive-web-apps.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></se

Whether it’s a client-side app, an app with a web front end, or an edge-device app, chances are a business application needs a database. In many cases, an <em>embedded</em> database will do. Embedded databases are lightweight, compact, and portable—and for some applications, they are a better choice than a traditional server.</p><p><a href="https://sqlite.org/" rel="nofollow">SQLite</a> is an embeddable open source database, written in C and queryable with conventional <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3219795/what-is-sql-the-lingua-franca-of-data-analysis.html">SQL</a>.
