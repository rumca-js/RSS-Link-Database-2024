<p>Microsoft said Wednesday that it is transforming Copilot into an app on Windows, and migrating the icon back to literally front and center on your PC.</p>



<p>Microsoft made reference to the change in its keynote addresses at Build, its developer conference in Seattle. But a blog post on Wednesday outlined Microsoft&rsquo;s motivations for doing so, and what it plans to do with the Copilot Windows app.</p>

<p>Microsoft has released version 125 of the Microsoft Edge browser and it&rsquo;s an intriguing one with more news than usual.</p>



<p>One of the most interesting additions is a new slider that lets you decide how much working memory Edge is allowed to use, which could be a key reason that pushes you to consider <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394959/why-switch-google-chrome-microsoft-edge.html">switching from Chrome to Edge</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to upgrade your bland PC gaming setup, the <strong>Corsair MM700 RGB Gaming Mouse Pad</strong> is a solid way to do it, especially since it&rsquo;s currently cheaper than ever. <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/Corsair-MM700-Extended-Cloth-Gaming/dp/B08QSNNV5H&amp;xcust=2-1-2340890-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Available for just $45</a>&mdash;down from its original $60&mdash;now&rsquo;s the perfect time to add this one to your cart.</p>

<p>The mouse pad itself is pretty big, <strong>mea

<p>It&rsquo;s not hard to find a monitor for a hundred bucks &mdash; go to Best Buy or Walmart and you can probably get one today. Finding a <em>decent </em>monitor for that price, well that&rsquo;s another matter. Today Dell has one that fits the bill, a 23.8-inch screen with a quality IPS panel. It&rsquo;s selling for <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-24-monitor-s2425h/apd/210-bmgx/monitors-monitor-accessories&amp;xcust=2-1-2341498-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">just $99.99 on Dell&rsquo;s official online store</a>, a $20 savings off the regular price. </p>



<p>At just $100 you don&rsquo;t get a lot of side dishes with this entree. The S2425H monitor doesn&rsquo;t have many extra features, no USB ports and only one video connection, HDMI. But it&rsquo;s got the goods

<p>USB Type-C is the most flexible connection for notebooks and smartphones. The most important of its many capabilities is as a charging socket for battery-powered devices &mdash; this should finally make everything simple: One socket, one cable, one power supply for all devices &ndash; from computers to smartphones and tablets to headphones and other peripherals.</p>



<p>So much for the theory, which always sounds simple with USB. The practice is more confusing.</p>



<p>Not every USB-C power supply is suitable for every device, not all Type-C ports can be used to charge devices quickly or at all, and not every Type-C cable ensures reliable power transmission. </p>



<p>Our guide gives you an overview of the technical possibilities of Type-C charging and recommends suitable power supply units for all devices.</p>
