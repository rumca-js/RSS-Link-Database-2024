Du Wen, a former government official, demanded silver coins from Xi Jinping, and won!

Du Wen speaks to Xi Jinping in a video: Mr. Xi Jinping, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, my name is Du Wen, former director of the Legal Advisory Office of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Government. We have been forced into exile in Europe due to unbearable persecution by the CCP authorities. With great sorrow, we release this video, hoping that Almighty Jesus will help you see it. You are aware of Du Wen's case, as the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection has reported it to you. If you cannot remember, please find the book about Du Wen's case on your bookshelf.
