<p>Zoom is adding “post-quantum” end-to-end encryption to its video and voice meeting software. The aim is to protect communication data sent between its apps once quantum computers are sufficiently power to compromise existing encryption methods. </p>



<p>Right now, it’s difficult for current or “classical” computers to break the modern encryption algorithms that protect internet communications — that means anything from text messages to online banking or shopping. But security experts are concerned cybercriminals can collect encrypted data now and decrypt it once quantum computers become sufficiently capable, a strategy referred to as “harvest now, decrypt later.”</p>

<p>Apple has been tardy in developing and announcing its plans for using generative AI (genAI), but so what? Apple has been late before in jumping on important tech trends and it has caught up. The arrival of genAI tools and platforms over the past 18 months has been the biggest shift in tech since the advent of cloud computing, and Apple’s Siri is a pathetic example of a virtual assistant in desperate need of a new brain.</p>



<p>Those two realities have led to a lot of criticism by analysts and the media in recent months about Apple’s non-existent AI strategy, and the company’s need to scramble to catch up. (And that was before this week’s <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2116724/

<p>Allow me to paint a purely hypothetical picture for you — for, erm, no reason in particular.</p>



<p>Imagine the following conversation about a groundbreaking new product someone is <em>really</em> excited to show you. I’ll take the liberty of playing the role of you and responding as we go:</p>

<p><em>“Hey, look, this new magic instant dictionary is super convenient and easy to use!”</em></p>

<p>Oh, nice — so it gives you correct definitions and everything?</p>

<p><em>“Well, some of the time.”</em></p>

<p>“Why should I buy a new PC?” </p>



<p>Microsoft this week finally had an answer to that question with its new <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2024/05/20/introducing-copilot-pcs/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Copilot+ PCs</a>. These computers boast a suite of new AI-based features that promise to transform how you work on your PC — while also delivering serious battery life and performance boosts.</p>



<p>Readers of my <a href="https://theintelligence.com/windows-cw" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Windows Intelligence newsletter</a> have often asked me why they should get a new PC. And that’s a totally valid question: Windows 11 on modern hardware is nice and
