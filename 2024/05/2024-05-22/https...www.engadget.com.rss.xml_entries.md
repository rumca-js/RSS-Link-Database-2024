<p>OpenAI and News Corp, the owner of <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>, <em>MarketWatch</em>, <em>The Sun</em>, and more than a dozen other publishing brands, have struck a multi-year deal to display news from these publications in ChatGPT, News Corp <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://newscorp.com/2024/05/22/news-corp-and-openai-sign-landmark-multi-year-global-partnership/">announced</a> on Wednesday. OpenAI will be able to access both current and well as archived content from News Corp’s publications and use the data to further train its AI models. Neither company disclosed the terms of the deal, but a report in <em>The Wall Street Journal </em><a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.wsj.com/business/media/openai-news-corp-strike-deal-23f186ba">estimated</a> that News Corp would get $250 million over five years in cash and credits.</p>

<p>Bluesky, the open source social media service that began as an internal Twitter project, has gained a key feature as it looks to compete with X and Threads. The service has finally added <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bluesky-plans-to-launch-dms-for-users-105039310.html"><ins>direct messaging</ins></a> capabilities more than a year after it started onboarding new users.</p>
<p>Direct messages are now available on both Bluesky’s app and website, the company announced in a <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/05-22-2024-direct-messages"><ins>blog post</ins></a>. The default setting allows users to receive messages from people they follow, though settings can be adjusted to receive messages from “everyone” or “no one.” For now, it sounds like DMs on Bluesky are fairly basic and only support person-to-person text chats, but the company says it plans to add support for media and group messaging, as well as end-to-end encryption “down the line.”</p>

<p>Back when we were all stuck at home in 2020 and had to stay on video calls all day, some companies tried to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/zoom-filters-reactions-background-noise-suppression-124529590.html"><ins>liven things up</ins></a> with augmented reality filters and background replacements. Maybe they caused someone, somewhere to smile once or twice. Although it's hard to argue that they lifted most people out of the doom and gloom of the pandemic, the filters by and large stuck around.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's not entirely true in Snap's case. The company used to have <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-26-snap-camera-desktop-snapchat-ar-filters.html"><ins>a desktop camera app</ins></a> that included AR folders, but it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/05/snap-is-shutting-down-its-desktop-camera-app-that-allows-users-to-apply-filters-during-video-calls/"><ins>killed that last year</ins></a>.

<p><em>This story contains discussions of sexual violence.</em></p>
<p>Multiple scenes from <em>INDIKA </em>are seared into my brain. A palm-sized person crawls out of a nun’s mouth and runs down her arm, frenzied, in the middle of a Catholic ritual. A man is suspended in the air, his torso impaled on a strip of curling rebar, while a guitarist gently encourages him to die. Dozens of bus-sized fish dangle on rotating spits above a blazing silo. The mangled head of a feral dog flops repeatedly against the gears of a mill, neck limp and tongue lolling. The sudden glimpse of a demon: gray skin, too many arms and joints bent the wrong way, bug-like and hulking. When I move, it moves.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Back at home in front of my PC, my skin prickles with goosebumps. <em>INDIKA </em>generates visceral reactions effortlessly and always with a tinge of surprise. It’s a (mostly) third-person narrative adventure set in an alternative 19th century Russia, and it stars

Rarely has that been more clear than a case out of Emory University in which the school went from awarding students with an entrepreneurship prize worth $10,000 for their AI-powered studying tool to suspending them for it, <a href="https://www.404media.co/email/cc1d5860-9db9-4ffe-a77b-21b5e65adef9/"><em>404 Media</em></a><a href="https://www.404media.co/email/cc1d5860-9db9-4ffe-a77b-21b5e65adef9/"> reports</a>.
