								<p>No, really, upcoming board game Werewolf in the Dark is billed as hide and seek meets Werewolf, but we can&rsquo;t unsee the similarities to Among Us, the lockdown social deduction obsession now mainly seen on kids T-shirts.

The <strong>Lego BrickHeadz Sonic the Hedgehog (40627)</strong> is the 213th figure in the main BrickHeadz line-up. But the ‘Blur Blur’ isn’t the only Sonic character to receive the blocky caricature treatment, with Miles ‘Tails’ Prower and a Knuckles &amp; Shadow double pack, completing the 16-bit-themed line-up.</p>
