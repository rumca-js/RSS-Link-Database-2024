Animals and fungi predominantly use two different modes of cell division -- called open and closed mitosis, respectively. A new study has shown that different species of Ichthyosporea -- marine protists that are close relatives of both animals and fungi -- use either open and closed mitosis, closely correlated to whether the species has multinucleate life cycle stages. The study demonstrates the way animals do cell division might have evolved long before animals themselves did and how this is linked to an organism's life cycle.

Researchers have developed an approach to 'deleting' a blood system affected by leukemia while simultaneously building up a new, healthy system with donor blood stem cells. The team reports on the promising results obtained in animal experiments and with human cells in the laboratory.

## Cement recycling method could help solve one of the world's biggest climate challenges

Researchers have developed a method to produce very low emission concrete at scale -- an innovation that could be transformative in the transition to net zero. The method, which the researchers say is 'an absolute miracle', uses the electrically-powered arc furnaces used for steel recycling to simultaneously recycle cement, the carbon-hungry component of concrete.

## Using wobbling stellar material, astronomers measure the spin of a supermassive black hole for the first time

Scientists have uncovered the properties of a rare earth element that was first discovered 80 years ago at the very same laboratory, opening a new pathway for the exploration of elements critical in modern technology, from medicine to space travel.

## Under extreme impacts, metals get stronger when heated, study finds

Scientists have discovered that when metal is struck by an object moving at a super high velocity, the heat makes the metal stronger. The finding could lead to new approaches to designing materials for extreme environments, such as shields that protect spacecraft or equipment for high-speed manufacturing.
