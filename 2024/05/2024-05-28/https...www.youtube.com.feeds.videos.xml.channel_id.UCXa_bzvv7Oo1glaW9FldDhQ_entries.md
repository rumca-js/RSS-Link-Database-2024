Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown has been radio silent for a couple months now despite a projected 2024 release. This is the longest time fans have had to wait for a newsletter and associated trailer since the big gameplay showcase last summer promised monthly updates. 

It’s fair to assume that the developer will announce something major in July like they did last year. Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown's February newsletter highlighted how they’re done with the main bulk of development for the game, only working on optimization and server stability now. 

KT is likely waiting for what Microsoft will reveal for Forza Horizon before making a committed release date. What’s most exciting is the recent retailer price listings for Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown at the lean price of $59.99. Because of these factors, we’d be surprised if Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown isn’t released before the Winter quarter of 2024.

Another year, another Formula One title from Codemasters, not that this is a bad thing since the development team knocked it out of the park with last year's game. F1 24 offers largely the same experience as last year but also purports many changes to its handling. 

Said changes have been...interesting. While fitting well with the controller, it feels sharper and more arcade-like. While custom setups alleviate this to some extent, it's something to remember over last year's title. 

There are some positives from the new Driver Career with engineer objectives, secret meetings and Accolades to the Challenge Career. F1 World, such as it is, also returns. F1 24 has several positives and may satisfy fans, especially with the new Career modes. However, if you're skeptical about the handling, you might want to wait for Codemasters to iron things out.

After the disastrous failure of the Wii U, Nintendo made a comeback with the release of Nintendo Switch. The hybrid console wowed gamers with its flexibility and different play modes. In addition to that, Switch’s popularity has resulted in a resurgence of third-party support with most major publishers choosing to release games on it.

These range from poorly ported multiplatform titles to barely functioning indie releases. In this video we will be discussing 15 of the worst Nintendo Switch games of all time.
