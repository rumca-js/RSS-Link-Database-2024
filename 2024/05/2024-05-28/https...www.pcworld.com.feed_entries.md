<p>I started playing <em>World of Warcraft</em> back when the <em>Burning Crusade</em> expansion first dropped. Years later, I dove into the <em><strong>Small World of Warcraft</strong></em> board game to get a similar fix.</p>



<p>Unfortunately for me, I paid full price. You, however, can get <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/Days-Wonder-Small-World-Warcraft/dp/B08BJBQLNR/&amp;xcust=2-1-2348378-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Small World of Warcraft for a mere $42 right now</a>.</p>



<p>While the <em>Small World</em> series of board games is nothing new, this take on the world of Azeroth is simply delightful. Set in the Warcraft universe, you&rsquo;ll adventure with your favorite races across legendary terrains to conquer territories and control artifacts.</p>

<p>CAMM2 is <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2326887/meet-lpcamm2-the-fast-and-efficient-new-laptop-ram-of-the-future.html">a new standard for laptop memory</a>. It&rsquo;s tiny, incredibly skinny, and compatible with modern DDR5 memory. That makes it a suitable replacement for space-hogging SO-DIMMs or soldered memory modules, which can&rsquo;t be replaced by the end user. But what about using it on a desktop? MSI and Kingston are keen to try. </p>



<p>The two companies have revealed a concept desktop motherboard that uses the CAMM2 memory standard, installed via screws instead of the familiar DIMM modules you&rsquo;ll see on basically every full-sized mobo. It&rsquo;s based on a Z790 Intel motherboard that uses the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2216340/maingears-zero-drop-rear-cable-desktops-now-available.html">Project Zero system</a> for rear

## Best USB-C cables 2024: Get quality charging and data transfers

<p>It&rsquo;s easy to think that all USB-C cables are the same, and that manufacturers are only claiming to be superior in order to jack up the price. After all, it&rsquo;s <em>just a cable</em>, right?</p>



<p>That&rsquo;s completely understandable, but not always accurate. We at PCWorld have tested a ton of USB-C cables and can say with certainty not all of them are made the same. In fact, there can be huge performance differences among cables when it comes to both charging and transferring data.</p>



<p>Hands-on evaluation of numerous cables ranging from the biggest, most-recognizable brand-names to the cheapest of the cheap has revealed some clear winners, which I highlight below.</p>



<p><strong>Why you should trust me: </strong>PCWorld has been testing hardware since the 1980s and I&rsquo;ve been poking and prodding PC components since I cracked open my

<p>We&rsquo;ve all got to die sometime. But whatever you think awaits us after death, it&rsquo;s unlikely to involve a suped-up gaming PC, a fiber connection, and tons of digital video games.</p>



<p>Last week, a Steam support representative said that in addition to not being able to transfer your account to another person, you also can&rsquo;t leave it to your beneficiaries.</p>



<p>But this policy against the inheriting of PC games might be in violation of a relatively recent United States law.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for a gaming monitor upgrade for your desktop or laptop, and you need it at the absolute cheapest price possible, then today&rsquo;s a good day. Acer is selling a 34-inch ultrawide monitor with a 165hz refresh rate for just $200, and eBay will throw in an extra 9 percent off. That <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.ebay.com/itm/266377867299&amp;xcust=2-1-2348062-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">brings the final price down to just $181.99.</a></p>



<p>How is this price so low? There is one proviso: it&rsquo;s a refurbished unit. But we think it&rsquo;s still a deal worth considering, for two reasons. One, even though this is listed on eBay it&rsquo;s a sale coming right from Acer&rsquo;s official &ldquo;recertified store.&rdquo; And two, it comes with a two-year warranty

<p>When Windows 11 arrived on the market in October 2021, it was supposed to revolutionize the popular operating system. Unfortunately for Microsoft, many users still prefer Windows 10 as the better option for their everyday PCs and refuse to switch.</p>



<p>Indeed, the numbers for Windows 11 are continuing to decline and Windows 10 continues to dominate.</p>

From that point on, posts and photos from all users will be read by the AI to help train them and improve services such as the AI Creative Tool. Meta is currently providing information about this on Facebook.</p>



<p>Private messages will not be affected, only public texts and images. Nevertheless, many users may be sceptical about this new regulation due to data protection concerns or for personal reasons. </p>
