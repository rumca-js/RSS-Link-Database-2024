This is the longest time fans have had to wait for a newsletter and associated trailer since the big gameplay showcase last summer promised monthly updates. \n\nIt\u2019s fair to assume that the developer will announce something major in July like they did last year. Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown's February newsletter highlighted how they\u2019re done with the main bulk of development for the game, only working on optimization and server stability now. \n\nKT is likely waiting for what Microsoft will reveal for Forza Horizon before making a committed release date. What\u2019s most exciting is the recent retailer price listings for Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown at the lean price of $59.99. Because of these factors, we\u2019d be surprised if Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown isn\u2019t released before the Winter quarter of 2024.", "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exJG8nuCFOY", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "source_obj__id": 129, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/exJG8nuCFOY/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown - What The Hell Is Going On?", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-05-28T15:00:07+00:00", "description": "Another year, another Formula One title from Codemasters, not that this is a bad thing since the development team knocked it out of the park with last year's game. F1 24 offers largely the same experience as last year but also purports many changes to its handling. \n\nSaid changes have been...interesting. While fitting well with the controller, it feels sharper and more arcade-like. While custom setups alleviate this to some extent, it's something to remember over last year's title. \n\nThere are some positives from the new Driver Career with engineer objectives, secret meetings and Accolades to the Challenge Career. F1 World, such as it is, also returns. F1 24 has several positives and may satisfy fans, especially with the new Career modes. However, if you're skeptical about the handling, you might want to wait for Codemasters to iron things out.", "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UQUAsOhCKk", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "source_obj__id": 129, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/3UQUAsOhCKk/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "F1 24 Review - The Final Verdict", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-05-28T09:30:11+00:00", "description": "After the disastrous failure of the Wii U, Nintendo made a comeback with the release of Nintendo Switch.

In addition to that, Switch\u2019s popularity has resulted in a resurgence of third-party support with most major publishers choosing to release games on it. \n\nHowever, not all games are made equal, and the Switch has been home to a fair share of disappointing releases that are best left unplayed.
