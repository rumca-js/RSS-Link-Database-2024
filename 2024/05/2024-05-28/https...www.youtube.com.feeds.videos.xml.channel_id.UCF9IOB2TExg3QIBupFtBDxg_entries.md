NHS staff told to apologise for using ‘wrong’ pronouns

Lewisham and Greenwich NHS Trust issued an 18-page diversity and inclusion policy forcing medics to accept patients’ personal pronouns.

Should not confront patients using single-sex facilities regardless of their appearance.

The trust’s trans policy, which came into effect in February last year according to the Daily Mail, said staff must say sorry to patients if they made mistakes relating to a patient’s pronouns.

It also ordered them to make a “commitment to try harder” if they made mistakes about patients’ preferred pronouns.

Victoria Atkins, Health Secretary

“I am crystal clear: biological sex matters, and the language used by the NHS needs to recognise the different biological needs of men and women,” 

“Illnesses and conditions that we know impact men and women differently should be communicated in a clear and accurate way.
