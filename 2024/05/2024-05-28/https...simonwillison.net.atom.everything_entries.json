I gave an invited keynote on the Saturday morning titled \"Imitation intelligence\", tying together much of what I've learned about Large Language Models over the past couple of years and making the case that the Python community has a unique opportunity and responsibility to help try to nudge this technology in a positive direction.</p>\n<p>The video isn't out yet but I'll publish detailed notes to accompany my talk (using my <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/annotatedtalks/\">annotated presentation format</a>) as soon as it goes live on YouTube.</p>\n<p>PyCon was a really great conference. Pittsburgh is a fantastic city, and I'm delighted that PyCon will be in the same venue next year so I can really take advantage of the opportunity to explore in more detail.</p>\n<p>I also realized that it's about time Datasette participated in the PyCon sprints - the project is mat", "language": "en-us", "link": "https://simonwillison.net/2024/May/28/weeknotes/#atom-everything", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://simonwillison.net/atom/everything", "source_obj__id": 423, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Weeknotes: PyCon US 2024", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-05-28T19:47:13+00:00", "description": "<p><a href=\"https://github.com/karpathy/llm.c/discussions/481\">Reproducing GPT-2 (124M) in llm.c in 90 minutes for $20</a></p>\nGPT-2 124M was the smallest model in the GPT-2 series released by OpenAI back in 2019. Andrej Karpathy's llm.c is an evolving  4,000 line C/CUDA implementation which can now train a GPT-2 model from scratch in 90 minutes against a 8X A100 80GB GPU server. This post walks through exactly how to run the training, using 10 billion tokens of FineWeb.</p>\n<p>Andrej notes that this isn't actually that far off being able to train a GPT-3:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Keep in mind that here we trained for 10B tokens, while GPT-3 models were all trained for 300B tokens.
