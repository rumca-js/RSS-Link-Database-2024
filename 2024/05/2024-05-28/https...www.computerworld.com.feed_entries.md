<p>The tech world lost a legend earlier this month — and it happened the same week that his life-long vision was finally realized. </p>



<p>I’m talking about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Bell" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">C. Gordon Bell</a>, the computer scientist who helped usher in the age of the personal computer. He <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/1581927/q-a-it-vet-gordon-bell-talks-about-the-most-influential-computers.html">designed the first microcomputer in 1965</a> — the DEC PDP-8 — among countless other achievements in the field of computing. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/21/technology/c-gordon-bell-dead.html" rel="noreferrer noope

<p>Americans, it seems, are of several minds about the hottest of hot topics this year: artificial intelligence. They’re torn between curiosity about the benefits to society and concern about its effects on their lives.</p>



<p>A new study from global consultancy Public First found that, while the most common emotion cited was curiosity (39%), an almost equal number (37%) said they were worried about AI. Last year, 42% cited curiosity and 32% were worried, according to the study, which was based on four nationally representative polls of adults across the US and the UK, and conducted in partnership with the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation’s Center for Data Innovation.</p>
