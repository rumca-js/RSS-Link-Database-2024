---------------------------------------------------------------
What is a password manager?

First things first, think of a password manager like a virtual vault. It keeps your passwords and data stored safely, and just like a vault, it needs a key to unlock it. This key is in the form of a master password, which is generally the only password you’d need to access your online accounts. 

How to create a strong master password:
🎯 No personal information
🎯 At least 12 characters
🎯 Use upper and lowercase letters
