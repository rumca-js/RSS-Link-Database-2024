								<p>What if the Rocket League cars could blast seven shades of engine oil out of one another?

								<p>If there&rsquo;s one thing Modern Horizons 3 is absolutely stuffed with, well it&rsquo;s Commander cards.

								<p>Baldurs Gate 3 may be the best CRPG ever made, but 2020&rsquo;s Solasta: Crown of the Magister is actually an even more accurate adaptation of the DnD 5e rules into a digital game engine.
