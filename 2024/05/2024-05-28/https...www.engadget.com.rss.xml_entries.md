<p>The Apple Vision Pro was marketed <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-vision-pro-two-months-later-a-telepresence-dream-181550906.html">primarily as a productivity machine</a>, but as any active VR user can tell you, it’s the games that sell these devices. Apple’s headset offers access to hundreds of games, but mostly as quick and dirty iPad ports that show up as a virtual screen in your field of vision. This, however, is starting to change.</p>
<p>Developer Owlchemy Labs just announced that two of its marquee titles, <em>Job Simulator</em> and <em>Vacation Simulator</em>, <a href="https://twitter.com/OwlchemyLabs/status/1795440098089312603">are now available for the Apple Vision Pro</a>. These aren’t iPad ports. Both games are fully immersive VR experiences that have been optimized for Apple’s headset. This means that controls have been mapped to hand-and-eye tracking. The AVP’s lack of a dedicated controller would absolutely hamper some pre-existing VR games, but these two sho

<p>TikTok will face off with the Justice Department this fall in its bid to stop a law that could lead to a ban of the app in the United States. The US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia set a September date for oral arguments in two cases challenging <a href="https://www.engadget.com/joe-biden-signs-the-bill-that-could-ban-tiktok-in-the-united-states-154106950.html"><ins>a law</ins></a> that requires ByteDance to sell the app or face a ban.</p>
<p>TikTok filed a lawsuit claiming that the law was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-is-suing-the-us-government-to-stop-its-app-being-banned-163132752.html"><ins>unconstitutional</ins></a> earlier this month. The company has said that divesting from ByteDance is “simply not possible” and that it had already negotiated with the US government to address national security concerns.

<p>Japan‚Äôs hit virtual pet, Punirunes, will be released in the US this summer and I can almost guarantee most of you have never seen a toy quite like this before. A play on the Japanese mimetic word for ‚Äúsquishy‚Äù (<em>punipuni</em>), Punirunes has a design quirk that sets it apart from other gadgets of its ilk: a doughy button at the center of the device that serves to simulate physical contact with your pet. How do you get to that button? By sticking your finger into the quarter-sized hole in the side of the plastic shell.</p>
<p>It is undeniably a little weird. The device will even display an animation of your finger on the screen when you do this (you can choose from a variety of skin colors during setup). But once you get past the strangeness of the aforementioned act and really get into the things it allows you to do, Punirunes‚Äô oddest feature actually makes for a pretty rich virtual pet experience. The squishy button feels like a joystick wrapped in mochi, which makes se
