After a career of dominance at Roland Garros, where he has so often been untouchable even against some of the greatest ever players, he would have been forgiven for feeling a sense of injustice and frustration with a straight-sets loss in the first round to Alexander Zverev. Instead, he felt progress: “I was not that far,” he said. “That’s my feeling.”</p><p>Nadal’s demeanour further underlined what has been increasingly clear over the last few weeks. If this really is the end and retirement is imminent, it will be because his body made the decision, not his mind.

And because understanding its rhythms and tactics is so easily done, those who know nothing about it whatsoever can still master it almost immediately, processing its 150 or so years of history to deliver infallible analysis in a matter of minutes. Take Todd Boehly, for example. One might have thought someone with no footballing experience would require time to adjust to a new sport and culture; not so! Rather, Boehly’s floppy fringe and trove of blazers have sent him soaring like a Rüpell’s vulture learning to fly, surveying everything from above before swooping low to pull flesh off the bones of ground-bound inferiors.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/footb

<p>From jobbing workers to familiar names, legions of entertainers are working well into their 70s and 80s. Why? Our writer uncovers an alarming story of shrinking budgets, axed royalties, misguided mortgages and paltry pensions </p><p>‘The budgets were fantastic,” says Alexei Sayle, remembering making shows with the BBC in the 1980s and 90s. “We’d always go over budget and they’d just say, ‘Oh well.’ Since then, there’s been a rerouting of funds away from the talent. It doesn’t affect the superstars but it certainly affects the foot soldiers. It’s a lot harder to make a living now.”</p><p>At the age of 71, the comedian, writer and actor is still working. He feels “the drive” to create and perform, rather than financial pressure, but does notice major changes. “If you made your money in the 70s and 80s, you’ve got a better chance of being well off,” he says. Terms then were “much fairer”, with artists benefiting from residuals rather than just one-off payments.</p> <a href="https://ww

<p>Joe Bloom put an old-fashioned red phone on a bridge and invited random strangers to share their views with the world. The result is an Instagram sensation – even if young people can’t work a landline</p><p>Joe Bloom has always admired the art of the phone conversation. “You see it in movies: it’s always this nostalgic and almost glamorous thing, holding a phone up to your ear and talking into this object,” he says. (Ironically, we’re talking over Zoom.) But many of us have cut phone calls out of our lives, losing touch with their otherworldly magic. While we’re perfectly content staring at screens and scrolling through endless content, speaking into the ether has become unnervingly unnatural. And even when we do take a call, it’s usually through earphones on the move rather than by actually sitting down and putting a phone to our ear. <br /><br />
 For Bloom, this telephobia is part of a wider trend relating to our increasingly poor connections with each other. “There are a lot of

<p>Half of all new cars are now SUVs, making them a major cause of the intensifying climate crisis, say experts</p><p>Sales of SUVs hit a new record in 2023, making up half of all new cars sold globally, new data has revealed. Experts warned that the rising sales of the large, heavy vehicles is pushing up the carbon emissions that drive global heating.</p><p>The analysis, by the International Energy Agency, found that the rising emissions from SUVs in 2023 made up 20% of the global rise in CO2, making the vehicles a major cause of the intensifying climate crisis.

Imagine reaching the age of 49 before worrying about how many clothes you’re allowed to take off.

<p>Obsessively detailed clash between two rival high school teams has done massive box office in Japan, but it won’t make much sense to the uninitiated</p><p>This is the second highest-grossing movie of the year in Japan, but unless you’re a teenager, an anime junkie or really, really care about volleyball, you’re unlikely to get much out of it. Storywise, it feels a little like walking into a play halfway through – which in effect you are, unless you’ve followed Haruichi Furudate’s huge-selling, long-running manga, from which this is adapted, and the 85 episodes of TV anime it’s already spawned. Even the title will be indecipherable to newcomers: “<em>haikyuu”</em> is Japanese for volleyball; the “dumpster battle” refers to our two rival high school teams and their urban-wildlife mascots, a crow and a cat.</p><p>With very little preamble we’re thrown straight into a high-stakes match between these teams – a third-round playoff in Spring National tournament – and that’s where we stay

<p>The BBC’s comedy chief thinks the format needs ‘saving’. But it’s the stereotypes that are dead: the<strong> </strong>sitcom itself is thriving</p><p>Just as we could most do with a laugh in the painful run-up to the election, last week the BBC’s director of comedy commissioning, Jon Petrie, told a festival audience that the mainstream UK comedy scene needs “a couple of Berocca and a black americano”. At the BBC Comedy festival in Glasgow, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/speeches/2024/jon-petrie-bbc-comedy-festival">he appealed</a> for programme-makers to “save” sitcoms.

Or – even worse – “comedy drama”?</p><p>But how on earth can sitcom be dead when we live in an age of constant new content, endless streaming and easily accessible reruns of old and new material? And what does it matter what we call comedy, as long as we are getting

<p>New Netflix docuseries Dancing for the Devil details strange story of young dancers enrolled in a mysterious religious organisation with allegations of abuse</p><p>Since they were young girls, Miranda and Melanie Wilking danced together. The sisters, two years apart, grew up exceptionally close in suburban Detroit, dancing in their basement, in competitions and eventually in pursuit of a professional career. When Miranda graduated high school and moved to Los Angeles to chase the dream, Melanie followed as soon as she could. The duo, who looked nearly identical – long brown hair, bright blue eyes, sharp features, deep tans and lithe physiques – found modest work auditioning together, but greater success online. By this point, in the late 2010s, TikTok was on the rise; short, peppy dance videos to a front-facing camera were the fastest avenue to a following, and thus a living, via sponsorships. Miranda and Melanie started an account together as the <a href="https://www.instagram.com

<p>From the love/hate setup and the must-dump boyfriend to the kooky mate and frantic finale this well-crafted love story hits all the classic romcom beats, just don’t expect fireworks</p><p>Based on Sophie Cousens’ novel of the same name, and adapted for the screen by the author, this opens with a twinkly tourism-office-style visit-London-for-the-festive-season montage that lets us know from the off that the film will be playing by 1990s romcom rules. You know the sort of thing: a declaration of love delivered against a pressing deadline ideally involving a change of location. As This Time Next year progresses, it quickly becomes apparent that said rules have been thoroughly studied, to mostly satisfying effect, as from the get-go the story hits the expected beats. You’ve got heroine Minnie’s initial antagonism towards her love-match Quinn, a loser boyfriend who must first be seen through and ditched, and of course heartwarming subplots involving careers and family.

<p>Tension at a writers’ co-op is spliced with the hunt for a gifted footballer in the Netherland author’s first book in 10 years, an exceptional tale of desire and betrayal</p><p>Joseph O’Neill broke out with his third novel, <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jun/01/fiction1">Netherland</a></em>, which made the Booker longlist in 2008 and was ecstatically reviewed in the <em>New Yorker</em> by James Wood, whose praise made it that summer’s hot book, propelling him into the literary A-list. But come autumn, O’Neill was the fall guy in Zadie Smith’s influential essay Two Paths for the Novel, which contrasted the smoothness of his post-9/11 scenario (“perfectly done … that’s the problem”) with the edgier experiment of Tom McCarthy’s <em>Remainder</em>, branding <em>Netherland</em> an antiquated example of “a breed of lyrical realism [that] has had the freedom of the highway for some time now, with most other exits blocked”.<br /><br />

<p>Billed as a gen Z road trip film, the Ross brothers’ first fiction feature offers more than you’d expect from the genre, with a focus on human interaction over plot</p><p>In the opening seconds of the Ross brothers’ new film, a teenager professes his hope to discover a place “weirdos” like him can call home. The opening raises doubts about the novelty of what might follow: the trope of the high school outsider has been endlessly revisited. Gasoline Rainbow – billed as a gen Z road trip movie – starts off by replaying familiar images. As new high school graduates Makai, Micah, Nathaly, Nichole and Tony hit the road across Oregon for one final adventure together, we see the usual trappings of the genre: sing-alongs, parties by the campfire, and leaning out of car windows to enjoy the breeze and sweet call of freedom.</p><p>We move into welcome new territory when a mishap leaves their van out of action, and the group are left in the hot desert trying to scrounge a path forward, meetin

I painted my bedroom silver and slept on a mattress on the floor, and I grew sweetcorn, tomatoes and courgettes in pots on the balcony.

<p>Concrete is strong and durable – which is why it’s the basis for so much of our infrastructure. It’s also terrible for the planet, due to one key ingredient: cement, which is responsible for almost 90% of concrete emissions. Researchers have now found a way to recover old cement while also reducing the environmental impact of recycling steel.
