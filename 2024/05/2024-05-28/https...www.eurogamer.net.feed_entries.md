Later, Bloomberg's Jason Schreier - after viewing an internal Take-Two Interactive email to staff - <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-01/take-two-interactive-shuts-down-two-game-studios">reported</a> OlliOlli W

However, the pair's connection to the studio wasn't spotted <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rocksteady-co-founders-have-formed-new-london-aaa-studio-hundred-star-games">until early this year</a>, alongside the discovery a "handful of lead developers and director-level ex-Rocksteady employees" was already working there.

Capcom currently has remakes of both Resident Evil Zero and Resident Evil: Code Veronica in development, according to prominent leaker Dusk Golem. 
</p><p>
In a long thread of posts on social media platform X, <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1795075103169954210">Dusk Golem</a> attempted to clarify what has been a confusing time for claims about the future of the Resident Evil series, following the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-is-doing-incredibly-well">huge success of the recent Resident Evil 4 Remake</a>. 
</p><p>
Capcom's main team behind RE4 Remake is now worked on Code Veronica, Dusk Golem stated, while its secondary studio that worked on RE4 Remake's Separate Ways DLC is handling work on Zero.

Sega initially "flat out rejected" the first proposal for Yakuza, as it wouldn't attract the masses.
</p><p>
That's according to series creator Toshihiro Nagoshi on the latest <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxz5fP2iaeY">News Picks video</a>, in which he discusses the origins of the series (thanks <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/like-a-dragon-creator-talks-about-sega-flat-out-rejecting-the-first-yakuza-game-thinking-it-wouldnt-sell/">Automaton</a>).

</p><p>
The Like A Dragon series (Yakuza in the West) debuted in 2015, but initially wasn't seen as a profitable idea.

Square Enix has teased a HD-2D remake of Dragon Quest 3.
</p><p>
Yesterday, 27th May, was Dragon Quest day, celebrating the release of the original Dragon Quest game in Japan in 1986.
</p><p>
The short tease was shared on social media platform X featuring the Dragon Quest 3 logo with the words "The legacy begins". The post reads "The legend of Erdrick draws near", Erdrick being the most common name to refer to the third game's protagonist - chronologically the first in the series, though some fans are hoping for remakes of the first three games together.
