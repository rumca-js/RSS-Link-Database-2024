Over the past few months, I have faced persistent issues while trying to cancel my subscription, resulting in unwarranted charges for services I no longer use.</p> <p>I initially attempted to cancel my subscription on February 22, 2024. Despite receiving a confirmation message from the Customer Control Panel (CCP) stating that my server would be cancelled by April 9, 2024, I was subsequently billed again. Upon checking, I found no active cancellation. I repeated the process on March 20, 2024, with a new cancellation date of May 9, 2024. Again, I was charged, and no cancellation was in place.</p> <p>Frustrated, I contacted Netcup via email to resolve the issue. Despite multiple follow-ups, I was met with delays and unhelpful responses. I was informed that no cancellation requests had been received, which contradicted the confirmation messages I received from the CCP.</p> <p>Moreov

It allows you to bulk sync your subtitles to your media where bazarr itself have no option for bulk-opertations. It utilizes bazarr's api for the syncing .</p> <p>The main difference between it and the bazzar-bulk tool mentioned above is in case of errors (which i discovered are bazarr's own fault), bazarr-sync will skip that subtitle and move on. These issues mainly comes from bazarr where it could not sync the sub either it could not analyse the media's audio track or somehow could not fetch the subtitle.</p> <p>The tool is a weekend project so it might have some quirks here and there.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I've just exported my entire snapchat, instagram, and facebook accounts. Looking to use some offline tool to pump through them and filter my data before I back it up on a hard drive and deactivate my accounts. </p> <p>I need to filter out all the NSFW content that's accumulated over the years which is the only reason I'm doing this. A bonus would be to sort things by faces, cars, ect to share old memories with friends. </p> <p>My snapchat export is quite disgusting and PhotoPrism hasn't picked up 1 NSFW photo despite enabling it and reindexing a few times. </p> <p>My cat is being tagged as an Aircraft, Cars are tagged as boats, and a photo of my rubbish bin was tagged as a Baby??</p> <p>Appreciate the idea and may use this to manually host family photos but it has a long way to go to replace Google Photos. I might have to manually delete sensitive data, upload to Google Photos. Not ideal but better than snapchat having my data. </p> <p>Any suggestions

## Someone showed me a really awesome setup of a system where people request movies, it downloads them, and then allows them to stream. How is this done?

They were all self hosted and he just threw up a domain name service that allows people to visit a website, 'request' shows and movies, and then once they were downloaded, they could stream them.</p> <p>Basically a self hosted netflix kind of style. Would love to set up something like this for family, anyone know what might be used in this process?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Ardbert_The_Fallen"> /u/Ardbert_The_Fallen </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1d2b3cc/someone_showed_me_a_really_awesome_setup_of_a/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1d2b3cc/someone_showed_me_a_really_awesome_setup_of_a/">[comments]</a></span>

## Strange issues with Nextcloud AIO

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi homelab-ers! I have been running Plex for a few years now, and I'm trying to set up Nextcloud AIO in docker. Unfortunately, I'm stuck at the domain page in the initial setup. I have a domain name, I have dynamic dns set up, I have Docker allowed through my PC's firewall, I have forwarded the necessary ports in my router, and while I haven't confirmed it, it seems very likely that my ISP does not use CGNAT in my area and that I do indeed have a single static ip address assigned to my home. In spite of all of this, Nextcloud keeps throwing this error when I attempt to link it to my domain:</p> <pre><code>Domain does not point to this server or the reverse proxy is not configured correctly. See the mastercontainer logs for more details. ('sudo docker logs -f nextcloud-aio-mastercontainer') If you should be using Cloudflare, make sure to disable the Cloudflare Proxy feature as it might block the domain validation. Same for any other firewall or service

## What are the basic security measures a newbie selfhoster should take for their server?

I am not sure whether I have my security settings set correctly and how I can reinforce my server against potential attacks. Here's something I've done: Only allow 80 22 443 ports to be accessed. Disabled password authorization for ssh. Access is only granted by a rsa-2048 key with passphrase. Not allowed to log in as root. Everything except nginx runs in docker.</p> <p>Are these measures enough for most attacks?
