Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Donald Trump showed up to the Libertarian Party Convention, where he proceeded to taunt them right to their faces. It was a wonderful moment in the history of American politics. Also, Robert De Niro holds a press conference outside of Trump's trial in New York, for some unknown reason. It does not go well. Police in Florida are on a manhunt to track down the dangerous criminal who left tire marks on a rainbow-colored crosswalk. And, one of the hit songs on TikTok right now is a cheerful ode to the meaninglessness of life and the pointless nature of human existence.
