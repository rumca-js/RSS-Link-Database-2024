Council President Sara Nelson, who introduced the proposed legislation, issued a press release about an hour before Tuesday&#8217;s council meeting where councilmembers were expected to vote on the law. &#8220;Amendments to the legislation have been proposed and councilmembers have requested a postponement to ensure the Council has time to fully consider those changes,&#8221; the release stated.

The attack affected access to staff and public computers, online catalog and loaning systems, e-books and e-audiobooks, in-building Wi-Fi, and the Library website, which was still offline Tuesday morning. &#8220;The&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2024/cybersecurity-attack-on-seattle-public-library-impacts-multiple-tech-systems-and-online-services/\">Read More</a", "language": "en-US", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2024/cybersecurity-attack-on-seattle-public-library-impacts-multiple-tech-systems-and-online-services", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed", "source_obj__id": 131, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Cybersecurity attack on Seattle Public Library impacts multiple tech systems and online services", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-05-28T16:49:30+00:00", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"563\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/melindagates.jpg\" width=\"1000\" /><br />Melinda French Gates announced on Tuesday that she is planning to grant $1 billion over the next two years to programs and people working on women&#8217;s and family issues.

They&#8217;ve dealt with inflation, supply chain issues, labor shortages, and the fallout from remote work, among other hurdles. Another curveball was thrown into the mix for Seattle restaurants in January, when Uber Eats and DoorDash added a substantial $5/order fee for consumers in response to a new minimum pay legislation for drivers. Demand immediately dropped.
