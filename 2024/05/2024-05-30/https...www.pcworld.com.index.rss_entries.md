<p>I love multiple monitors. I love Legos. (And yes, fellow LEGO addicts, I know it&rsquo;s not supposed to have an &lsquo;s&rsquo; on the end, but I have to write for the normals.) Because of that, this new concept from HP might just be my favorite thing ever.</p>



<p>The idea? A series of microLED displays connected by near-seamless couplers that can assemble giant monitor arrays like puzzle pieces. It&rsquo;s barely even a concept at the moment &mdash; <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.tdcommons.org/dpubs_series/7031/&amp;xcust=2-1-2351021-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">just a technical paper</a> proposing various ways to do it &mdash; but it still has me excited.</p>



<p>There are three core components to this idea:</p>

<li>Small microLED LCD panels with no bezel</li>

<p>Have you ever wondered whether your USB ports are really delivering maximum power? There are several ways to find out. Windows offers you built-in functions to check the performance of your USB ports. At the same time, third-party apps and physical tools such as a voltmeter can provide information. </p>

<p>Wireless mice are awesome for freedom and comfort, but there&rsquo;s no response time quite as good as with wired mice. One reason why the Logitech G502 was such a legendary gaming mouse.</p>



<p>In 2022, an evolved model came out: the Logitech G502 X. When we <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1666963/logitech-g502x-mouse-review.html">reviewed the Logitech G502 X</a>, we concluded it had the best button configuration of any gaming mouse. It&rsquo;s currently our second-favorite wired gaming mouse.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a heavyweight matchup between the two VPN giants: ExpressVPN vs. NordVPN. They are the Godzilla and King Kong, Gates and Jobs, or Packers and Bears of the VPN world. Both offer some of the fastest, most secure, feature-rich services on the market. So which one should you choose?&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/398777/nordvpn-review-3.html">NordVPN</a> might be cheaper in the long-term and it offers more servers, but <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/395012/expressvpn-review-2.html">ExpressVPN</a> has a better privacy record and more consistent access to streaming services. While both are neck and neck, I recommend ExpressVPN for most folks. It&rsquo;s our pick for best VPN overall due to its ease-of-use, unrivaled transparency, and excellent streaming support. That&rsquo;s not to take anything away from NordVPN, which is

<p>For many years, Microsoft sold its productivity software Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and so on in a bundle called Microsoft Office. In 2013, the company saw where the software industry was heading and began a transition to a subscription-based model.</p>



<p>The suite of applications and a growing set of services continued to be called Office 365 until 2020, when it was given its current name, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/buy/compare-all-microsoft-365-products?&amp;activetab=tab:primaryr1&amp;xcust=2-1-2332852-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Microsoft 365</a>. The company would like to see all Windows users have a subscription, and is doing its best to entice them with advertising in Windows. This seems unnecessary, as the service is one of the most affordable s
