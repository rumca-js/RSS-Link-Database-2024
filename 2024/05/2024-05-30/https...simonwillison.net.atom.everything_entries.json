In ~2011, progress in AI felt constrained primarily by algorithms. We needed better ideas, better modeling, better approaches to make further progress. If you offered me a 10X bigger computer, I&#x27;m not sure what I would have even used it for. GPT-3 paper showed that there was this thing that would just become better on a large variety of practical tasks, if you only trained a bigger one. Better algorithms become a bonus, not a necessity for progress in AGI. Possibly not forever and going forward, but at least locally and for the time being, in a very practical sense. Today, if you gave me a 10X bigger computer I would know exactly what to do with it, and then I&#x27;d ask for more.</p></blockquote><p class=\"cite\">&mdash; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1795980744436932871\">Andrej Karpathy<", "language": "en-us", "link": "https://simonwillison.net/2024/May/30/andrej-karpathy/#atom-everything", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://simonwillison.net/atom/everything", "source_obj__id": 423, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Quoting Andrej Karpathy", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-05-30T07:19:36+00:00", "description": "<p><a href=\"https://mistral.ai/news/codestral/\">Codestral: Hello, World!</a></p>\nMistral's first code-specific model, trained to be \"fluent\" in 80 different programming languages.</p>\n<p>The weights are released under a new <a href=\"https://mistral.ai/news/mistral-ai-non-production-license-mnpl/\">Mistral AI Non-Production License</a>, which is extremely restrictive:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>3.2.
