<p>Inheritance and composition are two programming techniques developers use to establish the relationship between classes and objects. Whereas inheritance derives one class from another, composition defines a class as the sum of its parts.</p><p><a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2979739/java-101-classes-and-objects-in-java.html">Classes and objects</a> created through inheritance are <em>tightly coupled</em> because changing the parent or superclass in an inheritance relationship risks breaking your code. Classes and objects created through composition are <em>loosely coupled</em>, meaning that you can more easily change the component parts without breaking your code.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3409071/java-challenger-7-debugging-java-inheritance.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>

Global AI spending is expected to reach $300 billion by 2026. Also by 2026, AI’s electricity usage could increase tenfold, according to the International Energy Agency. Clearly, AI presents businesses with a dual challenge: maximizing AI’s capabilities while minimizing its environmental impact.</p><p>In the United States alone, power consumption by data centers is <a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/us-data-center-power-consumption/" rel="nofollow">expected to double by 2030</a>, reaching 35GW (gigawatts), primarily due to the growing demand for AI technologies.
