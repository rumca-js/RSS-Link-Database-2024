<p><strong>Takács Quartet<br />(Hyperion)<br /></strong>The group’s new recording of G major quartet is strikingly different from their intense 1997 recording, while the Haydnesque B flat is a model of good manners</p><p>The Takács have recorded the G major quartet, the last and most ambitious of Schubert’s string quartets, before, on <a href="https://music.apple.com/gb/album/schubert-string-quartet-no-15-piano-trio-in-e-flat/1452326472">a disc released by Decca in 1997</a>. Both the first violin Edward Dusinberre and the cellist András Fejér on that disc are still members of the group today, and play on the new version, which was recorded in the UK a year ago, but in some respects the two performances feel strikingly different.</p><p>Where the earlier reading seemed to be driven by nervous energy, every rhythm taut, every accent sharply etched, the new one seems much more relaxed, and distinctly less intense. The tempos for the first and last movements in particular feel markedly slo

<p>A focus group in Hitchen blames Liz Truss for their financial woes, is split on Rishi Sunak and still unsure about Keir Starmer</p><p>“Hopefully we can get on with it, because what we’ve got happening at the moment isn’t really working, is it?” That was how Gemma, a construction manager, reacted to last week’s general election announcement. She was one of nine undecided voters in the new parliamentary seat of Hitchin, in Hertfordshire, who More in Common spoke to as part of a focus group on Wednesday evening.</p><p>The participants were certainly not natural Labour voters. More than any other group we’ve spoken to this year, they were frustrated at high taxes and in particular the impact of fiscal drag and benefit cutoffs. Matt, an account manager, told us that rules around benefits thresholds and child benefit had “rankled him for years”. Ben, a facilities manager, said he had cut down the amount he worked to avoid hitting new thresholds, saying: “If everything goes up and the thr

<p>The fourth favourite for the Classic is owned by Bill Gredley, a self-made property millionaire from an East End family</p><p>In 1933, when Bill Gredley was born into a working-class family in the East End of London, it was a time when much of the local population would decamp to Epsom on the first Wednesday in June for an afternoon out at the Derby. And it is probably fair to say that the chance that Poplar’s newest resident would make the same trip 91 years later as the owner of one of the big-race favourites were slim to nil.</p><p>But Gredley has always been something of a one-off, in racing as in life. The self-made property millionaire once turned up at Royal Ascot sporting a morning suit, a top hat – and a ponytail, which caused a conniption among the ultra-conservatives in the Ascot fashion police. “They had a conference with the Queen and everybody, should they let me in?”, Gredley said this week. “I was talking to the Queen many years later and she was giggling about it.

<p>Facilities are not the best – and the government wants them out of their home – but long-term plan for qualification has paid off</p><p>The nets at the Lugogo Cricket Oval in Kampala, the capital of Uganda, are not ideal for a budding fast bowler. The lanes are set up on a concrete slab that only allows for a spinner’s run-up. Any brave soul wanting to fling the ball at pace has to negotiate an awkward step between the barren patch of land that borders the cricket field and the platform upon which the weathered nets reside. Mind your ankles.</p><p>But on a visit to the country nine years ago, I was struck by the queues of bowlers forming under the late afternoon sun, unperturbed by the prospect of injury as they skipped in to bowl. Some even donned Uganda shirts.

<p>Fast, furious and fresh, Sri Lankan-style vegetable curries take mere minutes to cook</p><p>If you’ve ever had Sri Lankan “rice and curry” for lunch, you’ll know the term is a misnomer. It’s not just one curry, but at least three and up to five that are served for lunch every day. How, you might wonder, is it possible to cook so many things in time for lunch? One of the answers is that Sri Lankan vegetable curries are fast and furious. Ingredients hit thin, metal saucepans in quick succession and are brought up to a Vesuvius-level boil, only to come out tasting surprisingly heavenly and delicate about 15 minutes later. The courgette is the perfect vegetable for such treatment: it’s tender , fresh and in need of a little spicing up.</p><p>Discover Meera’s recipes and many more from your favourite cooks in <a href="https://app.adjust.com/1bgiux9n?creative=Endnotes&amp;fallback=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fhelp%2Finsideguardian%2F2024%2Fapr%2F17%2Fintroducing-the-feast-app&amp;

<p>When my son, who is on the austim spectrum, was struggling, this classic game opened up his world. It continues to help lonely, isolated people find ways to connect and belong</p><p>A few days ago, I was tidying my home office – which more closely resembles a video game arcade recently hit by a tornado – when I found a long-lost piece of technology in the bottom drawer of my filing cabinet. It was an old Xbox 360, the Elite model – black, heavy, ungainly, impossibly retro. Out of curiosity, I hauled it out, found a controller and power cable and switched it on. I knew immediately what I wanted to look for, but I was also apprehensive: I didn’t know how I’d feel if Minecraft was still there – or worse, if it wasn’t. Minecraft, you see, is more than just a game for me. I thought about just putting the console back where I found it. But as this month sees the 15th anniversary of the game’s original release, I felt I had to go on.</p><p>In 2012, Microsoft held a big Xbox Games Showcase

<p>The artist’s daughter tells the compelling story of sitting for him, but too often gets lost in the detail</p><p>Autobiography tells the whole story of a life. It leaves nothing, or little, out. This is because autobiography is the province of famous people. The writer of autobiography – that is, the famous person – doesn’t need to work to gain the reader’s attention; that attention already exists. Therefore, all events are of interest. Memoir, on the other hand, must earn the reader’s attention, because the writer of memoir – that is, a person hitherto unknown to their audience – recognises her story is not of inherent importance. The way memoir makes a story is by leaving things out. It’s hard, disciplined work. Life feels infinite to each of us, like a massive eternally unfurling bolt of fabric – fabric that must be cut to make a story. This cutting is how a memoirist takes care of her reader. Structure in the memoir, then, has to do with what is omitted.</p><p>Rose Boyt’s new b

## Spiced fish and herby broad beans: Yotam Ottolenghi’s spring sandwich recipes

<p>Controversial, maybe, but these sandwich fillings dial up the taste factor and fit pretty well in a soft white roll</p><p>If I was forced to choose, I’d say I’m a butter, cheese and pickles man. I love mine open and I tend to go for sourdough, even if that does induce eye-rolls from many. I’m talking, of course, about sandwiches, a subject on which everyone has wonderfully strong opinions. What bread to use? Cut it on the diagonal or straight down the middle? Is it OK for anyone over the age of seven to cut off the crusts? And that’s before you even start discussing what’s going inside. Slices of tomato: sublime or soggy? A handful of crisps: critical or criminal? A lettuce leaf or two: lovely or limp? Fish finger sandwiches: right or wrong? Such seemingly innocent questions, yet ones that incite such firm feelings. (My reply to that last question, incidentally, is revealed by today’s first recipe, which takes the concept, dials it up and feels pretty strongly about the presence of

<p>The election has stalled the regulator’s progress, but is perhaps a chance for women’s football to be given proper consideration</p><p>The general election has put the government’s legislation <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/may/23/football-independent-regulator-plans-paused-general-election">for an independent football regulator on hold</a>. With both the Conservatives and Labour supporting the proposal, it should return to parliament regardless of who wins. This delay provides an ideal opportunity for a rethink. To date, the women’s game hasn’t been properly considered in the discussions and deliberations.</p><p>Let’s start with the IFR’s name. It’s actually the independent men’s football regulator as the women’s game hasn’t been included.

<p>A Franco-Algerian family’s struggles since the second world war are intimately captured across continents and generations</p><p>Claire Messud’s ambitious and compelling novel covers the lives of three generations of a Franco-Algerian family. Here are some of the events that are not&nbsp;described in it: the Algerian war of independence, as a result of which the Cassar family lose their home and national identity; the two years the family’s most promising scion spends as a student in Paris, during which he endures something (racist bullying? Mental collapse?) that blights his adult life; his sister’s broken-hearted suicide attempt; an alcoholic’s hard-won recovery; the courtship of a couple who have been held up throughout the novel as exemplars of married love and yet whose relationship – as we discover only in the final pages – was shockingly transgressive. Any of these developments could have provided more than enough material for the plot of a lesser novel. Here they take place

<p>Lady Parts head for the recording studio – but new rivals are waiting in the wings. Plus: haunting memories resurface in The Tattooist of Auschwitz. Here’s what to watch this evening</p><p><strong>10pm, Channel 4</strong><strong><br /></strong>Nida Manzoor’s rollicking comedy about an all-female Muslim punk band – complete with original bangers – is back for a second season, and Lady Parts have just finished a summer of touring. With a growing fanbase behind them, it’s time to put an album together, but the £200 profit they made won’t cover the studio time. However, bassist and newly qualified doctor Amina (Anjana Vasan) is in her “villain era” so can make anything happen. Then a rival band come to the fore with the undeniably cool name of Second Wife. Lady Parts, of course, support the sisterhood – and there’s room for more than one band of Muslim women in the industry … right? Great fun. <strong>Hollie Richardson</strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/arti
