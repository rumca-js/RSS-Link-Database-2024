The Acolyte is set near the end of the High Republic, approximately 100 years before The Phantom Menace. But while the time frame is different, some Star Wars constants remain. In a newly posted video, The Acolyte's creator Leslye Headland and Lucasfilm's chief creative officer Dave Filoni spoke about some of the parallels between the story in the new show and what we've seen in the previous Star Wars tales.</p><div>          </div><p>"What I was interested in examining were the Sith," said Headland in the video.

<p>Ahead of the launch of The Final Shape expansion next week, Bungie has unveiled a Dungeons &amp; Dragons crossover for Destiny 2. Like previous collaborations, players will be able to don stylish armor sets inspired by the popular tabletop game franchise, including Faerûn inspired armor for all classes. The new armor sets include the Apex Draconic set for Titans, the Spectral Displacer set for Hunters, and the Flayer’s Dominion set for Warlocks. There'll also be an Owlbear Chariot, Queen of Dragons ship, the Eye Tyrant Ghost Shell, and more added to Destiny 2 when the crossover rolls out.</p><p>It's worth noting that these are purely cosmetic pieces of armor and they have no effect on your gear's stats or properties. These premium armor ornaments typically require you to spend some cash to own them and previous collaborations have been priced at 2,000 Silver, or around $20 in real-world cash. This isn't the first time Destiny 2 has crossed over with another popular franchise, as pr

<p>There's initially something so tantalizing about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/rkgk-rakugaki/">RKGK / Rakugaki</a>'s bold usage of color in its anime-inspired art style. From the jump, the game's story seems rambunctious and absurd in the best possible way, accompanied by gameplay where split-second decisions reward your well-timed jumps and dashes with brief explosions of color. As the game continues, however, the aesthetic of each level begins to run together and the underlying narrative loses steam, leaving only the platforming challenges to evolve in any meaningful way. So even though the story doesn't leave a lasting impression, your acrobatic escapades through each level do, carrying the game to gratifying heights.</p><p dir="ltr">In RKGK, you play as street artist-turned-rebel Valah, who is set on taking her city back from Mr. Buff, a rotund megalomaniac set on enslaving the populace with hypnotizing billboard screens and an army of robots.

<p>The Lord of the Rings films are more than 20 years old but the former stars of the history-making franchise still find ways to integrate them into new projects. In his latest film, Oscar nominee Viggo Mortensen called upon Aragorn's sword once again in a scene for a blink-and-you-miss-it moment. </p><p>The Dead Don’t Hurt, a Western set in the 1860s, follows free-spirited Vivienne (Vicky Krieps), a Franco-Canadian who falls in love with Holger (Mortensen), a Danish rancher.

<p>In 2021, Universal Pictures and Blumhouse announced ambitious plans to bring back The Exorcist franchise with a new sequel trilogy. However, the rocky reception that The Exorcist: Believer received in theaters last year forced the studios to rethink the path forward. Believer co-writer and director David Gordon Green stepped down from the previously revealed sequel, The Exorcist: Deceiver. And that ultimately led <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mike-flanagan-in-negotiations-to-direct-the-exorcist-deceiver/1100-6523174/">Mike Flanagan to enter talks with Universal and Blumhouse</a> about taking over.</p><p>Now, Flanagan has officially signed on to write, direct, and produce "a radical new take" on the next Exorcist film. As a result, plans for Deceiver and the other film in the new Exorcist trilogy have been canceled. Flanagan's movie will take place in the same continuity as the previous Exorcist flicks, but it's not a direct sequel to anything.</p><p>Horror fans are ver
