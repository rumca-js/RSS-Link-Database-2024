Stealth missions don\u2019t work quite as well but they\u2019re mostly optional, and the story, heroes, and villains are entertainingly written throughout the substantial campaign.\n\n#IGN #Gaming", "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUjrold-ldU", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "source_obj__id": 149, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/pUjrold-ldU/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Capes Review", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-05-30T23:05:49+00:00", "description": "Watch Omega Force's first gameplay trailer for Dynasty Warriors Origins coming to PlayStation 5.\n\n#IGN #Gaming #PS5", "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiBJLWWv0sk", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "source_obj__id": 149, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/eiBJLWWv0sk/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Dynasty Warriors Origins - Official Gameplay Trailer (4K) | State of Play 2024", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-05-30T23:03:33+00:00", "description": "Take a look at the first gameplay trailer for Monster Hunter: Wilds, Capcom's newest entry in their beloved franchise coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and PC in 2025.\n\n#IGN #Gaming #PS5", "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WwrJSTlBPk", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "source_obj__id": 149, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/-WwrJSTlBPk/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Monster Hunter: Wilds - Official Gameplay Trailer (4K) | State of Play 2024", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-05-30T23:02:23+00:00", "description": "Watch the gameplay trailer for Where Winds Meet from Everystone Studio, headed to PlayStation 5.\n\n#IGN #Gaming #PS5", "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBkyL7R2B4k", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "source_obj__id": 149, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/rBkyL7R2B4k/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Where Winds Meet - Official Announce Trailer (4K) | State of Play 2024", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-05-30T22:57:43+00:00", "description": "Watch the cinematic trailer for Concord, a 5v5 first-person shooter from Firewalk launching August 23, 2024.\n\n#IGN #StateOfPlay #SummerOfGaming", "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR2VEwuD9Hg", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "source_obj__id": 149, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/mR2VEwuD9Hg/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Concord - Official Cinematic Trailer (4K) | State of Play 2024", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-05-30T22:56:04+00:00", "description": "Watch the reveal trailer for Ballad of Antara, coming to PlayStation 5 in 2025.\n\n#IGN #StateOfPlay #SummerOfGaming", "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inIJf_zWcT8", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "source_obj__id": 149, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/inIJf_zWcT8/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Ballad of Antara - Official Reveal Trailer (4K) | State of Play 2024", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-05-30T22:53:34+00:00", "description": "God of War: Ragnarok is coming to PC September 19, 2024.
