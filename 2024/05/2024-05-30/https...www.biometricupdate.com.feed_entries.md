		Erika Piirmets has been a digital citizen since she was a child. When she started primary school in Estonia in the late 1990s, her class switched from paper to digital diaries. In high school, she had her first encounter with the digital state when she enrolled for national exams online. She has never signed a physical work contract nor seen a paper tax declaration form and she casts her votes during elections electronically.

Estonia is now home to thousands of citizens who consider digital as the default. The Baltic state of 1.3 million people has become a role model for the digitalization of state services across the world.

But the country doesn’t plan to stop there, according to Piirmets, who now works as a Digital Transformation Adviser for the country’s e-governm

		The inaugural evaluation of biometric age estimation technologies previewed at the Global Age Assurance Standards Summit 2024 has been published. It shows significant differences in accuracy among the half-dozen developers submitting algorithms.

U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology Biometric Standards and Testing Lead Patrick Grother told a Summit audience during the preview that the results show that biometric age estimation is potentially as effective as checking a date of birth field on an ID document.

The <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/frvt/html/frvt_age_estimation.html">newest track</a> in NIST’s Face Analysis Technology Evaluation (FATE) activity breaks down age estimation algorithms according to their effectiveness for “Challenge 25

		Resetting a password for an account with multi-factor authentication (MFA) enabled can often lead to challenges that sometimes require users to seek assistance from customer support and undergo identity verification.

<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/nametag">Nametag</a> has introduced a potential solution by allowing users to securely enroll new MFA devices using a government-issued ID and a selfie photo. This enhancement in the MFA reset process addresses a crucial vulnerability frequently exploited by malicious actors, which could result in account takeovers and data breaches.

The U.S. patent office has granted Nametag patent <a href="https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/66/1a/35/094b8b69b343ca/US11949787.pdf">11949787</a> for “Systems and
