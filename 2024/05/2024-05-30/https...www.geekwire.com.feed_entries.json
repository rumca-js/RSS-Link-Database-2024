He recently shared his story on the Startup Project podcast.&#160; Singh\u2019s passion for data started at a young age, sparked by his fascination with numerology. He went on to build a successful shoe business, Jacksin.co.uk, before moving to Seattle to work for Expedia, where he led product development for platform and marketplaces. It was this experience, combined with his brother&#8217;s unique insights on modern biotech, that led him to co-found Scispot.
