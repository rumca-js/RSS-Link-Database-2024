At this evening's State of Play, we got another look at Bloober's upcoming Silent Hill 2 remake. 
</p><p>
Perhaps learning from its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bloobers-silent-hill-2-remake-gets-fresh-airing-in-combat-focused-trailer">previous combat-focused tease</a>, the Silent Hill 2 Remake team went down the more atmospheric route for this trailer. Gone were the parkouring nurses from yore, and in its place we got crumbling gravestones, creaking floorboards and plenty of fog. After all, this is Silent Hill! 
</p><p>
The trailer gave us all a closer look at James, the game's protagonist. He is trying to get to Silent Hill, having received a letter from his deceased wife. "James heads to where they shared so many memories, in the hope of seeing her one more time," the trailer description reads. You can chec

Sony has announced a new Astro Bot game during tonight's PlayStation State of Play. It's simply called Astro Bot, is once again developed by Sony's Team Asobi, and launches for PlayStation 5 on 6th September.
</p><p>
A charming-enough-looking platformer, this is Astro's first starring role since 2020's PS5 launch title Astro's Playroom. 
</p><p>
In the past, Astro has been used as a showcase for Sony's hardware, with Playroom designed to show off the PS5 DualSense, just as 2018's Astro Bot Rescue Mission was built for PlayStation VR.

Tonight brings our first proper look at Concord, as part of the latest PlayStation State of Play. 
</p><p>
The first new game developed by Sony's Firewalk Studios, Concord is a sci-fi shooter for PlayStation 5 and PC with a beta in July and a full launch on 23rd August. 
</p><p>
There's bags of character on show in the game's cinematic reveal trailer - which clearly owes a lot to James Gunn's Guardians of the Galaxy trilogy. Interestingly, Sony has said that each week will bring another small slice of story via a similar vignette, containing deeper dives at the game's characters and ongoing narratives.

Boy! You read that right - God of War Ragnar&ouml;k is coming to PC. 
</p><p>
The news came as part of this evening's State of Play, with Sony adding it will come with its Valhalla DLC included. An accompanying <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/05/30/god-of-war-ragnarok-is-coming-to-pc/">blog post</a> notes that an "account for PlayStation Network is required" - something unlikely to please fans <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-steam-players-will-soon-need-to-link-a-psn-account-and-they-arent-happy">after the Helldivers 2 debacle</a>.

In Dungeons of Hinterberg, refreshingly little. But the more I played of this strange and lovely combination of dungeon diver and life sim, the more I realised that wasn't quite the case. Sure, in terms of the stakes of a lot of video games, Hinterberg's are definitely quite low. You're on holiday and your job, in essence, is to relax. But sometimes just getting away and having a break is really pretty important. A few hours in, I realised that I wanted to do it properly.</p><p>Dungeons of Hinterberg is a game about Luisa, who's training to be a lawyer and is young and thoroughly burned out. She's come to Hinterberg, which is a sweet Alpine town touched by magic, to do what all tourists here do. They stroll and eat cakes and sit by the lake, certainly. But they also descend into a range of dungeons to whack enemi
