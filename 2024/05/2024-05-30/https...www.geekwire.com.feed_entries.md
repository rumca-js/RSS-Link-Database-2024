The business launched last year and takes a somewhat unusual approach to helping companies, organizations and individuals reduce their carbon emissions.

Climate Vault Solutions is the sales and marketing arm of Climate Vault platform, which is a nonprofit initiative based in Chicago and founded in 2021.

Carbon capture technology for industrial sites isn’t new, it&#8217;s just typically applied to bigger facilities such as large power plants. &#8220;We saw this as a really big problem and really big opportunity.&#8221; &#8211; Shane Johnson, CarbonQuest co-founder and CEO But the small emitters are much more numerous, with about&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/this-spokane-startup-catches-carbon-dioxide-at-the-source-before-it-escapes-to-the-environment/">Read More</a>

It&#8217;s a key milestone in the company&#8217;s longstanding effort to deliver packages via drone, an initiative unveiled more than a decade ago by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos in a segment on &#8220;60 Minutes.&#8221; Amazon says the approval was granted after it demonstrated its onboard detect-and-avoid technology, ensuring drones can safely navigate around obstacles, as&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/amazon-plans-major-expansion-of-drone-deliveries-after-winning-key-faa-approval/">Read More</a>
