## ASK HN: The Required Fundamentals for Self-Taught Programming

<p>I have been wondering which programming fundamentals are needed for using in real projects and the fundamentals in computer science needed. I already can read code, but don´t know how to apply that effectively. Any suggestions? Like books and resources?</p>

## Stripe closed our account and refuses to migrate our data to another processor

<p>I'm reaching out to the official Stripe support forum here because our account has been closed and Stripe is refusing to export our card data. We are set to lose half our revenue in recurring Stripe subscriptions with no way to migrate them and no recourse. Our crime? Not predicting Stripe's future policies.<p>We run a dating app. We've been using Stripe for the past 2 years and this wasn't a problem when we signed up, but apparently "all online dating services" was added to the Restricted Businesses list last year (without notice) and now our account has been flagged. Fair enough, there are some sketchy dating apps out there, but we are much closer to Tinder/Bumble/etc. (albeit smaller) than to the mail order bride / escort service end of the spectrum. We take moderation very seriously, have never had any safety incidents, no sexual content, we maintain a low 0.05% dispute rate. Apple and Google happily process our mobile payments, we've had major press, we're as legit as a dating

## Ask HN: I have many PDFs – what is the best local way to leverage AI for search?

<p>As the title says, I have many PDFs - mostly scans via Scansnap - but also non-scans. These are sensitive in nature, e.g. bills, documents, etc. I would like a local-first AI solution that allows me to say things like: "show me all tax documents for August 2023" or "show my home title". Ideally it is Mac software that can access iCloud too, since that where I store it all. I would prefer to not do any tagging. I would like to optimize on recall over precision, so False Positives in the search results are ok. What are modern approaches to do this, without hacking one up on my own?</p>

<p>Hi, co-founder of markets.sh here. We are doing a lot of news processing and analysis around stocks and companies. One feature people like to use is “alerts” at certain price points. We have now extended this with LLM filters on the whole news feed so that you can create (near) real-time webhooks on arbitrary events like:<p>- Notify me when Nvidia is worth 10 trillion
- Notify me about AI breakthroughs
- Notify me when Intel is the market leader again
- Notify me about successful Starship launches
- Notify me when a war breaks out
- Notify me about bankrupt unicorn startups
- Notify me about significant economic events<p>The feature is still very early. If you write that you’re from Hacker News in the support chat, I’ll give personal support. Would greatly appreciate all feedback</p>

## Ask HN: What do devs use for quickly setting up a feedback form?

<p>I'm a software engineer who keeps building little web apps / MVP landing pages in the hopes that they make me a pretty penny (they never do). I like adding basic forms to the websites; usually to collect feedback, sometimes with an optional email address so I can get back to people.<p>I've tried 3 options so far:<p>- fully-fledged forms embedded onto the website (eg Google Forms) - quickest to set up but absolutely hideous and bad for SEO<p>- 3rd-party form backends - I'm constantly worried about hitting the free plan limit; and some services have some deliverability/uptime issues<p>- writing up my own server (I use Go) and hooking it up to a 3rd-party email service; cheapest but more worried about deliverability/uptime<p>Right now I'm gravitating towards the 2nd option, but am curious how other developers approach this problem.</p>

## Ask HN: How can we open-source a 7 year old SaaS codebase and build a community?

<p>Hello HN! We’re currently open-sourcing our core code (backend and frontend) and pivoting to adding value with LLMs on top. With this, we need some advice.<p>I'm Kirill Markin, and my co-founder is Nikolay Amiantov. We've been working on our CRM/ERP product since 2017 and even have paying customers. But our growth is slow, and that's not exciting. We want to create something bigger for more people to use, and open-sourcing is something that both resonates with us and is a way to attract a community.<p>Our codebase is 38k LoC of F# (including a compiler for our own query language) and 35k LoC of TypeScript + Vue.js. While we prepare the code we have been reaching out to Zoho and ODOO integrators/developers (as they’re our closest competitors), from whom we got a lot of positive feedback.<p>Our biggest hurdle is figuring out the best way to take the next steps. Does anyone have any ideas on how to launch such a large codebase on GitHub to get maximum visibility? Suggestions on buildi

<p>I was inspired by the way ChatGPT writes bullet lists, then invites you to "delve" deeper.<p>This is an interface that reifies that rabbit-holing process into a tiling layout. The model is instructed to output hyperlink-prompts when it mentions something you might want to delve into.<p>Lots of features to add (sessions, sharing, navigation, highlight-to-delve, images, ...). Would love to hear other usecases and ideas!</p>

## Show HN: I built a tiny-VPS friendly RSS aggregator and reader

<p>Hi, folks.<p>As an RSS user, I tried Inoreader and Feedly, then ended up self-hosting a Miniflux instance on my homelab. A few months ago, I moved to another city and had to shut down my homelab for a long time, so I couldn't access my local miniflux. It was quite inconvenient. I decided to self-host my RSS aggregator on a tiny VPS or PaaS such as fly.io. However, Miniflux requires a PostgreSQL database, which may isn't suitable for a tiny VPS instance.<p>So I built fusion with Golang and SQLite. It contains basic features such as Group, Bookmark, Search, Automatically feeds sniffing, Import/Export OPML file, etc. It uses about 80MB of Mem and negligible CPU usage (metrics here: <a href="https://imgur.com/a/EJIdevn" rel="nofollow">https://imgur.com/a/EJIdevn</a>).<p>Feel free to share your questions and suggestions.<p>BTW, I also built an online tool to sniff RSS links from a URL.

## Google Console closed testing requirements are awful

<p>I have been coding for 2-3 years and decided to make my first mobile app, just something small and simple to get a feel for it.<p>I wanted to publish it to the play store, get exposure and share what I have made. I paid the $25 fee, submitted my passport and bank statements for ID verification, and started the process to get my app published.<p>Well, what a terrible experience. It is not user friendly at all, and the requirement of 20 testers opting in to your closed testing for 14 days makes very little sense. I have spent the last few days messaging people, doing the test swaps, and generally wasting my time.<p>I have seen, from searching to find places that I can recruit testers, a number of 'services' where you can simply pay to have your app 'tested'. The whole thing has been really off-putting, what is the point..?<p>I wanted to make a flutter app next, something more detailed and complex.. but I am dreading having to go through this process of 'closed testing', after spendin

## Show HN: Resource Index – FOSS Git Repository and NPM Package Index

<p>Resource Index (res-index) is a searchable index for development resources, including github repo and npm packages.<p>Why yet another index?<p>In short, the search functionality on google and github are unsatisfied. This project aim to build a better alternative and potentially improve google's search result.<p>What's the actual problem I'm facing?<p>Sometime I want to search for a npm package but google cannot return that result even after I added "npm", "github", or even the combination of exact author username and package name.<p>Similarly, it's sometime hopeless to search for a non-popular package by name on github if you cannot recall the author's username.<p>Sometime google can not show the corresponding npm page but instead shows it on "socket.dev" or "snyk.io".<p>Pasting the exact npm url in subsequence search doesn't seem effective at hinting google to index the pages.<p>This project aim to actively index some github repositories and npm packages to enable more inclusive s

## Show HN: Right-click and save content directly to Google Sheets

<p>I released the initial version of the Add to Sheets Chrome extension recently. With the extension, you can predefine the destination sheet and column where you want to save content, and then save/add content from any webpage with a right-click. Almost like Pinterest for GSheets - instead of copy/paste, you can right-click/save.</p>

## Ask HN: How do you find what you're good at and make money?

<p>I used to be a moderately high performer in just about everything - grades, sports, hobbies, college jobs, and even my first few years of professional life. Now I seem to be below average in most of those things. Like I'm in some sort of extended burnout across almost every category of life.<p>The most concerning part is my job. I've been getting a roller coaster of reviews for years. I'll get a good rating one year and a bad one the next. How can I find a job I'm actually good at? I'm a midlevel dev with about 12 yoe. I guess I should also mention I'm autistic.</p>
