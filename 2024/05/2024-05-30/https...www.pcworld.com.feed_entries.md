<p>If you want to be competitive in PC games these days, you can forget about using a run-of-the-mill office mouse. Instead, you&rsquo;ll need a powerful device that&rsquo;s optimized just for gaming. </p>



<p>Manufacturers go to great pains to design specialist devices that give players an edge, with enhancements like unique body sizes and shapes, customizable weight, and extra grips to increase speed and accuracy. On top of that, the best gaming mice have unique hardware enhancements like highly sensitive sensors and complex button configurations to keep up with fast-paced games. </p>



<p>Deciding on the right mouse is a highly personal decision that needs careful consideration. Factors like the size and shape of your hand, your preferred grip style, the types of games you play, and the number of buttons you need, are all factors in your quest for the best gam

<p>Don&rsquo;t let your favorite music and movies go to waste as you play them through your laptop&rsquo;s built-in sound system. Your audio can come out sounding weak and lifeless with even the best laptop speakers. External PC speakers &mdash; along with a <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/544134/the-best-wireless-earbuds-free-yourself-from-the-tyranny-of-cords.html">good set of headphones</a> &mdash; are essential for getting the best fidelity from your media files.</p>



<p>Luckily, you don&rsquo;t need to buy a complete 7.1 surround sound system to make up for it. For less than $100, you can find some affordable speakers that provide quality audio. It&rsquo;s true that at this price point you will need to make a few compromises, but the best budget computer speakers can still offer a satisfying listening experience while saving you money, and that&rsquo

<p>April Fools&rsquo; Day is the bane of any tech news writer&rsquo;s existence. Never mind that these sad attempts at comedy from marketing people are sometimes barely distinguishable from real products &mdash; especially when they come days or weeks before April 1st. I always have to be on guard, and Nvidia has decided to make my job even harder.</p>



<p>Back in 2017, Nvidia made an April Fools&rsquo; joke introducing the &ldquo;GTX G-Assist,&rdquo; a USB device you could plug into your gaming PC that would literally play games for you.</p>



<p>The tongue-in-cheek video described a system that was essentially a game bot, which would mimic your personal play style and even emote and taunt when appropriate. Less believable parts included ordering pizza for you or alerting you when your energy drinks were sufficiently cooled in the fridge.</p>

<p>I love my home office, but sometimes I prefer taking my laptop to a nearby coffee shop to work. What I don&rsquo;t like, however, is having to rely on a single laptop screen when I&rsquo;m on the go.</p>



<p>A portable extra screen would be so useful, wouldn&rsquo;t it? Imagine my surprise when I saw that the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://amazon.com/Portable-Arzopa-External-Speakers-Included/dp/B09PYKCF1Z&amp;xcust=2-1-2350757-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Arzopa A1 Gamut Slim is down to $76</a> for Amazon Prime members. Normally available for $130, this 14-inch portable monitor is an absolute bargain at this price.</p>

<p>Sightful&rsquo;s Spacetop, the laptop with no screen that we saw demo&rsquo;d last year, has entered commercial availability with the Spacetop G1, a faster, more polished version that will be available later this year for a relatively reasonable $1,900.</p>
