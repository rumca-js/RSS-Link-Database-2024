<p>Bloober Team's remake of <em>Silent Hill 2</em> is due to hit PlayStation 5 and PC on October 8, and it's looking nice and spooky.

<p>Sony’s lovable robo-mascot is getting a new game. During its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/how-to-watch-sonys-playstation-state-of-play-event-this-evening-130041039.html">PlayStation State of Play</a> on Thursday, Sony dropped a trailer for the upcoming PS5 title <em>Astro Bot</em>. The 3D Mario-esque title, a sequel to the beloved pack-in, <em>Astro’s Playroom</em>, arrives on September 6.</p>
<p>The trailer sees our pal Astro wading through puddles full of pink flamingos, grappling across platforms like Bionic Commando and summoning a PS5 console to help fight a giant green alien in a UFO (as one tends to do). In a nod to old-school PlayStation, the trailer even includes a cameo from PaRappa the Rapper.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Sony describes <em>Astro Bot</em> as a “supersized adventure” that spans over six galaxies and 80 levels as you search for your lost crew. You’ll have over 15 new abilities, and, like in its predecessor, it will serve as a showcase

<p>OpenAI said that it stopped five covert influence operations that used its AI models for deceptive activities across the internet. These operations, which OpenAI shutdown between 2023 and 2024, originated from Russia, China, Iran and Israel and attempted to manipulate public opinion and influence political outcomes without revealing their true identities or intentions, the company <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://openai.com/index/disrupting-deceptive-uses-of-AI-by-covert-influence-operations/">said</a> on Thursday. “As of May 2024, these campaigns do not appear to have meaningfully increased their audience engagement or reach as a result of our services,” OpenAI said in a <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://downloads.ctfassets.net/kftzwdyauwt9/5IMxzTmUclSOAcWUXbkVrK/3cfab518e6b10789ab8843bcca18b633/Threat_Intel_Report.pdf">report</a> about the operation, and added that it worked with people across the tech industry, civil society and governments to cut off these ba

<p>Save for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/destiny-2/"><em>Destiny 2</em></a>, it's been a long time since there's been a first-person shooter from a PlayStation studio. As such, there's been quite a bit of interest in Firewalk Studios' <em>Concord </em>since it was announced a year ago.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We learned more details about the sci-fi game during <a href="https://www.engadget.com/how-to-watch-sonys-playstation-state-of-play-event-this-evening-130041039.html">Sony's State of Play showcase</a>, including a release date and the first look at gameplay. It's coming to PS5 and PC on August 23. (Heads up: You will <a href="https://www.engadget.com/what-the-heck-is-going-on-with-helldivers-2-163829512.html">need a PlayStation Network account</a> to play on PC.)

Sony gave the announcement at its State of Play event after <a href="https://www.engadget.com/an-until-dawn-remake-is-coming-to-ps5-and-pc-this-year-191524477.html">teasing the game earlier this year</a>. The company also dropped a new trailer, and it certainly looks like a spooky delight. In other words, that fall release date is starting to make sense from a themed holiday perspective.</p>
<div id="b1d30cdee08843b2aa5b39ea39716d75"></div>
<p>The <em>Until Dawn</em> remake was built in Unreal Engine 5 and boasts several new features that were missing from the original PS4 title. You'll be able to experience the action from a third-person perspective for the first time, which is pretty neat.

<p>Sony has ported lots of its biggest games to PC recently, and the <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/05/30/god-of-war-ragnarok-is-coming-to-pc/">next one will be</a> <em>God of War Ragnarok</em>. As part of the State of Play presentation, Sony showed off a trailer for the most recent adventure of Kratos and his son Atreus, and it looks as good as ever. It'll have unlocked frame rates, ultra widescreen monitor support and plenty more visual trickery for PC players, and it'll also include the <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-is-getting-a-free-roguelite-expansion-next-week-015012803.html">recently-released Valhalla DLC.</a> It's not a huge surprise, given that the 2018 revival <em>God of War </em>also came to PC a few years ago, but it'll be welcomed by those who want to continue the journey.</p>
<p>As far as visual upgrades go, Sony confirmed in its blog that it'll support NVIDIA RTX DLSS, AMD FidelityFX

<p>The hits keep on coming with NASA’S James Webb Space Telescope. According to the space agency, the JWST just found the <a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/webb/2024/05/30/nasas-james-webb-space-telescope-finds-most-distant-known-galaxy/">most distant known galaxy</a> ever. The catchily-named JADES-GS-z14-0 galaxy is said to have formed just 290 million years after the big bang, but it features some unique properties that are at odds with that notion.</p>
<p>The galaxy is incredibly large, at 1,600 light years across. It’s also very bright and features an unusual amount of starlight, given how soon it formed after the big bang. This has led researchers Stefano Carniani and Kevin Hainline to ask “how can nature make such a bright, massive, and large galaxy in less than 300 million years?” In cosmic time, that’s barely a blip.</p>

<p>I remember being a kid and seeing my grandmother without her dentures for the first time. It was a harrowing experience. Now my dad has dentures so, genetically speaking, I’m several decades out from needing some myself. However, it’s possible that modern medicine will solve the issue of lost teeth by then, thanks to a new drug that's about to enter human trials.</p>
<p>The medicine <a href="https://www.kyoto-u.ac.jp/en/research-news/2021-03-31">quite literally regrows teeth</a> and was developed by a team of Japanese researchers, <a href="https://newatlas.com/medical/tooth-regrowing-human-trial/"><ins>as reported by </ins><em><ins>New Atlas</ins></em></a>. The research has been led by Katsu Takahashi, head of dentistry and oral surgery at Kitano Hospital.

Blocking USAG-1 from interacting with other proteins triggers bone growth and, voila, you got yourself so

<p>Instagram first experimented with Note Prompts earlier this year, and the feature allows users to share questions such as &quot;What should I eat?&quot; or &quot;Who is going to be in X city this weekend?&quot; Friends can then respond with tips, suggestions and random thoughts on the subject. It feels very Facebook circa 2012, as does another new feature, Mentions, in which users can tag a friend directly in their Notes.

<p>Sony’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sonys-next-playstation-state-of-play-takes-place-may-30-141703664.html"><ins>next PlayStation State of Play livestream event</ins></a> kicks off this evening at 6PM ET and it's extremely easy to watch. The stream will be available on the company’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@PlayStation/videos"><ins>YouTube page</ins></a>, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@playstation"><ins>on Twitch</ins></a> and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@playstation"><ins>even TikTok</ins></a>. Sony says the event should last around 30 minutes.</p>
<p>So what’s on the agenda? The company promises the stream will spotlight 14 games coming to the PS5 and PS VR2. Sony hasn’t announced many first-party titles for the months and years ahead, so this should finally give us a glimpse into the future of both the PS5 and its VR headset accessory. Wait, 14 games in 30 minutes? You had better not take a break to make popcorn.</p>

<p>While <em>Minecraft</em> was officially released in 2011, it was first introduced to the public back in 2009. This year, <em>Minecraft</em> is celebrating its 15th anniversary, and as part of the festivities surrounding that milestone, Netflix and Mojang Studios have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf7TC0poGlg">announced</a> that they're making an animated series based on the iconic sandbox game. It's a computer graphic-animated show that's being developed by Canadian studio WildBrain, which was also behind the animated Netflix shows <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-25-netflix-interactive-carmen-sandiego-special.html"><em>Carmen Sandiego</em></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sonic-prime-netflix-animated-series-2022-144030265.html"><em>Sonic Prime</em></a>.</p>

<p>While the cinema is still the best way to experience movies, it’s admittedly hard (and expensive!) to corral kids for a theater trip. And don’t even bring up babysitting costs. These days, it’s far easier to turn your house into the perfect entertainment cocoon, with all of your required creature comforts. Here are a few suggestions to help dads get their kids into <em>Across the Spider-Verse</em> (or perhaps catch up on all the Marvel and <em>Star Wars </em>shows they may have missed).</p>

<p>Last week, Sony published a seemingly innocuous round of interviews that centered the company’s nebulous “creative entertainment vision”. Neil Druckmann, head of the Sony-owned game studio Naughty Dog, was one of those — but his interview wasn’t quite what it seemed.</p>
<p>Druckmann, who headed the team behind <em>The Last of Us </em>series, was apparently wildly misquoted by his own employers. A few days after the interviews were published, he took to X and said, “This is not quite what I said.” He even posted a section of the original interview transcript, which was hugely different.</p>
<p>Sony has since pulled the interview and issued an apology on the old page, saying the article had significant errors and inaccuracies, encompassing “animation, writing, technology, AI and future projects.” So, if all that was inaccurate, what was accurate?</p>

## Instagram is expanding its anti-bullying features for teens

<p>Instagram is expanding two of its safety features in an effort to ramp up its bullying protections for teens. The company is changing how limiting and restricting work in its app to give teens ways to deal with potential bullies that it claims are less likely to lead to further retaliation.</p>
<p>With the changes, Instagram users will have the ability to “limit” their post interactions to “close friends” only. That means that users will only see comments, direct messages, tags and mentions from people on their close friends list. Other followers will still be able to interact with their posts, but those comments and messages won’t be visible to others.</p>

## The best E Ink tablets for 2024

<p>E-Ink tablets have intrigued me ever since they became available because I’m a longtime lover of pen and paper. I’ve had hundreds of paper notebooks over the years, serving as safe places for me to dump story ideas, to-do lists, meeting notes and everything in between. But at a certain point, I turned away from physical notebooks because it became easier to save all of those things digitally in various apps that were always available to me on my phone. E-Ink tablets seem to provide the best of both worlds: the tactile satisfaction of physical notebooks with many of the conveniences found in digital tools. These devices have come a long way in the past few years, and we’re just starting to see more color E-Ink tablets become more widely available. I tested out a number of different E Ink tablets to see how well they work, how convenient they really are and which are the best tablets using E Ink screens available today.</p>

## Amazon Prime customers in the US now get free GrubHub+ delivery

<p>Amazon is permanently offering free restaurant delivery via Grubhub+ as part of its Prime subscription, the company <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/amazon-prime-grubhub">announced</a>. If you live in the US and pay $139 per year for a Prime subscription, you'll pay no fee for eligible GrubHub orders over $12. You'll also see lower service fees, 5 percent credit back on pickup orders and exclusive offers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That works out to a value of $120 per year, according to Amazon. The retail giant had previously offered Prime clients a free one-year subscription to GrubHub+, but once it auto-renewed, you had to pay $129 per year on top of your Prime subscription. Now, it appears to be a permanent Prime inclusion.</p>

<p>Sometimes, having to open a link from within another app on mobile could be disruptive and take you away from the task you were trying to accomplish. Now an <a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2024/05/multi-tasking-with-minimized-custom-tabs.html">update for Chrome</a> could help keep you focused with the task at hand. When you click on a link within Gmail, for instance, and open a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-chrome-for-windows-is-finally-getting-native-arm-support-134832609.html">Chrome</a> tab within the app, you can tap on the chevron icon in the toolbar right next to the &quot;x&quot; or the close button to minimize the browser. That turns the open tab into a compact, floating picture-in-picture window that you can drag anywhere on the screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can keep it minimized while you use the original app, and the moment you're ready to look at its contents, you only have to tap the floating window to restore the tab to its original size. We were already able
