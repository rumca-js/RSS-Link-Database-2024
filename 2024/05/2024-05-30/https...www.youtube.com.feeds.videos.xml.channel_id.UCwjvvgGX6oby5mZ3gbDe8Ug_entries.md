Exclusive Live Report From Sean Lin:  Around 100,000 demonstrators gathered around the Legislative Yuan in Taipei, calling for the withdrawal of controversial legislative reform bills proposed by opposition parties. Chanting slogans such as "no discussion, no democracy," the demonstrators protested the ongoing second reading of the reform bills tabled by the Kuomintang (KMT) and Taiwan People's Party (TPP) to expand the Legislature's power to oversee the government.
The protestors demanded the bills be sent back to legislative committees for further review.
