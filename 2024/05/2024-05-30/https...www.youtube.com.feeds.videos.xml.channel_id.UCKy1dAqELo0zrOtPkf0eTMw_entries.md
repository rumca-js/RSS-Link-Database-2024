Capes reviewed by Dan Stapleton on PC. Also available on Xbox, PlayStation, and Switch.
Capes’ clever and challenging take on superhero-flavored turn-based tactical combat gives you all of the information you need to turn the tables on its villains. Watching the action figure-like characters combine their powers and supercharge their diverse ultimate abilities sells their teamwork well, and chasing optional objectives in each mission gives you a lot to think about to counter a wide range of enemy types. Stealth missions don’t work quite as well but they’re mostly optional, and the story, heroes, and villains are entertainingly written throughout the substantial campaign.

Watch this clip from The Bikeriders as Austin Butler makes his daring escape away from the authorities only to run out of gas outside of the city limits.

The Bikeriders follows the rise of a midwestern motorcycle club, the Vandals. Seen through the lives of its members, the club evolves over the course of a decade from a gathering place for local outsiders into a more sinister gang, threatening the original group’s unique way of life.

The Bikeriders is produced by Sarah Green, p.g.a., Brian Kavanaugh-Jones, p.g.a, Arnon Milchan.
