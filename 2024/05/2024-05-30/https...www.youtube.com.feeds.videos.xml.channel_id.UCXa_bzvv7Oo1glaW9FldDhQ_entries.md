On the surface, Wuthering Waves may seem like another free-to-play action RPG title in the vein of Genshin Impact. While some basic mechanics and systems are similar, Kuro Games' take on the genre offers sleeker action, a more post-apocalyptic vibe and an interesting take on creature collecting.

First, you must navigate the underwhelming first hours that inundate you with lore and information without presenting a compelling plot. The English voice acting is uneven in this regard, with some characters sounding monotone. It also doesn't help that the localization has some errors.

Nevertheless, the combat is a strong foundation, anchoring everything else in a commendable fashion, whether battling powerful bosses or experimenting with different Concerto Skills. If you can make it past the opening to the better parts of the story, then Wuthering Waves is a solid experience, albeit one that would still benefit from more time and content.
