Subsequently, the backlash ensued. </p><p><br /></p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Planet Fitness already lost $400 MILLION in market value in the last 5 days.<br /><br />I guess forcing women to share their locker rooms with hairy men was not the greatest business model.<br /><br />Keep this going. <
