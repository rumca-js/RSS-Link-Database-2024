In Amazon Prime’s hit series Fallout, one character in particular is INSANELY OP. The Ghoul is able to one-shot his opponents with INCREDIBLE accuracy, even in the dark. This seems a lot like something you can do in the Fallout games thanks to V.A.T.S, but you need a Pip-Boy to be able to do this, which the Ghoul does not have. Seems pretty sus to us!
