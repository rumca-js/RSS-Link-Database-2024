Sony has revealed a new PS5 feature that'll let players generate shareable links enabling others to quickly jump into their multiplayer games without needing to be PSN friends first.
</p><p>
Once the feature arrives - at some point in "the coming months", <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/05/01/introducing-a-new-way-to-invite-ps5-players-into-your-multiplayer-sessions/">according to Sony</a> - players will be able to create links either directly on their PlayStation 5 console or using the PlayStation App. The resulting link can then be shared as a simple URL or a scannable QR code via the social media or messaging platform of their choice.
</p><p>
Additionally, Sony is working on a Discord widget version of the link feature that, when posted into chat, will dynamically refresh to show the multiplayer session's status -

Lego Fortnite, the survival crafting experience found within Fortnite itself, is adding a huge new Star Wars mode this Friday, 3rd May. 
</p><p>
The permanent addition comes as part of a Star Wars celebration across all four of Epic Games' main Fortnite modes: battle royale, Lego Fortnite, Rocket Racing and Fortnite Festival. But it's the Lego experience which looks by far the most impressive. 
</p><p>
A fresh Star Wars-themed Lego World will become available within the Lego Fortnite mode that offers a Rebel Village for you to build up and grow using Star Wars parts and materials, and which features unique Star Wars characters.

</p><p>
Horizon Zero Dawn will be removed from PS Plus Extra on 21st May, according to the game's listing on the PlayStation Store, as first spotted by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/1chiwws/i_guess_hzd_is_leaving/">reddit</a> and verified by Eurogamer. 
</p><p>
Specifically, this is for the Horizon Zero Dawn: Complete Edition, which includes the game's Frozen Wilds expansion too.

Lego has revealed three new Sonic the Hedgehog sets coming this summer, including Super Sonic for the first time.
</p><p>
Super Sonic is the first new Lego Sonic minifigure since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-knuckles-shadow-and-rouge-teased-for-sonic-the-hedgehog-sets">Knuckles, Rogue and Shadow</a>, who were teased last October and are now all available in various sets.

</p><p>
As with the Sonic minifigure, Super Sonic comes with a speed sphere (in yellow, of course) to launch him at enemies and Badniks. This is as part of a set with <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-gb/product/super-sonic-vs-egg-drillster-76999">Dr Robotnik's Egg Drillster</a>, inspired by his iconic boss vehicle in Sonic the Hedgehog 2's Emerald Hill Zone.

Take-Two looks to be shutting Intercept Games, the studio behind Kerbal Space Program 2, as part of its recent layoff announcement. 
</p><p>
A <a href="https://assets.gnwcdn.com/take-two-warn-notice-2024.jpg">closure notice</a> affecting 70 workers in Seattle has been published by Take-Two. This is where Intercept Games, which Take-Two is the parent company of, is located. 
</p><p>
In addition, several posts from Intercept employees have started making the rounds on <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/1chdo9l/its_over/">social media and LinkedIn</a>, stating they have been laid off or are now looking for work.

TopSpin 2K25 players are furious at 2K as online server issues have hampered the game's single-player career mode since launch.
</p><p>
The tennis game, the first in the long-running series for 13 years, released last week to generally positive reviews, but its single-player career mode requires an online connection.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, multiple server issues mean the mode has been unplayable for some, while progress has been lost for others.

Remember a couple of years ago, when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/funko-taking-a-leaf-out-of-legos-playbook-with-new-aaa-games">Funko announced a collaboration with Jon Burton's 10.10 Games</a> to release new big budget video games? Well, the time has come to see exactly what this collaboration has produced, and it all looks  rather chaotic. 
</p><p>
The appropriately-named Funko Fusion is described as a co-op action "extravaganza" full of more brands than you can shake a stick at: Jurassic World, The Umbrella Academy, Battlestar Galactica and Nope. The Simon Pegg-fronted Hot Fuzz is even making a big-headed showing in the upcoming game, and that's far from all the properties players can expect to see on release. 
</p><p>
Don't believe me? Well, you can see for yourself in Funko Fusion's reveal trailer - which features more giant he
