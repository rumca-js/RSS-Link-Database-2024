<p>Snapchat will finally join most of its messaging app peers and allow users <a href="https://www.snapchat.com/plus">to edit</a> their chats. The feature, which will be rolling out “soon,” will initially be limited to Snapchat+ subscribers, the company said.</p>
<p>With the change, Snapchat users will have a five-minute window to rephrase their message, fix typos or otherwise edit their chats. Messages that have been edited will have a label indicating the text has been changed. The company didn’t say when the feature might be available to more of its users, but the company often brings sought after features to its subscription service first. Snap announced last week that Snapchat+, which costs $3.99 a month, had reached <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://investor.snap.com/news/news-details/2024/Snap-Inc.-Announces-First-Quarter-2024-Financial-Results/default.aspx"><ins>9 million</ins></a> subscribers.</p>

## A researcher is suing Meta for the right to ‘turn off’ Facebook’s news feed

<p>Facebook’s News Feed algorithm has long been at the center of debates about some of Meta’s biggest problems. It’s also been a near constant source of complaints from users. But, if a newly filed lawsuit is successful, Facebook users may be able to use the social network with a vastly different feed. The Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University <a href="https://knightcolumbia.org/content/new-lawsuit-seeks-to-wrestle-control-of-newsfeed-from-meta-for-facebook-users"><ins>is suing</ins></a> Meta on behalf of a researcher who wants to release a browser extension that would allow people to “effectively turn off” their algorithmic feeds.</p>
<p>The extension was created by Ethan Zuckerman, a researcher and professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. He argues that Facebook users would be better off with more control over their feeds. “The tool, called Unfollow Everything 2.0, would allow users to unfollow their friends, groups, and pages, and, in doing so, to eff

<p><em>Starfield</em>, the excellent Digipick puzzle game surrounded by 80 hours of sci-fi mediocrity, is getting a performance update on Xbox Series X that unlocks frame rates above 30 fps. <em>Starfield</em>'s May update adds the option to target 30 fps, 40 fps, 60 fps or an uncapped frame rate — for displays that support VRR running at 120hz. Displays without VRR will have the choice of 30 fps or 60 fps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The May update also includes the ability to prioritize visuals or performance at each frame rate target. Visuals mode means the game will do its best to maintain a high resolution and full detail in lighting, special effects and NPCs, while performance lowers the resolution and clarity of those same details. Of course, both modes adjust the game's base resolution alongside heavy on-screen action.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Block appears to be squarely in the government’s sights. Prosecutors from the Southern District of New York are reportedly probing extensive compliance lapses at the parent company of Square and Cash App. <em>NBC News</em> <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/personal-finance/prosecutors-examining-transactions-block-owner-cash-app-squarc-rcna147181">says</a> a former Block employee has handed over documents to federal authorities, painting a picture of how the company failed to gather required risk-assessment information from customers and subsequently processed illegal transactions.</p>
<p>The documents allegedly show that Block greenlit multiple crypto transactions involving known terrorist organizations. Furthermore, Square reportedly processed thousands of transfers involving nations under economic sanctions. “From the ground up, everything in the compliance section was flawed,” the whistleblower allegedly told <em>NBC News</em>. “It is led by people who should not be in c

<p>The bad news? It’s the beginning of the month, so rent is due. The good news? Sony just revealed the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/05/01/playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-may-ea-sports-fc-24-ghostrunner-2-tunic-destiny-2-lightfall/"><ins>PlayStation Plus games lineup for May</ins></a>, and there are some serious standouts. The lineup includes <em>Ghostrunner 2</em>, <em>Tunic</em>, <em>Destiny 2: Lightfall</em> and <em>EA Sports FC 24</em>. Most of these games are available for both PS4 and PS5, except <em>Ghostrunner 2</em> which is only for PS5 players.</p>

<p>For better or (mostly) worse, the only way to fully increase the storage of an Xbox Series X/S is to use a proprietary expansion card. Three and a half years into the consoles' lives, there remain only two official solutions: <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-permanently-drops-the-price-of-xbox-series-xs-storage-192456920.html">Seagate's Storage Expansion Card</a> and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/western-digitals-first-xbox-series-xs-storage-cards-start-at-80-171723507.html">WD Black C50</a>.

<p>One of the main reasons it has been difficult to recommend the $500 Quest 3 VR headset over the $200 Quest 2 is a lack of exclusive titles, as most games have to support both models. This means we haven’t really seen the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-quest-3-review-mixed-reality-vr-150009788.html">power of the Quest 3 yet</a>, but the tides are turning.

<p>Another day, another company tests Apple's resolve. This time, it's TikTok allegedly violating the company's rules for apps, with the video platform seemingly allowing some users to purchase its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-cameo-pay-custom-videos-085759889.html">coins</a> directly from its website. TikTok has apparently given some iOS users the option to &quot;Try recharging on tiktok.com to avoid in-app service fees&quot; — namely Apple's 30 percent commission on purchases.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://twitter.com/getdavenow/status/1785391788481786001">photos shared on X (formerly Twitter) by David Tesler</a>, co-founder of the app Sendit, TikTok is prompting users to save around 25 percent when purchasing coins (used to tip creators) thanks to lower third-party service fees. They can then use Apple Pay, PayPal or a credit or debit card to complete their transaction. It's unclear why only some users have access to this circumnavigation; one hypothesis is the f

<p>New graduates have a lot to manage: applying for jobs or further education, staying on top of their finances, keeping healthy and maybe even finding a more permanent place to live. Instead of a gift basket full of food they don’t eat, consider giving them a subscription to a service they’ll use regularly instead. Be it a new service that can make their lives easier, or footing the bill for something they already pay for, your new grad will thank you for the thoughtful yet practical gift. Here are some of the best subscription services to consider gifting to new graduates this year.</p>

<p>Webcams are essential components to desktop and laptop computers. Most new models have them, and manufacturers are starting to catch up to the remote-work trend by making sure that their latest machines have semi-decent cameras on them. But if you spend most of your time on video conferences, or you stream on YouTube or Twitch or video chat with friends and family often, it may be worthwhile to upgrade your camera. External webcams offer video quality and customizations that most built-in lenses do not, making them a good choice for anyone who needs to put their best face forward at all times. We’ve tested dozens of webcams over the years and continue to try out the latest models that come to market; these are our top picks, plus some advice on how to pick the best webcam for you.</p>

<p>PC gaming can be an expensive hobby, at least when it comes to hardware. You want the best CPU and graphics card you can afford and, if you’ve tried to buy one of the latter over the past few years, you know how pricey that can get. After you spent a ton on building or buying a new machine, you might find you don’t have much left over for accessories like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-gaming-headset-130006477.html">gaming headphones</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-gaming-keyboard-140019954.html">keyboards</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-gaming-mouse-140004638.html">mice</a> and more. But that doesn’t mean you have to settle for less.
