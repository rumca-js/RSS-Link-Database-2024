<p>Nature Materials, Published online: 01 May 2024; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41563-024-01889-x">doi:10.1038/s41563-024-01889-x</a></p>The emergence of chiral morphologies from achiral building blocks is not well understood. Deep learning-based interpretation provides representative models for the process of symmetry breaking and chiral development during the growth of gold nanoparticles.
