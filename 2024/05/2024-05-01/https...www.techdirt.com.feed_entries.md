For years and years, Congress has been pushing a parade of horrible “protect the children online” bills that seem to somehow get progressively worse each time. I’m not going through the entire list of them, because it’s virtually endless. One of the most frustrating things about those bills, and the pomp and circumstance around them, [&#8230;]

In a haste to do something about the growing threat of AI-fueled disinformation, harassment, and fraud, lawmakers risk introducing bills that ignore some fundamental facts about the technology. For California lawmakers in particular, this urgency is compounded by the fact that they preside over the world&#8217;s most prominent AI companies and are able to pass [&#8230;]

The Supreme Court has made it pretty clear that age verification laws for websites violate the First Amendment. It’s had a couple of shots at this and really seemed to indicate that such laws are unconstitutional because age verification would block First Amendment-protected content from people who should be allowed to see it. So, it [&#8230;]

The best response to speech you don&#8217;t like is more speech. It definitely isn&#8217;t whatever the hell happened here. And that not only includes the Seattle Police Department&#8217;s decision to go after the person being physically harassed by other protesters, but the actions of the protesters themselves, whose physical aggression somehow encouraged police officers to [&#8230;]

Donald Trump, who has demanded both that we “open up our libel laws” and that we “repeal Section 230,” was just protected from a defamation claim thanks to Section 230. How about that? One thing that many people forget (or deliberately ignore?) regarding Section 230 is that it not only protects “Big Tech” as some [&#8230;]

For several decades, major wireless carriers AT&#38;T, Verizon, and T-Mobile collected vast troves of sensitive user location and movement data, then sold access to any random nitwit with two nickels to rub together. The result was a parade of scandals wherein everybody from stalkers to law enforcement (or pretending to be law enforcement) abused the [&#8230;]

I talk quite a bit about video game preservation efforts for a couple of reasons. First, I&#8217;m just a huge gaming nerd and it is almost physically painful to think that the cultural output of this artform can be lost to history at the whim of publishers that have the ability to shutdown backend servers [&#8230;]
