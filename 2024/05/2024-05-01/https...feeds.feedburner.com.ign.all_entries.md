Digital Sun’s previous outings, The Mageseeker and Moonlighter, were both fun games, but Moonlighter delighted me not only with its quality, but also its unusual genre combination. In this, Cataclismo is shaping up to be quite the worthy successor. While Moonlighter was half classic Legend of Zelda and half shopkeep simulator, Cataclismo is half tower defense and half base-building real-time strategy (with base-building inspired by LEGO). It’s also loads of fun, based on the hours I’ve already spent playing it. If the studio nails the landing with the full release, I’ll be spending far more time in its eerily charming world.
