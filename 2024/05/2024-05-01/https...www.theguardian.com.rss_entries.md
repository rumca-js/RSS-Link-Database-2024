Its app store page is illustrated with shots of very Nintendo-esque on-screen controls, framing screenshots from Game Boy, Snes and Mega Drive games. The reviews are glowing: “I’ve been downloading tons of games I played when I was a kid, it’s so nostalgic!” “This has saved me so much money.” And yet neither Sega nor Nintendo has anything to do with the app, and until recently, software of this type was banned from Apple’s platforms.

Part coming-of-age story, part state-of-the-nation satire, it refracted 1970s Britain through the lens of a bisexual mixed-heritage teenager.</p><p>It seems fitting that his journey from the “miserable undead” of the London suburbs to self-realisation in the Big City has been reincarnated on stage since Karim (Dee Ahluwalia) is, after all, an aspiring actor, who stands on the brink of soap opera fame by the end. We follow his family life and parental adultery to sexual experiments with Charlie (Tommy Belshaw) and best friend, Jamila (Natasha Jayetileke). Adapted by Emma Rice along with Kureishi, it is a warm, ebullient production, lovable and cheeky, even if shorn of the edgier energy of the novel.</p><p>At the <a

Etero, played by Eka Chavleishvili, is a middle-aged single woman in a remote Georgian village who is out walking near a steep ravine, collecting blackberries for the cakes she likes to bake. She looks up, transfixed by the beauty of a blackbird – having been, we are perhaps invited to assume, only waiting for this moment to arrive – when she loses her footing and disappears from the frame; film-maker Elene Naveriani switches the viewpoint to something terrifying and vertiginous: straight down to a near death experience.</p><p>Etero sees her own corpse in a parallel universe of her own stricken imagining, but this heartstopping near-miss, together with the unwelcome new symptoms of what appear to be menopause,
