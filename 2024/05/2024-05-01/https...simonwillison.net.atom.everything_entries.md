I’m often frustrated at how thin the documentation around the prompt format required by an LLM can be.</p>

<p>Llama 3 turns out to be the best example I’ve seen yet of clear prompt format documentation. Every model needs documentation this good!

The iOS app seems nice, and provides free but heavily rate-limited access to Sonnet (the middle-sized Claude 3 model)—I ran two prompts just now and it told me I could have 3 more, resetting in five hours.</p>

<p>For $20/month you get access to Opus and 5x the capacity—which feels a little ungenerous to me.</p>

<p>The new $30/user/month team plan provides higher rate limits but is a minimum of five seats.

This is a neat little article by Andrew Stephens who calls for more people to participate in building and supporting nice things on the web.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The very best thing to keep the web partly alive is to maintain some content yourself - start a blog, join a forum and contribute to the conversation, even podcast if that is your thing. But that takes a lot of time and not everyone has the energy or the knowhow to create like this.</p>
<p>The second best thing to do is to show your support for pages you enjoy by being nice and making a slight effort.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Like, comment-on, share and encourage people who make things you like. If you have the time or energy, make your own things and put them online.
