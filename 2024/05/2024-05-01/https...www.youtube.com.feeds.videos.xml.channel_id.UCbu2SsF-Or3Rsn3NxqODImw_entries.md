After going hands-on with the new content in SMT V: Vengeance, the dark and twisted RPG is getting even sicker.

Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance adds a whole lot more than just quality-of-life improvements and a few gameplay additions. It's one thing to hear Atlus boast about how much it has changed SMT V for the new Nintendo Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC re-release, but having now played about two hours of a preview demo that focused on the new content, we've seen how Vengeance is building towards something much larger than the original game.
