Greedy monetisation, a lack of content, and glitchy online play plagued MultiVersus before now, but seeing as this new version has been rebuilt from the ground up, we\u2019re expecting big things. \n\nChanging perception, as already mentioned, is going to be tough, but given the promises we\u2019re hearing MultiVersus has a credible chance of a second birth.

From its early days in 2010 right up to now, the Metro games have consistently delivered excellently crafted, single player, narrative-driven experiences, which, unsurprisingly, has endeared the franchise to a great many people.

The facial expressions of Melina Juergens, reprising her role as Senua once more; the vocals and instrumentals; and the sheer gritty nature of the presentation remain unforgettable to this day.\n\nFast forward to this month, and the sequel is almost upon us, launching on May 21st for Xbox Series X/S and PC. As Senua ventures into Viking Iceland to seek revenge, Hellblade 2 makes significant strides in its visuals, story-telling, motion capture and combat. That's despite retailing for $49.99 and opting for a digital-only release.\n\nHow does it differ from (and improve on) Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice? Is the combat any different?
