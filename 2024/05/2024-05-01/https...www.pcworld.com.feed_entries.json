Not only do they allow you to stay anonymous, but they can help you get past region blocks on streaming services such as Netflix. However, you usually have to pay for a VPN subscription and adding an extra monthly expense to an already tight budget isn&rsquo;t ideal. That&rsquo;s where a free VPN can come in handy.
