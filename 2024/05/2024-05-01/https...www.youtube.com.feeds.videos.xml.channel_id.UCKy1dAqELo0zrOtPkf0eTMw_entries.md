There’s a live-action Scooby-Doo series in the works at Netflix. According to Variety, it’ll be an hour-long drama about Mystery Inc.. Things are still in the early stages of development, and plot details are a mystery of their own, but we do know that Josh Appelbaum and Scott Rosenberg are set to write for the series. And if you’re wondering who Josh Appelbaum and Scott Rosenberg are, they have some experience adapting another beloved cartoon about a group of misfits and their dog traveling around catching crooks… Netflix’s Cowboy Bebop.so might not give you too much hope in the series, given how poorly executed that particular adaptation was. That was the first, and probably the last live-action version of Cowboy Bebop for a while… Netflix was quick to announce there were no plans for a second season.

In today's Daily Fix:
Bethesda has released a fairly significant patch for Starfield, finally adding detailed maps to the game. There are also new options for ship decoration, new difficulty menu options, and the ability to play Starfield at 60fps on the Series X. Bethesda also teased the game's first major expansion, Shattered Space, which is coming this Fall. In other news, a new report has detailed when Xbox's biggest first-party games are coming this year, including offerings from Activision Blizzard, and Bethesda's Indiana Jones game. It looks to be a very busy second half of the year for Microsoft. And finally, the best selling game of the year so far is from Sony, but surprisingly not on the PS5...or the PS4. Helldivers 2, published by Sony, made a huge impact on the gaming scene, especially on PC, where it's done most of its sales.

Check out the Lee teaser trailer for the upcoming film starring Kate Winslet, Josh O’Connor, Andrea Riseborough, Andy Samberg, Alexander Skarsgård, and Marion Cotillard.

Lee, the directorial feature from award-winning Cinematographer Ellen Kuras, portrays a pivotal decade in the life of American war correspondent and photographer, Lee Miller (Kate Winslet).  Miller’s singular talent and unbridled tenacity resulted in some of the 20th century's most indelible images of war, including an iconic photo of Miller herself, posing defiantly in Hitler's private bathtub.  

Miller had a profound understanding and empathy for women and the voiceless victims of war. Her images display both the fragility and ferocity of the human experience. Above all, the film shows how Miller lived her life at full-throttle in pursuit of truth, for which she paid a huge personal price, forcing her to confront a traumatic and deeply buried secret from her childhood.

Lee is produced by Kate Solomon, Kate Winsle
