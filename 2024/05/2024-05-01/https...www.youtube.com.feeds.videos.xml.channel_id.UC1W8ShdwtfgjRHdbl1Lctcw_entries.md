I colorized, restored and created sound design for this video of New Orleans, Louisiana in the 1930s. You can clearly see what's happening in broad daylight Includes Downtown,  landscapes, Rural, African American people, often laboring, 

Video Restoration Process:
✔ FPS boosted to 60 frames per second 
✔ Image resolution boosted up to HD 
✔ Improved video sharpness and brightness 
✔ Colorized only for the ambiance (not historically accurate)
✔added sound design only for the ambiance
✔restoration:(stabilisation,denoise,cleand,deblur) 
✔ Face Restoration

Please, be aware that colorization colors are not real and fake, colorization was made only for the ambiance and do not represent real historical data.
