<p>Want to get rid of all the annoying ads and pop-ups you can? After a few tweaks, Windows will quiet down and stop bothering you so much when you’re trying to get work done. (Alas, Microsoft doesn’t make it possible to turn off <em>everything</em>, so don’t be surprised if you still see a few surprises even after following t

<p>No matter what type of Android phone you carry or how you usually use it, one thing is a near-universal constant:</p>



<p>You’re gonna spend a ton of time messing with messages.</p>



<p>The messages may be from clients, colleagues, or your cousin Crissy from Cleveland (damn it, Crissy!). But regardless of who sends ’em or what they’re about, they’re all popping up on your phone and cluttering your weary brainspace.</p>



<p>My fellow Android adorer, I’m here to tell you there’s a better way.</p>
