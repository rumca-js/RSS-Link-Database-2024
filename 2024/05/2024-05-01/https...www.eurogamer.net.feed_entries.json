Like a lot of people, I suspect, I discovered his books in my late teens and early 20s. I read The Music of Chance at school after I'd spotted it at the library and, of all things, found the cover intriguing. Later, at university, I had a lecturer who was a serious Auster fan and was foolish enough to lend me his signed copies of Leviathan and Moon Palace. I say foolish - I treated those books like holy objects while I had them in my house.</p><p>For a few years I read everything he wrote, going backwards mainly.
