There's hundreds of tutorials out there, but it's frustrating that they all assume you know what a Docker is, and how Caddy works. Komga's tutorials are also abysmal in that regard. From what I understand so far, all the other install options would be fine with the tutorials that are out (using Docker etc), however, I have used the Microsoft Store App to download and install my Komga.</p> <p>It is currently running locally, and it looks like I can access it remotely (it's worked once, and after a restart it's being buggy).</p> <p>However, the address is HTTP and not HTTPS, which it should be if I want to use it with Panels app (iOS). I've learnt that I should install Caddy to obtain this, however, I've no effin' clue how to install and make this work with my current Komga setup.</p> <p>Could someone please shed some light?</p> <p>Thanks in advance.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON", "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1chigvp/komga_server_how_the_hell", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/.rss", "source_obj__id": 450, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Komga server - how the hell?", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-05-01T09:58:53+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I'm interested in creating a historical timeline for my personal use (say for World War II).</p> <p>I was wondering if there's any way of creating this using self hosted software like a wiki (say bookstack) or through any other self-hosted tool.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Acceptable-Jump-8332\"> /u/Acceptable-Jump-8332 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1chib1w/has_anyone_created_a_timeline_using_selfhosted/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1chib1w/has_anyone_created_a_timeline_using_selfhosted/\">[comments]</a></span>", "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1chib1w/has_anyone_created_a_timeline_using_selfhosted", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/.rss", "source_obj__id": 450, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Has anyone created a timeline using self-hosted software?", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-05-01T09:31:48+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>i am not exactly new at self hosting, but i wanted to ask the community for advice and assistance.</p> <p>currently, i am using a few raspberry pi's to host my stuff, but i plan on changing them for zima blade's in the near future. as a part of this process, i want to clean up what i have running on my home network.</p> <p>as a result, i wanted to hear if there are alternatives to kodbox, that retain the &quot;multiple windows&quot; and almost desktop like environment it has. picture is kodbox as it currently is setup.</p> <p>when i first started up my synology nas, i loved how file station would allow me to open multiple windows, and browse the files. and i have been searching for similar stuff that can run on my raspberry pi ever since.</p> <p>i have tried filebrowser, but its a single window, not multiple.<br /> i have tried filestash, but again it's a single window.<br /> i have tried a few more that i cannot remember the names off, but all have t", "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1chhx12/kodbox_alternative", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/.rss", "source_obj__id": 450, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Kodbox alternative?", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-05-01T08:15:22+00:00", "description": "<table> <tr><td> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1chgt2n/my_homepage_dashbord_with_few_services_and_custom/\"> <img alt=\"My Homepage dashbord with few services and custom written API\" src=\"https://preview.redd.it/bcqtb2xcxrxc1.jpeg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=79665e03f9e2c87b3ce88da6f60f9b9681629cc2\" title=\"My Homepage dashbord with few services and custom written API\" /> </a> </td><td> <!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Made with Homepage running on docker container. </p> <p>Cusom REST API is written in Java.

How can I go about ding this?</p> <p>I have read something about it is how my Docker containers network settings are configured but I have not been able to find a guide or information on how to potentially correct this. Currently my containers are on the default Bridge network.</p> <p>For more information I have Cloudflare DNS pointing to my No-IP DDNS hostname which then points to my local Unraid installation/home IP address.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Man_of_Sloth\"> /u/Man_of_Sloth </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1ch8vvj/question_how_to_prevent_port_connection_with/\">[link]</a>", "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1ch8vvj/question_how_to_prevent_port_connection_with", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/.rss", "source_obj__id": 450, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Question: How to prevent port connection with NGINX on Docker", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-05-01T00:41:43+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I sort of get the overall distinction but in practice I'm struggling to think of a clear distinction.

I'd like to find a light-weight Windows installation, something that won't run updates and reboot of it's own accord, so that I can more easily get some of these servers. up and running. I've had a few windows VMs for this purpose in the past, but they all want to install everything, when I really don't need the vast bulk of the windows bloat/features. Is there a small/light-weight windows version out there? I know that something like this will never come from Microsoft, so I'm hoping that someone in the community who is smarter than me has already taken on this challenge.</p> <p>I will be running this in a VM on Unraid. I don't expect that would make any difference, but you never know. I have another system that has a full Linux install on it where I do some other hosting, but I feel like this VM would be simpler on Unraid.</p> <p>Thank you, in ad", "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1ch8oae/is_there_an_easylightweight_windows_for_game", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/.rss", "source_obj__id": 450, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Is there an easy/light-weight Windows for game server hosting?", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-05-01T00:19:33+00:00", "description": "<table> <tr><td> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1ch8cd1/my_dashboard_for_all_my_selhosted_servers_on_a/\"> <img alt=\"My dashboard for all my selhosted servers on a single Raspberry Pi 5\" src=\"https://preview.redd.it/eyj0f317kpxc1.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fc9948ac5dc0d35fb316f03cdffde8ff38c18053\" title=\"My dashboard for all my selhosted servers on a single Raspberry Pi 5\" /> </a> </td><td> &#32;
