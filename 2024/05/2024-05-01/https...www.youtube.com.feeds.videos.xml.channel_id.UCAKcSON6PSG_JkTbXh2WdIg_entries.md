The Kills — the rock duo comprising Jamie Hince and Alison Mosshart — released their sixth studio album, God Games, in October 2023. The album was produced by Paul Epworth at his home base, The Church Studios, in London. 

While in the Twin Cities for a show at First Avenue in Minneapolis, The Kills visited The Current studio to play stripped-down versions of songs from the latest album. Afterwords, Mosshart and Hince spoke with host Jill Riley about the making of the album — including the cross-country driving trips that inspired some of Mosshart’s song ideas.

Watch and listen to "Better Days" above.
