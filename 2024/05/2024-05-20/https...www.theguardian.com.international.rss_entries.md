<p>This remarkable documentary goes behind the scenes at a new major crime unit digging into dormant cases – and getting closure for brave survivors who’ve been waiting for decades</p><p>Cold Case Investigations: Solving Britain’s Sex Crimes initially appears to be yet another behind-the-scenes documentary about police work in the UK, along the lines of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/dec/17/24-hours-in-police-custody-review-channel-4">24 Hours in Police Custody</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jul/09/night-coppers-channel-4-review-documentary">Night Coppers</a>, The Met and so on.

<p>The upside-down flag at Samuel Alito’s house after the Capitol attack reveals how disgraceful our supreme court has become</p><p>These people can’t help themselves. Last week, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/16/us/justice-alito-upside-down-flag.html">New York Times</a> revealed that during the days after the violent attack on the Capitol on 6 January 2021, when the US supreme court was still considering whether to take up cases challenging Joe Biden’s election victory, the home of the supreme court justice Samuel Alito, in suburban Virginia, flew a pro-coup flag. The Times printed photos of the American flag flying upside-down on a pole in Alito’s front yard; by January 2021, the upside-down flag had become a well-known symbol of the so-called “Stop the Steal” movement, champions of Donald Trump who supported his legal and violent attempts to overthrow the 2020 election.</p><p>At the time, pro-Trump social media groups were encouraging supporters to fly their flags thi

When the Denver Nuggets bolted to a 20-point lead over the Minnesota Timberwolves halfway through the deciding game of the Western Conference semi-finals, it seemed as if the final chapter of this engrossing, hectic, epic series was written: the defending champions, stunned and humiliated in Games 1, 2 and 6, had risen off the canvas to deliver the decisive blow at the decisive moment. Then something happened. Anthony Edwards happened.</p><p>Edwards, the No 1 pick in the 2020 draft, has long been described as the future face of the NBA. At 22, he’s already the undisputed leader of the Timberwolves – an impressive achievement in itself, given he plays with another former No 1 draft pick (Karl-Anthony Towns), an all-time defensive great (Rudy Gobert), and a wily veteran guard (Mike Conley Jr).

<p>The Whiplash star commits himself to the role of rampage killer on a motorbike rampage that ultimately lacks forward momentum</p><p>Veteran actor JK Simmons (Whiplash) is the main reason to watch this basic horror-thriller, which isn’t as horrific or thrilling as one might hope. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/dec/10/jk-simmons-counterpart-whiplash-interview">Simmons</a> plays Wade, a cold-as-ice killer on a rampage, who kicks off the action by shooting some random people at a gas station. One of whom asks: “Why are you doing this?”; Wade’s response is: “Does it matter?” This could have stood up as an interesting moment of frank nihilistic confession on behalf of a movie genre that loves to invent motivations for maniacs when it probably doesn’t need to bother; most of these kinds of films are about the thrill of the chase, and nobody really cares why the killer is a killer.

A key player in the team that secured fourth place last term, the Swedish striker has flourished as one of several standout players for Eddie Howe in an often difficult campaign this time around, when injuries to key personnel and the lengthy ban handed down to Sandro Tonali meant many Newcastle players were running on fumes.

There was to be one last impromptu hurrah, however, when he was famously recalled seven years later to face England at Twickenham.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/arti
