None of my ports except Plex are exposed on the router and I am using Cloudflare Tunnel to &quot;expose&quot; the log in Unraid web page, Overseer and Immich for my family and friends through a purchased domain.</p> <p>My passwords for Unraid and Immich are fairly complex, and at least for Unraid I know there is bruteforce timeout. My understanding is Overseer should be fine, as anyone who connects to it needs to authorize with Plex and then will need to be given permission by me to request anything.</p> <p>How vulnerable is my server with this set-up, and how can I harden it? I'm wondering if MFA could be it, but it's a bit over my head, how to do it.</p> <p>I appreciate any and all input.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.redd

But the fact is that it's still too much of a pain in many areas.</p> <p>For example, if your ISP has locked you out in CGNAT hell, getting Caddy to work after generating a proper SSL certificate through Let's Encrypt or Zero SSL, is way too complex. Caddy has a DNS challenge module for those stuck with CGNAT, but it isn't integrated into the package and has to built from the source code.</p> <p>Even after getting it all to work, there's no guarantee that your preferred selfhosted software will actually work with reverse proxy (eg.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Years ago I first dipped my toe into selfhosting with an Odroid HC2 (+6TB HDD) as a tiny home server. It was well supported by OMV, so that's what I went with. Since then things have slowly (at first, but then quickly) escalated, and I've now got a 3-node Proxmox VE cluster running running on a couple of tiny PCs and a thin client (plus the trusty Odroid serving as a backup target). </p> <p>As time went on, I went from selfhosting only Plex and the *arrs to a more diverse mix - including Immich, Paperless, Home Assistant, etc. My storage needs grew too, and I've cobbled together 28TB of storage (excluding backup/boot disks) from an 18TB drive, the original 6TB drive, and a 4TB drive, all managed by OMV in a VM. I'm using the mergerfs plugin to create a single shared storage pool, but my current drive configuration has no parity (all the important stuff is backed up locally and to B2 cloud storage though). Oh, and all the drives have ended up connected

This way you can even more specify various information that are particularly of interest of a specific plant. Datatypes are text, number (integer and float), boolean values and dates. You will also be able to toggle what default attributes shall be shown in the plant details.</p> <p>Another great new feature is the REST API: You can now manage some plant data via the REST API by using your generated API keys. Imagine you have something like sensors that are capable of performing API requests. They could then live update plant data of a specific plant.</p> <p>Here is the changelog of the key features:</p> <ul> <li>Manage custom plant attributes</li> <li>REST API feature</li> <li>Radiobuttons
