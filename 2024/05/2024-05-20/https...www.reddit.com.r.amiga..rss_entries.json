They always had best graphics for their games. I remember playing this as a kid with my mates and we used to pick a team and play in the same league. This was old school mulitplayer before the internet. Everyone would share the same save and play their games when it was their turn to play and when we had to play each other we would meet up at someones house to play that game. There was no other choice, you had to use the same Amiga to play each other. Good times, did anyone else used to play these games with their friends? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/MarcusNarcous\"> /u/MarcusNarcous </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1cw4do5/tv_sports_basketball_and_football/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1cw4do5/tv_sports_basketball_and_football/\">[comments]</a", "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1cw4do5/tv_sports_basketball_and_football", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/.rss", "source_obj__id": 458, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "TV Sports Basketball and Football", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
