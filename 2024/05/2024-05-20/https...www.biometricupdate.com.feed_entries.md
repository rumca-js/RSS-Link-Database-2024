		Zambia has carried out a major first step in its transition towards a modern legal and digital identity system, by digitizing the records of roughly 7 million people. The milestone comes amid a series of engagements by African governments with identity systems at various stages of development with international development partners to strengthen their digital public infrastructure (DPI) and ID systems. Moves in Namibia and Tanzania, along with Zambia, have been revealed just as ID4Africa’s annual in-person event for 2024 kicks off, with a focus on DPI.

		Bermuda’s government will not be deploying facial recognition capabilities in its CCTV system, at least for now, due to unspecified “practical challenges,” the National Security Ministry announced last Thursday. The news comes as the Caribbean country’s public surveillance project, due to be completed by July 2024, comes under attack from rights advocates as well as political opposition.

Last week, the Bermuda Human Rights Commission questioned whether the use of the technology would be constitutional, warning that facial recognition could have “far-reaching and alarming” implications for privacy and human rights. The organization is currently working on examining the impacts of facial recognition on human rights in line with directives from the United Nations, says its e

		The evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of biometric systems are important but not necessarily easy to understand.

Evaluation itself is an increasingly necessary step for biometrics market participation. Continuous performance evaluation allows the operator to improve and optimize the biometric system over time. It helps identify weaknesses and areas for enhancement while meeting the regulatory requirements for security and privacy.
