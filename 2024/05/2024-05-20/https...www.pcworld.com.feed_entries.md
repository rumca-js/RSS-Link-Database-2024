<p>As you might have noticed, Microsoft and Qualcomm are pushing <em>hard </em>for Windows machines running on the latter&rsquo;s new Snapdragon chips. Pretty much every major laptop manufacturer just announced new Arm-based models coming this summer. And Intel, the reigning champ of PC chips, isn&rsquo;t taking this news lying down. PCWorld&rsquo;s Gordon Mah Ung breaks it down in our latest YouTube video. </p>



<p>In a back-and-forth that resembles a certain pair of pop vocalists with beef, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2337701/intel-claims-lunar-lake-will-outperform-qualcomms-new-x-elite.html">Intel scheduled an announcement that its new Lunar Lake series of chips will beat Snapdragon X</a> in several metrics, including the new NPU hotness, at exactly the same time as the new Arm-based laptops were announced.

<p>Microsoft launched its Surface Pro (2024) tablet and the Surface Laptop (2024) as part of a major coming-out party for both the Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite as well as Windows on Arm, part of Microsoft&rsquo;s evolution into an AI-centric company.</p>



<p>Both the Surface Pro and the Surface Laptop are the consumer versions of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2270470/microsofts-new-business-surfaces-actually-seem-truly-business-y.html">Surface Pro 10 for Business and the Surface Laptop 6 for Business</a>, which debuted in March.

<p>To date, PC vendors have shipped AI PCs. On Monday, Microsoft announced the next step in the AI PC&rsquo;s evolution, the Copilot+ PC, and announced AI-powered Windows 11 features like Recall.</p>



<p>&ldquo;The pursuit has always been about how to build computers that understand us, instead of having us having to understand computers, and I feel like we really are close to that breakthrough,&rdquo; said Satya Nadella, Microsoft&rsquo;s chief executive, in a briefing with reporters on Microsoft&rsquo;s campus. </p>



<p>A Copilot+ PC combines local, on-device AI with cloud AI, according to Microsoft, to provide a range of services. Some of the new laptops shipping with the Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite and X Plus processors will be classified as Copilot+ PCs, taking advantage of the NPU found within both chips. That NPU will power local AI functions, with over 4

<p>We&rsquo;ve seen Windows-based PCs built around Arm processors before, but this year <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2284554/qualcomm-says-snapdragon-x-elite-kicks-intel-core-ultras-butt-too.html">Microsoft and Qualcomm</a> are pushing for a new generation of more powerful, more efficient machines. And OEMs are onboard in spades. Acer&rsquo;s first new laptop running on the updated SoC designs will be the Swift 14 AI &mdash; and yes, &ldquo;AI&rdquo; in the name means it&rsquo;s packing a <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2199565/ai-reality-check-new-npus-dont-matter-as-much-as-youd-think.html">Neural Processing Unit (NPU)</a>. </p>

<p>Today marks a historic day for the Dell XPS 13: it&rsquo;s the first Dell XPS 13 notebook without an Intel chip inside. But no, it isn&rsquo;t an AMD Ryzen chip. Qualcomm&rsquo;s Snapdragon X Elite powers the new XPS 9345, instead.</p>



<p>And that&rsquo;s not all. The Dell Latitude 7455 uses the Snapdragon X Elite, and the slower, slightly less powerful Snapdragon X Plus will ship as part of the Latitude 7455, too, as well as the Latitude 5455, Inspiron 14 and Inspiron 14 Plus.</p>



<p>We knew that Dell had signed up to use the Snapdragon X Elite as early as last October, when <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2116395/qualcomms-latest-snapdragon-attracts-huge-pc-partnerships.html">nine PC makers committed to supporting Qualcomm&rsquo;s new X Elite</a> processor.

<p>Intel executives, in what was clearly an effort to distract from the launch of a number of PCs powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite, said that Lunar Lake is currently in production and is on track to ship in the third quarter.

<p>One of the coolest things about USB-C tech is its ability to output standard video, and combine it with charging and data for a single-cable solution when you plug your laptop into a monitor.

<p>In just the last few years, there&rsquo;s been an explosion of new laptops featuring OLED displays. Just like the phone market saw them become nearly ubiquitous, the laptop market is finding more and more models offering up OLED displays at nearly every price bracket save for some of the cheapest systems. And that highlights a crucial detail: OLEDs cost a premium over traditional LCD displays. So the big question, then, is whether an OLED display is worth the extra cash you&rsquo;ll have to spend to have it on your laptop.</p>



<p>Like most tech questions, the answer will come down to what you want to do with your laptop and what you&rsquo;re hoping to get out of it. So we&rsquo;ll need to dive into the perks of OLED and the drawbacks so you can properly weigh the value for your own circumstances.</p>
