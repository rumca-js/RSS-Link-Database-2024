On one hand, code is just a huge pile of rules\u2014rules that are endlessly applied by dutiful silicon gates without fear or favor, almost always without alpha particle-induced error. We want the transistors to follow these rules perfectly.</p><p>But there\u2019s another layer of rules that aren\u2019t so sacrosanct. Unlike the instructions we feed to machines, the rules we make for ourselves are highly bendable. Some are simply stylistic, others are designed to bring consistency to our unruly piles of code.
