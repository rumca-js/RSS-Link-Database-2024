Barely competent. eSports players won&rsquo;t take a second, super-fast glance at a new gaming monitor unless it&rsquo;s 300hz, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1665236/alienware-aw2524h-monitor-review.html">preferably 500hz and worth a mortgage payment</a>. But a new TCL panel might just blow every gaming monitor on the market out of the water. At the Display Week conference, the company showed off a 1000Hz LCD for the first time. </p>



<p>Details on the new display tech are sparse.

This makes it possible to find your way around any keyboard without affecting your typing speed. Keyboards with a nu
