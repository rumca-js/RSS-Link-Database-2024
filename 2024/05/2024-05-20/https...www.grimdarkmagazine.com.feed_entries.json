As with any good first instalment in an ambitiously epic fantasy series, A Memory of Song has a lot of moving pieces. Set in a bleak world that has lost its basic natural elements due to an ancient order of warlocks singing songs composed of blood magic, we follow two broken souls who are both on their own quest to seek vengeance and to protect their loved ones, no matter the cost. On the one hand, there\u2019s Wulfee, the fierce and fearsome leader of the sacred Feldarra clan who is hell-bent on getting revenge on her estranged husband after losing her sons. And on the other hand, we\u2019ve got James Culdaine, the displaced last heir to the Northern throne whose powers, legacy, and destiny are much grander than his ordinary name might have you believe.
