MultiVersus is getting new fighters: Agent Smith from The Matrix franchise, and Jason Voorhees from Friday the 13th. Never thought we'd see the day when Marvin the Martian and Jason Voorhees would go toe-to-toe, but here we are. And speaking of crazy crossovers, the rumors are true: Call of Duty is getting Gundam content later this month. It's not confirmed if you get to pilot a Gundam or what, but it's a pretty cool idea nonetheless.\n\n#IGN #Gaming #GhostOfTsushima", "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkm1W8Res5U", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "source_obj__id": 149, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/Gkm1W8Res5U/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Ghost of Tsushima Is Sony's Biggest Single-player PC Launch Yet - IGN Daily Fix", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-05-20T22:00:26+00:00", "description": "V Rising will be available on PS5 (PlayStation 5) on June 11, 2024, and it is already available on Steam.
