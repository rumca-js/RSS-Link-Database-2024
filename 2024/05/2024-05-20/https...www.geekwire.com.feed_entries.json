TechCrunch, which first reported on the layoffs, reported that 30% of SeekOut&#8217;s workforce was let go. The cuts were announced last week, according to LinkedIn posts from affected workers. We&#8217;ve reached out to the company for comment. SeekOut previously laid off 7% of its staff in October, and said it had about 200 employees at the time. Founded in 2017, SeekOut\u2019s software is used by more than 1,000 companies to help with recruiting.&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2024/recruiting-software-company-seekout-lays-off-employees-in-another-round-of-cuts/\">Read More</a>", "language": "en-US", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2024/recruiting-software-company-seekout-lays-off-employees-in-another-round-of-cuts", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed", "source_obj__id": 131, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Recruiting software company SeekOut lays off employees in another round of cuts", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-05-20T20:02:07+00:00", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"912\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/moto6-1260x912.jpeg\" width=\"1260\" /><br />New research suggests that using robots to address workers shortages in hospitality jobs such as food service and hotel work could create a negative feedback loop that makes the problem worse. A survey of 321 lodging and 308 food service employees in the U.S. found that the fear of robots replacing human workers increased their job insecurity and stress \u2014 which heightened intentions of resigning. The anxiety and likelihood of quitting was most pronounced among workers who had experience working with robotic technologies. The concerns applied to low-level employees and managers alike. \u201cThe turnover rate in the hospitality industry ranks&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2024/do-robots-harm-or-help-hospitality-labor-shortages-new-research-warns-of-worker-anxieties/\">Read More</a>", "language": "en-US", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2024/do-robots-harm-or-help-hospitality-labor-shortages-new-research-warns-of-worker-anxieties", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed", "source_obj__id": 131, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Do robots harm or help hospitality labor shortages?
