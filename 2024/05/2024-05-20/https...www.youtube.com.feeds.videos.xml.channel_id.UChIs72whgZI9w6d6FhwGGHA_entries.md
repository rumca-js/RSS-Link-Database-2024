Our case reviews are FULLY OPERATIONAL & BACK! We have now finalized our methodology with changes from our Hype and Fractal North XL reviews. Now, our new data set is used to review the Hyte Y70 Non-Touch case (the same as the Hyte Y70 Touch, but without the expensive screen). This follows our prior reviews of Hyte's Y60 -- which created a new case style -- and its Y40, which disappointed us. We're back now to see how its Y70 high-end gaming PC case does. Alternatives to the Hyte Y70 and Y60 include the Antec C8 ARGB (not out yet, but the C8 is), Lian Li O11D Evo and Evo XL, Corsair's 6500 series (review coming soon), and non-dual-chamber cases like the Fractal Torrent.

Watch our Fractal North XL review that kicked off the new testing! We've updated some tests since then, too! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQHKCjuYTVQ
