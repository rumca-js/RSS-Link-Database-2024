He told me that he felt that by my voicing the system, I could bridge the gap between tech companies and creatives and help consumers to feel comfortable with the seismic shift concerning humans and AI. He said he felt that my voice would be comforting to people. After much consideration and for personal reasons, I declined the offer.</p></blockquote><p class=\"cite\">&mdash; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bobbyallyn/status/1792679435701014908\">Scarlett Johansson</a>", "language": "en-us", "link": "https://simonwillison.net/2024/May/20/scarlett-johansson/#atom-everything", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://simonwillison.net/atom/everything", "source_obj__id": 423, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Quoting Scarlett Johansson", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-05-20T21:19:07+00:00", "description": "<p><a href=\"https://madebyevan.com/algos/crdt-text-buffer/\">CRDT: Text Buffer</a></p>\nDelightfully short and clear explanation of the CRDT approach to collaborative text editing by Evan Wallace (of Figma and esbuild fame), including a neat interactive demonstration of how the algorithm works even when the network connection between peers is temporarily paused.\n\n    <p>Via <a href=\"https://lobste.rs/s/42dxsn/crdt_text_buffer\">Lobste.rs</a></p>", "language": "en-us", "link": "https://simonwillison.net/2024/May/20/crdt-text-buffer/#atom-everything", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://simonwillison.net/atom/everything", "source_obj__id": 423, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "CRDT: Text Buffer", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
