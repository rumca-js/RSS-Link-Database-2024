When Assassin's Creed Shadows launches earlier this year, not only is it going to have to do justice to the long overdue promise of an Assassin's Creed game set in Japan, it's also going to have to meaningfully advance the series' lineage of action RPG titles in Origins and Odyssey - which, of course, means the open world behemoth is going to have high expectations to live up to in more ways than one.

How does it perform on our test hardware and how consistent does the performance remain across different test conditions? To that end, we present a comprehensive graphics analysis of Ghost of Tsushima on PC.
