<p>Slack has updated its “privacy principles” in response to concerns about the use of customer data to train its generative AI (genAI) models. </p>



<p>The company said in a <a href="https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/blog/news/how-slack-protects-your-data-when-using-machine-learning-and-ai" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">blog post</a> Friday that it does not rely on user data — such as Slack messages and files — to develop the <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/1627101/what-are-large-language-models-and-how-are-they-used-in-generative-ai.html">large language models</a> (LLMs) powering the genAI features in its collaboration app. But customers still need to opt out of the defaul

<p>There’s been a <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2089535/will-ai-end-apples-existential-crisis.html">change in tone</a> concerning what to expect from Apple’s forthcoming AI announcements at WWDC, so perhaps it’s time to moderate the hype.</p>



<p>What we’ve been hoping for is an impressive counterattack from the company, one designed to shrug off speculation the company is falling behind on AI. With thousands of engineers and billions of dollars focused on AI research and development, there’s been building expectations of something impressive from the company. However, if Apple industry bellwether <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-05-19/what-is-apple-doing-

<p>OpenAI last week <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2104578/openai-announces-new-multimodal-desktop-gpt-with-new-voice-and-vision-capabilities.html">demonstrated its GPT-4o multimodal AI model</a>, and Google followed a day later with a demonstration of its <a href="https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/project-astra/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Project Astra</a> (a set of features coming later to Google’s Gemini). Both initiatives use video input (along with audio) to prompt sophisticated, powerful and natural AI chatbot responses. </p>

<p>What’s the most important piece of productivity software in the business world? Some might say the office suite. But if you look at the time spent actually using software, the answer may well be the web browser. It’s where people do most of their fact-finding and research.</p>



<p>But that’s only a start. These days, web apps like Google Docs, Gmail, Salesforce, Jira, and countless others are accessed via the browser as well. And countless software makers that offer traditional apps that you install and run on the desktop, such as Trello, Asana, Slack, and Microsoft 365 apps like Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook, also have highly capable web-based versions of their apps that are more conve
