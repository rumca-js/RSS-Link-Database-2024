<p>We all know the thrill of bending the rules, or even breaking them. Maybe it’s going 56 in a 55-MPH zone, or letting the parking meter expire. Maybe it’s dividing two numbers without testing to see if the denominator is zero.</p><p>Programmers have a weird relationship with rules. On one hand, code is just a huge pile of rules—rules that are endlessly applied by dutiful silicon gates without fear or favor, almost always without alpha particle-induced error. We want the transistors to follow these rules perfectly.</p><p>But there’s another layer of rules that aren’t so sacrosanct. Unlike the instructions we feed to machines, the rules we make for ourselves are highly bendable. Some are simply stylistic, others are designed to bring consistency to our unruly piles of code. This set of rules applies to what we do, not how the machines respond.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3715414/10-more-bad-programming-habits-we-secretly-love.html#jump">To

<p>I once transitioned from a SaaS CTO role to become a business unit CIO at a Fortune 100 enterprise that aimed to bring startup development processes, technology, and culture into the organization. The executives recognized the importance of developing customer-facing applications, game-changing analytics capabilities, and more automated workflows.</p><p>Let’s just say my team and I did a lot of teaching on <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3237508/what-is-agile-methodology-modern-software-development-explained.html">agile development</a> and nimble architectures. But we also had a lot to learn about deploying highly reliable, performant, and secure applications to our data centers.

<p>Strap in, the AI revolution has hit overdrive!!!</p><p>Except, of course, that it hasn’t, and it won’t anytime soon, despite what you’ve read in countless breathless editorials. It’s not that AI isn’t important, or that it doesn’t have the potential to change everything. It is and it does, but it’s simply not going to happen as fast as we think.</p><p>The reason is people. It’s always people.</p><h2>The hubris of forecasts</h2>
<p><em>The Wall Street Journal</em> columnist Christopher Mims reminds us of this in <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/personal-tech/what-i-got-wrong-in-a-decade-of-predicting-the-future-of-tech-06420bba" rel="nofollow">his latest column</a>.
