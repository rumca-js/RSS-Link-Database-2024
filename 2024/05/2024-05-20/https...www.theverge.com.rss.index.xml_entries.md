  <p id="XNWnT3">Microsoft has just announced a new Surface Pro, which is part of the new wave of Copilot Plus PCs. The new Pro, which is technically the “11th edition,” starts at $999, comes in four colors, and is powered by Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon X processors. The base model comes with a 13-inch LCD screen, but you can upgrade to an OLED in some of the higher-end models. The chip is the star of the show here: it’s what enables a lot of the AI features Microsoft touted onstage, what makes possible the 14-hour battery life Microsoft promises, and more.</p>

  <p id="nCN8Aw">On Monday, Dell announced that it’s releasing five Qualcomm-configured laptops: the XPS 13 (9345), Inspiron 14, Inspiron 14 Plus, Latitude 7455, and Latitude 5455. That’s more than any other manufacturer has announced so far.</p>
<p id="N7qiPq">The new XPS 13 is powered by a midrange 12-core Snapdragon X Elite processor with Dual Core Boost. (There will also be a 10-core X Plus version but only available in China.) The company says it will support up to 64GB of memory, up to 2TB of PCIe SSD storage (with a 4TB option post-launch), and three 13.4-inch display options: a 500-nit 1920 x 1200 non-

  <p id="7W82hK">Buying a laptop from a major maker like HP can be infuriating — mainly because there are too many options. HP and other laptop makers do this to give us all “choice,” but if you are the kind of person who uses “RAM” and “storage” interchangeably, those choices can be confounding — which might be one reason HP’s using today’s big AI and Windows on Arm moment to also clean up its whole lineup. </p>
<p id="8evmRJ">Gone are the Envys and Pavilions and Dragonflies, and in their places are the consumer-focused OmniBook and the corporate-oriented EliteBook and ProBook. In both cases, the idea is to simplify thi
