<p><strong>Theatre Royal Plymouth<br /></strong>Drew McOnie’s version of the Oscar-winner is a visual treat, with expressive physical movement, lustrous dance routines – and an irrepressibly waggy puppet dog</p><p>Lightning has struck twice for Michel Hazanavicius’s irresistible 2011 <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/dec/22/the-artist-film-review">homage to Hollywood silent cinema</a>. The Oscar winner is now reframed as an effervescent and delightfully inventive stage show, which anticipates a longer life after a short run in Plymouth. Directed, choreographed and co-adapted by Drew McOnie, it retains the old-school charm and wit but goes beyond a retread, makes unexpected additions and more emphatically celebrates the transition to the talkies.</p><p>McOnie combines theatre and prerecorded film throughout a production that unfolds within set designer Christopher Oram’s glowing art deco proscenium arch and has a superbly integrated video design by Ash J Woodward.

<p><strong>Cannes film festival</strong> <br />Elaborate necrophiliac meditation on loss and longing stars Vincent Cassel as an oncologist who has founded a restaurant with a hi-tech cemetery attached</p><p>David Cronenberg’s new film is a contorted sphinx without a secret, an eroticised necrophiliac meditation on grief, longing and loss that returns this director to his now very familiar Ballardian fetishes. It’s intriguing and exhausting: a quasi-murder mystery and doppelganger sex drama combined with a sci-fi conspiracy thriller which comes very close to participating in that very xenophobia it purports to satirise. And among its exasperating plot convolutions, there is a centrally important oncologist who was having a possible affair with the hero’s dead wife and who had also been her first sexual partner as a teenager – but who never appears on camera.</p><p>Yet for all this, the film has its own creepy, enveloping mausoleum atmosphere of disquiet, helped by the jarring electroni

<p>Former US Open champion has decided against pursuing qualification for Roland Garros with the priority protecting her long-term fitness</p><p>For a few fleeting moments at the beginning of the clay court season, Emma Raducanu provided a firm reminder of the talent at her grasp. As Great Britain upset France on their own favoured surface, Raducanu played a starring role with two strong wins. Even more impressive than the victories was the level she exhibited throughout, which was some of the best tennis she has ever played. Two and a half years on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/sep/11/emma-raducanu-makes-tennis-history-with-us-open-final-win">from her US Open triumph</a>, this was meaningful progress to build on.</p><p>After her opening win there over Caroline Garcia, a former world No 4, Raducanu made an interesting statement.

<p>Juergens had never acted before she played the fearsome but troubled Senua in Ninja Theory’s game – and won a Bafta for it. Now she’s back to battle the character’s demons in a sequel</p><p>‘I hope people can relate to Senua,” says actor Melina Juergens, who plays the lead character in Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II, the newest game from British developer Ninja Theory. “I hope people play it and feel what somebody goes through on a daily basis who suffers from mental health issues – particularly psychosis. [They] come away with an understanding of it, able to empathise with people more.”</p><p>Juergens did not expect to be playing this role for the second time. In fact, she never expected to play it the first time. She was a video editor at the independent games studio when the first Hellblade game, Senua’s Sacrifice, was gestating in 2012. “They were looking for an actress, but in the meantime they asked me to step in to help out with [performance capture] tech experiments,” she tells

<p>What is plaguing our politicians? Disappointment, a culture of silence – and the fallout from Brexit</p><ul><li>Jennifer Nadel is co-director of Compassion in Politics</li></ul><p>When Conservative MP Elliot Colburn told parliament he’d attempted to take his own life earlier this year, he was amazed at the response he got. Politicians from across the house commended his courage, the Commons applauded him, Keir Starmer shook his hand and Rishi Sunak gave him a hug. However, more surprising was what happened afterwards. Eight members of parliament approached him to say that they, too, had reached that same place of despair. None of them, as far as Colburn knows, have spoken publicly about their experience.</p><p>It takes courage for any of us to speak publicly about our mental health, but for politicians there are added considerations. Our political culture comes with unrealistic expectations – that they should be unswervingly strong, independent, omniscient, and never faltering. Any

This is typical MacKay – charming, discreet, and more than a little concerned about giving others the wrong idea.</p><p>On screen, MacKay frequently plays characters who are suffocated by the codes of traditional masculinity, and turned cruel by them, too.

On Tuesday in particular, this severe weather risk may extend from Oklahoma all the way up to the Great Lakes.</p><p>This setup of low pressure could lead not just to a large outbreak of severe weather across the US later this week, but also to a sharp temperature gradient across the US and Canada as the warm air is fed into high

<p>Fears of a future tax rise have already increased fees and lowered intake. Use the money for bursaries and everyone wins</p><p>Labour may be gaining a reputation for policy shyness, but one of its ideas is already having an impact. The party’s plan to introduce a 20% VAT tax on private schools to better fund state education seems to have spooked the sector, which has <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/uk-private-schools-fees-increase-rise-7qpwrpqgb">increased fees</a> by 8% this year. Meanwhile, the Independent Schools Council has reportedthat admissions this past year <a href="https://www.isc.co.uk/media/wqtlaw5y/isc_census_2024_15may24.pdf">have fallen 2.7%</a>, and earlier this year <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/8867cf98-9c8f-48de-b8fa-2a4ed8002132">the FT reported</a> that private schools are aggressively recruiting wealthy international students in anticipation of Labour’s proposals.</p><p>Why is that important?

<p>A new docuseries traces the highs and lows of the Memphis record label, soaring with major acts like Otis Redding and Isaac Hayes but a victim of both capitalism and racism</p><p>During its breakout phase in the mid-1960s, Stax Records seemed to be soaring. The small company from Memphis managed to score huge, international hits with the new stars it introduced, like Booker T &amp; the MGs (Green Onions), Otis Redding (I’ve Been Loving You Too Long), and Sam &amp; Dave (Hold On, I’m Coming). Just one year later, however, the label teetered on the edge of collapse. “Stax had to come back from the dead,” said Jamila Wignot, who has directed a new, four-hour documentary on the legendary company titled Stax: Soulsville USA. “In that way, it became more than a record label. It became a beacon of hope.”</p><p>Unfortunately, the label needed that hope as much, if not more, than the millions of fans who came to its music for inspiration. In its classic years, between 1962 and 1975, Stax wa

The hotel’s restaurant, <a href="https://www.margaret-hotelchouleur.com/en/restaurants/restaurant-nimes/">Rouge</a>, run by Benin-born chef Georgiana Viou, recently won its first Michelin star. But the hotel itself, the <a href="https://www.margaret-hotelchouleur.com/en">Margaret Chouleur</a>, has been downgraded from a five-star to just four.</p><p>Here’s the interesting thing: it was the hotel that did the downgrading.

With the Côte d’Azur to its east and arty, chic Arles its nearest neighbour, Nîmes flies just below many tourists’ radar and sits firmly in the good-value category.<br /><

<p>A group that began as 23 Black fathers from London on WhatsApp is now a worldwide digital space where 40,000 men discuss being Black and a parent</p><p>Dope Black Dads was formed by Marvyn Harrison on Father’s Day 2018, initially as a WhatsApp group of 23 Black fathers he knew in London. It has since developed as a digital safe space for some 40,000 fathers from the international community to discuss their experiences of being Black, being a parent and masculinity in the modern world.</p><p>The group brings together men who are navigating fatherhood, societal pressures and the age-old stereotype of the absent Black father. Far too often societal biases perpetuate the myth of absent or disengaged Black fathers. The photographer sees this portrait series as an opportunity to uplift the ideology of Black men, especially in their role as fathers. The work is a celebration of joy, pride and love, and a tribute to the strength, resilience and beauty of Black families, amplifying their vo

<p>When our new motorhome broke down in France we felt unsafe and were stranded for five days</p><p><strong>When I retired from work last year, my wife and I set off on a road trip to France in our new motorhome. Two weeks into our trip, the engine failed on a campsite. We’d bought a £284 breakdown policy with the RAC, including European cover, and a recovery vehicle arrived promptly. The mechanic was unable to fix the problem, so we were told it would be towed to a dealership. However, the recovery truck was not long enough to carry the vehicle and, after trying to manoeuvre it off the campsite, the driver left it blocking a lane. A larger truck was eventually sent and, since it was getting late, the motorhome was moved to a storage depot for the night.</strong></p><p><strong>The site, shared with a breaker’s yard, was unstaffed and we were advised by the driver to stay with the vehicle for security reasons.

Well, it seemed like “older” then. I had never particularly wanted kids. I didn’t <em>not</em> want them, either. I was just agnostic about it. Which was a good thing because my husband had been married and divorced twice, and already had three adult children. For the record, I had nothing to do with either divorce so the tension between me and his children that was evident even before our wedding had nothing to do with that.</p><p>I’ll be honest. I found them intimidating. For a start, there were three of them and one of me. So I did what I usually do when I feel overwhelmed: I tried too hard.

An eccentric man known locally in Glasgow as Arthur Knight woke up from a Covid coma in 2021 and found himself surrounded by police. US authorities claimed his real identity was Nicholas Rossi who, after several rape charges, faked his own death. This four-parter follows the countless shocking reveals as, over two years in court, he and his English wife, Miranda, continued to insist he was Knight. It also speaks with journalists, legal figures involved and the women Rossi allegedly assaulted. The case led to a judge ruling that he is, in fact, Rossi, and he is now facing charges in the US – but the journey needs to be seen to be believed. <strong>Hollie Richardson</strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/article/2
