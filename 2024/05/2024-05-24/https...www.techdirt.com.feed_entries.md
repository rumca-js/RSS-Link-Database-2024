Another day, another dumb lawsuit against TikTok. We’ve seen school districts and parents suing TikTok on the basis of extremely weird claims of “kids used TikTok, some bad stuff happened to kids, TikTok should be liable.” But in the past year, it seems that a bunch of state AGs have decided to sue TikTok as [&#8230;]

None of this makes sense. At least, not when you attempt to reconcile what&#8217;s being said with the university&#8217;s actions. It makes more sense later. But we&#8217;ll get to that in a moment. A non-profit called the Atlanta Police Foundation, which claims to be interested in building a better relationship between Atlanta&#8217;s police and the [&#8230;]

Public libraries are supposed to be places for communities to gather and learn, with an important focus on being a place for kids to gain access to information. But thanks to a moral panic in the GOP about “indoctrination” in libraries, it seems that at least one library has decided to shut its door to [&#8230;]

Discovery made to simply &#8220;retire&#8221; a bunch of games it published, mostly from small indie studios, from the various online stores where they were sold, such as Steam.
