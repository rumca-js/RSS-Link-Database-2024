<p>Classes and objects in Java must be initialized before they are used. You've <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2979739/java-101-classes-and-objects-in-java.html">previously learned</a> that class fields are initialized to default values when classes are loaded, and that objects are initialized via constructors—but there is still more to initialization. This tutorial introduces all of Java's features for initializing classes and objects.</p><h2>What you'll learn in this Java tutorial</h2>

<li>How to initialize a Java class</li>

<p>Classes, fields, methods, constructors, and objects are the building blocks of object-based Java applications. This Java tutorial teaches you how to declare classes, describe attributes via fields, describe behaviors via methods, initialize objects via constructors, and instantiate objects from classes and access their members. You'll also learn about setters and getters, method overloading, and setting access levels for fields, constructors, and methods.</p><h2>What you'll learn in this Java tutorial</h2>

What frustrates me about this industry is the lack of nuance. People make everything seem like drastic shifts.</p><p>The last example of this was <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3709050/what-happened-to-edge-computing.html">edge computing</a>. Many articles I read claimed that “the shift is to the edge.” That caused a lot of confusion. Reporters, clients, and students all reached out to ask if the cloud was dead since edge computing now seemed like the way to go.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3715290/the-cloud-repatriation-tempest-in-a-teacup.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>
