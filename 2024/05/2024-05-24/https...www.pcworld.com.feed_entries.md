<p>USB Type-C is the most flexible connection for notebooks and smartphones. The most important of its many capabilities is as a charging socket for battery-powered devices. USB-C <em>should</em> finally make everything simple: One socket, one cable, one power supply for all devices &ndash; from computers to smartphones and tablets to headphones and other peripherals.</p>



<p>So much for the theory, which always sounds simple with USB. The reality is more confusing.</p>



<p>Not every USB-C power supply is suitable for every device. Not all Type-C ports can be used to charge devices quickly or at all. And not every Type-C cable ensures reliable power transmission. </p>

<p>At its Build 2024 conference, Microsoft unveiled a new AI trick for Windows PCs&mdash;one that can help users locate or remember details from their digital past. It could be looking for a PDF file worked on a couple of weeks ago. Or perhaps finding the name of a restaurant recommended by a friend earlier this year. Called Microsoft Recall, this feature could save you many lost minutes trying to hunt down whatever&rsquo;s eluding your memory.</p>



<p>Yet even before its launch, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2338891/windows-recall-could-solve-my-biggest-problem-in-tech.html">Microsoft Recall</a> is already giving security experts indigestion. Underneath the futuristic shine, Recall comes with a potential massive hit to user privacy&mdash;and by extension, security.&nbsp;</p>

<p>About a year ago, we got the opportunity to <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1665236/alienware-aw2524h-monitor-review.html">review the Alienware AW2524H</a>, the first-ever gaming monitor with a blistering 500Hz refresh rate. One of the main reasons why we gave this monitor 4 out of 5 stars was its price, which, at the time, was $830.</p>

<p>In Windows, an admin account has full access and control over your entire operating system, which is exactly what hackers hope for when sending malware out into the world. If you&rsquo;re on a Windows account that&rsquo;s allowed to install programs, then malicious apps will have an easier time taking root in your PC.</p>



<p>And so, for years, the going advice has been to avoid a Windows administrator account for day-to-day use, since funny business could happen unbeknownst to you in the background.</p>



<p>But this advice could soon become obsolete.</p>

Cortana, Tips, and Wordpad are perhaps the most well-known victims of this cleanup.</p>



<p>Microsoft said about Cortana:</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a major appeal to gaming laptops: they give you the portability and power to play games wherever it is that you go. But if you&rsquo;re on a tight budget, it might be hard to find one that really fits the bill. The simple fact is, for $500, it&rsquo;s unlikely you&rsquo;re going to find a good gaming laptop with <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/619258/what-the-heck-is-a-discrete-graphics-card-anyway.html"><u>discrete graphics</u></a> unless you get lucky with someone selling a second-hand system (something you should absolutely pursue if you have a friend or relative who updates often). </p>



<p>That said, you&rsquo;re not going to be left out in the cold entirely. Let&rsquo;s get into what you can expect for $500, and what options you have to still access games on the go.</p>
