  <p id="QaC438">Tesla’s greenhouse gas emissions grew by nearly 10 million metric tons of CO2 last year, according to the company’s latest <a href="https://www.tesla.com/impact">impact report</a>, which provides the most revealing look yet of how the company is thinking about climate-related risks and its own carbon footprint.</p>

  <p id="dyPhkh">Getting a smart ring is a little more complicated than getting a smartwatch. To buy one, you need to acquire a sizing kit, try on a bunch of sample rings, find your size, wear it for 24 hours, make sure it fits properly, let the company know your size, and <em>then</em>, you get your smart ring. At least, that’s how it usually works.

  <p id="kjarQu">The face of one of the defining memes of the 2010s, the doge meme, died on Friday. Kabosu, the shiba inu with the knowing face that launched a million internet jokes, was 18 when she died, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kabosumama/p/C7V8AGvJPm9/">her owner posted on Instagram</a>.</p>
<p id="L9SAdN">Kabosu’s life story feels like an unlikely fairy tale for the internet age. In 2008, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/12/31/5248762/doge-meme-rescue-dog-wow">she was a rescue dog adopted by Atsuko Sato</a>, a kindergarten teacher.

  <p id="h7ZhL0">Did you think Sky, the new and newly personable voice of ChatGPT, sounded like Samantha from <em>Her? </em>Not everyone did, but enough people noticed <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/20/24160621/openai-chatgpt-gpt4o-sky-scarlett-johansson-voice-assistant-her">a distinct Scarlett Johansson...ness</a> in the chatbot that it became a story.

  <p id="PeR6Wb">You would think that a sci-fi movie where Jennifer Lopez partners with a smart-ass, sentient mech suit to fight against her evil AI brother would be a little more fun. Alas, <em>Atlas</em> — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24137589/netflix-atlas-trailer-jennifer-lopez-simu-liu">Netflix’s latest attempt at a hit streaming action movie</a> — takes itself far too seriously.
