The &quot;AI Projects&quot; I was working on were poorly motivated and driven by this panic that as long as it had &quot;AI&quot; in it, it would be great. This myopia is NOT something driven by a user need. It is a stone cold panic that they are getting left behind.<br /><br />The vision is that there will be a Tony Stark like Jarvis assistant in your phone that locks you into their ecosystem so hard that you&#x27;ll never leave. That vision is pure catnip.
