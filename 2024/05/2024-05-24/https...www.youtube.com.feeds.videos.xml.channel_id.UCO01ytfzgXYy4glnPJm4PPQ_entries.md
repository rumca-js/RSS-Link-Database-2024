Today on the Matt Walsh Show, we haven't talked much about the Trump trial in New York, mostly because the whole thing is a ridiculous farce. But, at this point, it has backfired so magnificently on the Democrats that it's worth taking a few moments to review just how bad it's gotten for them. Also, tragedy strikes as Media Matters suffers massive layoffs. Leftists in media declare that Caitlin Clark benefits from "white privilege" in basketball. And, a man on Wheel of Fortune last night makes the worst mistake in the history of game shows.
