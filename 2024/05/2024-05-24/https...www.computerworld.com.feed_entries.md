Soon, anytime you search for something within Google, whether on your phone or on a computer and whether at the office or on the go, you’ll <a href="https://blog.google/products/search/generative-ai-google-search-may-2024/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">get AI-powered answers</a> in place of the familiar blue links.</p>
