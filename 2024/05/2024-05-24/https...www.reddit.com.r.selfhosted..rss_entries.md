<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So, been running a Homelab gig for a short while now. I have a Desktop PC running Proxmox VE, which itself is hosting Docker LXC. As of now I only have Calibre, Emby and Paperless-NGX.</p> <p>My internet is via my own Cable Modem a Netgear CM1000v2 with 1gbps download / 100mbps upload. And my router/DHCP is a Synology RT2600AC Router, before all this Homelabbing I started with a Synology NAS DS218, which is still online.</p> <p>Via my Synology RT2600AC Router and Synology Account I have a DNS (xxx.synology.me) set up in the router. Earlier this week I set up the port forwarding for my Calibre, Emby and Paperless-NGX.</p> <p><a href="http://xxx.synology.me:0000/yyy">http://xxx.synology.me:0000/yyy</a></p> <p>And I was able to access my containers from my phone without any undue issues. Quite frankly I loved it. However I have heard so many different stories of the dangers of port forwarding. And wanted to know if I am doing something wrong or right.</p

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi, I'm looking for Advice on a self hosted private chat for role-playing. We're about 10 users but us 10 users will have 5-10 additional accounts (profiles) for roleplaying. We had Rocketchat and it worked great but it was hosted on owncube and all we paid was $10 a month for it and that hosting shut down. We've checked out other alternatives but the other issue as I said is that we will have multiple profiles. and apps we've tried like Slack, or mattermost etc just give us a tool to invite people. In Rocketchat we could just go to members, add a new user and they'd have their user and password for their new character/profile. IS there any chat service out there that can allow me to create accounts for people directly from the control panel or something? We had XenForo and we could do that too before we had rocketchat but that's a forum and we want to have a chat. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi,</p> <p>After having gotten my videos organized in Jellyfin and being pretty happy with it, I started to look into something equivalent for my music collection. I tried Jellyfin, and it looks awesome - but there's a catch. I have quite a few albums, but also a sizable collection of individual tracks from back in the day when connections were metered or bandwidth was too precious to download 10 extra songs for the two you actually liked...</p> <p>As far as I can tell, Jellyfin expects music to come as a full album, which of course helps with getting metatdata from the internet as well. I have my individual tracks in folders by first letter (like Music/Non-Album/A), and I think Jellyfin treats each of those folders as a giant album. That is not ideal.</p> <p>I could of course put each track in its own folder, and Jellyfin would probably play nicer with it, but then I'd have tons of albums with 90% of the tracks missing, which my OCD won't accept.</p>

Sermon Notes is a self-hosted note taking tool for people to use during church. I started taking an iPad to church for notes about 2 years ago and while it was nice, I couldn’t quite find an app to do what I wanted it to so I built my own. I wanted something that could take markdown notes and have reference material easily viewable. I started with Berean Journel as an app, but it requires internet and only offered Bible passages. My pastor frequently uses confessional documents since we are Dutch Reformed and so I needed more than just the Bible to follow the sermon. I built Sermon Notes to allow for multiple reference types. There is a docker container available if you care to try it out. I know this also requires internet, but I was hoping to eventually remove that limitation.</p> <p><a href="https://gitea.rkprather
