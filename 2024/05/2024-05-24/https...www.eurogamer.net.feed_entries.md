Skull and Bones - Ubisoft's extraordinarily long in the works (and not particularly good) open-world pirate adventure - is getting a free week-long trial next week, and it'll coincide with the launch of the live-service game's second season of post-launch content.
</p><p>
When Skull and Bones released in February - some 11 years after its troubled development started - Ubisoft trumpeted "record player engagement", but did not share sales figures. It's unclear just how well the pirate game has done for the publisher, then, but Ubisoft evidently believes it needs a bit of a boost given its <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/skull-and-bones/free-weekend">impending week-long trial</a>.
</p><p>
That'll take place across all platforms - Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5 and PC (via Epic and Ubisoft Connect) - from Thursday, 30

Epic has announced it's bringing Fortnite back to iOS devices in the UK at some point "in the second half of 2025" - and launching its Epic Games Store on the platform at the same time - as the UK's Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act passes into law.
</p><p>
The new <a href="https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3453/publications">Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act</a> gives the UK's Competition and Markets Authority - the regulatory body that made headlines when it initially blocked Microsoft's proposed acquisition of Activision Blizzard - new powers to prevent tech giants from using their position to disadvantage competitors and consumers.

A new entry in Sony's beloved Astro Bot series is reportedly in development and set to be officially unveiled very soon.
</p><p>
That's according to extremely reliable PlayStation leaker Billbil-kun, <a href="https://www-dealabs-com.translate.goog/magazine/astro-un-nouveau-jeu-est-bien-en-cours-de-preparation-decouvrez-tout-ce-que-lon-sait-a-ce-propos-51489">writing for Dealabs</a>. Word of a new Astro Bot game first surfaced earlier this year via journalist and prolific leaker Jeff Grub, but Billbil-kun says the project - in development at Astro Bot studio Team Asobi - is set to be formally unveiled within the next two weeks.

Details are limited but it's claimed the new Astro Bot - likely be called exactly that - is partly set in a desert environment and will feature a robot character resembling a

## Can Xbox Series S handle Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2?

Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 is one of the most visually stunning games of the year. Built on Epic's Unreal Engine 5, the game takes place in an incredibly detailed and strikingly lit world, featuring outstanding character rendering. At least that's how the game fares on Xbox Series X, so the question is how lower-specced hardware can handle this rendering juggernaut. We decided to take a look at how well Hellblade 2 runs on Xbox Series S, which has a fraction of the GPU compute of its larger sibling, followed by Valve's Steam Deck and the Asus ROG Ally. How scalable is Hellblade 2 and can less capable hardware still deliver a good experience?
</p><p>
As you may expect, Hellblade 2 on Xbox Series S has a few key visual cutbacks relative to its Series X counterpart. The most obvious hit here comes down to reflections. On Series X,

Avalanche founder Christofer Sundberg has hit back at Mad Max film director George Miller for claiming the studio's game "wasn't as good as [he] wanted it to be".
</p><p>
During promotion for the new Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga film, Miller was asked by <a href="https://x.com/gamingbible/status/1792566156810756105">GamingBible</a> about whether a new game was considered alongside the film.
</p><p>
He responded that Avalanche's previous game "wasn't as good as I wanted it to be", adding "I'm one of those people that I'd rather not do something unless you can do it at the highest level". He then said he'd love for Hideo Kojima to take on the challenge of a Mad Max game - because, of course.

The developer of MultiVersus has gone "above and beyond" to ensure the game is protected from dataminers.

The free-to-play fighter is out next week and includes villains like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/multiversus-files-point-to-mark-hamill-as-the-joker">The Joker</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fans-think-the-matrix-is-coming-to-multiversus">Agent Smith from The Matrix</a>, both of which were rumoured long before their reveals.

Now, it seems the developer has put stronger defences in place to protect the game from future dataminers, though there's no guarantee there won't be further leaks.

The game launched worldwide yesterday (UK time) but has already seen multiple hotfixes, the latest of which forced an uninstall and reinstall of the game, Eurogamer can confirm.

An English post on X from Chinese developer Kuro Games has acknowledged the situation and promised players compensation of ten Lustrous Tides - essentially gacha pulls for new characters and weapons.

Infused with Mad Max-y vibes, Fortnite's new season is here - bringing with it the game's Fallout crossover. 
</p><p>
We knew to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-our-first-look-at-fallouts-power-armour-in-fortnite">expect the Fallout T-60 Power Armour</a>, and now know the iconic suit is its own skin in the game, not a power-up. Joining it are a range of other punky wasteland warriors, Magneto from the X-Men, and a character named Peabody that's a pod of... peas.
</p><p>
Speaking of power-ups, Fallout's Nuka-Cola is available for you to chug as a health power-up, while the new Nitro power-up will buff both you (your speed, knockback, stamina rate, reload speed and fall damage immunity) and your vehicle (speed, ramming power, fuel consumption, attack mods).
