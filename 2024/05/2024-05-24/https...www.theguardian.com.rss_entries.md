Alex Ferguson may have kept his job by winning the FA Cup in 1989-90 while Louis van Gaal learned of his dismissal while celebrating on the pitch at Wembley after the 2015-16 final, but the difference in the situations wasn’t just to do with the diminishing value of the FA Cup.</p><p>Perhaps it was always a little anachronistic in 2024 to be wondering whether Erik ten Hag might be saved by victory in Saturday’s FA Cup final, but this had been a weird throwback of a campaign for Manchester United.

<p>Rishi Sunak’s government failed to protect the public, secure the prison estate and deliver swift access to justice</p><p>Prisons tend not to draw political attention except when they go wrong, and even then they have to go badly wrong. There are strong incentives for governments to neglect a service used by relatively few voters, and prisoners themselves can’t vote. But the prison system serves the wider community in various indirect ways. Locking criminals away protects the public. Conviction and punishment signal to society that justice is being done. Rehabilitation inside jails reduces reoffending.

<p>Jazz hands and big ballads are out and ‘writing about real emotions’ is in, as a new wave of musicals exploring body issues, bullying and queer identity hits the capital’s biggest stages. What’s behind this taste for introspection?</p><p>A new breed of musical theatre is rising amid the jukebox singalongs and well-worn classics of the West End stage. It is the mental health musical, an all-singing, all-dancing genre bringing identity and personal crises to the fore. This means many new musicals are preceded by trigger warnings that the performance to come may feature suicidal teens and&nbsp;sexual assault such as in the case&nbsp;of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/apr/04/spring-awakening-review-hope-mill-manchester">Spring Awakening</a>; bullying and&nbsp;queer identity in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/nov/26/everybodys-talking-about-jamie-review-fizzingly-fresh-west-end-musical">Everybody’s Talking About Jamie</a>; high school violence in <a href=

<p>The usual suspects from Provence, Rhône and Languedoc flex their muscles this year, as do tempranillos and bottles from Corsica and Greece. As ever, though, do look for a recent vintage …</p><p>So many people drink rosé year-round these days that it’s easy to forget that it was once regarded as faintly embarrassing. Clearly they’re still at that stage in deepest Umbria, where I recently heard a posh rosé described as “a woman’s wine” – and by a cool-looking young Italian in his 20s, not an unreconstructed 60-year-old with a hairy chest and a medallion, which somehow made it worse. The men in our group indignantly replied that they, too, drank rosé, as indeed most men do. The stuff isn’t even self-consciously referred to as “brosé” these days, either.</p><p>That said, modern rosé is almost invariably a pale baby pink, usually from Provence, which has cornered the market in the more-of-a-white-wine-than-a-pink sort of style. The best lookalikes, if you like drier rosés, tend to be fr

<p><strong>BBCSO/Brabbins/Davis<br />(NMC)</strong><br />Inspired by holidays that the late composer spent in the Isles of Scilly, this three-part collection of his previously unrecorded scores evokes crisp musical images</p><p><a href="https://anthonypayne.org.uk/">Anthony Payne</a>, who died three years ago at the age of 84, is likely to be best remembered for his elaboration of the sketches for Elgar’s Third Symphony into an utterly convincing concert work, first performed in 1998, rather than for his own music. The huge success of the symphony kept Payne from producing more of his own music for several years, and the work with which he resumed composition provides the title for this collection of three of his previously unrecorded orchestral scores. Visions and Journeys was first performed at the Proms in 2002, and it’s that premiere, conducted by the much-missed Andrew Davis, that is included here; it’s a 20-minute orchestral poem, a series of crisp vivid musical images inspired

<p>If you hear the words ‘down by the river’ and immediately start humming one of modern gaming’s most gorgeous earworms, you have the Bafta-winning Borislav Slavov to thank</p><p>For Borislav “Bobby” Slavov, it is not enough to just be a composer. The Bulgarian musician sees himself as a man who wears many hats: composer, music director, arranger, mixer. Yet back in 2002, he had just finished a master’s in computer science and was working for the fourth biggest software company in the world. Unlike a number of other composers I have spoken to for this column, Slavov spends as much time as possible at the game studio he’s working with, embedded in narratives and mechanics “at a granular level” so that his music “isn’t massacred and chopped up”.</p><p>“I remember the very day I came up with that main theme, or Down By the River,” he tells me before a sold out <a href="https://gmfest.com/">Game Music festival</a> concert in London’s Southbank Centre, where the Philharmonia Orchestra per

Pop by for a birthday cocktail, the website seems to say, we’ll cook you a bit of pasta or fish, all while pointing at a menu that includes the likes of fresh linguine tossed in XO-infused mushroom sauce and caramelised leek, and topped with plump Cantabrian anchovies.

<p>My own family didn’t recognise me when I phoned them</p><p>I’ve always been conscious of my accent. In 1996, when I was eight, my family relocated from Kent to Stamford, Lincolnshire, and my estuary accent stuck out like a sore thumb. Everyone sounded so northern to me and I was teased for my “EastEnders voice”. I&nbsp;also struggled to copy accents. When I was 14, we went to Lanzarote, and I&nbsp;made friends with two girls from Liverpool and Birmingham. My attempts to emulate their accents left my family in hysterics. “You sound ridiculous,” my dad laughed.</p><p>I kept my Kent accent through my adult life. Then in 2022, I developed <a href="https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/brain-nerves-and-spinal-cord/functional-neurological-disorder/">functional neurological disorder</a> (FND), a condition that disrupts how the brain communicates with the body.

 My father taught literature and when I was young I liked to take the books down from the shelves in his study and look through the covers.

Also <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/saulbellow">Saul Bellow</a>’s name. How could someone be called Saul Bellow? I imagined him as a bear-like man with a huge beard and flaring nostrils.

The stories were significantly scarier than the Ladybird versions, and accompanied by beautiful, terrifying illustrations. I vividly remember a picture of the devil in a graveyard, leaping through t

Over the preceding couple of years, the Beach Boys’ long-waning commercial fortunes have been unexpectedly restored by a chart-topping compilation of their early hits called Endless Summer. Moreover, the band’s errant mastermind Brian Wilson has been reputedly restored to full fitness after years of drug abuse and mental health problems (“BRIAN IS BACK!” claims a promotional campaign that summer). “I like it, I like it,” crows frontman Mike Love, surveying the audience, as well he might.

<p>The world No 1 identified most of the six positions from previous world championships and exploited Vishy Anand’s unfamiliarity with a classic from Havana 1889</p><p>The innovative Casablanca variant, where today’s best players tested their skills on historic games from the past, sparked some surprise results on its debut in Morocco last weekend. The event had four participants, each representing a continent: the world No&nbsp;1, Magnus Carlsen (Europe), former world champion Vishy Anand (Asia), the world No&nbsp;3, Hikaru Nakamura (America), and Egypt’s top grandmaster, Bassim Amin (Africa).</p><p>Four positions were chosen by experts, two by the audience. Carlsen is well versed in chess history, and correctly identified the Wilhelm Steinitz v Mikhail Chigorin match of 1889, the only world title series featuring the lively Evans Gambit, as well as Gary Kasparov v Anatoly Karpov games from their 1985 and 1987 matches. That knowledge helped Carlsen defeat Anand in the miniature belo

<p><strong>(5020)<br /></strong>The Grammy-nominated Argentine–Spanish singer moves between snarling bombast, acoustic yearning and lavish salsa in her eclectic second album</p><p>In pop’s multilingual landscape, it’s curious that Nathy Peluso isn’t a household name. Huge in Argentina and Spain, her debut album Calambre picked up a Grammy nomination with its blend of neo-soul, Latin trap and 90s hip-hop. Her live performances rival <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/dec/16/rosalia-review-o2-london">Rosalía</a>, and she has the Instagram-friendly aesthetics of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/dua-lipa">Dua Lipa</a>.

She hasn’t even had time to check in when a publicist steers her into the garden and plumps her beneath an awning. She’s being rained on a little and has to reposition her chair. “Let us sit very close together,” she says, which is lovely when she is still and faintly alarming when she’s not. Her emphatic hand gestures almost take my nose off.</p><p>Golino won the best actress prize at Venice (for Francesco Maselli’s A Tale of Love) when she was still a teenager.
