Joining me is the journalist and author who fell from the hearts of the mainstream, Naomi Wolf! Once an advisor to Al Gore and Bill Clinton, she was an instrumental voice in the turn of third-wave feminism. 

Then all of a sudden, the newspapers and journals she had been writing over a decade for had turned on her, and created a hate campaign that led her to be ultimately de-platformed. What happened and what can we learn? See what we uncover as we delve into who really controls the tides of power.

She’s also the author of the new book ‘Facing the Beast: Courage, Faith, and Resistance in a New Dark Age’ -https://www.amazon.com/Facing-Beast-Courage-Faith-Resistance/dp/1645022366
