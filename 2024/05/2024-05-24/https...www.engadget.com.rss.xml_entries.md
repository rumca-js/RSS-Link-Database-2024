<p>YouTube Music for Android is finally releasing a long-awaited tool that lets people hum a song to search for it, in addition to singing the tune or playing the melody on an instrument, according to r<a href="https://9to5google.com/2024/05/24/youtube-music-song-search-android/">eporting by 9to5Google</a>. The software has been in the <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/youtube-music-identify-songs-by-humming-ios/">testing phase since March</a>.</p>
<p>All you have to do is tap the magnifying glass in the top-right corner and look for the waveform icon next to the microphone icon. Tap the waveform icon and start humming or singing. A fullscreen results page should quickly bring up the cover art, song name, artist, album, release year and other important data about the song. The software builds upon the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-09-15-google-now-playing-in-sound-search.html">Pixel’s Now Playing feature</a>, which uses AI to “match the sound to the original recording.”<

<p>Russia has reportedly found new, more effective ways to knock out Ukraine’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spacex-100000-starlink-satellite-internet-terminals-051812274.html">Starlink service</a>. <em>The New York Times</em> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/24/technology/ukraine-russia-starlink.html">said</a> on Friday that the increased interference has disrupted communications at critical moments and is posing “a major threat to Ukraine,” putting the country further on its heels more than two years into the war. How Russia is jamming Elon Musk’s satellite internet terminals is unclear.</p>
<p><em>The New York Times</em> said Russia’s ability to jam communications has thrown off Ukraine’s ability to communicate, gather intelligence and conduct drone strikes. Ukrainian soldiers told the paper that jammed Starlink service stunts their ability to communicate quickly, leaving them scrambling to send text messages (often extremely slowly) to share intel about incoming or ong

<p>The UK has passed a bill that's the country's version of the European Union's Digital Markets Act (DMA). Legislators fast-tracked the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uk-bill-could-protect-consumers-from-subscription-traps-and-fake-reviews-095558923.html">Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers (DMCC) Bill</a> before parliament dissolves on May 30 ahead of a general election in July.</p>

<p>The dog who inspired the famous meme coin Dogecoin has died, according to a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kabosumama/p/C7V8AGvJPm9/"><ins>post on Instagram by its owner</ins></a>. Kabosu, an adorable Shiba Inu, was likely around 18 years old, though owner Atsuko Sato doesn’t know the exact birthdate of the rescue pup.</p>
<p>“She quietly passed away as if asleep while I caressed her,” she wrote in a blog post <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/article/2024/may/24/dog-that-inspired-doge-meme-and-became-the-face-of-dogecoin-dies"><ins>published by </ins><em><ins>The Guardian</ins></em></a>. “I think Kabo-chan was the happiest dog in the world.

<p>It's taken <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/">Nintendo</a> two decades, but the company is finally ready to open a second store in the US. The new location in San Francisco’s Union Square is set to open its doors in 2025. Details about Nintendo San Francisco are thin for now, but the company <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240524129507/en/Nintendo-Announces-Plans-for-Official-Store-in-San-Francisco/">said</a> it will allow &quot;visitors from near and far to experience the world of Nintendo, its products and characters.&quot; More information will be revealed in the leadup to the ribbon-cutting ceremony.</p>
<p>Nintendo opened its New York store at Rockefeller Center 19 years ago this month, though there was previously a Pokémon Center at the same location. Along with merchandise and kiosks where visitors can play some Switch games, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-02-19-nintendo-ny-grand-opening.html">New York store</a> has a mini museu

<p>Lucid Motors has cut 400 jobs, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1811210/000110465924064914/tm2415482d1_8k.htm"><ins>according to a regulatory filing</ins></a>. This amounts to around six percent of the workforce. Incidentally, the company also cut a whopping 1,300 jobs last year. This all comes just ahead of the launch of its <a href="https://lucidmotors.com/stories/introducing-lucid-gravity"><ins>first electric SUV later this year</ins></a>, a crucial release for the auto manufacturer.</p>
<p>You can likely guess as to the reasoning given for the layoffs. The 400 people got pink slips due to the ever-useful and nebulous term known as “restructuring.” To that end, the company says it expects this restructuring to be completed by the end of the third quarter, though it didn’t say anything about rehiring anyone.</p>

<p>Epic Games has an uncanny habit of making sure <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/fortnite/"><em><ins>Fortnite</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>is in tune with the cultural zeitgeist and that's very much the case once again. After a strong season focused on Greek gods and monsters, the latest major revamp of the battle royale is taking a vehicle-heavy, post-apocalyptic turn in Chapter 5 Season 3.</p>
<p>The new season, which is dubbed &quot;Wrecked,&quot; seems very much inspired by Mad Max, given the desert vibe and modded vehicles. It includes an official <a href="https://www.engadget.com/a-fallout-crossover-is-coming-to-fortnite-165853292.html"><ins>Fallout crossover</ins></a> too.

## Crow Country is a darkly meditative callback to survival horror’s past

<p>Is it blasphemous to call a survival horror game “cozy”? Maybe so, but while thinking back on my playthrough of <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://crowcountrygame.com/"><em>Crow Country</em></a>, the word popped into my mind more than a few times.</p>
<p>From the jump, there's no question about <em>Crow Country</em>’s PlayStation 1 influences, which its creators at SFB Games have been upfront about: it is very intentionally the creepy-cute child of <em>Resident Evil</em>, <em>Silent Hill</em> and <em>Final Fantasy VII.</em> The game, which was released on Steam, PlayStation 5 and Xbox X/S on May 9, just about checks all the boxes for survival horror, but it takes a gentler approach to the genre, making it feel more like a test of mental endurance against some all-consuming bleakness than a constant fight for your life. (A Hard Mode, however, is <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://x.com/SFBDim/status/1790423223437308351">apparently on the way</a>).</p>

<p><em>Challengers</em>, the tennis movie starring Zendaya, Mike Faist and Josh O'Connor, is not the first movie you'd think of for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/watch-vfx-bring-westworlds-dystopian-la-to-life-100508512.html">visual effects</a>. But the film uses them to a surprising extent: One shot in particular, a 24-second volley between two of the protagonists from the perspective of the ball, used extensive digital and practical effects, as VFX supervisor Brian Drewes <a href="https://x.com/BrianVFX/status/1793672153184747756">explained on X</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The live plates were shot with an Arri Alexa LF on a 30-foot technocrane during a period of five hours with stunt doubles, according to Drewes. 23 individual shots were stitched together to create the final sequence.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Microsoft is leaning even more into AI after launching a new Copilot+ AI PC initiative earlier this year. It's a new set of standards for PCs with powerful neural processing units (NPUs), and it could be just as significant for Windows as Apple's move towards its M-series chips. In this episode, Cherlynn and Devindra discuss Copilot+ and the potential rise of Arm-based Windows systems, and we dive into the new Surface Pro and Surface Laptop.</p>

Details of the contract the Korean giant asks repair stores to sign include some pretty user-unfriendly rules.</p>
<p>That includes sending your details and device identification to HQ, including all of the details of your repair issue. And, if your phone is found to be using an aftermarket, or non-Samsung part, the store has to instantly disassemble it and raise the alarm. That’s quite problematic, and also probably in violation of US laws around the right to use third-party parts for repair.</p>

<p>French for “under vacuum,” sous vide cooking involves immersing vacuum-sealed food in a temperature-controlled water bath until the food is cooked to your liking. It might sound intimidating, and it’s true that this cooking method was once the province of professional cooks with expensive equipment. But that’s not the case anymore — not only is sous vide cooking more accessible than ever now, but there are a number of sous vide machines out there that don’t cost a fortune. And, like a lot of kitchen tools now, many sous vide devices even have companion apps and Wi-Fi connectivity that make the process even more automated. If you’re curious about giving sous vide cooking a go, we’ll walk you through the process of choosing the right machine for you and share some of the tips and tricks we’ve learned through our own experiments.</p>
