It may be masochistic – but it’s impossible to look away</p><p>Unlike most reality television stars, Jerrod Carmichael doesn’t seem to care about showing his best self. In fact, in Jerrod Carmichael Reality Show – which candidly documents the stand-up comedian’s life in the wake of his Emmy award-winning comedy special Rothaniel – he seems happy enough broadcasting things most people would take to the grave. He films a painfully awkward romantic rejection when he confesses his love for long-time friend Tyler the Creator over room service. He admits his love of race play and spitting into people’s mouths. And, after hours of therapy over a potential sex addiction, we watch him cheat on the first person he has ever loved.</p><p>For a talent like Carmichael, whose work has netted him huge acclaim, reality television might seem an odd choice. The genre is largely populated by the talentless and

Would he say that if the situation were reversed?</p><p>This month, the Texas state parole board unanimously recommended the pardon and release of convicted killer and former US army sergeant Daniel Perry, along with the restoration of his firearm rights. Perry had been working as an Uber driver in July 2020 when he shot and killed Garrett Foster, a white man who was attending a Black Lives Matter protest with his Black fiancee. Perry was later indicted for murder, tried, convicted and sentenced to 25 years in prison by an Austin jury.</p><p>Almost a year from the date of his sentencing, Perry’s pardon was granted by Texas governor Greg Abbott, and he now walks free.

<p>The Observer’s art critic combines the stories of the painter Carel Fabritius with that of her artist father, in a memoir of art and life cut suddenly short</p><p>On the morning of 12<sup> </sup>October 1654, there was a huge explosion in the town of Delft in the Netherlands. The 32-year-old painter Carel Fabritius, previously a student of Rembrandt’s, had not long sat down at his easel to paint a portrait of a retired churchman. The blast, caused by a nearby gunpowder store accidentally set alight, was so loud it could be heard 70 miles away, and caused the roof of Fabritius’s house to fall in.
