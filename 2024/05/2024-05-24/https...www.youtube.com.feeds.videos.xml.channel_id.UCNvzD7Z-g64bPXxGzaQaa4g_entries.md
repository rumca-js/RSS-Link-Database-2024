Thank you VITURE for sponsoring this video. You’ve gotta try it for yourself — and when you do, use my links to get 10% off everything but the new glasses. VITURE Store: https://pro.viture.com/Gameranx  VITURE Amazon: http://viture.us/Gameranx. You’re going to love it. Give it a shot, it’s a must-have for any serious Steam Deck fan! #VITURE #VITUREPro #UltraClarity

VITURE Pro XR Glasses & the Mobile Dock Pro are hands down the best way to play Steam Deck. I am amazed by the UltraClarity™ of the virtual screen, definitely the best I have ever seen! Everything is so vivid and sharp! After playing Ghosts of Tsushima on VITURE Pro’s massive virtual display, I don’t think I can ever go back to playing on the Steam Deck’s built-in screen.
