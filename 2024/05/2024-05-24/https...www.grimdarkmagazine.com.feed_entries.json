Naming has been an integral part of fantasy literature for decades. The foundation of Ursula K. Le Guin\u2019s magic system in Earthsea is based on the knowledge of so-called true names, which capture the language of creation and the wisdom of the creator. Le Guin\u2019s emphasis on true names had an enormous impact on subsequent fantasy literature, such as The Naming by Alison Croggon and The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss. More recently, the magical power of language is the raison d\u2019\u00eatre of R.F. Kuang\u2019s Babel. Reverence for language and the power of naming is as old as humanity itself, nearly ubiquitous across world religions and folklore. Creation is inexorably linked to language, as evident in the opening verse of the Gospel of John: \u201cIn the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.\u201d Moreover, early in the Book of Genes", "language": "en-AU", "link": "https://www.grimdarkmagazine.com/review-the-naming-song-by-jedediah-berry", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.grimdarkmagazine.com/feed", "source_obj__id": 137, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "REVIEW: The Naming Song by Jedediah Berry", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
