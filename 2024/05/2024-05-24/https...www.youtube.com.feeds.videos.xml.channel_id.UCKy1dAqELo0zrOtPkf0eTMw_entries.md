In today's Daily Fix:
The new Battle Pass for Fortnite: Chapter 5 - Season 3 is now live and it comes with a new biome, new outfits, new...well, a lot of things. Most importantly, the iconic T-60 Power Armor from the Fallout franchise will be available (after some grinding), allowing you to conquer the new Wasteland biome in style. Also available in the Battle Pass is an outfit that turns you into everyone's favorite magnetically charged mutant, Magneto. In other news, Naughty Dog's Neil Druckmann shared his thoughts on AI in an interview with Sony. Druckmann seems pretty optimistic about how new AI tools can enhance storytelling in games, but did bring up concerns over the ethics of such tools. And finally, hot on the heels of The Joker in The Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League comes a new villain.

## Atlas Review

Atlas reviewed by Matt Donato. Now streaming on Netflix.
Atlas earns more than a shrug, even if it won’t settle relevant and alarming debates about artificial intelligence’s place in contemporary society. Brad Peyton oversees a futuristic action thriller that frequently plays like a clone of other cautionary tales about AI – but those movies, shows, games, and books don’t have Peyton’s secret weapon: Jennifer Lopez. She’s able to command the screen, bicker with software programs, and sell a convincing heroine’s arc from behind a mech-suit’s windshield. Atlas is far from the “Justice for AI!” disaster its premise implies, and while it’s not the next groundbreaking sci-fi epic, it earns points for building an entertaining, adequately executed movie around a hot-button topic.
