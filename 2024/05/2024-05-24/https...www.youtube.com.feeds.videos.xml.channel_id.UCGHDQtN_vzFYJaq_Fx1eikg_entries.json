But do you know what makes it so mysterious?\n\n\n\"The Bermuda Triangle, also known as the Devil's Triangle, is an urban legend focused on a loosely defined region in the western part of the North Atlantic Ocean where a number of aircraft and ships are said to have disappeared under mysterious circumstances. The idea of the area as uniquely prone to disappearances arose in the mid-20th century, but most reputable sources dismiss the idea that there is any mystery.\"\n\nMore on Wikipedia: \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bermuda_Triangle\n\nJoin membership: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGHDQtN_vzFYJaq_Fx1eikg/join\nSecond Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt93hxFmjppL5nLRAX94UrA\nMerch: https://qxir.creator-spring.com/\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/qxir\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/QxirYT\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100091768766293\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/qxiryt/\nTiktok: https://www.t", "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1eQOQSi03RY", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCGHDQtN_vzFYJaq_Fx1eikg", "source_obj__id": 447, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/1eQOQSi03RY/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Why Do Ships Disappear in the Bermuda Triangle? | Enigma Files", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
