The company\u00a0announced Wednesday\u00a0that none of the resolutions had passed, but detailed results were not previously available. The resolutions requesting additional reporting on warehouse working conditions and Amazon&#8217;s handling of collective bargaining rights garnered around 30% of shareholders votes for approval, well short of the majority required for passage. Both issues also led shareholder votes at last year&#8217;s meeting.

A team at the University of Washington wants to help the educators recoup some of those hours and at the same time produce better lessons. Over the past two years, the group has developed a product called Colleague that uses AI and chatbots to assist K-12 teachers. It&#8217;s now available to them for free. &#8220;We&#8217;ve really designed this with and for teachers,&#8221; said Min Sun, director of Artificial Intelligence for Education in the UW&#8217;s College of Education and&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2024/chatbots-for-teachers-univ-of-washington-releases-free-ai-tool-for-quicker-better-lesson-plans/\">Read More</a>", "language": "en-US", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2024/chatbots-for-teachers-univ-of-washington-releases-free-ai-tool-for-quicker-better-lesson-plans", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed", "source_obj__id": 131, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Chatbots for teachers: Univ. of Washington releases free AI tool for quicker, better lesson plans", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-05-24T14:59:19+00:00", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"723\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Screenshot-2024-05-17-at-10.57.57-AM-1260x723.png\" width=\"1260\" /><br />Would it be possible to build an AI summer intern? Kevin Leneway, principal software engineer at Pioneer Square Labs, had that thought last year as an early user of GitHub Copilot who been experimenting with various uses of GPT in his development workflows. The idea led Leneway to create JACoB, an acronym for the tongue-in-cheek name, &#8220;Just Another Coding Bot.&#8221; Introduced earlier this year, the project has evolved significantly based on user feedback and validation. This week, it was released as an open-source project by Pioneer Square Labs, the Seattle-based startup studio. JACoB integrates with GitHub and other common tools,&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2024/not-just-another-coding-bot-pioneer-square-labs-releases-jacob-ai-agent-as-open-source-project/\">Read More<", "language": "en-US", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2024/not-just-another-coding-bot-pioneer-square-labs-releases-jacob-ai-agent-as-open-source-project", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed", "source_obj__id": 131, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Not just another coding bot: Pioneer Square Labs releases JACoB AI agent as open-source project", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-05-24T14:10:07+00:00", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"1260\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Jim-Loter_suit_2023-1260x1260.jpg\" width=\"1260\" /><br />As the interim CTO of the City of Seattle and leader of IT-related projects within the city\u2019s departments, Jim Loter has deep insights into how municipal employees use emerging technology and the steps necessary to manage the risks associated with generative artificial intelligence.
