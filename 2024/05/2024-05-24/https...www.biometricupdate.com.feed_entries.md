		UK parliament will not pass data protection legislation during the current session, following the announcement of the general election in the United Kingdom. The <a href="https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3430">Data Protection and Digital Information Bill</a> (DPDI) was abandoned following a period of uncertainty surrounding the future of pending legislation. The government has now entered the “wash-up” period, in which final bills are considered for passage before the dissolution of Parliament. The DPDI did not make the cut.

The elimination of the Biometrics and Surveillance Camera Commissioner role is now on hold. The bill would have transferred <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202312/uk-data-protection-bill-advances-despite-warnings-on-ai-alignment-with-e

		The use of facial recognition to streamline air passenger’s travel journeys only complies with Europe’s data protection regulations in certain circumstances, the European Data Protection Board has ruled.

The EDPB issued the ruling in response to a request from the French Supervisory Authority to issue an opinion on whether biometric authentication by airlines or airports complies with the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation.

In its “<a href="https://www.edpb.europa.eu/system/files/2024-05/edpb_opinion_202411_facialrecognitionairports_en.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Opinion 11/2024 on the use of facial recognition to streamline airport passengers’ flow (compatibility with Articles 5(1)(e) and(f), 25 and 32 GDPR</a>,” the EDPB finds that

		New Zealand is <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202404/new-zealand-welcomes-input-on-draft-biometrics-code">working</a> on creating a biometrics Code of Practice as the country introduces more facial recognition applications. A local business group, however, is arguing that the Code could “potentially worsen privacy outcomes for people and should not proceed.”

In a letter addressed to the Office of the Privacy Commissioner, Digital Identity NZ (<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/">DINZ</a>) says that guidelines on the use of biometric technology would be beneficial. The digital ID advocacy group also claims that the Office of the Privacy Commissioner does not have the expertise to create the guidelines by itself.

“The proposed Code is a response to public conc

The new update allows American Express and Capital One cardholders using Chrome desktop to see specific card benefits at checkout. Google has plans to include more cards in the future.

In a bid to improve both speed and security, Google Pay has updated its autofill verification process on Chrome and Android, so that its users can now fill in their card details using their device's fingerprint, face scan, or screen lock PIN, rather than manually entering their security code. The update’s use of biometric technology aims to streamline the checkout process while maintaining security. In most cases, autofill wi
