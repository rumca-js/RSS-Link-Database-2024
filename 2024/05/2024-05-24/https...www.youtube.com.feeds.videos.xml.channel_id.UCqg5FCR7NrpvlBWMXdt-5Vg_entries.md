The Dark Souls formula has become so popular and influential, that it's inspired other developers to create their own versions of souls-inspired games. Titles such as Lords of the Fallen and Lies of P have contributed to what we know as the Souls-like genre and it's not slowing down anytime soon. However, the growth of the genre has caused gamers and journalists to give the souls-like tag to games where it doesn't belong.
