LattePanda's Mu is the latest entrant in the 'Pi Killer' battle, but it has a trick up its sleeve.

LattePanda sent me the Mu and carrier board for review, so I'm marking this video as having a 'product placement'â€”however, they had no input into the video's contents, and have paid nothing for me to talk about their product.

Some of the things I mentioned in this video:

  - LattePanda Mu: https://www.lattepanda.com/lattepanda-mu
  - My SBC Reviews GitHub repo: https://github.com/geerlingguy/sbc-reviews
  - Radxa Rock 5C: https://radxa.com/products/rock5/5c/
  - Radxa CM5: https://radxa.com/products/computer-on-module/cm/cm5
  - Turing RK1: https://turingpi.com/product/turing-rk1/
  - Raspberry Pi 5: https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-5/
