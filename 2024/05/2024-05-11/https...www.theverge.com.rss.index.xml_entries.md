  <p id="Cg7qQ2">Google is preparing to hold its annual Google I/O developer conference next week, and naturally, it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/11/24152977/android-ai-google-io-2024-gemini">will be all about AI</a>. The company has made no secret of that. Since last year’s I/O, it has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/6/23990466/google-gemini-llm-ai-model">debuted Gemini</a>, its new, more powerful model meant to compete with OpenAI’s ChatGPT, and has been deep in testing new features for Search, Google Maps, and Android.

  <p id="zz8BYP">Even as modern horror games become <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/23/14353714/resident-evil-7-biohazard-review-ps4-xbox-one-pc">unnervingly immersive</a>, there’s still a place for the particular mood of old-school survival horror.
