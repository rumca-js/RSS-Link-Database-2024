There are tons of VPNs for everyday use, but what about business solutions? I've decided to do a full-on NordLayer review so you can decide if it's good enough for your business!

💼 Why do you need a VPN for your business?

More people with access to business information means more ways to get breached. And even though businesses implement better security measures to prevent breaches than ever before, data breach costs worldwide still increase every year. 

A business VPN can help prevent it by letting you or your employees safely access the company's resources from anywhere in the world. It secures all internet traffic with encryption. Besides it may offer extra company-wide security like two-factor authentication - 2FA and Single sign-on, better known as SSO.
