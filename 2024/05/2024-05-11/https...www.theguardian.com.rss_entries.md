On their second, she found someone who would wait for her, no matter what</p><p>The odds that Mike and I would ever meet were low. We both grew up in Perth – the only problem being he was in Perth, Scotland, and I was in Perth, Western Australia. We then managed to find ourselves living in the same place (Melbourne) but on different sides of the city an hour’s drive apart.</p><p>It was 2014, we’d both been divorced for about five years and neither of us was having much luck with internet dating. It didn’t help that my online profile was set to only show matches who lived within a 5km radius of my house. So while I really wanted to find love, I apparently wasn’t willing to look further than walking distance from my front door. The algorithm very sensibly ignored me and matched me with Mike. I was intrigued by his profile; his heading was: “Looking for a woman who can make me

<p>When it finally arrived, there was an air of resignation from Vincent Kompany. For almost 40 minutes of the second half, his Burnley side had somehow held out in the face of a Tottenham onslaught as Ange Postecoglou’s side launched wave after wave of attacks.</p><p>Having taken a surprise lead in the first half through Jacob Bruun Larsen’s well-taken strike, a Tottenham fightback thanks to goals from Pedro Porro and Micky van den Ven ended Burnley’s brave resistance and confirmed that they are heading back to where they came from 12 months ago. But as well as keeping up their slim chances of reaching the Champions League – only a victory over Manchester City on Tuesday that could hand Arsenal the title will suffice as they bid to catch Aston Villa in fourth spot – there was also relief for Postecoglou as he avoided becoming the first Spurs manager since Ossie Ardiles in 1994 to lose five league games in a row. While this was far from a return to their free-flowing best from earlier

<p>On her <a href="https://www.instagram.com/brutalistplants/">@brutalistplants Instagram page</a>, Olivia Broome collects photographs that combine the angular shapes of raw concrete with the greenery of the natural world. “I really enjoy the aesthetic of eco-brutalism and tropical modernism,” she says. “I love mezzanines and ziggurats, and when you pair them with plants it softens them up. Brutalism can be this quite harsh, austere architecture style, but with nature involved, it balances it all out.” Now collected in a book, the images bring together buildings from across the globe, from Hong Kong to Sri Lanka, London to Mexico. “It’s a pleasant movement that people can get behind, especially in smaller spaces and modern cities – it’s nice to fill them with plants and nature.” <br /><br />• <a href="https://www.hoxtonminipress.com/collections/books/products/pre-order-brutalist-plants">Brutalist Plants (Hoxton Mini Press, £20) will be published on Thursday</a></p> <a href="https://ww

<p>(Acid Jazz)<br />A collective of genre-straddling talents give new life to songs by Nick Drake, John Martyn and Sandy Denny</p><p>Jazz and British folk enjoyed a fruitful communion in the late 60s and early 70s, primarily via Pentangle, a group entwining folk guitars with a jazz rhythm section and the agile voice of Jacqui McShee. London saxophonist Sean Khan revisits the era with elan here, delivering instrumental versions of hallowed ballads and vocal updates of songs by Pentangle, Nick Drake and John Martyn. Fair to say that the unnamed woman in She Moves Through the Fair has never bustled along in quite such sprightly fashion, led by Khan’s lyrical flute and Andy Noble’s rippling piano. Switching to soprano sax, Khan’s take on Sandy Denny’s Who Knows Where the Time Goes trades the song’s wistfulness for breezy optimism.</p><p>McShee herself rolls back the years to sing Pentangle’s I’ve Got A Feeling and Light Flight, sounding <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-I_yxMGfug

<p>People wept in the street when the magnificent Mackintosh building was nearly destroyed by two fires. So why, 10 years on and despite overwhelming support for restoration, is there still no plan – or funding – for its repair?</p><p>Where to start with the Mackintosh building of the Glasgow School of Art? With its fearless originality? With its ability to run many gamuts – dark, light, massive, intimate, crafted, industrial, refined, rough, its spaces long, narrow, high and wide, its conversion of Glaswegian manufacturing wealth into a hilltop castle of art of Scottish baronial might and Japanese-inspired delicacy? Its handling of the things that make architecture beautiful – materials, proportion, detail, ornament, structure, light, contrast – was consummate. It worked magic with stone, iron, oak, stained glass and bent tin, enamel and electric lights, with engineering borrowed from shipyards and with skinny tendrils of plant-like ornament that teetered on the edge of kitsch.

<p>Far from making programmers an endangered species, AI will release them from the grunt work that stifles innovation</p><p>When digital computers were invented, the first task was to instruct them to do what we wanted. The problem was that the machines didn’t understand English – they only knew ones and zeros. You could program them with long sequences of these two digits and if you got the sequence right then the machines would do what you wanted. But life’s too short for composing infinite strings of ones and zeros, so we began designing programming languages that allowed us to express our wishes in a human-readable form that could then be translated (by a piece of software called a “compiler”) into terms that machines could understand and obey.</p><p>Over the next 60 years or so, these programming languages – with names such as Fortran, Basic, Algol, COBOL, PL/1, LISP, C, C++, Python – proliferated like rabbits, so that there are now many hundreds, perhaps even thousands, of them

<p>Pep Guardiola had feared seeing Manchester City’s title defence kicked into the long grass at Craven Cottage but they cut yet another opponent down to size. Fulham were keen enough to make a game of things and it was no reflection on them that barely anybody has any answers when the champions take a stranglehold on proceedings like this. Only Arsenal have a chance of responding and, if a mercurial Manchester United find it in themselves to perform a neighbourly favour on Sunday, the pursuers will probably be silenced too. Two wins in the next week will see City over the line regardless of events at Old Trafford.</p><p>When the dust has settled on this season Arsenal may rue their New Year’s Eve no-show at this venue. The stakes were more obvious for City here but they never looked like fluffing their lines. Erling Haaland was off beam but the left-back Josko Gvardiol, who has produced five goals in his last seven games, simply took over instead. Gvardiol began this procession and a

<p>The actor and writer examines what drove his father to weave a false tale of an epic wartime journey from Poland to Inverness</p><p>It was some years after my dad died that I discovered he was a liar. I loved him enormously. But he was a liar. I grew up in Inverness where my father Mateusz was a well-liked tailor. He was also a refugee with an East European accent who had fled his village in south-east Poland during the second world war.</p><p>Dad had always been a bit vague about his past but I figured that, like many of his generation, he didn’t like talking about the war. It was only when I went to his home village in 2003, now in western Ukraine, that I discovered the stories my father told us about his early years were just that, stories. He told lies about his religion, his family and what he did during the war: they just tumbled out, one after the other.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/may/11/matthew-zajac-i-set-out-to-write-about-my-fathers-life-

The front half sank to the riverbed dragging me down with it, and I felt myself disappearing beneath the rapid. Behind my back the broken stern splayed upwards towards the air, braced by the drop’s ledge, jamming the kayak in the rapid. The rounded front deck flattened onto my legs from the river’s force, trapping my knees. The overwhelming power of the water against my back pushed me up off the kayak seat so that I wasn’t sitting but hovering above it, fixed in place by my jammed, crushed legs.</p><p>The river was now rolling o

The acclaimed, perpetually TikTok-viral indie rock musician had been touring hard in 2022, and began to feel her body breaking down.

The 16-year-old exhales with her head thrown back, collapsing into laughter that causes smoke to billow out of her mouth. The clip is grainy and shaky – as if shot in low light by someone who had zoomed in on Madi’s face – but it was damning. Madi was a cheerleader with the Victory Vipers, a highly competitive “all-star” squad based in Doylestown, Pennsylvania. The Vipers had a strict code of conduct; being caught partying and vaping could have got her thrown out of the team. And in July 2020, an anonymous person sent the incriminating video directly to Madi’s coaches.</p><p>Eight months later, that footage was the subject of a police news conference. “The police reviewed the video

<p>The Irish author on the follow-up to his bestselling novel, being blanked at the Oscars and the joys of giving up drinking</p><p>Colm Tóibín does not approve of sequels. “It would have been a disaster if Pride and Prejudice had a sequel. It would have been a disaster if Ulysses had a sequel. Imagine!” the Irish novelist exclaims from his study in Columbia University, New York, where he teaches. “It ends with Molly Bloom asleep, then you’d suddenly realise, ‘Oh, my God, it’s starting another day.’”</p><p>Yet fans of Tóibín’s novel Brooklyn will be delighted to know that after a gap of nearly 15 years he has overcome these misgivings to write a follow-up, Long Island. Set in the 1950s, Brooklyn takes the fairytale of New York – an Irish girl who emigrates to America – and turns it into a heartbreaking story of homesickness and regret (it is a Colm Tóibín novel, after all).

<p>A simple, one-tray take on Hainanese chicken rice, heady with ginger and topped with a spring onion oil, and braised broad beans in their pods with chilli and garlic</p><p>Setting ourselves a five-ingredient limit on any recipe really gets the Ottolenghi test kitchen going. Well, that, or it sends us spiralling into existential doubt, not least regarding what, exactly, constitutes an ingredient. Everyone has salt and pepper, right, so we don’t need to include them in the tally? What about white pepper: is that the same? Water’s not an ingredient, either – it’s not something we need to go out and buy. But does that mean tinfoil<em> is</em>? Can we squeeze in olive oil on a free pass? Or garlic? And what if something is just a serving suggestion, rather than a built-in part of the recipe? How about we just put every ingredient in the title, to highlight how simple and short the ingredient list is? For a group of recipe-creating obsessives, never has counting to five felt so confusing

In Dev Patel’s seething directorial debut <strong><a href="https://www.justwatch.com/uk/movie/monkey-man">Monkey Man</a></strong>, the quest is familiar – as his streetwise hero seeks retribution for his mother’s murder – but the sheer gusto of his vengeance is invigorating, down to driving a dagger into a villain’s throat with his teeth.</p><p>The modern revenge movie is largely characterised by such kinetic action and extreme

At least, I think I did?</p><p>The air is warm, the sun is shining and the dog is capering across the bedroom, claws clacking against the floorboards, under the impression that 5.30 in the morning counts as morning.</p><p>“Stop it!” my wife says, from somewhere under the duvet, but the dog continues to prance and spin, celebrating the promise of the day ahead. Four weeks ago we thought it was about to die of some weird mystery ailment; a month later the dog is not just healthy but jubilant, and we are daily forced to endure its newfound appreciation of the little things.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/article/2024/may/11/tim-dowling-im-less-of-a-jerk-in-my-dreams-than-in-real-life-well-sometimes">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Nine months after a court quashed my conviction, I’m living on universal credit. Why is it so hard for victims like me to get compensation?</p><p>When I emerged blinking into the sunlight outside the court of appeal last July as a “free man”, I was also an impoverished one. I was living on universal credit, homeless and in urgent need of mental health support from clinicians who would at last recognise what I had been through in the past 20 years.</p><p>In the days after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jul/26/appeal-court-overturns-manchester-rape-conviction-of-man-who-spent-17-years-in-jail-andrew-malkinson">my exoneration</a>, news stories were followed by comments from the public suggesting that I must be due a major payout from the state. Millions, they reckoned. Enough to make sure I could own a home, make up for lost time and secure the support I needed for my mental health. This week I found myself in line at the local food bank. I am so grateful to the peo

<p>Gina Jacobs, from the Wirral, is calling for the government to apologise to parents of stillborn babies</p><p>Until the 1980s and 1990s, bereaved parents of stillborn children were kept in the dark by doctors and midwives over the fate of their lost infants. Gina Jacobs was one of those parents. In 1969 her son Robert was stillborn and he was taken from her before she was able to see his face.</p><p>Fifty-three years passed before Jacobs tracked down Robert’s burial site, revealing not just his fate but also the lies told about his disposal. She has since helped families locate the burial site of more than 60 stillborn children and, with the support of parliamentarians, is calling for a formal government apology for what she and others argue was in effect official policy for disposing of stillborn children.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/article/2024/may/11/the-woman-helping-families-find-where-their-stillborn-children-are-buried">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘The issue is when to pull the trigger’: how prepared are we for human bird flu?

<p>The H5N1 virus has been devastating bird populations, and is now infecting mammals too. Is human-to-human transmission next? And are we ready for another pandemic?</p><p>Over the past four years, a silent pandemic has been raging. One in which the death toll is believed to number in the hundreds of millions, but which has received remarkably little attention until now.</p><p>The pandemic in question is bird flu, the H5N1 strain of influenza, which since 2020 has moved far beyond the avian world and into mammals ranging from dairy cattle to domestic pets, and species that live on our doorsteps, such as foxes. The virus’s presence has been detected on every continent, even Antarctica. While it has yet to evolve the capability of spreading between humans, alarm bells were raised last month after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/01/texas-bird-flu">a dairy farm worker in Texas contracted H5N1</a>, seemingly from cattle.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/a
