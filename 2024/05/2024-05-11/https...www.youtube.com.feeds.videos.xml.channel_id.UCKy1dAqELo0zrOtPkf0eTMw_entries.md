We are almost halfway through the year and we’ve had some phenomenal games released so far, but there are still so many still to come in 2024!  In this video we list over 50 games that are expected to be released this year, or at the very least, that we hope will!  From Elden Ring & Final Fantasy XIV getting expansions, Killer Klowns, and two Star Wars games, there are so many games to look forward to in the last half of this year.

May has brought us the surprise release of Hades 2, and will soon also bring Ghost of Tsushima to PC.  Hellblade 2 is on it’s way in May, as is Multiversus and F1 24!  In June you can look forward to Star Wars Hunters, an expansion for Destiny 2, and Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD.  Looking ahead into July, keep your eyes open for Frost Punk 2, Dungeons of Hinterberg, and the Legend of Heroes Trails Through Daybreak.  August looks pretty exciting because we are getting World of Goo 2, Black Myth Wukong and Star Wars Outlaws. Even further into the year, we have STALK

A not so long time ago in a galaxy very close by, the idea of new entries in blockbuster franchises that were guaranteed to be the biggest movies of the year wasn’t actually a given. Extravagantly expensive, four-quadrant, IP-based entertainment may be the lay of the land today, but rolling the clock back even a quarter of a century shows a very different world for big budget filmmaking. Believe it or not, science-fiction and superhero franchises weren’t all the rage, studio movies didn’t always cost obscene amounts, and the entirety of the Star Wars saga consisted of three theatrical films (and no, the Holiday Special and Ewok movies don’t count).

But all of that changed on May 19th, 1999, when George Lucas and 20th Century Fox released Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace. What was at the time merely a highly anticipated continuation of one of the most iconic film trilogies in Hollywood history has proven to have possibly been the landmark moment that distinguished how movies

Rockstar Games dropped the GTA 6 trailer last year, but when can we expect to see the second Grand Theft Auto 6 trailer, going into further details on what to expect? We got our first look at what to expect in terms of graphics, narrative tone for the story, and a clear look at our main protagonist Lucia. We also got a release window for the game, with it coming to us in 2025. But the first trailer for #GTA6 left a lot to be desired. Akeem Lawanson, along with special guest panelists J.D. Witherspoon and Goldenboy take a look at the previous #RockstarGames trailer release schedules for its major AAA games to come up with a speculative yet logical timeline for the second trailer hitting the Internet. This is all barring any sort of leaks that might happen to force Rockstar’s hand in doing yet another surprise drop, as unfortunately it’s happened in the past. But enough about that, let’s get into why you’re here: The GTA 6 second trailer and when you can expect it, what to expect to see

Once a scrappy startup within a buttoned-up institution, Xbox and its longtime leader Phil Spencer are now struggling to keep Xbox on a path gamers can trust and believe in amidst over $75 billion of gigantic acquisitions and unexpected board-level and regulatory scrutiny. Can Xbox's soul be saved? Podcast Unlocked host Ryan McCaffrey discusses that very topic.
