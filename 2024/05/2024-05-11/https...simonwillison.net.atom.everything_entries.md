I scraped a pass of my Ham radio general exam this morning. One of the tools I used to help me pass was a Datasette instance with all 429 questions from the official question pool. I've published that raw data as JSON on GitHub, which I converted from the official question pool document using <a href="https://observablehq.com/@simonw/ham-general-2024">an Observable notebook</a>.</p>
