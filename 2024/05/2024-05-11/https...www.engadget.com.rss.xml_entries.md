<p>Fans have been waiting a long, long time for another installment in the 28 Days Later franchise, and we now know when the next followup is coming out: June 20, 2025. Per <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://variety.com/2024/film/news/28-years-later-release-date-june-2025-1235999311/"><em><ins>Variety</ins></em></a>, Sony Pictures announced the release date for the upcoming film <em>28 Years Later </em>on Friday. It would have been kind of cool if it were timed with the original film’s actual 28th anniversary in 2030, considering how close we are to that now (horrifying, I know), but I can't blame them for not keeping people hanging even longer.</p>
<p><em>28 Days Later</em>, starring Cillian Murphy in what turned out to be his breakout role, came out in 2002, and was followed by a sequel with a different cast, <em>28 Weeks Later</em>, in 2007. There were at one point murmurs of plans for <em>28 Months Later, </em>but it looks like we’re skipping over that. The new film will b

<p><em>In this installment of What We're Listening To, Engadget writers and editors discuss some of the recent music releases we've had on repeat. It's safe to say there's some variety on this list. </em></p>
<h3 id="jump-link-sierra-ferrell---trail-of-flowers">Sierra Ferrell - <strong><em>Trail of Flowers</em></strong>&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Sierra Ferrell seems almost like an anachronism in 2024, but in the best possible way. She has this effortless, old-timey country style that is at points reminiscent of the likes of The Carter Family or Flatt and Scruggs (her <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNYPhcn34nA">brilliant covers</a> of songs once performed by the latter duo are permanently seared into my brain), and it’s just so refreshing. <em>Trail of Flowers</em>, Ferrell’s second studio album, toes a little further into a more modern sound, but it maintains this deeply Americana feel that just seems to roll off the West Virginia-born artist so naturally.</p>

<p>If you've been seeing more Waymo robotaxis recently in Phoenix, San Francisco and Los Angeles, that's because more and more people are hailing one for a ride. The Alphabet-owned company has <a href="https://twitter.com/Waymo/status/1788693361047515522">announced</a> on Twitter/X that it's now serving more than 50,000 paid trips every week across three cities. Waymo One operates 24/7 in parts of those cities. If the company is getting 50,000 rides a week, that means it receives an average of 300 bookings every hour or five bookings every minute. Waymo has revealed, as well, that it's had over <a href="https://waymo.com/blog/2024/03/scaling-waymo-one-safely-across-four-cities-this-year/">one million rider-only trips</a> across four cities, including Austin, where it's currently offering limited rides to select members of the public.</p>
<p>In its announcement, Waymo credited its &quot;safe and deliberate approach&quot; to scaling its program for reaching the milestone. &quot;We see p

## Doctor Who: The Devil’s Chord review: Is this madness?

<p><strong><em>The following includes spoilers for “The Devil’s Chord.”</em></strong></p>
<p>For a show about time (and space) travel interwoven with British pop culture since its start in 1963, a trip to visit the Beatles is an obvious premise. So obvious that this is the <a href="https://www.bigfinish.com/releases/v/doctor-who-1963-fanfare-for-the-common-men-716">second time</a> we’ve had a “what if” episode hinging on the Fab Four’s cultural impact. After all, both the Beatles and <em>Doctor Who</em> became global cultural exports as Britain flexed its post-imperial soft power. But while there’s plenty of material to mine in that premise, this isn’t an episode that’s interested in doing that, relegating the Beatles to little more than window dressing.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This has always been a trick in <em>Doctor Who’s </em>toolbox, especially when Russell T. Davies is in charge. He loves dangling an idea, or eye-catching visual, to lure in an audience befo

## Doctor Who Space Babies review: Bet you didn’t expect that

<p><strong><em>The following includes spoilers for “Space Babies.”</em></strong></p>
<p>You can’t help but admire Russell T. Davies’ audacity. He plucks the rights to make<em> Doctor Who</em> from the BBC. He gets Disney+ to write an enormous check to bring the show to life in a way never before attempted. Then, with so much money at stake and a months-long promotional campaign, he opens season one and the door to new fans with<em> this.</em></p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>We kick off at the end of “The Church on Ruby Road,” with the Doctor's latest companion, Ruby Sunday (Millie Gibson), entering the TARDIS for the first time. The Doctor introduces himself and offers a quick run-through of the premise for the folks at home. They’re an alien, adopted by the Time Lords of Gallifrey who were then wiped out. That leaves the Doctor (once again) as the last of their kind; a quasi-immortal time traveler who can go anywhere in the universe.</p>
