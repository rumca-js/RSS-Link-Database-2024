Currently my stack is mainly arr's and jellyfin secured with traefik and authelia on docker compose files proxied by free tier oracle (CGNAT sucks). I've tried proxmox once, but i got overwhelmed by the options it gives. I've always wanted to try it so much for stuff like: K8s, Testing systems, faster/cleaner reinstalls of my main stack if i fuck up, etc. 1. Is there a dynamic resource management? 2. If not, how do you know how many ram/cores to give each vm? 3. How would then traefik work? 4. Will i be able to proxy other vm's as well? 5. Should it be on a vm/container or host machine? 6. How would it work for anti-ddos for example? Or maybe should i stay on pure debian bcs it would not be worth the effort?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/kukubaorch\"> /u/kukubaorch ", "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1cuxvrl/should_i_or_how_to_move_to_proxmox", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/.rss", "source_obj__id": 450, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Should I or How to move to proxmox?", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-05-18T12:58:34+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I use Nextcloud as my personal data storage.
