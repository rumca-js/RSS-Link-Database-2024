This means no text-only top-level comments.</p></li> <li><p>It must be an original cartoon. This means no photographs, no edited cartoons, no AI generated images, no templates, no memes and no image macros. OC is allowed, as is animation.</p></li> <li><p>Each top-level comment should only have a maximum of 3 cartoons. </p></li> </ol> <p>That's all.
