Royel Otis interview in The Current studio

Through a family friendship, Leroy Bressington and Otis Pavlovic have at the very least known each other all their lives, but it wasn’t until they properly met at a bar that they started connecting about their shared love of music. Demos soon followed, and now the Sydney-based Royel Otis — the band name derived from their first names — find themselves embarking on their first U.S. tour. 

While in the Twin Cities, Royel Otis visited The Current studio to play acoustic versions of their songs and to talk with host Bill DeVille about their experience in the U.S. so far and about the recording of their first full-length album, Pratts & Pain.
