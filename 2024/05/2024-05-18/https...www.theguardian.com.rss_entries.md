<ul><li>Californian Schauffele looking for his first major</li><li>Shane Lowry races up leaderboard with a 62</li></ul><p>It was only going to take something special to switch discussion around this US PGA Championship away from Scottie Scheffler and his brush with Louisville law enforcement. The world No 1 unravelled on day three here, which was entirely understandable given the strain associated with four charges, including one for assaulting a police officer.</p><p>Shane Lowry took it upon himself to create a fresh and uplifting storyline. The Irishman stood on Valhalla’s 18th green over a putt of 11ft 6in which could have created history. If he found the bottom of the cup with his birdie attempt, he would have posted the first 61 in major history.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/may/19/morikawa-and-schauffele-end-third-day-of-us-pga-at-top-as-lowry-equals-record">Continue reading...</a>

In Ian Rankin’s noirish crime novels, Detective Sergeant John Rebus is an antihero to whom booze, fags and violence are key. Within a few minutes of the new BBC One dramatisation, the Edinburgh copper – played by Richard Rankin, no relation – has ticked off two of those three old-fashioned vices, flicking his tab to the tarmac before seriously assaulting a suspect. That the wrong’un whose skull is cracked is Rebus’s gangster nemesis Ger Cafferty (Stuart Bowman) suggests that this Rebus will please fans of the seamy books.</p><p>This, however, is a younger Rebus, still just a sergeant, but operating in the present day: screenwriter Gregory Burke plucks themes and characters from the literary timeline, as the fancy takes him.

<p>No manager has combined heart and soul with details and hard maths like the German, no wonder he has run out of energy</p><p>“I am, how can I say it, running out of energy.” It is, in its own way, the saddest of managerial farewells.

His energy is his <em>energy</em>, both in the tactical pattern of his teams and as a sustained feat of personality.</p><p>Throughout the Klopp elegies of the past few weeks, the deep-dives and unpeelings, the endless daily Klopp-trap, it is striking how little that decision has been questioned. The idea of an energy-free-Klopp is just so final, like José Mourinho telling you he’s run out of toxic bile, or Pep Guardiola confessing that, actually, he’s starting to find detailed positional strategy a little samey and humdrum these days.

<p>Spaniard has added individual flourish to collective duty in an evolution that is key to Manchester City’s success</p><p>Rodri was pretty young when he realised that he saw football in a different way to others. It wasn’t just his ability to pick a pass on the field, but the way he conceived the game off it. When he watched, he instinctively saw spaces and movement and only later realised that everyone else was simply following the ball. Football became not so much a pastime as a puzzle: a mechanism to be decrypted and understood.</p><p>As a child, making his way through the youth teams of Atlético Madrid, his father would urge him to get forward more, to score goals and make assists, to be more selfish. But Rodri always demurred. It was not that he was entirely selfless or free of ego. He understood freedom and fun, responsibility and reciprocity in a different way to most other players. Watching him today, seeing the trajectory his career has taken, allows us to do the same.</p>

<p>Manchester City’s hopes of winning the Barclays WSL for the first time in eight years ended in despair at Villa Park. Despite a 2-1 victory on the final day, Gareth Taylor’s side fell at the final hurdle as Chelsea clinched their fifth consecutive league title on goal difference. Mary Fowler opened the scoring before Rachel Daly equalised in the second half. Lauren Hemp poked home the winner late on but it was too little too late as far as the winning the league was concerned.</p><p>Manchester City have impressed this season with their notable consistency and goalscoring prowess. Those eye-catching winning streaks, however, will do little to console Taylor’s team who fell short in the final couple of weeks. They will continue to rue the stoppage-time loss to Arsenal just a fortnight previous that gave Chelsea a second chance in the run-in and, on this sunny afternoon in Birmingham, they struggled to put away their chances against a resilient Aston Villa.</p> <a href="https://www.th

<p>Ending this shortsighted and unfair policy would lift half a million children out of poverty immediately, says Martyn Snow</p><p>In Leicester, where I live and work as bishop, two in five children now live in poverty. That’s 12 pupils in every classroom struggling to focus. Some haven’t eaten breakfast. Others are no doubt worried about arguments they have overheard at home about money, and how to afford next year’s school uniform. When I visit our local schools, I hear of teachers bringing in food for pupils who would otherwise go hungry and schools covering the costs of trips to protect children from the shame of being left out. I’m hugely proud of all that our churches do to support those in need, whether it’s with holiday clubs or food hubs. But we cannot by ourselves reverse the trend of growing child poverty seen across the country. One policy change, however, could: ending the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jul/16/two-child-benefit-cap-explainer">two-child

<p>Tal Danino’s day job at Columbia University, New York, is engineering “living” medicines. “We program microbes for cancer therapy using synthetic biology,” he says. As a side hustle he manipulates and photographs the microbial world; his images are collected in a book, Beautiful Bacteria. Taking bacteria from substances such as wastewater, dental plaque or kimchi, Danino lets them multiply in a petri dish, adding dyes. The results are artworks differing from the digital enhancements often made in scientific photography to make images more informative. Indeed, he says, the microbes deserve some credit: “They do often deviate from our plans, becoming active collaborators in the creation of the work.” <br /><br /><em>Beautiful Bacteria: Encounters in the Microuniverse</em> is published by Rizzoli (£38.50).

There were, though, one or two dissenting voices, who accused me of “excessive sentiment” and asked whether the desire to rebuild the building has “got anything to do with what art might be, needs to be, in the 21st century”? To which I’d say, if the art of the present would benefit from generous, adaptable and well-lit studios, such as the old building had, and proximity to some of the greatest design of the past, then yes, it does.

<p>A core of players have seen all or most of Pep Guardiola’s Etihad tenure and are on the verge of a sixth title winner’s medal</p><p>It takes a lot for Pep Guardiola to trust unconditionally, so staying the course with the Manchester City manager is not a straightforward business. Despite the constant trophies gleaming in the Etihad cabinet, decorated players have come and gone – but six have the chance of securing a sixth Premier League title alongside Guardiola on Sunday afternoon.</p><p>Ederson, Kyle Walker, John Stones, Kevin De Bruyne, Bernardo Silva and Phil Foden have set the tone for much of the club’s success. A victory over West Ham will guarantee each a sixth winner’s medal, putting them on par with David Beckham and Phil Neville. De Bruyne was already a City first-teamer when Guardiola arrived in Manchester in 2016, while Foden was making headway in the academy. The other four were carefully selected by the club’s hierarchy and Guardiola.</p> <a href="https://www.theguar

<p>League Two playoff finalists’ American owners endured the jeers but beating Crewe would prompt tears not triumphalism</p><p>Preston Johnson has been to Wembley before. “I saw Coldplay in concert once,” the American recalls.

<p>When those sunny days arrive, this caramelised aubergine and pasta bowl ticks all the boxes for spending less time in the kitchen</p><p>Around this time of year, when the sun starts to pop out a bit more, I like my meals to be more sympathetic to my plan to spend as much time outdoors as possible. To do that, they need to be able to (mainly) cook themselves and be eaten, with a bowl in one hand and a fork in the other, while I perch on a garden chair.

Michael Hughes gave West Ham the lead in the first half as Alan Shearer scored his 34th goal of the season at Anfield but when Brian McClair and then John Barnes equalised, suddenly United had hope. Jamie Redknapp fulfilled Liverpool’s end of the bargain by scoring from a late free-kick that was greeted with silence from the home crowd.

Children who have lost their trust in humans can find it in horses, which neither threaten nor judge them, then build on that relationship gradually to reconnect with people.</p><p>It’s an astonishing, inspiring thing to witness, as the children begin to calm, uncurl and find purpose and hope. It can have life-changing results.

After signing a three-year contract at the city’s Hope Street hotel, and before going for a drink with his family at a bar around the corner, Klopp gave his first interview as Liverpool’s manager. “The message to those Liverpool supporters?” he asks, rhetorically. “We have to change, from doubter to believer.

<p>A vivid cultural of digestion, from ancient Greece to All-Bran</p><p>Some people, observed Samuel Johnson, “have a foolish way of not minding, or pretending not to&nbsp;mind, what they eat. For my&nbsp;part, I&nbsp;mind my belly very studiously, and very carefully; for I&nbsp;look upon it, that he who does not mind his belly, will hardly mind anything else.” And while&nbsp;we are minding our belly, our belly minds us:&nbsp;so, at least, we are encouraged to think by modern hymns to the wisdom of the enteric nervous system and the gut microbiome, to which all manner of marvels are increasingly attributed.</p><p>Here, then, is a book-length exercise in minding the belly: a vivid cultural history of changing metaphorical, political and scientific visions of our guts. The stomach is a-flutter when we&nbsp;are in love, and the way to a man’s&nbsp;heart is through his stomach, though not for laparoscopic surgeons. (That phrase was apparently coined by&nbsp;the 19th-century American journ

These are images of people making a picture of themselves for future eyes, including mine, and their hopefulness makes me nostalgic. My granny is also accidentally included in a portrait of my mother’s dog, taken out in the garden. There she is in the background, scrubbing away at something in a zinc tub.

<p>TV presenter and naturalist Steve Backshall finds a camper truck the ideal way to give children an outdoors experience in untamed parts of northern England</p><p>Camping trips with a young family can be thoroughly challenging, especially in the UK, when the weather often skips from sunshine to deluge in the blink of an eye. My extra challenge is that my wife, Helen, can’t join us for our Easter break (she’s away training for her fourth Olympic Games – reasonable excuse). My three kids (twins of four, and an older brother not quite six) are a tornado handful at the best of times. I definitely don’t want to be flying abroad with them, but I want to give them a memorable wild outdoors experience.

<p>Salted caramel made with bacon fat? Surely not! Then again, whyever not?</p><p>Bacon fat has a unique, rounded, umami-rich flavour that works well in both sweet and savoury dishes, so always be sure to save any left over after cooking, and make sure you scrape the bottom of the pan to get all those flavourful, caramelised bacony bits. Bacon fat makes just about any dish more mouthwatering, and turbo-charges it with flavour: use it for sauteing potatoes, frying chicken or, if you fancy stepping up your dessert game, making today’s bacon fat salted caramel. I love it drizzled over popcorn or pancakes, though my favourite is to use it as a topping for vanilla ice-cream. Also, you don’t even need to use any salt, because the fat alone gives the caramel a good, salty twang.</p><p>Discover this recipe and many more from your favourite cooks in <a href="https://app.adjust.com/1bgiux9n?creative=Endnotes&amp;fallback=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fhelp%2Finsideguardian%2F2024%2Fapr%2F1
