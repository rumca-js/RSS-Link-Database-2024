## Sugar’s big twist was more than a gimmick

  <p id="TMNhUy">For most of its first season, <em>Sugar </em>on Apple TV Plus was a fairly typical if slickly produced detective story. It starred Colin Farrell as John Sugar, a private investigator with a number of charming quirks — obsessed with old movies, unable to get drunk, beloved by dogs — who was determined to solve a missing persons case involving the granddaughter of a famous Hollywood director. Then, at the end of episode six, the show introduced a twist that threatened to change it into something very different. But now that <em>Sugar</em>’s finale is out, it’s clear that the twist didn’t alter what the show already was — it just added some new flavor.</p>
