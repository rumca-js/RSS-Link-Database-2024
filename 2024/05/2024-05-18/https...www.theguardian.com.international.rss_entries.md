## Why is social media getting all churned up about cottage cheese? | Rachel Cooke

<p>After being promoted by US bloggers and Instagram, cottage cheese sales are now up 40% in the UK. Its blandness is befitting of the times</p><p>While I didn’t see the cottage-cheese craze coming – who could ever have predicted this pineapple-chunk-inflected bout of collective madness? – now it’s here, I find myself strangely fascinated by it. In one sense, of course, its ascendancy is utterly banal: another creation of social media (its new popularity may be traced originally to TikTok), it can’t be long before the buffet moves on, maybe in the direction of luncheon meat or tinned mandarins. But on the other hand, it’s still deeply weird, especially to those of us who last ate cottage cheese three decades ago, and then only in extremis (as a student, I sometimes kept an emergency pot cooling on the window ledge of my college room for those piercing moments of youthful crisis when I had no time to eat properly).</p><p>Like a mushroom, this trend sprouted last year, seemingly overnig

## You think Parisians grumble a lot? Don’t get them started on the Olympic Games | Robert McLiam Wilson

<p>From price rises to a ridiculous mascot, the French have had it up <br />to here with the event</p><p></p><p>We tend to view Paris as a fairytale princess, all romance and half-seen glitter. But for all its glamour, Paris has actually been depressed and irritable for a couple of hundred years now.</p><p>Far from being subdued by it, the citizens of Paris wear this perma-gloom like a disconsolate badge of honour. More tightly packed than in any housing estate high-rise, Parisians lead their stressed, underpaid lives defiantly. They mock and complain. They rail and grumble. Unlike anywhere I’ve ever known, in this city, if you say something nice about the place, the citizens disdainfully correct you. Paris doesn’t believe it is the best place. It just knows everywhere else is worse.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/may/18/you-think-parisians-grumble-a-lot-dont-get-them-started-on-the-olympic-games">Continue reading...</a>

## Jasmine Myra: Rising review – gently insistent jazz

<p>(Gondwana)<br />The alto saxophonist leans into her soft and subtle sound with newfound confidence on this second album</p><p>With the release of her 2022 debut album, <em>Horizons</em><em>, </em>saxophonist <a href="https://jasminemyra.com/">Jasmine Myra</a> became a breakout star of the UK jazz scene. Weaving soft and subtle alto saxophone lines through compositions that paired luscious harmonies with snapping rhythms, Myra showcased her skill as a composer rather than an instrumental virtuoso. On her second album, she continues to produce this gently insistent sound, now leaning further into her capabilities as a soloist.</p><p>The opening, title track<em> </em>evokes a Kenny Garrett-style ensemble harmony before picking up the pace to frame Myra’s keening and emotive solo. Still Waters continues this theme, slowly developing an undulating flute and bass motif that underpins a sax solo of longing, elongated phrases. The group compositions are still fully realised, with tracks li

<p>The 20-year failed romance between a singer and a dodgy music promoter becomes the vehicle for director Jia Zhangke’s latest exploration of China’s momentous recent history</p><p>As so often in the past, Chinese film-maker Jia Zhangke swims down into an ocean of sadness and strangeness; his new film is a mysterious quest narrative with a dynamic, westernised musical score. It tells a human story of a failed romance spanning 20 years, and brings this into parallel with a larger panorama: the awe-inspiring scale of millennial change that has transformed China in the same period, a futurist fervour for quasi-capitalist innovation that has turned out to co-exist with some very old-fashioned state coercion.</p><p>Caught by the Tides reflects with a kind of numb astonishment at all the novelties that the country has been required to welcome, all the vast upheavals for which the people have had to make sacrifices. The film shows us the mobster-businessmen who have done well in modern Chin

<p>For the first time in history, three women’s Olympic all-around champions, Gabby Douglas, Simone Biles and Sunisa Lee, will compete in the same even on Saturday at the US Classic</p><p>There was once a time, not long ago, when the women’s Olympic all-around champion’s triumphant week was also likely to be the last time they ever appeared in an international competition. If their tireless journey to the summit of their sport had not left deep physical or mental scars, then the perception of women’s gymnastics as a sport for teenagers would keep them from investing their time in another run. Between 1980 and 2016, not a single Olympic women’s all-around champion gymnast returned to compete at another Olympic games.</p><p>This is a time of change in women’s artistic gymnastics, though, and the US Classic in Hartford, Connecticut, this weekend is testament to how many more gymnasts are enjoying longer, fuller careers.
