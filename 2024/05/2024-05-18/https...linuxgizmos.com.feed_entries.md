M5Stack Launches Low-Cost 433MHz &#038; 868MHz LoRa Modules
M5Stack has launched two new LoRa Modules in 433MHz and 868MHz versions, designed to enhance long-range wireless communication for IoT applications. Using the Ra-02 module with Semtech's SX1278 chip, these modules excel in remote control, smart city infrastructure, and industrial automation where standard networks are inadequate.
