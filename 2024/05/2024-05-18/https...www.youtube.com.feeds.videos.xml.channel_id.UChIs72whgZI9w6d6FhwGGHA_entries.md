ASUS responded -- again -- to our coverage. The last time they did this was the same day last year, but for motherboards. This time, ASUS has responded about its warranty process in general. Unfortunately, the company has, we think, misrepresented the timeline and accused its customers of being "confused" in a tonedeaf response. Rather than just post the improvement plan, the company had to take shots at its own customers in the process.

In this episode, we're joined by attorney Vincent Agost
