<p><a href="https://github.com/simonw/count-ai">AI counter app from my PyCon US keynote</a></p>
In my keynote at PyCon US this morning I ran a counter at the top of my screen that automatically incremented every time I said the words "AI" or "artificial intelligence", using <a href="https://alphacephei.com/vosk/">vosk</a>, <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/pyaudio/">pyaudio</a> and Tkinter. I wrote it in a few minutes with <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/58f2352d-1f17-495b-94f1-4eb44cd574b9">the help of GPT-4o</a> - here's the code I ran as a GitHub repository.</p>
<p>I'll publish full detailed notes from my talk once the video is available on YouTube.
