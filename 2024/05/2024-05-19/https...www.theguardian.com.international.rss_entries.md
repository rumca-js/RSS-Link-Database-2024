<ul><li>Indiana Pacers 130-109 New York Knicks</li><li>Pacers advance with historic shooting performance</li><li>Knicks hit hard by injuries as they crash out</li></ul><p>Tyrese Haliburton scored 26 points and the Indiana Pacers rode one of the most sensational first halves in Game 7 history to a 130-109 victory over the New York Knicks on Sunday, advancing to the Eastern Conference finals for the first time in 10 years.</p><p>The Pacers made 29 of their 38 shots in the first half, a shooting percentage of 76.3%.

<p>A seventh title in 10 years is proof of how incredible wealth has eroded any sense of competitive balance in the Premier League </p><p>Once more, without feeling. The sun rose on Sunday morning, the Earth completed one full rotation around its axis, and Manchester City won the Premier League title, just as they did in 2012 and 2014, and 2018 and 2019, and 2021 and 2022 and 2023. One more trophy in the glass case, one more silhouette to add to the mural. The greatest saga in English football has been recast as church liturgy, its rhythms hardened into routine, and here Arsenal were simply the latest team to succumb to the myth that there was ever a race to be won.</p><p>For City there is of course a glorious familiarity to these rituals now, a muscle memory in those trophy‑bearing limbs, the arms that lift it and the legs that earn it. Of course there is the full‑scale invasion at full-time, which proceeds in contempt of the multiple big-screen warnings forbidding it, because by now

I love that this is the new “When I’m an old woman I shall wear purple”, when I’m an old woman I shall get my own bedroom, these women finding their voices, their sexuality, their freedom in their 50s, but it also highlights how, the world being the way it is, these versions of utopia are only available to the wealthy.</p><p>Who wouldn’t want their own house just so, their bathroom untouched by other feet, unlittered with half-empty bottles of Head &amp; Shoulders shampoo?
