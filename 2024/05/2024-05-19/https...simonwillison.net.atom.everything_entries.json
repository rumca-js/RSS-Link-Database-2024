The latest wave of AI behind the \u2018zombie internet\u2019</a></p>\nI'm quoted in this piece in the Guardian about slop:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I think having a name for this is really important, because it gives people a concise way to talk about the problem.</p>\n<p>Before the term \u2018spam\u2019 entered general use it wasn\u2019t necessarily clear to everyone that unwanted marketing messages were a bad way to behave. I\u2019m hoping \u2018slop\u2019 has the same impact \u2013 it can make it clear to people that generating and publishing unreviewed AI-generated content is bad behaviour.</p>\n</blockquote>", "language": "en-us", "link": "https://simonwillison.net/2024/May/19/spam-junk-slop-the-latest-wave-of-ai-behind-the-zombie-internet/#atom-everything", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://simonwillison.net/atom/everything", "source_obj__id": 423, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Spam, junk \u2026 slop?
