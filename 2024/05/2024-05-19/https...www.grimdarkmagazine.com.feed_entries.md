<p>Hammers on Bone by Cassandra Khaw is a rare gem in what I&#8217;ve always felt should have been a larger genre: the Cthulhu Mythos detective novel. I&#8217;ve played a few video games with the premise like Dark Corners of the Earth, The Sinking City, and Call of Cthulhu (2018) but I feel like it&#8217;s something that should have been as popular a genre in paperback fiction as the Dungeons and Dragons novel was in the Nineties. I feel like Chaosium and other parties could have made some serious bank on this and I&#8217;ve always wondered at that missed opportunity. Personally, my theory is that in addition to the nebulous status of Cthulhu copyright ownership, I also felt like there were people who felt that Pulpy fun &#8220;Tommy Guns and Two Fisted Action&#8221; Cthulhu playstyle was something that people in charge disdained. This despite the fact that I think it&#8217;s the absolute best way to play Call of Cthulhu and why I will always choose Pulp Cthulhu over its regular count
