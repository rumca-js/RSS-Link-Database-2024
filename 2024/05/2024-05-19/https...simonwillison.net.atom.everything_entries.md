I'm quoted in this piece in the Guardian about slop:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think having a name for this is really important, because it gives people a concise way to talk about the problem.</p>
<p>Before the term ‘spam’ entered general use it wasn’t necessarily clear to everyone that unwanted marketing messages were a bad way to behave. I’m hoping ‘slop’ has the same impact – it can make it clear to people that generating and publishing unreviewed AI-generated content is bad behaviour.</p>

<a href="https://groq.com/">Groq</a> is now serving LLMs such as Llama 3 so quickly that JavaScript which attempts to render Markdown strings on every new token can cause performance issues in browsers.</p>
<p>Taras Glek's <a href="https://github.com/tarasglek/chatcraft.org/pull/640/files">solution</a> was to move the rendering to a <code>requestAnimationFrame()</code> callback, effectively buffering the rendering to the fastest rate the browser can support.
