  <p id="hjWdTp">The Mac Studio and Mac Pro aren’t due for an upgrade to Apple’s M4 chip until the middle of next year. That means both machines will still be on Apple’s M2 generation this year, unlike all other Macs except the MacBook Air, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-05-19/what-is-apple-doing-in-ai-summaries-cloud-and-on-device-llms-openai-deal-lwdj5pkz?srnd=undefined"><em>Bloomberg</em>’s Mark Gurman wrote to <em>Power On</em> subscribers today</a><em>. </em></p>

  <p id="zeL0ku">Sonos is teasing, both in emails and on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C7JuZ-WuvQL/?hl=en">social media</a>, that its “most requested product ever” is “coming soon” on May 21st (this Tuesday). This, of course, is almost certainly the Sonos Ace, its first wireless headphones. </p>
