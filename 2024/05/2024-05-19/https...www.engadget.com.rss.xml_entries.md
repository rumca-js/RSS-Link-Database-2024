<p>The <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ipad-pro-2024-review-so-very-nice-and-so-very-expensive-210012937.html">new 13-inch M4 iPad Pro</a> is really, really thin. That’s inevitably going to make certain aspects of repairing the device even more difficult, which <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/96021/ipad-pro-13s-hide-a-repairability-win-still-hard-to-fix">iFixit</a> confirmed in a teardown published this weekend. But it does shine in one area — when it comes to replacing the battery, Apple made some seriously helpful changes.</p>
<p>“For the first time in an iPad Pro, we’re able to remove the battery immediately after removing the screen,” Teardown Tech Shahram Mokhtari wrote in a blog post. Mokhtari notes that “immediately is relative,” as there are still some screws and brackets to remove before the battery can be taken out, and the video documenting the process shows it takes a bit of work to get to the pull tabs beneath the

## Sam Altman is ‘embarrassed’ that OpenAI threatened to revoke equity if exiting employees wouldn’t sign an NDA

<p>OpenAI reportedly made exiting employees choose between keeping their vested equity and being able to speak out against the company. According to <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2024/5/17/24158478/openai-departures-sam-altman-employees-chatgpt-release"><em><ins>Vox</ins></em></a>, which viewed the document in question, employees could “lose all vested equity they earned during their time at the company, which is likely worth millions of dollars” if they didn’t sign a nondisclosure and non-disparagement agreement, thanks to a provision in the off-boarding papers. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman confirmed in a <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://x.com/sama/status/1791936857594581428"><ins>tweet</ins></a> on Saturday evening that such a provision did exist, but said “we have never clawed back anyone's vested equity, nor will we do that if people do not sign a separation agreement (or don't agree to a non-disparagement agreement).”</p>

<p>Blue Origin is back in the space tourism game. Jeff Bezos’ spaceflight company successfully flew six paying customers to the edge of space and back this morning, breaking its nearly two-year-long hiatus from crewed missions. This was Blue Origin’s seventh trip with humans on board. The mission — a quick jaunt to cross the Kármán line, or the boundary of space, about 62 miles above Earth — lifted off from the company’s Launch Site One in West Texas shortly after 10:30AM ET.</p>
<p>The six people inside the New Shepard crew capsule included 90-year-old Ed Dwight, a former Air Force Captain who was the first Black astronaut candidate when he was picked for the training program in 1961. He went through training but ultimately wasn’t selected for NASA’s Astronaut Corps, and never made it to space until now. Also on board were Mason Angel, Sylvain Chiron, Kenneth L. Hess, Carol Schaller and Gopi Thotakura. They were briefly able to unbuckle their seatbelts and experience zero gravity.</p

## Indie developers are trying to make horse games that don’t suck. It’s not easy

<p>Video game horses tend to play a fairly uncomplicated role, at least in mainstream titles. Like semi-sentient meat bicycles, they often exist as little more than a way to make the player travel faster, jump farther or occasionally <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://parryeverything.files.wordpress.com/2023/08/skyrimhorse1.gif">defy the laws of physics</a>. With the exception of <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>, an outlier beloved for its equine verisimilitude and breadth of riding-related activities, horses in video games are generally emotionless props, notorious for janky animations and unnatural anatomy.</p>
<p>That’s fine for most players’ needs, but for those who are drawn to certain games in part <em>because </em>they have horses, there's a lot to be desired. Especially since the alternatives — dedicated horse games — haven’t proven to be much better. The genre is plagued with shoddy graphics, unoriginal storylines and drawn-out, repetitive caretaking tasks like hoof-pic
