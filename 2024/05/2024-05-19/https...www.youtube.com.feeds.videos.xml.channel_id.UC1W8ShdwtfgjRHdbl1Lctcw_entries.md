I colorized, restored and created a sound design for this video of  Reno, Nevada 1952, Includes shots of downtown, Club Cal-Neva, Ramona's kitchen, Roaring Camp, and several vintage cars. There's a close-up of a Southern Pacific wigwag crossing signal, and people waiting for a passenger train at the Reno depot. Passenger train, scenes from the Palace Club, Wine House and Rolo Casino. Other shots are taken from the train along the Truckee River, Truckee Station and Donner Lake.


Video Restoration Process:
✔ FPS boosted to 60 frames per second 
✔ Image resolution boosted up to HD 
✔ Improved video sharpness and brightness 
✔ Colorized only for the ambiance (not historically accurate)
