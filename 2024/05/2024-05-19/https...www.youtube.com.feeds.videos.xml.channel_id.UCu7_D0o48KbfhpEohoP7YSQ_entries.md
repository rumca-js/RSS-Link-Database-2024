When I made my videos about LoRaWAN, some viewers asked if it would replace conventional Wi-Fi with a much bigger range. Unfortunately, this was not the case because LoRa has a huge range but a minimal throughput. It seems somebody listened to them and invented Wi-Fi on the same frequency band as LoRaWAN using Wi-Fi protocols. Cool. In this video, we will check it out to see if it can keep its promises, like going through walls and having a more than 1-kilometer range. We will compare it to standard Wi-Fi and learn that we must pay attention to staying legal.
