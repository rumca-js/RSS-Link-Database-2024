A magician meets his match (physics) while performing a buried alive stunt.


"1990: Escape artist Joseph W. "Amazing Joe" Burrus died on Halloween when the glass 'coffin' he was attempting to escape from collapsed under the weight of wet cement poured on top of it. Burrus died on the 64th anniversary of the death of Harry Houdini, who was Burrus' inspiration for the performance."
