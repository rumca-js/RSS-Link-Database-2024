<ul><li>American makes a birdie at final hole to claim a first major</li><li>Bryson DeChambeau second on -20; Victor Hovland third</li></ul><p>It seemed appropriate that this staging of the US PGA Championship played out in the home city of Muhammad Ali. Viktor Hovland swung and missed at Xander Schauffele all afternoon. Bryson DeChambeau, with typical force, did likewise. Schauffele is golf’s nearly man no more. He withstood immense pressure to claim the Wanamaker Trophy.</p><p>Bare statistics disguise epic sporting theatre during what quickly became a three-horse sprint. Schauffele, at 21 under par, saw off DeChambeau by one. Hovland, such an integral part of the Valhalla story, closed at minus 18.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/may/20/xander-schauffele-pips-dechambeau-by-one-shot-to-win-us-pga-championship">Continue reading...</a>

But it somehow doesn’t establish anything exciting for its various unresolved storylines, and doesn’t leave us suspensefully hanging for anything else.<br /><br />In fact, the ploddingly paced epic ends by suddenly accelerating into a very peculiar preview montage of part two, with Costner speeding around punching people we’ve never seen before – as if someone had accidentally leant on the fast-forward button and we got to watch the whole of the second section in 25 seconds.<br /><br />It certainly starts at a gallop.

<p>For just a few seconds, the miracle that Mikel Arteta and all Arsenal fans so craved seemed as if it might actually happen. As Takehiro Tomiyasu was slamming home an emphatic equaliser against Everton, rumours that West Ham had scored a second goal to peg back Manchester City began to sweep through the Emirates Stadium.</p><p>Having surprisingly found themselves trailing to Idrissa Gueye’s free kick that deflected off the head of the unfortunate Declan Rice, suddenly Arsenal had hope of ending their 20-year wait to become Premier League champions. But after a campaign in which they have almost matched Pep Guardiola’s side stride for stride, the brutal reality that City simply do not falter at the final hurdle was made clear when news of Rodri’s decisive third goal <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/may/19/manchester-city-beat-west-ham-to-win-fourth-premier-league-title-in-a-row">that sealed their unprecedented fourth straight title</a> was confirmed just bef

<p>Pep Guardiola had predicted that he and Manchester City would suffer; it would be emotional, the nerves stretched taut because this is how it is supposed to go on the final day of the Premier League season when so much is at stake.</p><p>It had been that way, of course, in 2022 when City needed to beat Aston Villa here in the last game. They were 2-0 down with 15 minutes to play, flirting aggressively with disaster before the Ilkay Gündogan-inspired comeback for 3-2. City have previous for doing things the hard way. And not only in the Aguerooo season.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/may/19/manchester-city-beat-west-ham-to-win-fourth-premier-league-title-in-a-row">Continue reading...</a>

It was a delirium that took her, as it did many people, a little by surprise, not least because she in theory belonged to this subsection herself: at school, where she was for a while the only out gay person, she ran around sticking rainbows all over the place; after college she was known to go to readings at Verso Books (“my God, I bought a tote”); when her girl Hillary was “about to win” she was “drinking with I’m With Her-icanes at a drag bar”.

Limonov (a pen name taken from the Russian word “limonka”, meaning lime but also slang for grenade) became an angry bohemian, a sexual outlaw, a celebrated <em>adulte terrible</em> in French literary circles in the 80s, railing against the prissy liberals and mincing hypocrites. Then he returned to Russia and became the leader of a violent group called the National Bolshevik Party. Tactfully, nobody here points out the simil

<p>The novelist’s love triangle has its sights set on the elite insularity of the New York art world but its plot is programmatic</p><p>I’ve always admired Hari Kunzru’s novels for their dense, satirical plunge into subcultures.

Mike Frame, the protagonist of <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/sep/02/fiction.features3">My Revolutions</a></em> (2007), may be living the “rich person’s fantasy” of a country life with his spouse and stepdaughter at the turn of the millennium, but once upon a time he went by a different name and was involved too deep with a militant ultra-left activist group in the late 1960s and early 70s. <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/03/white-tears-hari-kunzru-fiction-books-review-provocative-tale-of-morality-the-blues">White Tears</a></em> explored the American popular music scene, with t

She blames digital platforms supplanting young people’s in-person, “IRL” experiences, leading to stunted social development.

<p>Mum added it to pretty much everything and I start every day with ginger and hot water</p><p>I should be a ginger spokesperson – I love it in every form. My all-time favourite is stem ginger. It’s underused in baking although not by me. One bulb will be quite zingy, but if you grate or finely dice half a bulb and mix it through a standard vanilla sponge mix, it adds a nice level of warmth. You can use the syrup as a glaze. I have a recipe for a sticky-toffee, self-saucing pudding that has chocolate and stem ginger in the sauce.</p><p>I grew up having ground ginger in curries, with my mum adding it to pretty much everything. You can add fresh ginger to curry bases as well, which gives a different flavour profile. I always keep root ginger in the freezer, never in the fridge, so it lasts longer. And whether a dish is sweet or savoury, I’ll always grate it straight in, using a very fine grater. It is a good way of introducing the flavour without it being too “bitty” or risk someone bi

Brian Clough? Bill Shankly? Since arriving at Liverpool in 2015, Klopp has revived the fortunes of a club that had for too long been trading on past glories, bringing with him a thrilling style of play he has himself described as “heavy metal football”. So there was a palpable sense of shock when, in January, he announced that at the end of the season he would be <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/jan/26/jurgen-klopp-to-step-down-as-liverpool-manager-at-end-of-season">leaving the club</a> and taking a break from football.</p><p>The reverberations from Klopp’s decision to step down have been felt far beyond those for whom <em><a href="https://jobsinfootball.com/blog/tactics/what-is-gegenpressing/">Gegenpressing</a></em> is a familia

<p>Who will take over the family drug business? Cue violence, treachery and too much shouting</p><p>The future of a south London crime family hangs in the balance. Mick Roman (Gary Webster), the cool head controlling a viper’s nest of warring egos, is gravely ill. But the question of succession in the family business (mostly drugs, some violence, lots of shouting) is hotly contested. Mick’s son Jimmy (Charlie Clapham) assumes he’s a cert, but his adopted brother Henry (Michael Head, who also directs) disagrees. And that’s before you factor in the treacherous women of the Roman family. This crime comedy has plenty of energy, as expected from a film that seems to be largely powered by cocaine, but it’s erratic and rather grating.</p><p>In UK and Irish cinemas now</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/article/2024/may/19/bermondsey-tales-fall-of-the-roman-empire-review-fast-and-furious-caper-michael-head">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘The insults and screaming took their toll’: the worst time of my life as a chef

If you’re a chef, it’s likely someone will have screamed them in your face at least once. For me, it happened at a restaurant I don’t include on my CV. I have never admitted that I worked for this chef in interviews and rarely speak about my experience, even to friends and family. Because I don’t want to trash someone’s reputation for the sake of my own, I’m not going to use the real name of the restaurant or of anyone who worked there. However, people need to understand that places like this exist, and that the experience was formative, if awful. So, le

Now, thanks to the adult son of Blandine, who worries that his divorced mother is in danger of closing herself off from the world, the pair are reunited and find themselves embarking on the trip they dreamed of as teenagers: to the Greek island of Amorgos, location of the film <em>The Big Blue</em>. Except that, owing to erratic nightmare Magalie, they are kicked off the ferry for fare-dodging on to another island.</p><p><em>Two Tickets to Greece</em> has some

<p>It’s the season of salads, so a good dressing is a must </p><p>The dressing I make most often is a simple vinaigrette with vinegar, olive oil, a dash of smooth mustard and salt and pepper. I give it only the faintest breath of garlic, the clove left to steep in the vinegar for 10 minutes to take out its sting. I use a workaday olive oil rather than something more peppery or fruity, shaking everything up in a tightly sealed jar. I could make it in my sleep.</p><p>Sometimes, a slightly more aromatic dressing is called for: one with shredded basil and sherry vinegar for tomatoes; or with the merest hint of honey for bitter leaves, such as watercress or chicory or with mint and tarragon to marry with roasted aubergines or courgettes. A dressing to flatter the fresh ingredients, not mask them. A light, uplifting lotion to tease out the flavours of the ingredients rather than one that smothers. A dressing to bring harmony and balance. It is what makes a few, well-chosen leaves special en

<p>Our desires are an essential part of who we are – as I discovered when I lost my appetite for six months</p><p>Mostly, walking down New York streets in spring sunshine is the cinematic, euphoric ideal of what it is to be alive. It’s the thing I looked forward to for decades. It meant to me, back then as a kid in Ireland, listening to songs about Lexington and 14th Street, freedom: an almost deranged amount of freedom.</p><p>Sometimes, though, walking down New York streets in spring sunshine is agonising in both a physical and spiritual sense. This may be so, for instance, if you have no health insurance and are very stupid. Like me. That was in February 2023. I had been in increasingly acute pain for days, but because of a stubborn ability to ignore bodily breakdown and also a reluctance to spend money on healthcare in the US when I was only visiting, I kept going until I collapsed into an urgent care centre that I luckily passed one evening as I was dragging myself with manic good

But the story too often takes precedence over the art</p><p>Mary Delany (1700-88) was a witty memoirist of 72 when she in effect invented the paper collage in Britain. Noticing the affinity between a geranium and a scrap of red paper, she took her scissors and cut a petal from it freehand. The exquisite plant that grew from Delany’s work looked so exactly like a watercolour people mistook it for a painting. She had discovered a new way, she wrote to her niece, “<a href="https://www.britishmuseum.org/blog/late-bloomer-exquisite-craft-mary-delany">of imitating flowers</a>”.</p><p>Delany’s collages are startlingly beautiful – nearly transparent apparitions materialising on inky black paper.

She did not see her parents – eventually sent by Russian forces, separately, to detention camps in Siberia – for another 20 years. The separation, she later said, gave her a profound sense of impermanence; the Leica felt like one antidote to that: “The photograph fulfils my deep need to stop things from disappearing,” she wrote. “It makes transience less painful.”</p><p>Over her long life – Bohm <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/mar/27/dorothy-bohm-

Burgundy, the grape variety’s original, and still its spiritual, home, is the main culprit: so many of the region’s magical red wines that I might once have occasionally bought, albeit as a treat, are now completely out of reach unless I come up trumps on the postcode lottery or land a late-career job in finance. But it’s not just Burgundy. Almost all my favourite New World pinot regions (the Yarra Valley in Australia; Central Otago in New Zealand, California’s Santa Rita Hills) command a premium that consistently takes the best wines close to three figures and beyond.
