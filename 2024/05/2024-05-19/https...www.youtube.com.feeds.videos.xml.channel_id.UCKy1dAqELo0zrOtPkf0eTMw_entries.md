A Better Paradise Volume One: An Aftermath is an audio fiction series created by Absurd Ventures, the new company founded by storytellers behind Red Dead Redemption and Grand Theft Auto. The series is also developed in partnership with QCODE Media.

A Better Paradise Volume One: An Aftermath stars Andrew Lincoln, Shamier Anderson, Paterson Joseph, Rain Spencer, and more. 

The 12-episode original audio fiction series launches on June 10 on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Amazon Music, and wherever podcasts are available.
