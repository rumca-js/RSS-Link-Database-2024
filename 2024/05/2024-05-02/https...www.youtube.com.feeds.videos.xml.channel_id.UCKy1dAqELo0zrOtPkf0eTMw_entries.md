Check out action-packed gameplay set in a devastated world in this new The Forever Winter trailer for the upcoming squad-based, tactical survival horror looter-shooter game with rogue-like elements, where you fight to survive against gigantic war machines.

In The Forever Winter, players enter a maze of relentless PvEvE conflict, with various ever-present enemy factions fighting to achieve their own objectives. Squads of up to four players (or AI-driven squadmates) face off against (or sneak by) hordes of colossal enemies and loot the fallen in a desperate race to secure what’s left of Earth’s dwindling resources. Scavenge what you need, then be ready to run like hell or face an inevitably bloody demise. Building your arsenal over multiple play-throughs gives you a fighting chance against bigger and badder enemies… but you’ll never stop the war. You’ll never “win.” In The Forever Winter, winning is staying alive and returning home with supplies for your crew.
