<p>Microsoft has introduced TypeSpec, a language for API-centric development.</p><p><a href="https://typespec.io/blog/2024-04-25-introducing" rel="nofollow">Unveiled April 25</a>, TypeSpec is designed to meet the needs of API developers, managers, and architects in an environment where delivering high-quality APIs and related experiences has become increasingly critical and complex, Microsoft said. The company described TypeSpec as a lightweight language that describes APIs using any protocol or serialization format and encapsulates common data types, API patterns, and API guidelines into high level, reusable components. It can define complex data and API shapes with minimal types. </p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3715326/microsoft-unveils-typespec-language-for-api-development.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>

Done poorly, RAI initiatives stymie innovation, creating hurdles that add delays and costs without actually improving safety.

<p>Developers often need to perform programming operations such as retrieving the current date, manipulating dates, and formatting dates in their applications. While Java's traditional <code>java.util.Calendar</code> class had its day, the newer <code>LocalDate</code> class does more with significantly fewer lines of code. This article introduces you to <code>LocalDate</code> and the <code>java.time</code> API for using dates, times, and durations in your programs.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: Introduced in Java 8, <code>java.time</code> standardizes many elements of the popular <a href="https://www.joda.org/joda-time/" rel="nofollow">Joda-Time library</a>. Concepts introduced here can be applied to either library but the JDK standard is generally recommended.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3715403/replace-calendar-with-localdate-in-java-programs.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>

<p>How do we ensure that the code we’re installing is, at the very least, the code that a vendor shipped? The generally accepted solution is code signing, adding a digital signature to binaries that can be used to ensure authorship. At the same time, the signature includes a hash that can be used to show that the code you’ve received hasn’t been altered after it’s been signed.</p><p>Code signing is increasingly important as part of ensuring software bills of materials and reducing the risks associated with malware hijacking legitimate binaries. Signing is necessary if you’re planning on using services like the Microsoft Store or the Windows Package Manager to distribute your applications, allowing the repository to verify software sources.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3715424/understanding-microsofts-trusted-signing-service.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>
