YA movies were all the rage in the early 2010s, but a strange thing happened where those young adults… aged? It seems like the even younger adults did not share the same enthusiasm for the genre, and nothing made that clearer than the drop-off that was seen in the Divergent series.

The Divergent Series: Insurgent definitely raises some questions. Like how is Tris so good at hair styling? How did the bad guys get that magic technology in the past 5 days? How do any conspiracies exist when truth serum is a thing? How does Janine lose when she’s mind-controlling an entire faction?

To answer all these questions, check out the pitch meeting that led to The Divergent Series: Insurgent!
