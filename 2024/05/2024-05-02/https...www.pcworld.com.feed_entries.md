<p><em>Editor&rsquo;s note: Updated May 2, 2024 with new information about Supreme Court&rsquo;s refusal to hear the case against governmental overreach.</em></p>



<p>This March, in response to <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/23/23-50627-CV0.pdf&amp;xcust=2-1-1807277-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Texas&rsquo;s age-verification law being upheld</a>, the ultra-popular PornHub and numerous other adult sites operated by parent company Aylo went dark in the state. Replacing the NSFW videos you&rsquo;d normally expect to see, a message decrying government overreach and proposed compromises has been posted.</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s a similar chain of events to what happened last year <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.cnn.com/2023

<p>For World Password Day, Microsoft is doing something I can appreciate: helping get rid of them. Today, the company said that all Microsoft consumer accounts will be passkey enabled. Adios, passwords!</p>



<p>What&rsquo;s a passkey? It replaces passwords by combining something you have (such as a phone, a physical security key, or your password manager) with either something you know (a PIN number) or something you <em>are</em>, using biometric security. On Windows, that means using a fingerprint reader or <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394379/windows-hello-webcams-you-can-buy-right-now.html">webcam with Windows Hello</a>.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Starting today, you can use a passkey to sign in to Microsoft apps and websites, including Microsoft 365 and Copilot on desktop and mobile browsers,&rdquo; Microsoft said in a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?i

<p>In addition to being a pretty great device all on its own, the Steam Deck makes an ideal stream machine, playing either your own local games from a dedicated gaming PC or cloud games via a service like GeForce Now or Stadia (<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1338418/rip-stadia-google-gives-up-its-game-streaming-ghost.html">RIP, Stadia</a>). But actually getting to the service using the Steam Deck&rsquo;s console-style controls is a bit of a headache. Nvidia is fixing that with the latest update. </p>

<p>Passwords suck. If they&rsquo;re easy to remember, they&rsquo;re the simplest to guess. If they&rsquo;re difficult to crack, they&rsquo;re the hardest to recall. Even if you <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407092/best-password-managers-reviews-and-buying-advice.html">use the strongest passwords possible</a>, they&rsquo;re ineffective if they become known.</p>



<p>Which is why I&rsquo;ve stopped using them as much to log into my accounts. But I haven&rsquo;t weakened my online security by doing so. In fact, I&rsquo;ve improved it&mdash;and sped up my login times, too.</p>



<p>How? I set up <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://passkey.org/&amp;xcust=2-1-2321243-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">passkeys</a> for my accounts. It takes just a few minutes, doesn&rsquo;t cost anything, and can be
