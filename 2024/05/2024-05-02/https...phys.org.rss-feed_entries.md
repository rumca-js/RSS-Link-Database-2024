In 2018, golf was estimated to contribute significantly to the US economy, generating $84 billion, supporting 2 million jobs, and providing $59 billion in compensation. Given its prominence, golf holds a valuable position within US culture. However, golf's operations, which inherently require expansive land and energy resources, can have environmental implications. Human behaviors and facility designs governing energy consumption play a crucial role in mitigating these impacts. Regular assessment of land use and energy practices is essential to accurately gauge the environmental footprint of golf facilities and to encourage the adoption of sustainable management practices.

Precisely measuring the energy states of individual atoms has been a historical challenge for physicists due to atomic recoil. When an atom interacts with a photon, the atom "recoils" in the opposite direction, making it difficult to measure the position and momentum of the atom precisely. This recoil can have big implications for quantum sensing, which detects minute changes in parameters, for example, using changes in gravitational waves to determine the shape of the Earth or even detect dark matter.

Play is widespread, but far from ubiquitous, across the animal kingdom. Especially common in mammals, play is also known to occur in taxa as diverse as birds, fish, octopuses, and even insects. But what is its function, given that natural selection never selects fun for its own sake? One prominent hypothesis is that play is beneficial to individuals because it allows them to practice skills needed later in life.
