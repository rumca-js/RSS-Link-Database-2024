<p>Elon Musk has made no secret that he’s <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/sorry-you-wont-be-able-to-block-elon-musk-or-anyone-else-on-x-184331733.html"><ins>not a fan</ins></a> of the block button. Now, X is changing how blocks work on its platform, though it’s (for now) stopping short of Musk’s wish of nuking the feature entirely.</p>
<p>Instead, X is tweaking the visibility of replies in the context of a block. Previously, a user could block someone on X and still reply to their posts. And the person who was blocked wouldn’t be able to view that reply or know the person who had blocked them was engaging with their posts. That’s now being rolled back so that users will be able to see direct replies even if the person posting has blocked them. In a post from X’s engineering team, the company said the change is “part of our ongoing commitment to aligning the block feature with our principles as a public town square.”</p>

Like the more expensive plan, the new Standard membership gives you one free title per month.

The cutting-edge research is happening at universities, including Harvard, and the money is being funneled through an independent Washington-based research foundation, along with a competition for scientists.</p>
<p><em>Bloomberg</em> found that Huawei was the sole funder of a research competition that has awarded millions of dollars since 2022 and attracted hundreds of proposals from scientists. Some of these scientists are at top US universities that have banned researchers from working with the company.</p>

<p>Continuing the long American tradition of wealthy corporate overlords making union-busting comments, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy went on a media blitz in 2022 to warn of the workplace-altering terrors of labor unions. (Surely, it’s an unfortunate happenstance that his urgent PSA coincided with an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tech-companies-union-labor-2022-150022946.html">uptick in organizing efforts at Amazon</a>.) Sadly for Mr. Jassy, the US still has a National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), and <em>CNBC</em> <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/01/amazon-ceo-andy-jassy-broke-federal-labor-law-with-anti-union-remarks.html">reports</a> that the board ruled Wednesday that his anti-union comments broke federal labor laws.</p>
<p>Jassy popped up on <em>CNBC</em> in April 2022 to say that if employees voted for and joined a union, they would become less empowered and could expect things to become “much slower” and “more bureaucratic.” In an interview with <em

<p>The pandemic sucked. Four years ago we were all stuck at home, and would continue being stuck at home for months on end. With all of us trapped in our houses, some products experienced a serious COVID-19 bump. Grocery delivery services absolutely blew up, as did Zoom and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/animal-cross-new-horizons-two-month-review-143541385-143541919.html"><ins>perfectly-timed </ins><em><ins>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</ins></em></a>.</p>
<p>The same goes for Peloton and its line of exercise equipment. People were buying bikes and treadmills in droves, ballooning the company’s market cap from $6 billion to $50 billion. However, what goes up must come down, and Peloton’s market cap shrank to $10 billion by 2022 and now it rests at around $1 billion. The company’s pandemic-era success story has officially ended, and now it's focused on cutting costs. So that means layoffs. Peloton is laying off 15 percent of its workforce, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/05

<p>Whether it’s blocking the noises of your daily train ride, trying to be productive at a coffee shop or just needing to tune out the world for a while, noise-canceling earbuds can provide solace. But, as is the case with all audio gear, the effectiveness of active noise cancellation (ANC) can vary greatly from model to model, even with products from the same company.

You might find better sound quality or all-around choices elsewhere, but if blocking out unwanted sounds is your primary concern, this list has everything from high-end to budget options, in addition to those with the best battery life.</p>

The company revealed passkey adoption metrics for the first time and said they have been used more than one billion times by 400 million Google accounts. &quot;Since launching, passkeys have proven to be faster than passwords, since they only require users to simply unlock their device using a fingerprint, face scan or pin to log in,&quot; Google wrote.</p>

With the Un-Carrier's purchase of parent Ka'ena Corporation, it will not only get Mint, but internationally focused prepaid operator Ultra Mobile and wholesale wireless provider Plum. T-Mobile also promised to keep Mint Mobile's $15 per month/5GB offering that's among the least costly in the US.</p>
<p>Mint Mobile is backed by Ryan Reynolds, who is believed to own 20 to 25 percent of the company.

<p>Anthropic is making its Claude AI easier to access on mobile. The company has released a <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/team-plan-and-ios">Claude mobile app</a> for iOS that any user can download for free. Similar to the mobile web version of the chatbot, the app syncs users' conversations with Claude across devices, allowing them to jump from a computer to the app (or vice versa) without losing their chat history. Users will also be able to upload files and images straight from their iPhone's gallery — or take a photo on the spot — if they need Claude to process or analyze them in real time. They'll be able to download and access the Claude app whatever plan they're using, even if they're not paying for the service.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If they do decide to pay for Claude, they now have a new option other than Pro. The new Team plan provides greater usage than the Pro tier so that members can have more conversations with the chatbot. It also enables users to process longer docume
