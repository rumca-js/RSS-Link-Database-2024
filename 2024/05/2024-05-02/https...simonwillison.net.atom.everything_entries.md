<blockquote cite="https://www.zachseward.com/ai-is-not-a-person/"><p>AI is the most anthropomorphized technology in history, starting with the name—intelligence—and plenty of other words thrown around the field: learning, neural, vision, attention, bias, hallucination. These references only make sense to us because they are hallmarks of being human. [...]<br /><br />There is something kind of pathological going on here. One of the most exciting advances in computer science ever achieved, with so many promising uses, and we can&#x27;t think beyond the most obvious, least useful application? What, because we want to see ourselves in this technology? [...]<br /><br />Anthropomorphizing AI not only misleads, but suggests we are on equal footing with, even subservient to, this technology, and there&#x27;s nothing we can do about it.</p></blockquote><p class="cite">&mdash; <a href="https://www.zachseward.com/ai-is-not-a-person/">Zach Seward</a>

Stephen Bond demonstrates some ingenious tricks for creating surprisingly usable sheet music notation using clever application of CSS grids.</p>
<p>It uses rules like <code>.stave &gt; [data-duration="0.75"] { grid-column-end: span 18; }</code> to turn <code>data-</code> attributes for musical properties into positions on the rendered stave.
