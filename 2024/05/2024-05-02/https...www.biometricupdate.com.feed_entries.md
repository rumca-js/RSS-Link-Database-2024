		An apparent data breach of personal information including face biometrics of about a million Australians has been reported, and an arrest made.

People claiming to be former developers for Outabox in the Philippines created a website claiming they have “facial recognition biometric, driver licence [sic] scan, signature, club membership data, address, birthday, phone number, club visit timestamps, slot machine usage” data. It also says the hack is a response to Outabox’ failure to pay them for 18 months.

The data was apparently collected from 19 venues in New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory operated by ClubsNSW. The firm had contracted Outabox, a hospitality IT provider, which is the source of the allegedly breached data. Outabox received the data f

		In the great <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202404/online-age-verification-debates-continue-in-canada-eu-india">age verification debate</a> sweeping the globe, much attention has been directed at pornography tube sites such as PornHub and XNXX. Meanwhile, the largest UK-based platform for adult content, OnlyFans, has largely flown under the radar until now. That appears to be ending, with the announcement that Ofcom is <a href="https://www.ofcom.org.uk/about-ofcom/bulletins/enforcement-bulletin/open-cases/cw_01283">opening an investigation</a> into whether the site is doing enough to keep kids away from adult content.

OnlyFans has already introduced age verification measures for UK users, in compliance with existing regulations around video-sharing platforms

		A press release from <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/socure">Socure</a> announces the publication of its inaugural Document and Biometric Identity Fraud Report, which examines the rampant use of fake government-issued IDs and new tactics such as AI and deepfake tools being used to fool legacy identity verification. The report is based on assessment of document verification-related account openings across a variety of industries including online gaming, marketplaces, and credit systems.

Socure’s findings say the most prevalent fraud signal it detected is document image-of-image, or document presentation attack – “when the user takes a photograph or uses a screenshot image of the ID, rather than getting a live capture of the document.” This occurred in 63 of al

		Bank of Ireland announced it will invest more than €34 million (roughly US$36 million) to upgrade its phone and CRM systems, including adding voice biometrics for authentication.

The use of voice biometrics will improve fraud protection and reduce waiting times for customers. This investment follows an announcement of €60 million (US$64 million) on ATMs and branch networks, and €50 million (US$54 million) on fraud protections.

“This is the largest single investment in enhanced systems and technology for our frontline colleagues in branches and contact centers that the Bank has ever made. We receive more than 11,000 calls on average each day and when customers call us they want speed, expertise and security," says Susan Russell, CEO, Bank of Ireland Retail Ireland.

Do you remember the scene in 'Ocean's Eleven' where Danny Ocean's team cleverly tricks the casino's security system? They injected a pre-recorded video feed of an undisturbed vault, leading Terry Benedict and his security team to believe that nothing was amiss, even as the heist was in full swing. This cinematic moment showcases the power and potential danger of video injection attacks. In the real world, detecting such breaches in surveillance and data systems is paramount. In this article, we will delve into the methods and technologies behind video injection detection, ensuring that life doesn't imitate art in our most secure spaces.

		An Accelerator Lab programme implemented by UNDP Namibia is enabling many citizens to enjoy basic services they hitherto were cut off from for lack of digital legal identity.

Via a series of blog posts, UNDP Namibia is spotlighting the impact of the program which started with a pilot in Groot Aub - a poor community on the outskirts of the country’s capital – and later deployment at scale. It is implemented by UNDP Namibia in collaboration with the Ministry of Home Affairs, Immigration, Safety, and Security (MHAISS), and it is said to be the first time the UNDP’s model governance framework on digital legal identity is being deployed anywhere in the world.

The UNDP defines digital legal ID as a physical or digital credential as well as the enabling process which seeks to ensure that the c

		Gabon kicked off a civil registry issuance campaign in the greater Libreville area ahead of a broader national initiative. Registration centers for Gabonese people to apply for their Numéro d'Identification Personnel (NIP) were visited by government officials as they consider the expansion of registration both within greater Libreville and the surrounding country.

The NIP is required for applications to receive Gabon’s digital ID card, the Carte Nationale d'Identité Electronique (CNIE).

Registration centers are found at the headquarters of the General Directorate of Documentation and Immigration (DGDI), at the Commissariat de Belle Vi vue 2 in the 3rd arrondissement and the Public Garden in the first arrondissement of Owendo.

		India’s financial sector is beefing up its Know Your Customer (KYC) protocols under pressure from regulators.

Financial institutions aim to add more verification layers for identifying accounts and account holders. Multiple accounts opened with a single phone number will receive special attention.

Banks will also require heightened verification from individuals who have multiple accounts opened with different identification documents, The Business Standard <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/finance/news/indian-banks-to-enhance-kyc-standards-with-multi-level-verification-124030500169_1.html">reports</a>.
