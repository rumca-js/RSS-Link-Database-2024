You all did. Short of those actively hostile to 20-over cricket, anyone would have liked to see Fraser-McGurk go crazy berserk, after the boy Jake has spent the past three weeks tearing up bowlers in the Indian Premier League. Instead, he will head from India back home, left out of the T20 World Cup that follows the tournament he\u2019s currently dominating.</p><p>It takes something special for the IPL to cut through in Australia. Fraser-McGurk produced it: 55 off 35 balls to vindicate coach Ricky Ponting on a nerveless debut, a vicious 65 from 18 balls in his other innings at first drop. Up to open the batting in David Warner\u2019s place for Delhi Capitals, he started with 20 from 10 balls and 23 from 14, before another skyrocket with 84 off 27 and a last start of 12 off 7. Even his failures have a strike rate over 150.</p> <a href", "language": "en-US", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2024/may/02/jake-fraser-mcgurk-australia-cricket-player-ipl-form-t20-world-cup-squad", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "source_obj__id": 341, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5e44b7f171b16b06fd605f2d8da8bd6e97523fa/0_116_2698_1619/master/2698.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f35aa6614d3e2aa62963a91ad25969b0", "title": "Why not give Jake Fraser-McGurk a chance to go berserk for Australia? | Geoff Lemon", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-05-02T02:31:24+00:00", "description": "<p>Why has this (very unofficial) diagnosis been trending on TikTok, and is it possible to have eldest daughter syndrome even if you\u2019re the youngest sister?</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2019/oct/18/saved-for-later-sign-up-for-guardian-australias-culture-and-lifestyle-email?CMP=cvau_sfl\">Get our weekend culture and lifestyle email</a></li></ul><p><strong>Karishma, there is a <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@katimorton/video/7338071796152831275?lang=en\">TikTok video</a> that has been watched more than </strong><strong>6 million times about</strong><strong> \u201celdest daughter syndrome\u201d.
