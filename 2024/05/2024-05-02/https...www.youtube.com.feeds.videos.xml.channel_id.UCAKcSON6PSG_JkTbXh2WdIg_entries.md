Toronto band The Beaches are becoming well known to The Current’s audience by virtue of their irresistibly catchy new single, “Blame Brett,” from their latest album "Blame My Ex."

The lead single, “Blame Brett,” was actually inspired by The Beaches' Jordan Miller’s breakup, but ended softly enough that she asked her former boyfriend, Brett Emmons of Canadian rock band The Glorious Sons, if she could use his name in the lyrics because the alliteration just worked so well. “He gave me his consent and his blessing,” Jordan Miller told the CBC in a September 2023 interview.

What’s more, the song isn’t really about Brett; rather, it’s about her own feelings of still processing after a breakup. “It was a really sad and devastating time for me," Jordan Miller said in the same interview with CBC host Tom Power. “There still is a little bit of humour in [Blame Brett] with the chorus, but it is really about me just not being over him.”
