<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi, so I've recently wanted to have my own home server mainly just to host my own dropbox of sorts, so I can sync between my desktop and laptop (when I'm at school). From what I've been reading / watching it seems like nextcloud would be what I want. In the future I'd probably want a jellyfin / plex (potentially even a Minecraft server) service going on but really the syncing between my laptop and desktop is my top priority. I know there's docker so I'm assuming what I want will run on that but that's not the OS right? Proxmox and TrueNas have seem to pop up a lot. I'm planning on using an old dell optiplex or something so I don't know if having VMs would be better as opposed to just having it all run natively. Overall I'm just confused on what OS to use and would appreciate the help.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all! So I was wondering, with my start of selfhosting, I’d love to move as much data as possible to myself. I like to use Swarm app to remember places we’ve been to, especially those on vacations etc.</p> <p>Would you know about some good alternative to Foursquare, currently Swarm for that? I like the slight “gamification” but iťs not necessary. What I’m not looking for is alternative of “Google Maps Timeline” - I don’t see a purpose in having endless traces of daily commutes, there is no additional value for me.</p> <p>What I’m looking for and would love to keep on creating over time is somewhat a map diary for myself, with states/islands/cities visited and specific places/sightseeing/restaurants that is worth to remember.</p> <p>So far I was unable to find anything Thank in advance for tips!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/PenguinOnWaves"> /u/PenguinOnWaves </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://

## Ubuntu Server Restart Loop When Monitor Disconnected

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have a server (HP Prodesk with an i5 8500 and 32GB of RAM) to which I installed Ubuntu Server to convert it into my own server. Initially, I connected it to a monitor to configure it, but then I realized that when I disconnect the monitor, the server restarts constantly. If I reconnect the monitor, it stays on and works perfectly again.</p> <p>I thought it might be some BIOS setting, but I couldn't find anything. Also, I don't think it's an automatic shutdown issue when there's no monitor because it's not shutting down; it's restarting.</p> <p>Right now, the server doesn't have anything on it except a program that updates the IP on Cloudflare to use a domain on my server.</p> <p>I appreciate any help or comments because I'm very lost, and I don't even know where to look.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/langosta_oficial"> /u/langosta_oficial </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sel
