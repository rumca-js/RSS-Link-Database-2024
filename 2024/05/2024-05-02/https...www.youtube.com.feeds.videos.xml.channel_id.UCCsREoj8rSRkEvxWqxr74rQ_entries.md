Comparing CyberGhost with other best VPN options on the market, we can see that CyberGhost is the most affordable long-term solution. While committing to a 2-year plan might seem daunting, it’s going to give you the best value. Besides, CyberGhost offers one of the most consumer-focused money-back guarantees, spanning a total of 45 days. That’s easily more than enough time to see if CyberGhost VPN is for you. And if you don’t wanna get charged, there’s also a free trial.
