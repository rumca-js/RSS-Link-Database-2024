Wiener is the leader of Venture Mechanics, a unique company that is running a new incubator/accelerator program and organizing and hosting events that include casual social gatherings, informational sessions and startup pitches. It’s creating some of the connective tissue that&#8217;s needed in a healthy startup ecosystem. When Wiener opened Venture Mechanics&#8217; space in Bellevue, Wash., in August, his initial focus was on co-working offices and conference rooms &#8212; but the incubator and events are now center stage. &#8220;We can&#8217;t&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/venture-mechanics-aims-to-boost-seattle-area-startup-ecosystem-with-incubat

CDL launched its Seattle hub in 2021. The 9-month accelerator, based at the University of Washington, is unique because it does not take equity from companies and relies on funding from founding members such as the UW and Microsoft. It also enforces objective-based milestones and checkpoints; if a company is not meeting certain standards, they are booted out.  CDL-Seattle is supported by more than 70 mentors that include founders, investors, and other leaders from across&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/meet-the-startups-that-just-graduated-from-creative-destruction-labs-accelerator-in-seattle/">Read More</a>

However, Jassy violated labor law when he said, in multiple public interviews, that unionization would make employees less empowered, and would make it harder to get things done quickly, Judge Brian D. Gee ruled Wednesday. &#8220;[E]mployees could have reasonably understood Jassy to be saying that, without a union, they would be more empowered and could achieve improvements at work faster and with less bureaucracy—two assertions unsupported&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/heres-where-the-amazon-ceos-comments-on-unions-cr

The weeks-long database search was conducted by the Asteroid Institute, a program of the nonprofit B612 Foundation, in partnership with UW&#8217;s DiRAC Institute and Google Cloud. The two institutes developed a program called THOR, which stands for &#8220;Tracklet-less Heliocentric Orbit Recovery.&#8221; THOR runs on a cloud-based, open-source platform known as ADAM (&#8220;Asteroid Discovery Analysis and Mapping&#8221;).
