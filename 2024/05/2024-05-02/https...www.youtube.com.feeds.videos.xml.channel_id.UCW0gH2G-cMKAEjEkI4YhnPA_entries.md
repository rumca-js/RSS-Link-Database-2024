Product Description:
When design work began on The Lord of the Rings in 1997, the look of many of Middle-earth’s most evil creatures was open to interpretation. Loose descriptions in the books, plus rough sketches by seasoned Tolkien artist John Howe, helped guide Wētā Workshop concept artist Ben Wootten in his development of the Balrog. 

Ben Wootten’s background studying both art and biology informed his designs and rooted the Balrog in a tangible anatomical reality, while the flaming mane and cracked lava hide gave it an elemental savagery -  elevating the creature above the rest of the trilogy’s less fantastical monsters.

In 2001, the epic clash between this titan and Gandalf the Grey thrilled audiences and left us with the immortal phrase: “You shall not pass!”

20 years on; the Balrog has been reimagined once more by the team at Wētā Workshop as part of our Classic Series line.
