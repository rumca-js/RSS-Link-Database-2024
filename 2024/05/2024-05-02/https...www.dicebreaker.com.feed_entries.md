Sure, <a href="https://www.dicebreaker.com/games/magic-the-gathering-game/how-to/mtg-arena-codes">Magic Arena</a> is a known entity within the hobby, but publisher Wizards of the Coast barely promotes its existence to anyone slinging cardboard in the real world. That will change in May thanks to a promotion that rewards Arena goodies when you show up to drafts at your local hobby shop.</p><p>Outlined in a recent post to MTG&rsquo;s mothership website, the popular trading card game will grant digital assets to players who register for up to three booster pack drafts during the month of May using their Wizards Account credentials.

It makes sense, then, that veteran designer Andrew Pfister is helping to create a new video game, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2439830/Demon_Loop/">Demon Loop</a>, that wears its tabletop inspirations on its sleeve.</p><p>Demon Loop is an upcoming tactics video game from a new Austrian outfit called Magnolia Games. It&rsquo;s big draw for analogue players is Pfister&rsquo;s involvement in the creative process, and the creator of <a href="https://www.dicebreaker.com/games/great-western-trail-second-edition/news/great-western-tr
