<p><strong>(Warner Records)<br /></strong>The British superstar has said her new album is influenced by Britpop, rave culture and Primal Scream, but you could go mad trying to find the evidence</p><p>Earlier this year, Dua Lipa gave a lengthy magazine interview, the first salvo on the promotional trail for her third album. It wasn’t very interesting – she’s smart enough to keep her private life and her opinions on anything contentious to herself in a world of over-sharing and constantly simmering online outrage – but there was one surprising detail. She said the album was “a psychedelic pop-infused tribute to UK rave culture”, influenced by Primal Scream, Massive Attack and the “don’t give a fuck-ness” of Oasis and Blur.</p><p>That all sounds intriguing. It would clearly be a dramatic departure from the disco-house sound of 2020’s Future Nostalgia, while feeling curiously of the moment: all those artists reached their peak three decades ago, and 90s revivalism appears to be having a m

<p><strong>Hungerford, Berkshire:</strong> Behind all the top hats and ales, Hocktide is more than just a re-enactment of local folklore</p><p>The knobbly pollarded street trees along Hungerford’s broad rural high street are maypoled with ribbons. It’s quietish, as usual. But at intervals, a small crowd in top hats, carrying oranges, baskets and beribboned poles of yellow and blue flowers, emerges from each house and enters another in turn.</p><p>The pebbledashed frontage of two cottages conceals the two halves of a medieval cruck house, its pre-chimney beams smoke-blackened: a house that’s witnessed this ceremony each of its 575 years. Each neighbour retains grazing rights on the town’s common, due to the historical tenacity of the people here. This colourful spring pageant – coinciding with the first swift over the rooftops – is Tutti Day, the near-culmination of a fortnight’s Hocktide ceremonies, a celebration and a reaffirmation of the townspeople’s common rights.</p> <a href="htt

There had better be a good reason to invoke it. The Tattooist of Auschwitz is a drama that raises the question of whether fiction can ever be an appropriate response to the Holocaust; on this evidence, perhaps not.</p><p>In 1942, a young Slovakian Jew named Lali (Jonah Hauer-King) is deported to the Auschwitz II-Birkenau extermination camp in Poland. He is soon given the task of tattooing serial numbers on to the arms of new arrivals – one of them is Gita (Anna Próchniak), with whom Lali falls instantly in love. Thanks to the privileges Lali’s job brings, and the protection given to the couple by the unstable SS officer Stefan Baretzki (Jonas Nay), Lali and Gita are able to pursue their romance

<p>A 90,000 sell-out is expected for third visit to Florida and organisers believe the US fanbase is here to stay</p><p>As Formula One prepares for its first meeting of the year in the United States it is Miami, the party town, that will host the latest in what has been a series of season-opening celebrations by Max Verstappen. Yet the Dutchman’s dominance does not faze race organisers in Florida, who are convinced of the continued growth of the popularity of F1 in the United States.</p><p>F1 is here for the third time and is one of the meetings F1’s owners, Liberty Media, wanted to promote when they took over the sport. An “event” race in a destination city; a racing Super Bowl, an extravaganza where the show, the spectacle and the experience was considered as vital as the cars on the track. Inevitably, the very idea put the hackles up of diehards in Europe but F1 has room for a spot of showbiz alongside the stately classics.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/202

The paper is thin and ratty on the edges, but the handwriting and the turn of phrase is unforgettably hers.

Support acts are supposed to be warmup funny, not red-hot funny.

He put it poetically like this: “Punters asking for clarification. Clarification isn’t going to help you mate. You’re in the hands of the gods now. Welcome to the contested and subjective nature of truth. It’s vibes all the way down. You are merely an ant in the quiz controversy universe. Let go.” Of course, the Thursday quiz never has ambiguous wording, typos or controversial errors, and that is why there is never any quibbling in the comments.

Concentrate not on the eccentric use of quotation marks, but on the twang, because that’s what Eddy did. From 1958 to 1963 his guitar sound – a decade later, Melody Maker would call him “the first real guitar superstar of the rock and roll age” – was all over the charts in both the US and UK, inspiring countless hordes, before disappearing almost completely when the Beatles transformed pop music.</p><p>Eddy’

Mariah Louca longs to perform as Dangerous Liaisons’ evil schemer Marquise de Merteuil. And for Reece Lyons, it’s the monstrous ambition of Lady Macbeth that makes her the ideal role. But, until attitudes within British theatre shift, it’s unlikely these talented performers will get to play their dream characters. Despite their skill, training and accolades, trans women just don’t seem to get cast in cisgender roles.</p><p>“I have never seen a trans woman on stage play a mother or a love interest,” Offie-award-winning Lyons says. “Why don’t we come to mind for that?” Lyons is sitting on a low couch in a light-streamed room across from Tatum and Louca.

Every one of Sarah Perry’s novels has grappled lavishly with this question. Fate v free will; doubt v certainty; science v God. The metaphysical battleground is Perry’s literary terrain. She cannot seem to escape its gravitational pull, nor the estuarine mud of her home county. And so it seems only fitting that the Essex author’s new novel, Enlightenment, is a tale of orbits, collisions and other cosmic ellipses: inescapable loops.</p><p>We begin in the winter of 1997 in the fictional riverside town of Aldleigh, a version of Chelmsford, where Perry grew up. This was a decisive year for Britain: the year of Tony Blair and the New Labour landslide, the handover of Hong Kong, and Princess Diana’s funeral pageantry.

<p>In the new documentary The Contestant, a Japanese man is put through an astonishing TV experience for more than a year</p><p>When Tomoaki Hamatsu, an aspiring comedian from the Japanese province of Fukushima, auditioned for the reality show Susunu! Denpa Shōnen in January 1998, he arrived with zero expectations and a dream for some fame. Reality television was still in its Wild West infancy – no contracts, no protections, still just a handful of home-grown personalities. The new frontier of reality celebrity was just opening up, and Hamatsu, who went by the childhood nickname Nasubi – the Japanese word for eggplant, owing to his long face – saw an opportunity. His only boundary was a request from his mother: “Don’t get naked.”</p><p>As captured by the show’s producers and now reassembled in the remarkable new Hulu documentary The Contestant, a young Nasubi – short hair, wide and near-blinding smile – “won” the audition with the right lottery ticket. His prize? A stranger-than-ficti

<p>Simon Chambers’ documentary is unsparing in capturing his theatrical relation’s endearing, sometimes desperate and often infuriating decline</p><p>Films about film-makers and their kith and kin sometimes get dismissed as self-serving, self-indulgent or even – everyone’s favourite smear word these days – narcissistic. Director Simon Chambers’s wrenching film about his relationship with his aged uncle David is none of those things; I can think of few documentaries that are more honest, self-scrutinising and revelatory about ageing, familial love and its limits, and the whole tragicomic process of dying. It’s the sort of thing you might call “raw” – in the sense that wounds are raw – but the craftsmanship is never raw, despite the obvious lack of budget.</p><p>Chambers, mostly a voice narrating the story, and occasionally a presence on screen, explains how he was effectively summoned back to London from Delhi where he was making a film about cars.

<p>The disarmingly candid film follows Vincent and his loved ones as they try to find ways to deal with a devastating prognosis</p><p>When he was 24, film-maker Kit Vincent was diagnosed with a brain tumour; doctors said that he could expect to live four to eight years. This emotional, raw and quietly powerful documentary started out as a study of how his dad Lawrence came to terms with his son getting ill. The title is a giveaway that the finished article is not that film.</p><p>At times, it feels like family therapy. Vincent hangs out with his parents, who divorced when he was a teenager. Time is running out, and the camera is switched on – two facts that force everyone into the kind of deep, soul searching conversations that most of us spend a lifetime avoiding having with family.

Labour has managed that since 2019. But parties do not change easily. Sometimes, indeed, they respond by doubling down on past error, as the Conservatives have done. But the choice between continuity and change cannot be ducked, and it is the one that now faces the Scottish National party after Humza Yousaf’s resignation this week.</p><p>Part of the crisis confronting the SNP is immediate and circumstantial. The SNP is easily the largest party in the Scottish parliament. Until the next Holyrood election, due in 2026, Scotland cannot be governed without it. But the SNP has lost popularity, is a divided party and, since the breach with the Greens last week, has no natural allies that it is able to call on. Its opposition rivals, moreover, have zero intere

<p>In 20 years, this Essex club has tumbled down the leagues and seen its ground fall apart. Is a revival finally coming – or will hopes be dashed again?</p><p>The Bentley was not on the driveway. By now, after nine months of protests, the Southend United fans knew that meant Ron Martin wasn’t home. Martin is the chairman of Southend United FC, and his almost 25 years in charge are widely seen – both by fans and more dispassionate observers – as one of the most disastrous chairmanships in modern football. Since 2007, Southend have sunk from the English game’s second tier, the Championship, down to the third and then the fourth. In 2021, the club fell out of the league entirely for the first time in its history. At this final indignity, a plaque at the Blue Boar pub, which marks the site where the club was founded in 1906, was painted over with the letters RIP.</p><p>On the late September day I attended, about 40 or 50 fans were amassed on the pavement outside Martin’s residence.
