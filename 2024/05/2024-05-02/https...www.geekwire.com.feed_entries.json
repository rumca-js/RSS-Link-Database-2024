Wiener is the leader of Venture Mechanics, a unique company that is running a new incubator/accelerator program and organizing and hosting events that include casual social gatherings, informational sessions and startup pitches. It\u2019s creating some of the connective tissue that&#8217;s needed in a healthy startup ecosystem. When Wiener opened Venture Mechanics&#8217; space in Bellevue, Wash., in August, his initial focus was on co-working offices and conference rooms &#8212; but the incubator and events are now center stage. &#8220;We can&#8217;t&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2024/venture-mechanics-aims-to-boost-seattle-area-startup-ecosystem-with-incubat", "language": "en-US", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2024/venture-mechanics-aims-to-boost-seattle-area-startup-ecosystem-with-incubator-and-event-space", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed", "source_obj__id": 131, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Venture Mechanics aims to boost Seattle-area startup ecosystem with incubator and event space", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-05-02T16:38:28+00:00", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"540\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/supernintendo-1260x540.jpeg\" width=\"1260\" /><br />Video game fans will be able to step inside the worlds of Super Mario and Donkey Kong in a new &#8220;Super Nintendo World&#8221; theme park experience opening in Orlando, Fla., next year.

The 9-month accelerator, based at the University of Washington, is unique because it does not take equity from companies and relies on funding from founding members such as the UW and Microsoft. It also enforces objective-based milestones and checkpoints; if a company is not meeting certain standards, they are booted out.\u00a0 CDL-Seattle is supported by more than 70 mentors that include founders, investors, and other leaders from across&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2024/meet-the-startups-that-just-graduated-from-creative-destruction-labs-accelerator-in-seattle/\">Read More</a>", "language": "en-US", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2024/meet-the-startups-that-just-graduated-from-creative-destruction-labs-accelerator-in-seattle", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed", "source_obj__id": 131, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Meet the startups that just graduated from Creative Destruction Lab\u2019s accelerator in Seattle", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-05-02T13:31:21+00:00", "description": "<img alt=\"Amazon CEO Andy Jassy discusses unions on CNBC\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"709\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/heres-where-the-amazon-ceos-talk-1260x709.jpg\" width=\"1260\" /><br />It was legal for Amazon CEO Andy Jassy to say that unionization would make it tougher for employees to have direct connections with their managers, according to National Labor Relations Board administrative law judge.
