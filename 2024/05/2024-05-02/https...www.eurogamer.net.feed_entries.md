A little under a month after Nintendo successfully brought an end to open-source Switch emulator Yuzu, the company has managed to wipe out 8,535 Yuzu GitHub repositories - containing code from the original emulator - all at once with a single DMCA takedown notice.
</p><p>
As <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/one-nintendo-dmca-notice-just-wiped-out-8535-yuzu-emulator-forks-240502/">reported by TorrentFreak</a>, the culling occured after Nintendo filed a DMCA (Digital Millennium Copyright Act) notice with GitHub earlier this week, in which the company specifically targeted a number of repositories it claimed "provide access to the Yuzu emulator or code based on the yuzu emulator [which] illegally circumvents Nintendo's technological protection measures and runs illegal copies of Nintendo Switch games".

Larian Studios has warned of a further - if hopefully short - delay for the Xbox Series X/S and North American PlayStation 5 versions of its fancy Baldur's Gate 3 physical Deluxe Edition, caused by unspecified "production issues".
</p><p>
Baldur's Gate 3's Deluxe Edition was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-is-getting-a-fancy-physical-deluxe-edition-early-next-year">unveiled last December</a> promising an assortment of appealing tat, including a double-sided map, cloth patches, a mind flayer poster, stickers, a soundtrack, a digital art book, and a variety of in-game items - all crammed into a big old box.
</p><p>
The PC Deluxe Edition began its journey to purchasers in March, and Larian initially expressed hope it would be able to get the PS5 version out the door at the same time. However, after runni

Ubisoft's Tom Clancy-adjacent free-to-play shooter XDefiant has - after several delays last year - been given a release date, and launches for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on 21st May.
</p><p>
XDefiant - a 6v6 mash-up of Splinter Cell, Ghost Recon, and The Division - was initially revealed as Tom Clancy's XDefiant <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splinter-cell-ghost-recon-and-the-division-merge-in-ubis-6v6-free-to-play-fps-xdefiant">back in 2021</a>, but Ubisoft later announced it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-drops-tom-clancys-name-from-xdefiant">dropping the prefix</a> following criticism from Tom Clancy fans who felt XDefiant's flamboyant action strayed too far from the franchise's more serious military themes and formula.

As the season of summer showcases creeps ever closer, THQ Nordic has announced its annual digital event will be returning this August with a look at its upcoming games, including the Gothic 1 remake and Titan Quest 2.
</p><p>
Specifically, the THQ Nordic Showcase 2024, as it's imaginatively being called, airs from 8pm BST on Friday, 2nd August - or 9pm CEST/12pm PDT/3pm EDT if you live elsewhere - and will be streamed via YouTube, Twitch, and Steam.
</p><p>
As for what we can expect to see, THQ Nordic is being relatively coy, only confirming appearances from its Gothic 1 Remake (which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/thq-nordic-confirms-full-gothic-remake-after-playable-teaser-proved-popular">confirmed to be in development</a> all the way back in February 2020), alongside <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/17-years-later-were-final

Today we've got examples of all three, giving you an idea of what sorts of keyboards are out there and which you might prefer. </p><p>Here are three reviews then: the low-profile Mistel AirOne, the rapid trigger Meletrix BOOG75 and the custom-built Keychron Q1 Pro with MX Purple switches designed by Cherry and British keyboard maker Glarses.

The third Super Nintendo World location will open next year in Orlando, Florida, Universal Studios has now confirmed, and include the theme park attraction's extra Donkey Kong expansion from the off.

A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/super-nintendo-world-orlando-now-reportedly-aiming-for-2025-opening">2025 opening for Super Nintendo World had long been suspected</a>, despite earlier plans to open back in 2023. 
</p><p>
Universal Studios Orlando made the date official today in a video posted to social media platform X, shared by Nintendo of America. However, there's no exact detail yet on when next year the park will open its doors - so maybe hold off on booking flights just yet.

Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth is the fourth top-selling game in the US so far this year, behind the likes of Helldivers 2 and Dragon's Dogma 2.
</p><p>
That's according to sales tracking from numbers company Circana. Helldivers 2 takes the top spot, which isn't too surprising considering its massive success - it reportedly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-has-performed-well-ahead-of-expectations-and-topped-more-than-8m-sales">sold over 8m copies</a> in its first month and was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-is-now-playstations-biggest-steam-launch-ever">PlayStation's biggest launch on Steam</a>.

While it's far from the first new version of Scrabble ever made, it's a super interesting idea. Scrabble Together arrives on the back of the traditional Scrabble board, and the concept is that it's a cooperative affair. Players sit down with their own letter stacks but then work together. Each turn, everyone has to place a word on the board, but rather than using the numbers on the letters to build a score, the word must complete the conditions listed on at least one of the goal cards that's currently in play. It's the Scrabble equivalent of joining together in Monster Hunter to take down something massive.</p><p>Speaking of touchstones, t
