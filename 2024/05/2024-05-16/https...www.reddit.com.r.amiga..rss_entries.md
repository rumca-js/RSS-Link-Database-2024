<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello, I purchased an Amiga RGB to SCART cable, as well as a SCART to AV adaptor in order to connect it to my CRT TV. Unfortunately, it doesnâ€™t seem to be working for some reason, and the monochrome output works just fine. If thereâ€™s anything that can be done, help would be appreciated! Thanks.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Tashkent21st"> /u/Tashkent21st </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1ctnqab/amiga_500_rgb_to_scart_not_working/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1ctnqab/amiga_500_rgb_to_scart_not_working/">[comments]</a></span>

I when come to playing games just really want to load via o

## Network Addressed USB. Or: Getting your Gotek on the network

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>It came up kind of recently if it was possible to put a gotek &quot;online&quot; with a USB wifi dongle so that you could centrally administer your floppy image files from a single network host (like a NAS device). Then you wouldn't have to keep moving a USB stick too and from some computer that has all your floppy images. And it gives a way to &quot;kind of&quot; network any retro computer/device that you can put a gotek inside.</p> <p>That got me thinking that a Networked USB Mass storage device must already exist and a bit of googling did turn up a SanDisk USB stick that did just this. Though sadly they no longer make this. Then I figured a Raspberry Pi has both a network and USB interfaces so surely one could be configured.</p> <p>So, I've produced a small guide in to getting this working if you would like to use a Raspberry Pi for networked file access over USB. This is a generic solution but I've added some gotek specific notes at the end of the
