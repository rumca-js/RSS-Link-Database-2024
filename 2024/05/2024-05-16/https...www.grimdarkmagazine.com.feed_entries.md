<p>Last Updated on May 17, 2024 Richard Swan will be releasing a follow-up series to his extremely popular Empire of the Wolf trilogy, Orbit announced today. In news that is sure to delight the growing Swan fanbase, Grave Empire will take place in the same world as his current series, though 200 years in the future. The blurb has me absolutely humming with excitement: Blood once turned the wheels of empire. Now it is money.

It&#8217;s nothing that hardcore fans wouldn&#8217;t already be familiar with. The premise of the book is that it details the origins of Fallout as a proposed sequel to Wasteland by Tim Cain before going off and becoming its own thing. It details such stories as how Brian Fargo came up with the idea of a retrofuturistic 1950s style for the Pre-War Era, how Tim Cain got so many big name Hollywood actors to do the voice work for the bare minimum required by their unions, and how the game was a smashing success despite not being a major priority for Interplay at the time. The book doesn&#8217;t just follow the production development of Fallo
