Take-Two Interactive chief exexutive officer Strauss Zelnick has claimed the publisher has not shut down OlliOlli developer Roll7 and Kerbal Space Program 2 studio Intercept Games, despite reports and evidence to the contrary earlier this month.
</p><p>
Word of Intercept Games' demise - and the loss 70 jobs at the studio - came via a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kerbal-space-program-2-studio-reportedly-shut-down-by-take-two">Washington state closure notice</a> submitted by Take-Two itself, and was corroborated by affected employees on social media. Later, Bloomberg's Jason Schreier reported Roll7's closure after reviewing an internal email breaking the news to Take-Two staff.
</p><p>
It's somewhat surprising, then, that Take-Two Interactive boss Strauss Zelnick is claiming, in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ce

2K Games is poised to reveal the next game in one of its "biggest and most beloved" franchises, with the grand unveiling set to happen in June.
</p><p>
More specifically, the big reveal is scheduled for Friday, 7th June, and will take place during Geoff Keighley's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/summer-game-fest-2024-conference-schedule-all-dates-times-streams">big Summer Game Fest live event</a>.
</p><p>
News of 2K's impending reveal came via <a href="https://twitter.com/summergamefest/status/1791201250521825718">Summer Game Fest's official social media account</a>, but details remain vague. It offered no hints as to what might be coming, leaving everyone to speculate what, exactly, that "biggest and most beloved" franchises could be.

US rapper Doja Cat has fired off a series of social media posts blasting "horrible" and "garbage" Fortnite players who use the game's powerful (many would say over-powered) Chains of Hades weapon. 
</p><p>
The Grammy Award-winning artist, whose hits include Say So, Paint the Town Red and Kiss Me More, posted a series of messages complaining about the Fortnite weapon in quick succession yesterday. A warning: Doja Cat uses extremely strong language which we reproduce below.
</p><p>
For the uninitiated, the Chains of Hades are a Greek god-themed whip weapon available this season with two uses: yoinking far-off players towards you, then following up with a blistering series of close-up swipes. They are really annoying... unless it's you using them.

## Jumping in at the deep end: building a high-spec gaming PC as your first

Having written about computer hardware for years, I'd <em>like</em> to think I've got a good handle on what the best components are for the job. However, I've never actually built a PC, despite wanting to for years. After years of using an older HP Envy machine with quite dated components, I decided it was time for a change, and that I wanted a do-it-all gaming PC that would last me as long as this previous option has.</p><p>A combination of excitement and inexperience meant I ended up going a tad overkill - and that became an eye-opening experience, given it instilled a lot more fear into to me get things right. Building a high-spec rig as your first ever isn't the easiest, given the overarching thought of cost in your mind when bui

Always Sunny in Philadelphia star Danny DeVito has been asked whether he'd take on the role of Wario in a Super Mario Bros. Movie sequel, after having been suggested for the role by Luigi voice actor Charlie Day and Mario performer Chris Pratt.
</p><p>
Day, who co-stars with DeVito in Always Sunny in Philadelphia, previously told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amXv_9pg3SM">Digital Spy</a> he wanted the actor to take on the role of Mario's moustache-twirling, nose-picking nemesis in a future film. 
</p><p>
Now, DeVito has been asked whether he'd accept the offer and, seemingly unwittingly, has replied with the perfect money-grabbing Wario response.

Toys for Bob has updated its website with a new logo, leading to fan speculation of new Crash Bandicoot or Spyro games.
</p><p>
<a href="https://www.toysforbob.com/">The website</a> now leads to a black page with just a new central logo of a Tiki mask in purple. What could it mean?
</p><p>
Toys for Bob is, of course, most notably the developer behind Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time and the Spyro Reignited Trilogy. The Tiki mask would hint at Crash, while the purple colour would indicate Spyro.

Ubisoft will now focus on open world and live service games, as it invests in AI to assist development.
</p><p>
The strategy was outlined in the company's latest financial report, which claims record annual sales - in particular for the Rainbow Six and Assassin's Creed franchises.
</p><p>
The company's next games slot neatly into this strategy: namely Star Wars Outlaws, the newly-revealed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, and free-to-play shooter XDefiant.

<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-feudal-japan-title-emerges-from-the-shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> is the latest Ubisoft blockbuster to warn players they'll need an online connection when first installing the game - despite the fact it is otherwise an offline title. 
</p><p>
Shadows follows in the footsteps of last year's Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora and the upcoming Star Wars Outlaws in requiring an internet connection to first play physical copies of the game. 
</p><p>
All three titles include a warning note on the front of their box, visible by retailers such as <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/assassins-creed-shadows-gold-edition-xbox-series-x/6584016.p?skuId=6584016">Best Buy</a>: "Internet required to install the game."

It's finally happened. I've made it to the moon.
</p><p>
Back at the start of the year, we <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/our-gaming-ambitions-for-2024">collectively wrote a piece about our gaming resolutions</a>. Usually resolutions are made to be repeated every year and never achieved - but not this time. I said I planned to get up to date in Final Fantasy 14. I'm determined to make that happen.
</p><p>
And so now, in my quest to whip through the Eorzean adventure before the release of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-dawntrail-everything-we-know-so-far">Dawntrail</a> next month, I have finally made it to Endwalker. At long last, it's clicked.
