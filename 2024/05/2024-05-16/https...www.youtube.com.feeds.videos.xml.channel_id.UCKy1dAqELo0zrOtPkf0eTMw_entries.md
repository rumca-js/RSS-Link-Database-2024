Gray Zone Warfare Early Access reviewed on PC by Justin Koreis. 
Gray Zone Warfare’s early access version has some excellent ideas for a highly realistic take on an extraction shooter, but most of them come with a caveat or two at this point. Yes, the map is huge, lush, and full of enemies to shoot at, but you will need to be prepared to wait far too long for rides to and from objectives. The damage system is realistic and immersive, but it shoots itself in the foot with unreliable hit registration, and playing wounded is a lot less fun. The detailed weapons are painstakingly true to life, with lots of great customization options, but if you don’t already subscribe to Soldier of Fortune magazine it’s going to be tough to make great use of it.

Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga reviewed by Lex Briscuso. Narrated by Erik Adams. In theaters May 24, 2024.
It’s hard to overstate how immaculately crafted Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga is, both as a prequel to Mad Max: Fury Road and as a stand-alone story of how the Wasteland created a powerful character. With a ferocious and savage heart, George Miller’s film takes flight into epic status. Weaving together top-notch worldbuilding, an emotionally resonant directorial eye, searing performances, sharp cinematography, and a hell-raising score, this is a remarkable hero’s journey punctuated by incredible action scenes and an utterly stunning reflection on life and love prevailing beyond the fall of civilization. Maybe Hideo Kojima said it best: “George Miller is my God, and the Saga he tells is my Bible.” Witness it.
