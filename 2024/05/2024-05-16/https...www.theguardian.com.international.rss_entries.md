They were close to an achievement that, to most outsiders, seemed unthinkable and it was time to brainstorm for the smallest possible gains that could push them over the line.

Nobody needed to waste emotional energy on rivals’ fortunes when Ipswich had control of their own destiny.</p><p>Ipswich did not blink.
