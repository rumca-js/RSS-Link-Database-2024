This is a sneak peak at an exciting project coming soon. I am proud to announce Project Homestead in collaboration with Discovery X Midea. You can watch the full project on Midea’s YouTube channel on May 20th at ADD TIME. 
 
I can’t wait for you all to watch this awesome renovation we did for the folks at Hope Willow Ranch in Alaska. I am incredibly proud of how this project turned out and am honoured to have been able to meet these incredible folks. Thank you to Frank & Gena for hosting us and to Thomas, Brian, Jacob and Kelly for trusting us with your home. With the addition of the Midea EVOX Cold Climate Heat Pump you will never have to worry about being cold in your home again. Cheers! I’ll see you all in the comments.
