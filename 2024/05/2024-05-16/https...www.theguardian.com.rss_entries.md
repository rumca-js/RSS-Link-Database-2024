Maybe you hid your homemade lunch while your co-workers ate takeout, or you didn’t call your mom on her birthday and felt bad to have missed it.</p><p>Shame can emerge in everyday situations like these, or can be a more pervasive emotion that darkens your view of who you are. The British clinical psychologist Peter Fonagy <a href="https://www.menningerclinic.org/Assets/2019-menninger-symposium-emailwebsite-version.pdf">called</a> shame the “feeling that destroys the self”.

<p>The grimly effective 2008 home invasion shocker gets a strange semi-remake that sucks out all of the suspense</p><p>In a genre in which innovation is increasingly resigned to the furthest outskirts, there’s something almost admirable about just <em>how</em> staggeringly redundant The Strangers: Chapter 1 is, early contender for 2024’s most pointless horror movie. It’s the third in a series that should have stopped after one, a reboot that’s more of a remake but sold as a prequel while also acting as the start of a new trilogy, an over-complicated attempt to squeeze new life out of old IP. The 2008 original, which starred Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman as a couple menaced by three masked invaders, was a short, sharp shock to the system, a bare-bones exercise in drip-drip suspense made scarier by its cold, motivation-less villains (“Because you were home”).</p><p>There was a stark, naturalistic nastiness to it, closer to Michael Haneke’s Funny Games than most of the silly genre dreck b

<p><strong>Cannes film festival</strong><br />Toads who sweat hallucinogens, lonely pre-teens and a sudden German in a kilt: Arnold’s pick’n’mix latest dives as much as it soars</p><p>Andrea Arnold’s flawed, garrulous new movie is a chaotic social-realist adventure with big, chancy performances, grimly violent episodes, tragedy butting heads with comedy and physical existence facing off with fantasy and imagination.</p><p>It meditates on identity and belonging, the poignancy of not being valued, not being seen, the transition from childhood to adulthood, girlhood to womanhood, sexism and cruelty.

<p>The Generation X punk turned arena rocker answers your questions on near-misses in Hollywood, his overlooked electronic period and how Marc Bolan helped launch his career</p><p><strong>Is it true that you stole the master tapes to the Rebel Yell album during a spat with the record label?</strong> <em>VerulamiumParkRanger<br /></em>It was because of the cover. I was saying: “There’s a flaw in this picture, and if we blow this up it will get worse.” The record company started to say: “We’re leaving it. It’s not that bad.” I just thought: “I’m just not going to let this happen. It’s so silly. They just need to reprint the picture. I’m not listening to what the record company guys say. In fact, I’m gonna blackmail them.” So I went down to Electric Lady in the middle of the night and got to where I knew the tape boxes were. I took them and left the studio and gave them to my heroin dealer. And then I phoned the record company and said: “This guy I’ve given them to, he’ll have them out o

<p><strong>Cannes film festival</strong><br />Nyoni uses unsettlingly playful surrealism in this account of a malign uncle and the family mythmaking that effaces his crimes</p><p>Rungano Nyoni is the Zambian-Welsh film-maker who in 2017 had an arthouse smash with her debut, the witty and distinctive misogyny fable <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/may/25/i-am-not-a-witch-review-satire-zambian-witchcraft-cannes-2017">I Am Not a Witch</a>. Her new film is an oblique, intensely self-aware and often seriocomically strange family drama about sexual abuse. Its final moments give us something of the magic realism that the title hints at, but its playfully and startlingly surreal images are perhaps at odds with the fundamental seriousness of what this film is about. While it’s such an intriguing idea, an almost absurdist scrutiny of what avoidance looks like and how families choreograph their collective denial, there is something a little bit contrived in it and, though always en

This barely a decade after an MRSA outbreak infected three Buccaneers players, two of whom never competed again.</p><p>In addition, players complained about being forced to pay $90 for childcare on match days (most teams offer this for free), being charged $1,750 a season for the privilege of having their own hotel room on away trips and being made to sit at the back of the plane while club staff travelled first-class.

It features a hushed electric guitar figure supporting a lyric filled with very Billie Eilish topics: bitter recriminations about a failed relationship, body dysmorphia, depression and the pressures of finding vast global fame while barely out of your teens.

<p>OpenAI’s updated chatbot GPT-4o is weirdly flirtatious, coquettish and sounds like Scarlett Johansson in Her.

You can now interact with it the same way you’d interact with a human, rather than via text-based questions. It can give you advice, it can rate your jokes, it can desc

<p><strong>Cannes film festival</strong> <br />Loosely based on fact, Magnus van Horn’s fictionalised true crime nightmare leaves you with a shiver of pure fear</p><p>Just in case you were thinking that this is an upbeat story of a sweet young seamstress winning BBC TV’s The Great British Sewing Bee, the needle in question is in fact a knitting needle for giving yourself an abortion in a public bath-house in post-first world war Copenhagen. This film from Poland-based Swedish director Magnus van Horn – making his Cannes competition debut – is a macabre and hypnotic horror, a fictionalised true crime nightmare based on Denmark’s baby-killer case from 1921, shot in high-contrast expressionist monochrome and kept at an almost unbearable pitch of anxiety by Frederikke Hoffmeier’s nerve-abrading musical score.</p><p>I was unconvinced by Van Horn’s previous film, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/jun/23/sweat-review-the-loneliness-of-the-social-media-influencer-magdalena-kolesn

<p>From pests to pampered pets … how Victorian artist Louis Wain ushered in the age of the cat</p><p>‘Catland”, as Kathryn Hughes describes it, is two things. One is&nbsp;the imaginary universe of Louis Wain’s illustrations – in which cats walk on their hind legs and wear clothes, and humans do not feature. In&nbsp;the late Victorian and Edwardian eras, these kitschy pictures were everywhere and he was world famous. He’s all but forgotten now, though his influence lives on. And one of the ways it does, Hughes argues, is in the other “Catland”, the one we all live in. Wain’s career accompanied a transformation in attitudes between 1870 and 1939 in which cats went from being necessary evils or outright pests to fixtures of home and hearth.</p><p>For much of human history, cats were nameless creatures who lived on&nbsp;scraps, caught mice and unsightly diseases, yowled in streets, were familiars of witches and had fireworks stuffed up their bums by cruel children.

How far can our minds take us – dreaming, fantasising, making art – and when must we return to a shared reality? “Real comes and goes and isn’t very interesting,” a therapist advises in July’s 2015 debut novel, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/feb/11/the-first-bad-man-by-miranda-july-review-debut-novel">The First Bad Man</a>. Most of the characters in her 2005 debut film, Me and You and Everyone We Know, throw themselves dizzyingly into dream and play. In the film, it’s fantasy that enables genuine connection; in the novel, the protagonist has to move beyond fantasy to discover that life’s core lies elsewhere – in the touch of a lover or a baby.</p><p>This breezy commitment to inwardness and strangeness has often led to July being described as kooky.

A Norwegian tycoon has the answer</p><p>If you’ve ever wondered what it would feel like to be as insignificant as a kernel of corn, you can now get a good idea in Kristiansand, a city in southern Norway. Standing on the fourth floor of its new <a href="https://www.kunstsilo.no/en">Kunstsilo art museum</a>, carved out of an old 1930s grain silo, you can peer down a vertiginous concrete tube that plunges towards huddles of ant-like people below. Or you can look up, through more concrete shafts, towards tiny circles of sky. You can mimic the journey of a grain by climbing a spiral staircase inside one of the cylinders, or test your nerves by walking on a glass-floored terrace suspended over another shaft, floating above a tubular abyss. It’s a dramatic spatial spectacle – and we haven’t even got to the art yet.</p><p>Once

<p>A brilliantly funny but deadly serious account of NHS psychiatry in crisis</p><p>On his first day as a trainee ­psychiatrist, Dr Benji Waterhouse ­–conflict averse, bookish, balding – receives a crash course in martial arts. A brawny ex-policeman with tumescent biceps exhorts the gaggle of junior doctors never to wear a tie unless they want to getthrottled, never to make a patient a cup of hot tea unless they want to get scalded, and to always sit in the chair closest&nbsp;to the door in case their life depends on ­making a quick getaway.</p><p>It’s the start of a litany of rude awakenings, documented in brisk and self-deprecating style. Waterhouse’s decision to specialise in psychiatry, for example, is dismissed by one medical consultant as “a waste of a perfectly good doctor”. A cardiologist tells him a psychiatrist is nothing more than “a social worker with a stethoscope”. Nevertheless, he arrives for his first job on an acute psychiatric ward buoyed up by the conviction that he

<p>A route tracing the unification hero’s flight across the peninsula in 1849 runs spectacularly over the Apennines then descends to the sea via a string of gorgeous Tuscan towns</p><p>Crickets leaping round our feet. A butterfly at the rim of my hat. Burrs on our socks. Smells of fern and pine. The rhythmic rasp of the cicadas. And, ranged around us, a never-ending green. Cypress and cedar. Peaks and parched pastures. The combed vineyards and the dark oak thickets. Moving through it all, feeling right inside it, sticky with it even. Like any other animal. This is what we love and why we do these summer walks.</p><p>We set off from the railway station in Ravenna. Heading for the coast. Not the Adriatic, just five miles away. But the Tyrrhenian, on the other side of the Italian peninsula. The remote bay of Cala Martina to be precise: it’s in Tuscany, about halfway between Genoa and Rome.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/article/2024/may/16/a-walk-across-italy-in-garibald

<p>Early springs mean food for young of arrivals from west Africa has already disappeared; this year they face the opposite problem</p><p>Migratory birds, especially those long-distance travellers that winter in sub-Saharan Africa, are struggling with the effects of climate change. Specifically, the trend towards earlier springs is causing problems, because when they arrive at their usual time – between mid-April and early May – nature’s calendar has shifted forwards and spring is almost over.</p><p>This is a particular problem for three species that travel from west Africa to breed in British oakwoods: the wood warbler, the redstart and the pied flycatcher. This trio feed their young on oak moth caterpillars, but when spring comes early these have already emerged and are beginning to pupate, so the chicks starve.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/may/16/climate-disruption-to-uk-seasons-causes-problems-for-migratory-birds">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This is a seismic moment as Westminster prepares for power to pass from one party to another. It will affect everything in some way</p><p>The Conservative party’s lurch into collective hyperventilation after 2016 gave Britain five prime ministers in eight years. Yet changes of government from one party to another are actually remarkably rare. There have been only three of them in the past half century: to the Tories in 1979, to Labour in 1997 and then back to the Tories in 2010. Lucy Powell, the shadow leader of the House of Commons, pointed out in a speech this week that, at the age of 49, she has only witnessed two changes of UK party government in her adult life; someone aged 30 will not have witnessed a single one in their voting life.</p><p>More on Powell’s speech later. But her observation about the rarity of change underlines something distinctive as well as something important. Britain’s rare changes of regime make it something of an outlier.

That is a real credit to the show: Bridgerton has established its arresting yet soothing take on Regency Mayfair with aplomb. It’s an immaculately constructed dreamland; the pinnacle of comfort TV.</p><p>It’s also immediately clear that Bridgerton is benefiting from having two seasons under its corset already, laying the foundations for the most captivating courtship yet. Thus far, each series has focused on different members of the Bridgerton children as
