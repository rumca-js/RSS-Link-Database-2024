<p>Nature Materials, Published online: 16 May 2024; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41563-024-01895-z">doi:10.1038/s41563-024-01895-z</a></p>The detailed interplay between electronic and lattice dynamics in two-dimensional perovskite materials remains elusive. Here the authors establish the room-temperature polaronic nature of the excitons in two-dimensional Dion–Jacobson-type perovskites.
