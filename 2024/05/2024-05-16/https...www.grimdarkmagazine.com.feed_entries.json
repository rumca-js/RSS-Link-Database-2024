In news that is sure to delight the growing Swan fanbase, Grave Empire will take place in the same world as his current series, though 200 years in the future. The blurb has me absolutely humming with excitement: Blood once turned the wheels of empire. Now it is money. A new age of exploration and innovation has dawned, and the Empire of the Wolf stands to take its place as the foremost power in the known world. Glory and riches await. But dark days are coming. A mysterious plague has broken out in the pagan kingdoms to the north, while in the south, the Empire\u2019s proxy war in the lands of the wolfmen is weeks away from total collapse.
