<p>Google has solved a fundamental problem with Chromebook gaming in a rather awesome way: How do you play Android touch games on Chromebooks without a touchscreen? For a long time, the answer was simply: you don&rsquo;t. But Google has come up with a way to remap keyboard inputs to touch controls, for every game in the Google Play Store, along with several other helpful Chromebook tweaks.</p>



<p>For whatever reason, Google left out ChromeOS and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/608636/best-chromebooks.html">Chromebooks</a> entirely from its <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2333309/googles-building-an-ai-future-but-not-for-you-and-me.html">keynote at Google I/O</a>, which included AI-powered search enhancements and some rather <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2333139/gmails-gemini-ai-powered-upgrade-looks-seriously-useful.html">interesting

<p>It never fails. You get a shiny, brand-new laptop with ALL the bells and whistles, and yet the same thing lets you down every time. The built-in webcam. Even laptops that promise superior webcams ultimately fail to deliver. And if you&rsquo;re wondering &ldquo;why?&rdquo; the answer comes down to everything else you love about your laptop.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, in this modern world, the webcam is more important than ever. Chances are you&rsquo;re all too familiar with the terms, &ldquo;Zoom&rdquo; and &ldquo;Teams&rdquo; which now mean something totally different than they did 15 years ago. More people are working from home, and even those in the office are still attending remote meetings. And if you&rsquo;re a professional, you want to look good. So why does your laptop&rsquo;s webcam make you look terrible, and what can you do about it?</p>
