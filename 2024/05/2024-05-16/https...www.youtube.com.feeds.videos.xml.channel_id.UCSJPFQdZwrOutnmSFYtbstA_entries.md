It never rains but it pours. Amazon's long-awaited teaser for Rings of Power Season 2 finally released, and got promptly destroyed. Doctor Who released some of the worst episodes of TV ever created, and nobody celebrated the announcement that Phoebe Waller-Bridge's Tomb Raider show has been officially greenlit. Join me, MauLer, Gary, Shadiversity, Ryan Kinel and Despot of Antrim at the Open Bar.
