Apple’s <a href="https://www.apple.com/support/systemstatus/">system status page</a> hasn’t noted any issues as of 6:30PM ET, but reports across social media show something is going on. People have reported the problem across multiple wireless carriers (Verizon, AT&amp;T, and T-Mobile), countries, and even continents.</p>

  <p id="K0OPLs">A new sports streaming service is coming later this year. We’ve known for months who is working on the service; it’s a co-venture from ESPN, Fox, and Warner Bros. Now, we also know what it’s going to be called: <a href="https://www.venu.com/">Venu Sports</a>.</p>
<p id="klwzKx">The naming announcement comes <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/6/24064007/espn-fox-warner-bros-sports-streaming-partnership">a few months after</a> the three networks said they were planning to launch a “differentiated sports-centric service,” <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/12/24070677/sports-streaming-service

Some of those perks include a true optical zoom, AI-assisted autofocus, and a unified app experience.</p>
<p id="zmOCm9">It has three cameras on the back: a 24mm main camera with a 48-megapixel Sony Exmor T sensor, a 16mm ultrawide, and an 85-170mm variable zoom telephoto camera that provides magnification around 3.5x to 7.1x that of the main camera. The Xperia 1 VI also utilizes this new

  <p id="sABAQY">Microsoft isn’t launching a new version of Windows next week, but what it’s about to unveil could be just as significant. After nearly four years of falling behind Apple’s MacBooks, sources inside Microsoft tell me that the company is confident it can finally beat Apple’s own chips that power the MacBook Air.</p>
<p id="EwSA9b">On Monday, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella will detail the company’s “AI vision across hardware and software” at an event hosted at Microsoft’s campus in Redmond, Washington. It’s a pivotal moment for Microsoft and Windows because it won’t involve the typical chip partnership with Intel that we’ve seen for decades. Instead, Microsoft will set the stage for a

  <p id="IAfwuj">Fujifilm has just announced a pair of new cameras at the company’s X Summit Sydney event. There’s the medium format GFX100S II, which frankly falls outside my scope of interest (and budget). The more mainstream of the two is the X-T50, which is a followup to — but <em>not</em> a replacement for — the X-T30 II, which will remain in Fujifilm’s lineup moving forward.</p>
<p id="2hqjIT">The X-T50 is a hodgepodge of the camera maker’s new and old tech. Let’s start with the new. The body has a fresh, more rounded shape that’s unlike anything else in the X-Series lineup, and there’s a film simulation dial right on
