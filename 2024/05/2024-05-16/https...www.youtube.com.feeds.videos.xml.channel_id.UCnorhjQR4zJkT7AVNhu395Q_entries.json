I am proud to announce Project Homestead in collaboration with Discovery X Midea. You can watch the full project on Midea\u2019s YouTube channel on May 20th at ADD TIME. \n \nI can\u2019t wait for you all to watch this awesome renovation we did for the folks at Hope Willow Ranch in Alaska. I am incredibly proud of how this project turned out and am honoured to have been able to meet these incredible folks. Thank you to Frank & Gena for hosting us and to Thomas, Brian, Jacob and Kelly for trusting us with your home. With the addition of the Midea EVOX Cold Climate Heat Pump you will never have to worry about being cold in your home again. Cheers! I\u2019ll see you all in the comments.\n \nTo learn more about Midea\u2019s products, contact:\n\ud83d\udccd 158-15 Union Turnpike, Fresh Meadows, NY\n\ud83d\udcde 1-888-MIDEA NA (1-888-643-3262)\n\ud83c\udf10 http://www.mideacomfort.us\n\ud83d\udce7 infohvac.na@midea.com", "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdrGIXGi7JM", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCnorhjQR4zJkT7AVNhu395Q", "source_obj__id": 143, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/JdrGIXGi7JM/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "I Filmed a Renovation Show in Alaska SNEAK PEAK", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
