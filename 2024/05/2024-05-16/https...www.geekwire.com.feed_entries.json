Seattle is one of the first cities in the world to get the new model, the company said Thursday. The throttle near the right handlebar grip functions similarly to the throttle on Lime&#8217;s e-scooters. Riders can start from a full stop, make it up steep hills and travel longer distances without working up a sweat by pedaling. &#8220;That we chose to launch it here is Lime\u2019s recognition of Seattle as a preeminent city&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2024/lime-brings-new-e-bikes-with-throttle-to-seattle-as-company-calls-city-a-global-micromobility-leader/\">Read More</a>", "language": "en-US", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2024/lime-brings-new-e-bikes-with-throttle-to-seattle-as-company-calls-city-a-global-micromobility-leader", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed", "source_obj__id": 131, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Lime brings new e-bikes with throttle to Seattle as company calls city a global micromobility leader", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-05-16T19:00:00+00:00", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"709\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Horizontal_linkedin-1260x709.png\" width=\"1260\" /><br />After about three years at Amazon working on Alexa voice services, Pierson Marks listened to his own internal dialogue and left to launch a startup. A Southern California native who studied computer science at UCLA, Marks stayed in Seattle to create Jellypod, an AI-powered service that turns daily newsletters into personalized podcasts. &#8220;Voice has always been something that was I was pretty passionate about,&#8221; Marks said.

Jay Inslee, a climate stalwart who based his past presidential run on the issue, traces his passion for clean energy in part to a trip he made to Stockholm decades ago. He recounted that visit in his keynote presentation at the Nordic Innovation Summit, held this week in Seattle. In his travels to the Swedish capital, he discovered double-paned windows, which at the time were a cutting-edge technology not yet popular in the U.S. &#8220;I said, &#8216;These people are smart,&#8217; &#8221; Inslee recalled. &#8220;They were ahead of us by 20 years &#8212; they might be still ahead of&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2024/what-the-u-s-can-learn-from-nordic-countries-on-climate-seattle-summit-draws-global-leaders/\">Read More</a>", "language": "en-US", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2024/what-the-u-s-can-learn-from-nordic-countries-on-climate-seattle-summit-draws-global-leaders", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed", "source_obj__id": 131, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "What the U.S. can learn from Nordic countries on climate: Seattle summit draws global leaders", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-05-16T17:23:15+00:00", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"840\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/GoodShip-Founders-2-1-1260x840.jpg\" width=\"1260\" /><br />GoodShip raised a $8 million Series A round led by Bessemer Venture Partners that will boost its software platform that helps companies get a better handle on their shipping logistics data.", "language": "en-US", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2024/goodship-a-freight-network-logistics-startup-led-by-convoy-vets-raises-8m", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed", "source_obj__id": 131, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "GoodShip, a freight network logistics startup led by Convoy vets, raises $8M", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-05-16T16:22:53+00:00", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"945\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/seattlewaterfront-1260x945.jpg\" width=\"1260\" /><br />Seattle&#8217;s population growth suffered a bit of a bump in the boom as the city fell out the top 10 fastest-growing big cities in the country, according to new U.S. Census Bureau data released Thursday. Seattle added about 5,900 residents between July 1, 2022, and July 1, 2023, to reach a population of 755,078. The growth rate of 0.8% puts the city at 13th among places with a population of at least 250,000. The growth is certainly acceptable compared to cities that are losing population, such as New Orleans\u00a0(-1.56%), St. Louis (-1.55%) and Philadelphia (-1.04%).
