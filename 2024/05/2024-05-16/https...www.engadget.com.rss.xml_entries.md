<p>Immersion blenders (or hand blenders) might not be absolutely essential in every good kitchen arsenal. But they can unlock faster and easier ways of making soups, smoothies, sauces and more. Plus, they’re smaller than their countertop brethren, which often makes them a better choice for RVs, boats or apartments where space is a premium. Finally, because cleaning them is usually as simple as running them in a bowl of hot soapy water, there’s less hassle, too. To help you figure out which immersion blender is right for you, we’ve put together a list of our favorite models across a variety of needs and use cases.</p>

<p>The case stems from a post by a Japanese user who was replying to a screenshot of a news article about Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and allegations of tax evasion. The reply, according to the board, included “several hashtags using the phrase ‘drop dead.’” Meta’s content moderators removed the post, citing the company’s rules against inciting violence. But after the user appealed to the Oversight Board and had the case accepted, Meta reversed course, saying that the post didn’t violate its rules after all.</p>

<p>Eight TikTok creators are suing the US government in an effort to block a law requiring TikTok’s parent company, ByteDance, to sell the service or face a US-wide ban. The lawsuit claims the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act is unconstitutional because it violates the First Amendment rights of the creators who depend on the platform.</p>
<p>TikTok has already filed its own lawsuit against the government, but according to <em>The Washington Post</em>, the company is “covering” the legal fees for this separate suit too. ByteDance has money.</p>
<p>But will it work? Maybe? A group of TikTok creators sued Montana over an attempted statewide ban last year. And that ban never happened.</p>

<p>Fujifilm has unveiled the X-T50 APS-C mirrorless camera, a long-awaited follow-up to the consumer-friendly <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-15-fujifilm-x-t30-review.html">X-T30</a> and X-T30 II. The new model retains key features from the past model, including the light weight and generous manual controls. At the same time, it adds a higher-resolution 40.2-megapixel sensor, 6.2K 30p video and other features from the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fujifilm-x-t5-camera-price-release-date-141508004.html">X-T5 and other recent models</a>. However, it also has a much higher price than the X-T30 and unusual new dial that may prove controversial.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The X-T50 looks similar to the X-T30 II, with a relatively slim and light 438 gram (15.45 ounce) body, just a bit heavier than before.

<p>Fujifilm‚Äôs successor to the GFX 100S, its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fujifilm-gfx-100s-review-140025104-140025444.html">2021 medium format camera</a> with terrific performance but slow speeds, is the aptly named GFX 100S II. The new model is $1,000 cheaper, smaller, lighter and has (shocker) AI features to improve its autofocus, one of our gripes with its predecessor.</p>
<p>The Fujifilm GFX 100S II uses a 102MP high-speed sensor and the X-Processor 5 processing engine. The company says its medium format sensor is about 1.7 times larger than a 35mm full-frame sensor. Its body weighs around 883g (including the battery and memory card), making it the lightest in the lineup.</p>
