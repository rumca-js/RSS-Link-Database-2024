The Lord of the Rings director Peter Jackson discusses Christopher Lee's casting as Saruman in this exclusive clip from the upcoming documentary "The Life and Deaths of Christopher Lee".  Jackson tells of Lee's insistence on auditioning for Gandalf, and that they had no other actor in mind to play Saruman.

Copies of the film will ONLY be available through Kickstarter: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jonspira/the-life-and-deaths-of-christopher-lee/

The film, directed by John Spira, contains a Tolkien sequence animated and directed by Dave McKean.  

The Blu-Ray will also include the FULL Peter Jackson interview, with a lot of footage that didn't make it into the film!
