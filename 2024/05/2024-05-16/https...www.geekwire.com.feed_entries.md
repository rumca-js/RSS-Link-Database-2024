Seattle is one of the first cities in the world to get the new model, the company said Thursday. The throttle near the right handlebar grip functions similarly to the throttle on Lime&#8217;s e-scooters. Riders can start from a full stop, make it up steep hills and travel longer distances without working up a sweat by pedaling. &#8220;That we chose to launch it here is Lime’s recognition of Seattle as a preeminent city&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/lime-brings-new-e-bikes-with-throttle-to-seattle-as-company-calls-city-a-global-micromobility-leader/">Read More</a>

Jay Inslee, a climate stalwart who based his past presidential run on the issue, traces his passion for clean energy in part to a trip he made to Stockholm decades ago. He recounted that visit in his keynote presentation at the Nordic Innovation Summit, held this week in Seattle. In his travels to the Swedish capital, he discovered double-paned windows, which at the time were a cutting-edge technology not yet popular in the U.S. &#8220;I said, &#8216;These people are smart,&#8217; &#8221; Inslee recalled. &#8220;They were ahead of us by 20 years &#8212; they might be still ahead of&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/what-the-u-s-can-learn-from-nordic-countries-on-climate-seattle-summit-draws-global-leaders/">Read More</a>

Seattle added about 5,900 residents between July 1, 2022, and July 1, 2023, to reach a population of 755,078. The growth rate of 0.8% puts the city at 13th among places with a population of at least 250,000. The growth is certainly acceptable compared to cities that are losing population, such as New Orleans (-1.56%), St. Louis (-1.55%) and Philadelphia (-1.04%).
