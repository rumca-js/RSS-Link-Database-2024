In today's Fix of entertainment news:
Marvel Studios executives Kevin Feige and Louis D'Esposito have addressed the slump the legendary studio has found itself in. In response to lackluster reviews and dwindling box office returns, the company will be limiting the amount of movies and shows it releases to about 3-4 movies and 1-2 shows per year. At least starting in 2026, since they've got quite a few movies already scheduled for 2025. In other news, Chris Pine is lamenting what could have been with Wonder Woman 3. The actor, who didn't expect to be in the movie, was 'stunned' that Warner Bros. canceled the project, instead pivoting to reboot the entire DC movie franchise under James Gunn. And finally, Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves would be more than happy to do a Speed 3, or at least some other project together before they get too old.

In today's Daily Fix:
Redfall's promised single-player update was set for sometime in May, and was being actively worked on until Microsoft closed the studio earlier this week. All development on the game has stopped, and the planned DLC set for this Halloween has been scrapped. This suggests that the studio had no prior warning that it was in danger of closing until the announcement from Xbox came. In other news, Nintendo is reviving the Nintendo World Championships with a new collection for the Switch. It's modeled after the minigame collection at the center of the legendary 1990 World Championships, and it's available for pre-order now. And finally, John Wick is back in pinball form. If you've got enough gold assassin coins—and the space—it can be yours starting at $7,000 USD.

Scanline VFX, a globally recognized leader in visual effects, has unveiled a behind-the-scenes breakdown reel showcasing its remarkable work on Netflix's critically acclaimed series 3 Body Problem.

This video offers a glimpse into the intricate craft behind some of the show's most iconic moments, including that harrowing Panama Canal ship-slicing scene. Scanline provided much of the world-building inside the game too, most notably, the stunning dehydration and rehydration sequence of the 'Follower' girl, whose body then crumbles after being frozen. And let's not forget the awe-inspiring depiction of the millions of soldiers and their horses floating upwards to the sky due to loss of gravity. 

The collaboration between Scanline and the show's creative team marks a reunion following their successful partnership on the legendary series Game of Thrones.
