Lightning Talk: Undefined Behavior - Toolkit to Improve Communication With Clients - Laura Kostur - CppCon 2023
https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2023

My talk is about Socially Undefined Behaviour related to working in code. For example what happens when your product owner's instructions and directions are neither instructive nor directive or when a client uses a feature in a way you never imagined. The provides a simple toolkit and a call to action to keep the conversation going.
