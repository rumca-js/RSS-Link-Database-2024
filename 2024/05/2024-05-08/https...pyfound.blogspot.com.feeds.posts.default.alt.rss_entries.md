<p>
  The PSF‚Äôs Grants Program is a key plank in our charitable mission to promote,
  protect, and advance the Python programming language, and to support and
  facilitate the growth of a diverse and international community of Python
  programmers. After much research, input, and analysis, we are pleased to share
  a PSF Grants Program 2022 &amp; 2023 Transparency Report. The report includes
  context, numbers, analysis, and a proposed path forward. It also includes a
  supplemental analysis of several specific grant applications for which we were
  requested to share more information. <br /><br />We feel it is important to
  acknowledge that Pythonistas, regional communities, and the broader community
  are behind these statistics and commentary. Our community called for this
  report to be created. While the report is focused on data and outcomes, we
  also feel it is important to acknowledge in this introduction the concerns and
  frustrations that brought us here, explained furt
