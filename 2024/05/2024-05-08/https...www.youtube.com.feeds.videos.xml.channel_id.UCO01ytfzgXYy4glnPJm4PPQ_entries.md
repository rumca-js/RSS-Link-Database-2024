Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the governor of Maine has announced a plan to get more women involved in the construction industry. This is, of course, part of a nationwide plan to chase men -- especially white men -- out of every occupation and field. This is the thanks white men get for building civilization. Also, the governor of New York claims that many black kids have never heard of computers. Protesters at Princeton attack the university for not providing medical aid to them as they choose to starve themselves. And an influencer on TikTok is here to inform us that it is our moral obligation to date fat people.
