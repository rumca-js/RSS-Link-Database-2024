<p dir="ltr">Twisters will apparently explore what happens when you shoot fireworks into a tornado. The act is courtesy of Glen Powell's character Tyler Owens, who confidently says at one point in the sequel's new trailer: "We don't need PhDs and fancy tech. Sometimes the old ways are better than the new." Not to be outdone, Kate Cooper (portrayed by Daisy Edgar-Jones) responds: "Well, you can always trust a guy who puts his face on a T-shirt."</p><p dir="ltr">This banter and more are part of the action-packed new trailer for Twisters, which can be seen below. The video also features a fire tornado and Owens walking in the rain with a cowboy hat and wet white T-shirt. There's also a truck getting pulled into the air by a tornado and a water tower collapsing, among other destruction.</p><div>          </div><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/twisters-trailer-promises-twin-tornadoes-and-tons-of-destruction/1100-6520987/">The twin tornadoes from the first Twisters tr

<p dir="ltr">Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes has been a tough movie for me to wrap my brain around. It works very well in a moment-to-moment way--the characters are interesting, the action is well-staged, and the world is a compelling one to learn about. But the plot parallels the story from War for the Planet of the Apes weirdly closely, and I'm not sure we ever actually see the kingdom that was promised by the title. This leaves us with a movie that's entertaining but ultimately somewhat hollow.</p><p dir="ltr">Kingdom opens shortly after the events of War for the Planet of the Apes, at the darkly lit funeral for Caesar.

Whether you're falling in love with the world of critically acclaimed movies or sitting back, enjoying movies critics didn't love, everyone can agree that film is a great way to step away from your life to have fun. But when it comes to movies that critics panned, what did they consider the worst of the year?</p><p dir="ltr">GameSpot looked through our sister site Metacritic, which aggregates critics' reviews to award a score out of 100 based on those reviews. And while there are plenty of beloved films this year, there are also more than enough that simply didn't work, at least in the eyes of critics. And sure, you may not agree with what critics have said about the following movies--just like how I don't agree with critics giving <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/movie/demolition-man/">Demolition Man a 34<

<p>One of the primary reasons Microsoft purchased Activision Blizzard last year was because it's the company behind some of the biggest video game franchises, including Call of Duty and World of Warcraft. But now, those franchises are the reason behind a hefty fine for the company. Via <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/activision-hit-with-234-mln-us-patent-verdict-multiplayer-gaming-case-2024-05-06/">Reuters</a>, a federal jury in Delaware has ruled that Activision Blizzard violated patents held by a company called Acceleration Bay relating to multiplayer features in Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare, Call of Duty: Black Ops III, and World of Warcraft. The jury also decided that Activision Blizzard owes $23.4 million in damages.</p><p>The two patents in question are related to technology that allows "simultaneous sharing of information" online between "widely distributed" computers, which is a core feature in many of Activision Blizzard's games.

Between now and June 3, players will be able to play through Destiny 2: Shadowkeep, Destiny 2: Beyond Light, and Destiny 2: The Witch Queen in Open Access.</p><p>Destiny 2's next expansion, The Final Shape, is a pretty big deal for the game, bringing a close to the game's long-running Light and Darkness arc. Fittingly, Bungie is giving players access to more of that storyline for free while they wait for The Final Shape to release.</p><p>Included in Open Access are three out of four of Destiny 2's expansions, with only last year's Lightfall not included in the broader free access period. Only PlayStation Plus members will also get to access Lightfall for free, with Destiny 2: Lightfall
