<p>Generative AI (genAI) tools are becoming more common in the workplace, but business leaders are concerned that their organizations lack a strategy to deploy the technology across their workforce.</p>



<p>That’s according to a Microsoft survey of 31,000 employees in 31 countries, published in the company’s annual Work Trend Index report. </p>



<p>The survey indicates strong demand from employee for access to genAI tools. Three quarters of respondents use the tools in their jobs, the report claims, double the usage of just six months ago. Employees say AI saves time, enables them to focus on more important tasks, allows for more creativity, and lets them enjoy work more. And more than three-qu

<p>Apple’s <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2098241/with-its-new-ipad-apples-empire-strikes-back.html">Let Loose event saw the company introduce</a> an iPad Pro equipped with a next-generation M4 chip, an iPad Air running an M2, a new Apple Pencil Pro, and powerful updates to the company’s pro apps on iPads.</p>



<p>There’s a lot to like about all these announcements. The iPad Pros are thin — at 5.1mm, marginally thicker than the USB-C slot they use. They are also highly performant, with better cameras and improvements across the board. The M4 chip shows Apple pushing far ahead of the entire tablet (and PC) industry, as do the advanced Ultra Retina XDR display and LiDAR capable pro

<p>Google’s dominance in the search arena has given rise to two major antitrust lawsuits from the U.S. government, which allege that the company has manipulated the market to maintain that dominance, to the exclusion of its competitors and the detriment of the public at large.</p>



<p>The first lawsuit, <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/1635380/google-defends-search-business-in-biggest-us-antitrust-case-of-the-century-so-far.html">targeting Google’s search business, kicked off in mid-September 2023,</a> and is now drawing to a close with the delivery of closing arguments, while a second trial against the tech giant, focusing on advertising, is scheduled for later this year.</p>

<p>A variety of emerging work trends could combine to help employees gain an edge in the corporate world. The latest puzzle piece is a recent decision by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to ban non-compete agreements.</p>

<p>Brrrrrrrrrrrrrreaking news, gang: Google’s just announced a new midrange Pixel product that pretty much everyone was expecting!</p>



<p>Titillating, I know, right? But hold the phone for a sec: Before you nod off and start thinking about noodles, there’s more to this story than what’s on the surface — and what most media outlets are reporting right now.</p>



<p>The device, in case you haven’t yet heard, is the 2024 Google Pixel 8a. It looks like a phone. It acts like a phone. It does all the things a phone does. And it’s incredibly similar, generally speaking, to the current Pixel 8 flagship that splashed into the world last fall.</p>
