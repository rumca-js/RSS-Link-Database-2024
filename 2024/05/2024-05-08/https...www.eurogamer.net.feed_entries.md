Closing in on four years since Microsoft's Perfect Dark reboot <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/perfect-dark-reboot-announced">was announced</a>, and a year since it was reported that "little meaningful progress" had been made on the project since its unveiling, it's now being claimed the reboot remains in "a very rough state".
</p><p>
That's according to journalist Jeff Grubb who, while <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcvbGRsH3G0&amp;t=1685s">discussing Xbox's surprise recent studio closures on the Giant Bombcast</a>, told co-presenters, "I've been hearing for years that Perfect Dark is in a rough state, [but] it sounds like it's in a <em>very</em> rough state. It doesn't sound like it's really come together in any way since then."

In the wake of Grubb's comments, several other industry pundits (

Arkane Austin and Tango Gameworks were reportedly in the process of pitching sequels to two much-loved titles - namely Hi-Fi Rush 2 and a potential new Dishonored game - when Microsoft made the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-shuts-slew-of-bethesda-studios-including-redfall-hi-fi-rush-developers">shock decision to close the studios</a>, and more Xbox cuts are said to be on the way.
</p><p>
That's <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-08/xbox-studio-closures-microsoft-plans-more-cost-cutting-measures-after-layoffs">according to Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a> who, citing sources familiar with the matter, says Arkane had been looking to return to its roots following the release of last year's critically panned multiplayer shooter Redfall, and had pitched a new single-player 'immersive sim' - "such as a new entry in t

There's a distinct whiff of hedgehog over in the world of mobile gaming today; not only has Sega just unveiled the Fall Guys-like Sonic Rumble, the very excellent Sonic Mania Plus is now available on iOS and Android via Netflix.
</p><p>
Starting with Sonic Rumble, it's being developed in conjunction with Angry Birds studio Rovio and promises "32-player battle royale challenges" that'll see players thundering across elaborate toybox-themed, Fall Guys-esque obstacle courses in a bid to collect the most rings.
</p><p>
It'll feature "iconic characters from the Sonic the Hedgehog universe" - albeit presented in toy form -  which players can customise to create their own unique avatars. If that appeals, Sonic Rumble will be available for iOS and Android this "winter" - and a (currently US-only, unfortunately) closed beta test is set to run

## Is the closure of Hi-Fi Rush and Redfall's studios a sign the Xbox Game Pass publishing model is failing?

This week on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/newscast">Eurogamer Newscast</a>, we discuss the future of Xbox after the announcement <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-shuts-slew-of-bethesda-studios-including-redfall-hi-fi-rush-developers">Microsoft is shutting a swathe of Bethesda game studios</a>. Hi-Fi Rush and Redfall once seemed primed to benefit from being available via Xbox Game Pass, Microsoft's much-touted subscription service often seen as the best reason to own the company's console. Now, the studios behind both are gone forever. </p><p>Last year, Microsoft's marketing mouthpiece Aaron Greenberg <a href="https://twitter.com/aarongreenberg/status/1649431572137779203">declared</a> Hi-Fi Rush "a break out hit for us and our players in all key measurements and expectations".

Following last week's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-world-championships-nes-edition-spotted-on-esrb-website-for-switch">ratings board sighting</a>, Nintendo has officially unveiled Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition, which promises "over 150 challenges from across 13 different NES games" when it launches on 18th July.
</p><p>
While last week's ESRB listing suggested we might be looking at some sort of NES Remix revival - and that game's spirited does at least seem to be partially reflected in Nintendo's latest release - today's official reveal points to something a little narrower in focus.
</p><p>
As per Nintendo's announcement, Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition is specifically concerned with speedrunning, featuring 150 "byte-sized" challenges that can be tackled across several modes.

Redfall co-director Harvey Smith has reflected on his 16 years at Arkane, "a small company created in 1999 by 'six French guys in a room'".

EA is amassing its "largest Battlefield team in franchise history" to work across "connected multiplayer and single-player experiences".
</p><p>
Yesterday, EA released its latest financial report, with CEO Andrew Wilson sharing his excitement for the future of the shooter franchise.
</p><p>
"Our teams have listened to the community, have learned valuable lessons, and are driving to the future," said Wilson. "Motive, armed with cutting-edge Frostbite technology and compelling storytelling, is joining DICE, Criterion, and Ripple Effect to build a Battlefield universe across connected multiplayer and single-player experiences. This is the largest Battlefield team in franchise history."

I know in my rational mind it didn't, but where did those months go? Why didn't I feel them in the way I normally would? I think I have an inkling why.</p><p>I felt it while watching an orchestral performance of Baldur's Gate 3 at the weekend. It was part of the <a href="https://gmfest.com/">Game Music Festival</a> and featured a special concert arrangement of the game's score, and it was sublimely done. There was a large choir and full orchestra and it gave oomph to the dramatic music from the game. Even the vocalists were there to reprise their iconic "down, down, down by the river" motif. Not that any of this is unique; we've had orchestral video game conc

Mega publisher EA has laid out its slate of games set to launch between now and the end of the financial year - 31st March 2025. It's a pretty thin slate, outside of the usual sports titles, albeit with two mysterious 'unannounced' games still to be named.
</p><p>
One of these is Dragon Age: Dreadwolf, Eurogamer understands, which will be fully revealed this summer after years of teases. 
</p><p>
The other game is a "Partner title" - typically a game which EA is publishing but not developing itself, similar to the just-released Tales of Kenzera, or last year's Immortals of Aveum. This project is set for the financial year's fourth quarter - so between 1st January and 31st March 2025.
