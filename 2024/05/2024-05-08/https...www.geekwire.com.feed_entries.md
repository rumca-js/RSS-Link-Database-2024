Applying AI and machine learning training on precedent case history and the fact patterns associated with those cases, Predict.law uses technology to replace the current process of manually searching for relevant prior cases. The startup&#8217;s initial target market is contingency-based civil cases, in which the attorney and law firm are not compensated unless the case has a successful outcome for the client. &#8220;A predictive tool allows attorneys in these cases to both better select cases&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/legal-tech-startup-uses-ai-to-search-relevant-case-history-to-better-predict-case-outcomes/">Read More</a>
