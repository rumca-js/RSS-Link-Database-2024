Less than two years since its announcement at The Game Awards 2022, Hades 2 is now available for PC via Steam Early Access and the Epic Games Store. It's not the full game - there are still plenty of features and story content inbound - but Supergiant Games has already delivered an impressive slate right out of the gate.

As Melinoë, players venture through different regions to confront different challenges. Many fundamentals remain, from choosing various paths and gaining different resources to the isometric hack-and-slash combat. However, there are new mechanics, progression systems, enemies, and more to dive into.

The story also offers several memorable characters with stellar voice-acting, evolving over each run and presenting new developments. Though it may be early access, Hades 2 is easy to recommend and a stunning experience in its own right.

Xbox's leadership has been questionable for some time now, between development troubles on some projects, others receiving no updates, and what have you. It's all coming to a head, as it recently closed down Arkane Austin, Tango Gameworks, Roundhouse Studios and Alpha Dog Studios, seemingly without warning.

The closures are due to the  “reprioritization of titles and resources" as Xbox Game Studios focuses on "high-impact titles" and "further investing in Bethesda’s portfolio of blockbuster games and beloved worlds." However, it arrives after 1900 layoffs across Xbox, ZeniMax and Activision Blizzard earlier this year and sagging Xbox hardware sales.

Not only does all of this raise questions about Microsoft's acquisition strategy and managerial approach, but also how it could still rake in revenue and choose not to support the developers it brought on.
