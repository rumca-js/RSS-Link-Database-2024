It's not the full game - there are still plenty of features and story content inbound - but Supergiant Games has already delivered an impressive slate right out of the gate.\n\nAs Melino\u00eb, players venture through different regions to confront different challenges. Many fundamentals remain, from choosing various paths and gaining different resources to the isometric hack-and-slash combat. However, there are new mechanics, progression systems, enemies, and more to dive into.\n\nThe story also offers several memorable characters with stellar voice-acting, evolving over each run and presenting new developments. Though it may be early access, Hades 2 is easy to recommend and a stunning experience in its own right.", "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfsdo54_8dI", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "source_obj__id": 129, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/hfsdo54_8dI/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "HADES 2 Early Access Review - JUST FANTASTIC", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-05-08T15:30:00+00:00", "description": "Resident Evil has become almost synonymous with horror games in general.
