After much research, input, and analysis, we are pleased to share\n  a PSF Grants Program 2022 &amp; 2023 Transparency Report. The report includes\n  context, numbers, analysis, and a proposed path forward. It also includes a\n  supplemental analysis of several specific grant applications for which we were\n  requested to share more information. <br /><br />We feel it is important to\n  acknowledge that Pythonistas, regional communities, and the broader community\n  are behind these statistics and commentary. Our community called for this\n  report to be created.
