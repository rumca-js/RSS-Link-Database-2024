<p>Apple <a href="https://www.engadget.com/everything-announced-at-apples-let-loose-ipad-event-161005007.html">unveiled a slew</a> of new iPads on Tuesday, and the updates have brought a bit more clarity to the company's tablet selection. Yes, there are still six different models in total, but the lines separating those slates are more firmly drawn: You have a good option (the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-10th-generation-review-160014897.html">base iPad</a>), a better option (<a href="https://www.engadget.com/hands-on-with-the-ipad-air-m2-a-big-screen-ipad-that-doesnt-break-the-bank-160655629.html">the iPad Air</a>) and a best option (<a href="https://www.engadget.com/ipad-pro-m4-hands-on-absurdly-thin-and-light-but-the-screen-steals-the-show-153641259.html">the iPad Pro</a>).

<p>We’re still waiting for the perfect hybrid PC that can work as well as a tablet as it does as a laptop. As we enter 2024, it seems like many companies have also given up on that ideal — but Microsoft, Apple and Samsung still have some options to consider. And we’re still seeing OS tweaks to make iOS and Android more usable for larger displays. If you’re on the hunt for your next computer and are dead-set on it being a 2-in-1, we’ve collected our current top picks here plus all of the things you should know before making a purchase.<br /><br /><strong>Editor’s note (5/8/2024):</strong> Apple has announced a quartet of new iPads, including overhauled 11- and 13-inch <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apples-thinner-new-ipad-pros-feature-the-m4-chip-and-tandem-oled-displays-142031520.html">iPad Pros</a> with OLED displays, thinner designs and faster M4 chips, a refreshed 11-inch <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-new-ipad-air-comes-in-two-sizes-including-a-13-inch-model-141005701.ht

<p>As a bona-fide hater of actual reality, virtual reality is very appealing to me. However, I’m not that into 100 hour AAA games like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/asgards-wrath-2-is-metas-most-ambitious-vr-game-to-date-172826048.html"><em><ins>Asgard’s Wrath 2</ins></em></a> or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-23-half-life-alyx-review-valve-vr.html"><em><ins>Half Life: Alyx</ins></em></a>. I’m into short interactive experiences that can’t be had anywhere else. Good news for me? The Apple Vision Pro is getting a <a href="https://twitter.com/MarvelStudios/status/1788222425399722487">pretty nifty mixed-reality “interactive story”</a> that could herald the evolution of a new type of entertainment that puts people directly in their favorite shows or movies.</p>

<p>The iPad Pro has always struck me as a baffling device. It's significantly more expensive than the (very capable!) iPad and iPad Air. iPadOS still isn’t a great environment for multitasking. And Apple hasn't yet justified why, exactly, you'd want a super-powerful tablet in the first place (simplified versions of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/final-cut-pro-and-logic-pro-for-the-ipad-make-a-compelling-case-for-a-tablet-based-studio-170009855.html">Final Cut Pro and Audition</a> aren't enough!). If you're trying to get serious work done, you're better off buying a slightly used last-gen MacBook Pro, instead of shelling out $1,000 or more on a souped-up tablet.</p>
<p>And yet, something about <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apples-thinner-new-ipad-pros-feature-the-m4-chip-and-tandem-oled-displays-142031520.html">this year's iPad Pros</a> compels me.</p>

<p>Paramount+ with Showtime annual subscriptions are half off right now, bringing the yearly cost down to $60 down from $120. You have to pay for the year up front, which is never fun, but the offer is available to both new and returning subscribers. That’s not a bad deal, considering you get content from two streaming services that have joined in a blessed union to become one.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/ftx/"><ins>FTX</ins></a> has filed a plan with a bankruptcy court to pay back creditors who held cryptocurrency at the embattled exchange. The vast majority of customers are set to get their money back with interest, though they (and the debtors) missed out on major gains in the crypto market since FTX’s dramatic collapse in November 2022 — the price of Bitcoin has more than tripled since then.</p>
<p>FTX aims to fully pay back non-governmental creditors based on the value of their claims as determined by the bankruptcy court. That means 98 percent of creditors (those who have up to $50,000 in claims) will get 118 percent of the amount of their allowed claims. Other creditors will get their money back, plus what <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ftx-files-consensus-based-plan-of-reorganizatin-302138948.html"><ins>FTX describes as</ins></a> billions of dollars in compensation “for the time value of their investments.”</p>

<p>Tencent and Remedy, the developer of <em>Control</em> and <em>Alan Wake</em>, have completely scrapped their joint gaming project codenamed Kestrel, which they have been working on since 2021. The companies were originally developing a free-to-play co-op shooter until they decided to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/remedy-scraps-plans-for-a-free-to-play-multiplayer-game-174701519.html">go in a different direction</a> in November last year. They went back to the drawing board, renamed their project from Vanguard to Kestrel and had planned to make a &quot;premium game with a strong, cooperative multiplayer component&quot; instead. Back then, they said their game will &quot;lean more into Remedy's core strengths&quot; and will use repurposed versions of the company's assets and themes. Clearly, though, their partnership wasn't meant to be.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bluesky is taking quite a few pages out of the social media handbook. The <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/05-07-2024-product-roadmap">decentralized social app has announced it's working on new features like DMs</a>, video and improved Custom Feeds.

<p>DMs are an especially noteworthy edition as, currently, all posts on Bluesky are public, but the company's new DM option will integrate directly into the app. These messages should initially be available only one-to-one, and users can restrict who can reach out by choosing between the options open, followed users only, and disabled. The company uses an open-source framework, but the development of DMs will initially be &quot;off-protocol,&quot; so Bluesky can &quot;iteratively&quo

<p>OpenAI is reportedly working on a search feature for ChatGPT that could make the chatbot a veritable alternative to Google Search. According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-07/openai-is-readying-an-ai-search-product-to-rival-google-perplexity?sref=10lNAhZ9"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>, the company is currently developing the capability, which can scour the web for answers to your queries and spit out results complete with citations to their sources. ChatGPT could take information from Wikipedia or blog posts, for instance, and link to their original pages when you ask it questions.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Bloomberg</em> says that in one version of the experimental search function, ChatGPT can show you images along with its written responses whenever they're relevant. For example, if the chatbot deems illustrated instructions or diagrams useful for an inquiry, such as &quot;how to change a doorknob&quot; or &quot;how to clean a split-type AC,&quot; then it could incl

<p>Cordless vacuums offer a lot of improvements over their corded counterparts. They’re typically more lightweight and easier to maneuver around your home than upright vacuums, and now that these devices have gotten better over time, you typically don’t have to sacrifice suction power when choosing a cordless model over one with an old-school design.

We at Engadget can help make that decision a bit easier. After testing a bunch of the most popular cordless stick vacuums available today, we’ve come up with our top picks, plus loads of buying advice to help you figure out which cordless stick vacuum is right for
