I colorized, restored and created a sound design for this video of street of Santa Paula, Calif 1920s, we can see the main Street, ISEBELLE School, North Mille Street, Public Library, North Tenth Street, High School

Video Restoration Process:
✔ FPS boosted to 60 frames per second 
✔ Image resolution boosted up to HD 
✔ Improved video sharpness and brightness 
✔ Colorized only for the ambiance (not historically accurate)
✔added sound only for the ambiance
✔restoration:(stabilisation,denoise,cleand,deblur) 

Please, be aware that colorization colors are not real and fake, colorization was made only for the ambiance and do not represent real historical data.
