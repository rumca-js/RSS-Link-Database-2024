Prof. Kaiser explains that inflationary cosmology helps connect our understanding of quantum fluctuations\u2014what he calls the \u201cjitters\u201d that particles undergo at subatomic levels\u2014to the irregular distribution of matter in the universe. What\u2019s most exciting, he says, is that simulations based on inflationary theory produce predictions that closely match detailed measurements of the cosmos. Later in the interview, Prof. Kaiser discusses how he teaches his course on 20th-century science, seeking to demythologize Albert Einstein (\u201cHe was no Einstein as a young person!\u201d) and examining the historical context of the development of nuclear weapons as portrayed in the 2023 film Oppenheimer. He hopes his students will learn to see science not as happening in isolation but as a product and producer of historical events and ", "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asINud1eAx4", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCEBb1b_L6zDS3xTUrIALZOw", "source_obj__id": 437, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/asINud1eAx4/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "The Lumpy Universe with Prof. David Kaiser", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
