<p>Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton have been making these ingenious, heartstopping chillers for a decade now – and the final series kicks off with perhaps the most meaningful episode yet</p><p>Every episode of Inside No 9 is dramatically different – and every episode is also essentially the same. Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton tend to begin each instalment of their magnificent comedy-horror anthology by summoning a scene of distinctively British mundanity: it’s small, it’s boring, it’s awkward, it’s wryly funny – the workaday greyness sparkles with fragments of laugh-out-loud hilarity. Yet from the start, that tableau of normality bristles with nauseating dread – ultimately, the show will excavate from it a blast or two of terror. We know it’s coming, but we don’t know how and we don’t know when. At this point, Shearsmith and Pemberton have used the formula almost 50 times. That it still produces such grimly fascinating, heart-stoppingly tense and peerlessly clever half-hou

<p>Just ridiculous. Just Real Madrid. The team that appears to own this competition, that has some mystical hold over it and has lifted that trophy 14 times, are in the final again because, well, because of course they are. Late, very late on another wild, magical night here, the Santiago Bernabeu launched into a familiar chant. “That’s how Madrid win,” it goes, and so they do. Again, and again and again, each time more epic, more absurd than the last, this football team force that just can’t be contained. The closer you think you are, the further away it is, as Bayern Munich found.</p><p>Bayern Munich had held on, they had survived, and they had scored. They should have scored again, ending this, killing off the team that just won’t die, but they hadn’t. And yet still, Wembley was so close now.

<p>The alt-rock producer and music legend leaves behind a legacy of controversial provocation but uniquely daring music</p><p>There was a story that Steve Albini liked to tell about his senior year in high school. Aged 17, he was involved in a serious road accident: hit by a car while riding his motorcycle, he badly broke his leg. It was while recuperating that he learned his first instrument, the bass guitar, but that wasn’t really the crux of the tale. It was that, while he was in hospital, he received a succession of phone calls from his classmates. They weren’t calling to inquire after his welfare, or to wish him to get well soon: they hated him so much they’d rung up to tell him they were glad he was in pain.</p><p>It was a very Steve Albini kind of anecdote. For most of his musical career – and apparently for years before it – he cut a wilfully confrontational, provocative and polarising figure: as Michael Azerrad noted in his peerless history of American post-punk alternative r

## Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes review – future simians swing through cinematic jungle

<p>This hopefully final prequel to the original movie reveals the story of the crazed ape leader Proximus Caesar – but it’s time the franchise evolved</p><p>After four ambitious and successful pictures, the reboot-prequel Planet of the Apes franchise now comes to what could well be the end, approaching the moment at which Charlton Heston and his crew crash landed, in 3978, in the original movie. It’s where, in 1968, we came in. Of course, if this one is a big hit, yet another prequel-episode could theoretically be squeezed in. But I hope not.</p><p>It’s not that this movie is running low on energy or panache – it isn’t – but the story is tangled and contrived and weirdly anticlimactic because that original film is starting to loom over everything like the Statue of Liberty’s shadow. All that happens has to match up with what we know is coming. There have to be “good” apes we can root for, but also “bad” apes to make sense of the original’s imminent ape tyranny. There have to be “good”

<p>The former world bank economist argues that neoliberalism paves the way for populism</p><p>In 1944 the Austrian-born economist Friedrich Hayek, displaced to Britain, was disquieted by his leftwing academic peers. As Hayek saw it, their political philosophy committed the same error as the fascism that was ravaging his homeland. He wrote that the desire to plan an economy centrally was – in what became the title of his most famous book – The Road to Serfdom: “many who sincerely hate all&nbsp;of nazism’s manifestations are working for ideals whose realisation would lead straight to the abhorred tyranny”. Hayek cast fascism not as a reaction to progressive success, but as its natural endpoint.</p><p>Joseph Stiglitz, a former chief economist of the World Bank and adviser to Bill Clinton, tackles this idea head on in The Road to Freedom, his rejoinder to Hayek’s work and that of his libertarian fellow traveller Milton Friedman. As Stiglitz sees it, rather than too much government leading

Regenerative fashion is the future of the industry, and the world, he insists.</p><p>It is a fictional scenario, but it is not hard to imagine. Quiet luxury, which was arguably the biggest trend of last year and claimed Roy as its poster boy, is not about logos. Instead, it is about less obvious codes, such as quality cloth and tailoring created with fibres so precious that their provenance and the way they are cultivated is a selling point.

As the latter are set to release their first album since 2014, Albini will be answering your questions.</p><p>While studying for a journalism degree, Albini started Big Black and immersed himself into the music scene of Chicago, embodying punk’s ethos with Big Black’s forthright, abrasive songs and DIY spirit.

<p>Why are more medics treating the same number of patients as before the pandemic? Because the tools we’re using are ancient</p><p>It was a bright hot day in August, and the heaters were stuck on full blast. A nurse on the acute medical ward bleeped my pager. The heart of a patient I’d seen that morning had started palpitating. Soon, my heart was racing too, not out of solidarity but from the seven flights of stairs I had to sprint up. One half of our ward had been relocated seven flights away from the other, after flakes of asbestos started falling from the ceiling.</p><p>Squinting over a trace of the patient’s heart rhythm, I suspected the culprit was potassium – that salt we need just the right amount of, Goldilocks-style, to keep beating. If it’s too high or too low, you’ve got a real problem. A straightforward blood test would contain the information I needed. I travelled across the building to one of just two blood gas analyser machines in the hospital and queued impatiently, o

<p>What do the careers of Diane Abbott, Tony Benn, Jeremy Corbyn, Ken Livingstone and John McDonnell tell us about political success?</p><p>“Persistence,” writes Andy Beckett, “is one of the left’s qualities that its enemies like least.” These hair-shirted zealots spend countless hours meeting, rallying, consciousness-raising, drumming up&nbsp;meagre support for seemingly lost&nbsp;causes. While he was the Greater&nbsp;London Council leader, Ken Livingstone lived alone in a student bedsit, the centrepiece of his room a quarter-sized snooker table on which he would practise shots after a 14-hour working day. Such obsessiveness seems baffling to the unbeliever. Why, they wonder, doesn’t the left just give up?</p><p>This book offers an answer. “Leftwing politics,” Beckett claims, “is rarely the dead end its enemies would love it to be.” He begins in 1968, with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/tony-benn">Tony Benn</a>’s conversion from an on-message cabinet minister into a st
