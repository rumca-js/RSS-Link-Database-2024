Objective-C pointers on macOS are 64 bit, providing plenty of space for representing entire values. If the least significant bit is 1 (the pointer is a 64 bit odd number) then the pointer is \"tagged\" and represents a value, not a memory reference.</p>\n<p>Here's where things get really clever. Storing an integer value up to 60 bits is easy. But what about strings?</p>\n<p>There's enough space for three UTF-16 characters, with 12 bits left over. But if the string fits ASCII we can store 7 characters.</p>\n<p>Drop everything except <code>a-z A-Z.0-9</code> and we need 6 bits per character, allowing 10 characters to fit in the pointer.</p>\n<p>Apple take this a step further: if the string contains just <code>eilotrm.ap", "language": "en-us", "link": "https://simonwillison.net/2024/May/8/tagged-pointer-strings-2015/#atom-everything", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://simonwillison.net/atom/everything", "source_obj__id": 423, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Tagged Pointer Strings (2015)", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-05-08T01:44:26+00:00", "description": "<p><a href=\"https://buttondown.email/geoffreylitt/archive/towards-universal-version-control-with-patchwork/\">Towards universal version control with Patchwork</a></p>\nGeoffrey Litt has been working with Ink &amp; Switch exploring UI patterns for applying version control to different kinds of applications, with the goal of developing a set of conceptual primitives that can bring branching and version tracking to interfaces beyond just Git-style version control.</p>\n\n<p>Geoffrey observes that basic version control is already a metaphor in a lot of software\u2014the undo stack in Photoshop or suggestion mode in Google Docs are two examples.</p>\n\n<p>Extending that is a great way to interact with AI tools as well\u2014allowing for editorial bots that can suggest their own changes for you to accept, for example.\n\n    <p>Via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stevekrouse/status/1787834460358017497\">@stevekrouse</a></p>", "language": "en-us", "link": "https://simonwillison.net/2024/May/8/universal-version-control/#atom-everything", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://simonwillison.net/atom/everything", "source_obj__id": 423, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Towards universal version control with Patchwork", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-05-08T00:33:46+00:00", "description": "<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/nanulled/status/1787938906068885747\">gpt2-chatbot confirmed as OpenAI</a></p>\nThe mysterious <code>gpt2-chatbot</code> model that showed up in the <a href=\"https://chat.lmsys.org/\">LMSYS arena</a> a few days ago was <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2024/Apr/29/notes-on-gpt2-chatbot/\">suspected to be</a> a testing preview of a new OpenAI model.
