<p>Research suggests there are seven JavaScript language elements developers lookup more than any other. While you might not be able to write a complete JavaScript program using only these features, you most certainly won't get far without them. Beginners need to learn them, but they're also great brain refreshers for JavaScript veterans. Let’s take a look at the JavaScript language features every developer needs.</p><h2>The 'most searched' JavaScript language elements</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>for</code> loop</li>
<li><code>map</code></li>
<li><code>foreach</code></li>
<li><code>substring</code></li>
<li><code>array</code></li>
<li><code>switch</code></li>
<li><code>reduce</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Collections of values are an essential aspect of all programming languages. In JavaScript, we use arrays to store collections. JavaScript arrays are incredibly flexible, which is largely due to JavaScript’s dynamic typi

<p>For decades, when I got to work in the morning, I would start Microsoft Visual Studio (or one of its predecessors, such as Visual C++ or Visual InterDev), then brew tea and possibly attend a morning meeting while it went through its laborious startup. I would keep the IDE open all day as I went through develop/test/debug cycles to avoid another startup delay.</p><p>When I worked on a C++ project with ~2 million lines of code, I also jump-started each day’s work by automatically running a batch script that did a code checkout and full rebuild of the product in the wee hours.</p><p>But that was then.

Dividing applications into independent services simplifies development, updates, and scaling. But it also gives you many more moving parts to connect and secure.
