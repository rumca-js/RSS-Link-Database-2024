Combined with some of the tightest platforming in the business and an entrancing visual design, the studio's debut IP was a standout hit, leading to heightened anticipation for its next project. Yet No Rest for the Wicked could not be more different from the enchanting veneer of Ori and the Blind Forest, trading in precise platforming for punishing combat, bright colors for a dark and foreboding medieval world, and tight gameplay for systems that struggle to reign everything in.\n\nNo Rest for the Wicked is relatively rich in terms of content for an early access title, offering over 10 hours of story content and additional late game activities to stretch your playtime well beyond", "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R0zizBwvGk", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "source_obj__id": 127, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/4R0zizBwvGk/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "No Rest For The Wicked Is Brutal And Ambitious, But A Little Confused | Early Access Impressions", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
