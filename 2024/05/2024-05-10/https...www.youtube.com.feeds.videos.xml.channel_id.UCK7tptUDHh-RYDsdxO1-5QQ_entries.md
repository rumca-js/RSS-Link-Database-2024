Imagine if American Idol met the Olympics and was broadcast live to more people than the Super Bowl. That is Eurovision – the world’s largest live music event. 

With up to 20 countries plus interval acts performing live each night, a lot of planning goes into the time between acts. Every few minutes, the stage crew brings props, artists, dancers and pyrotechnics on and off stage all before the cameras cut back to live TV. 

WSJ traveled to Malmö, Sweden to go behind the scenes at Eurovision and follow the incredible high-speed logistics of the 50-second stage change.
