  <p id="jwiwmv">Data centers and offshore wind farms could prove to be a perfect pair as AI grows increasingly energy-hungry. </p>
<p id="RjXPKL">Many of the companies racing to roll out new generative AI tools have also made big commitments to rein in their greenhouse gas emissions. A rush of new AI data centers could throw those climate goals off — unless they find a clean source of energy.</p>
<p id="M0gMZa">Conveniently, some of the quirks with AI data centers make them a good match for wind farms at sea. And the offshore wind industry, which has already cozied up with Big Tech, could

  <p id="E2xzYP">Microsoft has been talking about plans for an Xbox mobile gaming store for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/19/23411972/microsoft-xbox-mobile-store-games">a couple of years now</a>, and the company now plans to launch it in July. Speaking at the Bloomberg Technology Summit earlier today, Xbox president Sarah Bond revealed the launch date and how Microsoft is going to avoid Apple’s strict App Store rules.</p>
<p id="nL97Xd">“We’re going to start by bringing our own first-party portfolio to [the Xbox mobile store], so you’re going to see games like <em>Candy Crush </em>show up in that experience, games like <em>Minecraft,” </em>says Bond<em>. “</em>We’re going
