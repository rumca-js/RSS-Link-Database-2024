During a celebration of the best in Pacific Northwest tech, the community came together to pack the Showbox SoDo to network, eat and drink, pose for photos and cheer on the finalists and winners in a variety of categories.

The annual event, now in its 15th year, brought a sold-out crowd to Showbox SoDo in Seattle, where more than 60 finalists across a dozen categories competed for awards ranging from Startup of the Year to Next Tech Titan to Workplace of the Year, and more. Much like it has been for the past year, artificial intelligence was a recurring buzzword running through the evening,&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2024/geekwire-awards-2024-revealed-winners-bask-in-momentum-of-ai-and-potential-of-region/\">Read More</a>", "language": "en-US", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2024/geekwire-awards-2024-revealed-winners-bask-in-momentum-of-ai-and-potential-of-region", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed", "source_obj__id": 131, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "GeekWire Awards 2024 revealed: Winners bask in momentum of AI and potential of region", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-05-10T00:20:55+00:00", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"836\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/DSC09399-1260x836.jpg\" width=\"1260\" /><br />In a surprise reveal, Microsoft said Thursday it plans to launch a mobile gaming store later this year. The news came out during an on-stage interview with Xbox president Sarah Bond at a Bloomberg event. According to Bond, the as-yet-unnamed store will launch in July on web browsers, rather than a designated app, with Microsoft\u2019s recently-acquired Candy Crush Saga serving as a day-one tentpole franchise. Microsoft&#8217;s entry into the mobile gaming market \u2014\u00a0the most lucrative arm of the games industry \u2014\u00a0has been anticipated, particularly since the company&#8217;s recent $69 billion acquisition of California-based mega-developer Activision Blizzard King.

The Seattle City Council\u2019s governance, accountability, and economic development committee approved a new ordinance, which will now move to a full council vote on May 28. Since the existing minimum pay law went into effect in January, tech giants including Uber and DoorDash responded by adding new fees for consumers, which caused demand to\u00a0drop\u00a0considerably. They also amped up lobbying efforts at City Hall, and their chief executive officers spoke against the law in response to questions from analysts&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2024/revised-minimum-wage-law-for-delivery-drivers-moves-forward-in-seattle-set-for-full-council-v", "language": "en-US", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2024/revised-minimum-wage-law-for-delivery-drivers-moves-forward-in-seattle-set-for-full-council-vote", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed", "source_obj__id": 131, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Revised minimum wage law for delivery drivers moves forward in Seattle, set for full council vote", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
