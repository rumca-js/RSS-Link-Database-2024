Most smart home device makers have a plug or two in their lineups, but finding one that\u2019s compatible with your chosen ecosystem, easy to set up and reliably connects can involve a little trial and error. That\u2019s why we tried more than a dozen models to find the best smart plugs you can buy right now.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-what-to-consider-when-buying-a-smart-plug\">What to consider when buying a smart plug</h2>\n<p>Before you buy o", "language": "en-US", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/best-smart-plug-131542429.html?src=rss", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "source_obj__id": 104, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2024-04%2F481fb230-f2a0-11ee-a33f-c4286617e105&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=07b6763cfa8b52c8cb3c83d90d09ff849c6e37f5", "title": "The best smart plugs in 2024", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
