Melanoma, an aggressive form of skin cancer that accounts for 75% of all skin-cancer-related deaths, is often detected later in people with darker skin complexions -- and the consequences can be devastating, a new study reveals.

New research into molten rock 20km below the Earth's surface could help save lives by improving the prediction of volcanic activity.

## ERR-gamma 'trains' stomach stem cells to become acid-producing cells

Researchers have identified molecular and genetic pathways that direct the generation and maturation of parietal cells, the only cells in the body that produce acid, from stem cells. The findings can lead to new strategies to regulate parietal cell function in different diseases involving these cells, including autoimmune gastritis and stomach and esophageal cancers.

## AI systems are already skilled at deceiving and manipulating humans

Many artificial intelligence (AI) systems have already learned how to deceive humans, even systems that have been trained to be helpful and honest. Researchers describe the risks of deception by AI systems and call for governments to develop strong regulations to address this issue as soon as possible.

## Rolling with the punches: How mantis shrimp defend against high-speed strikes

Mantis shrimp are small creatures known for their superlatives. Their eyes have 12 to 16 different color receptors, versus our own three, and can detect the polarization of light. Their punches are famously fast, accelerating on par with a 22-caliber bullet. They use these strikes on prey, predators and competitors alike.
