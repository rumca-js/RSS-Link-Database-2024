On this week's episode of the podcast, freeCodeCamp founder Quincy Larson interviews Gary Simon, a developer and designer who started DesignCourse.com and has published several courses on freeCodeCamp.org over the years.

We talk about:
- Growing up in rural Ohio, marrying young, and staying out there despite his success as a developer and entrepreneur.
- Early client work, and how he designed thousands of logos for clients before becoming an all-out web developer.
- Using his skills to help his wife start her own lactation consultant business online
- Gary's guitar shredding chops.
