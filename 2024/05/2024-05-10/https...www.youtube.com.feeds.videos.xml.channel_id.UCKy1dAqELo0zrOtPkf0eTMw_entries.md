Hades 2 might be in early access, but it’s chock full of enemies to beat, gods to meet, and secrets to seek…out. If you’re just jumping into the roguelike for the first time, there are several things you are going to want to know to make your runs more successful -- things the game itself doesn’t tell you. And if you’re coming into the sequel from the first game, you can still benefit from this guide because there are plenty of additions to the Hades formula here. Let’s break it down.

## Homeworld 3 Single-Player Campaign Review

Homeworld 3 Single-Player Campaign reviewed by Dan Stapleton on PC.
Homeworld 3’s campaign goes out of its way to change up the style of missions we fight our way through as Imogen S’jet seeks out a missing Hiigaran fleet and faces an unhinged enemy. The resulting battle of wills feels more consequential than the off-screen galactic threat behind it. Relatively close-quarters scenarios have you guiding dozens of ships through eye catching gauntlets of asteroids and enormous space stations, and the dogfights and capital ship slug-fests that play out are a sight to behold. Being able to pause time and give orders makes managing your fleet much less overwhelming, especially given the tricky controls and sometimes disobedient friendly ship AI. Straightforward tech upgrades and a limited selection of ship types limit the campaign’s replayability, but building an armada and watching it tear through the enemy is always a satisfying sci-fi light show.
