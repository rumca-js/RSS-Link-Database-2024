Lightning Talk: Making Friends With CUDA Programmers (please constexpr all the things) - Vasu Agrawal - CppCon 2023
https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2023

The `--expt-relaxed-constexpr` flag in nvcc allows `constexpr` code to be used on device, removing the need for explicit __device__ annotations. I'll encourage library authors to annotate more code as `constexpr`, allowing CUDA C++ programmers to use the library directly (rather than writing their own), saving work and thus making friends.
