I want to capture the feel of a real live conversation, with all the human quirks that entails.\n\nCan you guess what song I'm playing on my bass during the intro? It's from a 1995s Nintendo game.\n\nBe sure to follow The freeCodeCamp podcast in your favorite podcast app. And share this podcast with a friend.
