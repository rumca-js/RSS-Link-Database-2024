The resulting battle of wills feels more consequential than the off-screen galactic threat behind it. Relatively close-quarters scenarios have you guiding dozens of ships through eye catching gauntlets of asteroids and enormous space stations, and the dogfights and capital ship slug-fests that play out are a sight to behold. Being able to pause time and give orders makes managing your fleet much less overwhelming, especially given the tricky controls and sometimes disobedient friendly ship AI.
