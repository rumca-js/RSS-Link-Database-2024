Pal, then working primarily as a screenwriter, went to interview Ward, whose storied&nbsp;London venue was a cradle of&nbsp;alternative comedy in the 1980s. He&nbsp;told Pal that press coverage was all&nbsp;well and good, but what he really needed was performers. The initial plan – flying British comics out to India&nbsp;– would be too costly to maintain long-term, which meant he had to find talent, fast. Would Pal audition for him?</p><p>Pal agreed but remained sceptical. “I remember telling my family: ‘This is just a little hobby, I don’t think English comedy’s going t

The American Kennel Club might have the answer</p><p>Stephen Rodrick’s interview with Paul Schrader in Variety is a thing of great heft.

But that isn’t why people will remember it. No, they will remember the interview because, out of nowhere, Martin Scorsese’s dog eats Paul Schrader’s finger.</p><p>During one of their conversations for the piece, late last year, Schrader turned up for dinner with “a massive, bloody bandage” wrapped around his hand.

Build a cafe that serves short stacks of chunky, fat pancakes smothered in banoffee syrup and topped with mini meringues, shards of tempered chocolate, quenelles of thick cream and microplaned lemon zest, and they will come. Post a video on TikTok of someone blowtorching said pancake stack, so the meringue browns and gives the whole hot mess a baked alaska vibe, however, and your customers will queue from 8am for the chance to make their own content next to the fake plastic trees “growing” inside the cafe.</p><p>Sugar is the most cheerily pernicious of vices.

<p>Candles in jars, night-scented plants and a stash of blankets make for magical, unfussy dinners with friends</p><p>One warm mid-spring weekend is all it takes&nbsp;for me to start conjuring up evenings dining in the garden. Not the usual solitary potter around with a drink in one hand and a pair of secateurs in the other (we are on the cusp of deadheading season, when the best ornamentals will produce another flush if the spent flowers are removed). This is very pleasant, but I’m talking about those longer soirees that unfurl from glorious afternoons into alfresco cosiness.</p><p>I love entertaining outside. For one, it’s more practical: when I lived in a&nbsp;chaotic shared house in London a&nbsp;decade ago, outdoor parties were always preferred because the clean-up never involved mopping.

It wasn’t her first time witnessing clashes of protesters and counter-protesters on the lawns of the august Ivy League school.</p><p>In 1968, Stein was one of 700 students arrested at Columbia during protests targeting both the university’s ties to the US military apparatus at the height of the Vietnam war, and the college’s plan to build a segregated gym, at the height of the civil rights movement. “This was really a crisis moment,” Stein, 78, recalls. “Students were taking a moral stand.

<p>The baggier leg shape is essential, so that the top and bottom halves mirror each other</p><p>It is useful to have a few tried-and-tested formulas you can rely on for those times when you need an outfit that just works. Think of them like the wardrobe equivalent of your go-to recipes. When you get home from work hungry, you need a few quick and easy dinner ideas in your back pocket so that when you open the&nbsp;fridge you don’t need to think too&nbsp;hard. Same goes for clothes.</p><p>Don’t get me wrong. I love to open my wardrobe with no preconceived idea of what I am going to wear and put&nbsp;an outfit together on a whim – but no way do I want to do that every day. That would be exhausting. Again, it’s a bit like making dinner. You may be a keen cook who loves to try out new recipes, but that doesn’t mean you want to be rummaging around at the back of the store cupboard for gochujang or date molasses every night. Sometimes your brain needs a&nbsp;break and you want to get dress

The trio’s biggest hit to date – 2022’s Bad Love – was a smoke machine-fogged rush of instant-singalong glam. Now, their fifth album arrives in a swirl of bratty pop-punk: opener Dog Days’ stop-start guitars accompany pouty playground-chant lyrics dripping with teenage melodrama. Later, they turn to sweeping, big-chorused Americana (Hard to Love), combine slacker indie and vintage soul for the irresistible Mood Ring – a sleazy, cheesy tale of unexpectedly reciprocated lust – and, on Necklace, cleverly meld country and grunge, the exaggerated scuzz offsetting sugary-sweet melodic hooks.</p><p>Contemporary guitar music is
