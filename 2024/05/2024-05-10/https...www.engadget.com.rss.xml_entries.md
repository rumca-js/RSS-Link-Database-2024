<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-hw-q990c-soundbar-review-an-all-inclusive-atmos-setup-160049530.html">Samsung’s HW-Q990C</a> was the best overall soundbar I tested last year, mostly due to its stellar audio and the fact that a subwoofer and rear speakers came with it. The company didn’t change much for the 2024 version, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsungs-q990d-soundbar-has-the-one-thing-the-2023-version-didnt-hdmi-21-030059753.html">the HW-Q990D</a>, but one tweak delivers a feature last year’s model should’ve had: HDMI 2.1. There are some new audio modes too, but you can find those on other Samsung soundbars. The Q990D is as powerful as ever, but it’s still pricey at <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3

<p>Swiss start-up Climeworks has done it again. The company just opened the world’s largest carbon capture plant in Iceland, dwarfing its own record of how much CO2 it can pull from the air. The company’s previous record-holding carbon capture plant, Orca, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/worlds-largest-carbon-capture-plant-185556109.html"><ins>sucks around 4,000 tons of CO2</ins></a> from the atmosphere per year, but the new plant can handle nearly ten times that, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/2024/05/09/climeworks-mammoth-carbon-capture/"><ins>as reported by </ins><em><ins>The Washington Post</ins></em></a>.</p>
<p>The plant’s called Mammoth and boasts 72 industrial fans that can pull 36,000 tons of CO2 from the air each year. Just like with Orca, the CO2 isn’t recycled. It’s stored underground and eventually trapped in stone, permanently (within reason) removing it from the environment. The plant’s actually located on a dormant volcano, so it’ll make a

The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-05-sonos-one-sl-port.html"><ins>Sonos One SL</ins></a>, for instance, doesn't have a microphone.

<p>They say &quot;Twitter isn't real life,&quot; but Black Twitter proved otherwise. For years, that phrase has been a way to ignore the real-world impact of social media conversations, especially when they spark radically new ideas. But that's clearly not true when you look at Black Twitter, an unofficial community made up of the site's black users, which inspired culturally significant movements with hashtags like <a href="https://library.law.howard.edu/civilrightshistory/BLM">#BlackLivesMatter</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/06/movies/oscarssowhite-history.html">#OscarsSoWhite.</a> Hulu's new documentary, &quot;Black Lives Matter: A People's History,&quot; adapted from <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/black-twitter-oral-history-part-i-coming-together/">Jason Parham's Wired article</a>, explores the rise and global influence of the community. Over the course of three engaging and often hilarious episodes, the series cements itself as an essential cultural docume

<p>Google has <a href="https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2024/05/stable-channel-update-for-desktop_9.html"><ins>released a security update</ins></a> for the Chrome browser to fix a zero-day vulnerability exploit that has been used by threat actors. This is the fifth time this year the company has had to issue a patch for one of these vulnerabilities, <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/google-fixes-fifth-chrome-zero-day-vulnerability-exploited-in-attacks-in-2024/"><ins>as reported by </ins><em><ins>Bleeping Computer</ins></em></a>.</p>
<p>&quot;Google is aware that an exploit for CVE-2024-4671 exists in the wild,&quot; the company said in a short advisory. It did not issue any specifics as to the nature of the real-world attack or the identity of the threat actors. This is common for Google, as it likes to wait until a majority of users have updated the software before announcing specific details.</p>

<p>A Prince of Persia game from the studio behind <em>Dead Cells</em> was supposed to hit early access on PC on May 14. That’s no longer the case. Evil Empire says <a href="https://www.engadget.com/a-new-prince-of-persia-game-is-coming-from-the-studio-behind-dead-cells-184040223.html"><em><ins>The Rogue Prince of Persia</ins></em><ins>’s</ins></a> debut is delayed until later this month, and it’s because of a little game called <em>Hades II</em>.</p>

<p>As rumors foretold, Apple has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apples-thinner-new-ipad-pros-feature-the-m4-chip-and-tandem-oled-displays-142031520.html">revamped the iPad Pro</a> with an M4 chip, tandem OLED screen and a thinner case.

In this week's episode, Cherlynn and Devindra discuss how Apple is shining a new light on tablets (which also includes the new iPad Air models) and reworking its vision of mobile computing. Does anyone really need the iPad Pro today? And could it be more compelling if iPadOS improves its multitasking capabilities?

## The Morning After: Apple apologizes for its iPad Pro ad that crushed human creativity

<p>Apple has apologized for its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-apologizes-for-its-tone-deaf-ad-that-crushed-human-creativity-to-make-an-ipad-211116524.html">Crush! </a>ad, which sparked a furious backlash among artists, musicians, and other creators. <em>AdAge</em> reports Apple said the video “missed the mark,” and it has scrapped plans to run the commercial on TV. The video shows a series of musical instruments and other tools for human expression, including a guitar, drums, trumpet, amplifiers, record player, TV and much more being crushed to “All I Ever Need Is You” by Sonny and Cher. The crusher pulls up to reveal an iPad. Tonally, you could see how it could be misconstrued.</p>
<p>Apple is rumored to have more AI tricks planned for its next WWDC, while this new iPad Pro has a chip that boasts a lot of AI power, all with the looming threat of AI to creatives.</p>

<p>In a couple of months, you'll be able to get Microsoft's mobile games from its own store. Xbox President Sarah Bond has <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-09/microsoft-to-launch-mobile-game-store-vying-with-apple-google?sref=10lNAhZ9">revealed</a> at the Bloomberg Technology Summit that the company is launching a web-based store where you can download its mobile games and get add-ons or in-app purchases at a discount. Bond said the company has decided to launch a browser-based store instead of an app to make it &quot;accessible across all devices, all countries, no matter what&quot; so that you don't get &quot;locked to a single ecosystem.&quot;</p>
<p>Microsoft will only host its own games to start with, which means it will feature a lot of titles from Activision Blizzard. If you'll recall, it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-now-officially-belongs-to-microsoft-125053787.html">snapped up</a> the gaming developer and publisher in a $70 bil

## The best smart plugs in 2024

<p>Smart plugs aren’t the most complicated <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-smart-home-devices-154557162.html">smart home devices</a> — they really just turn stuff off and on — but they do make life a little easier. That’s what most people probably want from household automation anyway. In the past year or so of testing smart plugs, I’ve grown accustomed to having the living room lamps click on just before sunset and go off when I say goodnight to Alexa or the Google Assistant (Siri can turn off a few of my lights, but isn’t compatible with all of them). Most smart home device makers have a plug or two in their lineups, but finding one that’s compatible with your chosen ecosystem, easy to set up and reliably connects can involve a little trial and error. That’s why we tried more than a dozen models to find the best smart plugs you can buy right now.</p>
