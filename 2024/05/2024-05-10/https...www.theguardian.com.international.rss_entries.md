<p>Intrigue, mind games and a credible chance of Manchester City slipping up are all missing from this supposedly epic battle</p><p>Hello, hello. Testing. Is this thing still on? As we head into the penultimate weekend of the Premier League season, a title race does putatively <em>appear</em> to exist. Arsenal are top, a point ahead of Manchester City. City have a game in hand. Mathematically speaking, nothing yet is decided or settled.</p><p>What remains to be seen, of course, is whether this is actually a real title race, or whether we are simply living through a skilfully maintained illusion. After all, it’s almost three months since City dropped points against anybody other than a direct title rival. They haven’t lost in the league since December and are on a run of six straight wins. Three more will be enough to retain the league title. Two will do if Arsenal slip up at&nbsp;Old&nbsp;Trafford on Sunday.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/may/10/premier

All it is is a little grassroots page. I’ve seen loads of kids posting that they’re referees and they’re starting their GCSEs. Posts normally get three or four likes. All I wanted to do was just to post that you struggled with your GCSEs to show them that anything is possible and to just to keep going. I didn’t think it would get this many likes so quickly,’” says Dennington. She said goodbye, turned off her phone and went to work.

He was already a star among balletomanes thanks to his decade as a principal dancer for the New York City Ballet. But the French-born dancer’s on-screen role in the film, and subsequent marriage to its star Natalie Portman, also turned him into a cooler, sexier poster boy for an artform with a reputation for being cloistered and fussy.</p><p>In the decade since, Millepied has worked seemingly tirelessly to break down the barriers between classical dance and a contemporary audience, chiefly through his own company, <a href="https://ladanceproject.org/#new-page-1">L.A.

Great reviews. <em>And</em> a dog.</p><p>Yet fail – or at least stumble – the The Fall Guy did. David Leitch’s bells and whistles blockbuster was tracked to make $40m at the US box office on its opening weekend. Instead, it landed just shy of $28m: a soft opening echoed overseas, where it picked up $30m across 68 other territories. Its current global total stands at $70m.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/article/2024/may/10/blunt-gosling-the-fall-guy-box-office-flop-cinema">Continue reading...</a>

His hopes of a more level playing feel may comes to fruition</p><p>For much of the final 14 of his 22 years at Arsenal, Arsène Wenger was a study in frustration. The free thinker who brought trophies and glory to Arsenal in his blazing first eight years at the club, ushering in a revolution across the Premier League with his use of data, approach to talent scouting, commitment to technically intricate football and careful attention to the diet and lifestyle of the players under his watch, was suddenly transformed into a snippy crank. The sideline fiddling with his parka zipper, the tetchy press conference responses, the comic insistence that he “almost” signed every successful player in Europe, the disgusted tossing of the tiny water bottle as his once-invincible team gave away another lead, endured another slapstick mishap at the back, squandered another title challenge: the visual lore of Late Wenger
