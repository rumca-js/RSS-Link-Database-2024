<p>Most enthusiasts know that a PC&rsquo;s CPU will throttle down to prevent overheating. GPUs and even most PCIe 50. SSDs ship with huge heat sinks and blowers. But the latest casualty of thermal throttling might be the PCI Express bus itself &mdash; which is being programmed to reduce the link speed or even shut off some of its lanes.</p>



<p>That&rsquo;s the eyebrow-raising scenario that a new driver from Intel suggests. <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.phoronix.com/news/Intel-PCIe-Cooling-Driver-2024&amp;xcust=2-1-2329986-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Phoronix</a>, which has been monitoring Intel&rsquo;s development of a PCI Express driver for Linux, noted that the latest revision allows limiting the PCI Express link speed in case of thermal pressure. The key term is &ldquo;bwctrl.&rdquo

<p>When the Eurovision finals kick off on Saturday, software nerds will have something to look forward to: a Finnish guy named &ldquo;Windows95man&rdquo; decked out in Microsoft gear, belting out a song titled &ldquo;No Rules.&rdquo;</p>



<p>If you&rsquo;re a typical American, Eurovision seems like a fever dream. It&rsquo;s a bunch of largely European countries sending singers and artists to compete in a sort of Euro World Cup of odd, artsy performances. Will Farrell&rsquo;s Netflix hit <em>Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga</em> nailed the vibe, and Windows95man&rsquo;s No Rules feels very much in the spirit of it &mdash; the guy emerges from a giant egg, for crying out loud.</p>



<p>Since Eurovision is Europe only, there&rsquo;s always a bit of regionalism; Americans can&rsquo;t watch the finals live without a VPN. (Our <a href="https://www.pcworl

<p>External USB/Thunderbolt drives are a super-convenient way to quickly back up your important files, as well as store any data that you don&rsquo;t need on your computer&rsquo;s internal storage. They&rsquo;re also an extremely handy way to transport data between locations and devices.</p>



<p>While any of these would be a great reason to pick up an external drive, the advantages of having reliable backup is the number-one reason your setup isn&rsquo;t complete without one. Why? Chances are you have important data on your PC that you can&rsquo;t afford to lose. To protect that data you&rsquo;ll want to do two things: <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407149/online-cloud-backup-services-carbonite-idrive-backblaze-livedrive.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">store it off-site on the cloud</a> if possible and back it up to an external drive.

<p>Man, there seem to be a lot of high-profile issues with the Chrome browser lately. Google issued an update yesterday with a security patch for an &ldquo;in the wild&rdquo; bug that exploits a use after free error. The good news is that the fix is being applied just two days after it was discovered by an anonymous user. The bad news is that this is becoming depressingly frequent. </p>



<p>As <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/google-fixes-fifth-chrome-zero-day-vulnerability-exploited-in-attacks-in-2024/&amp;xcust=2-1-2329804-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">BleepingComputer reports</a>, this is the fifth time in 2024 that Google has needed to issue an urgent update for Chrome, following no less than three zero-day exploits discovered at the Pwn2Own contest in

<p>I live in an itty-bitty, creaky old house, so there are never enough wall outlets. The builders of the 1980s could never predict that someday a work-from-home nerd with a desk that looks like something out of NASA Mission Control would live here. So anything that can boost my plug-in power is welcome. For example, this mini surge protector with extra USB power, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08XZNCHHD?th=1&amp;xcust=2-1-2329702-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">under ten bucks today at Amazon</a>. </p>



<p>This isn&rsquo;t the kind of thing that can power my main desk on its own, but it&rsquo;s great for adding some extra power in a small space, like behind my TV. In addition to six standard AC outlets, you get two USB-A ports and a USB-C port, though at 2.1 amps total across

<p>You can&rsquo;t get a lot of laptop for three hundred bucks, unless you&rsquo;re looking for a Chromebook or a twelve-year-old refurbished Mac off Woot. But today, you might be able to get <em>juuuust </em>enough, at least if you&rsquo;re hunting for a budget model. The Acer Aspire 3, which has been PCWorld&rsquo;s favorite budget laptop for the last year or so, is <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3B114DV&amp;xcust=2-1-2329635-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">down to just $299.99 on Amazon</a>. </p>



<p>In his review (which is the exact same configuration, hey neat), Robert Strohmeyer praised the Aspire 3&rsquo;s long battery life, decent performance, and surprisingly good webcam, while noting that you&rsquo;re not gonna get tons of gaming done with basic integrated graphics

<p>The default pasting behavior of Microsoft Word is a nightmare, and has been forever. If you want to add a text or image using the standard option, you can easily mess up the entire formatting in the text if a completely different font suddenly appears. The horror!</p>



<p>After many years of complaints, Microsoft is finally listening to user feedback and changing the default behavior when pasting in Word. From now on, the source&rsquo;s formatting will no longer be automatically retained. Instead, &ldquo;Merge formatting&rdquo; will be the new default for everyone, as Microsoft explained in a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://insider.microsoft365.com/en-us/blog/updated-default-paste-option-in-word-for-windows&amp;xcust=2-1-2329636-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">blog post this we
