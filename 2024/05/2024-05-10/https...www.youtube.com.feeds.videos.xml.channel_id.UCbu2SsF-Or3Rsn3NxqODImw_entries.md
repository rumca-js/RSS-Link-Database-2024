Build this suppressed AK with an ACOG and never want for ammo.

The starting M4 in Gray Zone can sing once you slap an ACOG on it but it still shoots 5.56, which enemies don’t carry, meaning you’re always running out. Initially, you can pick up random AKs off the ground but they don’t take optics. The best of both worlds is your own custom-built AK plus 7.62 ammo scavenged from enemy forces. This video shows you what vendors to focus on right away to unlock the ability to create your own custom weapon with a suppressor and magnified optic. This build has multiple advantages with range and lower enemy awareness. Gray Zone Warfare, a tactical PvEvP FPS, is out now in early access on Steam.

Animal Well delights with its non-traditional approach to Metroidvanias, combining unique items with a reactive and surreal world that's full of surprises.

It's usually pretty easy to predict how a 2D Metroidvania is going to play out. At some point, you'll probably unlock a double or even triple jump to reach previously inaccessible areas, obtain an air dash that helps you traverse large gaps and pass through specific blockades, and acquire a weapon upgrade that functions as both a killing tool and a way to progress past certain obstacles. Animal Well contains most of these things, but never in ways that are expected. Created by solo developer Billy Basso and published by Bigmode, Animal Well is a surrealist puzzle platformer that's delightfully surprising. Even if its pixelated art style and genre trappings make it seem familiar on the surface, it is a game that often eschews conventional wisdom and stands out because of it.

It's impressive that this is the lone blemish on an othe
