So Microsoft (or Xbox) decided to shut down four Bethesda studios. People are not happy. 

Studios that made games like Hi Fi rush are now dust in the wind and I want answers.

But I won’t get them.

So I’ll just guess.

I want to talk about the state of Xbox, what it might mean for the future, and where I think this is all heading.

Honestly, probably to the PlayStation.
