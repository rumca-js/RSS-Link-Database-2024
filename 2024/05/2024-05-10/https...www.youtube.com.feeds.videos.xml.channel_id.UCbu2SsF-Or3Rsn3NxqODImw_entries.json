At some point, you'll probably unlock a double or even triple jump to reach previously inaccessible areas, obtain an air dash that helps you traverse large gaps and pass through specific blockades, and acquire a weapon upgrade that functions as both a killing tool and a way to progress past certain obstacles. Animal Well contains most of these things, but never in ways that are expected. Created by solo developer Billy Basso and published by Bigmode, Animal Well is a surrealist puzzle platformer that's delightfully surprising. Even if its pixelated art style and genre trappings make it seem familiar on the surface, it is a game that often eschews conventional wisdom and stands out because of it.\n\nIt's impressive that this is the lone blemish on an othe", "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCNbnSBKCZo", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "source_obj__id": 127, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/TCNbnSBKCZo/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Animal Well GameSpot Review", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
