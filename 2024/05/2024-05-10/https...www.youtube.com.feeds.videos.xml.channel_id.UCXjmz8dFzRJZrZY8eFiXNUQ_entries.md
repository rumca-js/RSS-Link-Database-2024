The Planet of the Apes franchise has a long and storied history.  From it's original films starring Charlton Heston to the Tim Burton reboot, to the modern trilogy directed by The Batman's Matt Reeves, The Planet of the Apes have seen several different iterations.  Though the new trilogy including Rise of the Planet of the Apes, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, and War for the Planet of the Apes seem to be overlooked in the scope of modern action franchises.  Will Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes move the needle at all?  Will Hollywood finally recognize this franchise for the masterpiece that it is?
