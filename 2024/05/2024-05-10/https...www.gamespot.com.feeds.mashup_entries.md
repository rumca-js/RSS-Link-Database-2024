<p>Nintendo isn't big on discounting its games or hardware, and it's not unusual to see products listed at full price years after launch. That's often the case for Switch consoles, as you don't often see worthwhile price cuts unless it's a big shopping holiday. However, if you know where to look, it is possible to get meaningful discounts on Nintendo Switch consoles. Outside of buying from a friend or local seller, one of your best options is eBay, as there are huge distributors with bulk stock of new Nintendo hardware.</p><p>From the OLED Model and Lite to the original Nintendo Switch, here's a look at the best deals at eBay. Keep in mind that <strong>all of the console deals from eBay listed below are Japanese imports</strong>, but because the platform is region-free, outside of some text on the box, there isn't a tangible difference between these and the ones you'll find at your local GameStop. As long as that isn't a dealbreaker, you can get special-edition consoles that often sel

<p>Apple announced a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apple-ipad-pro-ipad-air-2024-preorder-guide/1100-6523258/">new line of iPad Pro and iPad Air models this week</a>, and as you'd expect, these premium tablets to command a very high price. While it might be hard to justify spending this much cash on this hardware, the good news is that the older--and still highly capable--older iPad models have gotten a nice discount. Apple has reduced the MSRP on the 10th-gen iPad by $100, and if you're looking for a multimedia device to watch some Netflix on or play a few rounds of Marvel Snap, this will do just fine. In comparison, the new iPad Pro tablets are workhorse machines designed to give creative people and professionals a robust tool to perform multiple tasks on, hence their higher price.</p><p>That's not to say that you can't use an older iPad for similar tasks, as the A14 bionic chip can still deliver an impressive amount of power and performance.
