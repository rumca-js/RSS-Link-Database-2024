Marathon, the 1994 video game that marked Halo and Destiny developer Bungie's first foray into the world of first-person sci-fi shooters, is - as Bungie previously <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marathon-fan-revival-coming-to-steam-with-bungies-blessing">said it would be</a> - now available on Steam for free. And the remaining two titles in the series are due at a later date.
</p><p>
Marathon Classic, as the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2398450/Classic_Marathon/">Steam release</a> is known, has been developed by the team behind Aleph One - a fan-created engine based on the Marathon 2 source code - and promises "authentic gameplay using the original [Marathon] data files". However, it also features optional widescreen HUD support, 3D filtering/perspective, positional audio, and 60+ fps interpolation, "just in case," as t

Among Us, the sci-fi social deduction game that singlehandedly brought the phrase "sus" back into style, has just received a <a href="https://www.innersloth.com/the-among-us-2024-roadmap/">new roadmap</a> teasing a fresh set of features for 2024 as developer Innersloth continues its murderous rampage across the stars.
</p><p>
It's probably the announcement new roles are on the way - the first since 2021 - that'll be met with the most fan excitement. And while Innersloth has offered no hints as to what they might be, it notes each will feature "their own little quirk that makes for some very interesting lobbies." New roles, it says, are coming "soon".
</p><p>
Further into the year, Innersloth is adding better lobby filtering that'll feature a "more refined" set of search settings, alongside a bit of be

Alongside technology that sets the groundwork for future iterations of the engine, developer Epic Games is promising substantial performance improvements with better CPU utilisation, potentially solving a common bugbear we've seen on PC and consoles this generation. Of course, the new release also includes visual improvements, including to the Nanite geometry system and Temporal Super Resolution (TSR) upscaling. We've tested this latest engine revision to see how everything works and to get a sense of the kind of performance improvements that might be possible in the new version. </p><p>As stunning as it was, the first Matrix Awakens Unreal Engine 5.0 demo back in 2021 already exhibited the core performance issues that Epic is looking to address with 5.4.

Are you a cosy game addict? Welcome in and take a seat among your fellow enablers as I, fellow addict Zoe Delahunty-Light, kick off my new weekly series Cozy Corner! This series follows me as I finally try to clear my backlog of 47 (and counting) cosy games in my steam library, and decide whether these games are relaxing enough to warrant the label 'cosy' at all. Cosy games have blown up over the last four years and because of it, there are more to try than ever before, and thus more competing for your attention. I'm going to find the best of the best so tune in for this new weekly series full of blankets, relaxation - I hope - and surprisingly harsh judgement.
</p><p>
Garden Life: A Cozy Simulator is the first game that's being subjected to the cosy interrogation. In it, you are responsible for bringing back life to the dilapidated garden

The forthcoming The Rogue Prince of Persia has been delayed by developer Evil Empire to allow players more time with Hades 2.

The roguelite game was originally set for early access release next week on 14th May, but has now been delayed to later in the month, with a precise date coming on Monday.
</p><p>
Why? <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-2-early-access-review">Hades 2 entered early access at the start of the week</a> and Evil Empire doesn't want to compete.

Xbox president Sarah Bond has responded to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-shuts-slew-of-bethesda-studios-including-redfall-hi-fi-rush-developers">recent studio cuts at Bethesda</a>, describing the decision as "our commitment to make sure that the business is healthy for the long term".
</p><p>
Bond was interviewed at the Bloomberg Tech Summit yesterday, following the news earlier this week Microsoft has closed a number of Bethesda studios: Arkane Austin, Tango Gameworks, and Alpha Dog Games.
</p><p>
However, the interview has since gone viral due to Bond's seemingly weak answers that provide little insight into the decision.

Investors that put money, or buy shares, in a business want to make money on their investment. And for that to happen the company's 'value' needs to go up. It needs to grow bigger. Growth could be many things, but it typically refers to revenue (the amount of money a company generates) or profit (the amount of money a company makes after costs). And to investors, a loss-making company that is getting bigger every year is more exciting than a profitable business that is going the other way. 
</p><p>
This may sound obvious, but we're about to get into why <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-shuts-slew-of-bethesda-studios-including-redfall-hi-fi-rush-developers">Xbox just closed three Bethesda studios</a>.

Just days after a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/poppy-playtime-book-out-now-promises-exclusive-secrets">Poppy Playtime book was released</a>, a film adaptation of the cult horror series has been announced.

</p><p>
The game's developer, Mob Entertainment, is working with Legendary Entertainment (which counts Dune: Part Two, Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire among recent hits) as well as Angry Films (the Transformers series among others).
</p><p>
The film is presumably a ways off yet, but is yet another move outside games for the Poppy Playtime franchise.

It is a landscape littered with well-intentioned armchair warriors, white people, privileged expats, weird nationalists, and foetid trolls; everyone disagrees almost all of the time, with some <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/david-chang-momofuku-will-no-longer-enforce-chili-crunch-trademark-rcna147838">blessed exceptions that bring people around the world together to ridicule a clown</a>. Diaspora discourse might involve the fraying borders of a motherland or a monoculture, authenticity, racism, accents and code-switching, and dozens of other things that remain wholly untranslatable to an outside party. The psychology at play is a weird chimaera that can never be a

Stray Gods, the game musical from Dragon Age writer David Gaider, is getting surprise DLC.

The DLC will focus on rockstar Orpheus, performed by actor Anthony Rapp (Star Trek: Discovery, Rent), as he's returned to the world of the living by Hermes.
</p><p>
It's described as a "comedic feature length experience" and will continue the Greek myth story of the main game. It's set for release on 27th June on PC, with a console release to follow.

Before then, games weren't particularly concerned with the mundanities of survival, presumably in the name of what they thought was fun. Games were for extraordinary adventures, not ordinary ones. But Minecraft changed that. It made a feature of finding food and keeping yourself fed, and not thirsty, and it introduced us to a gameplay loop revolving around it. Make a shelter to survive the night, make a set of equipment, and then when you've got a stable footing in the world, you can find myriad ways to upgrade every part of that.</p><p>To say that the idea caught on would be an enormous understatement. Minecraft was an era-defining moment. It propell
