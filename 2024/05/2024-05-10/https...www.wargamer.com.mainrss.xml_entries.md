								<p>Games Workshop and developer Saber Interactive have kept studiously silent about whether we'll get a <strong>Space Marine 2 PVP multiplayer</strong> mode when the game launches in September - but I have faith that the Emperor will provide. While we're waiting, let's review three features I think would make SM2's PVP as awesome as possible (and how likely, or otherwise, they are).</p>

								<p>On Thursday, actual play DnD&nbsp;video&nbsp;channel Critical Role announced a new membership subscription service, Critical Role Beacon, which offers fans exclusive content and early access to some products. But&nbsp;though it&rsquo;s&nbsp;a premium service&nbsp;attached to a big name in digital DnD,&nbsp;don&rsquo;t expect something like&nbsp;Dimension 20&rsquo;s&nbsp;Dropout TV&nbsp;&ndash; this one&rsquo;s for superfans only.

## DnD Vecna: Eve of Ruin review – almost Marvel-ous

								<p>From the moment it was announced, <strong>Vecna: Eve of Ruin</strong> looked like D&amp;D’s answer to Avengers: Endgame. As the old era of fifth edition closes, Dungeons and Dragons gathers its most famous faces for a multiversal battle with the greatest evil the IP has ever known. So far, so Marvel Cinematic Universe.</p>
<p>After a thorough review of the campaign book, I can confirm the parallels run even deeper. Like an Avengers movie, this <a href="https://www.wargamer.com/dnd/books">DnD book</a> is a bombastic popcorn fest of galactic proportions. And just like an Avengers movie, the <a href="https://www.wargamer.com/dnd/campaigns">DnD campaign</a>’s writing often feels shallow. Martin Scorsese
