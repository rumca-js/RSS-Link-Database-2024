While offering exceptional production values, including sharp visuals, there's enough strategic depth to satisfy long-standing fans of the series.\n\nThankfully, Homeworld 3 brings some new elements to the franchise, from cover mechanics and derelict structures that require their use to new tactics. While some mechanics, like the new ship abilities, can tend to overcomplicate encounters. Some additional polish is also welcome when it comes to unit pathfinding and specific bugs.\n\nNevertheless, if you're looking for a solid sci-fi RTS with a strong campaign and some interesting new modes like the rogue-like War Games, Homeworld 3 is worth a look.", "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gs2zlVv4w_E", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "source_obj__id": 129, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/Gs2zlVv4w_E/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Homeworld 3 Review - Was It Worth Waiting For 21 Years?", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-05-10T16:30:02+00:00", "description": "Art is subjective in nature, and video games being a form of art - their public reception can\u2019t always be unanimously positive or negative.
