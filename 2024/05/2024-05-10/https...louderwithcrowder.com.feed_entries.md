Donald Trump, as president, instituted common sense illegal immigration reforms. Joe Biden, on his first day as president, undid all of Trump's success with executive order. Democrats and the media (but I repeat myself) ignored the border crisis until it was important to Democrat-run cities. Now that the Biden Border Crisis is going to cost Biden reelection, something must be done!</p><p>CNN's Fareed Zakaria is calling for the most drastic action to be taken. He said Biden should bring back all of Trump's policies.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">CNN's Fareed Zakaria says that President Joe Biden needs to implement former President Donald Trump's asylum policies to deal with the illegal immigration crisis.<br /><br /

Outside of making sure my school and property taxes are paid (which is a rant for a different time), I can have whatever I want in my driveway. A man in Seaside, California got complaints that he had a boat in his driveway. Yes, SEAside. Boat. HIS boat. HIS driveway.</p><p>His response to the city about his boat, one might say, goes a little ... overboard.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
