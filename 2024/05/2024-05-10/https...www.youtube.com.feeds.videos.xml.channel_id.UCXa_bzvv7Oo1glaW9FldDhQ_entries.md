As the long-awaited mainline sequel in the sci-fi RTS series, Homeworld 3 is finally upon us. While offering exceptional production values, including sharp visuals, there's enough strategic depth to satisfy long-standing fans of the series.

Thankfully, Homeworld 3 brings some new elements to the franchise, from cover mechanics and derelict structures that require their use to new tactics. While some mechanics, like the new ship abilities, can tend to overcomplicate encounters. Some additional polish is also welcome when it comes to unit pathfinding and specific bugs.
