At the time of their visit to The Current, Middle Kids were touring the U.S. supporting Manchester Orchestra and Jimmy Eat World, giving Middle Kids a chance to play some amazing venues, including Red Rocks in Colorado. They also got to enjoy the comfy amenities of a proper tour bus ‚Ä¶ although they did experience one leak-related mishap that, were we to sensationalize it, could be construed as a case of yellow journalism (ahem).

Laamar has been a buzzed-about artist in the scene since performing at First Avenue this past January as part of the Best New Bands of 2023 showcase. And recently, Laamar returned with his band to their biggest stage yet, Palace Theater, to open for one of Minnesota‚Äôs most recognizable names in pop-rock music: Semisonic.

Just after recording an in-studio performance and interview at MPR, his soul-Americana, racial-justice song ‚ÄúSay My Name‚Äù hit no. 2 on The Current‚Äôs Chart Show.

Laamar (born Geoffrey Lamar Wilson) chatted with The Current about being raised by a musician father in North Minneapolis, to now taking on a similar role as a dad of two. Laamar also talked about finding confidence in singing, connecting with the local music scene and more. Watch the performance of "Say My Name" above.
