During a celebration of the best in Pacific Northwest tech, the community came together to pack the Showbox SoDo to network, eat and drink, pose for photos and cheer on the finalists and winners in a variety of categories.

The annual event, now in its 15th year, brought a sold-out crowd to Showbox SoDo in Seattle, where more than 60 finalists across a dozen categories competed for awards ranging from Startup of the Year to Next Tech Titan to Workplace of the Year, and more. Much like it has been for the past year, artificial intelligence was a recurring buzzword running through the evening,&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/geekwire-awards-2024-revealed-winners-bask-in-momentum-of-ai-and-potential-of-region/">Read More</a>

The news came out during an on-stage interview with Xbox president Sarah Bond at a Bloomberg event. According to Bond, the as-yet-unnamed store will launch in July on web browsers, rather than a designated app, with Microsoft’s recently-acquired Candy Crush Saga serving as a day-one tentpole franchise. Microsoft&#8217;s entry into the mobile gaming market — the most lucrative arm of the games industry — has been anticipated, particularly since the company&#8217;s recent $69 billion acquisition of California-based mega-developer Activision Blizzard King.

The Seattle City Council’s governance, accountability, and economic development committee approved a new ordinance, which will now move to a full council vote on May 28. Since the existing minimum pay law went into effect in January, tech giants including Uber and DoorDash responded by adding new fees for consumers, which caused demand to drop considerably. They also amped up lobbying efforts at City Hall, and their chief executive officers spoke against the law in response to questions from analysts&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/revised-minimum-wage-law-for-delivery-drivers-moves-forward-in-seattle-set-for-full-council-v
