I'll encourage library authors to annotate more code as `constexpr`, allowing CUDA C++ programmers to use the library directly (rather than writing their own), saving work and thus making friends.\n---\n\nVasu Agrawal\n\nVasu is a research engineer working at the intersection of graphics, machine learning, computer vision, and virtual reality (aka \"the Metaverse\"), focusing on high-performance, low-latency applications. In his free time, he enjoys watching movies & sci-fi TV shows, learning to play guitar (poorly), and practicing Tae Kwon Do.\n---\n\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com\nYouTube Channel Managed by Digital Medium Ltd: https://events.d", "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRQWxkRdPUI", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCMlGfpWw-RUdWX_JbLCukXg", "source_obj__id": 420, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/TRQWxkRdPUI/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Lightning Talk: Making Friends With CUDA Programmers (please constexpr all the things)  Vasu Agrawal", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
