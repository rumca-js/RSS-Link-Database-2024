## Question - Do the "Amiga Forever" Downloads Contain LEGAL Copies of the Games?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I recently got my hands on a few bits of old Amiga hardware, and I was looking into emulation. I came across the Amiga Forever package, being recommended as a legal source of Amiga OS images. However, I notice that all the bundles being sold include packs of games... but, weirdly, the Amiga Forever website seems vague about their rights to redistribute those games.</p> <p>Are the games included in the various &quot;Amiga Forever&quot; packages being distributed legally? The vagueness of &quot;games may change&quot; and their linking to sites with massive downloads makes it sound like they don't actually have the rights to the software they are distributing.</p> <p>(Perhaps a secondary question -- are buyers getting license rights to anything OTHER than the actual Amiga boot roms? Are the games included &quot;free downloads&quot; from other sources, as opposed to being legally licensed for sale?)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a hre

## Need help with Amiga 2000 and AT-BUS Clone 2008 card (Oktapus ROM)

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am helping my friend to rescue an old Amiga 2000 system. I know electronics a bit, and i am interested in old computers, but this is the first time i have my hands on any Amiga system, so know very little about Amiga universe, software and hardware specifics (a complete Amiga noob). </p> <p>To keep long story short, i have two cards in this system that i already know were by mistake inserted in wrong direction: BSC Memory Master 1.0, and AT-BUS 2008 Clone by Matze. These two cards were basically hanging the system, not allowing the Kickstart to run (there is 3.1 Kickstart ROM in it) . </p> <p>In case of Memory Master - i was able to find a bad 74LS245 bus transceiver IC, replaced it, and the card is alive again - i am able to start the system with this card inserted, it shows up in early board diagnostics, additional RAM is visible in Amiga Test Kit, and it passes all the tests. Great!</p> <p>Now the AT-BUS clone 2008 : it had exactly the same chip 

## Quick previewing IFF audio files on Mac OS - is it possible?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So, as the titled suggests, I was wondering if there was any neat software for a modern OS (specifically Mac) for quickly previewing Amiga IFF audio files. Much like you can preview mp3/wav/flac with just a press of the space bar.</p> <p>Would be really helpful for sorting and renaming the endless nameless IFF samples which I have on my Amiga, without having to individually open them in a tracker or audio editor on the machine itself.</p> <p>Feels like it could be a pretty simple plugin or program on MacOS. </p> <p>Cheers</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/glen_hodl"> /u/glen_hodl </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1d12ox6/quick_previewing_iff_audio_files_on_mac_os_is_it/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1d12ox6/quick_previewing_iff_audio_files_on_mac_os_is_it/">[comments]</a></span>
