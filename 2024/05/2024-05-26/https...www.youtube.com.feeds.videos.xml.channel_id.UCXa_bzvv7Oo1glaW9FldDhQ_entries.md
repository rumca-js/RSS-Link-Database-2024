Demand for an Assassin’s Creed game set in Japan has been high for as long as anyone can remember, but now that the series is finally going to feudal Japan, many will likely argue that they already got everything they wanted out of a Japan Assassin’s Creed game from 2020’s Ghost of Tsushima, and then some.

For Assassin’s Creed Shadows to have a shot at not being completely clowned by Ghost of Tsushima in those matchups, it’s going to have to excel in some particular areas, which is what we’ll be talking about here.
