It has 2 SSD drives connected to it (one for work, one for entertainment). I want to add an HDD drive to the pi to backup those drives in case anything happens to them. However, when I plug in the HDD into the pi, nothing happens. Then when I restart the pi, it doesn't actually boot up. I assume it's a power issue, so am now looking into getting a powered USB hub.</p> <p>The main reason I like the pi is because of the low idle power consumption (sub 5w). If I add a powered USB hub, what will the idle wattage be? Can I make it more efficient by powering down the HDD when it's not in use/backing up?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/storm4077\"> /u/storm4077 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1d0qlnv/powered_usb_hub_idle_wattage/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/com", "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1d0qlnv/powered_usb_hub_idle_wattage", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/.rss", "source_obj__id": 450, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Powered USB hub idle wattage?", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-05-26T01:21:56+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hello, I would like to know if there is anything to more actively search for a keyword in search indexers.</p> <p>Context: I opened my company in Brazil, and my data is public on the government website, and this is expected, but on the government website there is a CAPTCHA, But several websites use robots to take this information, and publish it on highly indexable pages, in order to receive visits and earn money from advertising.</p> <p>The problem is that these sites put together lists that criminals use, imagine instead of them having to know my ID, they just search for companys in city X, and get names, phone numbers and emails quickly.
