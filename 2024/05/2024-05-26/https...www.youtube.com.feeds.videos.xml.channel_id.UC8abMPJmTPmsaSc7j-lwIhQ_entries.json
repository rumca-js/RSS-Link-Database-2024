Two men, dressed in suits, stand facing each other with pistols drawn.  A tense pause ensues, heightening the anticipation. A gunshot rings out, one man falls to the ground, and the other casually walks away. The entire film lasts less than a minute, yet its impact lies in its starkness and the raw emotion it conveys through visual action alone.\n\nMusic: Schumann, Op.16", "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6qrr6Os2iA", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC8abMPJmTPmsaSc7j-lwIhQ", "source_obj__id": 241, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/U6qrr6Os2iA/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "(1896) A Pistol Duel.", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
