<p>Alexia Putellas returns to the big time, Chelsea get a taste of what Sonia Bompastor is about and Lyon struggle for numbers</p><p>Long live the queen. It took only three minutes after coming on, deep into injury time, for Alexia Putellas to seal <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/may/25/barcelona-lyon-womens-champions-league-final-match-report">Barcelona’s 2-0 victory against Lyon</a>. The 30‑year‑old has played a bit‑part role since her anterior cruciate ligament injury on the eve of the 2022 European Championship but her influence still runs through the club with an unmatched intensity. Putellas’s new contract is well deserved; the roar of the crowd when she stood on the sidelines ready to come on rivalled those for the goals. Barcelona with Putellas back at her best should strike fear through every European club with Champions League ambitions.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/may/26/five-talking-points-from-the-womens-champi

<p>All the creepy tropes come out of the closet when a mother and daughter battle unknown forces after the father bites the dust</p><p>This Karachi-set thriller joins the long list of movies that employ the language of horror to explore the oppressive stranglehold of the patriarchy. Unlike, say, Alex Garland’s <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jun/05/men-review-alex-garland-jessie-buckley-rory-kinnear">Men</a></em>, <em>In Flames</em> raids the box of generic horror tropes but fails to generate any notable scares. Instead, Pakistani-Canadian director Zarrar Kahn’s feature debut musters a vaguely brooding sense of unease and the suggestion that male eyes and unsavoury appetites are everywhere. Medical student Mariam (Ramesha Nawal) and her mother, Fariha (Bakhtawar Mazhar), find themselves in a precarious position when the family patriarch – Fariha’s father – dies. Debts are mounting and Mariam suspects that the offers of help from a creepy uncle (who might as well car

<p>The novelist takes us on a stroll to the Grand Bazaar, through Central Park and to Freeman’s on 72 Street for the best Reuben sandwiches</p><p><strong>Are Sundays special?</strong> No. I don’t have a nine to five, so I don’t live my life waiting for the weekends. I try to do a bit of writing first thing in a notepad, while my wife grabs a Sunday newspaper. Sometimes we sit in bed, sometimes in the sunroom with coffee.</p><p><strong>Sunday shopping?</strong> We’re in New York City. One of our favourite things is to go to the Grand Bazaar on 77th and Columbus. It’s half junk, half cool stuff. It’s like going on a museum trip – you never know what you’ll see.<br /><br /><strong>Any shopping mishaps?</strong> They literally sell anything: old containers of Tic Tacs, soaps you’d want to eat. My wife once bought a red leather coat with this shock of art on the back, and we’ve bought Persian carpets. And it all takes place in a school and they have food stands in the playground. Their dum
