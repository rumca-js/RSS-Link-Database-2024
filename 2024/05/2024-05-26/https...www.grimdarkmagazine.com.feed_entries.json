I thoroughly enjoyed Compton\u2019s debut novel, The Spite House, and waited in eager anticipation to see what this talented new voice in horror would deliver next. Devils Kill Devils opens on Sarita\u2019s wedding night. She senses a third party in the room, a pale figure enshrouded in shadows, who brutally murders her new husband, Frank, no questions asked. The murderer? Sarita\u2019s guardian angel, nicknamed Angelo: \u201cAngelo stood at the foot of the bed, dressed in black. Strands of his long, flaxen hair hung over his face. Through the thin curtain of hairs he met Frank\u2019s gaze with an ash-hot stare.\u201d While the underlying reason for Frank\u2019s murder is unclear, Angelo has saved Sarita\u2019s life on at least four previous occasions. Devils Kill Devils alternates between the present-day narrative and flashbacks that provide the history of Sarita\u2019s near-death encounters.
