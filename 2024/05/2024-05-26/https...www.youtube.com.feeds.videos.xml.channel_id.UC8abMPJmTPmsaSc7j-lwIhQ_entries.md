Filmed in Mexico, "A Pistol Duel" presents a simple yet dramatic scenario. Two men, dressed in suits, stand facing each other with pistols drawn.  A tense pause ensues, heightening the anticipation. A gunshot rings out, one man falls to the ground, and the other casually walks away. The entire film lasts less than a minute, yet its impact lies in its starkness and the raw emotion it conveys through visual action alone.

Music: Schumann, Op.16
