Good old Bluehost - one of the most popular shared hosting providers that is recommended by WordPress creators themselves.

Let's find out in my updated Bluehost review.

💰 Bluehost Plans and Pricing!

While bandwidth is still unmetered here, now you get only 10GB of SSD with your subscription, and there's no such thing as unlimited websites. However, there aren't a lot of shared hosting projects that would need 50GB of storage space either way. To be fair, Bluehost is still a cheap web hosting provider and balances value nicely.

There are three ways to get internet abroad – paying enormous mobile data roaming fees; getting a local sim with a heavily tourist-adjusted price… or grabbing an eSIM. And that’s what we’re talking about today. I’m here to do the very first Saily eSIM review.

🔎 What is an eSIM?

So, what is eSIM and when do you need eSIM in the first place? It’s a digital equivalent of a regular embedded SIM card, that you can use while traveling or working from abroad. And there are multiple benefits of eSIM over a regular SIM.  For example, eSIMs are usually cheaper. Especially if you compare them to data roaming charges. And you can learn about more benefits by watching the video!
