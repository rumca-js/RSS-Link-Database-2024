<p>iOS 18 may inject a little more fun into the iPhone experience. In the <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-05-26/apple-ios-18-macos-15-ai-features-project-greymatter-privacy-openai-deal-lwni63s3?cmpid=BBD052624_POWERON"><em>Power On</em></a> newsletter this week, <em>Bloomberg</em>’s Mark Gurman reports that AI-generated emoji will be among the new features Apple shows off at WWDC next month. As if the current emoji library weren’t overwhelming enough, Gurman writes that the company “is developing software that can create custom emojis on the fly, based on what users are texting.” I, for one, cannot wait to see the cursed creations that are sure to come out of that one.</p>
<p>Apple is also reportedly making it so iPhone users will have more customization options for their apps and home screen, like the ability to change the color of app icons and arrange things more freely, rather than being locked into the grid layout. The latter esp

<p>Ah, <em>Flappy Bird.</em> It’s been a long time since I last gave any thought to the game-turned-cultural-phenomenon that briefly had us all in a chokehold a decade ago. At least, that was the case until this morning, when I stumbled upon a <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlaydateConsole/comments/1czz3zc/flappybird_is_out_now_for_free/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><ins>Reddit</ins></a> post announcing a <em>Flappy Bird</em> tribute for the Playdate and, without a moment’s hesitation, sideloaded it onto my device. Now here I am, absolutely hooked on this maddening little game once again. And, using the crank to control that silly little bird, it's even harder this time around. <em>FlappyBird</em> by Chibisuke is free and available to download for Playdate on <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://chibisuke-games.itch.io/flappybird"><ins>itch.io</ins></a>. You’re welcome... or,
