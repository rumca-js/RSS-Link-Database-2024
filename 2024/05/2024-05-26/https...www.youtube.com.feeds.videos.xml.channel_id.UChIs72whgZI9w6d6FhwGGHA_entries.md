This news episode talks about Microsoft's new "Windows Recall" feature, which has significant privacy concerns -- but companies need to AI everything to boost profits. We'll also be covering AMD's entry-level Epyc server CPUs for AM5, Dell hinting at an NVIDIA processor for "AI PCs," KINGPIN resurfacing, and a 1000Hz display. Oh, and Noctua's extremely expensive lineup of "Home" products.
