Have you ever thought "Laptops sure are great, but I wish they had 3 monitors, desktop components, and weighed 20 times as much"? Good news! With the MaCase B43 chassis your PC can go from a portable, reasonably powered slate that lives in your backpack to a monstrously huge Frankenstein machine capable of running several instances of Crysis. This thing games so hard you'll totally forget about the disc you slipped in your back while trying to get it up onto the table.
