The chances are those celebrations will take place somewhere more exuberant or exotic after Adam Armstrong’s goal secured Southampton a return to the Premier League at the first attempt via a typically fraught Championship playoff final which totalled more than 102 minutes. For Leeds, it was more playoff final agony, this their fourth to end in tears. For Russell Martin, this was a beautiful ending to a fine season but for Daniel Farke, under whom he played at Norwich, it was an altogether different feeling.</p><p>It was a goal that embodied everything about Southampton’s style, the ultimate vindication for Martin’s methodical approach.

Instead, they’re the anonymous on-shift editor of the BBC News app, making snap judgments on whether to make the phones of millions of Britons buzz with a breaking news push alert.</p><p>The BBC does not publish user numbers, but external research suggests about 12.6 million Britons have its news app installed.

Elena is sensual and physically expressive, both professionally and in her many relationships. Dovydas, meanwhile, is asexual. But the fact that he doesn’t need or even want to have sex with Elena doesn’t mean he doesn’t want to be in a relationship with her.</p><p>It takes a bit of getting used to, but for a while it seems that love might conquer all, even the fundamental differences in their needs. Tensions between them are evocatively captured in this Lithuanian drama: an awkward, uneasy coupling between the pair is kept in a restrained mid shot, but the sequence that follows, showing Elena dancing with two colleagues, i

<p>How an Italian designer turned a tired one-bedroom art nouveau flat in north Italy into a modern but cosy home for her teenage family</p><p>Manuela Merlo’s house hunt finished almost as soon as it had begun. At her second house viewing, she found a 1920s ground-floor property in Turin that worked its magic. The one-bedroom art nouveau flat featured high ceilings and, at the back, an overgrown but fascinating garden. “When I first saw it the plants were covered with a blanket of snow and two cats were sleeping peacefully,” says Manuela. The tranquil scene was exactly what she was looking for. Located in the Crocetta district, the property is close to the city centre, but secluded enough not to be overwhelmed by the noise of nightlife activities. Manuela and her daughters Sveva, 16, and Costanza, 14, have now lived here for three years.</p><p>“When we bought the property in 2019, I had recently separated from my husband,” says Manuela. “I decided it was time for us to find a quiet pl

<p>This revealing memoir about the author’s 20 years in the City of Light identifies the complex codes of behaviour that newcomers are obliged to master</p><p>In 1990 the Spanish writer Juan Goytisolo published a short essay called Paris, Capital of the 21st Century. By the end of the 20th century, he had decided that Paris was exhausted. The city of avant gardes, ideas, revolutions and class struggle, which had defined so much of European and world history, was now no more than a museum. As almost a lifelong Parisian and a lover of the place, Goytisolo desperately wanted Paris in the 21st century to retake its place as a great metropolis. But this could only happen, he argued, if Paris reinvented itself by “de-Europeanising” itself. By this, he meant it had to look towards the world beyond Europe, welcoming its sometimes dissident non-French, non-European voices to make itself a truly global city. Only in this way could Paris be brought back to life.</p><p>More than 30 years on from

Three decades on, when it’s clear that nobody anywhere has been concerned enough, its message is still all too necessary and director Rhian Hutchings ensured it made its point, even if by no means a grand musical affair.</p><p>A prologue sees 1990s school children creating a tim

<p>From falling foul of Ray Charles to writing with Burt Bacharach and singing with Steely Dan, McDonald has led a fascinating, if addiction-fuelled, life, but his memoir errs on the side of cliche</p><p>Michael McDonald is possibly the greatest R&amp;B singer never to have made a great album of his own. You may know the voice from his work in the 1970s with the Doobie Brothers and Steely Dan, and from later hits such as I Keep Forgettin’, Yah Mo B There and On My Own. Even your kids may recognise him now from his guest spot on Thundercat’s 2017 single Show You the Way. McDonald also happens to be a brilliant pianist, a top bandleader and, on the evidence of this new memoir, a modest, easygoing, 24-carat Nice Guy. I only wish I could say, hand on heart, that he’s written a great book. Unfortunately its sluggish tempo and hackneyed style has you checking the number of pages to the end and reflecting, in echo of a famous line he once sang, “And I’ve got such a long way to go … ”</p><p>N

The club classic: “Aren’t you sorry you killed Christ?” was a regular. Because of my curly hair and olive skin they called me the N-word – a small child has to really yearn to use the N-word to say it to a predominantly Ashkenazi Jew. They also incorporated into their bullying the three moles I have on my right cheek. “See, that’s proof, these are the mark of the devil,” they said.

The three-day journey took her from St Petersburg, where she’d spent frozen months grappling with Russian grammar as part of her study year abroad, to the Ukrainian city of Kryvyi Rih, where a guitarist she’d fallen for had promised to take her on tour with his band, “Ukraine’s answer to the Red Hot Chili Peppers”. When the train finally crossed the border, it was fields of sunflowers that greeted her, “a glorious blur of yellow against the blue of the sky, like a firestorm”.</p><p>The trip becomes the fulcrum of this redolent, wryly honest memoir, in which she comes of age and chases love while striving for immersion in a region tha

<p><strong>Norwich Theatre Royal</strong><br />Brew revisits the car crash at the beginning of his ballet career that killed his three companions and left him paraplegic</p><p>Not quite dance, not quite theatre, <a href="https://norwichtheatre.org/whats-on/an-accident-a-life/">An Accident/A Life</a> is more like a multimedia, queasily hallucinatory staging of a story that puts the body of a dancer at its centre. That dancer is <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cw88344vwl0o">Marc Brew</a>, and the story revisits the traumatic turning point in his life when, at the beginning of his ballet career, the car he was in was hit by a drunk driver. All three of his companions died; Brew survived but was left paraplegic, aged 20. The story he tells is harrowing, touching, brutal and tender, but what makes this feel like a work of almost classical tragedy – you will absolutely experience fear, pity and catharsis – is its notably unclassical treatment of the staging, the body and its voic

<p>Die Werkself lost the Europa League final but ended season with two trophies and belief things will only get better</p><p>It wasn’t supposed to happen like this. They had shown they could fall with the finishing line in sight - and how - to Zinedine Zidane’s famous, thunderous left-footer at Hampden Park, or to a rampant Bayern Munich in the mid-Covid DFB Pokal final in Berlin. For a more modern twist you could even throw in last year’s Europa League semi-final under Xabi Alonso’s command, in which José Mourinho and Roma miraculously survived a barrage in the BayArena (23 Leverkusen shots to Roma’s one). Not this season, though.</p><p>The greatest testament to Bayer Leverkusen’s extraordinary season is that losing Wednesday’s Europa League final in Dublin (and comprehensively at that) to Atalanta felt like the shock, rather than <em>Die Werkself</em> getting there in the first place to fluff their lines.

An hour to two of gentle cooking without the ticking clock of making dinner. An afternoon in which I put together savoury biscuits as fragile as frost on a windowpane, and rolls of filo pastry so thin you could see their contents of asparagus and feta hiding within. This is cooking just for the joy of it.</p><p>The biscuits are mostly cheese and butter, held together with a little flour and egg, their filling lightly beaten cream cheese and soft-leaved herbs. They can carry a little warmth, too, in the form of ground Aleppo pepper or, should you prefer, smoked paprika. If you don’t want to sandwich them, custard-cream style, then the biscuits are good on their own, served with drinks.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/article/2024/may/26/nigel-slaters-recipes-for-asparagus-and-feta-rolls-and-cream-cheese-and-herb-biscuits">

<p><strong>Sadler’s Wells, London</strong><br />The French choreographer’s 1981 interpretation of the playwright’s world rewards patience with its magic and precision</p><p>A silent dance based on the writings of Samuel Beckett doesn’t exactly set the heart racing. Cue gloom and despair, without even Beckett’s words to enliven it. And when the 10 dancers of the French <a href="https://compagnie-maguy-marin.fr/">Compagnie Maguy Marin</a> are revealed in crepuscular darkness, clothes white, faces plastered in white clay, feet dragging across a chalk-covered floor, I feared the worst.</p><p>But <em><a href="https://www.sadlerswells.com/freesheet-compagnie-maguy-marin-may-b/">May B</a></em> is a magical piece, both tribute and elaboration. Marin, now 72, made it in 1981, when Beckett was still alive. That early section, all shuffling, grunting and dry humping, sets the absurdist tone as the dancers move in a precisely modulated group, occasionally delivering a line from <em>Endgame</em> (

<p>We all start our journey into motherhood with a Plan A for the birth, but wouldn’t it be helpful if we had a Plan B or C or even D?</p><p>Oh God, I mean, I laugh about it now. Which is funny in itself really, the idea that 10 years later I’d be laughing about the day, the dawn, where, white-faced in a room with blood up the walls, I would hand our new raw blinking baby to my boyfriend in order to frantically find, in my Notes app, the document I had grandly named Birth Plan. What was I hoping to find there, I wonder now. It’s funny, it <em>is</em> funny, how I scoured it – “I want a mobile epidural”, “I want gentle guidance rather as opposed to being forced to push” – this plan, written as if ticking off boxes on a dim sum menu, written in the voice of the person I was before. It seemed crucial, in that moment, to see if perhaps I’d given them the wrong piece of paper. Had it been an admin error?

Paul Weller reveals how he beat his demons, found a new sound – and why he’s still angry with the establishment</p><p>In a roof garden, high above central London, stands Paul Weller, reed-slim in a pale mac, black trousers and shades. Silver hair slicked back, slight smile, lord of all he surveys. He looks so cool, it’s almost funny. Why hasn’t he put on weight? Why hasn’t he lost his hair? How come he can wear those sunglasses and not look like he’s trying too hard? Because he’s Paul Weller, that’s why. Being cool is one of Weller’s USPs, and it has been ever since the Jam’s first <em>Top of the Pops</em> appearance, in 1977, for In The City. He, Bruce Foxton and Rick Waller all wore the same outfit: white shirt, skinny tie, buttoned-up black jacket, black trousers. But Weller’s haircut was better, his jacket tighter, he wore it all more convincingly. He’s had so many style iterations over the years. There are

But in the mid-1980s, things seemed at last to shift. Suddenly, the atmosphere was heady. “There was an energy and excitement that I can’t even begin to describe,” says Chitra Karve, who in 1986 had just taken up a full-time job at the Anti-Apartheid Movement in London. “I worked an inordinate number of hours, but I never thought about that.

That’s a four-word phrase guaranteed to strike fear into the heart of, well, me. What in God’s name is going to happen in this sharp-edged restaurant in Cheltenham, where life is meant to be as unchallenging as an episode of <em>Countryfile</em>? Am I going to have to lick a black pudding espuma from a plaster cast of the chef’s lips? Will each dish be spoon fed to me while I’m forced to wear headphones and listen to a soundtrack of Jacob Collier telling me which key I’m masticating in

Don’t be in a hurry and keep taking small steps</p><p><em><strong>The question</strong></em> <em>I have a husband and a toddler I adore, and I have the dream job. </em><em>But although the job is a dream on paper, I am finding myself unhappy in it. Now that I have the perfect career, after finally completing my PhD, having delayed it for maternity, it is somehow disappointing. I am seeing a therapist, but we are early on, and I want the happiness to come faster. The problem as I see it is that what I really want to do is creative writing; I want to write novels. This is very different from all my scientific and maths education, so I am not very qualified for it. I am fearful of failure and of my writing being poor. It seems impossible that I could ever be successful. It also feels impossible to fit it in around my child and life and work. But I also know </em><em>I will never write a book i

<p>Why the Italian region’s luscious red, white and rosé wines are having a major moment</p><p><strong>Paolo Leo Passitivo Primitivo Organic Appassimento, Puglia, 2022 (from £12.80, <a href="https://ndjohn.co.uk/products/paolo-leo-organic-passitivo-primitivo-75cl">ND John</a>) </strong>Wines from Puglia seem to be a word-of-mouth hit at the moment. So many friends and family have mentioned the region in Southern Italy’s heel as their best recent vinous discovery – and wine merchants say they’re selling better than any other Italian wine. There’s an obvious explanation: Puglian reds offer rather a lot of rich, concentrated fruit for the money, with a natural sweetness (many have a level of sugar that takes them into off-dry territory) offset by a classic Italian tomato-or-plum-like tartness that makes them extremely good with tomato-based sauces and hard cheese – or a combination of the two on a pizza. Many of the most popular Puglians are made with the appassimento technique, with som

<p>The Observer turned quizmaster to find out who knew what</p><p>‘How bright are the British?’ the <em>Observer</em> asked on 17 September 1989, turning quizmaster to ask the nation a set of ‘easy’ general knowledge questions, then reporting back on the results, sliced and diced for demographics.</p><p>The questions spanned basic arithmetic, culture, geography, history and more. Although none would trouble a <em>University Challenge</em> team, seven of the 2,275 adults who took part got all of them wrong. Only 30 managed a perfect 100%. Scotland was the worst-performing region. North London beat south London and the Greens did better than voters for other parties. Private and state school classes of 12-year-olds pitted against each other resulted in a ‘narrow win’ for private. Women fared worse than men (several prominent female academics declined to take the test), possibly because: ‘They are too busy holding down a job, mothering, wifeing and doing the housework to acquire general

<p>The unequal distribution of resources needs to be addressed at government level</p><p>It is commendable of the <em>Observer</em> to highlight the crisis of child poverty, but the government – and prospective governments – should prioritise tackling <em>the</em> poverty crisis (“<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/article/2024/may/18/child-poverty-uk-scandal-britain-charities-families">Britain 2024: The scandal of child&nbsp;poverty</a>”, Focus and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/may/18/the-observer-view-on-child-poverty-labour-must-tackle-this-scourge-as-soon-as-possible">Editorial</a>).</p><p>Unfortunately, Rishi Sunak did not address poverty at all when he mapped out his five “priorities” in January 2023, nor did our PM-in-waiting, Keir Starmer, feel that the issue of poverty was important enough for Labour’s six “first steps”. It appears that it requires a former prime minister – Gordon Brown – to become the driving force for ending child
