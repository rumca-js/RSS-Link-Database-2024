Sorry for the fairly short VR Corner this week but I'm actually on holiday right now and this, combined with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eurogamer-has-a-new-parent-company" target="_blank">recent Eurogamer news</a>, meant that I didn't have much time to do a fully fleshed-out VR Corner for you.</p><p>I couldn't bear to leave you without the usual Sunday shenanigans though, so I did manage to squeeze in a quick look at Senua's Saga: Hellblade II running in VR, thanks to Praydog's amazing UEVR mod. It's a shorter Corner than usual and there's a bit at the end that wouldn't be there if I'd had the time to go back and work out a fix for the error, so please accept my apologies for the scruffiness of this one!</p><p>The game itself is a bit of a graphical powerhouse on PC anyway, so running it in VR is going to be a test

It's also provided the world with one of the most iconic characters in science fiction: John-117, aka the Master Chief. To many people, the Chief is Halo. But what happens when you leave him out?
