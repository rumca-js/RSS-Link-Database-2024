Caesar is dead, long live Caesar. IGN sat down with the cast & director of Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes for a wide-ranging interview about their experiencing writing a new chapter in the Planet of the Apes franchise. Stars Owen Teague, Freya Allan, Kevin Durand, and Peter Macon discuss the challenges of staying rooted in their characters while also having to believably act like apes - or in Allan’s case, being the only human onscreen for most of Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes’ runtime.

May the 4th be with you... always. 

In honor of Star Wars Day, we've compiled every single flip from the original trilogy and prequel trilogy. From Sith apprentice, Darth Maul's fancy flips with his double-bladed lightsaber to Luke Skywalker's heroic flip over the Sarlacc in Tatooine, and even that one random Jedi Knight getting blasted by those sonic blobs on Geonosis-- there's no shortage of force-fueled flips across the Star Wars timeline. 

How many times do people flip in the Star Wars movies? The answer may surprise you.
