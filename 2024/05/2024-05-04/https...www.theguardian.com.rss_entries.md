<p>Britain has turned out in force to vote for change. Whenever the Tories go to the country, we will be ready to provide it</p><p>Rishi Sunak might have been too scared to put his name on the ballot this week, but voters sent him a clear message in the local elections anyway. Across the country, people turned out to vote for change – from the manufacturing heartlands of Derby to industrial Redditch and Thurrock in Essex. In Aldershot, home of the British army, Labour won Rushmoor borough council, ending 24 years of Tory rule. Ten more police and crime commissioners – which, as a former chief prosecutor, makes me incredibly proud. And in York and North Yorkshire, the first Labour mayor, in the prime minister’s back garden.</p><p>Victories in traditional Tory territory across the country are important to me.

<p>Artist <a href="https://www.selenakearney.com/">Selena Kearney</a> was raised on the Chehalis reservation in Washington state and began photographing fake native regalia after a chance encounter with a young woman in a grocery store on Halloween. “She was wearing a skimpy faux-Native American costume,” she says. “I couldn’t begin to understand how that cheap outfit had anything to do with me, or my heritage.” Curious about the power of these objects, she started to collect and consider them, sourcing sports paraphernalia, traditional headdresses and vintage and new costumes from eBay and Amazon. Over the course of five years, Kearney photographed them and the resulting series is now featured in a book, <a href="https://minormattersbooks.com/products/every-object-has-a-ritual-by-selena-kearney?variant=42110115938469">Every Object Has a Ritual (published by Minor Matters)</a>, and an exhibition at the <a href="https://suquamish.nsn.us/suquamish_museum/">Suquamish Museum in Washington

<p>Inscrutable bureaucracy and monstrous insects may not sound immediately appealing, but once you’re lost in Kafka’s world you won’t want to escape</p><p>Kafka has become such a cultural icon that even the most private, obscure, or fragmentary of his writings have reached huge audiences: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/may/01/what-we-learn-about-kafka-from-his-uncensored-diaries">diaries</a>, letters, unpublished notes, mystifying aphorisms, or conversation slips he made while dying. Because so much of his work is available to readers (even a selection of documents from his day job at the Workers’ Accident Insurance Institute has been translated into English), it can be daunting to know where to begin if you want to try his work for the first time.

<p>The theatre adaptation of Studio Ghibli’s beloved animation sold out in Japan in four minutes. As it comes to the UK, we meet the international team of creatives bringing its giant dragons and tiny soot sprites to life</p><p>The dragon stirs to life as Toby Olié plucks it up by its tail. He spirals it&nbsp;through the air and, quick as ripping off a plaster, tears the creature in two. “Even when he&nbsp;was curled up on the floor,” the puppet designer says, undoing another of the dragon’s joints, “he took up too much space.” Olié sticks the body back together, a little shorter but more malleable now, and the tail wriggles back into being.</p><p>Best known for his work on War Horse, Olié is holding a miniature prototype for Haku, a boy who transforms into an enormous serpentine dragon. Haku is one of the leading characters in Hayao Miyazaki’s exquisite animation Spirited Away, which has been adapted into a major stage production.

<p>I love intercourse – so why has it been so long since I actually had any?</p><p>I first had sex when I was 16; I have since had quite a few people inside my body. Some were more welcome than others – like the surgeon who removed my inflamed appendix, and that incredibly hot Dutch photographer in a Utrecht Airbnb, to whom I would have <em>given </em>my appendix, had he asked. Others have only penetrated me with their words or in my fantasies. Some of the experiences feel unreal, like the guy who referred to himself as “Big Mike” and claimed that he was moving to Finland the next day, despite there being no packed moving boxes or suitcases in his house. I&nbsp;wouldn’t be able to pick him out of a lineup today.</p><p>I am torn between two different versions of that story. In one, I was twentysomething, wild, confident and single.

<p>As the war stretches on indefinitely, there are few eager recruits and Kyiv’s armed forces are short of soldiers</p><p>Anton* was on his way to work as a civilian volunteer in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv 10 days ago. Several men stopped him. They asked: “Hi, who are you?” And: “Can you show me your documents please?” One of the officers produced a tablet and scrolled down a list. He found Anton’s name. A single word was written next to it in red capital letters: <em>ukhyliant</em>, or draft dodger. The men took him to the nearest conscription office.</p><p>That morning, Anton and his colleague Serhii were due to drive a truck full of humanitarian aid to a frontline zone. The two men – aged 32 and 31 – had been checked twice before, once outside a metro station, and on a second occasion while waiting for a tram. They received pieces of paper. The first was a polite request to register details. The second an official summons to report to a recruiting centre as soon as possible.</p>

Her fridge dinner salad, for example, turns tired vegetables into a luscious and exotic pink salad by serving them with a tart rhubarb dressing. In today’s take on the original, I’ve added legumes to make it more substantial and upped the umami factor by putting some optional white miso in the dressing.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/may/04/how-to-make-a-fridge-raid-salad-recipe-zero-waste-cooking-tom-hunt">Continue reading...</a>

I was thinking about this quote as I laced my Gore-Tex boots and pulled on my hat for another day of lambing outdoors.</p><p>There are three bits of equipment that I need with me each day at lambing time – my lip balm, lambing rope (a very thin, silky rope that can be washed after each use) and a New Zealand super crook.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/may/04/country-diary-lambing-would-be-almost-impossible-without-this-super-crook">Continue reading...</a>
