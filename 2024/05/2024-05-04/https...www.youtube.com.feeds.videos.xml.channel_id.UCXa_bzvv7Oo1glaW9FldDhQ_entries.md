Nearly a decade after its initial release, Rare's Sea of Thieves is in a worthwhile place, but that's nothing new for its longtime fans. It's long been a worthwhile live service adventure that encapsulates the experience of being a pirate, from sailing the high seas and digging for treasure on unknown islands to fighting skeletons and other horrors.

With its PS5 version, PlayStation fans can finally experience everything fans on other platforms have been raving about. The gorgeous environments and beautifully detailed waves. The quirky characters and carefree atmosphere. The narrative range of its Tall Tales and much more.

There are some areas where Sea of Thieves could still improve, whether it's adding more to its combat or providing a proper character creator. Nevertheless, it's the perfect time to jump in and embrace the pirate's life.

It looks like yet another grand adventure brimming with new locales to explore, fierce enemies to fight, and weapons to collect. But the bigger question that we are trying to answer with this feature is whether the expansion will be able to catch the same magic as the base game or if it will end up being an underwhelming conclusion to the story of Elden Ring.
