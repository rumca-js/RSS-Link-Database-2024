We still have the $1,000,000 Computer, a cluster of over a petabyte of NVMe storage that can run at speeds in excess of 100GB/s! The problem is, it draws a RIDICULOUS amount of power, and subsequently generates a RIDICULOUS amount of heat… so much that its overwhelming the AC in our server room. Today we fix that… at least we hope.
