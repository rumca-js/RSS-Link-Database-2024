  <p id="Dba1pA">When we last left <em>The Boys</em>, Homelander’s (Anthony Starr) political dabbling was humming along and Billy Butcher (Karl Urban) had a terminal illness. Two years and a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23924179/gen-v-the-boys-season-2-renewal">new spin-off</a> later, Homelander’s supercharging of a presidential campaign continues to be a dark mirror of the US political climate and Butcher looks to desperately reckon with his diagnosis.</p>

  <p id="2jeQGe">Getting into cycling in my late thirties has been humbling. </p>
<p id="n0N3xu">I’m responsible for my own medical costs, which really makes me consider things differently than when I was a kid tearing through the neighborhood park on a twelve-speed Huffy. I’ve also discovered you can spend infinite money on bike stuff if you have the resources, which I do not.</p>
<p id="y0F4wc">Most of all, I’ve learned that knowing how to get from point A to point B in a car or on a bus does <em>not</em> mean you know the best way to get there on a bike. For this particular bit of cycling logistics, I’ve found a tremendous — and mercifull

  <p id="Th804H">Social media’s algorithms know that I ride a bike almost every day. My quiver includes a city bike, mountain bike, and gravel bike, in addition to one or two e-bikes I’m always in the process of reviewing. I’m also the family mechanic, which makes me responsible for no less than 16 to 18 tires that I must keep inflated.
