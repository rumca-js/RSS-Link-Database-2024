But Northampton, having looked completely lost in front of 82,000 at Croke Park, burst into life in the final quarter to give Leinster something of a scare.</p><p>The home side, though, are too packed to the rafters with international quality to lose from such a position. They have had their wobbles in the recent past, but letting slip a 20-3 lead early in the first half would really have been too painful to contemplate.

<p>The author of bestseller Yellowface on her agent’s fears about publishing the novel, the joys of a social media purge and being a workaholic who gets bored easily</p><p>Rebecca F Kuang, 27, is an American writer. She and her family emigrated to the US from Guangzhou, China, when she was four; she grew up in Dallas, Texas. Her first novel, <em>The Poppy War</em>, a grimdark fantasy with a plot drawn from elements of the second Sino-Japanese war, was published in 2018. Two sequels followed. A fourth novel, the bestselling <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/sep/10/babel-by-rf-kuang-review-an-ingenious-fantasy-about-empire">Babel</a></em>, set in 1830s England, came out in 2022. Kuang followed this with a controversial departure: <em>Yellowface</em>. A contemporary melodrama in which a white author steals the manuscript of a dead, far more successful Asian-American novelist and passes it off as her own, it wickedly satirises identity politics in the world of publishing

<p>The ninth and final series of the ever-inventive black comedy is packed with stars and cements its status as a classic. It’s such a shock America hasn’t tried to copy it yet</p><p>Oh, so weird. I&nbsp;thought they were meant to be more careful with these. Anyway I’ve been given a leaked script from the new – and final – series of Inside No 9 (8 May, 10pm, BBC Two), so I suppose it is my duty as a journalist to publicly leak it. Shame to spoil the series but that is part of the job. I take no pleasure in reporting this.</p><p>STEVE PEMBERTON DRESSED AS A WOMAN: Ooh, are we doing a growing sense of horror in this one or a ludicrous farce? <em>Oooooh</em>!</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/article/2024/may/04/inside-no-9-dark-funny-and-endlessly-riveting">Continue reading...</a>

<p>I get advice about my age on social media (not all of it friendly), but I’m sanguine about life without youthful anxieties</p><p>How old is old? That depends on how old you are, for as you age you will nudge that number upwards. A recent German study asked people over the age of 40 that same question eight times over a period of 25 years, and it found <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2024/apr/22/when-old-age-starts-perception-study">“old” gets older as we age</a>.

<p>For two years, a viral joke mocking the singer’s dancing threatened to overshadow her record-breaking success – but the laser-focused star had the last laugh. And now she has her sights set on building a media empire</p><p>The London hotel room is huge, with a grand piano in one corner. In the middle is a stash of crisps, nuts and drinks, laid out as if we were in a high-end store. And on a sofa I can just about make out Dua Lipa, lost in the vastness. She could be a top footballer – red hair tied back, fresh-faced, wearing black tracksuit bottoms and a striped top. I’m trying to think what club it is. Barcelona?</p><p>She laughs. “No, I designed it. It’s merch.” I look closely. On the front, it says Training Season – the title of the second single from her forthcoming album, Radical Optimism. Ah, that makes sense; she is playing for FC Dua Lipa. Over the next hour, Lipa makes it clear that she’s a devoted fan of FC Dua Lipa, gives her all to it, and can only see it growing exponen

<p>For 30 years, Brian McNeill hunted the world’s second-biggest fish from small boats off the wild west coast of Ireland. Now the species has made a recovery so rapid it has astounded scientists</p><p>The ambush was simple. A spotter on a hill would scan the sea and when he saw the big black fins approach, he would shout down to the boatmen. They would ready their nets and quickly row out to the kill zone.</p><p>When a shark got tangled in the mesh, Brian McNeill would wait a minute or two while it struggled, then steady himself and raise his harpoon. This was the crucial moment. The creature would be diving and thrashing, desperate to escape. If the blade hit the gills blood would spurt, clouding the water. The trick was to hit a small spot between the vertebrae.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/may/04/ireland-achill-mayo-last-basking-shark-hunter-return-of-giant-fish">Continue reading...</a>
