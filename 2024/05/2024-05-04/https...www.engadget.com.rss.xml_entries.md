<p>Threads is giving users more control over who can quote their posts (as in, reposting with commentary). If you don‚Äôt want just anyone to be able to quote your posts, you now have the option to allow only people you follow to do so. Or, you can make it so no one can quote your posts at all. Head of Instagram <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.threads.net/@mosseri/post/C6hmM-DvK_R"><ins>Adam Mosseri</ins></a> announced the update this weekend, saying he hopes it will ‚Äúhelp keep Threads a more positive place.‚Äù The platform tested the feature among a group of Threads users last month, but it‚Äôs now rolling out to everyone.</p>

<p>Parrots are innately social creatures. In captivity, where they typically don‚Äôt have a flock to interact with, that can present some real challenges for keeping them happy and healthy. But recent research suggests technology may be able to help them meet more of their social needs. A <a href="https://ilyena.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/hirskyjdouglas_parrotvideocalls.pdf"><ins>new (very small) study</ins></a> led by researchers at the <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/news/headline_1069444_en.html">University of Glasgow</a> and Northeastern University compared parrots‚Äô responses when given the option to video chat with other birds via Meta's Messenger versus watching pre-recorded videos. And it seems they‚Äôve got a preference for real-time conversations.</p>
<p>The research builds on findings from a series of small studies over the last few years, including one in which the team trained pet parrots to make video calls to each other (with human assistan
