In news that should be of no surprise to anyone given Fortnite's all-consuming nature, post-apocalyptic RPG series Fallout will soon be making an appearance in the battle royale game.
</p><p>
Fallout is, of course, currently enjoying a bit of a renaissance thanks to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-fallout-tv-show-was-watched-by-65m-people-in-its-first-two-weeks">Amazon's recent live-action TV adaptation</a>, making it a prime target for the popularity vampire that is Fortnite.
</p><p>
Fortnite's impending Fallout collaboration was teased on its <a href="https://x.com/FortniteGame/status/1791499072789979575">official X account</a>, where a winky face and thumbs-up emoji (squint a bit and it could be Vault Boy) accompanied an image of someone in T-60 power armour staring pensively out of frame amid clouds of belching smoke.

Endless Legend, the superb fantasy 4X game from developer Amplitude Studios, is currently free to download and keep on Steam - and there's still almost a week to claim it.
</p><p>
Amplitude - which has also developed the likes of Endless Space, Dungeons of the Endless, and Humankind - released Endless Legend back in 2014. It quickly drew praise for its fantasy flavoured Civ-style strategy - enlivened by some smart twists on the formula and its highly distinctive factions - mixed with a heavy dollop of lore.
</p><p>
If you're still a stranger to Endless Legend's action some ten years after its release, and the above description has set your strategy nubbin a-tingling, you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/289130/ENDLESS_Legend/">permanently add it to your Steam library</a> for the princely sum of zero money right now.

A final update is on its way to Redfall after all.
</p><p>
Following the news <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-shuts-slew-of-bethesda-studios-including-redfall-hi-fi-rush-developers">Microsoft was closing a number of Bethesda studios</a> including Redfall developer Arkane Austin, it was reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/redfall-studio-was-reportedly-working-on-offline-mode-for-may-release-before-closure">the team was working on DLC and updates</a> - including an offline mode - until very recently.

</p><p>
A new post on X, however, states the update is still on the way. "Thank you all for your supportive messages," it reads. "We are working to release our final update, Game Update 4, that brings revamped Neighbourhood and Nest systems, Single Player Pausing, Offline Mode, and more. We'll provide additional details soon

Microsoft plans to launch this year's Call of Duty via Xbox Game Pass for the first time, in a first for the franchise. 
</p><p>
That's according to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/microsoft-call-of-duty-game-pass-53e8930c">The Wall St Journal</a>, which today reported that Microsoft had now made the decision ahead of the game's formal unveiling next month.
</p><p>
While Xbox has always brought new first-party games to Xbox Game Pass on day one, and Activision Blizzard is now a Microsoft first-party publisher following the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-has-finally-bought-activision-blizzard">completion of its $68.7bn takeover</a>, there had still been a question mark over whether Call of Duty would be included.

## Fortnite's latest live event kicks off countdown to Mad Max-esque new season

Fortnite players were last night treated to a mini live event, as the battle royale capped off its current Greek god season, and set up a grittier, heavy metal-infused new season to come. 
</p><p>
The event seemed to show a moment of revenge from the now-felled Greek god Zeus, as his statue charged up the map's enormous Pandora's Box and unleashed a new threat to the Island.
</p><p>
The action began at 7pm UK time when, for the third day running, Zeus' giant statue atop Mount Olympus began glowing with light. In-game combat was temporarily paused as the statue raised its sword aloft and red lightning shot upwards - and then came crashing down onto Pandora's Box.

Microsoft is adding the ability to pre-download game updates before their scheduled release. 
</p><p>
The feature, which is already available on PlayStation, allows you to download hefty game updates days before their release. Then, when the update is formally released, the update simply installs - meaning less wait time to get playing. 
</p><p>
Microsoft has <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/hardware-network/xbox-insider-release-notes/console/alpha/2024/05/alpha-2406-240509-2000">begun</a> rolling out the feature to those in the Alpha ring of Xbox Insider testers, before it filters down to more people and eventually becomes public in the coming weeks.

Creative Assembly is reportedly working on three new Total War games, including an officially licensed Star Wars game.
</p><p>
The news comes from <a href="https://www.dualshockers.com/total-war-star-wars-reportedly-in-works-at-creative-assembly/">DualShockers</a>, which has reported as of October 2023 Total War: Star Wars was one of three games in development at the studio.
</p><p>
The studio's most recent game was Total War: Pharaoh, but a Star Wars game would see it return to the more fantastical settings of Total War: Warhammer and (to an extent) Total War: Three Kingdoms.

The studio shared the news in a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7196925181712343042/">LinkedIn post</a>, stating that after a "long period of evaluating how to navigate our economic environment, we have had to significantly restructure the company to pave a path for a strong future."
</p><p>
The statement does not specify how many staff are affected by layoffs, but principal engineer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7196912654806835200/">Kris Morness</a> posted "about 140" people have been impacted.

Valve's next game is an Overwatch-style third-person hero shooter named Deadlock, a new report has stated.
</p><p>
Details have emerged from an ongoing closed alpha playtest of the game, which veteran Valve reporter <a href="https://youtu.be/k8MqhEz6N_k?si=JRygt_D_zyAiMkwq">Tyler McVicker</a> said currently has "hundreds" of people playing, ahead of an imminent public announcement for the project. 
</p><p>
Competitive gaming YouTubers have also now been invited to try the build - and perhaps inevitably, it looks like someone has decided to break their NDA.

Rockstar's GTA 5 has now sold over 200m copies.
</p><p>
This news, said Take Two CEO Strauss Zelnick, exceeded the company's forecast. By its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-5-closes-in-on-200m-copies-sold">previous financial report, GTA 5 had sold 195m copies</a> - so that's another 5m copies since February.

</p><p>
"We are thrilled that more than a decade after their initial releases, Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online grew their audience size by an incredible 35 percent and 23 percent, respectively, for the full year," said Zelnick.
