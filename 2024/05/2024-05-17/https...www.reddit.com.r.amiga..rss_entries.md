<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I currently have a A1200, running through to a HDMI Converter to a Monitor. So is there any way to get it to display better / more full screen? Most games run in a small, off centre window, but some Demos etc can stretch to nearly full screen. Any way to get the games running at this resolution and not in a small window?</p> <p>Cheers</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Salt-Machine-4028"> /u/Salt-Machine-4028 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1cu37c8/amiga_display/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1cu37c8/amiga_display/">[comments]</a></span>
