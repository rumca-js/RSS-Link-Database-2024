<p>For those looking to elevate their cooking, a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/smart-sous-vide-guide-151821790.html">sous vide machine</a> might be the perfect addition to your toolkit. Previously, these gadgets were almost exclusively used by high-end restaurants. But more recently, prices have come down to where they can be relatively affordable additions to your kitchen. These devices make preparing perfectly cooked steaks a breeze while taking all the guesswork and hassle out of dishes like pulled pork or brisket. And it’s not just for meat either, as a sous vide machine can make easy work out of soft-boiled eggs, homemade yogurt or fish. And while some may say you need a lot of accessories like vacuum sealers or special bags to get the best results, starting with the right appliance will get you 90 percent of the way. So to help you figure out which sous vide machine is right for you, we’ve assembled a list of our favorite gadgets on sale right now.</p>

<p>According to a pair of content creators, the wait for a new Valve game is almost over: A third-person hero shooter called <em>Deadlock </em>is in closed alpha and an announcement seems imminent.</p>
<p>The game has apparently been in the works since 2018, with IceFrog, a developer synonymous with the original <em>DotA</em> mod, in charge. It’s reportedly what became of the <em>Neon</em> <em>Prime</em> project that <a href="https://twitter.com/Tyler_McV/status/1585248006982762496">has been rumored</a> for a couple of years. Tyler McVicker, a veteran Valve reporter, and the content creator Gabe Follower, have this week both independently confirmed the game is in an advanced state of development.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“In terms of scope,” McVicker says, “this is meant to be Valve's next major competitive game. The next Counter-Strike. The next Dot

<p>In the summer of 2023, OpenAI created a “Superalignment” team whose goal was to steer and control future AI systems that could be so powerful they could lead to human extinction. Less than a year later, that team is dead.</p>
<p>OpenAI <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-17/openai-dissolves-key-safety-team-after-chief-scientist-ilya-sutskever-s-exit?srnd=technology-vp&amp;sref=10lNAhZ9"><ins>told</ins></a> <em>Bloomberg</em> that the company was “integrating the group more deeply across its research efforts to help the company achieve its safety goals.” But a series of tweets from Jan Leike, one of the team’s leaders who recently quit revealed internal tensions between the safety team and the larger company.</p>

<p>Slack trains machine-learning models on user messages, files and other content without explicit permission. The training is opt-out, meaning your private data will be leeched by default. Making matters worse, you’ll have to ask your organization’s Slack admin (human resources, IT, etc.) to email the company to ask it to stop. (You can’t do it yourself.)

## How to shop for a smart grill

<p>Smart grills are expensive. Companies definitely make you pay a premium for the conveniences that a little Wi-Fi can afford. When it comes to pellet grills, you’re likely going to pay over $1,000. Ditto for gas models that have wireless connectivity. For this reason, it’s important to consider what types of cooking you plan to do and how often you plan to do it when you’re shopping. Do you cook burgers for warm-weather holidays or sear the occasional steak? Dropping that much money might be overkill. But if you prefer to cook outdoors nearly year-round and are ready to expand your culinary skills to include low-and-slow smoking, you’re in the right place.</p>
<p>The real benefit of a smart grill is being able to keep tabs on your food without having to stand next to it the whole time. Most models allow you to monitor temperatures and offer some degree of cooking guidance. There’s convenience for beginners and experienced cooks alike, especially for things that take several hours to

<p>One of the biggest, most iconic gaming series is almost back. <em>Grand Theft Auto 6 </em>is apparently <a href="https://www.engadget.com/grand-theft-auto-6-will-arrive-in-fall-2025-205513138.html">on track for a fall launch next year</a> — a little more specific than the previous release window of “2025.”</p>
<p>There’s no new trailer, and GTA publisher, Take-Two, is not quite ready to offer a specific release date. CEO Strauss Zelnick told <em>Variety</em>: “I think we’re going to leave it there for now.”</p>
<p>The sixth mainline installment will be set in Leonida (Rockstar’s Florida equivalent) and focused mostly on Vice City (Miami). Compared to <em>GTA Vice City</em>, however, it’ll be contemporary. So, I’m banking on OnlyFans pastiches, vapes, self-driving cars and everything else 2020s. Plus explosions and crime.</p>

<p>PC gamers have almost too many options when it comes to titles to play, which is a great problem to have. With decades of games to choose from (and the first port of call for most indie titles, too), the options are endless. You also get the perks of (nearly always flawless) backward compatibility and console-beating graphical performance — if you've got the coin for it when you’re building your perfect kit or picking up a high-powered <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-gaming-laptops-172033838.html">gaming laptop</a>. The whole idea of what a gaming PC is and where you can play it is shifting, too, with the rise of handheld gaming PCs like the Steam Deck. We've tried to be broad with our recommendations here on purpose; here are the best PC games you can play right now.</p>
