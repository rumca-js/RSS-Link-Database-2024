Now, Elon Musk has <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1791351500217754008\">announced</a> that the social network is done moving all of its core systems on X.com, which means it's done transitioning into its new identity and scrubbing all traces of the name Twitter and its iconic blue bird logo. As <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/17/23829098/twitter-x-com-url-links-switch\"><em>The Verge</em></a> notes, the website has also edited its landing and log-in page with a note at the bottom that says: &quot;Welcome to x.com! We are letting you know that we are changing our URL, but your privacy and data protection settings remain the same.&quot; It then links to its Privacy page, which now uses x.com in its address.</p>\n<div id=\"c654a4c", "language": "en-US", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/twitter-has-officially-moved-to-xcom-120028269.html?src=rss", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "source_obj__id": 104, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2024-05%2F805d83e0-1431-11ef-b28b-6c2ba1ca8384&resize=1400%2C882&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=8503616c5bb0e051039db4e159804a69b7fde765", "title": "Twitter has officially moved to X.com", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-05-17T11:30:44+00:00", "description": "<p>We've spent some time with the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ipad-pro-2024-review-so-very-nice-and-so-very-expensive-210012937.html\">iPad Pro M4 </a>and new <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ipad-air-2024-review-of-course-this-is-the-ipad-to-get-210019225.html\">iPad Air</a>... and the iPad Pro is still a bit too pricey for us.
