M4-powered iPad Pro</a> was how light it was, closely followed by some sense of wonder at how thin it has become. </p>



<p>The model I’ve been using weighs just 0.98-pounds. (This is the version with both Wi-Fi and cellular capabilities; the equivalent 13-in. model weights 1.28 pounds.)</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>You got to carry that weight…</strong></h2>



<p>To put this into perspective, the previous generation 11-in. model weighed just a little more, 1.04-pounds — but that small, roughly 5% w

<p><em>Editor’s note: The UK parliament this week debated a proposal to exonerate those wrongfully convicted of fraud due to flaws in a Post Office computer system, while an independent public inquiry into a cover-up of the flaws heard evidence from former Post Office CIO Lesley Sewell. Here, Marcus Jerräng, editor in chief of </em>Computerworld Sweden<em>, gives an outsider’s perspective on a uniquely British affair.</em></p>
