How about when it suffered multiple delays? The lack of buzz for it was palpable, which probably explains the developer's recent decision to cancel it.\n\nIt makes sense if the publisher is moving away from chasing trends, much like when it cancelled Ghost Recon Frontline and Project Q. Diverting Red Storm to work on other projects is also pretty solid reasoning. However, the reason that led to Heartland's cancellation is still relatively unknown.\n\nThat is until you hear the reports of the playtest and players' responses to the same. Was The Division Heartland just an unfortunate victim of a developer cutting back on unessential projects, or was it not shaping up all that well? As it turns out, the answer is a little bit of both.", "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-KKACRP4ZE", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "source_obj__id": 129, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/W-KKACRP4ZE/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "What The HELL Happened To The Division Heartland?", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-05-17T12:45:03+00:00", "description": "F1 24 is Codemasters' latest racing sim, once again promising the most realistic depiction of Formula One racing.
