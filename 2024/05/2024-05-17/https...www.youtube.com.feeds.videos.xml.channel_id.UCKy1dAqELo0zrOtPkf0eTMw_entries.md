Diablo Immortal has had its ups and downs, just as its big brother Diablo IV has, but I have to admit the team working on Immortal has constantly been adding things that pique my interest. The Blood Knight was the first new class added to the Diablo franchise in nine years and it was an interesting spin on what I’d imagine a Castlevania protagonist would play like in the Diablo world. The Tempest is next and after playing for a while, I’m happy to report that the class adds an interesting set of new abilities and moves that make it a compelling option for players. I couldn’t tell if it would land in the S-tier category during my playtime, but it’s certainly got a lot of style that sets it apart from the others.

Our look at the DIablo Immortal Tempest Class will include an overview of wehat you can expect, but also some of the quality of life changes. The Diablo Immortal Paragon changes are significant and we'll go through the Diablo Immortal new Paragon Trees to give you a head start

In today's Daily Fix:
Via the Wall Street Journal, the next mainline Call of Duty game will likely launch straight to Xbox Game Pass later this year. The game, reportedly Black Ops 6, will be the first Call of Duty title to launch on Game Pass since publisher Activision was acquired by Microsoft in one of the biggest deals in video game history. Activision's previous head, Bobby Kotick, had not allowed the franchise on any subscription service, but since the acquisition things have obviously changed. In related Microsoft news, Redfall will finally get the last update that was promised. The update will include fixes to the Neighborhood and Nest systems, bug fixes, and an Offline Mode that players had been wanting since its disastrous release last year. Developer Arkane Austin was shuttered earlier this month, so it's surprising that this update will even happen. And finally, a new Total War game is in development, and if the rumors are true, it'll be set in the Star Wars universe. This

## Fired X-Men '97 Creator Beau DeMayo Clarifies Involvement In Season 2 - IGN The Fix: Entertainment

Though we still don’t know why he was fired, ex-showrunner of X-Men ‘97 Beau DeMayo took to Twitter to clarify his involvement in season 2 of the animated series. He tweeted, “I did write a lot of Season 2. However, unlike Season 1, I will not be heavily involved or leading production, cast records, design, editorial, post, music, etc., nor doing any production rewrites as it relates to the creative vision of the show.” Since he was unceremoniously dropped by Disney just before the premiere of the #XMen97 series, DeMayo seemingly took a break from social media - but returned weeks later, remaining active on Twitter, commenting on various plot points of the animated show. He gave us insight on where the Avengers are, and explained the friendship between Morph and Wolverine. In other news, we have a release date for Five Nights at Freddy’s 2 and a new Suicide Squad ISEKAI trailer featuring The Joker.

Welcome back to Next-Gen Console Watch. This week Daemon is joined by Unlocked's Ryan McCaffrey, and IGN's Community Lead, Jada Griffin to discuss Square Enix's sales woes. The company admits that the storied Final Fantasy franchise has not been selling well as of late, with the latest two entries not meeting expectations. As a result, Square Enix will be undergoing a restructuring of sorts, and many are pointing to their exclusivity deal with Sony as a cause. But is that fair? Maybe gamers just don't care about Final Fantasy as much as they used to? And how much can Xbox benefit if Square Enix decides to let all their franchises go multiplatform? Plus we have poll results and a new poll to vote on at IGN.com.

King Ghidorah and Hedorah join the Gigabash roster as part of the Nemesis 2 Kaiju Pack DLC. Check out the latest trailer for Gigabash to see these two new playable characters from the Godzilla universe in action in the Kaiju fighting game.

As seen in Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah (1991), King Ghidorah is Godzilla’s most formidable rival. Each of its colossal, horned heads can blast destructive lightning bolt-like Gravity Beams capable of tearing through entire skyscrapers. Its supersonic wings not only allow it to fly and rain destructive Gravity Beams from above but are also powerful enough to produce powerful shockwaves that uproot buildings and send them flying.

Hedorah is the smog monster that stands taller than Godzilla and can match the King of the Monsters blow for blow. As seen in Godzilla vs. Hedorah (1971), it can spit Acidic Sludge, throw mud balls at its enemy, and even shoot a Hedrium Ray from one of its eyes. It can also revert to its Flying Stage to escape attacks with s
