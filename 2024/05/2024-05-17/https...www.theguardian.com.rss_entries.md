## Oh, Canada review – Paul Schrader looks north as Richard Gere’s draft dodger reveals all

<p><strong>Cannes film festival<br /></strong>A dying director who fled from the US to Canada agrees to make a confessional film in Schrader’s fragmented and anticlimactic story</p><p>Muddled, anticlimactic and often diffidently performed, this oddly passionless new movie from Paul Schrader is a disappointment. It is based on the novel Foregone by Russell Banks (Schrader also adapted Banks’s novel Affliction in 1997) and reunites Schrader with Richard Gere, his star from American Gigolo. Though initially intriguing, it really fails to deliver the emotional revelation or self-knowledge that it appears to be leading up to. There are moments of intensity and promise; with a director of Schrader’s shrewdness and creative alertness, how could there not be? But the movie appears to circle endlessly around its own emotions and ideas without closing in.</p><p>The title is partly a reference to the national anthem of that nation, which is a place of freedom and opportunity which may have an al

There are tubs and tubs of the stuff, in all manner of flavours from almond and vanilla to pistachio and chocolate, and I like to pick up a different type each time I go. I use halva in bakes and, of course, I eat it neat, too. In today’s loaf, I’ve used a vanilla one that, as the cake bakes, melts into the batter, bringing a velvety texture to the sponge and a toasty, sesame flavour. The pops of blueberries brighten everything up and make this a perfect pick-me-up.</p><p>Discover this recipe and many more from your favourite cooks in <a href="https://app.adjust.com/1bgiux9n?creative=Endnotes&amp;fallback=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fhelp%2Finsideguardian%2F2024%2Fapr%2F17%2Fintroducing-the-feast-app&amp;redirect_macos=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fhelp%2Finsideguardian%2F202

<p>If Japanese food is all the rage, why isn’t sake? After all, it is an appealing and surprisingly versatile drink</p><p>Given how popular Japanese food is now, it’s kind of surprising that sake hasn’t taken off in tandem. But it’s also understandable, seeing as this is not exactly the easiest drink to get your head around: there’s the complex classification, and the fact that, until relatively recently, the labels have tended to be in Japanese. There’s also confusion over what temperature to serve it at (the general impression is that it’s served warm, but finer sakes are traditionally served cool or cold). The supermarkets, which are often helpful in popularising new drinks such as kombucha, haven’t come on board, either. Look up sake on the Asda website, for example, and <a href="https://groceries.asda.com/search/sake">you get 752 results for cake</a>.

<p>Writer and peer Daniel Finkelstein narrates his family’s extraordinary story with a mixture of horror and wonder</p><p>In this remarkable family memoir, the political journalist and Conservative peer Daniel Finkelstein documents the lives of his parents and grandparents under Hitler and Stalin, and “how the great forces of history crashed down in a terrible wave on two happy families; how it tossed them and turned them, and finally returned what was left to dry land”.</p><p>His mother Mirjam’s family, who were German Jews, survived the Dutch holding camp Westerbork, and a spell in Bergen-Belsen. Meanwhile his paternal grandfather, who was from Lwów in Poland (now Lviv, Ukraine), which was occupied by the Soviets in 1939, was arrested and sentenced to hard labour at one of Stalin’s gulags, while his wife and child were dispatched to a Siberian farm. Moving back and forth between their respective stories, Finkelstein’s account of his grandparents’ efforts to evade death and protect t

In the 1960s, one of the simplest and most powerful slogans of the African American civil rights movement was: “Freedom now!” With that slogan, the movement indicated that Black demands exceeded a narrow reading of legal rights and protections.

<p>Mixing growing speeds and heights is a great way of maximising your available garden space</p><p>Now that we are racing through May, I hope you’re surrounded by seedlings emerging and young plants putting down strong roots. It’s a good idea to sow about 20% more seeds than you have room to grow. I probably sow even more than that out of an abundance of caution and a sprinkling of self-doubt. Principally I do this because it’s rare that all my seeds germinate, but also so I have some extra seedlings to replace those I’ve planted out but haven’t made it through those dicey early weeks of life outside (especially as it’s so sluggy out there this season).</p><p>If all goes to plan and there’s plenty of germination, I use these bonus plants for interplanting. This is the practice of growing plants with different growth habits side by side to make the most of your space. It’s a creative and engaged way of growing crops, takes advantage of underused space, and foregoes regimented planting

<p>It was like I was trapped in a movie – with a hideous plot twist</p><p>I met Eric on a dating app in early 2018<strong> </strong>when I was living in New York. He was handsome, talkative and interesting. I was falling for him – but there was something he needed to know. In 2015, I’d been in love with a guy called Mike. On my 30th birthday, my parents threw me a party at their house. Everyone was having a great time until I heard my brother scream Mike’s name. As I ran towards the noise, I saw Mike on the ground by my parents’ pool.<strong> </strong>He’d slipped into the water and wasn’t breathing. I frantically tried to do CPR on him, but he remained unconscious.</p><p>At the hospital, I was told that Mike wouldn’t ever wake up. No one knows how he got hurt. He broke some bones in his back, and had a brain injury, but we don’t know how that happened.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/article/2024/may/17/experience-my-fiance-died-on-our-wedding-day-and-then-i-dis

<p>The actual cardi needn’t be fancy. The magic is in how you wear it and the attitude you bring</p><p>To dress “like a French girl” means to look not just chic, but charming too. Allow me to try to translate (I dress French better than I speak it these days). The “girl” bit matters, because it softens the Gallic hauteur. Our French girl is not a Parisian <em>madame</em>, ribs rattling against her Chanel suit like ice in a glass. The FG’s hair is a little messy (though her fringe is somehow always perfect) and her clothes are not box-fresh (neither are they scruffy). Her outfit never does too much (Emily in Paris is <em>not </em>an FG) but its details – jewellery, a scallop-edge scarf, a vintage bag – make her intriguing. You will find the FG doing something perfectly prosaic – reading her book on the metro, buying bread – in a way that is irresistibly alluring.</p><p>The latest prosaic thing the French girl makes bafflingly charming? Wearing a cardigan. When an English woman wears a

<p>The chancellor is expected to attempt to draw up an election battle line between the Conservatives and Labour over tax</p><p><strong>Jeremy Hunt</strong> has said it wasn’t a great insight that putting up taxes, “as I had to do in the autumn statement in 2022” is not popular.</p><p>He says “a future Labour government does not want to cut the tax burden, a future Conservative government will do.”</p><p>Our argument is this is about the future growth of the economy, because we can see looking around the world that more lightly taxed economies have more dynamic private sectors, they grow faster, and in the end that is more money for precious public services like the NHS.</p><p>So my challenge to the Labour Party today is simple.

Isn’t this what all streaming services do? They comb through their back catalog to see what IP can be exploited, promising both nostalgia and, of course, a fresh new spin on whatever thing you’ve already seen before. So while it was a given that a certain number of X-Men fans would be on board for X-Men ’97, which just completed its 10-episode first season with a second already on the way, it’s still a bit surprising that a revival of an ambitious, sometimes-clunky 90s-kid object of obsession would become one of the year’s most beloved TV shows.</p><p>Some of it may be hunger for any kind of ongoing X-Men ser

It’s a feeling that quickly becomes mutual: as we wait to be buzzed inside, Hill directs most of her chat towards her phone screen or the wall.

<p>A compelling debut digs into the conflicting emotions at the heart of an aristocratic family in 2010s England</p><p>The cast of Allen Bratton’s debut may sound familiar. Hal, the young heir to the house of Lancaster, wastes his hours in the Boar’s Head pub with his friends Poins&nbsp;and Falstaff. His father, Henry, tries to curtail his son’s bad behaviour, while seeking alliances that might shore up his troubled household. As&nbsp;the pair circle, enter Harry Percy, a&nbsp;dashing family friend who looks set&nbsp;to lock horns with Hal.</p><p>Names and themes from Shakespeare’s Henry IV echo through Henry Henry, which explores family, faith and aristocratic succession in 2010s England. Hal heads to pubs, kebab shops and parties, washing down cocaine with gin and beer. He is a rare visitor to the thinktank that nominally employs him, although he does manage to shuffle to morning mass and his father’s private members’ club, which he roguishly visits without a jacket and tie, so that
