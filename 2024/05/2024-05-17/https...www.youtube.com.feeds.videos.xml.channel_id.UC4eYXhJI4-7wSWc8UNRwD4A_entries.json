There is a historical DNA connecting the two traditions, but also linked by harmonic construction, ample room for improvisation and plain old swing.\n\nIn Luciana Souza\u2019s performance, all of the above is on display in the music from one of the most distinct voices in contemporary jazz. Backed by Trio Corrente from Brazil, Souza performs selections from their album Cometa, which received a 2024 Grammy nomination for best Latin jazz album. Souza\u2019s performance is a master class in how to play with intensity while keeping the volume down to accommodate the Tiny Desk\u2019s actual workspace.\n\nSET LIST\n\u201cBem Que Te Avisei\u201d\n\u201cBai\u00e3o Joy\u201d\n\u201cCometa\u201d\n\u201cQuando Voc\u00ea Vier\u201d\n\nMUSICIANS\nLuciana Souza: vocals\nFabio Torres: piano\nPaulo Paulelli: bass\nMauricio Zotarelli: drums\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Felix Contreras \nDirector/Editor: Kara Frame\nAudio Technical Director: Hannah Gluvna\nHost/Series", "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49zIojl1CM4", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A", "source_obj__id": 225, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/49zIojl1CM4/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Luciana Souza: Tiny Desk Concert", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
