We just can\u2019t see <em>it</em> happening. We\u2019ve crunched the numbers, weighed up the matchups, scoured the history books for precedent \u2013 right from when football began 32 years ago \u2013 and can\u2019t find any legitimate reasons to suggest Manchester City won\u2019t claim a fourth consecutive league title this weekend. Their relentlessness over the last two months has been somewhat of a kill-joy to what, for a while, seemed to be a genuinely compelling conclusion. They\u2019ve won eight league games on the bounce. They haven\u2019t lost since early December.
