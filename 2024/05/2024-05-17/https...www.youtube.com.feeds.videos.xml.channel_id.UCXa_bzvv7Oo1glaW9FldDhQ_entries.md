First-person shooters are dime a dozen in the current gaming landscape, but many of these games are subject to widespread homogenization meaning that there’s not much in the name of discriminating factors. 

As such, games that try to take the same concepts and create something fresh out of it continue to be a rare occurrence, but Starbreeze Studios’ 2012 release Syndicate is something that definitely belongs to this category. 

Despite a lukewarm critical and commercial reception, Syndicate’s visual aesthetics and gameplay mechanics make for a rather appealing combination that sadly many fans have missed out on. With this video, we will be taking a look back at Syndicate and discuss the game in length to better understand its merits and inherent flaws.

Remember when The Division Heartland was announced in 2021 and received all those playtests? How about when it suffered multiple delays? The lack of buzz for it was palpable, which probably explains the developer's recent decision to cancel it.

It makes sense if the publisher is moving away from chasing trends, much like when it cancelled Ghost Recon Frontline and Project Q. Diverting Red Storm to work on other projects is also pretty solid reasoning. However, the reason that led to Heartland's cancellation is still relatively unknown.

That is until you hear the reports of the playtest and players' responses to the same. Was The Division Heartland just an unfortunate victim of a developer cutting back on unessential projects, or was it not shaping up all that well? As it turns out, the answer is a little bit of both.
