I mainly use reverse proxies for accessing simple local services with SSL behind memorable URLs and haven't dipped my toes into anything more complex than integrating Authentik for SSO.

At first i was having an issue with ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS on caddy and fixed that by switching to Full(strict). all services are accessable, I host a unifi controller with about 30 sites connected to a CK-GEN2 and a meshcentral server with about 200 endpoints. Now after switching to cloudflare some of the unifi devices on varius sites randomly show offline and reconnect occasionally and some endpoints on meshcentral became offline. rebooting my mesh server will reconnect some of them but leave others that were previously online as now offline. In the traffic dashboard i see about 180k requests in 24 hours and im assuming thats mainly keep alive for unifi and mesh. Is there something i might be doing wrong here?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a ", "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1ctu6cz/switched_from_godaddy_to_cloudflare_as_domain", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/.rss", "source_obj__id": 450, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Switched from Godaddy to Cloudflare as domain registar and now having some minor connectivity issues", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-05-17T01:45:06+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hey <a href=\"/r/selfhosted\">/r/selfhosted</a>,</p> <p>I've been pretty much at <a href=\"https://chse.dev/hs\">end game for my software selfhosting journey</a> for a couple years now, I have some free time this summer and was wondering what (if any) <strong>hardware</strong> projects you guys run that make your lives easier / just plain fun.</p> <hr /> <p>For example, I just finished ripping a bunch of Home Videos to store on Plex so we actually might look back on them, rather than letting them succumb to disk rot. <em>(Although that was mostly software doing the heavy lifting...
