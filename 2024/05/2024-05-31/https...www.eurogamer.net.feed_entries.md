They're not impartial any more, if they ever were. These memories are a powerful thing to appeal to, and a smart way for a game to get attention, but it's also dangerous ground to tread. Because what if in aping the past, you undermine it? What if in the harsh light of reality, you expose old games for what they were - limited in comparison to what we have now?</p><p>I've been thinking about this because of two games: Skald, the Commodore 64-styled role-playing game, and Crow Country, the PlayStation 1-styled survival horror. Skald came out this week and we have a review in the works, and Crow Country came earlier in the month and our review aired this week. That's partially the reason I'm making Crow Country our

This week on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/newscast">Eurogamer Newscast</a>, we look back on the start of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/summer-game-fest-2024-conference-schedule">this year's June hype cycle, the period formerly known as E3</a>, now a potpourri of other events and announcement livestreams. </p><p>PlayStation got the ball rolling last night with its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-playstations-state-of-play-may-2024">latest State of Play broadcast</a>, which included a look ahead at its rather meagre first-party plans for the remainder of 2024: a moderately buffed-up port of Until Dawn, online shooter Concord, and the charming Astro Bot.

Spyro developer Toys for Bob has formally confirmed its next game will be published by Xbox, in a teasing statement that ends with a decidedly purple-coloured heart emoji. 
</p><p>
Toys for Bob was previously part of the now-Microsoft-owned Activision Blizzard, and made its name making Skylanders, then working on the Crash and Spyro trilogy releases. 
</p><p>
But more recent years saw it pulled into work on Call of Duty as a support developer, and earlier this year it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-layoffs-affect-86-staff-at-spyro-crash-bandicoot-studio">lost 89 staff members</a> as a part of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-to-lay-off-1900-people-across-xbox-and-activision-blizzard">Microsoft's wider layoffs of 1900 staff</a>.

## Can FSR 3 frame generation deliver the 120fps dream on PS5 and Xbox?

Frame generation technology has arrived on consoles, amplifying frame-rates and potentially transforming experiences. We shared initial thoughts earlier this week via DF Direct, but we've gone further now - testing out Immortals of Aveum's FSR 3 frame-gen implementation across all supported consoles. In all cases, the promise of a high frame-rate experience for 120Hz screens has been delivered - and what's fascinating is that it's Xbox Series S that gets closest to delivering 120 frames per second.
</p><p>
Before we go on, let's circle back and cover the basics. AMD's brand of frame generation tech is similar in principle to Nvidia's pioneering work with DLSS 3, the difference being that there's no hardware tie-in here - AMD does it all with software whereas Nvidia demands the use of RTX 40-series cards. Either way, two frames are gen

## It's hard to stay excited about the PlayStation VR2 if even Astro Bot won't wear one

Now, I'm not naive enough to believe that Half Life: Alyx is ever going to come to the headset (even though I desperately want it to) but, when one of my favourite VR games ever is the PSVR1 exclusive, Astro Bot Rescue Mission, I think it's fair to hold out hope for an Astro Bot Rescue Mission 2 for the PSVR2. (I mean, I'd even take backwards compatibility for the original Astro Bot Rescue Mission at this point!)</p><p>That's why yesterday's announcement of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-announces-new-astrobot-game" target="_blank">Astro Bot</a> was so bittersweet for me.

The next Epic Games Store freebie as part of the company's ongoing Mega Sale promotion will be Marvel's Midnight Suns.

That's according to <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/epic-games-store-voici-lultime-jeu-mystere-aaa-bientot-offert-sur-pc-51882">Dealabs</a>' always-reliable billbil-kun, who notes the game will be available to download next week from Thursday 6th until Thursday 13th June.
</p><p>
If you're yet to give it a go, Marvel's Midnight Suns is a brilliant character-centric role-player with Firaxis' trademark turn-based combat. Actions are made by cards, yes, but don't worry too much about that. It's fun, it's well-written, and being able to build up a secret base full of interesting Marvel superheroes is a blast.

Redfall's final ever update has been released, marking an end to Arkane Austin's work on the game - and indeed the now-shuttered studio's work in general.
</p><p>
Known as version 1.451.3.0 - a nod to video games' ongoing 0-4-5-1 easter egg, which dates back almost 30 years - this update adds features such as an offline mode and single player pausing, among others.
</p><p>
While these features have long been sought after - and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/redfall-developer-working-to-u-turn-on-single-player-always-online-restriction">long promised</a>, it is a bittersweet moment. This marks the end of the game's development, roughly two years after it first released.

The New York Times, owner of Wordle, is suing a one-man geography-guessing alternative project named Worldle. 
</p><p>
Hit puzzle game Wordle was the work of British designer Josh Wardle, until it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-york-times-buys-puzzle-game-phenomenon-wordle-for-seven-figure-sum">bought by The New York Times in 2022 for a seven-figure sum</a>. It's now operated as part of The New York Times' growing games portfolio and is played by millions daily. 
</p><p>
The browser-based <a href="https://worldledaily.com/">Worldle</a>, meanwhile, was built and is still run by one man - Seattle-based Kory McDonald, and has around 100,000 players each month.
