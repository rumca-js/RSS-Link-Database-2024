<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone,</p> <p>you did quite like my last articles and it has been a very long time since I have posted my last one. I am still on the journey, to document step by step my self-hosting setup, so others can follow along and build one for themselves. I don't just want to create articles for other to simply copy code from or paste the commands bit by bit. I would like to provide more background and some of my thoughts and learnings.</p> <p>This guide is about understanding the Docker basics and applying them in a Docker Compose file. I believe, once one has cracked the basic understanding of Docker, you can more or less get any service running.</p> <p>I know most of you know all this, but I hope there are a few out there, who it will help have an easier journey.</p> <p><a href="https://nerdyarticles.com/docker-101/">https://nerdyarticles.com/docker-101/</a></p> <p>By all means I am not a full blown expert, just trying to share my knowledge and learn

I’ll try to keep to short and sweet, so here’s what I’m working with:</p> <p>Intel i7-12700k </p> <p>1x) 1TB Crucial P3 Plus Gen4 NVMe M.2 </p> <p>3x) 6TB WD Red Plus NAS HDD</p> <p>My plan is to install the host OS (Proxmox) onto the 1TB M.2, and then to use the same drive for the guests (VMs). I figured this would give me the best performance, and as far as I understood, there shouldn’t be any issues using the same M.2 for the hosts and guests (correct me if I’m wrong).</p> <p>I then planned on using the 3 6TB HDD’s setup in RAID 5, as the pool for backups, the pool for Nextcloud/Owncloud (still haven’t decided), and anything else I need to put into cold storage.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I'm mostly looking for someone to sanity check this idea before I put in a bunch of work just to find out it doesn't work the way I want.</p> <p>I've setup a self-hosted kubernetes cluster, using MetalLB to give my ingress a LAN IP. I configured my local DNS to point to this IP to access various services (like a blog or jellyfin) on the cluster and with the brief, private testing I've done, port forwarded 80/443 to this IP on my router for external access. This works great and no issues.</p> <p>However ideally before I make things a bit more externally accessible, I'd like to setup a VPS that will act as the public IP of my services. The most sane way it appears to do this is to setup the VPS as a Wireguard server, have my cluster nodes act as clients (in some way) to that Wireguard network, and then have the VPS act as a reverse proxy to the now accessible cluster ingress (in some way).</p> <p>This is where things get a little fuzzy for me because wh

I want to create reverse a proxy for my Portainer, so portainer.example.com. My Caddyfile looks like this:</p> <pre><code>portainer.example.com { @internalNetwork { client_ip 192.168.0.0/16 } reverse_proxy @internalNetwork https://localhost:9443 { transport http { tls_insecure_skip_verify } } log } </code></pre> <p>My local DNS (PiHole) is correctly resolving &quot;portainer.example.com&quot; to the server Caddy is running on.
