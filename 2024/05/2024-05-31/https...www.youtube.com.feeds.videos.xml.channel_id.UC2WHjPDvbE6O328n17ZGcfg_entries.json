This is a custom website I've been wanting to build for a while, that has the \"wow\" factor of my terminal website thanks to three.js 3D graphics, interactive animations, and parallax, while maintaining an easy-to-use and intuitive design. This website gives a prospective client or employer a quick look at me and my work as a developer, showing them what I can do with not just the projects listed, but the website itself. And yes, I know the parallax gets tricky when shrinking the window, but I'll fix that... one day... maybe. Maybe one of y'all can fix it for me.\n\nIf you're reading this part, let me know what you think of this new video style I'm trying out, and comment \"SPACEMAN!!!\" below.\n\nTechnologies:\nVite - Build tool for the boilerplate and structure\nJav", "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_ZxgQQ74Lc", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC2WHjPDvbE6O328n17ZGcfg", "source_obj__id": 118, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/f_ZxgQQ74Lc/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "I Built a 3D Developer Portfolio Website // Three.js + React + Tailwind", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
