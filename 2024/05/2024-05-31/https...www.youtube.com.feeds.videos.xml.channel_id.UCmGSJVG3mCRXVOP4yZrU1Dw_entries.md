The Iran-Iraq War wasnâ€™t just a fight between two rival countries, both wanting the resources and power of the other. This war reshaped the entire middle east, setting up a dynamic that persists to this day: Iran fighting for revolutionary change, Saudi Arabia fighting for the status quo, and both sides fighting through their neighbors and allies, making wars worse and creating instability in their wake.
