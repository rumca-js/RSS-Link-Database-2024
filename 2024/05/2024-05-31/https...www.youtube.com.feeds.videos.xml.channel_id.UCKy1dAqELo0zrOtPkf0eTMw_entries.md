## F1 24 Review

F1 24 reviewed by Luke Reilly on Xbox Series X. Also available on Xbox One, PlayStation, and PC.

"In isolation, F1 24 remains a slick, deep, and marvellous motorsports experience. If you’re a racing gamer who’s just getting into F1 (or an F1 fan who’s just getting into gaming) it’s terrific stuff, packed with options, assists, and various other tweakable toggles to make it hugely approachable to F1 fans of all skill levels. However, if you’re a returning player of F1 23, and F1 22, and so on, it’s hard to deem F1 24 essential. Despite its refurbished career mode and handling overhaul, it’s basically a neck and neck finish with the last few years’ versions. And when you have a head start, that’s kind of a loss."

Get your hot 'n fresh PlayStation updates here, folks! In just over a half hour, Sony unveiled looks at what gamers can expect for the rest of the year and beyond! As was heavily rumored, God of War: Ragnarok is coming to PC, and there were reveals for games like Astro Bot (more like Astro BOP! with that song in the trailer,) Dynasty Warriors: Origins, Skydance's Behemoth, Infinity Nikki, and Ballad of Antara. We got our first look at gameplay from Firewalk's upcoming 5v5 shooter Concord and new trailers for Silent Hill 2, Where Winds Meet, the Until Dawn remaster, Monster Hunter: Wilds, Path of Exile 2, and Marvel Rivals. Plus, PSVR2 owners got a terrifying glimpse of Alien: Rogue Incursion, which seems to ask the question "what if we strapped Alien: Isolation to your face and let the Xenomorph pounce straight into your eyes?" That's an answer we'll look forward to getting when the game launches this holiday season.

## Infinity Nikki: The First Preview

On the one hand, Infinity Nikki is the console-ready follow-up to the Miracle Nikki and Shining Nikki series of dress-up games on mobile from Chinese game publisher Infold. On the other, it takes some influence from The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, with ex-Nintendo BOTW director Kentaro Tominaga as its executive producer. And as I discovered from three hours playing a packed new demo on PC, Infinity Nikki blends the best of these two disparate worlds – and tucks a ton of surprises under its sparkly belt.
