If you want a TV box that's more flexible than Apple TV, Nvidia SHIELD, Roku Ultra, or any of the regular Android-based TV set-top boxes, this Pi build's for you!

I built a Raspberry Pi 5 media center using LibreELEC and Kodi, and I'll show you how you can do it, too. It's good enough for almost any modern content, up to 4K60, but there are a few caveats.
