<p>As announced earlier this week, Mike Flanagan has officially signed on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/exorcist-trilogy-canceled-mike-flanagan-will-direct-franchise-reboot-movie/1100-6523801/">to direct the next Exorcist movie,</a> which is a clean break from the previously planned trilogy. Flanagan has a "radical new take" on the classic franchise. But that doesn't mean he isn't intimidated by the task at hand.</p><p>"For The Exorcist specifically, I'm f***ing terrified," said Flanagan at an ATX panel via <a href="https://www.slashfilm.com/1593633/exorcist-director-mike-flanagan-terrified-taking-on-horror-classic">SlashFilm</a>. The director gave that answer in response to a question about handling the creative freedom to do what he wants, along with the pressure of living up to the expectations that come with the franchise.</p><p>"With The Exorcist, there's a lot of pressure, but thankfully there are a lot of bodies on the field of people who have stepped on landmines,

<p>Call of Duty is one of gaming's biggest series. Xbox Game Pass is one of gaming's biggest services. It only makes sense then that one of Xbox's priorities--particularly after purchasing Call of Duty's publisher, Activision--was ensuring the next title in the series is available on Game Pass.</p><p>Fortunately for Xbox and Call of Duty fans already subscribed to Game Pass, Microsoft recently confirmed that the next Call of Duty, Black Ops 6, will be included in the subscription service. Yet we can't help but wonder if having Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 on Game Pass will actually move the needle for Microsoft. Sure, Call of Duty has a built in, loyal fanbase, but will fans who traditionally play on other consoles be motivated to enter the Microsoft ecosystem? Will those not wanting to shell out $70 to purchase the game outright be attracted by Game Pass' lower price point? </p><p>On this week’s Spot On, Tam and Lucy discuss that state of Microsoft and AAA gaming in general, the potenti

Ghost of Tsushima is the latest to uphold this trend, with developer Nixxes showing yet again how valuable of a purchase it was in the pursuit of this PC-focused endeavor. Taking the work done by Sucker Punch on the PlayStation 4 and translating it to a smooth PC experience might sound trivial in the face of more demanding projects such as Returnal and Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart, but it doesn't make the final product any less impressive when you're able to get it running far beyond even the PlayStation 5 version's level of visuals and performance.</p><div>          </div><p dir="ltr">Ghost of Tsushima on PC is the complete package, including the post-launch multiplayer mode Legends (which requires a PSN account to play) and the entertaining <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/ghost-of-tsushima-iki-island

<p>Embracer CEO Lars Wingefors has commented on the possibility of raising the price of major games from the industry standard of $70 to something above that. Speaking to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/embracers-lars-wingefors-on-the-brutal-truth-of-the-aaa-market">GI.biz</a>, Wingefors said the video game industry is no different than other businesses in that inflation and production costs continue to rise.</p><p>Wingefors said it's been "hard" to increase price for premium games in the console and PC space, and due to this, "the margin to success is less." Prices beyond $70 for new game releases is not out of the realm of possibility, Wingefors said, and it might take one company being a first-mover and seeing how the market responds.</p><p>"The reality is no one has tried it. If you create an enormous RPG, for example, with 100 or 150 hours of gameplay, very polished and a unique experience, would the consumer be willing to pay more? If they would, they would have more prod
