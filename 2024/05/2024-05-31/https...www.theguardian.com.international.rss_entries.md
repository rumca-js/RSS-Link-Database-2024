Although there is something totally new at one point: an actual joke</p><p>Like many, I had to remove myself from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-walking-dead">The Walking Dead</a>’s viewership around the time Negan took his bat to the heads of two long-running characters whose identities and deaths had been relentlessly teased by producers all through the sixth series, and even slightly into the seventh. What had been increasingly obvious for a long time became unignorable: this was a show that had long ago abandoned any thematic interests or narrative purpose in favour of simply devising worse and worse ways for people to die.

They wanted to take him out&nbsp;of his ever-evolving comfort zone, though that was somewhere he rarely stayed long.</p><p>Birmingham sent Bellingham on a kind of footballing school exchange, to Cornellà and Freiburg, teams in Spain and Germany with whom they had links, to give him a taste of European football.

<p>From ballet-dancing in New York to playing a Bond villain, Trinidad-born brothers Boscoe and Geoffrey Holder led extraordinary lives. But it’s as trailblazing painters of black portraits and nudes that they will be remembered</p><p>The first time I ever saw a black male nude was in a Boscoe Holder painting in a private collection in Trinidad. It was beautiful – and so brazen that I wondered whether it broke the country’s lingering Victorian-era indecency laws. I would later discover he had painted hundreds more, many for his eyes only, never intended to be shown in his lifetime.</p><p>From Saturday at Victoria Miro in London, many will be shown in a joint exhibition with his younger brother Geoffrey, whose similarly radiant, sensual paintings of black men and women reflect just how far ahead of their time the Holder brothers were. Born in Port of Spain, Boscoe in 1921 and Geoffrey in1930, to an inspired middle-class mother from Martinique and an upwardly mobile Bajan father, the si

<p>The youngest was 21 and the oldest 80. The effort people made blew me away</p><p>At 5.45am on 14 February this year, I&nbsp;was in my kitchen making spaghetti bolognese and questioning my life choices. As a performance artist, I’m used to putting myself in unusual scenarios, but nothing quite like this. I&nbsp;was getting ready to go on 100 dates over the next 17 hours. I’m normally nervous to go on just one.</p><p>I’ve lived in London for 10 years, and had somehow managed to spend all previous Valentine’s Days here involved in some romantic escapade. But this year would be the first in a while that I would be alone on the day. To avoid being alone with my own thoughts, I came up with the idea of having 100 dates in a day. Selfish in its initial conception, the project ended up providing a space to explore genuine online connection.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/article/2024/may/31/experience-i-went-on-100-dates-in-a-day">Continue reading...</a>
