Hello guys and gals, it's me Mutahar again! This time we take a look at what appears to be a situation where plenty of "gaming" versions of Windows are being freely distributed on YouTube, these are some of the sketchiest downloads I've seen in all my time and it's high time YouTube step in, but before that can happen it's best to educate why you should never install an operating system unless you get it right from the source. Thanks for watching!
