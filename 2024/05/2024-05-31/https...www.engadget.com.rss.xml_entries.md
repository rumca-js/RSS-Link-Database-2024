<p>When you think of the 20-year-old social network that is Facebook, its popularity among “young adults” is <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/20-years-later-facebook-is-a-supporting-character-in-the-mark-zuckerberg-universe-140044870.html"><ins>probably not</ins></a> what comes to mind. Naturally, Meta wants to change that and the company is once again telling the world it intends to reorient its platform in order to appeal to that demographic.</p>
<p>In <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://about.fb.com/news/2024/05/the-future-of-facebook/"><ins>an update</ins></a> from Tom Alison, who heads up the Facebook app for Meta, he says that the service is shifting to reflect an “increased focus on young adults” compared with other users. “Facebook is still for everyone, but in order to build for the next generation of social media consumers, we’ve made significant changes with young adults in mind,” he wrote.</p>

<p>Former Activision studio Toys for Bob <a href="https://x.com/ToysForBob/status/1796556809660207498"><ins>just announced a partnership with Xbox</ins></a> to release its first game after spinning off as an independent entity. The company, which developed recent entries in the Spyro the Dragon and Crash Bandicoot franchises, hasn’t released any concrete details about its upcoming release, except to say that it’s early in development and that the team has been working hard.</p>
<p>This is, of course, something of a homecoming for the developer. Activision is owned by Microsoft, making Toys for Bob its… former grandchild? In any event, it’s likely easy to get pitch meetings and the like with a company you’ve worked with in the past. Also, the developer has a fairly stellar pedigree, having created the Skylanders franchise and the <a href="http://release/"><ins>well-reviewed </ins><em><ins>Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time</ins></em></a>, among others.</p>

<p>The Apple Vision Pro is heavy and would most certainly become an annoying anchor on your face if you tried to use it for an entire eight-hour workday. That’s because all of the tech is stuffed into the headset itself. A company called Sightful is addressing this issue with its <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240530098029/en/Introducing-Spacetop-G1-The-Laptop-For-The-Spatial-Computing-Era"><ins>Spacetop G1 system</ins></a>. It’s a laptop with no screen paired with AR glasses that runs custom OS and not Windows. All of the heavy stuff is inside of the laptop, so the glasses weigh, you know, about as much as a pair of glasses.</p>
<p>The company’s calling it “the laptop for the spatial computing era”, lifting a bit of Apple’s marketing language. It’s basically a pair of customized AR glasses from Xreal connected to something resembling the bottom section of a laptop, complete with a keyboard and trackpad. Sightful says this allows for a 100-inch virtual screen that f

So began Marvel and ILM Interactive's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/marvels-what-if-for-apple-vision-pro-gets-a-trailer-and-release-date-150008952.html"><em>What If...? on the Apple Vision Pro</em></a>. Like the Disney+ series and comics of the same name, this interactive experience recontextualizes Marvel's characters in a variety of intriguing ways — <em>what if</em> the Allies never won World War 2 and the Captain America experiment was a failure, for example.</p>
<p><em>What If...? </em> has always been a fun concept, but can it actually be transformed into a worthwhile augmented reality showpiece? Well, yes and no — at least, based on the hour I spent with it on the Apple Vision Pro.</p>

<p>The United States notoriously makes tax filing stressful and expensive thanks to greed, the tax lobby and the idea that basically nothing should be free (fun stuff!). However, there's a little glimmer of hope, as the IRS is making <a href="https://www.engadget.com/you-can-try-the-irs-alternative-to-turbo-tax-in-12-states-today-125757658.html">Direct File</a>, its free digital tool announced in late 2023, permanent. <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2385">According to the US Department of the Treasury</a>, a Direct File pilot program saved 140,000 individuals an estimated $5.6 million in filing costs for the 2024 tax session.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Whether you have kids tracking in dirt on a daily basis or a few fur-shedding pets (or both), a robot vacuum can help keep your home clean. Vacuuming doesn't have to be a daily chore for which you alone are responsible — robot vacuum cleaners have gotten even better in recent years, to the point where they're better at navigating around your home, and some of them can even mop hard floors in addition to sucking up debris. Yes, they are on the expensive side of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-smart-home-devices-154557162.html">smart home gadget</a> spectrum, but there are more midrange and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-budget-robot-vacuums-133030847.html">affordable</a> options today than ever before.

<p>A misdelivered order, theft and a hasty return: those are the three acts comprising Playdate's recent real-life adventure. According to the <a href="https://x.com/playdate/status/1796277575901401404">handheld gaming system's account on X</a> (formerly Twitter), FedEx dropped off $400,000 worth of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/playdate-revisited-two-years-with-the-little-yellow-inspiration-machine-125517060.html">Playdates</a> to a construction site near their actual warehouse destination. Then, poof, it was all gone — but that wasn't the last of it. Suddenly, the shipment reappeared, not at the warehouse door but in front of a random restaurant. The return was seemingly quick, with some packages toppled over and entering the street.</p>
<p>We don't know who was behind the theft and eventual return, though no one seems too bothered, as a follow-up post says the necessary detective work was &quot;enjoyed.&quot; Plus, the account (jokingly?) pitched selling these devices as a limi

<p>Apple is working on a version of its Siri voice assistant that will use advanced AI powered by large language models (LLMs), <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-30/apple-ios-18-siri-ai-update-will-let-users-control-features-in-apps-with-voice"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> has reported.

<p>The new version of Siri will only work on Apple's own apps to start with. It won't arrive with iOS 18 but may be released subsequently as an update early next year, the report states.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The assistant will be able to analyze your phone's activity and automatically enable Siri-controlled features. It'll support "hundreds" of commands but will only be able to process one at a time at first, according to the article. Later, Siri will support multiple tasks in a single request.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Liz Reid, head of Google Search, has admitted the company’s search engine has returned some <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-is-putting-more-restrictions-on-ai-overviews-after-it-told-people-to-put-glue-on-pizza-011316780.html">“odd, inaccurate or unhelpful AI Overviews</a>” after the feature rolled out to everyone in the US.</p>
<p>The executive’s<a href="https://blog.google/products/search/ai-overviews-update-may-2024/"> explanation</a> outlined some new safeguards to help the new feature return more accurate (and less funny) results. Some of the worst AI Overview results doing the rounds were apparently faked, but the glue-on-pizza example was real, as was the viral answer to how many rocks you should be eating. Also real. Reid said Google came up with an answer because it had tapped into a comedy satire site.</p>
<p>The issue for Google is this could erode trust in the search engine’s results and accuracy. Reid said the company tested the feature extensively before laun

<p>In other news, Nate explains why Google is adding a slew of AI features to Chromebook Plus notebooks, and we dive into the Fitbit Ace with LTE, which has the potential to be a very useful smartwatch tracker for kids.</p>

<p>Acer has unveiled the new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/acer-helios-300-spatiallabs-3d-134517554-134517437.html">SpatialLabs</a> Eyes Stereo Camera specifically for those who want to take 3D photos and videos. Users can not only use it to capture 3D content, but also to livestream in 3D on YouTube and other platforms, as well as to make 3D video calls on Teams, Zoom and Google Meet. The company describes the camera as &quot;compact&quot; and &quot;pocket-sized,&quot; with dimensions measuring 4 x 2.6 x 0.9 inches.</p>
<p>It has a resolution of 8 megapixels per eye and a built-in selfie mirror encased in a weather-proof shell. The more casual users can take advantage of its Electronic Image Stabilization (EIS) feature, along with its auto and touch focus capabilities. But experienced photographers can customize their output as much as they want to in manual mode, which will allow them to adjust the camera's ISO, white balance and shutter speed settings.&nbsp;</p>

The models — Predator X27U F3, Predator X34 X5 and Predator X32 X3 — work with NVIDIA's G-SYNC and AMD's FreeSync Premium Pro technologies to prevent tearing, stuttering, ghosting and input lags while you're gaming. They also feature true 10-bit color depth enhanced by a 99 percent coverage of the DCI-P3 color space, which means more color depths, higher contrasts and deeper blacks. The models come with stands with adjustable height that can tilt and swivel, and they're all equipped with two 5-watt speakers.</p>
<p>The Predator X27U F3 is a 27-inch monitor with a 2,560 x 1,440 pixel resolution and a 480 Hz refresh rate. It's outfitted with a USB-C and two HDMI 2.1 ports, and its stand has a tripod mount socket that can support
