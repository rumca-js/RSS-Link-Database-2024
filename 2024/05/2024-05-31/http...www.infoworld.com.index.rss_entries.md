<p>This month in Python (and elsewhere): Python 3.13's first beta has arrived, with new features you can try out now (yeah!) and others you'll need to compile from source to experiment with (yikes). Layoffs strike Google—yes, again—with internal Python devs among the affected. And, say hello to Streamlit, a library for those who are itching to write web-based Python apps but hate writing for the web.</p><h3>Top picks for Python readers on InfoWorld</h3>

<p>If ever there were a salient example of a counter-intuitive technique, it would be quantization of neural networks. Quantization reduces the precision of the weights and other tensors in neural network models, often drastically. It’s no surprise that reducing the precision of weights and other parameters from, say, 32-bit floats to 8-bit integers, makes the model run faster, and allows it to run in less powerful processors with far less memory. The stunning, counter-intuitive finding is that <em>quantization can be done while largely preserving the accuracy of the model</em>.</p><p>Why do we need quantization? The current <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3709489/large-language-models-the-foundations-of-generative-ai.html">large language models</a> (LLMs) are enormous. The best models need to run on a cluster of server-class GPUs; gone are the days where you could run a state-of-the-art model locally on one GPU and get quick results. Quant
