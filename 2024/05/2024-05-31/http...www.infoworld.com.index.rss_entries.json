Quantization reduces the precision of the weights and other tensors in neural network models, often drastically. It\u2019s no surprise that reducing the precision of weights and other parameters from, say, 32-bit floats to 8-bit integers, makes the model run faster, and allows it to run in less powerful processors with far less memory. The stunning, counter-intuitive finding is that <em>quantization can be done while largely preserving the accuracy of the model</em>.</p><p>Why do we need quantization?
