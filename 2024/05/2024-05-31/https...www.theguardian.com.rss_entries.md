<p>The German club have shed their youth-oriented, profit-hungry model to reach new heights and a Champions League final</p><p>All week, and by small degrees, London has been turning yellow and black. Stickers on Tube escalators. Scarves tied to lampposts. A BVB-emblazoned padlock on the banks of the Thames at Westminster. Wide-eyed fans milling through the pubs of Soho, wincing at the beer prices. Trying to soak up every last available morsel of enjoyment from the experience before – you know – the actual football starts.</p><p>It’s a largely moot point whether Borussia Dortmund are the biggest final outsiders in the modern history of the Champions League. Perhaps Internazionale last season, perhaps Liverpool in 2005. Either way, given the opposition, their fifth-placed finish in the Bundesliga and the charmed passage they have enjoyed to the final, few give them a hope at Wembley on Saturday night.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/may/31/new-age-dortmun

<p>He is backed by the FA and has three strong tournament runs behind him but could this be his last tilt at international glory?</p><p>When the Gareth Southgate interview from L’Équipe bounced back to England on 14 May, it was the prompt for a few phone calls between newspaper desks and their reporters. The England manager, preparing for Euro 2024 and under contract with the Football Association until December, had been asked the obligatory, inevitable question. Would this summer be his last shot at tournament glory with the team? Now we picked over his answer. Was there anything new in it?</p><p>The first thing to say was that even though it was most assuredly Southgate – speaking at the FA’s international media day – it did not sound completely like him. “If we don’t win, there is indeed a good chance that I won’t stay in office.” It was just the turn of phrase. Then again, here we had an Englishman speaking in English, being translated into French and back again into English.</p>

The song’s creator and fans explain an unlikely revival</p><p>Gala’s jubilant pop-dance banger Freed from Desire was a massive hit across Europe in the peak stadium-rave summer of 1996. But the story of the track was only just beginning. More than a decade later, it would become one of those rare pop songs to transcend its origins. Beginning a new life at Wigan Athletic football club in 2016 and going international via its adoption by Northern Ireland fans at the European Championships that year, it would become ubiquitous: an anthem for football fans the world over. Tune into any game of Euro 2024 this month and you’re likely to hear the song’s inescapably catchy “Na na na na na … ” chorus, accompanied by crowds gleefully leaping up and down.

Theirs is a sound of stifling humidity, a near hallucinatory heaviosity. Indeed, the narcotic heat of Louisiana – the band are from Baton Rouge – seeps through every sickly pore, wedding itself to the circling riffs, loose rhythmic under-swing and throat shredding screams alike: a brutal urban blues.</p><p>But where 2014’s breakthrough Heathen was of a more epic, doomy bent, Umbilical – the band’s sixth full length album – speaks more closely to Thou’s links to the underground punk and hardcore scenes with shorter, (even) more aggressive songs and in-your-face delivery.

<p>Progress was crystalised in Tahiti this week as elite female surfers fearlessly charged one of the globe’s most testing waves</p><p>Asked two years ago about the advancement towards gender equality in surfing, Australia’s Tyler Wright <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/22/sports/surfing-pipeline-women-oahu.html">told the New York Times</a> that “it takes a lot of minor, small, minute shifts for progress to really happen”. But sometimes, those incremental steps culminate in a decisive moment. Change, to paraphrase Ernest Hemmingway, can come gradually and then all at once.</p><p>This week, that moment came for women’s surfing. In heaving eight to 10ft swell at Teahupo’o in Tahiti, renowned as one of the most fearsome waves in the world, the best female surfers put on a spectacular show. “Teahupo’o is for the women after all,” exclaimed event winner Vahine Fierro, following one of the most exhilarating days of competitive surfing in the sport’s history.</p> <a href="https://www
