I came across the a500 mini but notice it comes preloaded with only games and not the entire OS. That being said I'm pretty sure octa med came with the OS, meaning I would have to install OctaMed onto the mini, if possible. So I was wondering A. If that was even possible, and B. How I could do so with a USB drive if it was possible.
