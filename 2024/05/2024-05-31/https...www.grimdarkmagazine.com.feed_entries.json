He published The Dwarves in 2003 (its English translation was released in 2009) and has been a professional author since. His work spans from dark epic fantasy to horror and thrillers, and even to games writing and children&#8217;s books. In The Return of the Dwarves, we return to the beloved world for new adventures. Heitz is one of my foundational authors, kindling a love for fantasy back in my school days, so it&#8217;s particularly exciting to be able to speak to him about his new book, returning to familiar worlds and international editions. [GdM] Can you introduce The Return of the Dwarves to our audience in a sentence or two? [MH] Well&#8230; the dwarves are returning. I always endeavour to ensure that the title and content are congruent. I don&#8217;t want to spoil anything about the content. For dramaturgical reasons. \ud83d\ude09 But I can reveal that there will be a few surprises on this return.
