They\u2019re sitting there thinking, \u2018They\u2019re telling me this is art, but I\u2019m spending $100 million on this art each year.\u2019 That\u2019s not reassuring.</p></blockquote><p class=\"cite\">&mdash; <a href=\"https://review.firstround.com/unexpected-anti-patterns-for-engineering-leaders-lessons-from-stripe-uber-carta/\">Will Larson</a>", "language": "en-us", "link": "https://simonwillison.net/2024/May/31/will-larson/#atom-everything", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://simonwillison.net/atom/everything", "source_obj__id": 423, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Quoting Will Larson", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-05-31T16:53:33+00:00", "description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/facebook-customer-support-scam-1.7219581\">Man caught in scam after AI told him fake Facebook customer support number was legitimate</a></p>\nThis one illustrates a nasty edge-case if you ship any kind of chatbot with your company's name attached to it.</p>\n<p>The scam victim here searches Google for a customer support phone number for Facebook, and came across a suspicious looking phone number.</p>\n<p>He pasted that number into the Meta AI chatbot in Facebook Messenger and asked \"is it a Facebook help line?\" - and a Meta AI answered:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The phone number 1-xxx-xxx-xxxx is indeed a legitimate Facebook support number.
