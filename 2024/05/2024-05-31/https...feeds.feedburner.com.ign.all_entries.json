the ball, titular heroine Nikki is thrown headlong into adventure when she finds an enchanted red and purple glittering dress in a wardrobe. Dancing with the dress, it suddenly pulls her and her talking cat-like pet/BFF Momo into a fantastical, mysterious realm.

It\u2019s like The Wizard of Oz meets Final Fantasy meets Paris Fashion Week, with a healthy sprinkling of Gravity Rush and The Neverending Story for good measure.", "language": null, "link": "https://www.ign.com/articles/infinity-nikki-the-first-hands-on-preview", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://feeds.feedburner.com/ign/all", "source_obj__id": 147, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/30/infinitynikki-firstpreview-blogroll-1717030993645.jpg", "title": "Infinity Nikki: The First Hands-On Preview", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-05-31T00:29:27+00:00", "description": "This is why Christophe Gans\u2019 2006 movie version of Silent Hill was one of the first good video game adaptations.", "language": null, "link": "https://www.ign.com/articles/how-silent-hill-paved-the-way-for-the-video-game-adaptation-craze", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://feeds.feedburner.com/ign/all", "source_obj__id": 147, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/31/silent-hill-movie-thumb-1717115024586.jpg", "title": "How Silent Hill Paved the Way for the Video Game Adaptation Craze", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-05-31T00:00:00+00:00", "description": "Wondering how to watch Saw X?
