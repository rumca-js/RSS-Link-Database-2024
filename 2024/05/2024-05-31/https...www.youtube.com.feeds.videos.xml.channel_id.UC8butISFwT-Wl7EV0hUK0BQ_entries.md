On this week's episode of the podcast, freeCodeCamp founder Quincy Larson interviews Suz Hinton. She's a software engineer, security researcher, and one of the first ever people to live-stream her coding on Twitch.

We talk about:
How Suz started her career building browser ads in Adobe Flash, working around bandwidth early 2000s limitations.
How she moved to the US from Melbourne to work at Zappos, and then Microsoft and Stripe.
Her love of hardware and embedded development
How she went back to school to study infosec, and launched a second career as a security researcher
How she nearly burned out after 20 years in tech, and what she's doing to recover.

Can you guess what song I'm playing on my bass during the intro? It's a 2015 song from an Australian musician.
