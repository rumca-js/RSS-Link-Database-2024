Thanks to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/28/24166177/google-search-ranking-algorithm-leak-documents-link-seo\">a huge leak of API documentation</a>, we got an unprecedented look at what Google cares about, how it ranks content, and how it thinks the internet should work. The leaked documentation is dense, and it doesn\u2019t tell us everything about how Google ranks, but it does offer a set of signals we\u2019ve never seen before. </p>\n<p id=\"mc5", "language": "en-US", "link": "https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/31/24168605/google-search-api-leak-openai-media-vergecast", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "source_obj__id": 359, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Inside the Google algorithm", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-05-31T10:45:19+00:00", "description": "<figure>\n      <img alt=\"Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs Eyes Stereo Camera in front of different SpatialLabs devices\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FogvOGRVa3EmlphRT7honMfMlXU=/26x213:1000x862/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73379924/Acer_SpatialLabs_Eyes_PCs_and_Displays.0.jpeg\" />\n        <figcaption><em>The Acer SpatialLabs Eyes Stereo Camera fully integrates with the rest of Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs device lineup.</em> | Image: Acer</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n\n  <p id=\"n2iq3O\">Acer isn\u2019t a brand that you\u2019d typically associate with photography, but its new camera offering comes with an interesting twist \u2014 the ability to snap pictures and video in stereoscopic 3D.
