You may have a lot of miniatures in your so-called "pile of shame" - but I might have more. And that pile of shame has real value!

Vince Venturella and I made a NEW game! Check out Deth Wizards - Necromantic Skirmish, Solo, and Co-op Combat at http://www.dethwizardsgame.com

I'm now a partner on Twitch! I paint minis every Friday morning and Monday night, and sometimes take paint breaks (play video games poorly). Follow me: http://www.twitch.tv/tabletopminions
