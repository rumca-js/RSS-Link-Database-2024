But I don&#8217;t know how he (or any other pronoun! &#8212; it&#8217;s filed as &#8220;Doe&#8221;) expects [&#8230;]

Challenging regimes where a single satirical post, a meme, or a critical blog can put someone behind bars requires bravery. [&#8230;]

This week all nine Supreme Court justices found in favor of the NRA.
