								<p>The Don&rsquo;t Starve board game was demoing at UK Games Expo this weekend, and I didn&rsquo;t miss the chance to check it out. From our first impressions, it seems to do a good job simulating the exploration and survival elements of the video game, but it&rsquo;s also quite the space hogger. Plus in the demos &hellip; <a href="https://www.wargamer.com/dont-starve-board-game/first-impressions">Continued</a></p>

								<p>The next Undaunted board game release, Undaunted 2200: Callisto, is a rapid departure for the series. Previously this strategy game, which blends elements of deck builders and wargames, has explored different battlegrounds of WW2. But now it&rsquo;s gone full sci-fi, depicting a fictional conflict between miners and corporations on a Jovian moon.

## Horus Heresy is over, Warhammer 40k needs a new civil war

								<p><strong>Warhammer 40k</strong> is full of amazing stories, but, for me, none carry the same epic scope and gravitas of its prequel saga, the Horus Heresy. It's a grand tragedy built on weighty ideas - but above all, it's a story where things <em>change</em>. The 'current' era of 40k lore, by contrast, feels like it's in stasis; the Imperium's peril escalates endlessly, but somehow it stays basically the same. I'm desperate for a story where it finally cracks; where humanity once again fights its most interesting enemy: itself. <strong>40k needs another civil war.</strong></p>

## Games Workshop’s non-Warhammer hit is now a huge 94% off

								<p><strong>Talisman: Digital Edition</strong> is the digital version of the criminally underrated board game from Warhammer creator Games Workshop, and it's at the heart of the latest Humble Bundle. It not only gathers together the game and all its DLC - but also Talisman Origins and all of <em>its</em> DLC, too. If you’ve always wanted to give Talisman a go, or are just hearing about it for the first time, you’ll probably never find it this cheap again. Usually, you’d be paying $162 (£127.48) for all of this, but right now it’s just $10 (£7.86).</p>
