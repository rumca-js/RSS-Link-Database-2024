<p>If there&rsquo;s one trend in PCs for 2024, it&rsquo;s &ldquo;AI&rdquo; in everything. That&rsquo;s inescapable. (Ugh.) But if there are two, then the second one is OLED monitors finally gaining steam.</p>



<p>Case in point: Acer just showed off three brand new designs in its Predator lineup, all sporting gorgeous and speedy OLED panels.</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s video games can take up a lot of space, so it&rsquo;s not uncommon to find yourself needing more storage &mdash; even on a Steam Deck.</p>
