This may be a lie with ulterior motives.\nSupport independent research and analysis by joining my Patreon page: https://www.patreon.com/thehatedone \n\nThere is a powerful motivation to keep you thinking that AI is an existential threat. That we should treat it with the same level of urgency as a nuclear war or a global pandemic. \nAnd yet, we shouldn\u2019t stop developing AI. We should accelerate it as fast as we can. As long as it\u2019s the select few good guys that get to control it. We must not let AI fall into wrong hands. \n\nBut there is a growing opposition to this movement. A conflict is arising. There is those that want to keep AI closed off and tightly controlled and those that want to leave it open and accessible to all. Even though both sides claim they are doing for humanity, only of them is right. This is an arms race for who gets to dominate AI development and who will be left out. \n\nSources\n[0]https://www.wire", "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NUD7rdbCm8", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCjr2bPAyPV7t35MvcgT3W8Q", "source_obj__id": 344, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/5NUD7rdbCm8/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Why you shouldn't believe the AI extinction lie", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
