Despite minor changes, it suffers from the same fundamental flaws as its </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/118/bills/s1409/BILLS-118s1409rs.pdf"><span>Senate counterpart</span></a><span>. At its core, this bill is still an unconstitutional censorship bill that restricts protected online speech and gives the government the power to target services and content it finds objectionable. Here, we break down why the House version of KOSA is just as dangerous as the Senate version, and why it’s crucial to continue opposing it.  </span><span><br /></span></p>
