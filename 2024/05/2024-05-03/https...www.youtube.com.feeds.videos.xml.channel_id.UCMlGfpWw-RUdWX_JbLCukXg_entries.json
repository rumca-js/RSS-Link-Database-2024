You know something bad happened, and you kinda know what, but you don't have any context on what the program was trying to do, or why it was trying to do it.\n\nClass Context to the rescue!\n---\n\nShachar Shemesh\n\nShachar Shemesh has been programming computers since the 8-bit era, and still finds passion in it today. Shachar's professional career has taken him to security, networking, storage and video streaming.\nOutside his professional career Shachar is... also programming. He has several open source projects to his name, and is lately working on creating his childhood computers, from scratch, on low-cost FPGAs.\nShachar also plays the saxophone.
