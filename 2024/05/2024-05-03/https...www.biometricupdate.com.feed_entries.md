		Microsoft has updated its terms of service to clarify its ban on U.S. police departments from using Azure OpenAI Service for facial recognition.

The <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/cognitive-services/openai/code-of-conduct">update</a>, published on Wednesday, notes that integrations with Azure OpenAI Service must not be used for facial recognition purposes by or for a police department in the country. An earlier version of the terms of service stated that Azure OpenAI Service prohibits identification or verification using media containing people’s faces by any user, including U.S. police.

While the U.S. police will have to deal with a complete ban, other law enforcement agencies around the world may have more options. Accordi

		The bipartisan effort by U.S. lawmakers to clamp down on the Transportation Security Administration (TSA)’s use of <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202404/airport-biometrics-bans-proposed-in-us-state-and-federal-legislation">facial recognition</a> for travel screening is fresh news, but at least one of the senators leading the charge is an old hat when it comes to pushing back against developments in identity technology.

According to ABC News, among those arguing that facial recognition in airports poses “significant threats to our privacy and civil liberties” is Senator Jeff Merkley, D-Ore. – who has been voicing his objection to <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202202/senators-urge-federal-agencies-to-end-use-of-clearview-ai-technology">biometric tec

		Holders of Israeli biometric passports who want to renew them can henceforth do so online, but not every passport user is eligible and no biographical information such as the applicant’s name can be changed.

According to <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/israelis-can-now-renew-biometric-passports-online-from-home-cutting-out-long-waits/">The Times of Israel</a>, the online application can only be lodged from within the country and applicants will have to submit a facial photo which matches the one already held in the database. Holders of biometric national ID cards can also initiate the renewal process which concerns only applicants of between 21 and 60 years of age.

Authorities say passports renewed online will have a validity of five years and not the usual t

		Market research outlet <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/liminal">Liminal</a> has released a report that forecasts rapid growth in the Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM) market, rising from $6.2 billion in 2024 to a projected $10.8 billion by 2028 at a compound annual growth rate of 11.7 percent. The growth is caused by industry changes like vendor consolidation and the demand for more seamless but effective security measures.

One major challenge for the market is fragmented and unreliable identity data, making it difficult to achieve data privacy compliance and producing inconsistent user experiences across different platforms.

Almost half of CIAM businesses are planning major changes to their systems, according to the <a href="https://limi

		A bill to amend America’s most punitive biometric data privacy law is advancing in the Illinois legislature.

As the bill to state that claims under the Biometric Information Privacy Act do not accrue with each individual scan passed from the state Senate to the House, support for it has become a partisan issue. Democrats on the House Judiciary-Civil Committee approved the amendment, and all Republicans voted in opposition, local outlet <a href="https://www.wgem.com/2024/05/02/illinois-house-advances-bill-changing-liability-laws-biometric-data-violations/">WGEM</a> reports.

House sponsor Rep. Ann Williams says the bill will maintain BIPA privacy protections while addressing a prohibitive liability burden, which could see small businesses hit with millions of dollars i
