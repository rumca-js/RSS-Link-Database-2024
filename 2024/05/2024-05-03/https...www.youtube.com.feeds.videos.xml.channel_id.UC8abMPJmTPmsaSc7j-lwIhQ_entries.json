But there's a hidden chapter to this war, a story so bleak it chills the soul \u2013 the story of Germany's child soldiers.\n\nThe untold tragedy of the Hitlerjugend and Volkssturm. Boys barely old enough to shave were indoctrinated, armed, and thrown into the desperate fires of the war's final days. Their innocence was stolen, their childhoods shattered.\n\nThis video isn't just about history; it's a stark reminder of the price of fanaticism, the way war twists and devours the most vulnerable. \n\nBecause even in the darkest corners of history, there are lessons to be learned, and stories that must never be forgotten.\n\n#WWII #ChildSoldiers #History #Documentary #Germany\n\n\nMusic: Mendelssohn, Op.49", "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDJ9n7P_06Q", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC8abMPJmTPmsaSc7j-lwIhQ", "source_obj__id": 241, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/sDJ9n7P_06Q/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "(1945) Hitler's Lost Boys: Child Soldiers of the Third Reich", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
