Today on the Matt Walsh Show, a community in Louisiana is accused of racism after seceding from a crumbling, crime-infested city and forming their own. Is this a solution that could be adopted nationwide? Also, the frat boy uprising continues in response to the leftist protests on college campuses across the country. The Biden Administration seems intent on promoting marijuana usage as much as possible. Why is that? And there has been yet another rash of pit bull attacks. You may think you know my opinion about it. But I might surprise you.

Jeff Goldblum refuses to leave his kids any money when he dies. This philosophy is a trend among boomers that goes against what has historically driven men for centuries.
