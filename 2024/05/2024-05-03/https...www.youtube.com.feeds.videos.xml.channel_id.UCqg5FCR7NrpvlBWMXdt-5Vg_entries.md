In the annals of gaming history, there exists a cherished concept that seems to be slipping away: great pacing. Once upon a time, games were crafted with meticulous care, offering repayable experiences that beckoned players back for more. However, in the modern era, a trend has emerged where games are becoming bloated behemoths, with worlds too vast and filled with repetitive content. The art of creating games with great pacing seems to be fading into obscurity.
