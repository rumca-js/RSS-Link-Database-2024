Big Arm NAS meets tiny Pi NAS. I set up ZFS replication between my two Arm NASes, and completed part of my 3-2-1 backup plan. I'll also talk about other progress in the new studio, and a couple exciting announcements!

HUGE thanks to Kioxia for sending me two of their CD-8 NVMe SSDs for this buildâ€”I'll cover them more on the @Level2Jeff channel soon!
