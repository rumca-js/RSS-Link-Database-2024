<p>As a seasoned advocate and expert in cloud computing and <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3689973/what-is-generative-ai-artificial-intelligence-that-creates.html">generative AI</a>, I’ve observed the immense transformative potential these technologies offer. Yet, we’re doing things just as stupidly as we did in the early days of cloud computing.</p><p>If you have not noticed lately, enterprises are running around in circles to fix mistakes they made 10 years ago in migrating and building new cloud-based systems. Repatriation is shorthand for “whoops!” The lack of planning and understanding has led to huge bills that nobody expected, and CIOs are attempting to mitigate. This means instead of focusing on innovation, we’re looping back to fix things after the fact.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3715327/architecture-by-conference-is-a-really-bad-idea.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></artic

<p>ASP.NET Core offers a simplified hosting model, called minimal APIs, that allows us to build lightweight APIs with minimal dependencies. However, “minimal” doesn’t mean minimal security. Minimal APIs need authentication too.</p><p>We’ve explored <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3669188/how-to-implement-jwt-authentication-in-aspnet-core.html">JWT authentication</a> in an earlier post here. In this article we’ll examine how we can build a basic authentication handler for minimal APIs in ASP.NET Core. Below we’ll implement a basic authentication handler that will identify and authenticate the user. Because we will validate the user’s identity using credentials stored in a database, we will make use of <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3672154/how-to-use-ef-core-as-an-in-memory-database-in-asp-net-core-6.html">Entity Framework Core</a>. </p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3715243/build-an-authentication-handler-for-a-minimal-api
