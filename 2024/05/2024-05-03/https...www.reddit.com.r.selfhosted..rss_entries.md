<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone, </p> <p>I'm new to selhosting so don't hesitate to explain very basic things. </p> <p>First I'll explain my setup: I have an old laptop at home which I use as a server (and will call server after that) and a low-tier VPS. Everything I host is on the server but I can't open port on my home network so I use tailscale to VPN between my vps and server, the former only hosting a nginx reverse proxy pointing to the tailscale IP of my server. </p> <p>With this setup, I wanted to host a callibre using the linuxservers docker image. The calibre in itself work well but I can't manage to make the content server work. Whenever I go to domain/content it won't work and I get &quot;Cannot GET /content&quot;</p> <p>I'll put bellow my config file : </p> <p>-----</p> <p>Calibre.conf : </p> <p>server {</p> <p>listen 80;</p> <p>location /content {</p> <p>proxy_pass <a href="http://100.97.230.69:8080">http://&lt;tailscale-ip&gt;:808</a>1;</p> <p>}</p> <p>loca
