There's something mysterious brewing over at Nintendo; a new listing for a previously unannounced Switch game, called Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition, has been spotted on the US' Entertainment Software Ratings Board (ESRB) website.
</p><p>
Helpfully, the ESRB - which has rated the game 'E' for 'Everyone' if you're curious - has <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/39835/nintendo-world-championships-nes-edition/">a few details</a> on Nintendo's mysterious new title, describing it as a "collection of 2D challenges and platformer games in which players traverse through various modes (e.g., speedrun, survival)".
</p><p>
"Several challenges involve reaching specific points, while others prompt players to defeat small enemies or survive brief battles," the ESRB description continues. "Some games depict pixelated characters using small

Alongside the arrival of the first villainous Legend to hit the games since Revenant in 2020, there are plenty of new and returning additions that promise to turn this season on its head including a revamped Broken Moon and Solos mode returning for a limited run.</p><p>First things first, let's talk about the big addition - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/apex-legends-alter-abilities-explained-9417">a Legend called Alter joining the Apex games at the launch of Upheaval</a>. Alter is a dimensional traveller of the Skirmisher class and the first villain we've seen in a long time. Alter is from another dimension, though which one she's from is a mystery for now (she's not a reliable narrator). If 

## Fallout 4's next-gen upgrade: bugged on Series X/S, disappointing on PS5 and PC

The prospect of native PS5 and Series games is tantalising but unfortunately the update arrives with a number of issues - and even at its best the result is somewhat underwhelming. </p><p>The patch notes mention two main graphics modes on console: a dynamic 4K 60fps performance mode running at 'standard' settings and a 4K 30fps quality mode running at PC's ultra preset. The game itself presents this as a performance mode on/off toggle in reality, where the off setting is effectively the quality mode referred to in the notes. Beyond these two basic options, Bethesda also adds additional modes for those outputting the 

## Why you should play Manor Lords as a cosy game

As a lover of medieval history and swords, I was attracted to Manor Lords from the very first time I heard about it. Manor Lords is a city builder strategy game that has you fostering a thriving medieval village and ushering it into a new dawn filled with trade, farming, and - of course - at least one Manor. After picking it up for myself and getting fully into the medieval ambience thanks to some tavern ambience YouTube videos, I was surprised to find that on peaceful difficulty it could actually be considered a cosy game, just like Stardew Valley and similar farming simulators. Manor Lords also has surprising similarities to Cult of the Lamb, so if you're up for something less cult-like but still with lambs involved in one way or another, look no further. 
</p><p>
Describing Manor Lords as a city builder is an oversimplification. It

The required PC specs for Hellblade 2: Senua's Saga have been revealed and it looks like you'll need a beefy machine to have it running well.
</p><p>
The game is a graphical showcase, but will only run at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hellblade-2-will-be-30fps-only-on-xbox-consoles">30fps on Xbox Series X/S consoles</a>. On PC this can be increased, but you'll need to use DLSS 3, FSR 3, or XESS 1.3 to achieve this.
</p><p>
At the least, all players will require 70GB of SSD storage and 16GB of system RAM.

Today brings Fortnite's biggest Star Wars crossover yet, with new content from the galaxy far, far away in all of the game's four main modes.

Access to play most of this content is free, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-fortnite-adds-big-new-star-wars-world-this-week">Lego Fortnite's major new Star Wars world</a>, but there's also more than &pound;60 of new cosmetic items to splash your cash on, should you fancy.

In terms of skins, there's a new version of Luke Skywalker available featuring his Return of Jedi swamp clothes - and most notably, featuring Yoda as a backpack. The Dagobah Luke bundle includes the Jedi apprentice and wizened Muppet master for 1800 V-Bucks (around a tenner). I feel like this really could have been a new style for the existing Luke skin, es

"The Sonic the Hedgehog fans came out in full-force," said Jeff Grossman, executive vice president, programming, at Paramount+. "We're so thrilled with the record-breaking performance of Knuckles and the incredible lift the whole Sonic universe has experienced following Knuckles' premiere."
