Also in the set list were several songs from Folds‚Äô back catalogue, including a group sing-along among the audience during ‚ÄúYou Don‚Äôt Know Me,‚Äù conducted by Folds as he played and sang his own part. The audience consisted of lucky winners who had entered for a chance to attend this unique performance.

Laamar has been a buzzed-about artist in the scene since performing at First Avenue this past January as part of the Best New Bands of 2023 showcase. And recently, Laamar returned with his band to their biggest stage yet, Palace Theater, to open for one of Minnesota‚Äôs most recognizable names in pop-rock music: Semisonic.

Just after recording an in-studio performance and interview at MPR, his soul-Americana, racial-justice song ‚ÄúSay My Name‚Äù hit no. 2 on The Current‚Äôs Chart Show.

Laamar (born Geoffrey Lamar Wilson) chatted with The Current about being raised by a musician father in North Minneapolis, to now taking on a similar role as a dad of two. Laamar also talked about finding confidence in singing, connecting with the local music scene and more. Watch the performance of "My Kingdom" above.
