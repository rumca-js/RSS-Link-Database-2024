This week he invited the club’s Irish strength and conditioning coach, Eamonn Hyland, to give his players an “incredibly powerful” lesson in the cultural and historic significance of becoming the first English side to play at Croke Park. Players were moved to goosebumps as the size of the challenge that awaits against Leinster on Saturday became all the more acute.</p><p>It is 104 years since the Croke Park massacre, in which 14 spectators were fatally shot by the Royal Irish Constabulary and, as Dowson points out, Croke Park is “a landmark of [Irish] independence”. Having spoken recently with Donncha O’Callaghan, the former Ireland and Munster second-row, Dowson is only too aware that when England played at Croke Park in 2007 the result was “almost a foregone conc

But 50 years on from its heyday, cottage cheese is making a comeback in the UK, and has become an unlikely hit with health-conscious Gen Z.<br /><br />Driven by a wave of social media influencers sharing inventive recipes for the dairy product, which is made from milk curds, UK retailers are reporting significant increases in sales, while producers are struggling to keep up with demand.<br /><br />“It’s come from absolutely nowhere,” said Robert Graham, managing director of Graham’s Family Dairy. “Since May of last year, when there was a TikTok craze that went on,

<p>A Jamaican-style grown-up’s milkshake featuring Guinness, Nurishment and white rum</p><p>If there’s one thing Jamaican people do well, it’s make punch, and this one is sweet, creamy, addictive and easy. It takes me down memory lane – I remember begging my nana to let me have some and always being told no, because of the alcohol. Eventually, though, I got to an age when I was allowed a tiny glass with Sunday dinner. It’s like a Jamaican adult milkshake, but better.</p><p>This is an edited extract from Flayvaful: Spice up your Kitchen, by Nathaniel Smith, published by Murdoch Books at £22.

<p>Think about the silhouette – black makes a caped sleeve or wide-legged trouser feel more wearable</p><p>Wearing all black looks chic. It looks cool. I realise that this has not been breaking fashion news since approximately 1957. And I know I sound really basic for saying it aloud. Still, I think it bears repeating. Because sometimes we can’t see the wood for the trees, and it is useful to be reminded that all black can be a sanity-saving wardrobe formula that can be adapted for any occasion and never lets you down.</p><p>But do you know the best way to wear black? Sounds like a stupid question. The whole vibe of wearing black is about giving off an air of nonchalance. Like, you know, that you were just born super cool, and your outfits just put themselves effortlessly together without you having to try. But that’s not actually how it works. Black is a brilliant canvas, but to make it sing you need to – whisper it – put a tiny bit of effort in. No one ever need know.</p> <a href="h

After team owner James Dolan was handed the Knicks on a silver platter by his Cablevision-founding father in the late 1990s, the Knicks slipped into chaos and degradation. The conspicuous void at the point guard position reflected the lack of leadership on and off the court.

To that canon there is now a new throwaway entry: Hulu’s Prom Dates, a cringeworthy comedy produced by Kevin Hart, which posits that in the year 2024, two seemingly self-possessed girls sincerely believe that having a prom date – any prom date, but especially a cool one – is the single most important thing in the world. That it’s the one reason to stay in a cartoonishly terrible relationship, or go on a fishing expedition in search of passable strangers to drag back for one night in high school.</p><p>This is just one of the many grating elements in Prom Dates, directe

<p>A bureaucrat in near-future London finds love with a Victorian Arctic explorer in a thrilling debut that takes a deep dive into human morality</p><p>For a book to be good – really good, keep it on your shelf for ever good – it has to be two things: <em>fun</em> and <em>a stretch</em>. You have to need to know what happens next; and you have to feel like a bigger or better version of yourself at the end. Airport thrillers are almost always fun; much contemporary autofiction is just a stretch, largely because it’s very hard for a book in which not much happens to be a page-turner. What a thrill, then, to come to Kaliane Bradley’s debut, The Ministry of Time, a novel where things happen, lots of them, and all of them are exciting to read about and interesting to think about.</p><p>Bradley’s book is also serious, it must be said – or, at least, covers serious subjects.

Tissues at the ready! </p><p>Oh, to be in charge at Prime Video. Imagine spending $465m on a Lord of the Rings remake that hardly anyone appeared to actually enjoy, when it turns out that sticking a few cameras on a tractor while a famous curmudgeon tries to explain the impossibilities of farming in Britain today will give you the biggest show on the platform. That is, in the UK, at least. We’ll have none of your explosive charismatic movie star Mr and Mrs Smith remakes, thank you very much. We’ll take bickering with the local council about enforcement orders, novel methods of blackberry harvesting and the travails of breeding pigs at Diddly Squat farm instead.</p><p>Actually, hold that last thought, because I may still regret my emotional investment in the third season of Clarkson’s Farm.

Unfrosted doesn’t quite have the flair of Bee Movie, but there’s a steady stream of excellent gags, creating a rising crescendo of silliness similar in effect to Seinfeld’s own distinctive falsetto-hysterical declamation at the moment of ultimate joke-awareness. There are also nice supporting roles and cameos, including an extra

Still, you might not imagine that “name a New Zealand author” could ever be one of them – especially for a New Zealand politician, holding an arts portfolio.</p><p>Yet that’s exactly how the ACT party’s arts spokesperson, Todd Stephenson, has surprised us, taking 20 minutes to name a single Kiwi author – or even a book – in <a href="https://newsroom.co.nz/2024/04/29/acts-arts-spokesman-once-watched-a-musical/">an interview with Newsroom</a>. In the quite remarkable exchange with Steve Braunias, Stephenson was blithely forthcoming about his limited experience of his portfolio: “It’s an area I’m wanting to learn more about.”</p><p>Elle Hunt is a freelance journalist and writer</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wor
