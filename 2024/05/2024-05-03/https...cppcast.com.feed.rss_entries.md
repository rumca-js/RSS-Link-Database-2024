Niels Lohmann joins Timur and Phil. Niels talks to us about his popular JSON library, JSON for Modern C++ (often just known as nlohmann/json, after its github repo). We chat about the history and purpose of the library, with an interesting aside into starting and maintaining a popular OSS library, as well as what Niels is up to today.
