Lightning Talk: Enhancing C++ exceptions with Context - Shachar Shemesh - CppCon 2023
https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2023

Exceptions in C++ are missing important context. You know something bad happened, and you kinda know what, but you don't have any context on what the program was trying to do, or why it was trying to do it.

Class Context to the rescue!
