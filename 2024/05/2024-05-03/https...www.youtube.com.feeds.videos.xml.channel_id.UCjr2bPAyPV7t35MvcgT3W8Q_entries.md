There is a powerful motivation to keep you thinking that AI is an existential threat. That we should treat it with the same level of urgency as a nuclear war or a global pandemic. 
And yet, we shouldn’t stop developing AI. We should accelerate it as fast as we can. As long as it’s the select few good guys that get to control it. We must not let AI fall into wrong hands. 

But there is a growing opposition to this movement. A conflict is arising. There is those that want to keep AI closed off and tightly controlled and those that want to leave it open and accessible to all. Even though both sides claim they are doing for humanity, only of them is right. This is an arms race for who gets to dominate AI development and who will be left out.
