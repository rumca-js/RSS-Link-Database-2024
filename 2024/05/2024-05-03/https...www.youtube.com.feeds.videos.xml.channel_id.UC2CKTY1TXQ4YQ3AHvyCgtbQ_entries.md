Does the UGLY PHASE in your miniature painting make you want to stop? Did you know ALL painters have an ugly phase?

Vince Venturella and I made a 'zine! Check out SNARL at http://www.reigninhellgame.com

I'm now a partner on Twitch! I paint minis every Friday morning and Monday night, and sometimes take paint breaks (play video games poorly). Follow me: http://www.twitch.tv/tabletopminions
