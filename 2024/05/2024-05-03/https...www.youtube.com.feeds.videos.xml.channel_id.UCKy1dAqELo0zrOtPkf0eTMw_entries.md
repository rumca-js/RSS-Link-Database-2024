In this video, we’ll go over the biggest changes in Survival mode versus the more traditional Fallout experience, and offer some tips on surviving in the desolate, unforgiving wasteland.

In today's Daily Fix:
Helldivers 2 fans are up in arms, but not over the latest major order or weapon nerf—Sony is now going to require PC players to link the game to a PSN account. Don't worry, it's free (it's NOT PS Plus), but it's yet another account you'll need to sign up for if you want to keep squashing bugs and bombing 'bots. In other news, Redfall recently celebrated its one-year anniversary, and by celebrating we mean Microsoft did absolutely nothing to acknowledge that milestone. In fact, there's still no word on the previously-announced DLC. And finally, Nintendo may be adding a classic and highly sought-after game to the Switch. That's right, the Nintendo World Championship—one of gaming's Holy Grails—just might get a special version for the Switch.

## Kevin Feige Told Hugh Jackman Not to Come Back as Wolverine - IGN The Fix: Entertainment

Kevin Feige told Hugh Jackman not to return as Wolverine, but he had a good reason, according to a recent interview with Empire. “I said, ‘Let me give you a piece of advice, Hugh. Don’t come back’. “‘You had the greatest ending in history with Logan. That’s not something we should undo.’” But when Hugh Jackman thought about the potential of being in Deadpool 3, he had to throw the advice out the window not only for the fans, but to put on the tried-and-true yellow and blue suit Logan is known for in the comics. But this was definitely something Jackman had to think about long and hard: “I was about an hour into the drive. And that question came into my head: ‘What do I want to do?’ And as soon as I asked the question, I wanted to do Deadpool & Wolverine. I just knew it. I drove for another hour. Couldn’t stop thinking about it. And I got out of the car, called Ryan, and said, ‘Ryan, if you’ll have me, I’m in.’

Todd Howard is well aware of the criticisms Starfield faced when it launched last year. Starfield is Bethesda's first new IP in years, and had tons of hype built around it leading up to the release, but the game was met with tepid reviews. In other news, dataminers have seemingly found evidence of some major crossovers coming to Call of Duty: expect the likes of Fallout, Gundam, and The Crow to come to the popular shooter franchise soon. And finally, 7-Eleven is getting into the gaming space with a Tetris handheld. And yes the handheld will resemble a Slurpee.
