<p>If you&rsquo;re a PC gamer, you know how expensive it can be. In addition to purchasing your favorite triple-A titles, you also need a powerful machine to run them on.

<p>I find it really hard to recommend any Windows-powered machine these days with less than 16GB of memory. Windows 11, not to mention essentials like Chrome and other browsers, just chug on anything less. So it&rsquo;s great to see <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-laptops/inspiron-15-laptop/spd/inspiron-15-3520-laptop/nn3520gmqdh&amp;xcust=2-1-2322985-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">a dependable 15-inch laptop from Dell going for as little as $359.99</a>, at least if you jump through a hoop or two. </p>



<p>Dell is selling an Inspiron 15, with a 12th-gen Intel Core i5, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB of SSD storage for $399.99, already a <em>very </em>solid $150 off the regular price. But <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://slickdeals.net/f

<p>OLED monitors are the cream of the crop when it comes to gaming, and Samsung makes one of the biggest, widest ones out there. The Odyssey OLED G9 is 49 inches of super-saturated, perfect-black glory, but it doesn&rsquo;t come cheap, with a regular retail price of $1799. But today Amazon is <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CDQMQQS2?th=1&amp;xcust=2-1-2278597-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">offering it at one of the best prices we&rsquo;ve seen yet</a>, just $999.99, matching a low we saw for a few days last month. To get the full discount, be sure to click the coupon button that knocks another $100 off its already-spectacular $1,099 sale price.</p>



<p>In terms of dollars to pixels, it&rsquo;s probably the best deal on <em>any </em>OLED gaming monitor at the moment. The Odyss

<p>For a long time, the battle lines have been drawn around optical and mechanical switches in gaming mice buttons, with optical switches appearing the winner in the tussle.</p>



<p>But now a third category has entered the fray, which blurs the lines between the two switch types even more. So, what are hybrid switches? And how do they compare with the tried-and-true switches we&rsquo;ve been using already?</p>

<p>The fact that IT is such an exciting topic has a lot to do with the constant changes. In hardly any other industry do new technical developments follow each other so closely. Ground-breaking new products are launched on the market in rapid succession and often become widespread very quickly. </p>



<p>However, it often happens that after a few years, competing products emerge that replace their predecessors thanks to having a better concept, a modern interface, greater functionality adapted to current requirements, or simply lower costs. </p>



<p>In this article, we present a series of examples in which programs that were previously regarded as a kind of standard have been replaced by new developments, and explain the background and reasons for the change in each case.</p>
