<p>Every point counts, but this one is unlikely to be enough for Luton Town. When the story of the 2023-24 Premier League season comes to be told, it is likely that they will look back with regret when they remember the night when they failed to find a way past a negative, limited Everton side.</p><p>Of course, nobody inside Kenilworth Road could quibble with the level of Luton’s spirit and desire. There was also a lovely equalising goal from Elijah Adebayo, whose strike cancelled out Dominic Calvert-Lewin’s early opener, and there were periods when Rob Edwards’s team looked capable of breaking Everton down. The pressure was relentless during the second half. Tahith Chong, who never stopped running, was outstanding.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/may/03/elijah-adebayo-strikes-but-frustrated-luton-fail-to-put-everton-away">Continue reading...</a>
