<p>X is using Grok to publish AI-generated summaries of news and other topics that trend on the platform. The feature, which is currently only available to premium subscribers, is called ‚ÄúStories on X,‚Äù according to <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://twitter.com/XEng/status/1786463531505799186"><ins>a post</ins></a> from the company‚Äôs engineering account.</p>
<p>According to X, Grok relies on users‚Äô posts to generate the text snippets. Some seem to be more news-focused, while others are summaries of conversations happening on the platform itself. One user <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://twitter.com/minchoi/status/1786464201646469331"><ins>posted</ins></a> a screenshot that showed stories about Apple‚Äôs earnings report and aid to Ukraine, as well as one for ‚ÄúMusk, Experts Debate National Debt,‚Äù which was a summary of a ‚Äúcandid online discussion‚Äù between Musk and other ‚Äúprominent figures‚Äù on X.</p>

<p>Linking to a random third-party account when you just want to play a video game you paid for is truly annoying and, honestly, keeps me from even launching certain games by certain publishers who shall remain nameless. <em>Helldivers 2 </em>players are experiencing this frustration right now, as the PC version of the massively popular third-person shooter <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/4196868529806518741?l=english"><ins>will soon require a link to a PlayStation account</ins></a>.</p>
<p>New players will be required to link both accounts on May 6, but pre-existing players have until June 4 before the requirement kicks in. Sony says that forcing people to link to a PSN account helps ‚Äúprotect players from griefing and abuse by enabling the banning of players that engage in that type of behavior.‚Äù Ah, the popular ‚Äúfew bad apples‚Äù excuse.</p>

<p>Instagram just announced <a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/new-stickers-for-stories"><ins>some new features coming to Stories</ins></a>, including a suite of interactive stickers. The music one is perhaps the most interesting, as it's an extension of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-add-yours-sticker-rollout-195412390.html"><ins>pre-existing Add Yours feature</ins></a>. The Add Yours Music sticker lets users share their favorite songs, along with a prompt for followers to get in on the fun by sharing their own related tracks. Of course, the song has to already be in Instagram‚Äôs music library to work.</p>
<p>To that end, Instagram has partnered with Dua Lipa to promote her new album, <em>Radical Optimism</em>. Many of the songs from the album are available for use in this way, and the artist herself has been posting Stories with Add Your Music stickers.</p>

When the next season starts, Solos will replace the Duos mode for six weeks.</p>
<p>The game is designed and tuned for squads of three, but Respawn recently told reporters that it &quot;wanted to acknowledge the growing interest in Solos from our players,&quot; many of whom were looking for new ways to play the game. Running the mode for half of season 21 will give the developers a chance to gain plenty of feedback from players. Perhaps that could help them figure out if Solos could become a more per

<p>The Rabbit R1's big selling point has been its &quot;large action model,&quot; or LAM, which can supposedly understand what you say and get things done. But really, that's just marketing speak. At the moment, the R1 can barely do anything as an AI assistant. And the few tasks it can actually accomplish, like placing DoorDash orders, are faster and easie
