As much as I dislike and distrust Axon (formerly Taser and the leading proponent of the &#8220;excited delirium&#8221; theory of cop exoneration), I just don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s much going on here. Sometimes there are actual monopolies. And sometimes, one business is just better at business than its competitors. But that&#8217;s what a few cities are [&#8230;]

Schools have always kept tabs on students using school-issued devices. Prior to the pandemic, this had mostly been limited to filtering software that prevents students from accessing content schools don&#8217;t approve of. Of course, this has also kept students from accessing content that might be useful to them personally (self-harm prevention, LGBTQ+ content) or scholastically [&#8230;]

It’s almost laughable that these two stories happened so close to one another. The Australian government has just announced a pilot program to test an online age verification system: And then, just hours later, it was reported that law enforcement is investigating an apparent breach of club and bar patrons&#8217; personal data, which the venues [&#8230;]
