The world knows the horrors of World War II, the images of devastated cities, and the faces of battle-hardened soldiers. But there's a hidden chapter to this war, a story so bleak it chills the soul â€“ the story of Germany's child soldiers.

The untold tragedy of the Hitlerjugend and Volkssturm. Boys barely old enough to shave were indoctrinated, armed, and thrown into the desperate fires of the war's final days. Their innocence was stolen, their childhoods shattered.

This video isn't just about history; it's a stark reminder of the price of fanaticism, the way war twists and devours the most vulnerable. 

Because even in the darkest corners of history, there are lessons to be learned, and stories that must never be forgotten.
