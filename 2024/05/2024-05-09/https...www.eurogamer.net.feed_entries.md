A Highland Song, the acclaiming hiking adventure from 80 Days and Heaven's Vault developer Inkle Studios, is tempting players back into its rolling Scottish hills with its free new Harmony update, introducing new stories, new music, and more.
</p><p>
A Highland Song, which launched late last year on Switch and PC, tells the story of teenager Moira McKinnon who runs away from her life of relative seclusion on the edge of the Scottish Highlands after receiving a letter from her uncle inviting her to his lighthouse on the coast.
</p><p>
What follows is an often magical blend of gentle narrative and exploratory platforming ("deeply, richly evocative, poetic", is how Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell put it in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-highland-song-review">his four star review</a>) as players guide Moira along one of A Highl

Elite Dangerous studio Frontier Developments has <a href="https://otp.tools.investis.com/clients/uk/frontier_developments_plc/rns/regulatory-story.aspx?cid=1725&amp;newsid=1818095">signed a deal</a> with Universal Products &amp; Experiences to make third Jurassic World title - and it'll be one of three new management games coming from the studio over the next few years.
</p><p>
While Frontier hasn't explicitly referred to the new game as Jurassic World Evolution 3, it seems unlikely it'll be anything else given the studio goes on to note its Jurassic World Evolution series is currently one of the strongest in its portfolio. Jurassic World Evolution 1 &amp; 2 rank first and second respectively in terms revenue generated over their first two years - and that's despite Frontier <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/frontier-j

It looks like the next chapter of Dead by Daylight will be based on Dungeons &amp; Dragons.
</p><p>
Behaviour Interactive, the studio behind the multiplayer horror game, released a teaser trailer for the next chapter today ahead of a full anniversary showcase next week where further details are expected .
</p><p>
While this may seem like a move away from the horror franchises the game is known for, there's presumably plenty of dark fantasy elements that could easily work in the horror setting of Dead by Daylight.

This week, Elite Dangerous - the multiplayer space sim from Frontier Developments - has been met with a spate of negative reviews on Steam, resulting in a recent average rating of 'Mixed'. 
</p><p>
This is all in reaction to the introduction of a new ship known as the Python Mk II. This ship is described as a "sleek" medium class vessel, with a focus on powerful combat. It also promises a smoother ride thanks to its advanced Supercruise Overcharge capabilities. 
</p><p>
So, why the upset? Well, it is because the developer has essentially put this new ship behind a paywall for a few months. "The Python Mk II is available in shipyards for all Odyssey owners on PC from 7 August or you can unlock early access today via the ARX store!" reads the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/359320/Elite_Dangerous/">update post</a>

Nigel Lowrie, co-founder of indie game publisher Devolver, believes in "selling games first" over launching in subscription services like Game Pass and PS Plus.
</p><p>
In an interview with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/devolver-co-founder-says-large-scale-game-dev-crushing-under-its-own-weight-a-little-bit">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, Lowrie provided his stance on the current state of the industry, describing large-scale game development as "crushing under its own weight a little bit".
</p><p>
Further, he noted the growth of subscription services has tapered off and deals for indie developers to be included are getting worse.

With an ever-expanding free trial and plenty of positive buzz, how does the game fare on Microsoft's current-gen consoles ahead of a big graphical update scheduled for July, and what's the score with the recently updated PS5 version? </p><p>Let's start with that relatively more mature PS5 version as the basis for our comparisons, given that the game has been available on Sony's current-gen platform since 2021 - and had some <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2021-final-fantasy-14-the-complete-saga-and-ps5-analysis">baffling performance issues</a> even then.

It's an antique. I can tell that from the limited 2D pixel art. Although it's just a few lines and dots and smudges of light, I can imagine the weight of the receiver in my hands, almost feel that strange matte chill of the Bakelite.</p><p>The telephone is important here in Animal Well. It's how you save the game, for starters. But the more I have explored, making those long looping journeys left, right, up and down, the more I have found myself heading further out in these directions than I had assumed was possible, and the more I worried that I had left the actual game design behind and was moving through a landscape of personalised glitches and oddities? The more I did all this, the more the sight of another telephone came as a sweet relief. A save point,

It all begins with Batman - voiced by the late Kevin Conroy - striding purposefully through an underground cavern-like area as green smoke billows around him. Other MultiVersus characters, such as Bugs Bunny and Arya Stark (I still find the whole line up quite bizarre) are also here, and look a little worse for wear. What, or who, could be doing this?</p><p>Of course, it's The Joker at the root of all this chaos. "Oh Batman, we have got to stop meeting like this," he teases with a laugh, before em

Nintendo Switch owners will no longer be able to upload images and videos directly to social media platform X, formerly Twitter, as of 10th June. 
</p><p>
The removal of posting to X was detailed by Nintendo today, in a <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/65057">blog post</a> on the changes. You'll also no longer be able to find friend suggestions using your X login.
</p><p>
Changes specific to certain games include the ability to post Smash Bros. Ultimate screenshots to the Nintendo Switch Online app's Smash World section, which will become unavailable. Images posted via Splatoon 3's mailbox in Inkopolis square will be sent to Nintendo servers. Posting images to Splatoon 2's mailbox will no longer be possible.

This week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-shuts-slew-of-bethesda-studios-including-redfall-hi-fi-rush-developers">Xbox stunned the industry by announcing it had closed three studios</a>, and repurposed a fourth into another service game support team. This follows the 1900 people laid off across Xbox at the start of this year, and those Xbox employees quietly caught up in the 10,000 layoffs Microsoft made the year before.

Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-shuts-slew-of-bethesda-studios-including-redfall-hi-fi-rush-developers">Microsoft announced the closure of a number of Bethesda studios</a>, including Hi-Fi Rush developer Tango Gameworks. Directed by studio creative director John Johanas, Hi-Fi Rush was lauded for being a smaller, original game that went on to win a BAFTA at last month's awards.
</p><p>
Yet following the closure of Tango, head of Xbox Game Studios Matt Booty told Microsoft employees: "We need smaller games that give us prestige and awards," as per internal remarks shared with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/8/24152137/xbox-hi-fi-rush-tango-gameworks-matt-booty">The Verge</a>.

Arrowhead CEO and Helldivers 2 creative director Johan Pilestedt has said that, at times, the team has "gone too far" when trying to balance the game. 
</p><p>
Pilestedt's comments come in response to one Helldivers 2 player, who said they were no longer finding the game fun due to balance changes. In fact, they felt the game had become "unplayable" with the amount of changes over recent months. 
</p><p>
"Yeah I think we've gone too far in some areas," the CEO subsequently replied, adding he will now talk to the rest of the team about its approach to in-game balancing. "It feels like every time someone finds something fun, the fun is removed," Pilestedt said.

Seven years on from the launch of the first Hellblade game, Ninja Theory's long-awaited Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 launches this month - in just two weeks' time, on 21st May. It's one of only a handful of games from Xbox Game Studios to arrive in 2024 - and yet fans have commented that Microsoft hasn't yet made much of a deal about it. 
</p><p>
The idea that Hellblade 2 might slip out under the radar would be a concerning one, considering the fate that befell Hi-Fi Rush developer Tango Gameworks earlier this week. Despite a positive critical response to its award-winning game, its impact was apparently not enough to save the studio from being <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-shuts-slew-of-bethesda-studios-including-redfall-hi-fi-rush-developers">closed alongside Redfall maker Arkane Austin and others as part of s
