<p>You've got a trip coming up, one that's estimated to be just long enough to enjoy a comic book/graphic novel in. While a trade paperback isn't difficult to carry around, it can be a tad cumbersome, and that's where this new line of "Compact Comics" comes in.

<p>This month's new Mad Max movie, the prequel Furiosa, will feature a cameo from the character Max Rockatansky, but he's not played by his most recent actor, Tom Hardy. Director George Miller told <a href="https://screenrant.com/furiosa-movie-mad-max-cameo-actor-jacob-tomuri/">ScreenRant</a> that Hardy's stunt double from Fury Road, Jacob Tomuri, is stepping in to play the role in Furiosa instead of Hardy.</p><p>"It was Jacob Tomuri, who was Tom Hardy's double. He also did some other stunts. He's a New Zealand stuntman, and he was doing some other stunts on the film, and I thought, 'Who better?' Miller said.</p><p>Hardy's Max was a main character in Fury Road. Furiosa is a prequel that focuses on a younger version of Furiosa, with Anya Taylor-Joy playing the part after Charlize Theron portrayed her in Fury Road. Given that Max only has a small cameo role in Furiosa, it seems likely Max isn't a central part of the story, but it's still cool to know he will show up anyway.</p><a href="

<p>Everyone wants to know when Nintendo is releasing its successor to the Switch, but details are thin on the ground. Recently, some industry observers concluded that Nintendo is unlikely to release the "Switch 2" (as we're calling it) before April at the earliest, because president Shuntaro Furukawa told investors that its current sales forecasts do not include a new console.</p><div><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">I'd be careful reading too much into statements like these.

<p>Orlando Bloom's professional acting career started with a bang, as he landed the role of Legolas in Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings series, a part he's still best known for to this day. Bloom didn't originally audition for Legolas, though. Instead, he first tried out for the role of Faramir.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/Variety/status/1788623718648033327">Speaking to Variety</a>, Bloom said it wasn't until later in the casting process that he became associated with Legolas.</p><p>"I had auditioned to play Faramir. I think they were probably just sifting through London and all the cities around the world to try to find these characters. I guess I probably fit the blurb of Faramir at the time. But then I got a callback to put myself on tape initially for Legolas," he said. "And I got another callback to meet Peter and Fran, who had come to London. And then I waited--I was at drama school. The rest is history."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/orlando-bloom-di

With Batman: The Animated Series co-creator Bruce Timm serving as executive producer, this series is aiming to be a different take on Batman.</p><p>Compared to the 1992-95 animated series, there won't be computers or other high-tech gear for Batman to rely on, as he'll be limited by the technology of the period.

Day One follows characters played by Oscar-winner Lupita Nyong'o and Stranger Things star Joseph Quinn as they experience the day the aliens came to Earth and the trials and turmoil that immediately followed in New York City.</p><p>A Quiet Place: Part II began with an unsettling flashback of the day the aliens came to Earth, but Day One is entirely about the arrival of the evil creatures. For anyone just catching up, the aliens in the A Quiet Place series are blind but have extremely good hearing, prompting people to do whatever they can to stay quiet. In Day One, people are only just learning this, with deadly results.</p><div>          </div><p>Djimon Hounsou, who appeared in A Quiet Place: Part II, also stars in Day One.

<p dir="ltr">It's usually pretty easy to predict how a 2D Metroidvania is going to play out. At some point, you'll probably unlock a double or even triple jump to reach previously inaccessible areas, obtain an air dash that helps you traverse large gaps and pass through specific blockades, and acquire a weapon upgrade that functions as both a killing tool and a way to progress past certain obstacles. Animal Well contains most of these things, but never in ways that are expected. Created by solo developer Billy Basso and published by Bigmode, Animal Well is a surrealist puzzle platformer that's delightfully surprising. Even if its pixelated art style and genre trappings make it seem familiar on the surface, it is a game that often eschews conventional wisdom and stands out because of it.</p><p dir="ltr">You play as a nondescript blob who emerges from a blossoming flower into a strange vibrant world filled with creatures big and small. You can move and jump, but that's about the extent

<p>When Microsoft closed its acquisition of Activision Blizzard last year, some players assumed this meant that the next installment in the Call of Duty franchise would hit Game Pass on day one of its release. But according to a new report, that may not be the case. Per the report, Microsoft has had "internal debates" about whether to put Call of Duty's latest releases on Game Pass. Call of Duty is one of the top-selling video game series in the world, and there is apparently concern that placing the next title on Game Pass will only hurt its revenue stream.</p><p>Per the report from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/8/24151814/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-strategy-changes-arkane-tango">The Verge</a>, Microsoft has considered another increase of the price of Game Pass Ultimate. Since a final decision hasn't been made, "[it] could mean we still see a future Call of Duty release appear in most versions of Game Pass."</p><p>Microsoft placed a large bet on Game Pass to close the gap betw
