		Madison Square Garden Entertainment has succeeded in getting a lawsuit over its use of facial recognition to bar attorneys involved in litigation against it dismissed.

The suit under New York City’s Biometric Identifier Information Code accused MSGE of profiting from the use of the biometric technology, as it acted as a deterrent to litigation against the company.

MSGE deployed facial recognition to identify attorneys with law firms involved in litigation against the venue operator, prompting a <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202301/companys-enemies-list-enforced-with-facial-recognition-prompts-legal-challenge-debate">spat that became public</a> last January.
