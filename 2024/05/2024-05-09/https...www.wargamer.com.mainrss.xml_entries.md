								<p><strong>Catan</strong> is one of the all-time best beginner board games, and utterly essential to any good collection. Snooty tabletop snobs may look down their noses at it, but they're wrong, and we're right. If this strategy classic still isn't on your shelf, you should pick up a copy at the earliest opportunity - lucky for you, then, that we've scoped out a fresh <strong>board game deal</strong> to nab the main game at 27% discount, and some of its best expansions at up to 40% off.</p>

								<p>Dungeons and Dragons has got a lot of competition right now, and it&rsquo;s probably great for fans of the game who were distressed by the OGL incident last year. With lots of new RPG titles presenting a similar experience to the oldest roleplaying game, Wizards of the Coast can&rsquo;t afford to deviate from the straight &hellip; <a href="https://www.wargamer.com/dnd/ogl-competition-honest">Continued</a></p>

								<p>If there&rsquo;s one thing more satisfying than making gribbly little monsters out of play-doh to battle your enemies, it&rsquo;s got to be squishing them flat beneath your thumb when they disappoint you.

								<p>Chittering, chitinous hordes of crawling, leaping, many-fanged, many-clawed monstrosities – <strong>Warhammer 40k Tyranids</strong> are the stuff of nightmares. But surely there's more to their psychological warfare than just a fearsome appearance - just what <em>is</em> it about the 'Nids that inspires true, pure horror in our puny human nerd-brains? I'm Dr Joe, Wargamer's resident psychiatrist, and today we're getting into why your brain makes you so afraid of Tyranids.</p>
