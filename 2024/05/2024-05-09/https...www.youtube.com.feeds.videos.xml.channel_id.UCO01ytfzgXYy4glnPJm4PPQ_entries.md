Today on the Matt Walsh Show, several more public school teachers have been arrested this month for sexually abusing their students. This is part of a massive, decades-long abuse epidemic that has claimed millions of victims; yet, somehow, it still isn't treated as a major scandal. Also, a man in DC fires an AR-15 at a car in the middle of his neighborhood. He's already back on the street. Hunger strikers at Princeton claim it's unfair that their hunger strike has made them hungry. And a liberal punk rock band has put out a cringy song that proves why punk rock is dead.
