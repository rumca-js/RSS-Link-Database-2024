This talk explores usage of the GCC and Clang compiler intrinsic __builtin_constant_p to short-circuit potential substitution failures in the context of writing a state machine.\n---\n\nPatrick Roberts\n\nPatrick is a licensed Professional Engineer with three years of experience developing C++ software for low-latency systems. He enjoys solving complex problems with template metaprogramming techniques acquired while working at Quantlab Financial, and he has a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering from University of Houston.\n---\n\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com\nYouTube Channel Managed by Digital Medium Ltd: https://events.digital-medium.co.uk\n---\n\nRegistration for CppCon: https://cppcon.org/registration/\n\n#cppcon #cppprogramming #cpp", "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hoo9H9z-0VM", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCMlGfpWw-RUdWX_JbLCukXg", "source_obj__id": 420, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/Hoo9H9z-0VM/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Lightning Talk: Detecting Constant Folding to Prevent Substitution Failure - Patrick Roberts  CppCon", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
