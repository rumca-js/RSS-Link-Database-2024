  <p id="In5oqF">Sonos has responded to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/8/24151704/sonos-new-app-bad-reviews-missing-features">the avalanche of feedback</a> — some good, plenty bad — about the company’s redesigned mobile app that was released on May 7th. In the days since, customers have complained about missing features like sleep timers, broken local music library management, and no longer having the ability to edit playlists or the upcoming song queue. More alarmingly, the Sonos app’s <a href="https://mosen.org/sonos2024/">accessibility has also taken a hit</a>, something the company says it’s aiming to resolve by next month. </p>

  <p id="1urNRA">TikTok already automatically applies an “AI-generated” tag to content on its platform made using TikTok’s AI tools, and that same label will now apply to content created on other platforms. Now, TikTok will detect when images or videos are uploaded to its platform containing metadata tags indicating the presence of AI-generated content and says it’s the first social media platform to support <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/10/23911381/adobe-ai-generated-content-symbol-watermark">the new Content Credentials</a>.</p>

  <p id="0yrCnu">Motorola’s Moto G Stylus 5G is back this year with some notable spec bumps and an eye-catching new design. This year’s version gains wireless charging and an upgraded screen, while still holding onto vintage features like a headphone jack and microSD card slot — all for $399.</p>
<p id="B1v4Oz">The G Stylus 5G is still a Big Phone with a capital B: it comes with a 6.7-inch screen. That’s a 1080p panel with up to 120Hz refresh rate, updating last year’s 6.6-inch LCD. There’s a generous 5,000mAh battery, compatible with 30W fast wired charging and 15W wireless charging. The 2024

  <p id="vheN1y">Talk to someone who is fully immersed in the indie game <em>Animal Well,</em> and you’re bound to hear some strange things. They might get excited about a new way to use a Frisbee or be frustrated about playing music for a caged cat. They’ll probably chat your ear off about the dozens of different-colored eggs they’ve collected, and all of the ones that seem just out of reach. Mostly, though, what they’re saying will sound like gibberish. That’s because the world of <em>Animal Well</em> is so odd and cryptic it almost requires its own language to discuss — but once you speak it, it’s hard to think about anything else.</p>

  <p id="eoYA6O">Over the past couple of months, Spotify has been submitting update after update to Apple, changing the interface of its music streaming service to display pricing information in-app for users in the European Union. For users, this is barely worth noticing. But for Spotify, each submission has been yet another skirmish in its yearslong legal struggle with Apple in the EU. And right now, Spotify is the closest it’s ever been to getting Apple to finally cave. </p>

  <p id="EmsO47">WiiM has announced two new audiophile streaming devices for the high end of its wireless audio streaming devices. Called the WiiM Ultra and the WiiM Amp Pro, both support AirPlay 2, Chromecast, DLNA, and several other streaming protocols and will be available this summer. </p>
<p id="nKDyCd">Both devices are equipped with a 32-bit / 384kHz ES9038 Q2M Sabre DAC. (Last year’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/22/23972352/wiim-amp-airplay-2-chromecast-wireless-receiver-vintage-hi-fi">Wiim Amp</a> used an ES9018 Sabre DAC instead). They also use Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3 for wireless connectivity, and they each sport the same shrunken-down Mac Studio look. WiiM says the two devices also automatically tune audio output to the room they’re in.</p>
