<p>Trump’s hush-money trial is, at heart, about the ways powerful men work to prevent women from telling ugly truths</p><p>He seems to have understood it as a business deal. That’s what Stormy Daniels – the former porn star whose account of a sexual encounter with Donald Trump at a celebrity golf tournament in 2006 is at the center of his criminal hush-money trial – told Anderson Cooper in 2018. When Trump summoned Daniels to his hotel room in Lake Tahoe, he suggested that she might come on his television show, Celebrity Apprentice. Then he demanded sex.</p><p>In the law this is called <em>quid pro quo </em>– this for that – an arrangement in which work is offered in exchange for sex. It’s illegal: sex cannot be a condition of employment, or a prerequisite for being considered for a job, under laws that are designed to punish sexual harassment and make workplaces accessible and tolerable for women. But Trump has long had a casual relationship to the law.</p><p>Moira Donegan is a Guard

<p>The comedian Willonious Hatcher’s parody song is a phenomenon in its own right, with artists around the world creating their own versions</p><p>Over the last month, the Drake v Kendrick Lamar rap battle has dominated the discourse in music and culture so completely that even a parody offshoot track about the rap battle has become a hit. BBL Drizzy, a song with Motown-style production and 70s soul album cover, has become a vehicle for anyone to join in on the fun of dissing Drake. The song features a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDhSHS3kpeU">Levi Stubbs</a>-like character braying the lines: “I’m thicker than a snicker / I’m thicker than you, ninja / Don’t act like you don’t know me / These yams deserve a trophy / Baby it ain’t no mystery / Got the best BBL in history”</p><p>“It’s so ridiculous and over the top,” says Willonius Hatcher, the comedian behind the song. “You can’t help but laugh.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/article/2024/may/09/drake-kendri

<p>The former heavyweight and US Olympian has awoken from a coma after saving his parents from a fire that almost took their lives</p><p>“THUD.”</p><p>On 13 March, Mark Coleman’s eyelids jolted open, as his bedframe shook. His 11-month-old rottweiler, Lil’ Hammer, cowered under the bed. Chronic nightmares had plagued Coleman since childhood, but it was his dog who woke him around 3am that morning. Coleman left his childhood bedroom – he was on an overnight stay visiting his parents – for a glass of water.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/may/09/ufc-champion-mark-coleman-survived-alcoholism-then-came-the-house-fire-and-coma">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Our new series on transformative theatrical discoveries begins with the surreal 1986 drama set on a street in Lancashire</p><p>I must have been about 14. Our English teacher had taken us to a library and set us a task. We were to choose any book from the shelves and start reading. I wandered around, went to the toilet a few times, pretended to look for a book. Eventually, my teacher caught me. He glared: why don’t you have a book in your hand like everybody else? I turned to my right and spotted a small section of books that looked much thinner than the rest. Jackpot.</p><p>The first thing that struck me about the thing I had in my hands was how easy it was to read.
