<p>The outgoing manager deserves another WSL title but her replacement will inherit a lot of quality young players</p><p>Many will look at Emma Hayes’s 12 years as Chelsea manager and think her lasting legacy is six – potentially seven – Women’s Super League titles, five FA Cups and two League Cups but for me her impact has been felt far beyond west London. By turning Chelsea into the benchmark for others to follow, she has forced up standards throughout the women’s game.</p><p>People forget that the early years were difficult for Hayes, with Chelsea narrowly avoiding relegation in her first full season, but there was always a clear plan of how to improve. Her spell managing in America at Chicago Red Stars, where I was in the squad, I think was pivotal in her career and shaped what she wanted to do at Chelsea.

Beatson plays on a copy of an 1805 fortepiano that’s capable of a range of colour from harpsichord-like jangle to mellow pianistic smoothness, which he exploits to the full. Buoyed on the top of this, Mullova’s playing, on gut strings, is historically informed but not dogmatically so. She uses vibrato for colour generously, and she throws in the odd inelegant swoop and exaggerated accent to disrupt her otherwise clean, clear sense of line. It’s characterful stuff.</p><p>What stands out is the balance and ease of interplay

Was breaking the club’s transfer record on a striker who had, in all truth, enjoyed just one prolific season with Benfica good business?</p><p>When Núñez misses a big chance – and he has missed 27 of them in the Premier League this season, more than any player other than Erling Haaland – his fee comes to the fore.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/who-scored-blog/article/2024/may/09/josko-gvardiol-manchester-city-pep-guardiola-premier-league">Continue reading...</a>

The players who had just made another European Cup final had sprinted from one goal to the other, throwing themselves to the floor in front of their fans; Carlo Ancelotti had belted out the club’s anthem with its line about history made and history to be made, the coolest cat looking as if he was about to cry this time; and now they were doing a lap of honour. As they did so, Toni Rüdiger briefly ducked out. When he came back, he was carrying a white plastic chair, stolen from a steward.</p><p>They were in front of the north stand at the Santiago Bernabéu, and Rüdiger handed it to David Alaba.

Once towering over the city was Lancaster Moor hospital, formerly the Lancaster county lunatic asylum, which was home to thousands of patients. “People were sent here from all over the place,” she says. “There was a care in the community programme and people settled locally, so you had this real collection of characters – amazing artists who burned themselves out on acid and ended up here. There was one pub they all used to congregate in, a real bunch of outsiders and freaks – and I use that as a term of endearment because that included us.”</p><p>For the best part of 20 years, Ross has been making outsider art in the duo the Lovely Eggs with her husband, David Blackwell.

It is, according to the Oxford Dictionary, either “the protection granted by a state to someone who has left their native country as a political refugee” or “an institution for the care of the mentally ill”. Both definitions play their part in the remarkable and original Tale of Ahmed, written in verse and illustrated by Henry Cockburn. Tale of Ahmed is a fictional account of how a 14-year-old Afghan boy sets out from Kabul, after his father has been killed by a warlord, aiming to seek asylum in Britain. By land and sea, through Iran, Turkey, Greece, Italy and France, Ahmed and an ever-changing crew of fellow refugees experience all the dangers and disappointments of the road, but also the highs of optimism and comradeship.</p><p>Cockbu

<p>Role introduced by Yousaf axed as new first minister says case for Scottish independence best made by creating ‘vibrant economy’ </p><p>John Swinney has axed the post of minister for independence, in a clear signal to Scottish voters that his government is focused on their immediate cost of living concerns before the general election.</p><p>The post, held by Jamie Hepburn, was created by the previous first minister, Humza Yousaf, only a year ago, with the main responsibility of publishing a series of papers on how different aspects of government would operate under Scottish independence. With no referendum imminent, opposition parties criticised the publications as a waste of taxpayers’ money. The thirteenth in the series, on justice in an independent Scotland, was published last month.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/may/09/john-swinney-scraps-scottish-minister-for-independence-focus-economy">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Former police sergeant Charlie Hedges has worked on some of the the country’s most high-profile disappearances, from David Kelly to county lines to grooming gangs. Still, he says, the same mistakes are being made</p><p>Two cases, months apart, brought home to Charlie Hedges just how much police were failing when a person was reported missing. The first landed on his desk in October 1997 with a note from his inspector: “Can you sort this out please, Charlie?”</p><p>At the time, Hedges was a sergeant with Thames Valley police in Bletchley. The case involved a 19-year-old man – Hedges calls him Rob, which is not his real name – who had attended a rave in Milton Keynes and failed to return to the guesthouse where he was staying. As Hedges sorted through the scant paperwork, he could see that the police response had been “a bloody mess”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/article/2024/may/09/it-was-a-bloody-mess-why-are-the-police-still-so-bad-at-finding-missing-people">Co

Maybe not from the off, when you’re just wondering what on earth’s going on, but the performers – three of them, all playing characters called Andrea – have a way of gradually winning you over, mainly with silliness and a sense of us all being in cahoots. Their somewhat gormless appearance helps: moustaches and curly wigs raise a smile.</p><p>The show’s creator, Simone Mousset, is a young Luxembourger choreographer who trained in London. She currently works between the UK, France and Luxembourg, where she is picking up interest in her hard-to-pin-down brand of dance theatre. The Passion of Andrea 2 (an imagined sequel, don’t worry about the backstory) is devised with three very likable performers, Lewys Holt, A de la Fe and Bryn Thomas, who quickly turn from genial to competitive to homicidal, short-circuiting

<p>While Europe’s lingua franca remains dominant, there has been a definite shift since a Portuguese song triumphed in 2017</p><p>There was a time when in order to win Eurovision you had to “fly on the wings of love”, “take me to your heaven” or “sail into infinity while reaching for divinity”. This year, however, there’s a fair chance the winner will <em>estar comiendo el mundo (</em>be eating the world), <em>ridere in queste notti bruciate </em>(laugh in these burnt nights)<em>, </em>or even <em>drukkje min broderѕ blod </em>(drink my brother’s blood)<em>.</em></p><p>The metaphors may have been mixed, but for the first two decades of the 21st century, the English language reigned supreme at the Eurovision song contest. In the run-up to the millennium, the so-called language rule restricted English songs to countries that counted it among their official languages, such as Britain, Ireland and Malta. But when the rule was scrapped in 1999, the floodgates opened.</p> <a href="https://w

<p>How presidential animosity and diplomatic failures by China and the US have left the island in a perilous state</p><p>As flashpoints go, few come flashier than Taiwan. To pick one incident from a string of recent close calls: the visit of Nancy Pelosi to Taipei in the summer of 2022. Pelosi, then speaker of the House and third in line to the presidency, was travelling to Taiwan to make an “unequivocal statement that America stands with Taiwan”. The visit produced predictable fury in Beijing: it was “manic, irresponsible and highly irrational”, according to officials; Pelosi was “playing with fire”. Troops were placed on high alert; military exercises were ordered; missiles were launched into the Taiwan Strait. The editor of one mainland tabloid<em> </em>even<em> </em>called for Pelosi’s plane to be shot down. But the more Beijing threatened, the more determined the speaker became, and so, for a few days that August, the world’s two largest economies stood one small military acciden

Take the reputations of Beryl Cook (1926-2008) and Touko Laaksonen, better known as Tom of Finland (1920-1991). Both spent most of their careers having their work either ignored or actively disdained by the establishment: Cook cast as purveyor of saucy seaside postcards in oil, Tom as homoerotic cartoonist. Then, later in life and having already attracted significant followings outside the gallery and museum systems, they were eventually granted some sort of official approval.</p><p>“But they have far more in common than just career trajectories,” says Joe Scotland, director of Studio Voltaire in London and co-curator of a new joint exhibition. “In formal terms they both articulate the human figure in very distinctiv

<p>Obnoxious flatmates Ewan McGregor, Christopher Eccleston and Kerry Fox get way more than they bargained for with the arrival of enigmatic Keith Allen and a suitcase full of cash</p><p>Rereleased for its 30th anniversary, the macabre black-comic crime caper is from screenwriter John Hodge with Danny Boyle making his feature-directing debut, giving us a hint of the turbocharged showmanship that always marked his style and which he was to crank up another notch a few years later with the zeitgeisty 90s hit Trainspotting. Shallow Grave is a bizarre Edinburgh noir, centring on cover-ups, disloyalty and incompetent corpse-management in the approximate spirit of Ealing, with touches of Hitchcock’s The Trouble With Harry and Orton’s Entertaining Mr Sloane. It’s also a kind of 90s young person flatshare entertainment, but closer to the BBC’s This Life than Friends.</p><p>We get an embarrassment of riches in the cast, with Peter Mullan, Ken Stott and Gary Lewis in small roles.

<p>Mostly traffic-free and flat, this route between Yatton and Cheddar takes in old stations and views across the Levels to the Bristol Channel – and it’s being extended to form part of the 76-mile Somerset Circle</p><p>It’s a noise the former railway tunnel probably hadn’t heard in a while. Somewhere in the dark is a hooting part-owl, part-forlorn steam train. My sister Ele has stopped on her bike to blow determinedly across her cupped hands like a flute. As she recreates this long-gone sound, I pedal on through the cool, damp air. Water drips steadily from the stalactite-coated brickwork as my front light illuminates pedestrians and their dogs looming from the echoing shadows.</p><p>We are cycling the <a href="https://www.sustrans.org.uk/find-a-route-on-the-national-cycle-network/strawberry-line">Strawberry Line</a>, a 10.75-mile, mostly off-road cycling and walking route from Yatton to Cheddar in north Somerset, on a sunny spring morning.

<p>The 1949 Basic Law is a source of national pride – but is it still enough to protect the country from the rise of populism? </p><p>Germany’s democracy is 75 years old this month. The anniversary is pregnant with meaning, as the country debates with ever greater anxiety the principles that have underpinned its postwar identity and sense of self-worth.</p><p>Pomp is not something modern Germans do, but on 23 May <a href="https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html">the Basic Law</a> will be celebrated with a state ceremony. That will be followed by a “Festival of Democracy” in Berlin and in the former capital, Bonn, where it came into being in 1949. Commemorative events and discussion groups are taking place in universities and civic halls. If only other countries, not least Britain, with its politics-as-entertainment culture, could interrogate their democratic credentials as earnestly.</p><p>John Kampfner is the author of In Search of Berlin, Blair’s Wars and Why
