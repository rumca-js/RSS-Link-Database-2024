Zack Snyder has been given rull reign by Netlix to do whatever he wants to do, and apparently what that is, is kinda Star Wars but with a lot more farming?

Rebel Moon - Part Two: The Scargive rdefinitely raises some questions. Like how long would this movie be at normal speed? Why is there so much farming and so little character development? Why does she have a nickname that implies her enemies always survive her attacks?
