Also, a man in DC fires an AR-15 at a car in the middle of his neighborhood. He's already back on the street.

And a liberal punk rock band has put out a cringy song that proves why punk rock is dead. \n\nTIMESTAMPS:\n\n00:00 - 00:30 Opening\n01:52 - 19:39 The Public School System Is Covering Up A Massive Sex Abuse Scandal\n20:45 - 28:33 18 Year-Old-Fires AR-15 Into D.C.
