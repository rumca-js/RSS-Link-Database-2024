Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes reviewed by Eric Goldman. In theaters May 10, 2024.
Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes isn't as emotionally complex as Dawn of the Planet of the Apes or War for the Planet of the Apes, and isn’t attempting to punch you in the gut like those films do. But as this series enters its post-Caesar, Disney-owned era, Planet of the Apes is still on remarkably solid footing. Advancing the timeline is a smart move, allowing director Wes Ball to depict a dramatically changed world while screenwriter Josh Friedman shifts gears into an appealing adventure mode. This is a different Planet of the Apes, but it still feels like it fits in with what came before.

In today's Daily Fix:
Warner Bros. Discovery has revealed it took a $200 million hit in its Q1 financials, and Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League is likely to blame. WBD compared the results to last year's Hogwarts Legacy, and found that Suicide Squad "generated significantly lower revenues." Hogwarts Legacy was last year's best-selling game and a huge critical and commercial hit for WBD. In other news, Matt Booty, the head of Xbox Game Studios, reportedly told staff the company wanted "smaller games that give prestige and awards"...right after they shut down Hi-Fi Rush developer Tango Gameworks. Hi-Fi Rush was a highly-praised game with a smaller budget compared to Bethesda's disastrous Redfall. Tango, Redfall developer Arkane Austin, and a few other studios were shuttered this week by Xbox. And finally, in some good news, Capcom is reportedly making more money than it ever has before, thanks to games like Street Fighter 6, Dragon's Dogma 2, and Resident Evil 4. The money is expe

Fallout 76 reviewed by Travis Northup on Xbox Series X|S. Also available on Xbox One, PC, and PlayStation.

Fallout 76 has come a long way since 2018, transforming into something that’s much closer to the original “Fallout with Friends” pitch that was so enticing about it. The combat, exploration, and RPG systems all feel so good that it’s easy to lose dozens of hours running around the massive map getting lost in over-the-top action. That said, this wasteland still has plenty of room to grow, as its added Expeditions are less interesting than I’d hoped for, the endgame is still a bit thin, and the inventory system seems designed to infuriate – or worse, twist your arm into paying for a real-money subscription to ease the pain. Even still, I never thought I’d return to Appalachia after my initially harrowing experience with it, but Bethesda has really put in the wrench time on this one, and I’m so glad I gave it another shot.

Learn why the Planet of the Apes movies can't ever connect to the classic movies as we explain the sprawling Planet of the Apes timeline. Every time we get a trailer for a new Planet of the Apes movie, people wonder just where the latest film in the venerable series takes place in the Apes timeline. From the Andy Serkis trilogy to the original movies to various other offshoots, this is a franchise that spans thousands of years. And not just that, but it also takes place over a variety of timelines.

Basically, the chronology of the Planet of the Apes movies is a total mess, totally crazy, but also – and this is the most important part – totally awesome. So with the latest film in the series, Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes, now here, let’s board the spaceship Icarus and blast off as we try to explain… the mixed-up, crazy Planet of the Apes movies timeline.

Watch our Animal Well review! Reviewed by Rebekah Valentine on Switch and PC, also available on PlayStation 5.

Animal Well is a veritable feast of brain teasers that’s far more concerned with twisting your mind into knots than any grueling platforming challenges. It’s lovely to look at thanks to gorgeous pixel art and dynamic lighting, and an excellent use of haptics and well-tuned physics systems make it fun to touch, too. The steadily unlocked toybox of tools thoroughly rewards play, curiosity, and experimentation for hours upon hours after the credits roll. Though that late-game maze of mind-teasers might grate once in a while if you’re reluctant to ask for help, the massive onion of Animal Well’s secrets remains dense, clever, and thrilling even when you’ve peeled back as many layers as you think you possibly can… and then peeled a few more beyond that.

Little Kitty, Big City reviewed by Imran Khan on PC, also available on Xbox and Switch.

Little Kitty, Big City is an undeniably cozy and mechanically minimal game tailor-made for cat lovers. Its small but inviting sandbox can provide a few hours of ticking objectives off a list before any repetition sets in, allowing this feline adventure to stretch its exploratory legs before wearing out its welcome. Its graphics are cute and delightful, especially for people who just like to watch their pets leap into boxes or trot along when they realize they are not supposed to be in the kitchen. What’s missing are a few layers of polish on its movement and camera controls, which can make climbing around this city more frustrating than it needs to be. And while the campaign may be brief, being a street-level cat discovering the world a few blocks at a time easily holds up across it.

Sony made the decision to walk back its idea of making Helldivers 2 PC Steam players linking a PSN account to continue to play, and it was definitely a good idea to do so. In this Beyond podcast clip, Max, Brian and Akeem discuss the backlash Sony received when it announced that #Helldivers2 on PC would be forced to link a PlayStation Network account in order to keep playing a video game they’ve enjoyed playing for several months. Why would anyone at Sony think this would be a good idea?
Apparently, the controversial decision to re-enable PSN accounts linking with Helldivers 2 on Steam was done for player’s ‘safety and security’. In a statement, Sony said, “Account linking plays a critical role in protecting our players and upholding the values of safety and security provided on PlayStation and PlayStation Studios games. This is our main way to protect players from griefing and abuse by enabling the banning of players that engage in that type of behavior. It also allows those players
