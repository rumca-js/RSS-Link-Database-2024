Hello, everyone! Welcome to China Insights. I am Sean Lin.
In this episode, we would like to cover two topics:  the first one-- The latest U.S. intelligence indicates that Putin may directly involved in Xi Jinping's war against Taiwan. This would surely put the U.S. at risk of engaging in wars on two fronts with two nuclear powers. But, how likely will this happen? The second topic is about the protests that swept across U.S. campuses in the last couple of weeks.  Some people have compared it to the Chinese Cultural Revolution in the 1960s.  The Chinese lady who were arrested in UCLA is clearly an Asian. Is she a Chinese, a CCP member? Who are the masterminds behind this?
Let's go over some details and see what's going on.
