<p>Apple has reportedly apologized for its tone-deaf “Crush!” ad that sparked a furious backlash with artists, musicians and other creators. <em>AdAge</em> reports that <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://adage.com/article/digital-marketing-ad-tech-news/apple-apologizes-ipad-pro-crushed-ad-it-missed-mark/2559321">Apple said the video</a> “missed the mark” and has scrapped plans to run the cutesy-turned-cringey commercial on TV.</p>
<p>It’s clear that Apple intended for the ad to serve as a metaphor for all the myriad creative tools one has when they throw down <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ipad-pro-m4-hands-on-absurdly-thin-and-light-but-the-screen-steals-the-show-153641259.html">$1,000 or more for a new iPad Pro</a>.

<p>As one of Engadget’s resident mobile geeks, I’ve reviewed dozens of midrange phones and have found that a great smartphone doesn’t have to cost a fortune. Years of commoditization have brought features once exclusive to high-end devices – including big batteries, multi-camera arrays and high refresh rate displays – down to their more affordable siblings. While there are still some things you'll only find on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-smartphones-140004900.html">flagship smartphones</a>, you don't have to compromise as much anymore if you're looking to find the best buy at a lower price point. If you have less than $600 to spend, I can help you figure out what features to prioritize when trying to find the best midrange smartphone.<br /><br /><strong>Editor’s note (5/9/24)</strong>: Google has announced the Pixel 8a, its latest midrange smartphone. The 6.1-inch handset starts at $499 and, as expected, takes many of its cues from last year’s <a href="https://www.engadget.

<p>Netflix and Roblox have teamed up for a digital theme park with activities pulled from the streamer’s many popular franchises. Netflix Nextworld is an area within Roblox that’s currently in early access. The company says the experience is “all about bringing fans to the entertainment they love.”</p>
<p>To that end, Nextworld features activities based on <em>Stranger Things</em>, <em>One Piece</em>, <em>Cobra Kai</em> and even those Zack Snyder <em>Rebel Moon</em> movies <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rebel-moon-part-2-review-a-slow-mo-sci-fi-slog-195505911.html"><ins>that people seem to hate</ins></a>.

<p>Peter Jackson’s <em>Lord of the Rings</em> film trilogy came out right around the time movie studios decided everything needed to be a big franchise that exists in perpetuity. From that perspective, it’s a little surprising that Warner Bros. Discovery hasn’t milked Tolkien’s work more than they already have. That’ll change soon, though, as the company just announced that there are two new Lord of the Rings films in the works (you can read the full press release <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.theonering.net/torwp/2024/05/09/117942-andy-serkis-to-make-hunt-for-gollum-movie/">here</a>).</p>
<p>The first is tentatively titled <em>Lord of the Rings: The Hunt for Gollum, </em>and it’s being directed by Andy Serkis — you may remember him for his landmark performance as Gollum in Jackson’s prior movies. The fact that Serkis is on board, and working from a script by Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens (who co-wrote the prior Middle-earth movies along with Jackson) has me feeling

The latest pushback comes from IbisPaint, which has announced an <a href="https://ibispaint.com/lecture/index.jsp?no=192&amp;lang=en">AI Disturbance tool</a> that interferes with AI image generation.

But while it's smart to be aware of those systems, there are far more important things to consider beyond AI-savviness. It turns out buying a computer in 2024 isn't really that much different than in recent years: You'll still want to find a system that balances power, weight and screen size with your computing needs.<br /><br />Out of the 14 notebooks we've reviewed in 2024, we consider Apple's 13-inch MacBook Air M3 to be the best laptop for most people. It's powerful enough to handle most tasks (even light video editing); it has a great screen and built-in speakers; and its battery could last around 20 hours (depending on what you're doing, of course). The MacBook Air M3 is also one of the lightest and thinnest systems we've reviewed, and it's dead silent, thanks to a fanless design.<br /><br />As for Windows laptops and Chromebooks, the recommendations are a bit mor

<p>TikTok is ramping up its efforts to automatically label AI-generated content in its app, even when it was created with third-party tools. The company <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/partnering-with-our-industry-to-advance-ai-transparency-and-literacy">announced plans</a> to support content credentials, a kind of <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/can-digital-watermarking-protect-us-from-generative-ai-184542396.html"><ins>digital watermark</ins></a> that indicates the use of generative AI.</p>
<p>TikTok’s rules already require creators <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-now-lets-creators-label-ai-generated-content-154536858.html"><ins>to disclose</ins></a> “realistic” AI-generated content.

<p>Earlier this week, Apple introduced a new top-end stylus, the<a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-pencil-pro-adds-squeeze-roll-and-haptic-feedback-to-its-bag-of-tricks-144712885.html"> Pencil Pro</a>, but didn’t discontinue any older model. That means there are now four styluses to choose from, channeling the<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-03-22-apples-messy-ipad-lineup.html"> chaotic lineup energy</a> of Apple Watch and iPad families over the years. Because not every Pencil works with every iPad, we <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-apple-pencil-lineup-is-a-mess-so-heres-a-guide-to-which-one-you-should-buy-190040913.html">explain the best choices</a>.</p>

<p>Netflix has <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/five-new-games-join-netflix-in-may">added</a> Sonic Mania Plus to its roster of games subscribers can access for free on mobile without ads or in-app purchases. The company first <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflixs-2024-game-lineup-includes-game-dev-tycoon-sonic-mania-and-a-cozy-grove-sequel-160014745.html">announced</a> that it was going to add the title to its lineup, along with <em>Game Dev Tycoon</em>, back in December 2023. <em>Sonic Mania Plus</em> was developed for the franchise's 25th anniversary by fans known for their Sonic fangame creations and for their work in the ROM hacking community. It is frequently cited as one of the best Sonic games of all time ever since the original version was released in 2017. <em>Sonic Mania Plus</em>, which came out in 2018, includes additional content. Netflix says the version in its library will come with new levels and bosses, as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One of the best things about the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-android-phone-130030805.html">Android ecosystem</a> is the availability of truly affordable phones for as little as $150. By comparison, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/iphone-se-3-2022-review-battery-life-camera-sample-touch-id-home-button-130047678-130047247.html">cheapest iPhone</a> is based on a dated design and starts at $429. However, picking the right one can be a bit tricky, as reducing the price of a phone can sometimes result in too many trade-offs. So to give you a hand, we tested a bunch of the most popular options and put together a list of our favorite cheap Android phones.<br /><br /><strong>Editor’s note (5/9/24)</strong>: Google has announced the Pixel 8a, its latest midrange smartphone. The 6.1-inch handset starts at $499 and, as expected, takes many of its cues from last year’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/pixel-8-and-pixel-8-pro-review-googles-most-compelling-phones-in-years-specs

<p>Disney has expanded its partnership with Warner Bros. Discovery to offer a streaming bundle sometime this summer. The companies have <a href="https://press.disneyplus.com/disney-entertainment-and-warner-bros-discovery-announce-disney-plus-hulu-max-bundle">announced</a> that they'll soon give people the option to pay for Disney+, Hulu and Max subscriptions together in the US. Hulu on Disney+ <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hulu-on-disney-officially-launches-bringing-together-mickey-mouse-and-the-handmaids-tale-152114434.html">recently came out of beta</a>, a few months after Disney took full ownership of the former late last year. An ad-free bundle with the two services costs $20, while a Max subscription without ads costs $16 a month. An offering with all three will most likely be cheaper than $36, and viewers will have the option to get their ad-supported versions if they want to pay even less.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You might have an idea of which smartphone you want to buy next. But there are more options than ever before that are solid — plenty of companies are making stellar handsets nowadays, at similar prices, all with comparable feature sets. That said, the choice isn’t always cut-and-dry. If you know you want an iPhone, your decision-making process is a bit easier. If you’re an Android person, you have even more options to choose from and more questions to answer before you spend any money. At Engadget, we review phones regularly and have tested dozens over the years; so far for 2024, our top picks remain the same as they were last year, with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/iphone-15-pro-max-review-apple-makes-a-strong-case-for-its-biggest-phone-130018980.html">Apple's iPhone 15 Pro</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/pixel-8-and-pixel-8-pro-review-googles-most-compelling-phones-in-years-specs-price-170022742.html">Google's Pixel 8</a> handsets sitting at the top of the list.
