<p>Mandatory return-to-office policies appear to be pushing workers at major tech companies away from their employers, with measurable effects on how willing people are to stay at companies that require in-person attendance.</p>



<p>A study released this week by researchers at the University of Michigan and University of Chicago found that three large US tech companies — Microsoft, Apple and SpaceX — saw substantially increased attrition, particularly of their more senior personnel, when they <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/1611739/women-high-performers-and-millennials-flee-return-to-office-policies.html">implemented strict return-to-work policies</a> in the wake of the COVID-19 pa

<p>For years now, Apple has been as much a marketing company as a technology company. But after <a href="https://twitter.com/tim_cook/status/1787864325258162239" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Apple CEO Tim Cook introduced the iPad Pro ad</a> this week, you have to ask whether Apple has lost its marketing mojo. </p>



<p>The ad features — if that’s the right word — musical instruments, artist tools, toys, and games being crushed by a huge hydraulic press and turned into a new iPad. All this happens to the musical background of Sonny and Cher’s 1971 hit, <em>All I Ever Need Is You</em>. </p>



<p>Ah, no, Apple, we need far more than just you.</p>

<p>In a bid to improve accountability and transparency in AI development, OpenAI has released a preliminary draft of “Model Spec.” This first-of-its-kind document outlines the principles guiding model behavior in its <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3269878/what-is-an-api-application-programming-interfaces-explained.html">API</a> and <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/1618252/how-enterprises-can-use-chatgpt-and-gpt-3.html">ChatGPT</a>, OpenAI announced in a <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-the-model-spec/">blog post.</a></p>

<p>The many IT risks associated with Shadow IT — and especially Shadow AI and Shadow IoT — are well-known and understandably well-feared. But there is a new form of Shadow IT on the horizon: “Sneaky IT.” </p>



<p>Shadow IT  involves an end-user who bypasses IT and the enterprise security people and whips out a payment card to secure services elsewhere. That delivers a variety of unknown threats into the enterprise environment. But what happens when a trusted vendor adds new elements to its service — especially if it’s SaaS — and never mentions it? That poses a similar risk, both of which relate to environment visibility or, in the case of Sneaky IT, the absence of visibility. </p>

<p>Building and maintaining a diverse workforce <a href="https://www.cio.com/article/189194/5-ways-diversity-and-inclusion-help-teams-perform-better.html" target="_blank">improves organizations in myriad ways</a>, including fostering innovation, enhancing problem-solving capabilities, attracting top talent, building customer understanding, and contributing to social responsibility. Doing so typically requires that companies adopt a comprehensive diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) strategy to not only hire workers from diverse backgrounds, but also provide an environment in which these workers want to stay.</p>

<p>Microsoft’s licensing of its software and services in the cloud is getting it into more hot water in Europe. This time it’s a group of Spanish startups that has called on regulators to investigate Microsoft behavior in the cloud marketplace.</p>



<p>The complaint, from La Asociación Española de Startups (AES) to the Spanish National Markets and Competition Commission (<a href="https://www.cnmc.es/en/sobre-la-cnmc/que-es-la-cnmc">CNMC</a>), accuses Microsoft of “anti-competitive practices” in the cloud marketplace.</p>



<p>The restrictive practices in the cloud marketplace are affecting both suppliers and cloud customers within the startup ecosystem in Spain, the association said.</p>
