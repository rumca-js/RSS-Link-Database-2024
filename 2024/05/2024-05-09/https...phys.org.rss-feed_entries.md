When shopping, have you considered the social and environmental impacts of your vegetable oil purchases? Most products offer limited information on these effects. Labels like "No Palm Oil"—linked to environmental damage and threats to orangutans—or "Fair-trade" are familiar, but many ingredients go unmentioned. How reliable are these claims, and what unseen impacts are we responsible for with our choices?

China low activation martensitic (CLAM) steel, as a typical reduced activation ferritic/martensitic steel, is the main candidate structural material for fusion reactors due to its low activation, high mechanical properties, irradiation resistance and corrosion resistance. However, weld uniformity is difficult to achieve with a conventional welding method, which tends to coarsen the martensitic slat, and the performance of the joints is usually lower than that of the base material.

Across much of the United States, spring is in full force. With warmer weather, people are taking their furry family members out on longer walks and spending more time outside. Alongside blooming flowers and trees, your pet might run into a small, unassuming grass seed pod known as a foxtail. Despite the cute name, foxtails can pose a major threat to your pet's health.

If you have walked on a dune surface after windy conditions have settled, you may have been privileged to recognize one of Nature's wonders: scratch circles. These are structures formed when the end of a tethered object is passively rotated into the surrounding sediment. In other words, a flimsy frond or blade of grass that is attached to the ground will blow in the wind, and its loose end will inscribe a perfect circle or perfect arc, with the point at which it is attached becoming the center of the circle or arc.

Silent discos started back in the 1970s as a convenient way to get around noise restrictions. In those days that meant everyone bringing their own music loaded onto a Walkman. Later, DJs would set up their own radio channels to allow everyone to listen to the same playlist. These events gained popularity in the early 2000s, when music festivals began to host silent gigs with lots of artists streaming on different channels.

From a flaky skull, found "as flat as a pizza" on a cave floor in northern Iraq, the face of a 75,000-year-old Neanderthal woman named "Shanidar Z" has been reconstructed. With her calm and considered expression, Shanidar Z looks like a thoughtful, approachable, even kindly middle-aged woman. She is a far cry from the snarling, animalistic stereotype of the Neanderthal first created in 1908 after the discovery of the "old man of La Chapelle."

Due to the high transparency of cells, it is very difficult to observe the organelles within them. Biologists can label specific organelles for observation through fluorescence staining. This is somewhat analogous to being in an environment without light where everyone is dressed entirely in black, making it difficult to find your friends. By having our friends hold a fluorescent stick, we can easily locate them.
