However, today, I have noticed that whenever I send share links to other people to access files, they are not able to get past 1Gb in download. There appears to be a network error in the browser. I have tested on my end, and I get it as well.<br /> It leads me to believe that there is a server settings issue. Could someone point me to which one it may be? In case it matters, I am using Seafile in a Docker container, behind NPM (Nginx Proxy Manager), which is also in a Docker container.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/sober_programmer\"> /u/sober_programmer </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1cnuz9k/seafile_download_via_link_stops_at_1gb/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1cnuz9k/seafile_download_via_link_stops_at_1gb/\">[comments]</a></span>", "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1cnuz9k/seafile_download_via_link_stops_at_1gb", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/.rss", "source_obj__id": 450, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Seafile Download Via Link Stops at 1Gb", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-05-09T10:36:28+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I have couple of CM4 RPis connected into a k3s cluster.
