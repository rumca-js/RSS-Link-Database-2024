It doesn’t matter if a relationship has gone up in smoke, you have to pay what you owe. A gangster-rapping Italian uncle paid his niece to get him marijuana, but she never delivered. Watch Judge Walsh sort through the weeds of this case.

Today on the Matt Walsh Show, an actor in Los Angeles is killed after he catches someone stealing the catalytic converter from his car. Now, a friend of the victim is speaking out, declaring that the solution to these violent crimes is to "come together" and "love each other." But that is not the solution–in fact, that attitude is a big part of the problem. Also, Chelsea Handler speaks out about the Harrison Butker controversy. She always has great insight to offer and this is no exception. And, a new report finds that teens and young adults today have little to no interest in getting their driver's licenses. That makes us all safer on the roads, but is it really a positive trend?
