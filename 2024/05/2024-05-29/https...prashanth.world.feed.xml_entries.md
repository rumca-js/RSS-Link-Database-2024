I got LLaVA to run on iOS by re-running training using TinyLlama the base model and llama.cpp for inference. The UI is janky, but I learned a lot getting it to run on device. While there are a lot of projects that run various LLMs on mobile, I think there are only a few that allow images as an input (and I think there werenâ€™t any when I started on this project). Check it out on GitHub. A huge shout out to the author of the llava example in the llama.cpp project, as well as the author of the llama.swiftui (and of course, llama.cpp in general).
