<p>Last week, Sony published a seemingly innocuous bit of fluff, touting its long-term "creative entertainment vision" in broad terms, along with some interviews of key employees. Neil Druckmann, studio head of Sony's Naughty Dog, was one of those — and his interview made waves in the game world. According to the interview, Druckmann said AI could "create nuanced dialogues and characters" and also said that the new game Naughty Dog was developing (but hasn't officially announced) "could redefine mainstream perceptions of gaming." Some mighty strong and potentially controversial statements from the head of a studio beloved for its The Last of Us and Uncharted franchises.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Problem is, Druckmann was wildly misquoted by his own employers. A few days after Sony published its interview, Druckmann took to X and said "this is not quite what I said." He then went full Ellie-in-revenge-mode on Sony, posting a section of the original interview transcript. (He was actually pretty poli

<p>Framework, the company known for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/framework-laptop-16-review-modular-wonder-mediocre-gaming-laptop-150026910.html">making unique modular laptops</a>, just announced the latest iteration of its Laptop 13. The big news here is that these computers now come equipped with Intel Core Ultra Series 1 processors, which should offer a serious boost in power along with improved efficiency and battery life. These processors also support up to 96GB of DDR5 RAM, so you can make sure your model is relatively future-proof.</p>
<p>A laptop isn’t just a processor, however, so the Laptop 13 features all kinds of iterative <a href="https://www.engadget.com/framework-brings-amd-mainboards-to-its-13-inch-laptop-140050567.html">improvements over previous models</a>.

<p>Meta caught an Israeli marketing firm using fake Facebook accounts to run an influence campaign on its platform, the company said in its latest report on coordinated inauthentic behavior. The scheme targeted people in the US and Canada and posted about the Israel-Hamas war.</p>
<p>In all, Meta’s researchers uncovered 510 Facebook accounts, 11 pages, 32 Instagram accounts and one group that were tied to the effort, including fake and previously hacked accounts. The accounts posed as “Jewish students, African Americans and ‘concerned’ citizens” and shared posts that praised Israel’s military actions and criticized the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) and college protests. They also shared Islamaophobic comments in Canada, saying that “radical Islam poses a threat to liberal values in Canada.”</p>

<p>Google is crossing genres with its latest wearable for kids, combining a gaming system and an activity tracker in the Fitbit Ace LTE. The company is pitching this as a “first-of-its-kind connected smartwatch that transforms exercise into play and safely helps kids lead more active, independent lives.” Basically, think of it as a Nintendo Switch pared down into an activity tracker for children aged 7 and up, with a few safety and connectivity features built in.</p>
<p>The main idea here is to get kids up and moving, in exchange for progress on the Ace LTE’s onboard games. But there are also basic tools that let parents (and trusted contacts) stay in touch with the wearer. Through the new Fitbit Ace app (that adults can install on iOS or Android), guardians can set play time, monitor activity progress and send calls or messages. On the watch itself, kids can also use the onscreen keyboard or microphone to type or dictate texts or choose an emoji.</p>

<p>Samsung's largest workers' organization, the National Samsung Electronics Union, has announced that it's planning to stage a walkout next week as part of its fight for fair compensation. Members are threatening to skip work for a day, on June 7, in hopes that the company would listen to their demands after their wage negotiations over the past months had come to a standstill. If it pushes through, <a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/samsung-union-plans-first-ever-strike-as-wage-talks-break-down-1.2078421"><em>BNN Bloomberg</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>says it'll be the first strike ever by the company's employees since Samsung was founded.

Physical activity during waking hours is also taken into account.</p>

<p>Ahead of Microsoft finishing up its acquisition of Activision Blizzard, it said bringing that publisher’s titles to Xbox Game Pass might take some time. We’ve only seen one so far(<em>Diablo IV</em>), but the company now has added a notable one. In fact, it’s a game that isn’t even here yet. <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> will be <a href="https://www.engadget.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-is-coming-to-xbox-game-pass-on-its-release-day-142823681.html">available on Game Pass</a> on its release day, later this year.</p>
<p>In Black Ops style, it’s a tactical play. Almost every year in recent memory, the latest Call of Duty release has been the best-selling game. Microsoft is relying on the debut of a new Call of Duty game to draw players to its Game Pass. $10 a month is cheaper than the price of the game, but it’s also a subscription. And the company is banking on Xbox gamers continuing that sub.</p>
