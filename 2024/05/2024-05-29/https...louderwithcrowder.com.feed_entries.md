However, the left has injected the movement with steroids and we are at the point where any subjective feeling or thought must be affirmed no matter how deranged or bizarre it is. So much so that even drag queens have started to invade storytime. </p><p>Drag queens are especially annoying because their entire portrayal of women is misogynistic and over-sexualized in extreme ways that there's no way for one to deny that they aren't mocking women. And when you combine that with trans ideology, you get this story. </p><p>A woman thought she was a man, so much so that she got a medically unnecessary double mastectomy. Common sense would tell you that she is terribly uncomfortable with her womanhood. However, she is also a drag queen, which probably means she

However, that is not the status quo, as all three are struggling to find entry-level jobs with experience and degrees, especially considering the competition with foreign applicants who are also educated and qualified.
