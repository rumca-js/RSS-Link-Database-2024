		<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/zighra">Zighra</a> has won a contract with Shared Services Canada (SSC) to protect digital identities with threat detection and Zero Trust with on-device behavioral biometrics.

SSC will test Zighra DeepSense for its effectiveness at protecting the networks, data and applications used by Canadian government departments. The contract was awarded under the Innovative Solutions Canada (ISC) program, but the terms of the deal were not disclosed.

Zighra says DeepSense provides explainable, continuous identity validation and threat detection by comparing behavioral models created with AI with end-user activity. That explainability helps build trust and enable compliance, according to the company announcement.

		The rise in <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/?posttype=all&amp;s=deepfake">deepfake</a> audio technology has significant threats in various domains, such as personal privacy, political manipulation, and national security. To address these risks, Toronto-based <a href="https://www.klick.com/">Klick Health</a>, through its research arm Klick Labs, has developed a biometric method to distinguish between audio clips voiced by humans and those generated by artificial intelligence. The approach involves analyzing vocal biomarkers, which are features present in voices that can reveal information about the speaker's health or physiology.

		The <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/fido-alliance">FIDO Alliance</a> is launching a biometrics testing program to provide Face Verification Certification to enable vendors to demonstrate accuracy and lack of bias in their remote biometric identity verification technologies.

Independent evaluation is important for the entire identity lifecycle, but “if you have weak onboarding methodologies, it creates a big back door for attackers,” FIDO Alliance Executive Director and CEO Andrew Shikiar tells <em>Biometric Update </em>in an interview. “So, we’ve always had a vision to strengthen the identity verification process.”

Certification is based on at least 10,000 test verifications, with requirements based on established ISO standards, FIDO says. Identity v
