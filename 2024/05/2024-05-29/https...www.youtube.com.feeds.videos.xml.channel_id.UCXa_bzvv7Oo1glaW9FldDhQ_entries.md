According to recent reoorts, however, neither Resident Evil 1 nor Resident Evil 5 is being remade. As per prominent insider Dusk Golem, the developer is currently working on remakes of Resident Evil Zero and Resident Evil - Code: Veronica (which, as per the insider, are two among five Resident Evil games that are currently being worked on, Resident Evil 9 being another one). 

Other reliable sources like IGN and VGC's Andy Robinson have also corroborated Dusk Golem's claims, which means it's looking more than a likely at this point that the next remakes we see from Resident Evil are going to be ones that not many would have expected to see.

It's hard to believe that Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege has survived for this long, especially given how other live service titles have come and gone. Nevertheless, the tactical shooter gameplay continues to resonate with players to this day, becoming one of the genre's most successful titles and a core pillar of revenue.

Despite its success and active player base, however, the publisher decided it best to introduce yet another monetization practice to the game - R6 Membership. It offers cosmetic items, some exclusive to the service, access to the premium Battle Pass, Credits and more to subscribers.

The problem is it arrives at a time when other issues demand attention, to say nothing of the lack of content in the coming season. Maybe it's just the developer attempting to cash in on the subscription trend. Either way, players aren't having it.
