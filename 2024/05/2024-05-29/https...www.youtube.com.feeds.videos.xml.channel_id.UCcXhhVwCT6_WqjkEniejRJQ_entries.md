After studying how to improve my design process it's time to roll up the sleeves and actually start implementing what I´ve learned. In this episode I am trying to work from design requirements rather than just designing on a whim. It is not easy internalizing a brand new design sequence and sometimes I am still getting ahead of myself, but I think In general I have a much more grounded view: I am more focused on deciding WHAT the machine should do rather then HOW it should do it. This is the better place to start. Extra thanks to everyone who are sticking around during this very theoretical phase of the project, I am doing what I think I need to do to make progress! :) M
