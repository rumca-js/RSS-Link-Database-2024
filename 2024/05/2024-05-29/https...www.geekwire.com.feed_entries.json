In an internal memo sent to employees in February, Expedia said it expected about 1,500 roles to be impacted, primarily in its Product &#38; Technology division, under an operational review. That accounts for more than 8% of its workforce. &#8220;As we indicated earlier this year, we\u2019ve recently completed many of our significant technical&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2024/expedia-group-lays-off-36-workers-in-seattle-as-part-of-broader-cuts/\">Read More</a>", "language": "en-US", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2024/expedia-group-lays-off-36-workers-in-seattle-as-part-of-broader-cuts", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed", "source_obj__id": 131, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Expedia Group lays off 36 workers as part of broader cuts", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-05-29T21:23:29+00:00", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"945\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/library1-1260x945.jpeg\" width=\"1260\" /><br />For a place that&#8217;s traditionally supposed to be quiet, the Broadview branch of the Seattle Public Library was exceptionally so on Wednesday. After a cyberattack knocked out much of the technology required to run a modern library system, Broadview was decidedly slow and empty. The tap-tapping normally occurring on numerous computers hooked to free Wi-Fi was nonexistent. There was no whirring sound of tech in action in the corner dedicated to a copy machine, printer, scanner and fax machine. Signs at the entrances and on all machines that rely on tech warned patrons that most systems were no-go.

Libraries in Toronto and London also recently suffered major cybersecurity breaches, knocking out technical infrastructure and causing serious disruption to services that lasted several months. Ransomware attacks rose significantly last year. They typically involve hackers who leverage credentials or exploit software vulnerabilities, make data inaccessible or threaten to leak it, then demand exorbitant payments from victims. Recent high-profile attacks have hit auction house Christie&#8217;s and healthcare systems including Ascension and Change Healthcare. Public libraries are a &#8220;curious&#8221; target given that they are&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2024/why-did", "language": "en-US", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2024/why-did-ransomware-hackers-target-seattle-public-library", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed", "source_obj__id": 131, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Why did ransomware hackers target Seattle Public Library?", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-05-29T15:05:47+00:00", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Trent-Gillespie-Headshot-Square-High-Res.jpg\" width=\"500\" /><br />After he left Amazon following more than eight years as an executive working on such things as last-mile delivery innovation and Alexa privacy compliance, Trent Gillespie would often be approached to share what he learned at the tech giant.
