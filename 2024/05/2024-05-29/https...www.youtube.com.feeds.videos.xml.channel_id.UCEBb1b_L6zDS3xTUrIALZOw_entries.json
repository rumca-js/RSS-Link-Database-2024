When he arrived at MIT as a graduate student in the late 1960s, Abelson became involved in exploring computers\u2019 potential as educational tools. One of his first projects, under the guidance of Prof. Seymour Papert, involved working to create a graphics display for use with the Logo programming language, which had first been introduced to schoolkids just a year or two earlier. In this episode, Prof. Abelson reminisces about those early experiences and discusses the importance of computer education for everyone\u2013including, and especially, for children who have the power to make real-world impact through their programming work. He also weighs in on the risks associated with artificial intelligence, and describes his involvement in MIT\u2019s decision to ", "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gW7BnC3jsVk", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCEBb1b_L6zDS3xTUrIALZOw", "source_obj__id": 437, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/gW7BnC3jsVk/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "What's Worth Making? with Prof. Hal Abelson", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
