<p>Hello, my name is Michael, and I&rsquo;m a multi-monitor addict. If I don&rsquo;t have at least three screens in front of me at all times, I feel like I&rsquo;m not being productive enough. It&rsquo;s gotten so bad that I&rsquo;ve taken to packing a portable monitor along with my laptop&mdash;but maybe if I get this new dual-screen design from GPD, I won&rsquo;t have to anymore.</p>



<p>You might recognize GPD as the China-based manufacturer of neat little gaming emulator devices. In recent years, they&rsquo;ve branched out into full laptop designs, albeit smaller ones with game controls attached.</p>



<p>The GPD Duo is a radical departure, both from the company&rsquo;s bread and butter and conventional laptop designs. The big news is that it sports two 13.3-inch OLED displays that are stacked one on top of the other.</p>



<p>We&rsquo;ve seen a few dual-scr

<p>Arm has confirmed that it will be offering actual chips to its customers as part of its next-gen Arm compute platform, called Arm CSS for Client. These chips will be first marketed at Android smartphones, but executives also mentioned that they could be used for PCs as well.</p>



<p>The announcement confirms an <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2331399/arm-wants-to-make-ai-chips-as-soon-as-2025.html">earlier report</a> that indicated that Arm might expand its traditional business model. Arm has traditionally sold CPU designs, not silicon, to partners like Qualcomm. Those companies have the freedom to adjust Arm&rsquo;s designs &mdash; depending upon their license agreement &mdash; and then ask foundries like TSMC to actually manufacture the chip.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This graphics card is just entirely too inexpensive for my taste,&rdquo; <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/613765/should-you-spend-up-for-a-hyper-fast-graphics-card.html">said no one, ever</a>. While we&rsquo;re past the incredibly inflated prices of the pandemic and crypto crunch, high-end graphics cards are still far from affordable.</p>



<p>And they&rsquo;re about to get even more expensive in the US, thanks to a little international saber-rattling between America and China.</p>



<p>The US had temporarily halted the 25 percent tariff on some Chinese electronics imports in 2022, but the administration has decided to let that stay expire at the end of this month. <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://ustr.gov/about-us/policy-offices/press-office/press-releases/2024/may/ustr-extends-certain-exclusions-china-sec

<p>Hot-swap keyboards are a revolutionary development in the world of mechanical keyboards, allowing users to swap individual switches without soldering. This feature opens up a whole new dimension of customizability and maintenance that is attractive to both beginners and experienced users. <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2321778/the-one-mechanical-keyboard-feature-i-cant-live-without.html">Some enthusiasts can&rsquo;t live without it</a>. </p>



<p>But what exactly makes a keyboard &ldquo;hot-swappable&rdquo;? And how do switches and sockets work with this technology? </p>



<p>A hot-swappable socket is a special device on the printed circuit board (PCB) of a keyboard that allows you to easily plug and unplug mechanical switches. These sockets are designed to mechanically hold the switch in place while making an electrical connection without soldering.

<p>One of the less pleasant news in this autumn&rsquo;s major upgrade of Windows 11 (24H2) is that the built-in support for Dolby Digital audio is removed.</p>



<p>If you have files that use the codec in question, i.e. AC-3, you will not be able to play them in Windows Media Player or other accompanying apps.</p>



<p>Microsoft points out in a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/windows/codecs-in-media-player-d5c2cdcd-83a2-4805-abb0-c6888138e456&amp;xcust=2-1-2349721-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">support</a> document that the change only applies to new installations.

<p>A good laptop is only as good as its ports. That&rsquo;s a saying I just made up but there&rsquo;s some truth to it. While there are some <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1072047/best-ultraportable-laptops.html">ultraportable laptops</a> that can make do with just a couple of USB-C connections, trusting you to use adapters for everything else, most people will prefer to have a wider selection on-board.

<p>Microsoft Word is one of the most widely used programs in the world, yet it&rsquo;s also one that many complain about. The most common criticism? That it&rsquo;s heavy, slow, and a typical example of &ldquo;feature bloat.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Which is true. Word <em>is</em> packed with tons of features. And while some critics think that most people only use it because everyone else is using it, Word is actually quite powerful and capable.</p>
