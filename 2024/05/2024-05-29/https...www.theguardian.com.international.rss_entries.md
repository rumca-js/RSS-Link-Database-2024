<p>Replacing the US-bound Emma Hayes is a huge ask, but the new manager has the necessary experience and credentials</p><p>Emma Hayes has not left alone for the United States. Joining the former Chelsea manager in the US women’s national team set-up are her assistant coach Denise Reddy, goalkeeper coach Stuart Searle, head of performance Bart Caubergh, performance analyst Ferdia O’Hanrahan and opposition scout Cameron Meighan. Camille Abily and Théo Rivrin are joining Sonia Bompastor to resume their assistant manager and assistant coach roles with the former Lyon manager, but Bompastor has a big job ahead in replacing so many highly regarded staff, in particular Searle. Fortunately for Bompastor, the general manager, Paul Green, who was Hayes’s right-hand man, remains in post and has been leading that process and helping to ensure a smooth introduction to life at the club.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/may/29/sonia-bompastor-chelsea-key-tasks">Continue

<p>Is it a religious organisation? A management company for dancers? A brainwashing sect? This fascinating, unusually sensitive Netflix documentary looks at a dark, sad tale</p><p>Dancing for the Devil: The 7M TikTok Cult has plenty of components that are lurid, brash and sensational. It’s about a loosely affiliated group of TikTok dancers in Los Angeles, who sign up to 7M, a management company that is also a private, invite-only church led by a pastor named Robert Shinn. Many of the dancers’ friends and family members now believe that they have joined a cult, and certainly the testimonies of ex-members suggest that they have strong reason to suspect that. But this takes its many stranger-than-fiction components and turns them into a story that is unusually sensitive, for Netflix at least, and also desperately sad.</p><p>The director Derek Doneen uses the Wilking sisters as his point of entry into what begins as a tale about the spectacle of social media and ambitious young people.

<p>Louisiana, with one of the US’s worst maternal mortality rates, wants to make abortion medication a ‘controlled substance’</p><p>This week, Louisiana moved to expand the criminalization of abortion further than any state has since before Roe v Wade was decided. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/23/us/politics/louisiana-abortion-pills-controlled-substances.html">On Thursday</a>, the state legislature passed a bill that would reclassify mifepristone and misoprostol – the two drugs used in a majority of American abortions – as dangerous controlled substances.</p><p>Under both state and federal classifications, the category of controlled substances includes those medications known to cause mind-altering effects and create the potential for addictions, such as sedatives and opioids; abortion medications carry none of this potential for physical dependence, habit-forming or abuse. The move from Louisiana lawmakers runs counter to both established medical opinion and federal law. J

<p>A comedic hunt for raw footballing talent in Africa explores a new kind of colonialism</p><p>Once upon a time, football was a local affair. A club really was a club, belonging to its members, who were footballers and fans alike, all drawn from the same town, village or factory. But today nothing could be more global. A Premier League side may still bear the name of&nbsp;some backwater that briefly flowered in the Industrial Revolution, but it will derive its players and supporters, its owners and managers, its revenue and capital from every corner of the Earth.</p><p>This transformation is relatively recent, and literature has yet to catch up. Football narratives tend to be nostalgic and parochial: the neurotic north London of Nick Hornby’s Fever Pitch, the class-conscious Yorkshire of David Peace’s The Damned United. English writers seem unable to escape football’s myriad outdated local mythologies, a game invented by Englishmen but whose world span now far exceeds their imaginati

<p>John Rosman’s effective debut intertwines the lives of a woman escaping a black-site facility and a woman hired to contain the outbreak</p><p>Amid the dumper-truck of post-Covid lockdown-inspired films, very few take disease and pandemics themselves as their central focus (maybe after rewatching Contagion, we were all too eager to forget). So John Rosman’s stripped-back but effective debut is a sobering flashback to those incubative early days, its title punning its title punning on the microbe that asymptomatic protagonist Jessica (Hayley Erin) is carrying on her person, as well as her hopes for a fresh start, unharassed by government spooks, north of the Canadian border.</p><p>All we know at the start is that blood-splattered Jessica has just escaped imprisonment in some black-site facility. She bundles herself into a pickup heading north, which luckily belongs to kindly farmer Frank (Blaine Palmer), who sends her on her way with a new jacket and a rucksack full of tinned food. R

<p>After cancer, my health anxieties kept me awake at night. But when a marauding moose put paid to our well, our only source of water, I felt my mindset shift</p><p>It was clear the moose was to blame for the lack of water. Halfway down the ravine, far from the house in southern Alberta, Canada, tracks circled our well. The moose had punched straight through the plywood cover, exposing the pump and pipe to freezing temperatures. For&nbsp;20&nbsp;years, my husband and I had been saying we should replace the flimsy wooden lid with a metal one, but it was never a priority. That is, until last winter, when we lost our only source of water.</p><p>Regaling my therapist with stories of the moose was an easy way to start our session. She laughed along when I told her about hauling jugs of water from our neighbour’s place, about my dirty hair and how there was just enough water to wash the critical bits. But when she paused and then clicked her tongue, I knew the fun was over. “How do you fee

<p>Modine plays amateur cyclist  and teacher Greg Townsend, leading troubled teenagers on a gruelling journey across Colorado in a real-life-inspired drama</p><p>‘I’ve never had a bike before,” says a teenage boy, grinning from ear to ear. This earnest, likable drama is inspired by the real-life amateur cyclist Greg Townsend, a teacher at a Colorado young offenders educational institution. For years, Townsend led boys on 700-mile bike tours from Denver to the Grand Canyon, sleeping out under the stars. His story has been fictionalised here into a formulaic sports movie that unfolds predictably, exactly on cue, with no surprises or upsets. But I warmed to its sensitivity; it possesses an insistence that these difficult boys are vulnerable and scared kids (undermined only slightly by the fact that the actors playing them look well into their 20s).</p><p>Matthew Modine is Townsend, who understands childhood trauma. In flashbacks, we watch him repeatedly beaten up as a boy by his physical

Dr Francisco Trujillo, a senior lecturer in the school of chemical engineering, and the PhD student Nikunj Naliyadhara explain the coffee they’re about to make is sonicated, or hit with ultrasonic waves.

Peter Walker reports</p><p>It started with more a whimper than a bang. Rishi Sunak’s surprise election announcement was marred by pouring rain and a protester blasting out the Labour 1997 campaign classic Things Can Only Get Better. But since then things have not exactly got any better for Sunak.</p><p>From Steve Baker going on holiday to Lucy Allan endorsing a Reform candidate, his MPs have not all fallen into line, while Michael Gove surprised many by joining the large number of Tory MPs saying they will not stand. The Guardian’s senior political correspondent <strong>Peter Walker</strong> says that while not disastrous, it is certainly far from the smooth, slick start Sunak would have wanted to his campaign.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2024/may/29/why-is-rishi-sunak-election-campaign-so-chaotic-podcast">Continue re
