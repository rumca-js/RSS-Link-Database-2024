In an internal memo sent to employees in February, Expedia said it expected about 1,500 roles to be impacted, primarily in its Product &#38; Technology division, under an operational review. That accounts for more than 8% of its workforce. &#8220;As we indicated earlier this year, we’ve recently completed many of our significant technical&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/expedia-group-lays-off-36-workers-in-seattle-as-part-of-broader-cuts/">Read More</a>

After a cyberattack knocked out much of the technology required to run a modern library system, Broadview was decidedly slow and empty. The tap-tapping normally occurring on numerous computers hooked to free Wi-Fi was nonexistent. There was no whirring sound of tech in action in the corner dedicated to a copy machine, printer, scanner and fax machine. Signs at the entrances and on all machines that rely on tech warned patrons that most systems were no-go.

Libraries in Toronto and London also recently suffered major cybersecurity breaches, knocking out technical infrastructure and causing serious disruption to services that lasted several months. Ransomware attacks rose significantly last year. They typically involve hackers who leverage credentials or exploit software vulnerabilities, make data inaccessible or threaten to leak it, then demand exorbitant payments from victims. Recent high-profile attacks have hit auction house Christie&#8217;s and healthcare systems including Ascension and Change Healthcare. Public libraries are a &#8220;curious&#8221; target given that they are&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/why-did
