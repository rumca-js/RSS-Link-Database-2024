For media storage, since the Mac didn't have enough physical space, I opted for an external hard drive directly plugged into it. I then disconnected this hard drive to plug it into my router and serve it as a network drive. Until recently, it worked amazingly well, and I was happy.</p> <p>However, the external drive now disconnects randomly (whether it's connected to the router or directly to the Mac Mini), so I'm looking for another solution. I'm considering a NAS, but maybe it's overkill. So, here I am looking for suggestions.</p> <p>thanks all :) </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/CripticsVI\"> /u/CripticsVI </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1d373kt/suggestion_for_replacing_a_hdd_connected_to_my/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"", "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1d373kt/suggestion_for_replacing_a_hdd_connected_to_my", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/.rss", "source_obj__id": 450, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Suggestion for Replacing a HDD connected to my Router with something else", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-05-29T08:07:46+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hello its me again talking about Endurain, a fitness activity tracker that you can self host.
