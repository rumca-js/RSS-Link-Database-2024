In this episode I am trying to work from design requirements rather than just designing on a whim. It is not easy internalizing a brand new design sequence and sometimes I am still getting ahead of myself, but I think In general I have a much more grounded view: I am more focused on deciding WHAT the machine should do rather then HOW it should do it. This is the better place to start. Extra thanks to everyone who are sticking around during this very theoretical phase of the project, I am doing what I think I need to do to make progress! :) M\n\nSupport Wintergatan:\n- Patreon \u25ba https://patreon.com/Wintergatan\n- Youtube membership \u25ba https://bit.ly/4cQVM7C\n\nMarble Machine Engineering Discord Server:\nhttps://discord.com/invite/7aSFJA6bkH\n\nVideo edited By Martin and Hannes from the Trainerds YouTube Channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/TRAINERDS\n\n\u2014\nPATREON \u25ba https", "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-0ij4oviM", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCcXhhVwCT6_WqjkEniejRJQ", "source_obj__id": 393, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/Vs-0ij4oviM/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "The Marble Machine Drivetrain", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
