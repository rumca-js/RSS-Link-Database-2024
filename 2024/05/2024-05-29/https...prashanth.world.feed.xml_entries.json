The UI is janky, but I learned a lot getting it to run on device. While there are a lot of projects that run various LLMs on mobile, I think there are only a few that allow images as an input (and I think there weren\u2019t any when I started on this project). Check it out on GitHub. A huge shout out to the author of the llava example in the llama.cpp project, as well as the author of the llama.swiftui (and of course, llama.cpp in general).", "language": null, "link": "https://prashanth.world/llava-on-ios", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://prashanth.world/feed.xml", "source_obj__id": 263, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Running LLaVA on iOS With llama.cpp and TinyLlama", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
