Here\u2019s what to watch this evening</p><p><strong>9pm, BBC One</strong><br />\n Just 12 minutes separate the winners from the runners-up as the final four teams embark upon the last leg of the no-fly journey, which will take them from Indonesia\u2019s capital, Jakarta, to the island of Lombok. With seven countries and nearly 9,000 miles behind them \u2013 they started in Sapporo on the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido \u2013 it\u2019s an infuriatingly short amount of time for whoever doesn\u2019t make it. Stick around for the reunion show at 10.40pm, filmed six months later. <strong>Hollie Richardson</strong></p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/article/2024/may/29/tv-tonight-who-will-get-to-lombok-first-in-the-race-across-the-world-finale\">Continue reading...</a>", "language": "en-UK", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/article/2024/may/29/tv-tonight-who-will-get-to-lombok-first-in-the-race-across-the-world-finale", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "source_obj__id": 340, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/59319645097f7d6f4241d9424b2c0ef1b7e6219a/0_143_4240_2545/master/4240.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4967b4e393c494e0362b89e1ed93d9a2", "title": "TV tonight: who will get to Lombok first in the Race Across the World finale?", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-05-29T05:00:04+00:00", "description": "<p>Widening government-run scheme would counter mistrust among householders, says consumer group</p><p>The next government should force all tradespeople who install home heat pumps, solar panels and insulation to sign up to a mandatory accreditation scheme to counter mistrust in the industry, a leading consumer group is demanding.</p><p>A report from Which? found that households face \u201csignificant anxiety\u201d in choosing tradespeople to fit low-carbon heating systems, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/may/13/are-heat-pumps-more-expensive-to-run-than-gas-boilers\">heat pumps</a>, and insulation after \u201cpress stories about poor work and rogue traders\u201d.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/may/29/make-accreditation-mandatory-for-low-carbon-heating-installers-says-which\">Continue reading...</a>", "language": "en-UK", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/may/29/make-accreditation-mandatory-for-low-carbon-heating-installers-says-which", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "source_obj__id": 340, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a14681490c627732979d446744a41e79e0e01134/0_182_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3fe74195974fdd7f7d7dd3872ca245ed", "title": "Make accreditation mandatory for low-carbon heating installers, says Which?", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-05-29T04:00:03+00:00", "description": "<p>Attendees at Coalition for Ticket Fairness dinner stump up thousands for fighting fund \u2013 because they know their time might be up</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve sold concert tickets, you\u2019ve sold sports tickets, you\u2019ve sold football tickets, you\u2019ve sold theatre tickets \u2026 You\u2019ve made money or you wouldn\u2019t be in this room.\u201d</p><p>The voice of Scot Tobias, one of America\u2019s most successful ticket \u201cbrokers\u201d, boomed out from the stage.
