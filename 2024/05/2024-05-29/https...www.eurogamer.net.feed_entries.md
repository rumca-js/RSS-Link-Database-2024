Sony has certified a PlayStation VR2 PC adapter in South Korea, as the company readies its plans to make its latest VR headset compatible with computers. 
</p><p>
The gadget was <a href="https://www.rra.go.kr/ko/license/A_b_popup.do?app_no=202417210000102053&amp;ref=uploadvr.com">approved</a> by South Korea at the end of March for use in the country. As yet, however, Sony is yet to announce it publicly.
</p><p>
A report on the device by <a href="https://www.uploadvr.com/playstation-vr2-pc-adapter-certified-regulator/">UploadVR</a> speculates that the gizmo will allow the headset to simply plug into your PC via the adapter device.

## No Man's Sky's latest update lets players explore a lonely abandoned universe devoid of life

Exploratory space sim No Man's Sky increasing tilt into the wonderfully bizarre continues today with the launch of a brand-new update, titled Adrift, which this time lets players explore an abandoned universe where civilisation has come to an end.
</p><p>
Adrift is, at least in part, a nod to No Man's Sky's earliest days - where lifeforms were scarce and exploration was an entirely solo, wonderfully lonely endeavour against a seemingly endless backdrop of stars. "There's so much we love about the game now," Hello Games says, "but there was something unique at release in how alone you felt in the universe."
</p><p>
To that end, Adrift gives players the option to explore an alternative universe of broken, rusted buildings and lost Travellers graves, that's free of other lifeforms, shops, trading, shortcuts, or help - all

## Crow Country review - retro horror thrills that offer much more than mere nostalgia

My head is still full of things I forgot to forget as games grew and evolved and expanded beyond the blocky figures and pixelated gore I grew up with. Stuff like the sound of the cursor flicking over the items in the inventory, or knowing I can reload from the menu, or knowing, with cast iron certainty, that I'll find more handgun ammo than shotgun shells around here, which in turn will be more plentiful than the magnum ammo. Perhaps that's why Crow Country feels so much like coming home.</p><p>Well. You know. If I stomped around home melting deformed denizens with my flamethrower, anyway.</p><p>I'll be honest, though; these kinds of retro homages? I'm kinda done. And by kinda, I mean totally, and by done, I mean I've absolut

## MultiVersus relaunch comes with character restrictions, and people aren't happy

MultiVersus welcomed over 100,000 Steam brawlers on its relaunch, but new character restrictions have left a bad taste in the mouth of players.
</p><p>
The multi-franchise Warner Bros. fighter re-released last night across PC, Xbox and PlayStation, following the end of its open beta last year. On <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1818750/charts/">Steam</a>, it recorded a concurrent player peak of 114,515 in the last 24 hours.
</p><p>
However, despite some fairly impressive numbers, the free-to-play brawler has come under fire from the community for a number of reasons, with the main issue being new character restrictions.

## Does Mario Kart's Blue Shell even work? An investigation

It's also one of the most controversial. A mainstay of the series since Mario Kart 64, the Blue Shell is a laser-guided missile targeted at the player in first place. It is near-unavoidable, and completely unavoidable in older games. Every Mario Kart player knows the feeling of dread - and childlike injustice - that accompanies the Blue Shell's sudden, high-pitched siren whine, announcing an unceremonious end to your pleasant race lead. But <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/459365997/The-Mechanical-Impact-of-Mario-Kart-s-Blue-Shell">a research project at Queen's University Belfast</a> has asked a fascinating question about the Blue Shell: does it even work?</p>

## Cyberpunk 2077 development has finally wound down after three and a half years

Three-and-a-half years after its disastrous December 2020 debut, after dozens of patches and the launch of last year's Phantom Liberty expansion, CD Projekt Red no longer has anyone working on Cyberpunk 2077.
</p><p>
Just 17 people had been working on the game still as of 29th February this year, CD Projekt previously shared as part of their last financial update. Now, as of 30th April, that number is zero. 
</p><p>
It's a small but significant moment for CD Projekt as it finally leaves Cyberpunk 2077 behind - with the vast bulk of its development might now focused on its next game in The Witcher series, currently still codenamed Polaris.

The Sims 4, you might recall, is currently embarking on a sexy "summer of love" - which, so far, has mainly involved <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-4-is-getting-ready-for-a-summer-of-sexy-updates-starting-with-swimsuits">some new swimsuits</a>. Now, though, EA has <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/cozy-bistro-and-riviera-retreat-kits">revealed</a> the next two items on its vaguely saucy list: the Riviera Retreat and Cozy Bistro Kit DLC, both arriving on 30th May.
</p><p>
First up, for those summery sunny days of relaxation and shameless undress, is the Riviera Retreat - a "secluded oasis" incorporating "stucco textures, beautiful archways, and shimmering waterfalls with comfortable linen furniture, wicker lounge chairs, and vine-covered pergolas."

This one's all about creating an "ambience of
