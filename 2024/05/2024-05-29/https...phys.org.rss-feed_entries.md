In a paper recently published in Nature Communications, the HUN-REN-ELTE Protein Modeling Research Group (Institute of Chemistry) has laid the foundations for a mathematical method, allowing the computer-assisted comparison of the three-dimensional structures of proteins. The method is unique in that while the alternatives available so far only took into account the position of the atoms, the new technique, called LoCoHD (Local Composition Hellinger Distance), also includes the chemical information of the atoms.

A research team has successfully assembled a nearly gap-free, telomere-to-telomere (T2T) genome of Populus ussuriensis, filling gaps present in the P. trichocarpa genome. Leveraging long-read sequencing, the team identified and annotated centromere regions in all double haploid (DH) genome chromosomes, providing a first for poplars. With 34,953 protein-coding genes, this genome surpasses P. trichocarpa by 465 genes.

Fishing trawls cause significant CO2 emissions as they stir up the carbon bound in the seabed and release it again. It is also clear that they drastically affect ecosystems in the ocean. A new study by the Helmholtz-Zentrum Hereon models the influence of bottom trawls on sedimentary carbon in the North Sea. It also shows that restrictions on fishing in certain areas would benefit life in the ocean and on land.

## Study reveals maintenance of male-related genes after loss of males in stick insects

Traits are often lost during evolution, either because they are no longer beneficial or because they are too costly to maintain. When this happens, it is generally believed that the genes underlying the trait will eventually degrade as well, making it difficult if not impossible for the trait to re-emerge. Yet there are numerous examples in nature of once-lost traits re-emerging in descendent lineages.

## The threat posed by climate change: Study shows among over-40-year-olds, parents worry just as much as non-parents

Future generations will suffer increasingly more from the consequences of climate change than we do today. Presumably, older people with children will be more worried about climate change than those of the same age without children, as they will also factor the remaining lifetime of their offspring into their assessment. Yet, this is not the case, as shown by a recent study by the German Centre of Gerontology.

## Insect frass becomes food for protein-rich microalgae

As the demand for protein-rich food increases with population growth and rising awareness of nutrition and health, traditional animal and plant-based protein sources that require arable land or freshwater put significant pressure on land and resources. Therefore, there is a great need for new, more sustainable protein sources.

Aquatic ecosystems are complex environments that can be affected by many variables, including weather, the biological activities of the organisms living within them, and anthropogenic nutrient pollution. The influence these variables may have on aquatic ecosystems can also depend on the characteristics of the water body, such as temperature and depth. These interconnected processes can be tipped out of balance with devastating consequences.
