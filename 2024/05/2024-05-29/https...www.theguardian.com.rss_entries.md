Billed as Europe’s third-tier competition, it gives the fans of teams who wouldn’t normally get to qualify for Big Vase an opportunity to enjoy a taste of European competition, while any teams that qualify are guaranteed to earn £2.5m before they’ve even kicked a ball. While such an amount is small beer to the likes of Aston Villa, Fenerbahce or Lille, it constitutes quite the lottery win for minnows such as Iceland’s Breiðablik, crack Faroese outfit Klaksvíkar Ítróttarfelag and other teams Football Daily had never heard of before they qualified for this season’s group stage.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/may/29/olympiakos-face-fiorentina-in-

<p>In a new exhibition, artists find new ways to look at and investigate their natural surroundings and how they interact with human stories</p><p>The striking collection of photographic art presented in the Carnegie Museum of Art’s Widening the Lens is very much a revision of the long tradition of landscape photography in the US. It may be very directly revising – as in AK Burns’s reinvention of landscape photographs literally ripped from photo books – or it may be much more subtly so, as with Sam Contis’s careful deconstructions of the iconography of the American west. However so, this is a show very much about counter-narratives, hidden histories, reinscription, reinvention, and revision.</p><p>Borne of a desire to consider how our relationship with images has shifted as photography has become shockingly more ubiquitous and prolific, Widening the Lens looks at photographs both as singular objects as well as pieces integrated into larger objects.

<p>Katharina Sporrer’s abducted runaway bride is credible but the rest of the cast are so stilted it sounds more like a radio play than a film</p><p>This claustrophobic thriller takes place almost entirely in the boot of a rented car moving down an empty Texas highway. Bride Amanda (Katharina Sporrer), still in her floofy white wedding dress, is trapped inside the vehicle, having been kidnapped at the parking garage where she was dropping off the rented car she used to run away from her own wedding. Luckily for both her and the film, she has her mobile phone to hand and manages to make some calls, first to what she thinks is emergency services, only to realise she’s actually speaking to her kidnapper (Caspar Phillipson). Who doesn’t hate it when that happens?</p><p>Despite the all-American setting and accents, this was made by a Danish film company, led by writer-director Jonas Kvist Jensen, whose filmography consists of lots of shorts and two features of a horror/thriller persuasion,

<p>An incisive analysis of how the controversial ideology has permeated modern life</p><p>In 1945, Antony Fisher visited the neoliberal economist Friedrich Hayek at the London School of Economics. Fisher, an old Etonian who&nbsp;worked in the City, shared the Austrian’s belief that the nascent postwar welfare state would eventually lead to totalitarianism. Fisher wanted Hayek’s advice. Should he go into politics? No, the professor said, something like a thinktank would have far more “decisive influence in the great battle of ideas”.</p><p>Fisher went on to found the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA), the outfit widely credited, among other things, with incubating Liz Truss’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/sep/01/shes-totally-lost-it-inside-story-of-the-unravelling-of-liz-trusss-premiership">disastrous premiership</a>.
