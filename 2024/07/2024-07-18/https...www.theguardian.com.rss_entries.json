I think his success should partly be measured in the seeds that have been sown for future England managers. The penalty win against Switzerland at the Euros was my best moment. There was a redemptive quality to it that had roots going as deep as the manager\u2019s miss in 1996. Cathartic. Of the names the bookies are running with, I\u2019d happily take Mauricio Pochettino or Thomas Tuchel.
