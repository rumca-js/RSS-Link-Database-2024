<p>Many moons ago, back in 2013, we <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-05-21-microsoft-announces-halo-live-action-tv-series-created-by-343-an.html"><ins>learned</ins></a> that Hollywood royalty Steven Spielberg had teamed up with Microsoft to create a live-action Halo television series. It took about ten years for the vision to finally come to fruition, but the show has now been canceled by the Paramount+ streaming service after a mere seventeen episodes. The first season <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/halo-paramount-plus-march-24-2022-194545167.html"><ins>aired</ins></a> in 2022 and the second earlier this year. We had <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/halo-tv-review-paramount-plus-171705080.html"><ins>mixed feelings</ins></a> about the show's debut, but it's still a sad conclusion for the big-budget project.</p>

<p>Netflix is expanding its games roster with an intriguing (and probably gruesome) new tie-in. During the company's quarterly earnings <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2024/q2/FINAL-Q2-24-Shareholder-Letter.pdf"><ins>announcement</ins></a>, Netflix shared that it plans to launch a multiplayer game inspired by <em>Squid Game</em>. Its release date will be timed to coincide with the second season of the South Korean TV sensation. We have no other information about what style of game it will be, but we can guess that it will echo the children's games contestants play for survival on the series.</p>
<p>The program has already spawned several spinoffs for the streaming service. After season 1 became an international sensation in 2021, Netflix created a <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/squid-game-sandbox-vr-game-193540468.html"><ins>virtual reality version</ins></a> as well as an <a class="no-affiliate-link"

<p>One of the founders of the movie ticketing service Fandango has died following an apparent suicide in New York City.</p>
<p>J. Michael Cline, the co-founder of the movie ticket website and service Fandango, died Tuesday after falling from the balcony of a Manhattan hotel in what the medical examiner’s office ruled as a suicide, according to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/18/nyregion/fandango-j-michael-cline-dead.html"><em>The New York Times</em></a>.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Cline co-founded Fandango in 2000 with former chief operating officer Art Levitt during the dot-com boom and became one of the biggest online retailers.

This sounds like a pretty darn tasty recipe to me.</p>
<p>The Spiritborn is a dexterity-driven class with four Spirit Guardians whose powers you can draw on in combat. The jaguar grants fire damage and the eagle offers lightning damage abilities. With the gorilla, players get defensive power and surviva

<p>The last couple of Alien movies have been good for the most part but it feels like they’ve been missing the raw, skin-shredding tension of the first few films. The latest trailer for <em>Alien: Romulus</em> looks like the series is headed back to its dark, claustrophobic roots.</p>
<div id="84cd8a095c3842288987d6d2554b2de5"></div>
<p><em>Alien: Romulus</em> features a whole new crew of doomed space-trekking souls who encounter the deadly Xenomorph on a derelict spacecraft. This time, it’s a crew of space colonizers who are scavenging for resources from abandoned ships and stations.</p>

This is an obvious boon for couch co-op addicts, as you can have two Joy-Cons charging on the dock and another two charging via the console at the same time. Nintendo’s charging station also integrates with the company’s retro wireless NES gamepads, which are primarily used with Nintendo Switch Online games.</p>
<p>The Joy-Con Charging Stand (Two-Way) accessory draws power from the Switch’s dock, via the USB-C port, or any other power adapter. The vertical support can also be removed to make it more portable, another bonus for those couch co-op sleepovers. Nintendo hasn’t released any pricing information yet to go along with the October release date. It’s currently set for a launch in Europe and Japan.

<p>It was a shame to see 1047 Games <a href="https://www.engadget.com/splitgate-final-season-feature-development-ending-1047-games-new-game-211736138.html"><ins>putting </ins><em><ins>Splitgate</ins></em><ins> on ice</ins></a> back in 2022. The studio did a great job of freshening up the competitive arena shooter genre by adding portals (think: Quake meets Portal), but it moved on to a new project. We now know that’s going to be <em>Splitgate 2,</em> a free-to-play sequel that’s coming to PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S next year.</p>
<p>1047 Games is going bigger in all kinds of ways this time around, including with a much larger development team.

However, Apple Intelligence, the most exciting upgrade, is conspicuously (but unsurprisingly) absent.</p>
<p>The update also improves several native apps, such as Photos, Messages (RCS! Gasp!) and Notes, although Apple Intelligence will add even more features and tricks. While we all wait for the ability to generate our own emojis, there is still plenty to explore. It’s just a little drier than what Apple teased at WWDC.</p>

<p>Xfinity is giving its customers access to better picture quality, just in time for the Paris Olympics. To start with, its customers will have the ability to enable Dolby Vision HDR and Dolby Atmos via the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/comcast-xfinity-stream-app-apple-tv-141515987.html">Xfinity Stream app</a> on compatible streaming devices and TVs for the first time, if they watch USA Network's Paris Olympics coverage. That will give them access to a viewing experience with more detailed pictures and immersive sounds even if they're not streaming through an Xfinity box.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The telecommunications division of Comcast is also debuting an enhanced 4K viewing experience for all customers of its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cbs-all-access-comcast-xfinity-x1-now-available-203500862.html">X1 platform</a> as a whole.

We had previously pulled together this list of worthy under-$25 deals, and we've just updated it to reflect these affordable bargains that are still available as of Thursday morning.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>As a reminder (and for the uninitiated): <a href="https://www.engadget.com/how-we-test-and-ethics-statement-213125639.html">Engadget treats tech deals</a> with the same care as we would “regular” tech news. When we scour the web for deals, we’re looking not only for the best prices possible, but also the best products as well. Our goal with our deals coverage, especially surrounding events like Amazon Prime Day, is to surface only the best deals we can find on the gadgets we’ve tested and rated highly, or that we’ve used and know to be worth your money.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-prime-day/">Prime Day</a> might be over, but there are a (somewhat surprising) number of Apple deals still live right now. Apple itself doesn’t typically host sales, but we often see deals from Amazon on current-generation Apple devices — most of which will get even better this fall with the software updates Apple <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-intelligence-ai-ios-18-and-the-biggest-announcements-at-wwdc-2024-184422501.html">announced at WWDC</a>. These still-available Apple discounts have become even more appealing, with many sitting at record-low prices. While you won’t see discounts on iPhones or HomePod speakers (Amazon would much prefer that you buy an Echo), you can still pick up most other Apple gear at steep discounts today. Here are the best Prime Day Apple deals you can still get even after the shopping event has ended.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-prime-day/">Amazon Prime Day 2024</a> has ended, but as per usual, there are some deals still lingering today even after the shopping frenzy has died down. During Prime Day, Amazon's site can be pretty overwhelming if you're trying to look for deals on the things you need and want the most. But after Prime Day, it's almost harder to find the best deals you can still get since there's really no dedicated spot for them on Amazon.</p> 
<p>This is where we at Engadget come in. We've done the work to find the best Prime Day deals on tech you can still get today and collected them all below. While Prime members will be happy to see they can still snag some decent sale prices if they missed out on the action yesterday, Amazon shoppers without a Prime membership will be even happier because none of the deals still live are Prime-exclusive anymore. Anyone can shop for them, but only while they last. If you see something you've been eyeing that's stil

<p>It can be hard to look at your kid’s adorable face and not get them every shiny toy they want. But some toys will do better to stimulate their brain than others. If you’re looking for a new plaything for your child but want to ensure it helps their critical thinking and problem solving skills as much as it entertains them, allow us to help. The parents (and aunts, and uncles) of Engadget have tested plenty of educational toys with their little ones over the years — below, we’ve rounded up a few that have had genuine staying power.</p>

<p>Meta has reportedly decided not to offer its upcoming multimodal AI model and future versions to customers <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-will-reportedly-withhold-multimodal-ai-models-from-the-eu-amid-regulatory-uncertainty-215543292.html">in the European Union</a>, citing a lack of clarity on the European regulators’ data protection rules. These newer AI models process not only text but also images and audio, and power AI capabilities across Meta’s platforms. Meta’s move follows a similar decision by Apple, which recently announced it would not release its Apple Intelligence features in Europe due to regulatory concerns.</p>
<p>Meta told <em>Axios</em> it still plans to release Llama 3, the company’s text-only model, in the EU. The company’s primary concern stems from the challenges of training AI models using data from European customers while complying with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the EU’s data protection law. That said, Meta still plans to launch 

## NASA scraps its VIPER project that aimed to look for ice on the moon

<p>NASA's Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover or VIPER <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-26-nasa-viper-rover.html">was going to look for water ice</a> at the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nas-as-viper-rover-will-explore-the-moons-relay-crater-203503487.html">moon's south pole</a>. The agency was hoping that it could help answer important questions, such as where water is on the moon and how much there is for future spacefarers to use. But now <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasa-ends-viper-project-continues-moon-exploration/">NASA has decided to cancel</a> the project and discontinue the rover's development, citing &quot;cost increases, delays to the launch date and the risks of future cost growth.&quot;</p>
<p>The agency has already spent $450 million developing VIPER, according to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/17/science/nasa-viper-moon-rover-canceled.html"><em>The New York Times</em></a> — it's even done assembling the rover and install

<p>Gaming laptops are the true Transformers of the PC world: They’re powerful enough to play your favorite titles, ensuring you get the best gaming experience, but you can also harness their speed for media creation or extreme multitasking, like streaming high-resolution gameplay to Twitch. Today, you can even find a few that weight less than the smallest MacBook Pro, making them solid options for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-laptops-120008636.html">daily drivers</a> as well. For the demanding <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hackers-gave-pro-players-cheats-during-eas-north-american-finals-of-apex-legends-122102739.html"><em>Apex Legends</em></a> player, or the power user just looking for a capable GPU to handle video encoding, it’ll be easier than ever to find the best gaming laptop to suit your needs — but sorting through the seemingly endless number of options can be taxing.

<p>Today, HMD unveiled its newest own-brand smartphone called Skyline. This phone runs on a mid-range Snapdragon 7s Gen2 CPU, and it offers up to 256GB of storage and 12GB of RAM. It has 15W Qi2 wireless charging and its 4600mAh battery lasts “up to 48 hours.” The screen is a 6.55-inch full HD+ panel with a 144Hz refresh rate and up to 1,000 nits of brightness. Pick either pink (maybe they had leftovers from <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/barbies-hot-pink-flip-phone-is-coming-to-the-real-world-this-summer-170805284.html">the Barbie collab</a>) or black for your phone's color. Skyline phones will be available starting in August and will cost $499.</p>
<p>The spotlight feature for Skyline is ease of repairability. This has been a focus for recent projects from HMD, which also <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/the-nokia-g22-is-hmds-first-phone-built-with-repairability-in-mind-140030302.html">makes phones under the Nokia brand</a>.

COVID-19 was still a big part of our lives back then, but the Zone doesn't protect you against the virus. Instead, it's meant to provide <a href="https://www.engadget.com/we-put-the-dyson-zones-air-filters-to-the-test-heres-what-we-found-133014523.html">less-polluted air</a> as you move about your day, battling things like urban toxins and seasonal allergens. However, extremely short battery life and a $949 price plagued that first model, so it wasn't really a device accessible to the masses.</p>
