		Biometrics have been used for a variety of purposes for centuries. Fingerprints, handprints, and various measurements of the body were used to validate contracts, uniquely identify babies from one another, and track and identify criminals.

And yet thousands of years later, we are still asking whether and when biometrics should be used as a means to identify a specific individual.

Why? Data breaches and data misuse. Yet the biometrics themselves are not the fundamental problem. There are no bad biometrics — only bad actors.

		As generative AI capabilities advance, producing convincing fake IDs and selfies has become easier and more accessible than ever before. These deepfakes are often indistinguishable to the human eye and can deceive traditional verification methods.

Fraudsters now possess the ability to exploit online verification systems at an unprecedented scale. Financial institutions and businesses once accustomed to tolerating a small number of fraudulent accounts now face a dramatically amplified threat.

In this inaugural fraud report, explore the latest document fraud techniques observed across industries, including:

- The most commonly used techniques to commit document-related fraud
- Impersonation targets — who gets verified the most, and why older demographics may be prime ta

		The UK government has announced a coming identity verification services bill that will support digital ID products and services from certified providers.

The Digital Information and Smart Data Bill is one of 39 legislative initiatives presented in the King’s Speech on Wednesday which outline plans for the recently elected Labor government led by Prime Minister Keir Starmer during the new parliamentary year.

According to the bill, digital verification services will help people prove information about themselves and allow for smoother online transactions by helping with things like moving house, pre-employment checks, and buying age-restricted goods and services. They will also help lessen the burden on businesses by “reducing costs, time and data leakage.”

		The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (<a href="https://www.va.gov/">VA</a>) says it will implement a more streamlined login process for veterans to access benefit and healthcare services through <a href="http://login.gov">Login.gov</a> or <a href="http://id.me">ID.me</a> accounts.

Pitched in a release as a simplifying measure that is part of the Biden-Harris administration’s “comprehensive efforts to safeguard and protect veteran data and that of their beneficiaries,” the shift to digital is only optional for now. After January 31, 2025, My HealtheVet user ID and passwords will be invalid for signing in to VA websites or apps. After September 30, 2025, DS Logon username and passwords will also become invalid.

		A smartphone app designed to streamline queues for the EU's upcoming border checks will not be available in time for travel to France despite a deadline change, an airline industry executive revealed to <a href="https://www.connexionfrance.com/news/new-biometric-border-checks-french-app-delays-and-photo-issues/665034">The Connexion</a>. The new system, set to launch this autumn, will require non-EU visitors to provide detailed personal information, including entry and exit dates and fingerprint and face biometrics to streamline and secure movement across EU borders.

To mitigate potential long queues, passengers will be asked to register their passport details and answer trip-related questions using self-service kiosks at airports, ports, and at St Pancras Internat

		A data breach at decentralized digital identity verification provider <a href="https://web.fractal.id/">Fractal ID</a> has exposed the ID documents and facial images of thousands of users and sparked online criticism of the company. A hacker gained unauthorized access to a platform operator’s account, and ran an API script for about 2 hours and 15 minutes last Sunday, according to the public <a href="https://app.fractal.id/documents/id/breach-notification.pdf">breach notification</a>.

Fractal ID has over 1 million users, according to its website, and the breach affected 0.5 percent, meaning 50 thousand of them.

The breached data includes users’ names, email addresses, digital wallet addresses, physical addresses, phone numbers, facial images and uploaded photos of documents

		Physical and digital IDs have reached parity in Azerbaijan, where the government has announced that identity information provided through the refreshed <a href="http://my.gov.az">mygov</a> application will be considered every bit as legal as a physical ID card.

ID cards submitted through mygov will simplify and speed up operations, says the Agency for Innovation and Digital Development, which is encouraging institutions to integrate <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202407/bosnia-and-herzegovina-digital-id-agency-refutes-claim-it-overstepped-authority">digital ID</a> functionality broadly. Digital identity cards will have equal legal weight to paper, as will digital marriage, birth and death certificates.

		<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/recfaces">RecFaces</a> is calling for facial recognition technology (FRT) to be used as a key security measure to protect critical infrastructure at the 2024 Olympics in Paris. The company notes that FRT emerges as a crucial tool in bolstering security efforts, offering capabilities in identification, access control, and threat detection.

Integrated into video management systems (VMS), FRT enhances physical security by enabling swift identification of individuals against offender databases. The approach aims to help preemptively deter malicious activities. Real-time monitoring of crowd behavior could further enhance security by allowing immediate response to disruptive incidents, RecFaces claims.

		Organizations have been known to hesitate to report cybersecurity incidents within their infrastructure due to concerns about damaging their reputation and facing potential legal repercussions. However, these concerns can be mitigated through anonymous reporting of cyber threats. To address this, the University of Arkansas at Little Rock (UA Little Rock) has collaborated with <a href="https://www.dock.io/">Dock</a>, a provider of digital identity platforms.

The goal is to integrate Dock’s reusable digital ID platform, <a href="https://www.dock.io/reusable-identity">Certs</a>, into the university’s security incident sharing platform via the U.S. Department of Energy’s emerging threat information sharing and analysis center (ET-ISAC).

		South Africa’s Home Affairs Department says it plans to issue at least 2.5 million smart ID cards with funds from its 2024/2025 budget.

Deputy Minister of Home Affairs, Njabulo Nzuza, disclosed the information at the start of this week as he defended the ministry’s budget for the next financial year in parliament, highlighting priorities for the upcoming fiscal year.

The Homes Affairs budget defended by the deputy minister stands at 10, 495 billion Rand (US$577 million), an increase from the R9,751 billion (US$536 million) in the 2023/2024 financial year.

		<em>By David J. Oberly, Biometric Privacy &amp; Data Privacy Attorney</em>

One of the most significant unsettled issues in Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA) class action litigation pertains to the precise definition and scope of the terms “biometric identifiers,” “biometric information,” and “scans of face geometry” as they are used in BIPA.

Three recent BIPA decisions—<em>Zellmer v. Meta Platforms, Inc.</em>, 2024 U.S. App. LEXIS 14619 (9th Cir. June 17, 2024), <em>Martell v. X Corp.</em>, 2024 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 105610 (N.D. Ill. June 13, 2024), and <em>Tibbs v. Arlo Techs., Inc.</em>, 2024 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 113916 (N.D. Cal. June 27, 2024)—directly address this critical area of uncertainty, offering key insight as to the specific contours
