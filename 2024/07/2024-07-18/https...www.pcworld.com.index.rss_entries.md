<p>Cloud gaming is truly impressive tech under ideal conditions. Both Microsoft and Nvidia are working on their respective offerings, ostensibly competing with each other via Xbox Game Pass and GeForce Now.</p>



<p>Yet despite being competitors, both companies are also deeply committed to PC gaming as a platform. In that context, it makes sense that Microsoft would use its own website to highlight games that work on Nvidia&rsquo;s streaming service. </p>

<p>At least that was the vibe I got at HP&rsquo;s Imagine AI event in New York City last week, where HP personnel were talking up the current AI PC technologies and teasing what&rsquo;s to come in the AI PC space later this year.</p>



<p>&ldquo;This is one of the biggest, most dynamic inflection points I&rsquo;ve ever seen in my career. There&rsquo;s stuff on the front burner in the AI category coming soon, even later this year, including even more AI performance in consumer laptops and workstations,&rdquo; said Alex Thatcher, senior director of cloud client and AI experience at HP.</p>

<p>Today, you can ask Microsoft Copilot to draw an AI-generated image of a strawberry pie for free, right from within Windows. But if you want to do the same thing in Microsoft Word, it will cost you at least 26 dollars per month. Does that make sense to you?</p>



<p>AI art has existed within Microsoft&rsquo;s ecosystem since 2022, when Microsoft released its first beta of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1358985/this-is-what-microsofts-new-ai-art-generator-will-look-like.html">Microsoft Bing Image Creator</a>.
