Last year both&#160;Gannett&#160;and&#160;Sports Illustrated&#160;were caught creating fake, “AI” generated journalists to create fake, plagiarism and mistake-prone “journalism.” In both instances the kind of&#160;brunchlord executives that fail upward at these kind of dying media companies&#160;thought it would be great to replace real human journalism with automated junk — without informing their actual human employees. &#8220;AI&#8221; (not [&#8230;]

The city of Chicago&#8217;s Inspector General is back at it, pointing out things are very, very wrong with the Chicago Police Department. Not that anyone needed any reminders. A long history of disinterest in disciplining misbehaving officers has led to everything from an off-the-books black site operation to more than 100 misconduct charges being racked [&#8230;]

It’s pretty rare to see a judge disqualify a law firm from taking on a case. But Judge William Alsup has done just that, disqualifying the litigation powerhouse law firm Quinn Emanuel from representing ExTwitter in a big data scraping case. We wrote about this case back in May, highlighting both the importance and complexities [&#8230;]

Back in 2022, a federal court responded to a challenge of a geofence warrant with some good questions. But its ultimate ruling was a shrug. A geofence warrant obtained by investigators searching for a bank robbery suspect covered a whole lot of ground, subjecting hundreds of innocent people to a search of their geolocation records.

A few years ago you might recall there was a three year news cycle about how the modern Trump GOP was somehow &#8220;serious about antitrust reform this time.&#8221; The party, which has never met a consolidated monopoly it didn&#8217;t adore (see: airlines, telecom, pharma, health, energy), was suddenly getting credited in the press for being [&#8230;]

While the vast majority of what I get to read about when it comes to intellectual property law generally, and trademark law specifically, makes me roll my eyes, the concept of geographic indicator trademarks actually isn&#8217;t one of them.
