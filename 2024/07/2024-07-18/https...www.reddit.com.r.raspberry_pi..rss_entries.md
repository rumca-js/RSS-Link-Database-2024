The setup is 2 ORICO 4 Bay Hard Drive Enclosure with 4 drives each. In each enclosure the drives are paired into software RAID1. After some time idling the first access to a drive in an enclosure takes 30 seconds, so if I access md0 it takes 30 seconds, but after that md0 and md1 perform great, and I have the same thing with md2 and md3.</p> <p>I'm hoping to figure out what exactly is being slow, I expect it is either the drives or the USB. I tried <code>hdparm -C</code> and smartctl showed power status unavailable. and it is slow the first time and seems to wake the drive first. I'm not sure how to check if USB devices might be sleeping, or if there is something else I should check.</p> <p>Any suggestions on diagnosing/confirming what is causing the 30 second wake time?
