Some of these games might be supremely addictive too, providing that sweet rush with every success. \n\nHowever, therein lies a problem with a lot of games; put simply, there are insurmountable roadblocks hampering that quest to 100%. Perhaps they\u2019re too challenging; maybe there\u2019s a significant number or objectives, many of which might be boring. Or maybe the time demands are too large; we simply don\u2019t have 100s of hours to plough into a game. This feature highlights 15 such games, taking care to avoid entries that can\u2019t be completed because of glitches or legacy achievements.\n\nThumbnail credit: Nexusmod user: 4Y4N", "id": 887372, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6NhJCJDn6E", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "source_obj__id": 129, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/t6NhJCJDn6E/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "15 MOST Addictive Games WE WILL NEVER COMPLETE", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
