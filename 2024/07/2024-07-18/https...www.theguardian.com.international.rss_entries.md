The rounds crashed through her living room window and tore through the bedroom wall of her 15-year-old daughter, who was spending the night at her cousin’s house.</p><p>Instinctively, Munoz ran to check on her five other children who were in the home with her. Thankfully, none of them were harmed. “Thank God my daughter wasn’t here,” Munoz, 35, said through a translator days later, as her children sat quietly in the living room. Bullet holes in the wall had recently been patched and the shattered front window had been covered up with plywood. “If she was home, she could have been killed.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jul/18/south-los-angeles-gun-violence-children">Continue reading...</a>
