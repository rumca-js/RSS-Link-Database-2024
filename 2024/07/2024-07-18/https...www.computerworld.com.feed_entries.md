<p>As Britain’s King Charles III stood up in the Houses of Parliament on Wednesday to present the new Labour government’s proposed legislative program, technology experts were primed for any mention of artificial intelligence (AI).</p>



<p>In the event, amidst the colorful pomp and arcane ceremony the British state is famous for in the state opening of Parliament, what the speech delivered was mostly <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/the-kings-speech-2024">a promise</a> of future legislation shorn of any detail on the form this will take.</p>
