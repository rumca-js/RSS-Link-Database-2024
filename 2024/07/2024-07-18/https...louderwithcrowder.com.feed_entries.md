## Watch: Joe Biden's BET interview was such a disaster, just ask his Defense Secretary "the black man"

Some guys have no luck.</p><p>Keep in mind, while this latest Biden disaster was unfolding, elsewhere at the RNC Convention they were reminiscing about one of his biggest disasters.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-medi
