Paramount+ has officially cancelled its divisive live-action Halo television series, with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paramount-releases-halo-tv-show-second-season-trailer">recently broadcast second season</a> set to be its last on the service.
</p><p>
Season 1 of Paramount+'s Halo series aired back in 2022, nearly a decade after the project was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spielberg-to-produce-a-halo-tv-show">first announced</a>. It launched to a mixed reception, however, drawing criticism for its writing, inconsistent tone, uneven plotting, and pacing. Halo fans also didn't love the decision to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paramounts-halo-reveals-master-chiefs-face">show Master Chief's face</a> just episodes in, or the decision to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-revealing-master-

Mortal Kombat developer NetherRealm Studios has been hit by layoffs according to affected members of staff, with the majority of job losses said to be from its mobile team.
</p><p>
News of the layoffs first surfaced after NetherRealm quality assurance analyst Tony Lazzara <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tony-lazzara-83b00319_opentowork-activity-7219362131924672513-snus/">posted to LinkedIn</a>, writing, "Unfortunately, yesterday NetherRealm's mobile team was shut down. A ton of very talented people were put out of work."
</p><p>
"We had live services on multiple titles such as Mortal Kombat Mobile, Injustice 2, and Mortal Kombat Onslaught," Lazzara continued. "I was also affected."

As Diablo 4's Vessel of Hatred expansion inches ever-closer, Blizzard has shared first gameplay and details for its new Spiritborn class during a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjVUD8eLCFY">lengthy deep-dive livestream</a>.
</p><p>
In lore terms, the Spiritborn comes from the jungles of Sanctuary's Nahantu and is described as "an apex predator with a deep connection to the spirit realm". From a gameplay perspective, though, the Spiritborn is a dexterity focused class built around a spirit-infused martial arts move set - combining aspects of Muay Thai, taekwondo, karate, kickboxing, and boxing - that promises to make for Diablo 4's "fastest, most aggressive" class yet.
</p><p>
It has multiple gap-closers built into its basic attacks, several movement skills with "very high damage", plus various ways to upgrade

Ubisoft has announced delays for Rainbow Six Mobile and The Division Resurgence, its two upcoming free-to-play mobile shooters, as part of its latest <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/3J1aM8p3bRqk3oSBRQPkFY/e2642b7dafe168b5c4ebb4acc9006f5f/Ubisoft_FY25_Q1_Sales_EN_vFinal.pdf">first-quarter earnings report</a>, which is says marks a "solid start" to the current financial year.
</p><p>
Rainbow Six Mobile and The Division Resurgence - a 5v5 competitive FPS and third-person, open-world "shooter RPG", respectively - were both originally due to launch some time before the end of its current financial year on 31st March 2025. However, the publisher has now delayed both games out of that window to give their development teas the "necessary time to ensure that these experiences deliver on expectations with optimised K

Ahead of the launch of Suicide Squad's second season, Rocksteady has detailed the playstyle of Mrs. Freeze.
</p><p>
We've known of her existence already thanks to a roadmap, but now her unique traversal abilities have been revealed in a <a href="https://www.suicidesquadgame.com/en-us/community/season-of-frozen-hearts-available-july-25">new blog post for Season of Frozen Hearts</a>, as well as more about the Frozen Elseworld environment.
</p><p>
If you've seen Frozone from Pixar's The Incredibles film then you'll have an idea of what to expect from Mrs. Freeze, who can use her Ice Path to glide over land and through the air with ease. She can also create loops and platforms to dash around battles and shoot enemies from above.

Splitgate developer 1047 Games has today said it will launch the sequel to its surprise hit indie shooter in 2025. 
</p><p>
The original Splitgate racked up 22m downloads, and received a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splitgate-review-the-appliance-of-science">positive reception to its mix of fast-paced Halo-esque combat with the ability to traverse portals, Portal style</a>.
</p><p>
Splitgate 2's pitch is clear. All of the above, but now with a bigger budget and with a much larger roster of veteran development talent - including people who worked on Halo back in the day.

This is a strategy game whose core is pure Capcom action, with energetic katana arcs and dazzling button combos laced with some of the most spectacular, kaleidoscopic visual effects this side of Okami (a connection that's not lost on Capcom either, thanks to their free Ammy and Waka costume <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-demo-available-now-okami-collaboration-announced">crossover items</a> coming today for launch).</p><p>As Soh's sword careens through the air with his dance-like moveset, he leaves twisting trails of colour behind him, like he'

## Steam is massive, but far fewer people work at Valve than you might think

Court documents have revealed detailed employment statistics for Valve, the company behind ubiquitous PC storefront Steam, the Steam Deck handheld, and - still - a team <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/now-theres-leaked-footage-of-valves-new-game-deadlock">dedicated to game development</a>. 
</p><p>
How many people work on the world's most-used PC game store and launcher? As of 2021, just 79. Valve's hardware team stood at just 41 people as of the same year, a fraction of its games team which employed 181 people. A further 35 staff were described as being employed in "admin" roles. 
</p><p>
Altogether, that's just 371 people employed by Valve in 2021, for a company believed to bring in around $6.5bn a year. EA, home to FIFA/FC, which also generates around $6.5bn annually, had 13,700 staff on the payroll this year.

To celebrate today's launch of Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess, Capcom has released a video performance of a traditional Japanese theatre show detailing its story.
</p><p>
It's performed by the National Bunraku Theatre, an Osaka-based company celebrating its 40th anniversary this year. Bunraku theatre combines narrative recitation, puppetry, and music, dating back to the Edo period from 1603 to 1868.
</p><p>
The performance is a tribute to the new game, which is steeped in Japanese folklore.

"The feedback we got from the community in Volta is that they felt like they were missing out on Ultimate Team, on Clubs, when they were going to Volta," senior producer Sam Rivera said. "People were not engaging as much as we initially thought, so we did a big exercise of 'learnings': what's happening with Volta, what are the numbers telling us, what's the community telling us?"</p><p>The result is Rush, and the change in how it's described by EA - as a "gameplay experience" rather than standalone m

While the world waits for news on Switch 2, there's still life in Nintendo's current aging console yet - and money to be made - as evidenced by the reveal of a Joy-Con Charging Stand.
</p><p>
Nintendo made the announcement via social media this morning, with word the device was officially dubbed the Joy-Con Charging Stand (Two-Way) accessory, and would be available to buy from 17th October. 
</p><p>
How much will it cost? For now, Nintendo is keeping that rather crucial detail to itself.

This is weird, really, because Renaud looks like hard work. He dresses like Blade and he speaks entirely in maxims. He's the best of the slayers and he can't wait to tell you about it.</p><p>But Renaud has a gift for me. He'll unlock a combo meter if I spend an evening hanging out with him. And I just love combo meters. Dungeons of Hinterberg's is particularly good. Slice slice slice and the numbers go up, as does your attack and your defence. It's a nice way to do more damage while feeling more competent. It's worth an evening lost to awkward chat to get that.</p><p>This is Dungeons of Hinterberg in microcosm. The game is set in an Alpine spa town where the local economy turns on the presence of magic. P
