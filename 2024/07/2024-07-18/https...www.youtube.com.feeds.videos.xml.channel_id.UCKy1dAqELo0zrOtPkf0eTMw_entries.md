Better late than never, right? Nintendo has unveiled its latest accessory to the Switch: a charging stand for your Joy-Con. This would've been great...maybe at launch? And it's not like the Switch was in desperate need for a charging stand—Hori makes a pretty good one AND it's an officially licensed Nintendo product. The kicker? The Hori stand charges four Joy-Con at once, while Nintendo's only does two. In other news, Sony may have accidentally leaked the latest Helldivers 2 Warbond themselves, and Splitgate, a cult favorite from the late-PS4 era, is getting a sequel.

On this episode, host Dana Schwartz (Noble Blood) talks with the cast and creators of the Peacock Original Series Those About To Die about bringing ancient Rome to life. Names like Vespasian, Titus and Domitian are instantly recognizable, locations like the Circus Maximus and the Colosseum loom and the gritty underbelly of Roman society feels familiar…and also alien, all at the same time. 
With that history in mind, it felt important for this first episode of Rise or Die to zero in on the historical inspiration for the series. Why was 79 CE the perfect year to set Those About To Die in? To find out, we spoke to series director and executive producer, Roland Emmerich (Independence Day, The Patriot) about what drew him to this specific chapter of Roman history. We also talk with series production designer Johannes Mueke, and actors Iwan Rheon and Sara Martins.

Check out the trailer for Lady in the Lake, an upcoming series starring Natalie Portman as Maddie Schwartz and Moses Ingram as Cleo Johnson. Lady in the Lake premieres July 19 on Apple TV+

When the disappearance of a young girl grips the city of Baltimore on Thanksgiving 1966, the lives of two women converge on a fatal collision course. Maddie Schwartz (Natalie Portman) is a Jewish housewife seeking to shed a secret past and reinvent herself as an investigative journalist, and Cleo Johnson (Moses Ingram) is a mother navigating the political underbelly of Black Baltimore while struggling to provide for her family. Their disparate lives seem parallel at first, but when Maddie becomes fixated on Cleo’s mystifying death, a chasm opens that puts everyone around them in danger. 

From visionary director Alma Har’el, Lady in the Lake emerges as a feverish noir thriller and an unexpected tale of the price women pay for their dreams.
