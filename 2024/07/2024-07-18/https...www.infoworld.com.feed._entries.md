<p>GitLab could be heading for an acquisition — and if it is, that could have consequences for the DevSecOps platform’s feature set and pricing, analysts say.</p>



<p>DevSecOps, the application development practice that automates the integration of security and security practices into every phase of the software development lifecycle, has become increasingly important as enterprises work to incorporate security into their DevOps processes. And DevOps platforms have been responding, adding the all-important “sec” to their products.</p>



<p>That, in turn, makes companies providing these tools more attractive to potential acquirers.</p>

<p>With .NET 9, currently <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/9.0">available in preview</a>, we now have three caching options in ASP.NET Core. <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/performance/caching/hybrid?view=aspnetcore-9.0">HybridCache</a> is a new library that addresses the shortcomings of in-memory caching and distributed caching.
