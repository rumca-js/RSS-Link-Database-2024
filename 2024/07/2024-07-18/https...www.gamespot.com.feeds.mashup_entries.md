<p>When I moved to the United States, my parents bought their first Mac: an iBook G4. It was an absolutely devastating choice for me, personally, as it meant that I would not be able to play the newly released RTS game Lord of the Rings: Battle for Middle-earth, a title it had felt like I had been waiting a Third Age to play.</p><p dir="ltr">Now, 20 years later, Apple's gaming prospects look a lot different. Not only did the Mac move from a Power PC processor to Intel, it has now left <em>those</em> chips in the dust as well for Apple's own silicon. And of course, the iPhone launched, which not only revolutionized the mobile phone landscape, but the gaming industry as well; hundreds of millions of people have played titles like Candy Crush and Angry Birds.</p><p dir="ltr">At a showcase of games and devices that Apple put on for media last week in New York City, I got a chance to check out a selection of titles across the company's various hardware options, which put the reality of App

## Kunitsu-Gami: Path Of The Goddess Review - Danse Macabre

<p dir="ltr">At first glance, Kunitsu-Gami: Path Of The Goddess feels like the spinning plates metaphor made manifest. Each stage requires you to purge supernatural rot, rescue villagers, build traps, and fight off waves of hideous demons, all with the goal of aiding a divine maiden in her quest to rid Mt. Kafuku of a plague. The gameplay mechanics required to achieve all of those tasks, however, bundle together to create one of the more distinct experiences in video games this year.</p><p dir="ltr">On a moment-to-moment basis, Kunitsu-Gami tests your fighting skills, as well as your wits and your ability to think on your feet, lest the maiden in your care succumb to the rot. There are elements where the fun of its sword-swinging, demon-slaying action is supplanted by menial tasks, but those hiccups aren't enough to derail the whole experience. Kunitsu-Gami is a refreshing new addition to Capcom's stable of IP and a solid execution of an engaging gameplay loop.</p><p dir="ltr">This ne

<p>As more metroidvania games come out, we're seeing fewer of them resemble the originators of the subgenre--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/super-metroid/">Super Metroid</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/castlevania-symphony-of-the-night/">Castlevania: Symphony of the Night</a>--and more that clearly take inspiration from those that came after. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/bo-path-of-the-teal-lotus/">Bō: Path of the Teal Lotus</a> is one such example, with tons of clear parallels to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hollow-knight/">Hollow Knight</a> in terms of both gameplay and narrative. In a few ways, this works extremely well for Path of the Teal Lotus--if you're going to take inspiration from a game, do it using one where there's a lot of good stuff to build on. However, Path of the Teal Lotus pales in comparison to its inspirations by making mechanics and features that were already problems in Hollow Knight, like an unclear map and frustra

<p dir="ltr">The original Twister is an archetypal '90s blockbuster, alongside stuff like Independence Day and Armageddon. A tornado might seem a little mundane next to those other flicks, but Twister delivered the same level of thrill even so. 30 years later, there are a lot of potential ways to update this weather-oriented flick for a modern audience, particularly as man-made climate change continues to ramp up. But Twisters just goes with the most straightforward approach available: Update the particulars, but still hit basically all the same beats as the original movie.</p><p dir="ltr">Fortunately, it's a fun and well-made movie, and it's got a great cast. It will entertain you from beginning to end. But since it also plays things so safely, it's not that memorable. It's a cotton candy movie--it tastes great, but you're not really getting anything out of it. But that's hardly the worst thing a movie could be.</p><p dir="ltr">Since Twisters follows its predecessor's template, it op

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/">Diablo 4</a> launched with only returning classes from past entries to choose from, all instantly familiar to fans of fantasy RPGs: Barbarian, Rogue, Sorcerer, Necromancer, and Druid. One class that was notably missing was a Paladin-type--some kind of holy warrior to dole out divine punishment to demons and evildoers in kind. Many fans expected Diablo 4's first expansion would look to fill that gap in the base game's roster.

<p>In Minecraft, a Beacon is a block that allows players to gain helpful status effects when paired with a pyramid. It can also help players find their base, as the Beacon shines a beam directly into the sky. To see the entire crafting process for the Beacon in Minecraft, check out the guide below.</p><h2>Making a Beacon in Minecraft</h2><p>While the Beacon does require some easy materials for its recipe, it's certainly not considered an early-game item in Minecraft. It only becomes useful after players create a pyramid made of different metals and features one mid-late game resource that's quite difficult to come by. You can see the exact crafting recipe for the Beacon below.</p><h3>Beacon crafting recipe</h3><ul><li>Place five Glass blocks, three across the top row of a crafting table and two on either side of the middle box</li><li>Place a Nether Star in the middle box</li><li>Fill out the crafting table with three Obsidian blocks</li></ul><figure style="width: 2560px;"><a href="ht

<p>Raising animals in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/stardew-valley/">Stardew Valley</a> will require you to have the appropriate building for it, like the barn. Having a barn allows you to raise cows, which reliably provide milk, so long as you take care of them. But if you really want to maximize the value of your barn animals, you will want to upgrade the structure. Upgrading the barn unlocks new animals, increases the number of animals you can have, an auto-feed feature, and more. Here are the details on how to upgrade from the base barn to the Big Barn and Deluxe Barn.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Every barn upgrade</h2><figure style="width: 1280px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4336042-barn.jpg"><img alt="The fully upgraded barn can hold up to 12 animals." src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4336042-barn.jpg" /></a><figcaption>The fully upgraded barn can hold up to 12 animals.</figcaption></figure><h3>Base Barn</h3><p
