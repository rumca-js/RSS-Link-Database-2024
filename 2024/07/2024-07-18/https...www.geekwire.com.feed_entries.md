That&#8217;s the gist of the company&#8217;s response to a media snowball effect that misinterpreted the elimination of two diversity and inclusion roles on its events team — yes, two positions — as the axing of its entire diversity and inclusion team. For the record, Microsoft says, that larger corporate D&#38;I team remains intact. It&#8217;s formally known as the Microsoft Global Talent, Development, Diversity and Inclusion (GTDDI) team, led by Lindsay-Rae McIntyre, chief diversity officer. Business Insider reported in its original story July 15 that Microsoft laid off &#8220;a DEI team,&#8221; noting&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/microsoft-di-cuts-impact-two-positions-company-says-main-team-and-larger-goals-remain-intact
