  <p id="0alO5j">HBO’s <em>Dune</em> prequel series now has a premiere date — or month, at least. The upcoming show, called <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24157282/dune-prophet-prequel-series-max-trailer"><em>Dune: Prophecy</em></a>, will hit both HBO and Max in November. The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/11/24196475/wbd-hbo-originals-max-the-penguin-dune-prophecy">HBO Original</a> also got a fresh teaser, which makes it look like the six-episode-long show will be filled with plenty of political maneuvering.</p>

  <p id="Gj9Wyh">OpenAI is releasing a lighter, cheaper model for developers to tinker with called GPT-4o Mini. It costs significantly less than full-sized models and is said to be more capable than GPT-3.5.</p>
<p id="xevdEa">Building apps using OpenAI’s models can rack up a huge bill. Developers without the means to afford to tinker with it can get priced out of it entirely and may opt for cheaper models like Google’s Gemini 1.5 Flash or Anthropic’s Claude 3 Haiku. Now, OpenAI is entering the light model game.</p>
<p id="qvKEuw">“I think GPT-4o Mini really gets at the OpenAI mission of making AI more broadly accessible to people. If we want AI to benefit every corner of the wor
