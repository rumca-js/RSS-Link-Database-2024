<p>Today's post marks the beginning of a month long project of building and painting my first Spearhead for the new edition of Age of Sigmar. Every week, I'll paint a new unit and add it to the collection. First up, it's the Stormcast Eternals Liberators. Stay around until the end of this post where I share my painting guide for Sigmar's bulwark troops.</p>
