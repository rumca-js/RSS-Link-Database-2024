Well, almost.</p><p>On Thursday we got to see a rather different Ed at the Post Office Inquiry. One that had been kept well away from public consumption. This was, at times, a Shifty Ed.

<p>Wage dysmorphia is common among those who, like me, have developed a scarcity mindset – but it stops us from thriving</p><p>Recently, for the first time in my life, I paid to upgrade myself to business class on a flight. It felt exhilarating to spend money frivolously and treat myself to a more comfortable flight. It was decadent, and worth every penny.</p><p>The upgrade was $180 (£139) and I could have afforded it even if it had been $1,000, but I struggle to justify that kind of expense. As a freelance journalist I usually make between $30,000 and $55,000 a year, and I’ve managed to save over six figures. Still, I’ve struggled with a lifelong sense of financial insecurity.

<p>He gave fans moments of pint-launching euphoria but it’s time to find a manager who can achieve the ultimate dream</p><p>Southgate has earned the right to decide when he leaves given his record. He’s taken us far in tournaments but it’s the stakes rather than the style of football which has brought excitement. Right now I’d take some front-foot football over being runners-up at a major tournament, even if that means going back to crashing out at the round of 16. I think his success should partly be measured in the seeds that have been sown for future England managers. The penalty win against Switzerland at the Euros was my best moment. There was a redemptive quality to it that had roots going as deep as the manager’s miss in 1996. Cathartic. Of the names the bookies are running with, I’d happily take Mauricio Pochettino or Thomas Tuchel.

That said, I don’t like to overcomplicate them – instead, I let the ingredients speak for themselves, such as in this courgette, feta and red onion number, which is perfect on a picnic blanket with a good, crunchy salad and cold white wine.

Their single <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRD0-GxqHVo">Heat Waves</a> was certainly the biggest-selling track in the world: it spent six weeks in May that year at the top of Billboard’s Global 200 chart and wound up the second-biggest song of the year overall, beaten only by Harry Styles’ As It Was. No song has ever spent longer than Heat Waves on the US singles chart (91 weeks). In Australia it enjoyed a staggering 86 weeks in the Top 10. It went multi-platinum in 17 countries.</p><p>It’s all the more surprising because Glass Animals are a band who – to borrow Peter Cook’s waspish old line about David Frost – rose without trace.

<p>His near assassination transformed Trump’s theology, giving the decidedly earthly ex-president a powerful spiritual sheen</p><p>The attempted assassination of Donald Trump has transformed the theology of Trump.

<p>Judge Cannon acted like part of Trump’s defense team.

He kept them in basements, bathrooms and ballrooms; they were often unlocked, accessible to anyone who happened to wander by, as dozens or hundreds of people do, every day, at Mar-a-Lago.

<p>The transition from violence to political change is explored in this novel of betrayal and brutality in Northern Ireland</p><p>“Everyone knew Francie and Francie knew everyone. He was at the centre of everything and he knew everything.” So the long-serving IRA man Francie Begley is described by slippery politician Máirtín O’Cuilleanáin in Austin Duffy’s riveting and gritty Troubles novel, Cross. Set in&nbsp;1994, in the months before the provisional ceasefire, the book takes its title from the fictional northern Irish border town of Cross, an outpost in “so-called bandit country ... this hotbed of republicanism”. Duffy dramatises the tortuous shift from violence to real political change in the front rooms and pubs of Cross, with the two wings of the republican cause embodied by Francie and O’Cuilleanáin. It’s no accident that O’Cuilleanáin is known as MOC by the paramilitaries, with its echo of “master of ceremonies”; he’s the one pulling the strings in Westminster and Stormont.</p

You had to recite the pledge of allegiance at the start of every day and all the kids seemed more confident and outgoing.”</p><p>She was being hosted by one of the teachers at the school, who had a daughter a few years younger than Joanna.

What always struck, and scared, me as a teenager was just how hopeless things then felt – an aborted mission to throw it off course, a limited and unjust lottery for some to stay safe in shelters, a host of horrible choices to be made – with so much of the film then haunted by

<p>A horse riding accident left Georgie Brayshaw in a coma at 15. Now 30, she is taking aim at Olympic gold</p><p>“Georgina? Hello? Georgina?” Georgie Brayshaw is parked on a roadside somewhere in Switzerland, in Berne, she thinks, and pressed into the back window trying to get better reception. “How’s Switzer …” The line drops. “… id you say? You cut …” And drops again. “How’s Switz …” A lorry passes. “… raining a lot.” Brayshaw, 30, is on her way back from the World Rowing Cup II in Lucerne with the rest of the GB women’s quadruple sculls team. They won gold, again, just like they did at the world championships in Belgrade last year, and the Europeans in Szeged earlier this one.</p><p>At the time of this interview, she has 60 days to get ready for the Olympics, when, although she would never say it, the team will be favourites to win gold again. But Brayshaw takes life one thing at a time, and before all that, she has a long drive to finish, a ferry to catch and, right now, a story

<p>Food that packs and shares well: fingers at the ready for a Balkan filo picnic pie and fried tofu in a tangy sauce served in lettuce cups</p><p>The scene might<em> </em><em>seem </em>spontaneous and relaxed to passersby, but if you’re having a picnic, you need to have a plan. There are rules! And here are mine: the food needs to transport well (obviously), it must not wilt or go soggy, and it must be communal. You’ll need a bread knife, too, for slicing things, but, if you can, do without individual cutlery, because it’s lovely to eat with your hands. Swigging from a bottle is not so great, however, so cups are always welcome. Don’t feel compelled to pack carrot sticks, hummus or baguettes, though, because experience tells me that others will bring at least four times more of all of those than anyone can eat. And delight in food that crumbles – on a picnic, crumbs don’t matter!</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/article/2024/jul/18/yotam-ottolenghi-picnic-recipes-balkan-

<p>A woman is haunted by her traumatic Australian childhood – and her dead boyfriend – in a darkly funny novel that hints at hope</p><p>Max, a thirtysomething creative writing tutor, has died, and now haunts the second-floor flat in London’s Tulse Hill where he once lived with his Australian girlfriend, Hannah. This is inconvenient, as Max doesn’t believe in ghosts, and yet here he is, watching Hannah grieve, “floating about like a jellyfish, my tendrils … sweeping up the lint and hair from the floor. Sometimes when I come forth I take up the whole of a room, like a balloon slotted between ribs and blown up to make a space for breath.” Notice that funny, mysterious “come forth”, and the near-violence of the simile that follows (“slotted between ribs”): this is not going to be a quirky-sad love story, all poignant memories and hard-won insights.
