<p>The world of Middle-earth is far more expansive than the tales of The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit. While Frodo, Gandalf, Samwise, Bilbo, and Gollum might be some of the most familiar faces to Middle-earth fans, J.R.R. Tolkien masterfully built his fantasy world with a staggering level of detail and lore--all of which can explored in The History of Middle-earth series. Compiled and edited from Tolkien's manuscripts and notes by his son Christopher Tolkien, The History of Middle-earth was originally published in the 1980s and '90s. Like all Tolkien books, it has received multiple reissues, but <a href="https://www.amazon.com/History-Middle-earth-Box-Set-Silmarillion/dp/0063379848?tag=gamespot-primeday-20">the 2024 editions</a> are certainly the most stunning thus far.</p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://www.amazon.com/History-Middle-earth-Box-Set-Silmarillion/dp/0063379848?tag=gamespot-primeday-20">Get Middle-earth book set for over 50 percent off
