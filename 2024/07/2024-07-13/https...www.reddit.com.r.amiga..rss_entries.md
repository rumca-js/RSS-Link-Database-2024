<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I recently came into possession of a number of Amiga games on floppy disks. Is there a site or any resource available that can tell me what originally came packaged with each game? None of these have the original boxes. Some I can tell because the disks are numbered 1of X, but the real trouble comes with extras such as guides or extra papers. Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Proper_Trouble8191"> /u/Proper_Trouble8191 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1e2ftkk/any_resources_for_finding_what_came_packed_in/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1e2ftkk/any_resources_for_finding_what_came_packed_in/">[comments]</a></span>
