  <p id="pab02r">There’s a bit of a theme of payoff in this week’s trailers. Anthony Mackie finally takes the lead on the big screen after 10 years in the MCU; Ridley Scott’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/09/11/ridley-talks-gladiator-2">two-decade-plus plan</a> for a <em>Gladiator</em> sequel is coming to fruition; and we finally get to find out what happens next to the macrodata refinement team in <em>Severance. </em></p>
<p id="U4TmD4">There’s a lot to go through this week, from big-budget tentpole movies to whimsical TV, so let’s get down to it, starting, naturally, with the MCU.</p>

  <p id="rdxS7u">Valve is a famously secretive company with an enormous influence on the gaming industry, particularly because it runs the massive PC gaming storefront Steam. But despite that influence, Valve isn’t a large organization on par with EA or Riot Games’ thousands of employees: according to leaked data we’ve seen, as of 2021, Valve employed just 336 staffers.</p>
