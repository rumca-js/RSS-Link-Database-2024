It's not bad \u2013 there are far worse survival crafting games with less enjoyable gameplay loops and more grinding. \n\nThe mashing of multiple different titles and genres, from looter shooters to horror and MMOs, is easy to get lost in, despite the wild tonal shifts. That feeling of mimicking other, superior games is present, like with The First Descendant, but at least the lore and cosmic horror aspects have something to them. \n\nFor now, it could use more original ideas, revamp its blueprint system, better story-telling, etc. alongside more features and quality-of-life changes.", "id": 858118, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUjNaDJ-NYA", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "source_obj__id": 129, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/kUjNaDJ-NYA/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Once Human Review - The Final Verdict", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
