<p>The chance to follow the heroes of 1966 is within team’s grasp but there is no room for fear against Spain in final</p><p>When Gareth Southgate watches his players walk out at the Olympiastadion on Sunday night, he will trust them to finish the job. If England expects then this time belief rather than entitlement is the cause. A squad that has spent the past four weeks walking through fire and somehow emerging unscathed is ready. In Berlin, where England face Spain in a Euro 2024 final that pits process-driven Southgateism against possession football mixed with devastating wing play, there is no room for fear.</p><p>Instead, as the chance to follow the heroes of 1966 into sporting immortality beckons, the sense is of a group hardened by previous disappointments. Southgate can feel it when he looks at the old-timers.

Outside the security cordon a delegation of suits and some obvious muscle are discussing provisions for the arrival of a dignitary, described euphemistically as “a member of the FA board” (ie its president, Prince William). Twenty yards away, meanwhile, stands a removal van plastered in massive pictures of Kieran Trippier and the message “Bury boys on Tour”. It contains seven lads who are scoping out the arena but also bemoaning the fact they slept in the van the night before: “It stank like anything in the morning.”</p><p>Everybody wants to be in Berlin for the game – be they Prince, punter, or prime minister.

<p>Longlegs, released last week, is a beautiful and complex film that highlights how far the genre has evolved</p><p></p><p>There’s nothing I find so cheering, these days, as the rise of the horror movie. Take its intrusion into this year’s summer blockbusters. We have the usual soulless franchises and deadly repeats – <em>Despicable Me 4</em>, <em>Deadpool&nbsp;3</em>, <em>Furiosa: A Mad Max </em><em>Saga</em>, <em>Bad Boys: Ride or Die</em> – and then we have a flicker of light in the dark. Turns out that audiences do want new stories, they do want new characters, and they do want inventive film-making after all. Because a genuinely imaginative – arthouse, even – movie is predicted to draw in big audiences and make a great deal of money. It has come in the form of a horror film: <em>Longlegs</em>.</p><p>Just released on Friday and starring Nicolas Cage as a serial killer, <em>Longlegs</em> has been reviewed, variously, as “<a href="https://www.flickeringmyth.com/longlegs-is-the-scar

From there began a two-year collaboration entitled <em>A Time a Place</em>, which pairs every European Car of the Year over the past 60 years with a building of the same vintage. “The project aims to present everyday vehicles that used to be a common sight on our roads but have now all but disappeared, against architecture that has survived,” says Holroyd. Beginning with the 1964 Rover P6 outside the Crystal Palace sports centre, it includes a Fiat 124 in front of a Coventry tower block and a Porsche 928 outside the Sainsbury Centre in Norwich. “That first shoot was a real test for us both,” says Hopkinson. “

<p>Being thrust into the spotlight as a teen is tough but Spain’s diamond is shining at Euro 2024</p><p>A lot is being made of Lamine Yamal being a prodigious 17-year-old at the Euros but by the time the final against England kicks off on Sunday, he will be an old hand after celebrating his 17th birthday on Saturday. He has already come of age by mixing playground football with decision-making beyond his years. Like Lamine Yamal, I made my first-team debut while still at school – I was 14 when I was fast-tracked by Birmingham City. Some might see it as a daunting prospect to be brought into an adult environment while most people of the same age are worrying about exams but, and I know it sounds weird, I believe it is the best time to move up to elite football.</p><p>I played in a European Championship when I was 17, scoring an injury-time winner against Finland in front of a huge crowd, and it was pure excitement to be part of the national team at such a young age.

In his day job, he’s a professor of ethics at New York University’s Stern School of Business. But outside academia, he’s a compelling campaigner.

<p>Brussels’ AfricaMuseum, founded to glorify a brutal project, faces demands for restitution of exquisite treasures stolen from Belgian Congo</p><p>For years, the lustrous copper and glass necklace was on display at the Royal Museum for Central Africa in Tervuren, east of Brussels. Reputed to have belonged to a notorious 19th-century trader of enslaved people, it has 10 bright gilded copper beads suspended on silk, with red glass “jewels” on an intricate medallion. But nobody really knew how the jewellery from central Africa came to be in Belgium.</p><p>The museum first registered the necklace in 1959. A decade earlier, a Greek resident of the former Belgian Congo tried unsuccessfully to sell it to the museum. He had acquired it from an anonymous Belgian mechanic, who in turn had bought it from a Congolese chief – or so the archives said.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/13/belgium-museum-wrestles-with-colonial-past-with-40000-objects-tainted-with-viole

She is 25 years old, and when she got involved with the party some years ago – standing as a councillor in 2019 – she was a teenage mother living in temporary accommodation.

Most people in her age group do not share this view: just 8% of people under 25 voted Conservative on 4 July. In 2019, it was 21%. With so few in their age group

<p>If Trump is re-elected, and a Republican Congress hands him a federal abortion ban, does anyone think he’d veto it?</p><p>The <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/08/trump-abortion-republican-platform/">press</a> has pointed to the near erasure of the word <em>abortion</em> from the new Republican platform as evidence that the mind and soul of the Republican party now resides in the body of Donald J Trump. The document omits the right’s top-priority goal of a federal abortion ban and replaces it with Trump’s preference to let the states do the dirty work. Missing too is the holy grail of the antiabortion movement: a “human life amendment,” which would extend to fetuses and embryos the constitutional protections that were seized from pregnant people when the supreme court overturned Roe v Wade in June 2022.</p><p>The consensus is that the changes from the 2016 platform, which was used in the 2020 elections, to the 2024 version subordinate the Republican party’s l

<p>England midfielder is parking talk of celebratory haircuts or tattoos as he prepares to confront Spain in Berlin</p><p>The question was put to Declan Rice: what memento would he choose for winning Euro 2024? Perhaps, like some of his teammates, he could get on board with the idea of a celebratory tattoo. Maybe a radical deployment of hair dye could bring something snazzier and less permanent. Instead Rice reached straight for the deadpan. “I don’t want to jinx anything because I feel like we’ve done that in the World Cup and the last Euros,” he said. “When things don’t go your way you end up thinking: ‘Why did we speak about things before they even happen?’ One more game, then we can talk about silly haircuts and tattoos.”</p><p>Rice did not want to appear a killjoy or, as he put it, “be robotic”. England have been burned before. They are so close now and it owes plenty to the drive and relentless focus of a player who sets the tempo in Gareth Southgate’s engine room. “With me, wha

Gallagher sprints somewhere else. We’ve played seven minutes of the five to be added on. Unai Simón launches one forward. The green-bibbed Adam Wharton and Lewis Dunk are virtually on the pitch. They think it’s all over. The referee raises his arms and blows his whistle. Kobbie Mainoo sinks to the turf. Bukayo Saka gleams. Jordan Pickford moves his limbs frantically at the same time. Jude Bellingham stands, arms outstretched, just nodding. Declan Rice and John Stones are embracing like Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman as the camera zooms away to the Pacific Ocean.

But this was no nature reserve, simply an ordinary Estonian country lane, close to the coast and the Lithuanian border.</p><p>I got back on the bike and pushed hard to get the pedals moving.
