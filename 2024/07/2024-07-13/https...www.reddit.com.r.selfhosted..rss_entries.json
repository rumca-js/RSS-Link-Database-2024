I also thought about renting an ec2 or perhaps an instance of lightsail, but if I were to get one with the same settings as my home server, it would cost almost 300 euros a month. I thought about taking the most basic instance of lightsail which provides me with a public IPv4 and using it to redirect the requests that arrive on it to my Home Server, but I was afraid because the most basic instance has a very low configuration.

I've kicked this can down the road several months and can continue to do so by manually deleting what I don't need but this has also given me the push to start self hosting instead of relying on these free (soon to be paid) cloud storage options. </p> <p>Is there a way for me to ease into this self hosting? Starting with Gmail? Is it possible to point Gmail at a home server? </p> <p>I have a technology background so I don't, yet, need help with getting that setup.
