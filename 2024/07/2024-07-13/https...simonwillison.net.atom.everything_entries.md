<p>If you have a project, an idea, a product feature, or anything else that you want other people to understand and have conversations about... give them something to link to!</p>
<p>Two illustrative examples are ChatGPT Code Interpreter and Boring Technology.</p>
<h4 id="chatgpt-code-interpreter-is-effectively-invisible">ChatGPT Code Interpreter is effectively invisible</h4>
<p><strong>ChatGPT Code Interpreter</strong> has been one of my favourite AI tools for over a year. It's the feature of ChatGPT which allows the bot to write <em>and then execute</em> Python code as part of responding to your prompts. It's incredibly powerful... and almost invisible! If you don't know how to use prompts to activate the feature you may not realize it exists.</p>
<p>OpenAI don't even have a help page for it (and it very desperately needs documentation) - if you search their site you'll find <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/tools/code-interpreter">confusing technical docs</a> abo

<blockquote cite="https://jacobian.org/2024/jul/12/lnt-for-engineering-leadership/"><p>We respect wildlife in the wilderness because we’re in <em>their</em> house. We don’t fully understand the complexity of most ecosystems, so we seek to minimize our impact on those ecosystems since we can’t always predict what outcomes our interactions with nature might have.</p>
<p>In software, many disastrous mistakes stem from not understanding why a system was built the way it was, but changing it anyway. It’s super common for a new leader to come in, see something they see as “useless”, and get rid of it – without understanding the implications. Good leaders make sure they understand before they mess around.</p></blockquote><p class="cite">&mdash; <a href="https://jacobian.org/2024/jul/12/lnt-for-engineering-leadership/">Jacob Kaplan-Moss</a></p>

Then, the commit with your change will update the tests. The diff between these commits represents the change in behavior. This helps the author test their tests (I've written tests thinking they covered the relevant case but didn't), the reviewer to more precisely see the change in behavior and comment on it, and the wider community to understand what the PR description is about.</p></blockquote><p class="cite">&mdash; <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40949229#40951540">Ed Page</a></p>

In particular, X prohibits eligible researchers from <strong>independently accessing</strong> its public data, such as by scraping, as stated in its terms of service. In addition, X's process to <strong>grant eligible researchers access to its application programming interface (API)</strong> appears to dissuade researchers from carrying out their research projects or leave them with no other choice than to pay disproportionally high fees.</p></blockquote><p class="cite">&mdash; <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_24_3761">European Commission</a></p>
