The NYT is fighting OpenAI\u2019s request to turn over reporters\u2019 notes, interview memos, and other materials used to produce stories, to prove they were worthy of copyright.&#160; On a related topic, we take a closer listen to Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman&#8217;s comments about AI and fair use at the Aspen Ideas Festival, which were more nuanced than some of the coverage&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2024/openai-wants-nyts-notes-ai-meets-email-startup-vets-power-up-an-ev-charging-marketplace/\">Read More</a>", "id": 859485, "language": "en-US", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2024/openai-wants-nyts-notes-ai-meets-email-startup-vets-power-up-an-ev-charging-marketplace", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 29, "page_rating_contents": 90, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed", "source_obj__id": 131, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "OpenAI wants NYT\u2019s notes; AI meets email; Startup vets power up an EV charging marketplace", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-07-13T13:00:00+00:00", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"945\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/echo-spot-1260x945.jpg\" width=\"1260\" /><br />Amazon&#8217;s original Echo Spot has been sitting on the back corner of the desk in my home office for seven years, since its release in 2017.
