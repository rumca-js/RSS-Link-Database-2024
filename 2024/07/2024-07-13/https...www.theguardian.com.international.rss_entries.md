<p>This refreshingly honest debut explores a south London family shaped by the pain of emotional neglect</p><p>Living can be a heavy business. No Small Thing, the debut novel by Orlaine McDonald, concerns itself with the accretive weight of thwarted desires, familial responsibilities and the relentless, life‑dominating grind of poorly paid labour. Slim and episodic, the novel tracks a year in the life of a south London family – grandmother Livia, daughter Mickey and granddaughter Summer – as they haltingly attempt to care for one another against a background of abandonment and resentment. Also present, in the broadest sense, is Meriem, the disembodied voice of Livia’s own mother, offering gnomic wisdom and serving as a reminder that since we tend to carry our dead with us, we may as well listen to them while we are at it.</p><p>Livia, by some distance the most compelling and well-drawn of the three principal characters, is a revelation.

Things have not started well, and we’re still a long way from Spain.</p><p>“Zones one through six only,” the guard says, in a weary, patronising sing-song.
