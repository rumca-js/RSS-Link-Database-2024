And for Emma Raducanu, this year’s Wimbledon is increasingly carrying echoes of the greatest moment of her young life.</p><p>Over the past few days the draw has opened up for the 21-year-old Briton like the Red Sea before Moses – just as it did when <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/sep/11/emma-raducanu-makes-tennis-history-with-us-open-final-win">she won the US Open</a> as a 1,000-1 outsider in 2021. Incredibly she is not scheduled to meet another seed until next Thursday’s semi-finals. On Friday, Raducanu also found Maria Sakkari barring her path – just as she did in New York. And once again she blasted her out of sight. The Greek was the ninth seed here but had no answer as Raducanu gave a display of counterpunching to make Floyd Mayweather purr before winning 6-2, 6-3 in 91 minutes.</

Like a pesky hound, he has gnawed at their ankles throughout their time in government. They tried various strategies: ignoring him, insulting him and throwing him bones – a referendum, a resignation, a new leader, a policy of sending asylum seekers to Rwanda. But rather than stop or sate him, these methods only made him stronger and louder, his appetite more ravenous.

<p>As the Police’s 1983 classic Synchronicity is reissued, their drummer will take on your questions</p><p>Bands like to end on a high, but few did it with as much panache as the Police. Having amassed increasing success since they formed in 1977, in 1983 the band issued their final album, Synchronicity – which was their biggest and, many would argue, best. It topped the charts in the UK and US, as did the single Every Breath You Take, and as well as being named one of the 500 greatest albums of all time by Rolling Stone, Synchronicity was selected last year by the US Library of Congress to be added to the National Recording Registry for being “culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant”.</p><p>On 26 July it will be reissued in multiple formats with varying degrees of lavishness, most notably a six-CD box with 55 previously unreleased tracks including demos, alternate mixes and unheard originals, and a live album recorded in Oakland in 1983.</p> <a href="https://www.thegua

<p>On its 15th anniversary, the creators of FarmVille reflect on the compulsive cartoon farm sim that paved the way for a data-driven world</p><p>Facebook users of a certain age may remember a particularly forlorn farm animal popping up in their feeds during the platform’s heyday. The lonely cow would wander into FarmVille players’ pastures with its face twisted into a frown and its eyes shimmering with tears. “She feels very sad and needs a new home,” an accompanying caption read, asking you to adopt the cow or message your friends for help. Ignore the cow’s plea and it would presumably be left friendless and foodless. Message your friends about it, and you’d be accelerating the spread of one of the biggest online crazes of the 2010s.</p><p>Released 15 years ago, FarmVille was nothing short of a phenomenon. More than 18,000 players gave it a go on its first day, rising to 1 million by its fourth. At its peak in 2010, more than 80 million users logged in monthly to plant crops, tend a

<p>I didn’t hear the others screaming. I felt as if I was in a bubble </p><p>One weekend in June two years ago, my friends Le’Annka, Nia and I were set to fly from Nassau, the capital of The Bahamas, to Long Island, just over 200 miles away. But our reservation got cancelled. We rebooked – that was also cancelled. We then chose to charter a&nbsp;plane. I was apprehensive – those planes are small. But Le’Annka read positive reviews of the pilot, so we decided to take a chance.</p><p>The weather that morning was perfect. My friends and I were excited. I was struck by how small the plane was. It was a seven-seater; we all sat up close to one another. But there was nothing to worry about: we were in the air and smoothly making our way over. In no time, we were soaking up the sun.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/article/2024/jul/05/experience-i-survived-a-plane-crash-without-a-scratch">Continue reading...</a>
