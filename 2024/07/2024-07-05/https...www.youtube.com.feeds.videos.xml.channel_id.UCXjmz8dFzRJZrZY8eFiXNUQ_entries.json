With stories that transcend time, language barriers, countries, and cultures, Studio Ghibli at one time made nothing but timeless classics.  Though when Hayao Miyazaki first stepped away, Studio Ghibli started to see it's first downturn in it's history.  It wasn't until Hayao Miyazaki came back to get the studio back on track and direct The Boy and the Heron that things started running like the old days.
