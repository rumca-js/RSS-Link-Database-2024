Two white dwarf stars collided, creating a temporary 'guest star,' now labeled supernova (SN) 1181, which was recorded in historical documents in Japan and elsewhere in Asia. However, after the star dimmed, its location and structure remained a mystery until a team pinpointed its location in 2021. Now, through computer modeling and observational analysis, researchers have recreated the structure of the remnant white dwarf, a rare occurrence, explaining its double shock formation. They also discovered that high-speed stellar winds may have started blowing from its surface within just the past 20-30 years. This finding improves our understanding of the diversity of supernova explosions, and highlights the benefits of interdisciplinary research, combining history with modern astronomy to enable new discoveries about our galaxy.", "id": 814993, "language": "en-us", "link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/07/240705101157.htm", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/rss/all.xml", "source_obj__id": 188, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Fresh wind blows from historical supernova", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-07-05T10:11:54+00:00", "description": "Researchers have now developed a new way to make microbes hardy enough to withstand extreme conditions such as heat and the manufacturing processes used to formulate the microbes into powders or pills for long-term storage.", "id": 814994, "language": "en-us", "link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/07/240705101154.htm", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/rss/all.xml", "source_obj__id": 188, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Engineers find a way to protect microbes from extreme conditions", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-07-05T10:11:47+00:00", "description": "Young, na ve starlings are looking for their wintering grounds independently of experienced conspecifics.
