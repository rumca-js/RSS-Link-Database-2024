On this week's episode of the podcast, freeCodeCamp founder Quincy Larson interviews Scott Hanselman. Scott's a developer at Microsoft, a prolific teacher, and has hosted the Hanselminutes podcast for nearly two decades.

We talk about:
· How he leads a fully-remote team from his home of Portland, Oregon
· His 11-year journey to getting his degree
· What he learned from teaching programming at community college
· What he's learned about software development from recording 980 podcast interviews across 20 years

Can you guess what song I'm playing on my bass during the intro? It's from a 1994 punk song.
