<p>Nature Materials, Published online: 05 July 2024; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41563-024-01949-2">doi:10.1038/s41563-024-01949-2</a></p>The generation of attosecond pulses has opened the door to probing electron dynamics at sub-atomic scales. Beyond atomic physics, this field is envisioned to also have a decisive impact on condensed-matter physics, chemistry and biology.
