<p>Any laptop with a GPU could be considered a gaming laptop, but it doesn&rsquo;t start to feel like a &ldquo;real&rdquo; gaming laptop until it starts pushing the limits&mdash;and I&rsquo;m not just talking about performance.</p>



<p>Gaming laptops have a reputation for going above and beyond, especially with regard to aesthetics: colorful lights, embellishments, and slick designs that borrow from sci-fi concepts. But all of that is icing on top of the desktop gaming experience in a laptop body.</p>



<p>In the history of over-the-top gaming laptops, a handful stand out as particularly iconic and/or innovative. Here are my picks for the best, most amazing, most ridiculous gaming laptops that guarantee gamer cred.</p>
