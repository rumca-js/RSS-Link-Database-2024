The two options presented are bats, which will occasionally leave fruit in the cave, or Mushrooms, which will occasionally spawn in the cave.

Come patch 1.4.4, a bug fix to a number of Legendary Aspects that "were not dealing as much damage as intended" will be applied, and lo and behold, the Dust Devil's Aspect is somehow on <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/diablo4/23964909/diablo-iv-patch-notes">Blizzard's list</a>. That means the already-powerful build will become even stronger, as the Dust Devils created by Whirlwind will deal even more damage. Other Aspects that will deal more damage following the fix include the Aspect of Surprise, Trickster's aspect, Aspect of Artful Initiative, Vengeful Aspect, and Aspect of the Arrow Storms.</p><p dir="lt

<p>Elden Ring got its latest patch and multiple nerfs have arrived for some of the Shadow of the Erdtree expansion's most-powerful weapons. To start, the arcane scaling of the Bloodfiend's Arm has been decreased and the status buildup associated with the weapon's heavy attack was also reduced. Pre-patch, the weapons Lightning Perfume Bottle and Frenzyflame Perfume Bottle occasionally dealt double damage, but that bug has now been repaired.</p><p>There are a few fixes in the patch that make weapons more powerful. The Carian Sorcery Sword got increased Intelligence scaling, but got worse base damage in turn. The patch repairs a bug where enemies would heal after Black Knife Tiche's maximum HP reduction/gradual HP reduction effect wore off.</p><p>The patch notes also address some performance issues, though it may require a little tinkering in your settings. For example, some PC versions might have ray tracing enabled by default. Check your graphics settings to turn it off. On PS5, you ca

<p>If you're looking to truly make your house or structure stand out in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/minecraft/">Minecraft</a>, then you want to go with <strong>Cherry Blossom wood</strong> for the design. However, Cherry Blossom trees are extremely rare and only spawn in their own specific biome. Below, you can see how to find that biome and everything else associated with Cherry Blossom in Minecraft.</p><h2>Finding the Cherry Blossom Biome in Minecraft</h2><p>The Cherry Blossom biome is difficult to miss once you're nearby, as it features bright pink trees and petals all over the ground. Unfortunately, the biome is usually incredibly small, meaning you'll have to look extremely hard for it in the overworld. To make your search simpler, you can look near mountains, as that's the most likely biome to be near Cherry Blossoms. However, the biome can spawn anywhere, so you might be searching for it for a while.</p><p>Unless you're willing to enable console commands, there's no

<p>The most common mode of transportation in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/minecraft/">Minecraft </a>is simply walking or running to your destination. While you can also ride a mount, which requires the use of a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-get-a-saddle-in-minecraft/1100-6524656/">saddle</a>, these methods are often too slow for eager players who want to get across the map in an instant. Fortunately, there is a way to teleport in Minecraft, but it requires some setup to accomplish.</p><h2>Teleporting in Minecraft</h2><p>First and foremost, teleporting is considered an unofficial act of cheating in Survival or Hardcore worlds. While teleporting won't get you officially banned by Mojang, the mode of transportation does require the use of console commands. If you're in a world by yourself or with some friends, this likely doesn't carry any weight. However, you won't be able to teleport if the admin of a world doesn't allow the use of console commands.</p><f

<p>The 2018 anime movie <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/batman-ninja-review-youve-never-seen-the-bat-like-/1100-6457667/">Batman Ninja</a> had one of the wildest takes on the Dark Knight in the hero's 85-year history. The film sent Batman, as well as most of his allies and villains, back in time for an epic battle in feudal Japan that included a mech piloted by Joker and an army of monkeys that merged into a giant samurai monkey that Batman could use against Joker's super-robot. Now, the first look at the sequel, Batman Ninja vs. Yakuza League, has arrived. And if the teaser trailer is any indication, Batman's return trip to feudal Japan will include an even more audacious take on some very familiar faces.</p><div>          </div><p>The Yakuza League appear to be Batman's allies in the Justice League who have somehow been transformed into villains.
