Sometimes it's better to work on a lot of hobby projects at once to keep your motivation up - but what if that keeps you from other wargaming motivation?

Vince Venturella and I made another game! Check out Deth Wizards at http://www.dethwizardsgame.com

I'm now a partner on Twitch! I paint minis every Friday morning and Monday night, and sometimes take paint breaks (play video games poorly). Follow me: http://www.twitch.tv/tabletopminions
