Nintendo's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a> won't be hit by the same component shortages that blighted the launch of other recent consoles and led to months of product scarcity and scalping. 
</p><p>
Speaking to investors this week, Nintendo <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/qa2406e.pdf">said</a> it had now "resolved" the issue which had seen it unable to manufacture enough Switch 1 hardware to meet demand in previous years. Both Sony, with PlayStation, and Microsoft, with Xbox, faced similar shortages for their own parts. 
</p><p>
"That situation has now been resolved," Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa said of Switch 1 stock. "As for the
successor to Nintendo Switch, at present we do not think shortages of components will significantly affect production."

Nintendo has responded to concern over the inappropriate use of its characters online and said it would take "appropriate action" against anything that would make some players "feel uncomfortable".
</p><p>
Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa was <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/qa2406e.pdf">recently</a> questioned by a shareholder who said they had "come across cases on social media where Nintendo IP and games are used inappropriately". This "inappropriate" use of Nintendo's characters "poses the risk of damaging" the company's brand, the question continued - so what was Nintendo planning to do about it?
</p><p>
In response, Furukawa said Nintendo's management policy was to "bring smiles through entertainment" (but presumably not the kind o

A developer who worked on Rockstar's scrapped GTA 5 single-player Trevor DLC has discussed the project's cancellation and expressed regret it never saw the light of day.
</p><p>
The existence of GTA 5 single-player DLC, in which fan-favourite character Trevor Philips would have taken a starring role, has been discussed previously, and fans have wondered for some time if they'd ever hear more on why it was never released - though the sheer magnitude of GTA Online's success always seemed the reason why Rockstar ultimately priotised its resources there. 
</p><p>
Now, speaking to YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uikfph7oQoE">SanInPlay</a>, former Rockstar senior camera artist and virtual cinematographer Joseph Rubino has discussed his work on the project - and why it was cancelled.

A little less than a year since its debut, seasonal content for Capcom's dino shooter Exoprimal has come to an end. Or, as our Tom just said, it looks like it failed to meteor expectations, and is now set for extinction.
</p><p>
"With the release of Title Update 4, all planned Exoprimal seasonal content is now complete," <a href="https://info.exoprimal.com/en/pages/important_240705_001/">Capcom</a> announced earlier today.
</p><p>
This now means at the end of season four on 11th July, season one will make a return.

Ubisoft's sparkling new version of the beloved Beyond Good &amp; Evil includes a touching tribute to Emil Morel, the veteran Ubisoft Montpellier developer who <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beyond-good-and-evil-2-creative-director-emile-morel-dies">sadly died last year aged just 40</a>. 
</p><p>
A bouquet of flowers can now be found lying on a bench in Hillys' centre, with an envelope marked simply by the letter 'E'. 
</p><p>
I've checked with Ubisoft to see if this addition is indeed a tribute to Morel from the game's development team, and been told yes.

A dataminer discovered the lines in the game's internal files when comparing English and Japanese dialogue and shared to reddit.

The lines themselves don't offer any groundbreaking insight, but it's certainly an interesting decision to cut the lines. <strong>Major spoilers for the final boss follow</strong>.

</p><p>One bright Thursday morning, I walked into class and asked my NYU graduate students what they'd thought of the movie I'd recently assigned, FW Murnau's classic 1920's German silent film Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror. Within nary a heartbeat, one of my gay students looked me straight in the eyes and declared, "Count Orlok is hot!"</p><p>This wasn't a wholly unexpected response. The queer attraction to monstrosity has long been a recurring topic of academic discourse. In 2021, in this very series of Pride-themed articles, Dr Lloyd (Meadhbh) Houston <
