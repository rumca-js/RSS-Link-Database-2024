Shadow of the Erdtree has introduced so many new weapons and spells to the player sandbox, but something they’ve also added are player transformation items. Some of these can be a bit silly, while others can define your whole build if you let it. The Dragon Cult Priestess excels at using Dragon Cult incantations, as her unique transformation item gives her a 20% damage bonus for said incantations. As such, we’ll be focussing on a high-faith build to complement the Faith requirements and scaling that these lightning spells demand.
