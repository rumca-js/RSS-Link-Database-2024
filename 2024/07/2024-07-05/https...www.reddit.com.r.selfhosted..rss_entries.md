Furthermore, we can really only support one &quot;group&quot; of visitors at a time due our bedroom layout. So, I had the idea to setup a quick scheduling app that we can pass out for visitors to &quot;schedule&quot; time and de-conflict trips.</p> <p>However, I am struggling to figure out what app would be good for this purpose. I run a Nextcloud instance internally and I am sure that there is some sort of Nextcloud workflow that would work, however Nextcloud tends to be a bit heavy and I don't know how I feel about opening it up (even for a bit) to the wide internet for my family to use.</p> <p>I do have a public facing web server isolated on my network with my own domains. It mostly runs a few Hugo websites, but I do have Docker behind an Apache proxy for a few services allowing me a numb

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey folks, new to the self hosting game, I set up an unraid server a few months ago, and it's been fairly reliable but I'm off site for extended periods of time and occasionally something will happen to the unraid server that results in me being locked out because it's hosting things like my RustDesk ID server.</p> <p>This is just a hobby project, not something I want to spend enterprise-level hardware cash on, nor is it absolutely critical to have 100% uptime. No one is going to die if my system goes down. But it is hosting things like home assistant, frigate, a blue iris VM, etc. So downtime isn't great, especially if I'm not around so I need to remotely power cycle the server with a Tasmota flashed smart plug which I really really don't like doing for the risk of data loss.</p> <p>So after all that my question is: Would putting some of my more critical services like RustDesk, DHCP/DNS server onto a Raspberry Pi be a good solution? I feel like its a

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I've learned how to dump MySQL and Postgres databases, but I'm unclear on how to (properly) back up services with SQLite databases. I do run a daily script in which I stop all Docker containers and back up the Docker volumes and bind mount locations. I'm trying to determine if I should be doing anything different or more.</p> <p>Some sources cite a command to dump the database, while others suggest copying the database file directly. I didn't have much success with either. I couldn't get the command to execute, I guess because the dump tool isn't installed inside the containers, and I can't always find a database file in the Docker volumes or bind mount locations in order to copy it.</p> <p>Thanks.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/makeshift_gray"> /u/makeshift_gray </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1dw1zav/backing_up_sqlite_databases/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Is there a selfhosted solution similar to Mailchimp, Constant Contact, etc? I already have self hosted email servers, just need something that can handle the contacts and mail templates for a few users. We have a few thousand contacts and just want to send out emails to announce new league seasons, cancelations, not going to bombard the customers with useless shit. Would be nice if it had opt in/out features. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/mikeee404"> /u/mikeee404 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1dvlwsl/alternative_to_mailchimp_constant_contact/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1dvlwsl/alternative_to_mailchimp_constant_contact/">[comments]</a></span>
