								<p>I&rsquo;m currently reading Quests from the Infinite Staircase, the next Dungeons and Dragons book to be released by Wizards of the Coast. And I know it&rsquo;s early days yet, but I think I&rsquo;ve found my perfect starter adventure for One DnD. When the new rulebooks drop, I&rsquo;ll take them for a test spin by running &hellip; <a href="https://www.wargamer.com/dnd/infinite-staircase-when-a-star-falls">Continued</a></p>

								<p>I&rsquo;m pretty happy about the upcoming November 2024 release, Magic: The Gathering Foundations. The idea of a back-to-basics set of simple but effective cards has a tidiness to it that appeals. It should be a great way for new players to learn the game, and I&rsquo;m rooting for its success. However, as an established player, &hellip; <a href="https://www.wargamer.com/magic-the-gathering/mtg-card-foundations-reset">Continued</a></p>

								<p><strong>MTG Cascade</strong> is a keyword that lets you cast an extra spell for free, but behind this simple concept, you’ll find surprising complexity. This guide breaks down and explains all the key <strong>Cascade Magic: The Gathering</strong> rules, including how to resolve multiple Cascades and what cards can and can’t be cast with the ability.</p>
<p>We’ll also cover the differences between Cascade and Discover, a keyword that’s cropped up in recent <a href="https://www.wargamer.com/magic-the-gathering/mtg-sets-in-order">MTG sets</a>. After that, we’ll look at the best Cascade cards for your Magic decks (or <a href="https://www.wargamer.com/magic-the-gathering-arena/mtg-arena-decks">MTG Arena decks</a>, if you prefer to play online).</p>

								<p>Few Warhammer 40,000 vehicles are as dopey as the Invader ATV, a Space Marines recon support vehicle with no ground clearance, no suspension, and a gunner positioned to deafen the driver. We asked Imperial Fists superfan Phalanx_Minis how he converted his squadron of Invaders to fix this most questionable of vehicles.

								<p>The One Ring has been a terror in the Modern format ever since it was printed. An incredible protection spell and source of card draw, it&rsquo;s only become a more vital MTG card as time goes by, getting gradually pricier and pricier, to the point where one copy now costs well over $100.

								<p>SOVL: Fantasy Warfare is a turn-based strategy game with a visual style ripped straight from the battle report section of White Dwarf magazine, circa the mid 1990s. In this fantasy wargame, troop formations are represented by simple rectangles, decorated with flag colors and iconography, just as they were in classic Warhammer battle reports that older &hellip; <a href="https://www.wargamer.com/sovl-fantasy-warfare/retro-warhammer-battle-report">Continued</a></p>

The Titan Evo Warhammer 40,000 Ultramarines Edition is rock solid, bright blue, and packed with high-tech features &ndash; the Primaris Space Marine of gaming chairs, if you will.
