<p>Epic says that Apple has once again rejected its submission for a third-party app store, <a href="https://x.com/epicnewsroom/status/1809179985682325649">according to a series of posts on X</a>. The company says that Apple rejected the latest submission over the design and position of the “install” button on the app store, claiming that it too closely resembles Apple's own “get” button. Apple also allegedly said that Epic’s “in-app purchases” label is too similar to its own label, used for the same reason.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The maker of <em>Fortnite</em> suggests that this is just another salvo in the long-running dispute between the two companies. Epic says that it’s using the same “install” and “in-app purchases” naming conventions found “across popular app stores on multiple platforms.” As for the design language, the company states that it's “following standard conventions for buttons in iOS apps” and that they’re “just trying to build a store that mobile users can easily understand.

<p><em>Don’t look down. Don’t look down. Don’t look down.</em></p>
<p>Waves the size of skyscrapers explode beneath me as I creep across a busted metal beam in the middle of the North Sea, suspended at the base of an oil rig that’s in the process of collapsing. I’m crawling swiftly but carefully, knees sliding on the wet metal and eyes locked on the platform in front of me. <em>Don’t look down.</em></p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>I look down. The cold sea is boiling just inches from my beam, white spray reaching up, threatening to pull me under miles of suffocating darkness and pressure. <em>Fuck.</em></p>

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-26-youtube-creators-address-copyright-claims.html">YouTube</a> is trying to make it easy for its creators to remove songs from their videos and resolve copyright claims. In a new Creator Insider video, the website has <a href="https://x.com/nealmohan/status/1808587459132825844">announced</a> that it has released an upgraded &quot;erase song&quot; tool that has the capability to remove music from video segments without deleting other audio, such as conversations, as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When creators get a copyright claim for music, YouTube gives them the option to trim out the affected segment or to replace the song with an approved one in its audio library. Creators can't monetize that particular video until they resolve the claim. The website has been testing its &quot;erase song&quot; tool for a while, but in the video, the company says it hasn't been as accurate as it would like. To solve that problem, it redesigned the tool so that it no

<p>Amazon changed the face of retail over the last 20 years but has failed miserably to make inroads in the luxury goods market. Now, it's trying something new. The online retailer has purchased a small stake in retailer Neiman Marcus and will reportedly provide data and logistics to Neiman and its new owner, Saks Fifth Avenue.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Saks Fifth Avenue and parent HBC announced the $2.65 billion acquisition of Neiman Marcus (which also owns Bergdorf Goodman), putting the largest US luxury retailers under the same roof, <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=2f007401-3eaa-4237-b69b-54ccbe125502&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+Wall+Street+Journal&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy53c2ouY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2RlYWxzL3Nha3Mtb3duZXItdG8tYnV5LW5laW1hbi1tYXJjdXN3aXRoLWhlbHAtZnJvbS1hbWF6b24tZjcxYTBmZGEiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImE1Y2Zj

<p>Nike is discontinuing its self-lacing Adapt BB sneakers and providing a case in point of what can happen to tech that relies on apps. First <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-01-15-nike-adapt-bb-self-lacing-basketball-shoes.html">announced in 2019</a>, the sneakers used a <em>Back to the Future II</em>  style power-lacing system called FitAdapt that was adjustable either manually or with an app. Now, the company will no longer make new Adapt shoes and is retiring the Nike Adapt App, it announced in a <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=53c40753-9e7a-4c64-919c-e9c2a4c225b3&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Nike&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5uaWtlLmNvbS9oZWxwL2EvYWRhcHQtYXBwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI2OWI1MDVhNC1mZWU4LTQ5NzItYjkwMy0wMjUwZmE4NTlkMTkifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAc4u32ubF78W4jfqkk_a4zd0h2G-MbderxITqbOeJEur&amp;gcRefer

<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, July 4th was a quiet day for news, but we’ve still got editorials on e-ink writing, the most-delayed video game ever and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/openai-hit-by-two-big-security-issues-this-week-214316082.html">more bad news</a> from the makers of ChatGPT.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Earlier this week, engineer and Swift developer Pedro José Pereira Vieito dug into OpenAI's Mac ChatGPT app and found that it was storing user conversations locally in plain text, rather than encrypting them. Because that app is only available from OpenAI's website, and since it's not available on the App Store, it doesn't have to follow Apple's sandboxing requirements. OpenAI released an update that added encryption to locally stored chats.</p>
<p>Then, more bad news stemmed from issues in 2023. Last spring, a hacker obtained information about OpenAI after illicitly accessing the company's internal messaging systems. <em>The New York Times </em>reported that OpenAI technical program m
