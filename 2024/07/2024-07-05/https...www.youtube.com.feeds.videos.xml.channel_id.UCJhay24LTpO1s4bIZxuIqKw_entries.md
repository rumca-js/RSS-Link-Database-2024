Future of Software Programming with AI Bots at Hand - Amir Kirsh - ACCU 2024
---

Most developers would agree by now that AI and Large Language Models are a game changer for programming.
In this talk we will try to discuss the immediate and future implications on software development.
Would our work process be affected? How?
What can we learn from current ChatGPT coding mistakes on the challenges ahead?
How can we be better prepared for a new era coming ahead?

The talk would be driven based on actual code examples, extrapolating to future development of artificial intelligent tools and their implications.
The audience would be encouraged to be active in the discussion, sharing thoughts and comments.
