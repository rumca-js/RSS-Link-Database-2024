Humbird — the musical project fronted by singer-songwriter Siri Undlin — are off to their next chapter with the release of Right On. Not only have they been signed to a major label, Vancouver-based Nettwerk Music Group, but the latest album, Right On, has a grittier, more electric feel than previous releases. It’s all part of the band’s evolution. “I feel like we're in our teenage years now,” Undlin says.

Just about to embark on tour in support of the record, Humbird — Undlin along with drummer Nathaniel LeBrun and bassist Pat Kuehn — visited The Current studio for a session hosted by Radio Heartland’s Mike Pengra. Watch and listen to "Cornfields" above.
