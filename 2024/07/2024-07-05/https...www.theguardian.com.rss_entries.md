## Théo Hernandez hits the spot as France beat Portugal in shootout to progress

<p>Two teams that simply could not score all night finally found their range in the shootout and, in the end, it was France who held their nerve. They had Théo Hernandez to thank for sending them through after João Félix, the only player to falter, struck a post with his penalty. In a strange affair of shots, chances but no finishing touch, Cristiano Ronaldo was left to regret squandering a glorious opening while Kylian Mbappé may wait anxiously on any consequences from what appeared a painful blow to his broken nose.</p><p>The question before kick-off had been whether these sides, both yet to flow freely despite their attacking riches, would elect to turn on the taps. Portugal had drawn blanks ever since brushing Turkey aside while France, two own goals and a penalty to their name, had eased this far without offering much of note at all.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jul/05/portugal-france-euro-2024-quarter-final-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Germany’s second summer fairy tale is over but Spain’s goes on, Stuttgart stunned at the last. With 65 seconds of extra time remaining, with penalties inevitable and players pulling up all over the pitch, barely able to walk, Dani Olmo clipped in a glorious ball and there, deep in the penalty area, was Mikel Merino. A turn of the head, a twist of the neck and Spain were on their way.</p><p>Still they had to survive a scare – how could it be otherwise? – when Niclas Füllkrug headed past the post a minute into added time at the end of it. And then, four minutes beyond the 120, with the very last kick of the game, the very last kick of Toni Kroos’s entire career in fact, they had to face one last ball into their box. Manuel Neuer was up for that. So though was Unai Simón, clutching firm to the ball and to Spain’s place in the semi-final of Euro 2024.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jul/05/spain-germany-euro-2024-quarter-final-match-report">Continue readi

<p>Gareth Southgate’s side found success going wide against Slovakia. It can be a blueprint in their hunt for a semi-final berth</p><p>There are three simple ways of playing football: through, over and around. When one of those approaches is not working, it is upon a team to try one of the other two. Doing the same thing again and again in those circumstances is not advantageous because it becomes increasingly easy to defend against. England have found this out and it now looks as if they are going to change.</p><p>It has been clear throughout the European Championship that England have had issues with balance. The combination of Kieran Trippier and Phil Foden has not produced what Gareth Southgate might have hoped from an attacking perspective and a change of formation appears to be afoot. It looks likely Southgate will switch to a back three for the ­quarter-final against Switzerland on Saturday.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jul/05/width-key-england

<p>Labour will rue the seats lost to independents and Greens, and the failure to respond to anger over its stance on Gaza</p><p>If the Starmer project has a guiding philosophy, it goes like this: Labour must define itself against the left. If a speech or policy offends the left, then good. If a candidate on the party’s left makes it through, they should be marginalised or purged. Within the electorate, leftwing voters are seen as irrelevant, because they’ll vote Labour no matter what to keep the Tories out, with those votes stacking up in safe urban seats.</p><p>Starmer’s cheerleaders may well conclude that this strategy still holds. After all, Labour has secured a landslide victory, and the Tories have suffered their most shattering defeat since they were founded in their modern form 190 years ago. Indeed, in our democratic history, no electoral rout has been more deserved. The evidence was everywhere, from an unparalleled squeeze in living standards to Liz Truss’s deranged attempt t

These days we can only be relied on to be either indecisive or disloyal. Sometimes we are both.

<p>Wine choices are often as much a question of mood as food  </p><p>Although I’m writing this before knowing the outcome of the election, it’s hard to imagine that my mood this weekend will be anything but buoyant. In the days when I was actively involved in politics, I thought of nothing else during a campaign, but, for most people, it’s not quite as visceral – for many, in fact, this might be just a perfectly normal weekend.</p><p>That said, wine choices are often as much a question of mood as food. Alcohol should, of course, never be seen as a panacea for feeling low, but there are some wines that are especially celebratory, champagne being the most obvious example – there’s nothing quite like the popping of a cork to make all seem well with the world (screw caps are practical, but they don’t make you feel special).</p><p>For more by Fiona Beckett, go to <a href="https://fionabeckett.substack.com/">fionabeckett.substack.com</a></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/article

Plus: more Abbott Elementary</p><p>Rashida Jones stars in this series (adapted from Colin O’Sullivan’s novel) about an American woman living in Japan whose husband and son disappear in a plane crash. In a daze of grief, Suzie (Jones) reluctantly takes delivery of Sunny, an infuriatingly cheerful – and worryingly perceptive – domestic robot made by her husband’s electronics company and programmed to respond to her unique sensibilities. But there’s a mystery: Suzie soon becomes uncomfortably aware that robots like Sunny might not be as safe as they seem. It’s a gripping mixture of pitch-black comedy and cleverly realised future shock, with an excellent performance from Jones. <em><br />
