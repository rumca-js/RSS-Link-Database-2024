		Dozens of airports across Europe are unprepared for the European Union’s upcoming biometric travel registration scheme, the Entry-Exit System (EES), according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA).

According to the airline industry trade body, smaller airports across Europe are still lagging in installing the fingerprint technology required by the EES. Starting this fall, non-EU nationals must submit biometric data upon crossing the border for the first time.

“Urgent and coordinated action” is needed if terminals are to be ready before the October 6th deadline, IATA says. Rafael Schvartzman, the organization’s regional head for Europe, called for a transition period to alleviate the long queues<a href="https://www.biometricupd

		More airports across the world are going biometric, implementing contactless border crossings and new digital services.

Caribbean tourist destination Curaçao claims that it has introduced the world’s first fully operational biometric border crossing program called Curaçao Express Pass and it's hoping to reduce traveler processing times by more than 50 percent.

The Curaçao International Airport will allow travelers to share their passport data with border authorities before their trip through the <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/airside-mobile">Airside</a> Digital Identity App from Entrust.

		Australia is making progress in bringing together the country’s digital identity schemes and making them interoperable, including the federal myGov platform and the Service NSW app, created by the New South Wales government.

The government has made several small announcements that prove its commitment to this direction,<a href="https://www.themandarin.com.au/249610-small-steps-see-decent-progress-on-australias-digital-id-journey/"> according</a> to an opinion piece published by The Mandarin.

Signs that point to this direction are the latest Data and Digital Ministers’ Meeting (DDMM) communique which mentioned a “framework for all governments.” Australian Minister for Government Services Bill Shorten also revealed that credentials such as New South Wales licenses will be admi

		One solution that could help ameliorate long queues at airports is the Digital Travel Credential (DTC), the digital equivalent of a passport issued by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). But not all DTCs are made the same, says <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/sita">SITA</a>.

The air transport industry IT software provider has published a checklist for a true “gold standard” DTC. One of the requirements of a real DTC is that it is a government-grade digital identity, which assures governments they are made from authentic passports and allows automated border entry using biometrics. DTCs are also supposed to allow pre-clearance for passengers long before they board flights, shortening wait times at airports.

Finally, DTC, c

		A recent <a href="https://www.esentire.com/blog/securing-passkeys-thwarting-authentication-method-redaction-attacks" rel="noopener" target="_blank">blog post from eSentire</a> discussed new strategies to secure passkeys and prevent authentication method redaction attacks, a technique used by cybercriminals to bypass security measures. These attacks involve manipulating the authentication process.

Authentication method redaction attacks involve bypassing primary authentication methods in favor of less-secure backup methods, which in turn enables Adversary-in-the-Middle (AitM) phishing attacks. eSentire demonstrates such an attack against Github, but says that numerous passkey implementations are similarly flawed.

		The Age Verification Provider’s Association (<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/the-age-verification-providers-association">AVPA</a>) has withdrawn its support for California’s online age verification bill in response to amendments that remove the requirement for pornography websites to check the age of their users.

		Influential studies from 2018 and 2019 still hold a prominent place in many reports on demographic differentials or bias in face biometrics applications, despite their greatly diminished relevance and some obviously better sources of current information.

A report from Just Futures Law and Mijente alleges that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and its agencies are utilizing artificial intelligence for a wide variety of immigration system applications that have tremendous impact on vulnerable people. They are doing so with little oversight, and in some cases in ways that do not comply with federal policies, including DHS’ own rules.

The system will leverage decentralized computing and digital identity to provide access to secure domestic financing and international trade financing. The partnership focuses on the development and testing of a prototype for a data infrastructure under the UTC pilot initiative in Cambodia.

“The partnership with the Dfinity Foundation marks a pivotal moment in our efforts to advance digital inclusion and economic empowerment for MSMEs in Cambodia,” says Marcos Neto, UN assistant secretary general and director of UNDP’s Bureau for Po

		After Microsoft revealed that it could not guarantee the sovereignty of UK policing data hosted on its cloud servers, the Scottish biometrics watchdog has called on a formal investigation into Scotland's police use of the U.S. company's cloud services.

Police in Scotland have been using the cloud for its Digital Evidence Sharing Capability (DESC), a £33 ­million (US$42 million) evidence-sharing IT system designed to provide easier access to CCTV footage, photographs and other data – including biometrics.

Microsoft, however, admitted last month that it could not guarantee policing data uploaded into DESC would remain in the UK. U.S. Companies must abide by the U.S. Cloud Act, which allows federal law enforcement ag

		The landscape of digital identity verification is undergoing a significant transformation in an era dominated by concerns over data privacy and security. Traditional methods often involve sharing sensitive personal information with third-party entities, raising risks of data breaches and identity theft. However, new technologies are emerging to address these challenges, offering users greater control over their personal data while ensuring compliance with regulatory standards.

In on the action is Privado ID, a spinout of Polygon, focused on pioneering technology that upholds user privacy through identity verification methods, Chief Product Officer Sebastian Rodriguez tells <em>Biometric Update</em> in an interview.

Strict age verification measures are crucial in sectors such as tobacco retail, casino establishments, and motorway service stations featuring gaming facilities. These measures prevent underage individuals from gaining access to restricted areas or using gaming machines.

“With ongoing government regulations regarding the tightening of age verification in the gambling sector, the need and uptake of automated age check technology will undoubtedly increase,” says Dr. Andrew O’Brien, product manager at I
