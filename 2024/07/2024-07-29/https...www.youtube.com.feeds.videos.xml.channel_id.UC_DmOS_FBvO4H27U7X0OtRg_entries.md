After a wild trip on Ayahuasca, I felt like I was still high months later. I felt brain fog. I felt my life was a movie, like it wasn't real. I made this video to hopefully help anyone who is currently stuck in the same spot. If you're are, you're totally fine, your brain isn't broken. The solution is simple.
Anxiety feeds off fear. The more you fear that something is wrong, the worse it gets. The solution is simply replacing the thoughts of fear in your head with ones of love like "I love this feeling, it's just my body trying to help". 
Hope this sets some scared peo
