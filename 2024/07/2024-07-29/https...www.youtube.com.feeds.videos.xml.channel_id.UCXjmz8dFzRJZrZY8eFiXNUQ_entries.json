Little did his audience know, he was also a talented actor.   From being discovered by Jimmy Iovine and Dr. Dre, to multiple platinum selling records, to an eventual Oscar win, Eminem was on top of the world.   And after 8 Mile was released, audiences were excited to see the rap star in many more Hollywood features.  But since his turn as Jimmy B-Rabbit Smith Jr., Eminem has only graced the silver screen a couple times, with no real ambition to go back.  With the release of his new album The Death of Slim Shady (Coup de Gr\u00e2ce), it seems Em isn't gonna be slowing down anytime soon. \n\n#eminem #8mile #slimshady #marshallmathers #nerdstalgic \n\nSOURCES\nhttps://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/eminem-the-rolling-stone-interview-55203/\nhttps://www.vulture.com/article/oral-history-casting-mad-max-fury-road-tom-hardy-charlize-theron.html?utm_medium=s1&amp;utm_campaign=vulture&amp;utm_source=tw\nhttps://www.looper.com/190936/actors-", "id": 950203, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-95dWiPAcFs", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXjmz8dFzRJZrZY8eFiXNUQ", "source_obj__id": 236, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/-95dWiPAcFs/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Why Eminem Will Never Star In A Movie Again", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
