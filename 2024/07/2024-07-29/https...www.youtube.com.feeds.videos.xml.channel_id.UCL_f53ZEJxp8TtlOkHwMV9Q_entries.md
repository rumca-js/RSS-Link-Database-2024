Dr. Jordan Peterson sits down with political scientist and author Dr. Carol Swain. They discuss her rise in academia, her early disillusionment with DEI and the liberal agenda on campuses, her journey to faith, her choice to stand against the popular narrative, the gross plagiarism conducted by Harvardâ€™s president, and the continuing fight to reclaim our institutions.

Dr. Carol Swain is a political scientist, author of 12 books, and currently embroiled in a lawsuit with Harvard over their former President, Claudine Gay, who Swain alleges plagiarized her work. Academia is siding with Gay and in the process has redefined plagiarism.
