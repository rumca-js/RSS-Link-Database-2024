<p>The president’s speech leaves a legacy for his successors, but feels like a delayed acknowledgment of what’s long been clear to many</p><p>Joe Biden marked the start of his lame-duck presidency with a significant speech outlining three reforms for the US supreme court – an important speech from a man who has spent decades as a staunch defender of institutions.</p><p>Biden’s remarks on Monday were laden with symbolism. He took the stage at an event commemorating the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Civil Rights Act, taking the stage in an auditorium at the Lyndon B Johnson Presidential Library and Museum, where Johnson gave his final public remarks. It was an effort to link his legacy to Johnson, another president who served as a master of the Senate, vice-president, and president before <a href="https://www.history.com/news/lbj-exit-1968-presidential-race">choosing not to seek re-election</a>.

When you go to the polls in this country as a parent, you should have more power – you should have more of an ability to speak your voice in our democratic republic – than people who don’t have kids. Let’s face the consequences and the reality: If you don’t have as much of an investment in the future of this country, maybe you shouldn’t get nearly the same voice.”</p><p>This position now represents large swaths of the Republican party, which has tak

<p>Inspired by an unidentified boy found dead in the Thames, the first – and only – collection by the late poet is an imaginative meditation on death and those who disappear</p><p>This collection is a debut – it is also an ending. The poet Gboyega Odubanjo <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/aug/31/police-find-body-in-search-for-missing-poet-gboyega-odubanjo">died tragically</a> almost a year ago and the final edit of this extraordinary and arresting book has been overseen by friends, family and his publishers. It is, in one sense, a found poem – or series of poems – about something not a soul would ever wish to find. On 21 September 2001 – anyone alive at that time will remember it – the headless torso of a boy was discovered in the Thames, in the stretch near the Globe theatre, dressed in a pair of orange girls’ shorts. It was police officers who gave him the name of Adam. And although detectives went on to discover that he had been brutally dismembered in a ritual sac

<p>Jarring and heartbreaking documentary excavates the film-maker’s past while illuminating an abuser’s place in the cycle of violence</p><p>Enveloped in a sonic cocoon of gentle ocean waves and rustling wind, the sensorial opening of Efthymia Zymvragaki’s feature-length debut could be mistaken for the start of a picturesque nature documentary. Zymvragaki’s film, however, excavates the pain buried beneath such scenic beauty: after escaping her abusive childhood home in Crete, Zymvragaki – now living in Spain – is transported back to her past by an unusual proposal. She receives a confessional memoir from Ernesto, a Tenerife resident with a troubled history of abuse against women.</p><p>As Zymvragaki and Ernesto work together to bring his life to the screen, their stories collide in startling, heartbreaking ways. Both grew up under a domineering father who exercised a tyrannical control over his family. The coercive patterns were terrifyingly similar, alternating between periods of col

<p>Got a beauty dilemma? Our expert is here to offer advice. This week a reader has lost her confidence following major surgery</p><p>My first tip is to fill your time with self-care, rest and joy to feel yourself again after such a huge surgery. That could include anything from joining a mindfulness group, seeing friends more often and booking massages – whatever makes you feel good.</p><p>My second tip would be to give yourself some grace; changes to our physicality can be hard to cope with on a personal and societal level. It doesn’t help that society’s beauty standards dictate that women should be as near to perfection as possible, but we can keep all of that at arm’s length. One of the best things about social media is that all forms of beauty are celebrated, so use it to find people who have been through what you have and explore how they’re dealing with it.

<p>Ted Fendt’s portrait of three young women at creative crossroads follows their listless strolls and awkward gatherings with warm vitality</p><p>The lethargy of summer hangs pleasantly over Ted Fendt’s ruminative snapshot of quarter-life aimlessness. With a brief beginning in New York, the film drifts between the streets of Berlin and Vienna as it follows a trio of twentysomething women caught at the crossroads of intellectual and creative pursuits. Mia (Mia Sellman), Daniela (Daniela Zahlner), and Natascha (Natascha Manthe) amble their way through sleepless nights, listless strolls and awkward gatherings, and the film refreshingly posits their unmoored state not as a source of narrative tension, but a natural way of being.</p><p>The milieu of Outside Noise is specific; here is a world where everyone seems to be a writer, an artist or a graduate student with an existential crisis. Their central dilemma is echoed in the subject of Mia’s postgraduate thesis, which is concerned with th
