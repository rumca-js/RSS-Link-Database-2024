<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I'm close to putting in an order for a Dresden table. I've read as many comments about the table as I can find, and watched the few reviews on YouTube. Based on the reviews, I don't have any doubts about the quality, but I still have a few questions.</p> <ol> <li><p>What size did you get and do you have any regrets? (Our group usually has 4-5 players. We play a variety of euro style games from small to large.)</p></li> <li><p>Do you usually keep the inset at the lower level or use the pegs and put it at the higher level? If I bought a neoprene mat to put on the vault floor, would there be enough clearance to setup a game underneath the insert when it is on the pegs?</p></li> <li><p>I have a dedicated game space, and I don't see too much need for the dining top (especially at $2,500). Those of you that don't use it as a dining table, did you get the dining top? If so, do you ever use it? (I'm still considering it in the event we ever downsize our home,

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>For myself, if I know a question is answered in the rulebook, I'd rather stop the game to find the answer, no matter how small a point it is. However, if the rulebook is inconclusive, I'd rather make a quick-and-easy consensus ruling instead of searching online for more clarification, since that can open a whole can of worms. I want things to be done according to the rules even for actions that don't directly involve my pieces. It sometimes feels rude to interrupt someone's turn to correct them on something or say &quot;I'm not sure that's correct, can we check the rules?&quot;, but in my head, playing according to the game's rules is the reason to play the game, and playing correctly is the best way to learn the rules. I'm probably on the more rules-adherent side of things (I promise I'm fun too!), so I wonder what other people's feelings on the matter are, and how they justify those feelings. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a hre

## Books and movies don't have to be fun to watch to be great, what would a great game that wasn't fun be like?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Many years ago, Brenda Romero gave a talk where she remarked that of all creative arts, only games are required to be fun to be good. She challenged that idea and suggested that games could be great even if they weren't fun to play.</p> <p>Since then, I periodically return to this idea and try and imagine what that even means. I have fun when my choices are meaningful and challenging and I can interact with the game and the other players. Novel mechanics or uses of familiar mechanics and unusual or thought provoking themes are also fun for me. But I feel like that's all also what makes a game good.</p> <p>I've heard a lot about Romero's game <em>Train</em>, there's been scads of think pieces about it, but almost nothing about the actual gameplay. Maybe it's an example of a great game that isn't fun because it lacks most of what I mentioned? But I'm not sure because I know so little about the game itself.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#3

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I just finished my second game of King's Dilemma. The top 2 scoring players in both games passed on just about every vote. I also felt like the best play for me was usually to pass as most votes were mostly neutral to me (both good or both bad options). I mainly voted to get stickers or just for fun. My partner also said votes rarely mattered for her, and she just voted a lot for the story/to make the game fun. Only 1 player is maybe voting frequently for strategy, and he's not doing the best.</p> <p>Is it supposed to be mainly just a story game and not a competitive strategy game? Are we somehow playing wrong? Did we just get really unlucky with our events? My partner and I are getting kind of frustrated with the game. What are we missing? Are there popular house rules that will make the game more fun?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Tommyblockhead20"> /u/Tommyblockhead20 </a> <br /> <span><a hre

Would this person have a Disney+ subscription? Is this person a millionaire?&quot;</p> <p>You do frequently end up flipping the target person down but it made it so much fun. Also a great way to engage the kids and seeing what crazy questions they can come up with. Also great insight into what biases they have - we found big inter-generational gaps.
