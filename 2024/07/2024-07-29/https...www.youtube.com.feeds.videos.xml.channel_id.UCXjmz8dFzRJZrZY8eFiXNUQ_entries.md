Before 8 Mile, Eminem was already a global superstar.  Little did his audience know, he was also a talented actor.   From being discovered by Jimmy Iovine and Dr. Dre, to multiple platinum selling records, to an eventual Oscar win, Eminem was on top of the world.   And after 8 Mile was released, audiences were excited to see the rap star in many more Hollywood features.  But since his turn as Jimmy B-Rabbit Smith Jr., Eminem has only graced the silver screen a couple times, with no real ambition to go back.  With the release of his new album The Death of Slim Shady (Coup de Gr√¢ce), it seems Em isn't gonna be slowing down anytime soon.
