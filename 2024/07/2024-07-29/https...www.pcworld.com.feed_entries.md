<p>It hasn’t been a good year for Google. Last week, there was a glitch in Google Chrome that caused over 15 million passwords to simply disappear, forcing the global tech company to publicly apologize.</p>



<p>Due to a bug in Chrome’s password manager feature, users were unable to use saved passwords between July 24 and 25, nor was it possible to save new passwords.</p>



<p>Google issued an apology for the error and stated that the problem was isolated to the M127 version of the Chrome browser on Windows. This means that a quarter of all Chrome users were affected by the problem, around 15 million of whom actively use the password manager.</p>

<p>When the issue first arose, Google offered a temporary solution that required users to enter an additional

<p>The Nintendo Switch OLED is on sale right now with limited stock, so you’ll need to jump on this rare discount quick if you want to make out like a bandit and score big.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-OLED-Model-Mario-Red/dp/B09NCMZNJK" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch OLED is down to $325 on Amazon right now</a>, which is notable because the Switch OLED is rarely on sale. That makes this deal for $25 off a great opportunity to add this to your cart.</p>



<p>This isn’t just your regular Switch OLED model, either—it’s the Mario Red edition, which is rather gorgeous, if I do say so myself. It’s a limited edition design that will make you stand out among your group, as both the Joy-Cons and the docking station are an iconic red.</p>



<p>Since this is the OLED version, the screen is a bit larger and delivers

<p>Frame generation—previously a dirty word among gaming graphics enthusiasts—has blossomed into a serious card-selling feature. And while Nvidia’s DLSS (and related tech) is currently at the top of the heap, AMD isn’t letting them sit there uncontested.</p>



<p>A new technical preview of the Adrenalin driver package includes the first release of Fluid Motion Frames 2.</p>



<p>If frame generation is the buzzword in graphics, then AI is the buzzword everywhere else—and AMD claims that Fluid Motion Frames 2 includes “AI-optimized enhancements” for improved smoothness and latency.</p>



<p>If you want custom-fit improvements, you can also dig into the settings to more completely tweak the results.</p>

<p>AI has quickly become one of the most important areas of software today, with various tools now available to help when writing, creating artwork, researching subjects, or even improving the quality of existing images.

<p>Pairing AirPods or AirPods Pro with a PC may not be as dead simple as with an iOS device, but it’s only a tiny bit harder. You just connect the earbuds via Bluetooth—a straightforward, fast process in both Windows 10 and Windows 11 (though <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/815705/bluetooth-giving-you-the-blues-in-windows-11-heres-how-to-connect-to-devices-faster.html">Windows 11 added steps to connect Bluetooth devices</a>). Just follow our steps below and you’ll be off and running.</p>



<p>Do note, however, that as an Apple product, AirPods and AirPod Pros lose some functionality in Windows. They work well for <em>listening</em> to audio, but fall quite short of microphone quality you’d get on iOS or macOS, and simply having the microphone active can affect audio quality as well. So while Apple’s earbuds can handle Zoom calls in a pinch, we’d steer clea
