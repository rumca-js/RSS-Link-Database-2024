  <p id="1cSzGr">A federal judge in New York ruled that Customs and Border Protection (CBP) can’t search travelers’ phones without a warrant. The ruling theoretically applies to land borders, seaports, and airports — but in practice, it only applies to New York’s Eastern District. </p>
<p id="ysCwmE">That’s not nothing, though, since the district includes John F. Kennedy Airport in Queens, the sixth-busiest airport in the country. Nationwide, CBP has conducted <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/cbp-enforcement-statistics">more than 230,000 searches</a> of electronic devices between the 2018 and 2023 fiscal year

But Dinosaur Polo Club, the indie studio behind the minimalist strategy games <em>Mini Metro</em> and <em>Mini Motorways</em>, has revealed a recently canceled project in a refreshing bout of transparency.</p>
<p id="DwBoxa">The game was codenamed <em>Magic School</em>, and it was an attempt for the studio to branch out from the clean, streamlined experiences it has become known for. The problem? As the concept grew in scope, it became clear to the studio that a much bigger team would be needed, which led them to abandon

  <p id="lGL1DY">When Simone Biles saluted the judges and stepped onto the mat to vault at the Sportpaleis in Antwerp, Belgium, it seemed like every camera in the packed arena was trained on her. People in the audience pulled their smartphones to record. The photographers zoomed in from their media perches. One TV camera tracked her run on a high-speed dolly, all the way down the runway, as she hurdled into a roundoff onto the springboard. The spider cam, swinging above, caught the upward trajectory of her body as she turned towards the table and blocked up and off, twisting one and a half times before landing on the blue mat and raising her arms above her head. The apex of human athleticism and kinesthetic beauty had been captured.</p>
