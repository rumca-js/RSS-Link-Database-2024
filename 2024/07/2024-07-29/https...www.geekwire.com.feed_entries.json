GeekWire spotted a SEC filing last week that revealed new funding for MarkOS. The company&#8217;s CEO, Marius Ciocirlan, confirmed the new investment. Ciocirlan was previously managing director at Techstars Seattle before the startup accelerator shut down earlier this year. His co-founders at MarkOS are David Dawson, co-founder of recycling startup Ridwell, and Wesley Yun, former head of design at Asana.
