Fourth is always difficult’</li></ul><p>As the final rotation of the gymnastics men’s team final began, the Chinese team seemed almost certain to ­finish Monday as Olympic gold medallists. After dominating the qualifying on Saturday, they had established a commanding three-point lead over Japan with three routines to go. Both teams closed out the competition on the horizontal bar, where China had outscored Japan. With plenty of room for error, all they had to do was remain relatively solid to secure their win.</p><p>However, when attempting to execute some of the most difficult gymnastics skills in the world under suffocating pressure, things can quickly fall apart. What followed was a meltdown of the ages. First Xiao Ruoteng, the Chinese veteran, landed his dismount to his knees, stumbling forward before regaining his balance.

The rule that any carer earning over £151 a week must forfeit the entirety of the allowance enabling them to care for a family member who is sick or disabled (and has been formally assessed as needing care) needs to be altered.

<p>Normally you’d bake or deep-fry parmigiana di zucchini, but here’s a novel way to make it in a frying pan</p><p><strong><br /></strong>I first ate this dish, cooked in this way, on a campsite in Puglia. The cook was the Scottish husband of a Sicilian surgeon, while the frying pan, having lost its plastic handle on a previous holiday, was moved on and off the small Primus stove with surgical forceps. Necessity drove the cooking and the <em>parmigiana di zucchine </em>was made in one pan over a low flame.</p><p>As with aubergine parmigiana, a common way to prepare courgette for parmigiana di zucchine is to dredge the courgette slices in flour, then to deep-fry them. Alternatively, brush the slices with oil and griddle or bake. Wonderful ways both, but neither ideal for camping. Some recipes suggest raw courgette as a solution, but the problem with that is that, regardless of how thinly it is cut, the courgette always remains slightly raw and green tasting. The answer to all the above

<p>The Australian comic started standup at 17, but a fear of ‘schlepping around’ for 60 years led him to retire. Now, eight years later, he has rediscovered his mojo – and is back with a set musing on his recent autism diagnosis</p><p>Until a short London run&nbsp;earlier this month, Josh&nbsp;Thomas had never performed in the UK. “I&nbsp;don’t think anyone thought I’d sell any tickets,” he says. “I didn’t think I would, either. The only metric I have to know how famous I am in different countries is my Grindr.” Wherever Thomas logs in from, he can assess his local popularity from the proportion of users who recognise him. “And in the UK, those numbers are low, which is <em>not</em> a good sign.”</p><p>The 37-year-old Aussie comic’s anxieties were misplaced. We are meeting mid-morning at the Underbelly Boulevard, a new 200-capacity venue in the heart of Soho, central London.

<p>Samuel Beckett’s groundbreaking play is back again, this time starring Ben Whishaw and Lucian Msamati. Its tragicomic take on existence may match our cultural moment</p><p>Godot keeps on coming. A play that on its London debut in 1955 was greeted with bafflement and derision (“another of those plays that tries to lift superficiality to significance through obscurity,” wrote Milton Shulman in the Evening Standard) is now big box office. The latest iteration of Samuel Beckett’s groundbreaker comes in September when Lucian Msamati and Ben Whishaw appear in James Macdonald’s production at that temple of luxurious elegance, the Theatre Royal Haymarket. So what has changed in close on 70 years to make Beckett’s play popular?</p><p>The short answer would be that both the theatre and the culture at large are very different now from what they were in 1955. One thing Beckett taught us was that plays need neither spacious plots, sumptuous sets nor multiple characters to hold our attention: as
