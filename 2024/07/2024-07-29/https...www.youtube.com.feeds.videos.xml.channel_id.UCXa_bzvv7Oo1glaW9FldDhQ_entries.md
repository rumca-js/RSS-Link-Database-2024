A little over a decade on from its launch, High Moon Studios' Deadpool isn’t exactly a game that gets brought up all that often, and looking at its review scores would suggest that it isn’t exactly worthy of being remembered either. 

But though it’s not one of the greatest games you’re ever going to play by any stretch of the imagination, it is a surprisingly solid game with more than its fair share of strengths, especially for fans of the property. Though admittedly weighed down by issues of its own, the 2013 Deadpool game also boasted incredible writing and humour, while also being a fairly fun (if straightforward) hack and slash action game. Here, we talk about all of that and more.

Khaos Reigns in Mortal Kombat 1 as a new threat emerges for Liu Kang and the Forces of Light to tackle. As the first story DLC for the 2023 fighter, there are new playable characters, including series favorites like Cyrax, Sektor, and Noob Saibot. More importantly, there are teases of a brand new interdimensional war.

Looking beyond the trailer and Havik being the main villain, there may be more going on than meets the eye. The Kamidogu, last seen in Mortal Kombat X, could play a central role. Onaga, the Dragon King, could see a fitful resurrection. 

There are several possible plot points, even if the end is hard to predict. Join us as we theorize what could happen in Mortal Kombat 1: Khaos Reigns before it launches on September 24th.

There’s no rule that any new game that is coming out has to do something entirely new that no game has ever done before, but at times, it’s hard not to notice when a game is doing particularly little of that, especially when it’s a sizeable release coming from a major developer. 

Massive Entertainment’s Star Wars Outlaws is a game that has drawn some criticism in that department of late, with some criticizing its gameplay reveals for looking like they have lifted elements from countless similar games too liberally, in departments ranging from stealth to combat and more. But how much of an issue is that really? Here, we are going to discuss all of that and more.
