They discuss her rise in academia, her early disillusionment with DEI and the liberal agenda on campuses, her journey to faith, her choice to stand against the popular narrative, the gross plagiarism conducted by Harvard\u2019s president, and the continuing fight to reclaim our institutions.\n\nDr. Carol Swain is a political scientist, author of 12 books, and currently embroiled in a lawsuit with Harvard over their former President, Claudine Gay, who Swain alleges plagiarized her work. Academia is siding with Gay and in the process has redefined plagiarism.\n\nThis episode was recorded on July 5th, 2024\n\nDr. Peterson's extensive catalog is available now on DailyWire+: https://bit.ly/3KrWbS8\n\nALL LINKS: https://linktr.ee/drjordanbpeterson\n\n\n- Sponsors -\n\nHallow: Get 3 months free at https://hallow.com/Jordan \n\nBirch Gold: Text \"JORDAN\" to 989898 for your no-cost, no-obligation, FREE information kit.\n\n\n- Links -\n\n", "id": 951704, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFmE2fEO1pM", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q", "source_obj__id": 167, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/UFmE2fEO1pM/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Plagiarized by Harvard's President | Dr. Carol Swain | EP 467", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-07-29T19:00:00+00:00", "description": "", "id": 951014, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oA7GiZI3aU", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 26, "page_rating_contents": 82, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q", "source_obj__id": 167, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/0oA7GiZI3aU/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "She Doesn't Deserve Her Title", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-07-29T16:00:44+00:00", "description": "", "id": 950639, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNvzUiASZqI", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 26, "page_rating_contents": 82, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q", "source_obj__id": 167, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/oNvzUiASZqI/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Can the Education System Be Fixed?", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
