<div class="field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden"><div class="field__items"><div class="field__item even"><p><span>The proposed UN Cybercrime Convention is an extensive surveillance pact that imposes intrusive domestic surveillance measures and mandates states’ cooperation in surveillance and data sharing. It requires states to aid each other in cybercrime investigations and prosecutions, allowing the collection, preservation, and sharing of electronic evidence for any crime deemed serious by a country’s domestic law, with minimal human rights safeguards.

They are debated, often over the course of many years, by diplomats and government functionaries in Vienna or New York, and their significance is often overlooked or lost in the flood of information and news we process every day, even when they expand police powers and threaten the fundamental rights of people all over the world.</span></p>
<p><span>Such is the case with the proposed <a href="https://www.eff.org/issues/un-cybercrime-treaty">UN Cybercrime Treaty</a>. For more than two years, EFF and its international civil society partners have been deeply involved in spreading the word about, and fighting to fix, seriously dangerous flaws in the draft convention. In the coming days we will publish a series of short posts that cut through the draft’s dense, highly technical text e
