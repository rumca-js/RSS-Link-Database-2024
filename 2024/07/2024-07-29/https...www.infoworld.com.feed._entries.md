<p>During the pandemic, there was a significant uptick in the number of low-code, no-code, and process automation platforms and other business platforms that have these capabilities as features. A recent <a href="https://www.cxtoday.com/loyalty-management/gartner-magic-quadrant-for-enterprise-low-code-application-platforms-2023/">Gartner Magic Quadrant</a> ranks 17 low-code platforms targeting application and software development. <a href="https://www.creatio.com/page/2024-forrester-wave-low-code-platforms">Forrester’s Wave</a> on <a href="https://www.creatio.com/page/2024-forrester-wave-low-code-platforms">low-code platforms for citizen developers</a> ranked 12, and their report on <a href="https:

<p>Efficient <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3712227/what-is-rag-more-accurate-and-reliable-llms.html">retrieval-augmented generation</a> (RAG) requires a good vector search of the documents you’re trying to query. While almost all the major databases now include some kind of embedding algorithms, vector storage, vector indexing, and vector search, standalone vector search and storage systems such as Qdrant (pronounced “quadrant”) have their place in the market, especially for production applications.</p>



<p>Qdrant claims to offer the best available performance and handling of vectors, as well as advanced one-stage filtering, storage optimization, quantization, horizontal and vertical s

<p>It is said that the only constant is change, which is abundantly clear with the licensing of Oracle Java. Since 2018, with the introduction of a new OpenJDK release cadence and specific long-term support (LTS) versions, we’ve seen four significant modifications to both the license conditions and pricing which have had an impact on enterprises using <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3711866/11-reasons-the-new-java-is-not-like-the-old-java.html">Java</a> within their organizations.</p>



<p>Initially, we saw the introduction of the Oracle Technology Network License Agreement (OTNLA). Prior to this, everyone had considered the Java platform to be free, including maintenance in the form of r

<p>The US Department of Commerce’s National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has released a new open source software package, Dioptra, that allows developers to determine what type of attacks would make an <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/1647870/what-is-artificial-intelligence.html">AI</a> model perform less effectively.</p>



<p>“Testing the effects of adversarial attacks on <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2254843/what-is-machine-learning-intelligence-derived-from-data.html">machine learning</a> models is one of the goals of Dioptra, a new software package aimed at helping AI developers and customers determine how well their AI software stands up to a variety
