Last year's direct aired a good hour or so after the planned window, which is probably why Grasshopper hasn't yet shared a time for the presentation.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grasshopper-ma

These will all come into play when Astro Bot releases later this year (although, with more textures to feel through the controller than with Astro's Playroom). So far, so normal.</p><p>Things get a little more exciting when you get to the cosmetic side of things, however. The upcoming controller has Astro's blue accents on the handles and buttons, some sci-fi style grooves and - the most eye-catching feature in every sense - Astro's "trademark playful pair of eyes" on the DualSense's touchpad.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation

Used consoles sold on eBay and factory-reset also have the same issue. Based on our own testing from Xbox One consoles brought out of storage, systems operating on older firmware revisions error out when connected to Xbox Live. We've informed Microsoft, we're confident the problem will be fixed, but the situation raises awkward questions about the future prospects of console hardware reliant on an internet connection to fully function.</p><p>Let's be clear about what we're talking about.

The main Assassin's Creed reddit, subscribed to by more than 717,000 users, has taken a firm stance on the continuing backlash to Black samurai Yasuke protagonist in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>.
