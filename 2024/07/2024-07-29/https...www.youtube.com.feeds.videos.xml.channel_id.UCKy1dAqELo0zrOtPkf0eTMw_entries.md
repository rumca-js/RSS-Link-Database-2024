Watch our College Football 25 review by Will Borger on Xbox Series X, also available on PlayStation 5.

If you know and love college football and just want to pop into Dynasty, build up your favorite school, and play some football that looks good and handles well, College Football 25 is likely to please. But if you’re expecting a great off-the-field experience at your program of choice, you’re going to be disappointed. Sure, maybe EA will fix the UI issues, add a proper tutorial, and flesh out the modes a bit more in next year’s iteration, but promises of tomorrow aren’t certain, and they’re not what you’re buying today. College Football 25 isn’t a bad game, and the effort that has been put into its on-field action is clear, but the lack of that same care elsewhere means it’s not a great game, either. Like any good-but-not-great football team, there’s a solid foundation here; you just hope it can reach its full potential somewhere down the line.
