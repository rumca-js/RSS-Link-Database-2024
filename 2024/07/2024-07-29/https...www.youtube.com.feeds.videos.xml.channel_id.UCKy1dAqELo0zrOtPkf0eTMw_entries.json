Sure, maybe EA will fix the UI issues, add a proper tutorial, and flesh out the modes a bit more in next year\u2019s iteration, but promises of tomorrow aren\u2019t certain, and they\u2019re not what you\u2019re buying today. College Football 25 isn\u2019t a bad game, and the effort that has been put into its on-field action is clear, but the lack of that same care elsewhere means it\u2019s not a great game, either. Like any good-but-not-great football team, there\u2019s a solid foundation here; you just hope it can reach its full potential somewhere down the line.\n\n#CollegeFootball25 #Gaming #IGN", "id": 949756, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd31hYbkcOw", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "source_obj__id": 149, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/Zd31hYbkcOw/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "College Football 25 Review", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-07-29T14:30:09+00:00", "description": "Watch the Astro Bot PS5 DualSense Controller reveal trailer for a look at this upcoming limited-edition DualSense wireless controller, inspired by the dynamic design of ASTRO\u2019s trusty Dual Speeder spaceship.\n\n#PS5 #AstroBot #Gaming", "id": 949292, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpFPCpoQlG0", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "source_obj__id": 149, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/HpFPCpoQlG0/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Astro Bot PS5 DualSense Controller - Official Reveal Trailer", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-07-29T13:58:08+00:00", "description": "Here's your look at Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions gameplay in this trailer for the upcoming action game based on the magical sport from the world of Harry Potter.
