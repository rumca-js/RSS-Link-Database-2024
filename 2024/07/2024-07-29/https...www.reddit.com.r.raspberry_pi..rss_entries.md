<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey folks, I'm looking to share my findings and ask others findings around removing the Ethernet port from the board of the Pi models. The port is large and bulky and not needed in a lot of use cases. I have watched every existing video of this being done, successfully and not. </p> <p>I've successfully removed the Eth port from Raspberry Pi 4's. It takes some time but after heating each connection and using a solder 'vacuum' or remover, the port comes off successfully and clean (with some flux). I'm about to do the same to the Pi5 but have noticed that the connections which hold the Eth port onto the 5 are different from the 4. In particular there is a metal 'clip-like' piece where the connections are. On the Pi4 this didn't exist. Does anyone have there own personal experience with removing this port specifically on the Pi5? I've looked everywhere on our great internet for a long time but can find very little on this subject. All opinions are welcom

Well, I'm here to tell you that booting up a PI with an SSD is simple and straightforward. Don't overthink it like I did</p> <p>Steps:</p> <ol> <li>Assemble raspberry Pi</li> <li>Flash the SSD using the Raspberry Pi imager</li> <li>Imager allows setting things up ahead of time. e.g. WIFI, username/password, hostname..ect. This made things simple. Otherwise, you'll have to mess with the configs <em>after</em> the Pi has booted up</li> <li>Connect SSD to Pi</li> <li>Turn on Pi</li> </ol> <p>Pretty much the same as doing it with an SD Ca
