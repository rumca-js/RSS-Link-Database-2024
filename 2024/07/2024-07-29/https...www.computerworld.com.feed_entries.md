<p>The CrowdStrike incident that affected more than 8.5 million Windows PCs worldwide and forced users to face the “Blue Screen of Death,” made Microsoft sit down and revisit the resilience of its operating system.</p>



<p>The company is now prioritizing the reduction of kernel-level access for software applications, a move designed to enhance the overall security and resilience of the Windows operating system, as part of its post-CrowdStrike attempt to make its security architecture more resilient and robust.</p>

<p>“And, who loses? Yup, patients,” said Dr. Ashish Kumar Jha, dean of the School of Public Health at Brown University. More often than not, clinicians have historically simply given up once their appeals are denied.</p>
