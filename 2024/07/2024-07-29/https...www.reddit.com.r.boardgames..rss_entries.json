I want things to be done according to the rules even for actions that don't directly involve my pieces. It sometimes feels rude to interrupt someone's turn to correct them on something or say &quot;I'm not sure that's correct, can we check the rules?&quot;, but in my head, playing according to the game's rules is the reason to play the game, and playing correctly is the best way to learn the rules. I'm probably on the more rules-adherent side of things (I promise I'm fun too!), so I wonder what other people's feelings on the matter are, and how they justify those feelings. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a hre", "id": 950317, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1ef5kqy/what_is_your_groups_etiquette_around_rules", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/.rss", "source_obj__id": 473, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "What is your group's etiquette around rules lookups mid-game?", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-07-29T17:32:36+00:00", "description": "<table> <tr><td> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1ef5i2w/huang_base_edition_storag/\"> <img alt=\"Huang Base Edition Storag\" src=\"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/TciV0RLC1JBbkzeUHX_9uPfT_vYKXTkOwPFBTtEsTlc.jpg\" title=\"Huang Base Edition Storag\" /> </a> </td><td> <!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I cannot for the life of me figure out the best way to store Huang (I have the base edition).
