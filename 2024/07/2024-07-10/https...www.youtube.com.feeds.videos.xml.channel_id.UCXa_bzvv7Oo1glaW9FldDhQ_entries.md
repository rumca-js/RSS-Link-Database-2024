Depending on your looter shooter preference, The First Descendant is either easy to slip into and waste a few hours, despisable or repetitive. Regardless, it's captured a sizable audience since launching on consoles and PC, one that keeps returning and having fun.

Maybe it's a distinct lack of matchmaking for Infiltration Operations on Hard mode (which Nexon is addressing soon). Perhaps it's the utter lack of free premium currency.

It may even be a fundamental issue with the performance on PC or the Descendant Instructor talking way too fast for anyone to learn anything. Here are ten things hardcore players dislike about The First Descendant and what a new player should know before jumping in.
