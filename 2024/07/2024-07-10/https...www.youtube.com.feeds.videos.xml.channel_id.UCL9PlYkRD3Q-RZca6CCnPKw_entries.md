“Biden doesn’t want to pass this regulation [menthol cigarette ban] because he’s worried he will lose Black voters.”

Menthol cigarettes kill thousands of Black Americans every year but President Biden would rather win their votes than save their lives, as explained by the trial attorney defending the U.S. government in a lawsuit brought by public health groups.
