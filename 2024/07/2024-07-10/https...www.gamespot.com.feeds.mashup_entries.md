<p>With just a single episode of Season 1 of Star Wars: The Acolyte remaining, it feels as though this series has been prompting lots of questions without ever really answering any of them in full. The show is full of mysteries, and it's offered only partial answers to go with them. We know a lot about <em>what</em> is going on but very little about <em>why</em>. And without the why, we don't really know anything, even after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-acolyte-episode-7-another-flashback-more-big-secrets-and-some-surprising-star-wars-easter-eggs/2900-5584/">our second flashback of the season in this week's episode</a>.</p><p><strong>Warning: This article discusses many spoilers for Star Wars: The Acolyte through Episode 7, "Choice."</strong></p><p dir="ltr">The cause of this knowledge gap comes courtesy of The Acolyte's strange plot structure.

<p>In 1986, Alan Moore and artist Dave Gibbons revolutionized superhero comics with Watchmen, a 12-part miniseries that influenced the genre for decades afterwards. Now, Warner Bros. Animation's upcoming two-part movie adaptation is giving Moore and Gibbons' story a fresh adaptation that may be able to go further than Zack Snyder's 2009 film. And in the new trailer below, several moments from the Watchmen comic are recreated in stunning detail.</p><div>          </div><p>Because Snyder's film was largely faithful to the comic--minus some changes to the ending--this trailer may give some viewers a sensation of Deja vu. The reason a lot of the scenes appear similar to Snyder's movie is because both adaptations are drawing upon Gibbons' artwork. It just seems a little more fitting in this format.</p><p>Babylon 5 creator J. Michael Straczynski wrote the script for the two Watchmen animated films, which will be directed by Brandon Vietti.

<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is not the only tactical espionage action on the horizon. Black State is a third-person action stealth game clearly taking some cues from Metal Gear, both with its surreal, sci-fi tone and its MGS5-esque gameplay. Alas, none of the marketing has shown any giant robots (yet).</p><p>Black State is the first game from developer Motion Blur, an independent AAA studio based in Istanbul. Apparently the game will have few loading screens, using doors as portals to transition to and from a diverse set of areas. This acts both as a plot device and visual hook. The story itself concerns a soldier summoned by a group of scientists called The Architects for a mysterious hostage mission who encounters strange doors that teleport him across impossible distances. Other plot details are vague, though the trailer does show some of the characters you may meet including a Colonel Campbell-esque commanding officer heard in voiceover and an old man surrounded by cloc

This week, we got our second episode of the season that is spent entirely on the night that Mae and Osha's coven met the Jedi--and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-acolyte-episode-3-major-star-wars-easter-eggs-and-story-connections/2900-5469/">like with Episode 3</a>, this one did not actually tell us everything that happened.</p><p dir="ltr">I've enjoyed The Acolyte thus far, but we're now hurtling toward the end of the season--there's only one more episode remaining, and there's just no way they can bring the season's story to any sort of conclusion in another half-hour of TV. It's looking very much like Season 1 of The Acolyte, like Ahsoka last year, is simply going to stop, rather than wrap things up in any way.</p><p

<p>Author George R.R. Martin has once again provided an update on the next A Song of Ice and Fire book, The Winds of Winter, and no one should be surprised that the book still is not finished.</p><p>Posting on his <a href="https://georgerrmartin.com/notablog/2024/07/09/on-the-road-again-5/">blog</a>, Martin said that in 2023, when he visited his publishers from Harper Collins Voyager in London, people assumed the book was nearly done and that an announcement about its release was coming. But that's not how this works, Martin said.</p><p>He pointed out that when he travels the world for his various speaking engagements and appearances, he schedules time with his publishers, editors, and agents to have face-to-face sitdowns purely to maintain and build these relationships. Communicating over Zoom and email is all well and good, but when Martin travels, he likes to sit down and chat. </p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/george-r-r-martin-gives-update-on-winds-of-winter-and-you-
