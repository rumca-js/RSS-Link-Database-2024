How does an LLM AI actually work? If you understand the underpinnings of an AI, you will actually be able bring out the extra capabilities of your local AI. You can make it smarter, have long term conversations, overcome censorship and really give you more accurate solutions. But you need to understand its construction and its limits first before you can accomplish that.

I have watched people use AI and because they don't know what is actually happening, they waste time, and lose the actual value possible with this new technology. Some people say that local models cannot compete with the huge paid cloud models and you will find that this is not actually true.

In this video, we assume that the AI is locally based using Ollama and so much of the privacy and security issues have already been alleviated.
