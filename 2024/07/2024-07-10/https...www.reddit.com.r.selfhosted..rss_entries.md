The instances scale down automatically after each workload.</p> <p>You can also do things like deploy web endpoints, run task queues, and mount storage volumes for accessing large datasets.</p> <p>We designed this platform for HPC and AI/ML workloads. You can run Beta9 on an existing cluster with GPU (or CPU) nodes, or you can plug-in additional GPU nodes from any external cloud provider.</p> <p>If you have feedback or feature ideas, we would love to hear them.

But that's a whole other story.</p> <p>The gateway has a new type of architecture that allows packet manipulation (one of the reasons for Golang), which basically means you can programmatically change contents of connections in real-time.</p> <p>Therefore it enables a whole set of problems to be consolidated at the access gateway layer, like data access policies (DLP), review of critical operations before they run (Change Management), automate repeat operations (Runbooks) and more. And this is how we monetize the solution.</p> <p>Because of that we're open-sourcing the core of the gateway under MIT license. And we're including enterprise features from other gateways and some unique and new options enabled by our architecture.</p> <p>Our vision for the project is to do what nginx did for HTTP to the prot

One of the things I want to do is use it as a virtual development environment that I can remotely access from different machines whenever I want.</p> <p>Now I can set it up so I can rdp into it every time I want to code on it but that can be a little laggy. I was thinking of whether there would be a way to connect an IDE to it. Wandering around I found code-server and gitpod.</p> <p>I'm looking for something that's a hybrid between code-server and gitpod. I want the ability to make changes to the code right from the browser like code-server but I also like how gitpod instead gives you the choice of what IDE to open in. I guess I want both options there. Gitpod would be a perfect solution for me if I could self-host it onto my server and it would also provide the option to open the code in vscode.dev.</p> <p>A
