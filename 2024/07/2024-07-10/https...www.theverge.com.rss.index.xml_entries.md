  <p id="UZHf7M">Alongside its latest folding phones and wearables, Samsung is introducing the new Galaxy Buds 3 Pro and Galaxy Buds 3. As leaks (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/5/24192554/someone-already-bought-samsungs-galaxy-buds3-pro">and early sales</a>) confirmed, the company has moved away from the subtle in-ear design of past generations to a stemmed look that gives these an AirPods-esque look and feel — especially in white. Both earbuds also come in a gunmetal gray finish that, combined with the angular “blade” design, makes me think of Tesla’s Cybertruck. But there’s no denying the overall similarities to Apple’s massively popular AirPods. </p>

  <p id="59SmZ0">The “Music Dance Experience” is on its way back. Apple just released the first teaser trailer for the much-anticipated second season of <em>Severance</em>, along with the news that the show won’t be returning until 2025. The first episode will start streaming on Apple TV Plus on January 17th and last 10 episodes.</p>
<p id="V0D2b6">The short teaser doesn’t reveal much about what to expect in the new season, but according to Apple, “Mark (Adam Scott) and his friends learn the dire consequences of trifling with the severance barrier, leading them further down a path of woe.”</p>
