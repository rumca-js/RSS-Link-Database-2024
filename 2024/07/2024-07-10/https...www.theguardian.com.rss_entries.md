I think there should be a solution that falls short of that.”</p><p>That statement raises more questions than it answers, unfortunately. Which type of nationalisation would Labour not wish to see?

<p>Yes he’s a nepo baby, but 13-year-old Buddy Oliver tackles something that would terrify most adult chefs: letting kids loose with sharp implements on camera</p><p>It’s possible that Jamie Oliver’s production company did not perform an exhaustive auditioning process before hiring the host of their new CBBC show. In Cooking Buddies, a teen presenter meets someone who is roughly his own age and teaches them how to cook a dish, which they then make for their family. In return, the guest gives the presenter a crash course in their favourite hobby. That presenter is Buddy Oliver, a 13-year-old food YouTuber who is also Jamie’s son.</p><p>Cookery telly is already disproportionately Oliver-flavoured, to some viewers’ distaste. Now there is a new generation of cheeky chappy to contend with, and a new “nepo baby” to discuss. But, sadly for those ready to dump on Cooking Buddies, it points up the flipside of the idea that flooding our culture with the children of the famous – and more broadly

<p>Director Chris Nash departs from genre cliches to deliver a fascinatingly different slasher movie in which danger strikes amid the beauty of the great outdoors</p><p>A man in a mask is out to get you; that’s the basic drill, and horror fans know it – they love the drill, they worship the drill, they have an endless, insatiable appetite for the drill. But that doesn’t mean that you can’t appreciate innovative variations on the premise: an original choice of weapon, perhaps, or particularly haunting motivation, or indeed a memorable mask. Chris Nash’s low-budget slasher qualifies as one of the more interesting formal variations; the weapons are not unusual (hooks feature prominently), the motivation is fairly standard (a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/oct/12/friday-the-13th-review-original-teen-horror-classic-now-looks-bizarrely-innocent">Jason</a>-style past wrong), and a fun but not that outlandish mask (a vintage firefighter’s mask).

But defining what kind of work it really is, and therefore how it should be presented, is not straightforward. These expressionist settings of 21 poems by Albert Giraud (sung in German translations from French) certainly do not add up to a fully fledged theatre piece, even though at their first performance in Berlin in 1912 the soloist was alone on stage dressed in a Pierrot costume, with the instrumentalists hidden behind a screen, but also it’s much more than a straightforward

<p><strong>Southwark Playhouse Elephant, London<br /></strong>Soulful anthems with hard-knock lyrics cover 150 years of British care system history in a sophisticated show from Lung theatre company</p><p>We’re a long way from Annie. <a href="https://southwarkplayhouse.co.uk/productions/the-childrens-inquiry/">The Children’s Inquiry</a> is a questing musical about kids in care – there are no moppet antics or life-changing benefactors. Instead, the pioneering theatre company <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/aug/10/woodhill-britain-failing-prison-system-summerhall-edinburgh">Lung</a> pursue the changing British care system over 150 years, exposing the heartbreakingly arbitrary way in which children’s fates can be sealed. It’s drenched in disappointment yet somehow hangs on to hope.</p><p>Four young people shared their stories with writers Helen Monks and Matt Woodhead. Threading through the piece, they remind you that children in care can be living other people’s bad choic

<ul><li>Men’s Friday and Sunday fixtures could be scrapped</li><li>Staggering kick-offs would boost TV ratings </li></ul><p>All future men’s Six Nations fixtures could be staged on Saturdays as rugby union officials seek to enhance the championship’s pulling power. It is understood serious consideration is being given to scrapping Friday and Sunday games and instead expanding the use of popular final weekend Super Saturday concept.</p><p>Staggering the kick-offs and playing an entire three-game round on the same day has proved a significant television ratings success, while the seven most-watched games of the 2024 Six Nations were all Saturday kick-offs. Conversely, the three men’s Six Nations matches with the lowest TV audiences in the UK this year – Wales v France, Ireland v Italy and Italy v France – were all played on Sundays.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/jul/10/six-nations-saturday-only-tests-revamp-boost-rugby-pulling-power">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A young female writer is drawn into the family of a revered novelist and patriarch, in this powerfully compelling dissection of the creative process</p><p>A sultry August in Sicily in 1999 provides the initial setting for Marina Kemp’s powerfully compelling second novel. The court of the revered novelist and patriarch Don Travers – his four children; his silent, apparently surrendered wife Lydia; and a revolving guestlist of the great and good, the influential, the useful and the up-and-coming – is in situ at Il&nbsp;Frantoio, the rambling villa the family takes every summer.</p><p>At 10 years old, the youngest Travers daughter, Nemony – feeling left out, as youngest children often do&nbsp;– is our first and principal narrator. The second is a young writer, Zoe Goodison, whose first novel has recently been published to high praise.
