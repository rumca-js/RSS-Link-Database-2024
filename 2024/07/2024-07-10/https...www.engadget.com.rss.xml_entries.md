<p>Most subscription sites use "dark patterns" to influence customer behavior around subscriptions and personal data, according to a pair of new reports from global consumer protection groups. Dark patterns are "practices commonly found in online user interfaces [that] steer, deceive, coerce or manipulate consumers into making choices that often are not in their best interests." The international research efforts were conducted by the International Consumer Protection and Enforcement Network (ICPEN) and the Global Privacy Enforcement Network (GPEN).</p>
<p>The ICPEN conducted the <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/07/ftc-icpen-gpen-announce-results-review-use-dark-patterns-affecting-subscription-services-privacy"><ins>review</ins></a> of 642 websites and mobile apps with a subscription component. The assessment revealed one dark pattern in use at almost 76 percent of the platforms, and multiple dark patterns at play in almost 68

<p>Google and Apple are <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://dtinit.org/blog/2024/07/10/DTI-members-new-photo-video-tool">launching</a> a new tool to transfer images from Google Photos to iCloud. As part of the Data Transfer Initiative (DTI), the tool will add iCloud transfers to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-09-26-google-takeout-redesign.html">Google Takeout’s</a> export options. <em>9to5Mac</em> first <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/07/10/transfer-from-google-photos-to-icloud-photos/">spotted</a> the announcement.</p>
<p>The tool, which will roll out over the next week, automates the transfer process from Google Photos to iCloud, so you don’t have to download, upload or do anything beyond initiating the process on the web. An Apple support page <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213483">says</a> it could take several hours to a few days to complete, depending on the transfer size.</p>

<p>Get ready to feel old and/or cluttered, depending on how many consoles are hooked up to your game room TV right now. The Xbox 360 Store and Marketplace are coming to a close later this month. Microsoft announced this last year and put an official end date of July 29, according to <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/xbox-360/store/xbox-360-marketplace-update#:~:text=Check%20here%20for%20the%20known,you%20can%20do%20about%20them.&amp;text=The%20Xbox%20360%20Store%20and,retired%20on%20July%2029%2C%202024.">its official FAQ page</a>. In case you didn’t notice, the end of July is fast approaching.</p>
<p>All of the games, DLC and any gaming tidbits for Microsoft’s second generation console won’t be available to purchase or download on the Xbox 360 console. Your games and movie purchases are still safe, however, if you’ve got any throwback titles on your Xbox One or Series X/S console. You can also still watch your purchased movies and shows on Windows 10 and 11 devices.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, Amazon claimed that it reached its goal of sourcing all its power from clean energy sources in the past year. If taken at face value, the announcement would mean it hit the milestone <em>seven years</em> ahead of schedule, which would be a monumental achievement. But <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/10/business/energy-environment/amazon-clean-energy-climate-change.html">environmental experts speaking to</a> <em>The New York Times</em>, including a group of concerned Amazon employees, warn that the company is “misleading the public by distorting the truth.”</p>
<p>The company’s claim of achieving 100 percent clean electricity is based in part on billion-dollar investments in over 500 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/wind-solar-energy-needs-study-172901659.html">solar and wind initiatives</a>. The company’s logic is that the energy these projects generate equals the electricity its data centers consume — ergo, even Steven.</p>

<p>Learning in college is as much about life lessons as it is about the lectures. It might be the first time you’re managing things on your own — particularly your finances — and as you apply for jobs and search for apartments, you may also be increasing the amount of personal data you put online. We gathered up the budgeting apps we have tried and ultimately recommend, as well as services that can help you keep track of passwords and protect your online activities. These are all tools we wish we’d known to use when we headed off as undergrads, and hopefully they’ll make the adulting parts of college a little more manageable.</p>

The fitness tracker app has launched<a href="https://www.strava.com/family"> its family plan</a>, a subscription tier allowing up to four accounts on one plan. It includes everything an individual plan has, such as route building and sharing, activity recording and safety tools.</p>

<p>Have you heard the song that goes “anything you can do I can do better, I can do anything better than you?” Well, it seems like the folks at Samsung have been listening to that on repeat. At its Galaxy Unpacked event today, the company unveiled a slew of products, including a few wearables that look remarkably familiar. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-unveils-the-galaxy-ring-as-a-way-to-simplify-everyday-wellness-080134421.html">Galaxy Ring</a>, which was teased in January, appears to be inspired by <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oura-ring-version-3-150032257.html">the Oura Ring</a>. Meanwhile, the new Galaxy Watch Ultra seems to have borrowed many traits from a competing product at Apple, right down to its name.</p>
<p>The resemblance doesn’t end there, but there are a few key differences between Samsung and Apple’s high-end smartwatches. From my recent hands-on experience, though, Samsung’s latest wearables don’t seem to bring many new things to its familiar-look

<p>Samsung's new Galaxy Buds lineup is hardly a surprise thanks to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/images-of-unannounced-samsung-watches-and-earbuds-appear-to-have-leaked-171013394.html">a recent leak</a>, but the company still had to officially debut its latest audio accessory at its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-unpacked-2024-liveblog-galaxy-watch-ultra-z-fold-6-z-flip-6-galaxy-ring-and-more-070036972.html">Samsung Galaxy Unpacked</a> event. Alongside new folding phones, watches and even a smart ring, Samsung revealed the Galaxy Buds 3 series. The new models have a more AirPods-like look thanks to their stickbud or "blade" design, and Samsung is playing catch-up with new features like an Interpreter tool, Adaptive EQ and others.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Until now, Samsung has opted for the more common, rounded earbud design most companies favor for their products. The stick-based look has become increasingly popular though, and much of Apple's competition have debuted their own t

<p>There’s no such thing as a watch party with a laptop screen. If you’re the sort of person who enjoys watching movies and TV shows with friends, then it’s worth nabbing an inexpensive TV for your dorm room. And if you’re living alongside other students with too much time on their hands, you’ll want a TV for impromptu <em>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</em> sessions. (If you need another justification, or just a way to sell it to your parents, TV sets can easily be repurposed as secondary monitors for any computer). Below, we’ve gathered some of the best TV and home entertainment options for students — ones that provide a great experience without emptying your wallet.</p>

<p>Microsoft has withdrawn from OpenAI's board of directors a couple of weeks after the European Commission revealed that it's taking another look at the terms of their partnership, according to the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ecfa69df-5d1c-4177-9b14-a3a73072db12"><em>Financial Times</em></a>. The company has reportedly sent OpenAI a letter, announcing that it was giving up its seat &quot;effective immediately.&quot; Microsoft took on an observer, non-voting role within OpenAI's board following an internal upheaval that led to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/openai-ceo-sam-altman-ousted-as-board-no-longer-has-confidence-in-his-leadership-204924006.html">firing</a> (and eventual <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sam-altman-is-back-on-the-openai-board-we-still-dont-know-why-he-was-fired-002358008.html">reinstatement</a>) of the latter's CEO, Sam Altman.&nbsp;</p>

<p>US officials and their allies have identified and taken down an artificial intelligence-powered <a href="https://www.engadget.com/us-officials-announce-the-takedown-of-an-ai-powered-russian-bot-farm-054034912.html">Russian bot farm</a> comprising almost 1,000 accounts. These accounts were able to spread disinformation and pro-Russian sentiments across X, formerly Twitter. The Justice Department has revealed the scheme was made possible by software created by a digital media department in RT, a Russian state-controlled media outlet.</p>
<p>According to a cybersecurity advisory from the FBI, intelligence officers from the Netherlands, and cybersecurity authorities from Canada, it centered on a tool called Meliorator, which can create “authentic appearing social media personas en masse,” generate text messages as well as images and mirror disinformation from other bot personas. For example, one account with the name Ricardo Abbott, which claimed to be from Minneapolis, posted a video

<p>Google is adding <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/passkeys-passwords-authentication-security-133024414.html"><ins>passkey</ins></a> support to its Advanced Protection Program. APP is the company's highest-level security option. It's intended for targets who could be at high risk of hacks or other scams, such as elected officials or human rights workers, and it previously required a physical security key to use. In Google's <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/google-passkeys-advanced-protection-program/"><ins>announcement</ins></a> today, it acknowledged that the physical component made APP less feasible for some of the people who need the service most. Now, people who enroll in APP can opt for a passkey or for a physical key.</p>
