Here's how to convert copper to PEX B: 

1. Use water-soluble flux: Apply Oatey H-20 water-soluble flux to both the copper pipe and the sweat adapter. 

2. Wipe off excess flux: Before soldering, be sure to wipe off any excess flux with a clean rag. 

3. Flame protection is crucial: For safety, always use a flame protector pad inside the stud wall when soldering. This prevents accidental fires.
