 The person spoke on condition of anonymity Wednesday because US Soccer Federation had not yet made the announcement.<br /><br />
 Berhalter’s second term as coach was cut short 10 months after he returned to the bench with high hopes and proclaimed the team’s goal was “to change soccer in America for ever.” The US had seven wins, six losses and one draw in his second stint, leaving his overall record at 44 wins, 17 losses and 13 draws.</p><p>Technical director Matt Crocker <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/16/us-socce-gregg-berhalter-usmnt-manager">rehired Berhalter</a>

I base this view on my own schooldays, my children’s, their friends’, and the children of my friends.

This Indigenous Quichua community is carved out of the dense Amazonian rainforest along the Tiputini River.

<p>In this free-to-play gacha game, Earth’s survivors balance dystopian battles with cute moments helping locals <br /><strong>miHoYo/HoYoverse; PC, PS5, smartphones</strong></p><p>One of the biggest revolutions in the modern video game industry has taken place almost out of sight of your average console gamer. The rise of the free-to-play gacha game, in which you pay either real or in-game money for randomised bundles of characters and weapons, has been meteoric in the Chinese market, dominated by publishers such as miHoYo, NetEase and Yostar. The most successful such games, including Genshin Impact, Arknights and Another Eden, have tens of millions of players, mostly on smartphones, and draw vast incomes from those willing to pay to complete their collections of in-game items.</p><p>Recently, the genre has been expanding beyond mobile, and Zenless Zone Zero is the latest example.

<p>Bringing in proportional representation is the best way of defending and rebuilding the legitimacy of our democracy</p><p>The classic argument for a first past the post (FPTP) voting system was that it kept the cranks at bay and delivered a stable, two-party system, with a third, challenger party that would give the impression of alternative options. It smacked of a slightly imperfect democracy even in the 20th century, when political allegiances were more fixed at an individual level, and the dominant parties differentiated themselves quite effortlessly at an ideological level. It was a system of representation that justified itself mainly on the principle that it wasn’t broke so why fix it, and when really pressed, used the spectre of some outliers who were too dangerous to be represented in parliament.</p><p>Yet whenever a fringe group found its voice some other way – in a local election or protest movement – it was often overtly racist. The National Front had the fourth-largest

<p>From Arab scholars to hippy mothers, can history offer forgotten answers to modern problems?</p><p>We need lessons from history now more than ever. Mothers with young children sit isolated in their own homes, oblivious to 1970s experiments in communal child-rearing. Broadcasters justify populist content on the grounds that it’s what “ordinary people” want, despite the rich 19th-century tradition of working-class intellectualism. The current Labour leadership’s adherence to strict “fiscal rules” disregards past successes of borrowing to invest and taxing the highest incomes at 90%. These histories allow us to see that contemporary evils such as austerity and inequality are contingent, not inevitable: it doesn’t have to be this way.</p><p>The mindfulness mantra to ‘live in the present’ distracts us from the real problem: we are not living enough in the past. The perpetual ‘now’ of online life erodes our collective memory. Historical novels and TV series are in demand, but often as ve
