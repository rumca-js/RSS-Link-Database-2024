Frank Turner released his tenth studio album, 'Undefeated,' on May 3, 2024, but just a couple weeks earlier — on Record Store Day, specifically — Turner found himself in the Twin Cities where he worked a shift and played a show at the Electric Fetus in Minneapolis, where he played a number of songs from the then-forthcoming record.

The following day, Turner visited The Current studio where he performed his song "Show People".
