This is the place where we have so often played some of the most unique games of our lifetimes over the years, games that we are going to remember forever for how singular they were.

Regardless, it's captured a sizable audience since launching on consoles and PC, one that keeps returning and having fun.\n\nThis isn't to say there aren't things to fix or issues that can be left unchecked, but if you poured dozens of hours since launch, The First Descendant may have a few annoying quirks. Maybe it's a distinct lack of matchmaking for Infiltration Operations on Hard mode (which Nexon is addressing soon). Perhaps it's the utter lack of free premium currency.\n\nIt may even be a fundamental issue with the performance on PC or the Descendant Instructor talking way too fast for anyone to learn anything.
