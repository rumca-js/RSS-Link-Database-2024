You don’t even have to win, just play the game. I am sure you would, as $1 million to a charity would drastically change the game for most causes (unless it’s something like the Hilton Foundation). But Biden did more than say no to helping out a nonprofit in need, he did what the left does best, which is lie, deflect, and gaslight. </p><p>You see, during the debat

As the White House Press Corps has been getting increasingly chirpy at Karine Jean-Pierre, Doocy hasn't had much to say at press briefings. That ended on Tuesday with a poignant question. Say there is a nuclear attack and Joe Biden is sleeping. Who gets the phone call? </p><p>Doocy's silence was odd since he's usually the one that tends to ask the difficult questions, while the other journalimers do their best to carry water for Biden.

So conspicuous, the Left and the media (but I repeat myself) have practically been begging him to say anything. They tried to turn it into an attack because Joe Biden has done eleventy public appearances to Trump's zero, ignoring that those elventy appearances were why Trump was all like, "Nah, I'mma let Joe have the spotlight."</p><p>The former president returned to the stage on Tuesday, and if THIS is the Trump we get over the next few mont
