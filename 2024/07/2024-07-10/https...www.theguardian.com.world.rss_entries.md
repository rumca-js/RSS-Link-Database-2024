<p>Comptonatus chasei roamed island 125m years ago and is most complete dinosaur fossil found in UK in a century</p><p>A new species of large plant-eating dinosaur that roamed the Isle of Wight about 125m years ago has been identified.<br /><br />
 The specimen, which weighed as much as an African elephant, represents the most complete dinosaur discovered in the UK in a century with 149 bones in total, researchers said.<br /><br />
 Comptonatus chasei, named after the late fossil hunter Nick Chase and the place where it was found, the cliffs of Compton Bay, belongs to a group of herbivorous dinosaurs known as iguanodontians, bulky creatures often described as the “cows of the Cretaceous period [145-66 m years ago]” by palaeontologists.<br /><br />
 Jeremy Lockwood, a PhD student at the University of Portsmouth, said: “This animal would have been around a tonne (1,000kg), about as big as a large male American bison.<br /><br />
