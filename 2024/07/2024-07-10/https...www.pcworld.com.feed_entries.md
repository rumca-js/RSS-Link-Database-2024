<p>Keeping track of your leaked data online is a thankless task, which is why services that monitor the dark web for your info have sprung up. Some are free, like the venerable site <a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=111346X1569483&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://haveibeenpwned.com/&amp;xcust=2-1-2392524-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Have I Been Pwned</a>, while others are paid services or included with paid software (like antivirus suites).</p>



<p>Even Google has gotten in on the game with dark web monitoring for paid Google One subscribers.</p>



<p>But that&rsquo;s soon going to change as later this month Google&rsquo;s dark web reports will become <a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=111346X1569483&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://support.google.com/googleone/answer/14806901?hl=en&amp;xcust=2-1-2392524-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcwo

<p>The Xbox as a console might not be doing so hot lately, but Xbox Game Pass is still the best deal in gaming&mdash;if you know about it. If you don&rsquo;t, that&rsquo;s due to Microsoft&rsquo;s increasingly bad branding.</p>



<p>After yet another round of price increases (which will sound familiar to anyone who&rsquo;s been subscribed to TV streaming services as of late), Xbox Game Pass has gotten even more confusing.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re a Prime member, you can get these two USB-C cables for just $9&mdash;down from their regular price of $14&mdash;and enjoy sitting with your phone or laptop six feet away from the outlet.</p>



<p>While short charging cables can be nice to have in clutter-free spaces, you&rsquo;re going to want longer cables when you&rsquo;re lying on your couch or winding down in bed. That&rsquo;s when 6-feet cables come in.</p>

<p>Keyboards that hide full computer guts under the keys aren&rsquo;t a new idea. (The Commodore 64 comes to mind, though it&rsquo;s hardly the only example.) And neither are folding keyboards for mobile devices, since I remember such oddities back in the days of the Palm Pilot.</p>



<p>But a boom in mobile tech and portable power has allowed one gadget maker to combine the two ideas into one.</p>

<p>Artificial intelligence requires a lot of energy. This isn&rsquo;t only true for Microsoft, but all other tech companies as well&mdash;and by 2027, the wor
