This strategic implementation of game mechanics and systems to non-game applications is prevalent in almost every modern system - technical or otherwise.\n\nHowever, recent research has shone a spotlight on the dark side of gamification and unveiled the damage it can do to its audience. In this talk, we\u2019ll explore the unseen side of gamification, explore its consequences, and discuss how best to counteract them.\n\nSlides: https://accu.org/conf-previous/accu2024/\nSponsored By think-cell\n---\n\nChar Ryder\n\nProud to be a course representative for 10 years running, Char is a passionate individual who excels at communication and organisation.

In this talk, we will explore how the historical development of 3D graphics has profoundly influenced our cultural landscape. Tracing the journey from early video games to blockbuster films and virtual reality experiences, we will uncover the pivotal moments and technological breakthroughs that have reshaped our perceptions of art, entertainment, and communication. Through a blend of historical analysis, industry insights, and cultural critique, attendees will gain a deeper understanding of how 3D graphics have not only transformed the way we create and consume media but also influenced societal norms, trends, and values.\n\nSlides: https://accu.org/conf-previous/accu2024/\nSponsored By th", "id": 840918, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T7r6zWWUBw", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCJhay24LTpO1s4bIZxuIqKw", "source_obj__id": 421, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/0T7r6zWWUBw/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Shaping Perception - The Evolution of 3D Graphics and Cultural Transformation - Ben Kyd - ACCU 2024", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-07-10T12:00:01+00:00", "description": "ACCU Membership: https://tinyurl.com/ydnfkcyn\n---\n\nAmplifying Black Women's Voices - Building Inclusive Tech Spaces Beyond Tokenism - Yemi Adenekan - ACCU 2024\n---\n\nThe tech sector deprives itself of the smartness and the diversity of black women although it needs them.
