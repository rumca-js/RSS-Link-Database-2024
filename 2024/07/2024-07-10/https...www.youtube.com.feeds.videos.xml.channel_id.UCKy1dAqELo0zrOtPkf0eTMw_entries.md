In today's Daily Fix:
Xbox Game Pass is getting another price hike, and a new subscription tier (well technically it's replacing an existing one). If you were hoping to play Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 on Day One for "free," you'll need to subscribe to Game Pass Ultimate, which will now be $19.99 a month. Sorry, lower-tiered subscription folks, no Day One games for you anymore. On the PlayStation side, new PS Plus games for July have been announced, and it's a good mix of action, adveture, rpg, and sports. Something for everyone. And finally, Nintendo posted a teaser for a mysterious horror game...which definitely seems out of character for the House of Mario, but it piqued our interest.
