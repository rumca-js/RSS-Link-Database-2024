		Hong Kong and Australia have made efforts to introduce digital identity – the former by supporting the iAM Smart app and the latter by investing in the World Bank’s digital ID infrastructure plan. Meanwhile, Singapore and Vietnam fight banking scammers, including those trying to capture customers’ biometrics.
<h2>Digital ID essential for Hong Kong’s financial center status, says FSDC</h2>
Digital identity is “crucial” for Hong Kong's strategy to become a leading international financial center, according to a new report published by a government-founded advisory body which may give wind to the city’s iAM Smart digital ID.

The Financial Services Development Council (FSDC) says that introducing digital IDs would ensure transaction security, improve efficiency and increa

		Asian biometrics developers continue to join the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology’s (NIST’s) facial recognition tests, with three new companies contributing algorithms to the latest evaluations.

Both the 1:1 Verification and 1:N Identification tracks of the Face Recognition Technology Evaluation (FRTE) were updated with new reports on July 3. The reports show continued improvement in match rates overall, and the top performers are mostly the same as in other recent editions of the reports. A relative newcomer in the top of the 1:1 Verification leaderboard is Dubai developer <a href="https://viante.ai/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Viante.AI</a>, which placed in the top 5 in several categories with an algorithm submitted in June.

		Biometric data is personal data. It is sensitive personal information. It can be used by hackers to open accounts using another person’s face, and in combination with a breached ID document, using a victim’s identity.

You cannot change your face if an image of it is stolen.

These facts are sometimes presented together as an argument that face biometrics should not be used, or that biometric templates are among the most dangerous type of data that can be breached.

These arguments are invalid. Their conclusions do not follow from the facts.  Stolen face biometrics templates are not a greater risk to the privacy and account security of the subject than the photo on their social media profile; in fact, quite the opposite.

Digital technology is ever-evolving and relied upon for many everyday tasks. Safety, convenience, and ease of use have been the key drivers for this trend, especially for transactions requiring identification. And one of the most used documents to confirm identity and proof of age is now going digital – the driver's license.

During the last few years, studies and pilots have been conducted around the world to explore the technical feasibility of a digital driver's license. For example, Florida has adopted the Florida Smart ID as a means to not only prove identity, but to be used in lieu of a
