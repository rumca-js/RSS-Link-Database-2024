Customers in the U.S. and Canada will see a $5 hike for regular memberships (now $65 per year) and a $10 increase for executive memberships (now $130 per year). Costco is the latest retailer to bump up membership fees in the face of rising costs. Could Amazon be next? The Seattle tech giant last raised Prime membership fees in February 2022, upping the price from $119 per year to $139 per year. That increase was meant to help offset some of Amazon’s rising&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/costco-raises-membership-fees-is-amazon-prime-next/">Read More</a>

Eric Elfman, who joined MoxiWorks as CEO in early June, told Real Estate News that many vendors have become &#8220;fat, dumb and happy&#8221; operating in the old world of real estate technology, and that needs to change — particularly given the rapid growth of artificial intelligence. &#8220;A lot of vendors were caught flat-footed… when OpenAI and generative AI really boomed onto the market.

The agreement is being called the largest single carbon removal agreement ever made. The deal is with 1PointFive, which is building a direct air capture (DAC) facility at its Stratos plant in Texas. The site is to begin operations next year, according to Bloomberg. 1PointFive announced the deal Tuesday. Microsoft set a goal of becoming carbon negative by 2030, but its emissions keep rising, driven by the growing use of artificial intelligence and tools such as ChatGPT.

The decision, reported Wednesday morning, comes about eight months after Microsoft took on the role as part of the reformulated board after the short-lived ouster of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. It also comes amid heightened regulatory scrutiny of investments in AI companies by tech giants including Microsoft and Amazon. However, Reuters cites an unnamed Federal Trade Commission source saying that the change in Microsoft&#8217;s status&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/microsoft-relinquishes-role-as-openai-board-observer-amid-regulatory-scrutiny-of-ai-investments/">Read More</a

Juicer&#8217;s leaders have decades of experience founding billion-dollar startups and leading teams at tech giants. GeekWire spotted a new SEC filing posted this week that revealed a new investment round for the company, which incorporated this past August. The company&#8217;s website details a &#8220;charge anywhere&#8221; experience powered by EV chargers that are installed at apartments and houses. Juicer says it can &#8220;enable onsite EV charging 10X cheaper than existing solutions&#8221; and help residential real estate owners generate incremental revenue.

In its annual sustainability report, the cloud, e-commerce and entertainment giant touted its clean energy accomplishments, noting it has purchased a volume of renewable power equal to its electricity use &#8212; meaning Amazon hit its 100% clean energy target seven years ahead of its goal. The report, released Wednesday, also said Amazon&#8217;s electric delivery fleet has reached 19,000 vehicles worldwide, with plans to increase that number five-fold by the end of the decade. It called out the addition of 77 new signatories to The Climate&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/amazons-carbon-footprint-shrinks-3-last-year-but-ai-driven-climate-challenges-loom/">Read More</a>
