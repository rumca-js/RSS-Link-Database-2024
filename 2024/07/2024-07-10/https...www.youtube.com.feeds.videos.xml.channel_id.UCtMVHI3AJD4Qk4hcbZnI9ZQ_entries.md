Hello guys and gals, it's me Mutahar again! This time we take a look at what appears to be an increase to Game Pass from one of the largest companies in the world. The streaming market has been inflating in the last couple years and specifically with Game Pass with day one releases being locked behind higher tiers it makes me wonder just how well the service is doing and if Microsoft could have potentially lied in their legal filings. Thanks for watching!
