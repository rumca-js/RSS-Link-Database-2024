<p><span>

I like making food at home, where I know my kitchen and ingredients.
I have a several things I </span>

<a href="https://www.jefftk.com/recipes/#often">make often</a>, and while
I sometimes make new things it's all a bit familiar.  So when I'm on a
vacation in a rental house, one thing I enjoy is cooking.  It's a bit
of a challenge, perhaps suitable for a low-stakes cooking show, but
it's fun to see what I can make with the constraints:


<p>

</p>

<ul>

<li><p>What pans are there?  Do they have any sneaky downsides?

</p></li>
<li><p>What non-perishable ingredients are left over from previous
visitors?

</p></li>
<li><p>What's the minimum I can buy at the store to combine with
what's already there and make something good?

</p></li>
<li><p>If we went to the store a few days ago and it's not worth going
again, what's a good fit for the collection of things we have left?

</p></li>
<li><p>What can I substitute for measuring cups?  How can I calibrate
them?
