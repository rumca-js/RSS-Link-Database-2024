Riot Games was reportedly developing a Smash Bros. style fighter set in the League of Legends universe, but pulled the plug on the project earlier this year after perceiving Warner Bros' Smash-inspired MultiVersus to have been a commercial failure.
</p><p>
That's according to former Washington Post video games and esports editor Mikhail Klimentov, who - writing in his <a href="https://www.readergrev.com/p/riot-games-pool-party-canceled-smash-melee">ReaderGrev newsletter</a> - claims 70-80 Riot employees were working on the Smash-inspired platform fighter, codenamed Pool Party.
</p><p>
Citing current and former Riot employees familiar with the  project, Klimnetov says Pool Party was initially envisaged as a hardcore fighting game but grew to incorporate party game elements and casual-friendly mechanics as development continued

Classic side-scrolling beat-'em-up Double Dragon is being reimagined in 3D by Arc System Works, the fighter-focused studio behind the likes of Dragon Ball FighterZ and Guilty Gear.
</p><p>
Double Dragon (for those needing a quick history refresher) first made a splash in arcades back in 1987, and has seen numerous sequels, spin-offs, and crossover releases - for both arcade and home systems - in the years since. Arc acquired the rights to the series in 2015, and would go on to release Double Dragon 4 in 2017, albeit to a fairly lukewarm reception.
</p><p>
While Double Dragon 4 and last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/double-dragon-gaiden-rise-of-the-dragons-out-this-summer">Secret Base-developed Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise Of The Dragons</a> both leaned heavily on the series' retro lineage, sporting a 2D pi

Mirage is the last of Apple's game announcements from the iPhone 15 event last September, and promises a fully-fledged version of what is a good-looking and technically accomplished AC title. That said, it comes with somewhat muted expectations given the inconsistent technical quality of those prior iPhone releases.

A new VR multiplayer game has been announced by nDreams, the developer of Synapse, coming to PSVR 2 and Meta Quest. 
</p><p>
Frenzies is an arena multiplayer shooter with gameplay similar to Synapse, split into unpredictable five-round matches with names like Red Light, Green Light and Glitter Pig - it's unclear exactly what that one's about.
</p><p>
Round types are both solo and team-based for an unpredictable experience (as the name suggests), all while wearing Squid Game-esque onesies with customisable masks.

Nintendo has posted an unusual and unexplained teaser video on its YouTube and social channels, for what appears to be a new horror project. 
</p><p>
The teaser features grainy footage of a figure in a trenchcoat wearing a paper bag on their head, with a smiling face drawn on it. 
</p><p>
Japanese text at the end of the video translates to "Smiling Man", while text accompanying the video simply states "#WhoIsEmio" - "Emio" being the Japanese pronounciation of "Smiling Man".

Sonic Team head Takashi Iizuka would love to make a Sonic RPG before he retires from Sega, though that's just a dream.
</p><p>
Iizuka was interviewed by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNeWQbiawnk">YouTube channel Good Vibes Gaming</a> for a preview of the forthcoming Sonic x Shadow Generations and discussed whether he'd ever work on a Sonic RPG in future.
</p><p>
"Personally, I really like role-playing games," he said. "The RPG game format is a lot of fun and I've even thought to myself 'you know, for the past 30 years we haven't done a Sonic RPG'. And I'm questioning myself. 'Why haven't we done a Sonic RPG in all this time? How have we gotten to 30 years with no RPGs?!'
