Individuals miffed at tax collection at source (TCS) proposals have now been offered a small relief - provided they have salary income. At present, a salaried employee may declare income, such as bank interest and rent, to their employer, who factors this and, accordingly, deducts a higher tax against the monthly salary. The employee then does not have to worry about paying advance tax as adequate tax has already been withheld.

Does this Budget leave you richer or poorer? The answer depends on your income level, which income tax regime you opt for, and how much and where you have invested.n For anybody with annual income of Rs 10 lakh or more, changes made by the FM in tax slabs under the new regime and the enhanced standard deduction mean a net gain of Rs 17,500 annually. Since a reduction in your tax also means health and education cess goes down, you save another Rs 700 (4% of Rs 17,500) to take the total savings to Rs 18,200.
