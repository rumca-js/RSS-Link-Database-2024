SURPRISE! We helped make a board game! Wilmot's Warehouse is a fabulous co-operative memory game from CMYK (Monikers, Wavelength, Daybreak), David King, and Hollow Ponds (Wilmot's Warehouse, I Am Dead, Flock) with a whole bunch of additional flavour and love by us!

DISCLOSURE: This is not a review. Shut Up & Sit Down contributed to the creation of this board game and benefit from every sale of the game. If you or your friend is a purchaser, thank you so much for your support!

In Wilmot’s Warehouse, your team will work cooperatively to organize the warehouse, using memory, imagination, and silly stories you make up.

DRAW product tiles off the stack, DISCUSS what they look like, and PLACE them somewhere youʼll remember!

After you place each tile, you flip it over and canʼt look at it again until the end of the game.
So your team has to remember where youʼve placed previous tiles as you decide where to place new on
