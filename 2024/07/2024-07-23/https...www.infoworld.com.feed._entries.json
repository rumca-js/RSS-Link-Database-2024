AI itself was old but is new again, and AI agents and agentic AI are another chapter. Agentic AI, known for its autonomous decision-making and complex goal management, radically transforms enterprise operations. The significant change is that public cloud providers are often not the desired platform of choice. Companies big and small are instead looking for smaller, more distributed platforms, including on-premises hardware servers and smaller devices.
