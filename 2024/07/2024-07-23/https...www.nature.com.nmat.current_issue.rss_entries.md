<p>Nature Materials, Published online: 23 July 2024; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41563-024-01955-4">doi:10.1038/s41563-024-01955-4</a></p>Propulsive motion in soft robotic systems requires the power amplification of stored energy. An accumulated strain energy-fracture power-amplification method is used to create light-driven soft robotic systems with a controlled launching ability.
