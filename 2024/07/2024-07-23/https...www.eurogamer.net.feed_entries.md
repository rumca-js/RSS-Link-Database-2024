Nintendo has formally revoked the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splatoon-3-review-a-lot-more-of-the-brilliant-same">Splatoon 3</a> World Championship 2024 winning team's title after racist messages sent by several of its members surfaced online.
</p><p>
This year's Splatoon 3 World Championship was held in April, with six teams competing for the crown. North American team Jackpot was eventually named the winner, but the four-person group became embroiled in controversy this June, after Discord and social media chats showing some of its members engaging in racist behaviour began <a href="https://x.com/adaptability_/status/1800558539934773269">circulating on social media</a>.
</p><p>
And now, roughly six weeks later, Nintendo has officially rescinded Jackpot's winning title, albeit without explicitly specifying the reason behind its

</p><p>
Humble Games was formed in 2017, and has gone on to publish a significant number of acclaimed titles, including Stray Gods, Signalis, Slay the Spire, A Hat in Time, and Eurogamer's Game of the Year in 2021, Unpacking.
</p><p>
Earlier today, however, several Humble Games employees took to social media with reports of layoffs at the company. "At 9AM this morning," business development manager Nicola Kwan <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7221563370863280128/">wrote</a> in a post on LinkedIn, "36 employees of Humble Games were told that we were being let go and t

Amid of swirl of rumours suggesting Microsoft was prepping more Call of Duty for an imminent Xbox Game Pass release, the company has confirmed last year's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 will join on its subscription service this Wednesday, 24th July.
</p><p>
As per Microsoft's <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/07/23/modern-warfare-3-coming-to-game-pass-july-24/">announcement</a>, Game Pass subscribers will have access to all Modern Warfare 3 modes, meaning its single-player campaign, multiplayer, and open-world Zombies.
</p><p>
Modern Warfare 3 is only the second <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/activision-blizzard">Activision Blizzard</a> title to hit Game Pass since Microsoft's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-has-finally-bought-activision-blizzard">$69bn acquisition of the company</a> last year, wi

Roblox's record on child safety has come under fire yet again, this time in a damning new <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/">Bloomberg</a> report that details the scale of the issue faced by the game's developers, who are unable to keep all of its young players safe. 
</p><p>
Last year, Roblox itself reported 13,316 instances of child exploitation to US authorities, and responded to over 1300 requests from authorities for detail on predatory players. 
</p><p>
In the last six years, at least two dozen people have been arrested in the US for abusing victims met via Roblox.

Cataclismo is the next game from Moonlighter developer Digital Sun and it's out now in early access.
</p><p>
The game was previously shown at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-everything-featured-in-todays-humble-games-showcase">2023's Humble Games showcase</a>, as well as the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-best-of-the-triple-i-showcase">Triple-i showcase</a> back in April to generate plenty of interest. It's also published by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/manor-lords">Manor Lords</a> publisher Hooded Horse.
</p><p>
Cataclismo is a twist on real-time strategy and tower defence, where players are tasked with building a fortress and defending it from endless hordes of demonic enemies, all with a unique moonlit art style.

Photos showing Lego's first wave of official Fortnite sets have popped up online, and feature a $99/&euro;120 (roughly &pound;76) Battle Bus set featuring an array of fan favourite characters as Lego minifigures.
</p><p>
Physical Fortnite Lego sets had been widely expected ever since the launch of last year's Lego Fortnite mode, which acts as the centrepiece of the two brands' deep integration. Fortnite now hosts an array of Lego minigames made both by fans and Lego itself, while almost every in-game character skin now has a digital minifigure version. 
</p><p>
Four Lego sets will reportedly arrive on 1st October this year, including the aforementioned Battle Bus, plus large models featuring a Supply Llama ($39/&euro;39, about &pound;30), the Durr Burger ($15/&euro;15, about &pound;12) and the Halloween-themed Peely Bone ($9

As players continue to struggle with the final boss of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Elden Ring DLC</a> Shadow of the Erdtree, one savvy <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a> streamer has destroyed the boss in just one hit.
</p><p>
To be honest, this was only a matter of time. While reactions to the DLC initially focused on its high difficulty - particularly the final boss - players have slowly found various methods of getting through the encounter. And this might be the most impressive (and convoluted) yet.

The development team behind <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> has apologised for elements in the game's marketing campaign so far that have jarred with some Japanese fans - and said the game will "keep evolving" as it heads towards launch in November. 
</p><p>
Ubisoft's statement, released via social media today in both English and Japanese, is fairly unspecific about what exactly it is apologising for - other than noting that "some elements in our promotional materials have caused concern within the Japanese community".

Reaction to yesterday's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elon-musks-tesla-cybertruck-will-be-available-to-buy-in-fortnite">reveal of the Tesla Cybertruck in Fortnite</a> has been swift from players and Epic Games' own developers alike. 
</p><p>
In a rare show of public disapproval, several Epic Games staff have taken to social media to give their personal takes on the addition of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/elon-musk">Elon Musk</a>'s car to the game.

Tiny pieces, quite often. When it comes to Nintendo World Championships, the unwieldy name is easily the lengthiest single thing about it. For the rest of the game, it's, what, 10 seconds, 50 at a push? This is Nintendo doing TikTok, Nintendo in the editing suite. And it's fascinating.</p><p>Nintendo World Championship is all about speedrunning. The game takes 13 old Nintendo classics and slices them down to form around 150 one-shot challenges. So Super Mario Bros, for example, has a challenge about getting a mushroom, a challenge about collecting all the coins in an underground section, a challenge about beating 1-1 as fast as you can. Ice Climber has challenges about reaching certain floors. The original

Amid its push toward mobile and free-to-play titles and away from the "volatile" AAA space, Warner Bros. has announced the acquisition of MultiVersus developer Player First Games.
</p><p>
MultiVersus - which has had an unusual, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/multiversus-to-shut-down-until-2024-with-no-refunds-for-paying-players">sometimes</a> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/multiversus-relaunch-comes-with-character-restrictions-and-people-arent-happy">controversial</a> development journey since the start of its open beta back in 2022 - is Player First Games' debut title.
