Deadpool & Wolverine reviewed by Tom Jorgensen. Opens in US theaters on Friday, July 26, 2024.

Deadpool & Wolverine is an outrageous, consistently funny superhero comedy that succeeds largely thanks to the contagious enthusiasm of leads Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman, and a surprisingly classy perspective on superhero movie history. Wade and Logan’s profanity-laced adventure forces the MCU farther out of its comfort zone than it’s been in years, even though old and increasingly frustrating issues like forgettable villains and a barely there plot show that breaking the fourth wall isn’t always enough to solve a movie’s foundational problems.

In today's Fix of entertainment news:

Marvel may have let some leaks from Deadpool and Wolverine slip...intentionally. Because it was fake news designed to throw us all off their scent. And Top Gun 3 could be coming a lot sooner than Top Gun: Maverick did, at least according to current Hollywood's leading 'it' man, Glen Powell.

On today's Fix of entertainment news:

Glenn Powell is on a roll. The standalone sequel to Twister is a certified hit, scoring well with critics and at the box office, with the third-biggest opening of the year. The movie touched down like a tornado, opening at number one in the U.S. box office, and is the second sequel of Powell's to hit number one—the first being 2022's Top Gun: Maverick. In other news, Marvel's Kevin Feige is adamant that the long-gestating Blade movie will be R-rated, but they don't want to rush it. But it has been five years since its announcement and they still don't have a script, so of course the fans are getting a little impatient.
