I tend to swing a bit but I've been needing social interaction and I love all things games - but since my co-op requires me to work at a desk I've been less interested in video games recently. </p> <p>There is no set game night so I'm mostly just trying to finagle something out of the blue. Things get cancelled about half the time. Yesterday my friends were eager to invite me over and play Arcs, a new game I got that I was wanting to try, and it was going well enough with some minor issues until the end of the game. </p> <p>Friend A's line to victory was preying on the weakest player.

I remember that when I bought it (5-10 years ago, it already was a hard find) but I hope to get help.</p> <p>It's a card game. There are cards numbered 1-8, first 5 are single in the deck, there are two copies of sixes and sevens, and three copies of eights and 2 or 3 copies of X's. X's are usually cards that do not have an active effect (you cannot play them), I clearly remember one of them being a 'Wound' - if you play 2 of them, you automatically lose. The setting is sci-fi but it's not clearly defined in the game, there's a small deck with something like 2 dozen cards, each card is unique having a special function. For example. you play it and you mix all players' hands and redistribute them. The goal of the game is to learn by the end of the game where one specific card (card #5 if I remember right) is.</p> <p>Here's the typical session: First, a number of cards (2 or 3, if I remember right) are pu

In the bottom right corner there were electrical purple vines. It was a dangerous area. That’s all I remember.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello everyone,</p> <p>I have long been looking for a game which is not properly a boardgame but rather a simulation game. The title is: &quot;Geography in an urban age&quot;. It was published by Macmillan, New York, ©1979 and authored by the Association of American Geographers (AAG). Basically it consists of several tasks and materials for five activities in the study of political geography for high school students. I am particularly interested in Unit 4 &quot;Point Roberts&quot; which simulates a border dispute between USA and Canada. I would like to get the classroom kit of this game, which includes role profile activity cards, 5 issues of newspaper (20 copies each), transparency with 4 overlays ; in portfolio, 26 x 31 x 5 cm. I know that some libraries in the USA have this material but they don't lend it abroad and I am based in Europe. I've already tried to contact both Macmillan and AAG but to no avail. Any suggestion is more than welcome. Thank

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Ok, I’m not sure I have a ton to go on here because most of what I remember is the advertising. So, when I was a kid I liked to try to design board games and this one broke my tiny heart because it was exactly like something I had been working on myself. I originally thought it was HeroQuest, but that was too early. This would have been maybe like 92 through 96 at the latest.</p> <p>So it’s a fantasy board game. It had TV commercials and was heavily advertised in comics, but I still can’t seem to figure it out. It used plastic figures on the board with your traditional classes and also hard cards for treasure and abilities/spells. I distinctly remember a kid in the commercial with some kind of line about fire like he was countering something. Am I from an alternate timeline maybe?</p> <p>I can tell you it’s not Dark World or TSR’s Dragon Strike because that’s what my searches mostly turned up and I owned those.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted

I've been thinking a lot lately about the weakness in larger 4X / civilization games, in that the only really model the Rise part, forever, and was wondering if there are other games that bite into this more deliberately? I know Oath is like this over the course of many games in a chronicle, and I assume that the Arcs campaign gesticulates in this direction (I haven't played campaign yet), but wanted to see if there were any games that include this sort of narrative arc more explicitly.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Lucretiel">

By strategically placing your game pawns in positions that block your opponents' progress, you can set back their ability to move forward and increase your chances of reaching the finish line first.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Has anyone every played this game an actually solved a case? My husband and I gave up after the first case. After leaving it on the shelf for years, we just picked it up again. We made it through two more cases before getting frustrated all over again. The mysteries do not seem logical. Sherlock does not really support his deductions. The story is full of holes. We even decided to throw the scoring out the window and just try to solve the case... and we still only gathered some of the story, even after engaging with as many locations as possible. I guess I'm hoping to hear that I'm not the only one who felt this way. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/DearHolyGhost"> /u/DearHolyGhost </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1e9x6bu/anyone_else_frustrated_by_sherlock_holmes/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1e9x6bu/any

## Novelty package design that works?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Is there any &quot;novelty&quot; package designs that you really enjoy? I would think ease of storage and stacking is a much higher priority for board game manufacturers, distributors, and consumers than a fun shape, but I'm curious to know of any opinions against that - or better yet, a design that does not sacrifice storage, but still has a novel shape of some kind. I know that certain low-complexity tabletop games (notably some card games or simple games like Yahtzee) have some novelty packaging. For sake of example: The Legend of Zelda Yahtzee and Donkey Kong Yahtzee have containers shaped as a chest and barrel, respectively. The Sneaky Snacky Squirrel Game has a tree shaped box (still flat like a box). I think there may be a few games shaped like a can or tuna container? Anyway, just curious if anyone has seen a novelty package design that you enjoy or that just works. Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www
