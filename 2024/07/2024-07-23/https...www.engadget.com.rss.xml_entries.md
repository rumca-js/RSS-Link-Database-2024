<p>Video games are supposed to provide us an escape from the grinding and anger produced on an average day.

The Cybertruck, Tesla’s electric vehicle that replaced the pink Hummer as the official car for total jerks, makes its digital debut in both games today.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/teslas-cybertruck-is-a-dystopian-masturbatory-fantasy-225648188.html">The Cybertruck</a> add-ons are part of a new “Summer Road Trip'' promotion bundle for <em>Fortnite </em>and <em>Rocket League</em>.

<p>You can's say Fujifilm is boring. It stuck to APS-C sensors instead of going full-frame like everyone else, while releasing cool and weird models like the X100 VI. That strategy has been refreshing in a conservative industry and <a href="https://wsau.com/2024/06/27/fujifilm-once-struggled-to-sell-cameras-now-it-cant-keep-up-with-demand/">undeniably successful</a>.</p>

<p>The first reports of instability issues with the 13th-gen Intel desktop CPUs started popping up in late 2022, mere months after the models came out. Those issues persisted, and over time, users reported dealing with unexpected and sudden crashes on PCs equipped with the company's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/intel-14th-gen-hx-cpu-launch-230005176.html">14th-gen CPUs</a>, as well. Now, Intel has <a href="https://community.intel.com/t5/Processors/July-2024-Update-on-Instability-Reports-on-Intel-Core-13th-and/m-p/1617113#M74792">announced</a> that it finally found the reason why its 13th and 14th-gen desktop processors have been causing crashes and giving out on users, and it promises to roll out a fix by next month.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In its announcement, Intel said that based on extensive analysis of the processors that had been returned to the company, it has determined that elevated operating voltage was causing the instability issues. Apparently, it's because a microcode algorithm

<p>Adobe has widely released a new and potentially contentious feature: text-to-image generation for Photoshop powered by Firefly, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/adobe-photoshops-latest-beta-makes-ai-generated-images-from-simple-text-prompts-090056096.html">first teased in April</a>. As with LLMs like Dall-E and Mid Journey, you can use it to create an image from scratch by typing a description into Photoshop's updated generative AI tool.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried it with the text &quot;Dramatic low angle view of a steamship from the 1800s in a storm with large waves and lightning&quot; in multiple styles (anime, watercolor, sketch, realistic) and got decent results. The usual AI art caveats apply though, particularly with weird details if you look closely. But it certainly created useable results and you have the benefit of already being inside Photoshop to fix any errors.&nbsp;</p>

That changes today as Amazon begins rolling out a new Prime Video UI that, in the company’s words, brings “clarity and simplicity back to streaming.”</p>
