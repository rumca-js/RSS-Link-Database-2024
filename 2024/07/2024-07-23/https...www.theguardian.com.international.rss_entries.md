<p>The documentary Join or Die examines the decline of organizations in America – and how it’s fueled a national crisis</p><p>Between the 1970s and 1990s, the number of Americans who attended a single local civic meeting in a year plummeted by 40%. The number who went to a single meeting of a club – say, the Rotary or a local tennis team – dropped by 50%. Even the number of picnics Americans joined dropped by 60%. And as the social scientist Robert Putnam has been telling us for decades, this matters – in fact, it may be a question of life or death.</p><p>That’s because, as Putnam has told audiences, “your chances of dying over the next year are cut in half by joining one group.” And it’s not just a matter of our own health – it’s about the health of democracy itself.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/article/2024/jul/23/join-or-die-documentary-review">Continue reading...</a>
