It's received extensive support through the years, including console ports, but Unite is perhaps its biggest yet and a pseudo-rebrand of sorts.\n\nFeaturing improved visuals, a new track in Singapore, overhauled multiplayer modes, a new PvP mode called Team Pursuit and crossplay, Unite purportedly offers a lot for long-time fans. Unfortunately, the matchmaking in its \"ranked\" modes is subpar, while Team Pursuit is a poor imitation of Hot Pursuit from the NFS series.\n\nCoupled with annoying progression systems, egregious monetization, horrendous rubberbanding and a repetitive Career Mode, Asphalt Legends Unite feels like a drag. Its arcade gameplay and visuals may prove enticing - plus it's free-to-play. However, the real meat of the experience is incredibly lacking when it's not actively trying to aggravate you.", "id": 917788, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ6goQ2uQ8Q", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "source_obj__id": 129, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/NZ6goQ2uQ8Q/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Asphalt Legends Unite Review - The Final Verdict", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-07-23T17:30:06+00:00", "description": "We\u2019re into the latter half of 2024 and rumours behind one of the gaming industry\u2019s worst kept secrets is gathering momentum once again.

To be clear, there is nothing concrete confirming or denying PS5 Pro\u2019s November release window, but as this feature describes there are a handful of concerns that November might come too soon for this expected powerhouse of a mid-generation refresh. \n\nWe\u2019ll just have to wait and see \u2013 the PS4 Pro was announced in the September prior to its November 2016 release after all.\n\nThumbnail credit: Wccftech", "id": 916048, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMFZau13tJk", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "source_obj__id": 129, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/tMFZau13tJk/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "PS5 PRO - Where The Hell Is It?", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-07-23T10:45:00+00:00", "description": "On the surface, Star Wars Outlaws is a dream come true for franchise fans.
