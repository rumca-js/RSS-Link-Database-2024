This video introduces the MIT Climate Primer, an open online interactive space to explore climate science, climate change, risks and solutions. Through 11 short digital “chapters,” this Webby Award–winning website leads you through the story of how scientists came to realize that human actions are changing the Earth’s climate, as well as the open questions that scientists are still working to answer. Along the way, you can interact with graphics, quizzes, narration, videos and additional resources to go deeper on the topics you are most curious about.
