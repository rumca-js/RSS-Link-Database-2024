This led Amazon to continue investing heavily in its devices business despite losing more than $25 billion on the division between 2017 and 2021. That&#8217;s according to a report by the Wall Street Journal overnight, which cites internal documents and sources in a deep dive on Amazon&#8217;s devices business by reporter Dana Mattioli, author of a recent book about the company. The WSJ reports that Amazon will be launching a paid tier for Alexa as soon as this month, despite&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/report-details-financial-pressure-on-amazon-alexa-confirms-plans-for-paid-tier-and-ai-revamp/">Read More</a>

That thought struck me this weekend as I was reading through a collection of old Microsoft emails and documents featuring the likes of Steve Ballmer, Steven Sinofsky, and other former executives with the Redmond company. The internal messages offer a glimpse into Microsoft&#8217;s decisions surrounding the 2006-2007 Windows Vista launch (and the resulting fallout), with enough underlying management lessons to fill a business book. How did I fall into this rabbit hole? Part of the blame goes to the Acquired podcast&#8216;s epic series on Microsoft&#8217;s history.
