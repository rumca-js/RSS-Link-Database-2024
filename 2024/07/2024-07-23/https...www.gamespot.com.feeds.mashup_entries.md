<p dir="ltr">As Deadpool jokes several different times over the course of Deadpool &amp; Wolverine, the Marvel Cinematic Universe is experiencing "a bit of a low point" since the massive success of Avengers: Endgame. Fortunately, Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds) is here to shake things up by joining the MCU and making things weird, right? Maybe not, because Deadpool &amp; Wolverine is just an R-rated version of a bog-standard modern Marvel flick: It's pretty funny, the story centers around the same CGI macguffin stuff as always, the third act is utterly baffling and feels like a bunch of stuff was cut, and there are ultimately no meaningful plot connections to the MCU. Standard stuff for the last five years of this franchise, and a major disappointment for the only MCU movie on the 2024 calendar.</p><p dir="ltr">Not that Deadpool &amp; Wolverine is awful. It's got several great bloody action sequences, including an opening bloodbath set to NSync's "Bye Bye Bye," and when it's funny, it's real

<p>This month, Peacock hiked up the rates for its upper tiers ahead of this week's Olympic games in Paris. Apparently, half a million Peacock subscribers didn't wait around for those price increases to go into effect. According to the Comcast's shareholder report for its second quarter of 2024, Peacock shed 500,000 paying subscribers between April and June.</p><p>Via <a href="https://variety.com/2024/streaming/news/peacock-subscribers-down-33-million-q2-1236081282/">Variety</a>, Comcast admitted that it slightly fudged the numbers of its 2024 first quarter results that claimed Peacock had 34 million subscribers. The real number was 33.5 million subscribers, because Comcast rounded up from there. Now, following the latest losses, Peacock has approximately 33 million paid subscribers.</p><p>Comcast has yet to make a profit from Peacock, and the report notes that the streamer lost $348 million during the second quarter.

<p>Independent game developer Play by Play Studios has announced its formation and revealed its first project, which is a character-driven 3v3 basketball game that celebrates the sport and its culture.</p><p>The Run: Got Next is the name of the game, and it aims to be easy to pick up and play, but also deep enough for people looking for a challenge. The full-court 3v3 game bends the rules of real basketball "in the name of fun," but is not a full-on arcade-style basketball game. Take a look for yourself in the trailer below.</p><div>          </div><p>Players assemble a roster of players, each with their unique move-sets, with the aim of building a winning streak and holding court. The game has different courts to play on, and each favors a different type of playstyle. There is also an in-game shop featuring items, abilities, sponsors, and shoes that players can acquire, though whether or not this is a real-money shop is unknown.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stylish-l

<p>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine isn't a "commercial for another movie," according to actor Ryan Reynolds. It's a standalone film, he said recently on Good Morning America. That's notable because many Marvel movies tell interconnected stories, with one film ending with a teaser for the next. Deadpool &amp; Wolverine, though, will tell its own self-contained story, apparently.</p><p>"We recognized this was lighting in a bottle; it's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. And also, we didn't do a movie that is necessarily a commercial for another movie. It is a complete experience when you come to see Deadpool &amp; Wolverine," Reynolds said.</p><p>Reynolds went on to say that Disney gave him their "full support" to make Deadpool &amp; Wolverine its own thing as opposed to being a part of a bigger MCU puzzle.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/deadpool-wolverine-is-not-a-commercial-for-another-movie-ryan-reynolds-says/1100-6525222/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

And although the squad-based shooter is good--I think it might even have the capacity to be great--it doesn't seem to deliver what's advertised on the tin. At its core, Ascendant.com feels like a solid shooter with an engaging capture-the-flag gameplay loop, but the various in-match events I experienced didn't impact the flow of the game to the extent that I needed to change up my strategy between games.

There have been a lot of rumblings about who would be in this film, and it turns out that a good number of those rumors were planted by Marvel itself in an attempt to preserve Deadpool and Wolverine's surprises.</p><p>"There may or may not have been some subterfuge and [misdirection] on the internet or in-person in order to protect the secrecy," explained executive producer Wendy Jacobson during an interview with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/superhero-movies/marvel-leaks-deadpool-and-wolverine-cameos-executive-producer-wendy-jacobson-interview/">GamesRadar</a>.

<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lady-deadpool-and-the-deadpool-corps-arrive-in-new-deadpool-and-wolverine-trailer/1100-6525009/">Deadpool and Wolverine</a> was finally screened for critics across the country, and now the first reactions have come online via social media. Marvel movies, and comic book films in general, tend to be well-received in early screenings by fans of the genre... unless of course the projects in question are spectacularly misfires. Fortunately, the vast majority of the responses to Deadpool and Wolverine are effusive with praise for the film. Even The Tonight Show host Jimmy Fallon couldn't resist weighing in on it.</p><div><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">Congrats to all of the amazing minds that came together to make <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DeadpoolAndWolverine?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc^tfw">#DeadpoolAndWolverine</a>.

<p>It's been five years since DC's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/joker-review-the-dark-antihero-origin-story-that-c/1900-6417285/">Joker</a> film swept the box office and became the highest-grossing rated-R movie of all time and even had Joaquin Phoenix take home the Best Actor at the Academy Awards. Now Arthur Fleck, this universe's Joker, is a high-profile resident of Arkham Asylum and comes across therapist Harleen Quinzel (Lady Gaga). We got our first look at the feature back in April, but we go all out with the bad romance here.</p><p>The trailer shows a musical mayhem murder tour as the couple falls in love and experiences shared delusions. Harleen slowly loses her own grip on reality and becomes the Joker's lover and accomplice. Since his murder of talk show host Murray Franklin, Fleck/Joker has been put on a pillar by those who consider themselves disenfranchised, with some of the movie centering around his trial. Check it out below.</p><div>          </div><p>Dire
