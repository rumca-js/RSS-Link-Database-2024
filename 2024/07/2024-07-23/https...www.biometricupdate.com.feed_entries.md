		Governments in Australia and Nigeria are working on digital birth registration to make it easier for parents to qualify their children for government services and enroll them in school. Australia is changing the agency responsible for its digital birth certificate program, and Nigeria is getting help from UNICEF.

The Australian government has announced changes to its digital birth certificate program and “life event” services. In a move aimed at streamlining efforts and improving efficiency, the Digital Transformation Agency (DTA) has been stripped of its responsibilities for “life event” services, including the development and implementation of digital birth certificates, which have shifted to Services Australia, <a href="https://www.innovationaus.com/dta-stri

		Through the use of generative AI and open-source tools, hackers are gaining the ability to easily create deepfakes and voice clones, allowing them to mimic the appearance and voice of another person. The complexity of carrying out such fraudulent activities has significantly decreased, leading to a reduction in the cost and expertise required, as explained in a report offering <a href="https://www.idrnd.ai/a-developers-guide-against-video-injection-attacks/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">guidance to developers</a> on video injection attacks from <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/id-rd">ID R&amp;D</a>.

While creating deepfake viral videos for social media is relatively straightforward from an attacker's perspective, real-time video injection at

		Smartphones play a central role in remote identity verification (IDV), enabling a host of advanced functionalities that compliment biometrics, including document authentication and liveness detection. The companies behind these functionalities are emphasizing the importance of these layered technologies to providing secure remote IDV.

Malaysia-based IDV provider <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/innov8tif">Innov8tif Solutions</a> has been granted a <a href="https://ppubs.uspto.gov/dirsearch-public/print/downloadPdf/12026932" rel="noopener" target="_blank">United States patent</a> for its authentication technology for identification documents via smartphones.

		Students from universities across Eastern Africa have been invited to submit ideas in the first of a series of planned hackathons intended to identify and test new digital ID use cases for eventual real-world deployment.

The hackathon is organized by <a href="https://www.africa.engineering.cmu.edu/research/upanzi/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Upanzi Network</a> at the Carnegie Mellon University in Rwanda, and <a href="https://www.microsave.net/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">MicroSave Consulting</a> (MSC), a collaborative partnership of research engineering labs and a global consulting firm that has worked with governments for the past 25 years.

		Some civil society organizations in Kenya say they want an explanation from the government with regard to the institution of an expiry date for the new generation national digital ID cards.

Representatives of these organizations were speaking in a recent press conference in Nairobi, and also claimed the move is possibly part of a ploy by the Ruto administration to rig elections, given that ID cards are a requirement for voting, according to <a href="https://www.kenyans.co.ke/news/102984-civil-society-raises-concerns-over-expiry-new-digital-id-cards">Kenyans</a>.

The Maisha ID cards have a ten-year validity period, a major shift from the previous generation of ID cards in Kenya which had no expiry date.

		Even when a facial recognition system is integrated within a state or federal investigative agency, human intervention is necessary. In cases involving 1:N identification, the process involves facial recognition by a software system followed by facial comparison by a human operator.

The top two <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202309/idemia-asserts-top-results-for-biometric-performance-across-modalities-in-nist-tests">algorithms</a> recognized by NIST for facial review for investigative and operational leads cover mugshot images in a database of 12 million individuals with a high accuracy of 99.88 percent. However, in most forensic cases, the images gathered have low quality, necessitating the involvement of humans in adjudicating the facial recognition results.

		The hour is ripe for political deepfakes. The U.S. presidential elections are still four months away, and the campaign has already seen a controversial attempted political assassination of one candidate and the withdrawal of another in response to concerns about mental acuity. The basic realities of the normal American electoral process have been shredded – and, according to new research from <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/jumio">Jumio</a>, many voters see biometric deepfakes lurking in the fissures.

A release from Jumio says its <a href="https://www.jumio.com/2024-identity-study/">2024 Online Identity Study</a> reveals a deep unease among U.S. adults about the potential for AI deepfakes to influence the upcoming elections. Among some 2,000 Ameri

		The already controversial American Privacy Rights Act of 2024 (APRA), which was originally introduced in April by U.S. Senate Commerce Committee Chair, Sen. Maria Cantwell, and House Energy and Commerce Committee Chair, Rep. Cathy Rodgers, was reintroduced by Rodgers in the House on June 25 as <a href="https://www.congress.gov/118/bills/hr8818/BILLS-118hr8818ih.pdf">H.R. 8818</a>, and both expands and compromises on the comprehensive federal consumer privacy framework that was outlined in the first draft of the legislation.

Significant are the special requirements for biometric and genetic data, which are further refined. Collecting such data would now require express consent, without exception.

		A request for the Expression of Interest (EOI) has been launched for a consultancy firm to identify challenges that stand in the way of civil status registration in the Republic of Chad.

Interested candidates are expected to submit their EOI by July 29 at the latest, according to the <a href="https://wbgeprocure-rfxnow.worldbank.org/rfxnow/public/advertisement/3397/view.html">advertisement details</a>. The World Bank is funding the project.

Once that has been done, candidates adjudged as qualified for the procurement will be shortlisted for the submission of bid proposals. Submissions should be done only in English through electronic mail, the project owners say.
