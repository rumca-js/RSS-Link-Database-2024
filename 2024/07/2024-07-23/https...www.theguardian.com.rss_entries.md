Every time she showed up, it was like a cartoon started playing in the middle of the otherwise meticulously assembled, plotted and played legal drama. It never failed to make me want to put a fist through the screen. Yet she became a fan favourite, and so a spinoff became inevitable.</p><p>Now it is here. It is called Elsbeth.

Well, that’s not strictly true. It <em>does</em> end – <em>after 71 minutes</em> – it’s just that I’ve never watched that far.

<p>Pre-season will see some unfamiliar starting lineups as Pep Guardiola wrangles with a host of absent first-team regulars</p><p>The starting point for this summer sojourn to the US is to review the group available to Pep Guardiola to face Celtic, Milan, Barcelona and Chelsea because it shapes the planning. The major international tournament participants Kevin De Bruyne, Bernardo Silva, Rúben Dias, Matheus Nunes, Jérémy Doku, Nathan Aké, Manuel Akanji, Phil Foden, Rodri, John Stones, Kyle Walker and Julián Álvarez are absent, and the Croatian duo Mateo Kovacic and Josko Gvardiol will join up partway through.

<p>IOC has sold UK broadcasting rights for Games to Discovery leaving BBC with fewer streams to show live action</p><p>At Tokyo 2020 there was dismay among UK Olympics lovers when the BBC provided a much more restricted offering than in London 2012 and Rio 2016 after the rights to the Olympics were sold to a US pay-TV company. These days, Warner Bros Discovery holds the main Olympics rights in the UK, with the BBC sub-licencing from the broadcaster.</p><p>At Paris 2024 the howls may be even louder because of the friendlier timezone, and people’s desire to watch their preferred events as they unfold throughout the day.

But in the 15 years since it was published, we’ve been invited to give well over 1,000 lectures and conferences to tell people about our research. Our findings were clear then and are still true now. When economic inequality gets worse, so does our health and wellbeing. Inequality can affect a society’s death rates, its levels of chronic disease, and the amount of violence (including murders) it experiences. What we weren’t prepared for when we first wrote the book was how much worse things could get.</p><p>Today, inequality seeps into almost every facet of life. Children in the most unequal societies

<p>The San Francisco poet’s work is richly illuminated by this detailed account of his early traumas, dread of ‘deep emotion’ and addiction to casual sex</p><p>One morning in Hampstead in 1944, Thom Gunn, aged 15, came downstairs to find his dead mother slumped on the kitchen floor in front of the oven, having gassed herself. Her husband had deserted her, as had her current lover; a note she left for her two young sons addressed them as “my darlings” and told them to fetch the charlady. “I was made to feel too much for my age,” Gunn later complained when remembering that day, and he was left with a lifelong dread of “deep emotion”. When in 1991 he finally wrote a poem about the trauma, he took care, as he said, “to objectify the situation”. He described it as if it had happened to someone else, and despite the need to find a rhyme for “other”, he refused to use the painful, accusatory word “mother”.</p><p>As Michael Nott points out in his fine, frank biography, Gunn’s writing develope

 Giving The Good Wife’s disarmingly daffy lawyer Elsbeth Tascioni (Carrie Preston) her own Columbo-esque “howcatchem”, transplanted from Chicago to New York, is such a no-brainer that you wonder why this spin-off has taken so long. Even better, The Wire’s Wendell Pierce also features, as Captain Wagner, her boss at the NYPD, who recognises that this scatterbrained sleuth may just be on to something. In the first episode, she investigates a&nbsp;suspicious apparent suicide. <strong>Ellen E Jones</strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/article/2024/jul/23/tv-tonight-the-good-wifes-elsbeth-tascioni-gets-the-spin-off-detective-show-she-deserves">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In 1972, while travelling the world, the Robertsons’ boat was attacked by whales. They found themselves adrift for weeks on a tiny raft, forced to drink turtle blood, kill sharks and use enemas to stay hydrated, while fighting for their lives</p><p>It was 10am on a choppy morning at sea when 18-year-old Douglas Robertson heard a bang. Then another. And another. Their 13-metre (43ft) wooden schooner Lucette had been lifted out of the sea. “I thought: What the hell was that? We must have gone aground.” He looked at his father and discovered he was ankle-deep in water. Then he looked over his shoulder to the vastness of the Pacific. “There were three orcas; a daddy, mummy and a baby in between. The daddy’s head was split open and bleeding badly.”</p><p>He turned back to his father, who was now knee-deep in water. It was only then that it dawned on him what had happened. The whales had attacked the schooner. “Dougal said: ‘Abandon ship, we’re sinking!’” Douglas, who had a complex relat

My&nbsp;stepfather, my uncle – literally all of them were hardcore Nazis during the second world war. And after? Not a single one changed their convictions or voiced any regrets for the Nazi crimes. On the contrary, they denied or justified them, including the Holocaust and mass murder committed with their knowledge and, worst of all, sometimes their active participation. We were not exceptional – in Austria and Germany, there were many families like ours.</p><p>The official postwar version of events stated that Austria had been the first victim of Hitler’s expansionist politics.
