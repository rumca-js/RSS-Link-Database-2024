He wants to release imports of the sector in Health, whereas minister Russo objects to it. In Labour, in turn, he intends for the Casa Rosada to crack down on the CGT General Workers’ Confederation, while secretary Cordero has been opening dialogues with the union. In the area of Education, he is working on an education reform without secretary Torrendell. In Economy he is in synch, though at Casa Rosada they believe there will be a tense calm provided there is no macroeconomic turbulence. <a href="https://www.batimes.com.ar/news/opinion-and-analysis/unstoppable-sturzenegger-his-arrival-in-the-cabinet-triggers-new-libertarian-conflicts.phtml">Leer más</a>

The Unitary Platform — whose Edmundo González is running against President Nicolás Maduro — says it has organized enough volunteers to help observe the count at the country’s roughly 30,000 polling tables on July 28. <a href="https://www.batimes.com.ar/news/latin-america/venezuela-opposition-relies-on-citizens-to-protect-july-28-votes.phtml">Leer más</a>

<p><img alt="MILEI APPLE" src="https://fotos.perfil.com/2024/07/23/trim/540/304/milei-apple-1840815.jpg" /></p>Milei has two economic jobs: lowering inflation and getting the economy going. So far, he is halfway through the first goal and nowhere with the second. All eyes are on Economy Minister Luis Caputo, whose job will be on the line if this latest scheme fails. <a href="https://www.batimes.com.ar/news/opinion-and-analysis/mileis-useless-fight-against-gravity.phtml">Leer más</a>

<p><img alt="PICASSO" src="https://fotos.perfil.com/2024/07/23/trim/540/304/picasso-1840800.jpg" /></p>The Milei administration is stuck between a rock and a hard place.
