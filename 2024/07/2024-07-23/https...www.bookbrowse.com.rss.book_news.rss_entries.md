The prestigious&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/hugoaward">Hugo awards</a>&nbsp;for science fiction and fantasy writing has revealed that almost 400 votes &#8211; about 10% of all votes cast in this year's awards &#8211; were fraudulently paid for to help one finalist win.

  The Hugo administration subcommittee, which tallies the votes for the annual awards,&nbsp;<a href="https://glasgow2024.org/hugo-awards/statement-22-july-2024/">issued a statement on Monday</a>&nbsp;saying that they had determined that 377 votes had been cast by individuals with "obvious fake names and/or other disqualifying characteristics".

The law enforcement officer spent months methodically gathering evidence. He leafed through thousands of pages and highlighted key passages amid reams and reams of paper. He wore his body camera to record his interactions with witnesses and suspects. And he photographed what he saw as instruments of the alleged crime: Books.&nbsp;
  <br /><br />
  The targets of the investigation? Three school librarians in Granbury, Texas. The allegation? They had allowed children to access literature &#8212; such as "The Bluest Eye," by Toni Morrison &#8212; that the officer, Scott London, a chief deputy constable, had deemed obscene.
