Augmented reality is on its way. The ability to layer media over top of the real world is, for the moment, a hardware problem. Our phones can do it &#8211; think Pokémon Go, or Snapchat’s dancing hotdog &#8211; but a real-time heads-up display remains out of reach, for the moment. When such technology arrives, it [&#8230;]

It sounds absolutely batty that there is a strong, bipartisan push to lock up aspects of our law behind copyright. But it’s happening. Even worse, the push is on to include this effort to lock up the law in the “must pass” National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). This is the bill that Congress lights up [&#8230;]

Good news for phone owners. Perhaps a little less great for law enforcement, which presumably still doesn&#8217;t have the capability to crack the latest cell phones. Not that it&#8217;s all bad news for law enforcement. Whether or not compelled password production is a constitutional violation is still an open question. Those whose phones are secured [&#8230;]

In a stunning display of technocratic incompetence, the EU&#8217;s Digital Services Act (DSA) has effectively outlawed the very tool that online platforms have relied on for years to combat trolls: shadowbanning. Recent court decisions suggest that the DSA&#8217;s (possibly?) well-intentioned but misguided Article 17 has created a troll&#8217;s paradise, leaving websites in an impossible position [&#8230;]

The leading candidate to head the FCC should Trump win re-election is facing calls for an investigation into Hatch Act violations after he helped co-author the controversial Project 2025. Sixteen House Democrats have sent a letter to government officials arguing that Carr&#8217;s involvement in the openly political Project 2025 is a clear violation of the [&#8230;]

Here&#8217;s a fun one, coming to us via MLive, which at least let us know this exists, even if it couldn&#8217;t be bothered to post the freely available decision posted at the Michigan Supreme Court&#8217;s website. I can only imagine the amount of cop whining this will provoke. When cops don&#8217;t have a legitimate reason [&#8230;]
