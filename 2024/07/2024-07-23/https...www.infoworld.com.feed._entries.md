<p>AI agents are nothing new. AI itself was old but is new again, and AI agents and agentic AI are another chapter. Agentic AI, known for its autonomous decision-making and complex goal management, radically transforms enterprise operations. The significant change is that public cloud providers are often not the desired platform of choice. Companies big and small are instead looking for smaller, more distributed platforms, including on-premises hardware servers and smaller devices. Let’s explore the driving forces behind this transition and its future implications for enterprise AI.</p>

<p>Java applications evaluate expressions in the context of <em>statements</em>, which are used for tasks such as declaring a variable, making a decision, or iterating over statements. We can write either simple or compound statements:</p>

<ul>
<li>A <strong>simple statement</strong> is a single standalone instruction for performing a task; it must be terminated with a semicolon character (<code>;</code>).</li>

<li>A <strong>compound statement</strong> is a sequence of simple and other compound statements located between open- and close-brace characters (<code>{...}</code>), which delimit the compound statement’s boundaries. Compound statements can be empty, will appear wherever simple statements

However, these models come with their own set of challenges, such as generating content that may not be accurate (hallucination), relying on stale knowledge, and employing opaquely intricate reasoning paths that are often not traceable. </p>
