He wants to release imports of the sector in Health, whereas minister Russo objects to it. In Labour, in turn, he intends for the Casa Rosada to crack down on the CGT General Workers\u2019 Confederation, while secretary Cordero has been opening dialogues with the union. In the area of Education, he is working on an education reform without secretary Torrendell. In Economy he is in synch, though at Casa Rosada they believe there will be a tense calm provided there is no macroeconomic turbulence. <a
