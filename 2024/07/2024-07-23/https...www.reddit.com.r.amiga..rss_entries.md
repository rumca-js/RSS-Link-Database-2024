<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Were there any magazines that were primarily targeted to Amiga programming audience? Like for example what Dr Dobbs Journal was for the PC, or Compute magazine for the 8-bits. </p> <p>You know, those kinds mags we used to find extremely boring back then, but find somewhat useful and more interesting today, LOL. I guess everyone reaches that age when they read the mags for articles, heh.</p> <p>I couldn't hold my attention to read a single article in the Byte magazine as a kid, but absolutely love to read them today. It's like a curated time travel excursion into the digital 80s and 90s...</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Albedo101"> /u/Albedo101 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1eajtua/any_magazines_dedicated_to_amiga_programming_scene/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1eajtua/any_magazines_dedicated_to_amiga_programmi

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>After buying a CD32 with a Terrible Fire 330 on eBay I found my TV doesn’t have RGB input (that was on my old one, doh!). I’ve looked at Amiga RGB to Scart cables but there are loads to choose from, some cheap, some not so cheap and some expensive. Also, a lot of the ones I’ve looked at say they don’t work on the CD32, I haven’t found one that says it is compatible. I also understand I need something to convert RGB to HDMI. I’ve looked at a OSSC and they are about $130. I don’t mind paying that price but again there are loads of them to choose from.</p> <p>Could anyone recommend a RGB cable and something to covert the signal, OSCC or other? I’m based in the UK so suggestions have to work with UK power supply. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/NeilDeWheel"> /u/NeilDeWheel </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1eabayz/connecting_cd32_to_hdmi/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <spa

## Problem with external gotek and internal floppy

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi! I just got an Amiga 500, a Gotek, a boot selector and this adapter: <a href="https://amigastore.eu/en/440-amiga-external-floppy-disk-drive-adapter-m1.html">https://amigastore.eu/en/440-amiga-external-floppy-disk-drive-adapter-m1.html</a> .</p> <p>After quite some troubleshooting I got it to work mostly. The previous owner had shorted out the 5v pin on the floppy port, burning the trace off the PCB of my poor Amiga. I was able to fix this by soldering a thin wire in to replace the burnt trace. There might be something else broken too in the hardware, but I'm not sure. I did check the traces next to it with my multimeter and they are fine.</p> <p>The problem that remains is that I can only use the external Gotek when there is a floppy in the internal drive. So for some reason the disk change signal from the external Gotek doesn't work. What is weird however, is if I disconnect the internal drive, it works just fine. I did swap around the CIA chips,
