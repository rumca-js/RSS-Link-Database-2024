  <p id="l09AdD">Google made nearly $85 million over the past few months as revenue from its Search and cloud computing businesses soared. That’s according to the quarter two earnings report released by <a href="https://abc.xyz/assets/19/e4/3dc1d4d6439c81206370167db1bd/2024q2-alphabet-earnings-release.pdf">Google's parent company, Alphabet</a>, on Tuesday, which says Search alone raked in $48.5 million.</p>

  <p id="MDJToO">Tesla published its <a href="https://ir.tesla.com/#quarterly-disclosure">second quarter earnings report</a>, in which the company said it earned $1.48 billion in net income on $25.5 billion in revenue. That represents a 2 percent increase year over year compared to $24.9 billion in revenue in Q2 2023 but a 45 percent drop in net income.</p>
<p id="hfjdls">Tesla’s gross margins were in the spotlight again, as bullish investors hoped to see improvements after years of steady decline. Rampant price cutting and cooling demand as well as cheaper financing have pushed the company’s once-vaunted margins to their lowest point in six years. </p>
