Nearly 40 million adults in the U.S. have sleep apnea, and more than 30 million of them use a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine while sleeping. However, the machines tend to be expensive, clunky and uncomfortable -- resulting in many users giving up on using them. High blood pressure is often linked with sleep apnea because the brain works harder to regulate blood flow and breathing during sleep. A recent study offers new insight into the underlying mechanisms within the brain contributing to hypertension for those with sleep apnea.

A stroke not only causes acute damage to the brain, but can also have long-term health implications for other organs -- such as the heart. Researchers have worked on the hypothesis that the high rate of comorbidities that develop after a stroke could have a common immunological cause. And they actually managed to find it: The origin of the dysfunctions in other parts of the body lies in the immunological memory of the blood-forming cells in bone marrow.
