<p>In this case study, Deryck Webb from the Government of Alberta (GoA) explains how Microsoft Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD) and Nerdio enabled employees to access workspaces from anywhere across the most remote parts of Canada — particularly vital for those involved in critical services, such as wildfire management.</p>



<p>Originally relying on on-premises Citrix and VMware solutions, GoA found Azure Virtual Desktop to be a more robust, cost-effective alternative as part of its Microsoft 365 licensing. By partnering with Nerdio, GoA was able to streamline its Azure Virtual Desktop deployment, providing seamless access and improved user experience for over 3,000 monthly active users.</p>

<p>With the evolution of the cloud, cloud services are becoming broadly accessible and are a more viable option to deliver virtual desktops from the cloud. However, many organizations also struggle with the transition to the cloud due to the new skills required and a different approach to infrastructure and operations. Nerdio changes the game by simplifying and enabling efficient and effective operational tooling through automated deployment and configuration features, streamlined setup, and cost-effective running of cloud environments.</p>

<p>Finance ministers from the G20 countries are meeting this week in Rio de Janeiro to discuss, among other things, whether a global tax on digital services should be introduced.</p>



<p>Eight of the countries — France, India, Italy, Canada, Spain, Great Britain, Turkey and Austria — have chosen to introduce taxes on their own that primarily affect American technology companies such as Amazon, Apple, and Google.</p>



<p>The US, for its part, has threatened to respond by imposing tariffs on everything from French champagne to Italian handbags, according to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/digital-tax-talks-g20-spotlight-us-tariff-threat-looms-2024-07-23/" rel="noreferrer noopener" tar

<p>In what it called its biggest product update since the company’s founding in 2011, Miro has launched Intelligent Canvas, an AI-driven platform designed to help teams manage their entire innovation lifecycle.</p>



<p>“In many cases, the tools designed to make us faster are actually slowing us down,” Jeff Chow, chief product and technology officer at Miro, said in a July 17 <a href="https://miro.com/blog/introducing-intelligent-canvas/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">blog introducing the platform</a>. “We blow all our energy figuring out <em>how</em> to work or <em>where</em> to work instead of actually doing work. Teams can’t get on the same page and decision-making is disconnected.

<p>During the last two years of the Great Depression, Westinghouse built a robot. </p>



<p>One of several famous “mechanical men” built in that era, the company’s Elektro robot was created to showcase Westinghouse’s electrical engineering prowess at the 1939 New York World’s Fair.</p>



<p>Elektro amazed crowds. Standing seven feet tall and weighing 265 pounds, the humanoid robot could walk, talk, blow up balloons, move his head and arms, and even smoke cigarettes. His photoelectric “eyes” could distinguish red and green light.</p>



<p>Elektro could speak about 700 words using a 78 rpm record player installed in its torso. The words were delivered by a series of turntables connected to relay s

<p>Microsoft has been struggling to get people to use its Edge browser for years. Even though the company made Edge the default browser in Windows 10, users left in droves, most of them flocking to Google Chrome — and with good reason. The original version of Edge was underpowered, had difficult-to-use features, and offered very few extensions compared to Chrome and Firefox.</p>



<p>But in January 2020, Microsoft launched <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/1671015/microsofts-new-edge-browser-third-times-the-charm.html">a new version of Edge</a> that’s based on the same technologies that drive Chrome.
