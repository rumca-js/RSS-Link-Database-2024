		A school in Chelmsford, Essex, has been reprimanded by the Information Commissioner's Office (<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/information-commissioners-office-ico">ICO</a>) for the unlawful implementation of facial recognition technology (FRT) in its canteen.

Chelmer Valley High School, which serves 1,200 students aged 11-18, began using FRT in March 2023 to facilitate cashless payments. However, the use of FRT, which processes biometric data for individual identification, carries data protection risks, and is regulated by the ICO. Organizations deploying such technology are required by law to conduct a data protection impact assessment (DPIA) to manage these risks.

Chelmer Valley High School failed to perform a DPIA before implementing FRT, neglecting to asses

		<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/tech5">Tech5</a> has developed biometric template protection technology that it says meets the criteria set out in the <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/53256.html">ISO/IEC 30136</a> standard. The technology is now available as a feature of the multi-modal T5-OmniMatch ABIS. It can be used in both 1:1 and 1:N modes and across all the fingerprint, face and iris biometrics modalities the system supports.

ISO 30136 establishes performance testing definitions and metrics for biometric template protection schemes. The four main characteristics required for a system to comply with the standard are template cancelability, unlinkability, irreversibility and accuracy.

		<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/regula">Regula</a> has integrated its document and biometric verification system into Maza Financial, a fintech company based in the United States, to enhance the onboarding process, particularly regarding KYC procedures.

Before this integration, Maza faced issues with false positives and negatives with the existing digital identity verification (IDV) system. Furthermore, the previous system lacked the level of control over the IDV process that Maza required, which impacted the customer experience.

According to Maza, incorporating Regula Document Reader and Face SDK has improved the customer experience and reduced onboarding costs by 50 percent.

<a href="https://openidentityexchange.org/networks/87/item.html?id=825">The letter</a>, dated July 23, argues that the Digital Identity and Attributes Trust Framework (DIATF) provides a strong basis for the UK to a leader in digital trust. It is only a starting point, however, according to OIX.
