<p>The race to bring more AI features to search is escalating, with Microsoft moving forward with additional tools for Bing. Today, the company began previews for Bing generative search, where the top result for a user's query will be an original response compiled by AI.</p>
<p>The <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://blogs.bing.com/search/July-2024/generativesearch"><ins>blog post</ins></a> about Bing generative search showed a few sample results. In addition to the overview statement, Microsoft will provide links to the main sources that the large-language models and small-language models used to create their answer. It will also have a section of related information. For instance, with the sample query "how long do elephants live," the main summary is followed by videos with information about factors that impact elephant longevity. After the generative results, the usual list of search hits will be displayed.</p>

<p>The US Senate unanimously <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/3696/related-bills">passed</a> a bill on Tuesday designed to hold accountable those who make or share deepfake porn. The Disrupt Explicit Forged Images and Non-Consensual Edits Act (DEFIANCE Act) would allow victims to sue those who create, share or possess AI-generated sexual images or videos using their likeness. The issue took root in the public consciousness after the infamous Taylor Swift deepfake that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/x-confirms-it-blocked-taylor-swift-searches-to-prioritize-safety-153136902.html">circulated among online lowlifes</a> early this year.</p>
<p>The bill would let victims sue for up to $150,000 in damages. That number grows to $250,000 if it’s related to attempted sexual assault, stalking or harassment.</p>

<p>Police departments across Arizona plan to implement the use of drones as part of its first responders to emergency situations. Scottsdale’s police department <a href="https://www.aerodome.com/blog/flock-safety-partnership/">will be the first</a> in the state to use a special fleet of drones that can be sent to potential crime scenes and emergencies by special detection cameras.</p>
<p>The drone technology will come from a new drone startup called <a href="https://www.aerodome.com/">Aerodome</a> and the public safety tech firm <a href="https://www.flocksafety.com/">Flock Safety</a>, which makes gunshot sensors, analytic software and cameras that can monitor neighborhoods and read license plates. Scottsdale PD’s drones will respond to emergencies in real time to provide first responders with a bird’s eye view of emergencies as first responders make their way to the area.</p>

<p>The Nintendo Wii was a bona-fide cultural juggernaut, with over 100 million consoles sold during its lifespan. It was never the biggest console in the world, with a size approximating a paperback book. Modders, however, have managed to shrink the Wii’s footprint way down. They made a functional console that’s no bigger than a keychain, <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2024/07/the-kawaii-is-a-nintendo-wii-the-size-of-a-keychain">as reported by <em>Time Extension</em></a>. As a matter of fact, it actually doubles <em>as</em> a keychain.</p>
<p>The appropriately-named Nintendo Kawaii <a href="https://bitbuilt.net/forums/index.php?threads/kawaii.6474/">is a teensy-weensy Wii</a> that lacks some of the bells and whistles of the original, but it works and can run games from that generation. It’s also quite fetching, with a CNC’d aluminum metal unibody. There are magnetic pogo pin connectors for power, AV support and controllers. There’s also a custom dock that offers support f

<p>Meta has taken down tens of thousands of Instagram accounts from Nigeria as part of a <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://about.fb.com/news/2024/07/combating-financial-sextortion-scams-from-nigeria/"><ins>massive crackdown</ins></a> on sextortion scams. The accounts primarily targeted adult men in the United States, but some also targeted minors, Meta said in an update.</p>
<p>The takedowns are part of a larger effort by Meta to combat sextortion scams on its platform in recent months. Earlier this year, the company added a safety feature in Instagram messages to automatically <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-will-test-nudity-protection-in-messages-to-fight-sextortion-131516318.html"><ins>detect nudity </ins></a>and warn users about potential blackmail scams.

<p>When Reddit said last month that it would block unauthorized data scraping from its site, everyone’s (rightful) first reaction was “AI, AI, AI.” However, now that the change has taken effect, chatbot makers aren’t the only ones being locked out. The widely used forum also appears to be blocking all search engines other than Google, which reportedly inked a deal earlier this year with Reddit <a href="https://www.engadget.com/reddit-is-licensing-its-content-to-google-to-help-train-its-ai-models-200013007.html">worth $60 million annually.</a></p>

<p>CrowdStrike apparently tried to send its millions of clients a $10 Uber Eats gift card on Tuesday.
