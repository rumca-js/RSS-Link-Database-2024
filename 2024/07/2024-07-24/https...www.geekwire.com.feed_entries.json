The 11-year deal begins with the 2025-26 NBA season and will include exclusive streaming rights to 66 regular season games, as well as playoff games. Earlier reports indicated that Amazon was part of the NBA&#8217;s lucrative new media rights package, but questions arose this week after Warner Bros.

This first phase of the project will additionally be matched by up to $125 million from industry partners. &#8220;I look forward to seeing how this effort helps us decarbonize transportation and industrial sectors and&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2024/pacific-nw-hydrogen-hub-launches-phase-1-of-its-program-with-27-5m-federal-award/\">Read More</a>", "id": 924205, "language": "en-US", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2024/pacific-nw-hydrogen-hub-launches-phase-1-of-its-program-with-27-5m-federal-award", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 29, "page_rating_contents": 90, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed", "source_obj__id": 131, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Pacific NW hydrogen hub launches phase 1 of its program with $27.5M federal award", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-07-24T20:41:56+00:00", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"923\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/20240627_121640.jpg\" width=\"1230\" /><br />One one of my recent trips to Spokane for our &#8220;GeekWire on the Road&#8221; series, I ran across a vintage poster in an antique shop, and wondered what year it was from. The poster mentions no year but contains plenty of clues. As is my tendency these days, I wondered if AI could help. Turns out the answer is yes, with some caveats. The brief exercise ended up being a good illustration of the current capabilities and limitations of various AI chatbots, and their need for human collaboration and guidance. Follow along below.

The ports of Seattle and Tacoma along with The Northwest Seaport Alliance applied for grant dollars that would support multiple initiatives to move off of diesel and other fossil fuels, replacing them with electrification and clean sources of hydrogen, ammonia, methanol and biodiesel. Efforts include installing infrastructure to plug ships into the grid and switching from diesel-powered trucks and cargo-moving equipment to cleaner options.
