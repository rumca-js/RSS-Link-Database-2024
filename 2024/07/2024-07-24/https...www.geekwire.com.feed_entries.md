The 11-year deal begins with the 2025-26 NBA season and will include exclusive streaming rights to 66 regular season games, as well as playoff games. Earlier reports indicated that Amazon was part of the NBA&#8217;s lucrative new media rights package, but questions arose this week after Warner Bros. Discovery reportedly said it would match Amazon&#8217;s offer in a bid to retain its longtime contract with the league. “Warner Bros.

The poster mentions no year but contains plenty of clues. As is my tendency these days, I wondered if AI could help. Turns out the answer is yes, with some caveats. The brief exercise ended up being a good illustration of the current capabilities and limitations of various AI chatbots, and their need for human collaboration and guidance. Follow along below.

Air travel is back to pre-pandemic levels and demand is expected to keep growing, said Washington Lt. Gov. Denny Heck, speaking to GeekWire from Farnborough. When you combine that growth with the aerospace sector&#8217;s commitment to cut its carbon emissions, Heck said, &#8220;that spells opportunity &#8212; especially for a state that has a history of innovation, and has the largest&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/washington-leaders-pitch-states-innovation-in-sustainable-aviation-at-global-aerospace-summit/">Read More</a>

The ports of Seattle and Tacoma along with The Northwest Seaport Alliance applied for grant dollars that would support multiple initiatives to move off of diesel and other fossil fuels, replacing them with electrification and clean sources of hydrogen, ammonia, methanol and biodiesel. Efforts include installing infrastructure to plug ships into the grid and switching from diesel-powered trucks and cargo-moving equipment to cleaner options.
