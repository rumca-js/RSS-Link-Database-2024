OpenAI CTO admits the risk of AI’s ability to persuade, influence, and control users. This video explains if that is indeed likely by showing what is already happening outside the realm of AI and then testing the AI for its ability to influence by creating ads.

Privacy keeps your data away from AI and the ability of Big tech to pass your personal profile using Retrieval augmented generation (RAG).
