While EA Sports delivered on that front with the NCAA Football series, it's been dormant for a long time due to various issues. Against all odds, a sequel finally materialized in College Football 25.\n\nBoasting thousands of players and numerous teams, several with authentic uniforms and mascots, the attention to detail is simply staggering, bolstered by gorgeous fidelity. There's a significant amount of meat to the experience, from Rise to Glory and Dynasty to Ultimate Team and Road to the College Football Playoffs. One can create a custom player or coach a team to the top.\n\nCollege Football 25 has several issues, from omissions in its offline modes to strange design decisions, which can hamper the experience. Nevertheless, it's an enjoyable experience that captures the essence of the sport with a solid gameplay framework.", "id": 924493, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIhklpOmzPc", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "source_obj__id": 129, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/lIhklpOmzPc/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "EA Sports College Football 25 Review - The Final Verdict", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-07-24T17:30:06+00:00", "description": "Believe it or not, it\u2019s been more than nine years since The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt was released on last gen consoles and PC.

It was only last year, when Phantom Liberty was released, Cyberpunk 2077 seems to be in a much better condition. \n\nNow that CDPR has moved on from Cyberpunk 2077 and are completely focused on the next Witcher, what do we know about it?
