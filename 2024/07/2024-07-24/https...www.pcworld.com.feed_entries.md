<p>There’s a lot of enthusiasm surrounding AMD’s next-gen desktop CPUs, which were announced for a release <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2353326/amd-ryzen-9000-cpus-aim-to-defeat-intel-chips-in-high-end-desktop-pcs.html">at the end of this month</a>. I’m sorry to report that you’ll need to curb it, at least for a couple of weeks. AMD has amended the launch date for the Ryzen 9000 series to August 8th for Ryzen 5/7 chips and August 15th for Ryzen 9. Apologies for the technical industry jargon, but: phooey. </p>



<p>An AMD representative told PCWorld that the delay is due to a quality issue with the first wave of chips. The company wanted to be abundantly cautious, and considering the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2326812/intel-is-not-recommending-baseline-power-profiles-to-fix-crashing-cpus.html">high-profile issues</a> Intel has had with its

<p>Microsoft is making a big push to get Windows laptops running Arm hardware, the same transition that Apple made over four years ago. Qualcomm is partner in the effort, putting its <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2378322/qualcomm-adreno-x1-vs-intel-arc-real-world-performance-in-7-games.html">flagship Snapdragon X Elite chips</a> into tons of new laptops, including the latest Surface designs.</p>



<p>But is the Snapdragon X Elite better than the latest Intel and AMD chips? That’s the question Gordon Mah Ung sets out to answer in the latest PCWorld YouTube video.</p>



<p>Gordon spent weeks exhaustively testing the chips in the latest Qualcomm-powered laptops and pitting them head-to-head against their x64-based competition.</p>

<p>Oof, Windows is having a rough week. Only five days after <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2405542/microsoft-releases-boot-tool-to-fix-crowdstrike-disaster.html">a massive CrowdStrike update-slash-outage</a> made headlines for crippling IT infrastructure all over the world (which, admittedly, is a CrowdStrike problem and not a Windows problem), a security update for Windows itself is sending PCs into recovery. The specter of the Blue Screen of Death is haunting IT admins this summer, apparently.</p>



<p>The specific details: the latest July Windows security update might just send you into a BitLocker recovery screen if you’re <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/439533/bitlocker-windows-built-in-encryption-tool.html">using the encryption feature</a>.

<p>Microsoft has dreamed of competing with Chromebooks for many years, having previously pushed products like <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407161/windows-10-s-review.html">Windows 10 S</a> (a limited version of Windows that powered the first Surface Laptop) and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/398764/microsofts-windows-10x-early-look-at-emulator-new-features.html">Windows 10X</a> (some interesting ideas but was canceled and never released).</p>



<p>Today, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2314430/im-not-afraid-of-qualcomms-snapdragon-x-elite.html">Snapdragon X Elite PCs</a> run a “full version of Windows” in many ways—but in using one myself, I’m noticing all kinds of similarities between them and Chromebooks.</p>
