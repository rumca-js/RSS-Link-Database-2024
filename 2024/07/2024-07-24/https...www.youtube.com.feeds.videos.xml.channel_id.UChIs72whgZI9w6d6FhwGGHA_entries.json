Again, it is possible some models ship sooner. The current target is August 15th. We expect to get CPUs for reviews in time for this new release date. AMD provided GN with an official statement. We also provide some (mostly for fun) commentary on the current situation as it relates to Intel's huge CPU mess. Maybe AMD is trying to avoid looking like Intel.\n\nHelp support our independent reporting!

Intel also confirmed that it has excessive voltage issues on 13th & 14th Gen CPUs alike.
