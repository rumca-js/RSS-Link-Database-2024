Curious to get some ideas around a problem we're encountering. We don't necessarily need to scrape the entire retailer site, but our use case is more item specific - when users send us links to items they want, we want to be able to scrape meta data like product name, price, brand, size, etc. It's been very difficult to scale up the number of retailers we can support so was wondering if there was an easier strategy to do this at mass.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Mindful_3281\"> /u/Mindful_3281 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1ebefli/whats_the_best_way_to_scrape_details_from_a_link/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1ebefli/whats_the_best_way_to_scrape_details_from_a_link/\">[comments]</a></span>", "id": 924380, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1ebefli/whats_the_best_way_to_scrape_details_from_a_link", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/.rss", "source_obj__id": 467, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "What's the best way to scrape details from a link containing a specific item?", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-07-24T16:15:28+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hello, i'm a python developer that Is specialized in webscraping.
