AMD has delayed the launch of its Ryzen 9000 CPUs ("Zen 5") to August 15th, with a possibility to ship slightly earlier, due to a non-specific inability to meet "quality expectations." The delay affects all four current models: The Ryzen 9 9950X, R9 9900X, R7 9700X, and R5 9600X are all delayed. Again, it is possible some models ship sooner. The current target is August 15th. We expect to get CPUs for reviews in time for this new release date. AMD provided GN with an official statement. We also provide some (mostly for fun) commentary on the current situation as it relates to Intel's huge CPU mess. Maybe AMD is trying to avoid looking like Intel.

Intel has finally published a statement about the instability of its Raptor Lake and Raptor Lake Refresh CPUs in the 13th & 14th Gen families of CPUs. The Intel 14900K, 13900K, and their alternative CPUs in the same generations now have a confirmed set of issues. Intel has formally acknowledged in a reddit post that its 13 Series CPUs had oxidation issues during at least one point of manufacturing history. It did not adequately define a date range. Intel also confirmed that it has excessive voltage issues on 13th & 14th Gen CPUs alike. The company has failed to adequately reinforce its support "commitments" for customers and has failed to give date ranges or serial numbers to help consumers identify if they are affected. Intel hasn't stated to what extent different CPUs are affected. To our understanding, K-SKUs are hit the hardest.

Intel is putting together a microcode patch to allegedly resolve the excess vol
