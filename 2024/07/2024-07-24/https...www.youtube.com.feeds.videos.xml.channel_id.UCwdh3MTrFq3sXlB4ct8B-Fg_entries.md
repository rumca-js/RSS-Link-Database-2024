Gyrocopters are Dwarfen flying machines whose rotor blades are propelled by an ingenious lightweight steam engine. In this video, Ollie shows you a couple of different ways you can paint the rotor blades on your Gyrocopters and Gyrobombers, so you can choose whether brown leather or tan canvas is a better look for the aviators of your Dwarfen Mountain Holds!

Here is a list of the paints weâ€™ll be using:

Base
Steel Legion Drab
Zandri Dust

Layer
Ushabti Bone

Shade
Agrax Earthshade
Seraphim Sepia

Technical 
Lahmian Medium
