Half of adults in the UK do not regularly read for pleasure, according to new survey data.
  <br /><br />
  The study, commissioned by the charity the Reading Agency, saw 15% of adults reporting that they have never been regular readers, and 35% saying that they are lapsed readers, meaning that they used to read regularly for pleasure, but rarely or never do now.&nbsp;
