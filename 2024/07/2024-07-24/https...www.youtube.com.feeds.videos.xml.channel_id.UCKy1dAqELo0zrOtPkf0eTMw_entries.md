There’s just a staggering amount to get wrong. But there’s also so much to get right… to take what we know and build off of it.
On Episode 4 of Rise or Die, host Dana Swartz (Noble Blood) talks to series creator and executive producer Robert Rodat (Saving Private Ryan). They talk about power and ambition, giving your characters life-and-death stakes, and how family dynamics are essential to the drama in Those About To Die. This episode also features a conversation with actors Joco Macari and Tom Hughes about working with actor Anthony Hopkins, who plays their father, and historical consultant Justin Pollard.

We guide you through the history of the best X-Men games. The X-Men may be one of the biggest superhero franchises in the world, but these mutant freedom fighters haven’t always had the best track record when it comes to video games. X-fans the world over are still feeling the sting of the massive disappointment that was 2011’s X-Men: Destiny. But that’s not to say there haven’t been some truly excellent Marvel games over the years that have prominently featured Marvel’s merry mutants. And with Hugh Jackman’s Logan finally making his MCU debut in Deadpool & Wolverine, there’s no better time to celebrate that gaming legacy. 

From early winners like X-Men: The Arcade Game and X-Men: Children of the Atom to the fan-favorite X-Men Legends series, here’s a look back at the X-Men games that have captured what we love about these colorful yet tragic heroes.
