Concord, the upcoming 5v5 hero shooter from Sony's Firewalk Studios, is bucking the battle pass trend, with its developer telling players, "You own Concord, Concord doesn't own you."
</p><p>
Firewalk Studios announced the news in a <a href="https://x.com/PlayConcord/status/1816141419914093045">series of posts</a> on social media, explaining Concord won't have a battle pass because it "wanted to focus [its] attention on making Concord a rewarding and robust experience on day one, where just playing the game, levelling up your accounts and characters, and completing jobs yields meaningful rewards."
</p><p>In a <a href="https://x.com/markderidder/status/1816152226815172785">seperate post</a>, Concord gameplay animation director Mark DeRidder wrote, "No Battle Pass, folks. You own Concord, Concord doesn't own you."

Apex Legends developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/respawn-entertainment">Respawn Entertainment</a> has said it will once again allow players to purchase the free-to-play shooter's battle passes with in-game premium currency after it announced it would only be selling them for real money starting in Season 22.
</p><p>
Earlier this month, Respawn <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/apex-legends-is-evolving-its-battle-pass-by-splitting-it-in-two-and-charging-players-twice">unveiled a number of controversial changes</a> to Apex Legends' existing battle pass system, in a move it insisted would provide more "value" to players. One of these changes will see the current season-long Battle Pass essentially split in two, with Respawn charging players full price for each half-season premium pass across the

Sure, TV seems to be doing a decent job of making video game adaptations that don't utterly suck these days, but the movie world's still waiting for its The Last of Us moment. Will it come in the form Gearbox's soon-to-be-released Borderlands film? Probably not, but if it's brightly coloured chaos you're after, you can expect plenty of that judging by its newly released "final" trailer - which has been shared ahead of the movie's August launch.
</p><p>
The Borderlands movie has, of course, been a long time coming; it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-movie-in-the-works">initially announced back in 2015</a>, with Saw and Insidious co-creator Leigh Whannell at one point rumoured to be attached. Then, just as it looked like the project had been consigned to the celluloid graveyard, it <a href="https://www.

"I can't say more now. Thanks a lot for everything, truly."

## Meeting the people of PEGI: talking age ratings, gambling, and why their famous voice only got â‚¬200

Something happens at the very beginning before anything else - before you see anything of the game. There's a logo and a voice, and it's deep and posh and English. The words it says are iconic. "PEGI 18," you hear. Or maybe "PEGI 16" or "PEGI 12". It's such a well known phrase that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-voice-actor-behind-pegi-18-says-he-was-paid-just-200">when a man called Richard Wells popped up on TikTok</a> to claim he was the one who said them - and then proved it by saying them - more than 20 million people watched. They left comments saying it gave them goosebumps and that those words represented their childhood, which is a bit worrying given the "18" part. But the overwhelming response proved without a shadow of a doubt that for millions of people, PEG

Sony has released its latest PlayStation 5 system software update, introducing shareable links so players can invite others to quickly jump into their multiplayer sessions.
</p><p>
Sony first <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-ps5-shareable-links-will-let-recipients-join-multiplayer-games-without-being-psn-friends">revealed</a> it was working on shareable multiplayer links for PlayStation 5 back in May. And now, two and a bit months later, the feature (albeit seemingly with certain announced elements still to come) is here as part of the snappily titled 24.05-09.60.00 PS5 update.

"To invite other players [to a game]," explains Sony's <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/support/hardware/ps5/system-software-info/">patch notes</a>, "open the game session action card and select Share Link. Then, scan the QR code with
