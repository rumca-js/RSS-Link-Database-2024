Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the process of trying to turn the mediocre Kamala Harris into a transformational culture icon has begun, and it's as nauseating as you'd expect. Also, huge news here at the Daily Wire as we unveil the trailer for my new film, which will be hitting theaters very soon. Stay tuned for that. And the media says it's sexist to point out that Harris is childless. But that fact is actually very relevant, and I'll explain why.

It only took a day for Kamala Harris to essentially lock up the nomination. Whatever happened to her going out and "earning and winning" nomination?
