  <p id="imXBXO">Apple executives Greg Joswiak and Craig Federighi have made it well known that the company has little interest in getting the iPad prepared for macOS software. During an <a href="https://youtu.be/J7al_Gpolb8?si=23yzcCUK9xZ3GS08">event</a> following Apple’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/10/24173603/wwdc-2024-live-blog-apple-event-ios-18-ai">2024 Worldwide Developers Conference</a> in June, Federighi said, “We want to keep making iPad the best iPad it can be. We are not trying to create a Windows 8 PC or whatever.” But that hasn’t stopped Apple users from craving something more out of their iPads. </p>

  <p id="34VdpQ">CrowdStrike has published a post incident review (PIR) of the buggy update it published that took down 8.5 million Windows machines last week. <a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/falcon-content-update-remediation-and-guidance-hub/">The detailed post blames a bug</a> in test software for not properly validating the content update that was pushed out to millions of machines on Friday. CrowdStrike is promising to more thoroughly test its content updates, improve its error handling, and implement a staggered deployment to avoid a repeat of this disaster.</p>

  <p id="VP9jxF">Years after Twitter replaced the pistol emoji with a green-and-orange water gun, X has decided to change it back to a regular handgun. An X employee announced the change <a href="https://twitter.com/yacineMTB/status/1814050624813793729">in a post</a> last week.</p>
<p id="zWKM2v">The company hasn’t explained the change, but it feels on-brand for Elon Musk’s social network. Twitter <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/12/17229024/twitter-water-gun-emoji-pistol">originally switched its emoji to display a water gun in 2018</a>, following others like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/25/17278902/google-dumping-pistol-emoji-watergun-microsoft">Google and Facebook</a>.
