<p>A new Netflix docuseries spotlights Lou Pearlman, the man behind the Backstreet Boys and ‘NSync – and a criminal mastermind</p><p>With hundreds of millions of records sold, careers that are still thriving in their fourth decade, and admiration from the likes of Taylor Swift, the boy bands the Backstreet Boys and ‘NSync are absolute pop royalty. They were also the creations of one of America’s biggest criminals. It’s this bizarre duality that Netflix’s new docuseries Dirty Pop: The Boy Band Scam explores with energy and style.</p><p>This is the strange, extremely American story of Lou Pearlman, who got the startup money for his boy band empire by crashing his own blimps, and who eventually built a fortune by masterminding what is widely believed to be the longest-running Ponzi scheme in US history. Dirty Pop masterfully captures the many facets of a man who seemed genuinely delighted to be a part of the bands he lovingly put together, even while acting as the casting director of his

## The godfather of competitive eating on secrets, success and physical stress: ‘I am always close to danger or death’

<p>Takeru Kobayashi can eat 50 hotdogs, 41 lobster rolls or 159 tacos in 10 minutes – and it has brought him fame and a healthy income. As he returns to the fray after five years, what will he do next?</p><p>Eating 50 hotdogs in 10 minutes, buns and all, requires training. For Takeru “Tsunami” Kobayashi, the so-called godfather of competitive eating, that means drinking a lot of water. He starts by downing five litres in under 90 seconds, then rests, then repeats the process the next day, drinking more, faster. The goal is to increase the capacity of his stomach and the speed at which it expands. The target: 11 litres in 45&nbsp;seconds. “It’s similar to the idea of building muscle,” he says.</p><p>Kobayashi is competitive eating’s first elite athlete. His career has been a procession of broken records and seemingly impossible feats: 9.7kg (21.3lb) of soba noodles in 12 minutes, <a href="https://majorleagueeating.com/records">9kg of rice balls</a> in 30 minutes, 41 lobster rolls in 10

She hasn’t been back since. “At the time, I thought I had the day off and could hang out with my friends,” says the 18-year-old. “Little did I know, everything was about to change.”</p><p>Two weeks later, Shahtout’s family home in Tel al-Hawa, a neighbourhood in the south of Gaza City, was bombed in an Israeli airstrike. “We had only 10 minutes to evacuate,” she recalls. “I grabbed my laptop, charger and as many books as I could fit into my bag.” Shahtout, a high-achieving student, had plans to study ICT and business at Al-Azhar University. “But the following month, the IDF destroyed that too,” she says.</p> <a href

<p>The fashion designer provides an uneven account of her multicoloured career</p><p>Ever since arriving in swinging 60s London with a bag full of acid-coloured geometric prints and a signature style comprising zigzag eyebrows and pink hair, Zandra Rhodes has prided herself on taking the road less travelled. It is ironic, then, that she has chosen to tell the story of her life “in 50 objects”, a narrative tack that has become standard operating procedure over the last 15 years. Yet such a contradiction is unlikely to give&nbsp;Rhodes much pause for thought. Instead, at least on the evidence of this breathless, unreflective romp through a life that can apparently best be told through “Andy Warhol’s Wig” and the “Diana Ross Turban”, Rhodes presses on regardless.</p><p>At its weakest, this patchy approach creates baffling lacunae. How, for instance, did this self-described academic, conscientious little girl fail to sail through the 11-plus and grammar school? Wasn’t she disappointed? Su
