So, I followed the directions on <a href="https://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Mac">this page</a> and it also didn't go well. I'm certain it's me. </p> <p>I changed the docker-compose.yml file to my server's local IP: 1.2.3.4. I've also changed the ports to 9014 and 9015 since I have stuff running on the default ports. The installation appears to go just fine. And Docker Desktop shows the instance of Wekan running. </p> <p>However, when I try to launch WeKan, it tells me that 1.2.3.4:9014 or to localhost:9014 has dropped the connection. Any ideas why I would get this? My other web services are running and accessible (being YouTrack and NPM). </p> <p>Thank you kindly. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=

This happend to all services except for Filebrowser(another self hosted storage), which has so far been the only fast cloud storage i have managed to set up with a domain(or public ip). i though to myself that i might just use it. but there is not that big of a community(very small problem), no phone app(bigger problem) and there is no option to integrate anything else like collabora or even forms from nextcloud. so

Explaining cryptography basics to tech-illiterate users, general encryption problems, not all clients supporting all features, not to mention the occasional issues with Element's UX, specifically &quot;unread&quot; messages, not being that pleasant - and other clients aren't that much better / lack features we like in Element.</p> <p>In general, the way Matrix works with rooms and stuff doesn't really fit our use case. You can't just have a view with just channels, your DMs are always mixed into your view (on mobile) and the order of rooms change as people post in them. Basically, we are looking for something which has Discord's UI but isn't Discord.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I was looking into remote access methods for some web apps running on my home server. This would just be for myself. I'm behind CGNAT and can't do any port forwarding, so it seems like the two major options would be Cloudflare tunnels or some kind of VPN solution. It seems like with Cloudflare, they'd have access to unencrypted HTTP traffic to your home server. How does this compare to hosting a Wireguard server on a VPS? It seems like you'd have the same issue if you were running something like Nginx Proxy Manager on the VPS to point to local services. Is HAProxy better in this regard? I found a <a href="https://theorangeone.net/posts/wireguard-haproxy-gateway/">blog post </a>mentioning that it can forward traffic without modification. Also in terms of security, is there anything special you'd need to do? Would the VPS have complete access to all the ports on the home server? Appreciate any insight on this!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by
