One of the manifestations of this belief was the WIPO Copyright Treaty, signed in 1996, which extended copyright in important ways. A key element was the prohibition [&#8230;]

If nothing else, it appears the FBI has decided it&#8217;s not worth fighting the &#8220;compelled assistance&#8221; battle again. Several years ago, the DOJ went to court in hopes of forcing Apple to decrypt a phone belonging to the (dead) San Bernardino shooter. It didn&#8217;t go well for the DOJ or the FBI, no matter how [&#8230;]

For years we’ve talked about the growing threat of SIM hijacking, which involves a criminal covertly porting out your phone number from right underneath your nose (quite often with the help of bribed or conned wireless carrier employees). Once they have your phone identity, they have access to most of your personal accounts secured by two-factor [&#8230;]

You probably already know the benefits of learning a language, so let&#8217;s focus on the app. Right off the bat, let&#8217;s be clear about one thing: When we say &#8220;app&#8221; we don&#8217;t mean that you&#8217;re limited to using Babbel on your phone. You can use Babbel on desktop, too, and your progress is synchronized across [&#8230;]

Gather &#8217;round, children, and let me tell you a tale of rate limiting, misinterpreted screenshots, and how half the internet lost its mind over a pretty standard Twitter error. This error was then interpreted through an extremely partisan political prism, leading previous arguments to flip political sides based on who was involved. The desire to [&#8230;]

Apparently the only time Congress can get together to agree to something, it’s to give whoever is President the power to censor speech online. That’s the only conclusion I can come to regarding the widespread support for KOSA (the Kids Online Safety Act), which Senator Chuck Schumer has announced will be coming to the floor [&#8230;]

It&#8217;s always frustrating to watch a trademark dispute occur when the marks in question are non-distinctive or generic in nature. Now, I want to be careful here, because the trademark in question here is one that has been applied in a way slightly different than the generic use of the term is typically used. An [&#8230;]
