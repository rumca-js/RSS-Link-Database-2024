Barium strontium aluminum silicate (BaxSr1−xAl2Si2O8, BSAS) ceramics possess both phase stability and resistance to water vapor corrosion, making them ideal materials for radome technology and electronic packaging. To address the low tolerance of BSAS ceramics to damage and defects, the introduction of nano-reinforcements is an effective approach to enhance their strength and toughness.

It's practically a ritual: As soon as we sit down on the bus or get in line at the post office, we pull out our phones. Studies show average Americans check their phones almost 100 times a day, spending more than five hours daily staring at that pocket-sized screen. While scrolling through social media or checking sports scores may seem like a good way to kill time it may come at a social cost, according to a new study by Sandy Campbell, Ph.D. 24.

The movement of demand toward the "hot" investment vehicle of the moment also affects supply, according to the inexorable logic of markets. Similar to fashion brands fast-tracking production of sought-after items, the cyclic proliferation of certain asset classes raises quality concerns.

A lot of these particles are not directly emitted into the atmosphere from the land or ocean surface but are formed by reactions of gases with oxidants that are in multiple phases in the atmosphere, including the gas-phase, and in water that is in the liquid form in clouds and other particles.

One of the challenges engineers face when developing technologies for use in space is that of different gravities. Mostly, engineers only have access to test beds that reflect either Earth's normal gravity or, if they're fortunate, the microgravity of the ISS. Designing and testing systems for the reduced, but not negligible, gravity on the moon and Mars is much more difficult. But for some systems, it is essential.

Cheese is a relatively simple food. It's made with milk, enzymes—these are proteins that can chop up other proteins—bacterial cultures and salt. Lots of complex chemistry goes into the cheesemaking process, which can determine whether the cheese turns out soft and gooey like mozzarella or hard and fragrant like Parmesan.

## Seabirds are threatened by trawl fisheries, study finds

Seabirds are among the most threatened creatures globally, often due to incidental mortality (bycatch) in fisheries. Several hundreds of thousands of seabirds are thought to be killed worldwide each year by two of the three main types of fishing gear—gillnets and longlines. However, the extent of global mortality in trawl fisheries has remained largely unknown until now.

The 2024 Paris Olympics aim to be the greenest edition on record, and the first compatible with the Paris climate agreement. Talk of "green games" goes back to April 2021. At the time, the Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games (OCOG) had even aspired to carbon neutrality by removing more greenhouse gases from the atmosphere than those generated by the games. However, the reference to net zero was quietly dropped in subsequent communications.
