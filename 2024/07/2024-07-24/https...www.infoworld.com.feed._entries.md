<p>One of the most popular stacks today is combining Spring Java on the back end with a React front end. Implementing a full-stack Spring Java React application requires many decisions along the way. This article helps you get started by laying out a project structure for both ends of the stack, then developing an app that supports basic CRUD operations. My next two articles will build on the foundation we establish here by incorporating a datastore and deploying the application into a production environment.</p>

<p>Data is the lifeblood of the modern organization. It is constantly moving and changing, vast in scale and dizzying in velocity. It is widely distributed, available everywhere, driving operations and guiding strategic decisions.</p>



<p>This explains why more and more organizations are implementing an “operational data store.” An operational data store acts as an intermediary between a vast array of data sources and data consumers, including business analysts, developers, and senior decision-makers.</p>



<p>An operational data store is quite different from a <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3629889/what-is-a-data-warehouse-the-source-of-business-intelligence.html">data warehouse</a>

<p>When most software developers think of web APIs, we think of <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2334742/what-is-rest-the-de-facto-web-architecture-standard.html">REST</a>, or Representational State Transfer. With REST, you send a request to a request-specific URL and receive the results in whatever format makes sense for the application.</p>

<p>Meta’s web API system, <a href="https://graphql.org/" rel="nofollow">GraphQL,</a> is a different kind of API. With GraphQL, developers use a strongly typed query language to define both requests and responses, allowing an application to specify exactly what data it needs from an API. Thus GraphQL is meant as a more efficient, structured, and system
