Greece’s Games, by contrast, inspired a great artistic leap forward as sculptors and vase painters learned the language of speed.</p><p>The revival of the Olympics at the end of the 18

This musical comedy from Australia takes that chest-squeezing feeling and magnifies it to the power of 100 in this glittery, garish, girl-fantasy pop concert of a show.</p><p>Edna (Jasmine Elcock) is a gawky 14-year-old from Sydney with a crush the size of her continent on pop star Harry. Played by Thomas Grant as a blend of Harry Styles and early-era Robbie Williams, with a twist of Justin Timberlake, he is the lead singer of the boyband Heartbreak Nation. The group’s forthcoming concert in town sets off a plot that goes from securing a ticket to a quest to liberate Harry from what Edna perceives as the unhappy prison of his fame.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/articl

<p>Looking for rising stars this summer? Try gossipy standup, an end-of-the-pier homage and a ‘gay witch sex cult’</p><p>Frankie Monroe, the impish proprietor of a working men’s club who has made a Faustian pact to keep his establishment open, is bound to be a breakout star at this year’s fringe. His creator, Joe Kent-Walters, grew up on a diet of The Mighty Boosh and Vic and Bob. He started out running an alternative comedy night in the basement of his Leeds student house. Frankie was inspired by regulars at the working men’s club where Kent-Walters grew up in Huddersfield: “These slightly ghoulish old men who love to trick you.” The show immerses us in Frankie’s “mad place”, as he stalks the stage, playing with the audience, and singing catchy tunes. It’s an absurd, exciting show that pays homage to end-of-the pier humour and laments the closure of northern clubs: “Against the odds, you want him to win.”<br /><em><a href="https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/joe-kent-walters-is-fra

<p>A savage indictment of years of Conservative rule and how social democracy can set it right</p><p>No sooner had the exit poll dropped on election night than commentators were warning that Labour had a mountain to climb&nbsp;and there was no time for complacency. But Keir Starmer did not&nbsp;need telling. He has a mountain-climbing expression, all tense determination and hovering unease. Contrast the gung-ho simplicity of Boris Johnson’s “Get Brexit Done” with Starmer’s dogged mantra: “Let’s get to work”. Or set Tony Blair’s 1997 victory speech (“A new dawn has broken, has it not?”) against Starmer’s promise of “the sunlight of hope, pale at first but getting stronger through the day”. Pale sunlight is the perfect metaphor for Starmerite realism.</p><p>The election may have been more a&nbsp;rejection of the Tories than a love letter to Labour, but then there was so&nbsp;much to reject. Of the five prime ministers, representing five flavours of&nbsp;failure, David Cameron is this bo

As a kid, I’d sooner hang out with my nan than my schoolmates, and as a teenager I got into Gardeners’ World<em> </em>in quite a big way.

My understanding is that they were founded between the wars, though which ones I can’t say. In any case, a consensus had formed – prompted by a spate of hospitalisations – that some fresh legs were required. When the team’s manager suddenly decided it would be OK to use players as young as 35, so long as they were rubbish, he went out on the hunt and found me in the toilet of a gastropub in New Malden.</p> <a href="https://www.thegu

The government has announced a crackdown on kush and called the crisis a national emergency as people are dying from its use, though the exact numbers are unknown. While police raid drug dens, the government burns confiscated drugs, and desperate families turn to the help of ‘kush healers’ who put users in chains.

They were steaming in the heat and it looked, to her, like they were on fire. She was curious, walked past them through the door and saw more of them, some working heavy bags, some fighting shadows, some sparring in a ring. It was the first time she had ever seen anyone box. “And I said to myself, right then: ‘This, this is what I want to do.’”</p><p>She asked the old man running the place if she could join in with the next session.

<p>The UK’s foremost political artist talks through half a century of his work, on show at the Whitechapel Gallery in London</p><p>Even as he hangs work for a retrospective at one of his childhood haunts, London’s Whitechapel Gallery, Peter Kennard seems beset by misgivings. <a href="https://www.whitechapelgallery.org/exhibitions/peter-kennard-archive-of-dissent/">Archive of Dissent</a> is a celebration of 50 years of work by the UK’s foremost political artist, yet he admits to a “ sense of failure of making work like this”.

<p>The Justin Timberlake-fronted boyband and the Backstreet Boys may have conquered the world, but their manager’s huge fraud devastated lives. This is the staggering tale</p><p>His artists called him Big Poppa, but the late boyband mogul Lou Pearlman was also a big old conman, convicted of running a substantial Ponzi scheme which earned him a 25-year prison sentence. He died in custody, after eight years in jail. Dirty Pop: The Boy Band Scam tells the story of how he unleashed Backstreet Boys and ‘NSync on the world, while also engaging in large-scale financial fraud.</p><p>Both are compelling stories, and the combination of the two makes for a surreal and undeniably intriguing spectacle. Pearlman ran a blimp-hire company in the 1980s, with the help of friends who had “Wall Street” connections, and who, according to one of the interviewees here, had some involvement with the mob. He also hired out aircrafts to pop stars and celebrities. After Pearlman saw New Kids on the Block on tel

<p>Jane Schoenbrun confirms her place as a superbly gifted film-maker with the weirdly wonderful story of two misfits finding solace in a creepy TV show </p><p>Cinephiles lie awake at night worrying that talented young film-makers are deserting cinema for TV. Jane Schoenbrun, one of the most gifted around, has just made a superb feature film about a fictional TV show, imagined here with such loving and unnerving intensity that it surely can’t be long before they are called upon to conjure up a dozen or so episodes for real. With a compelling cod-90s score by Schoenbrun’s musical collaborator Alexander Giannascoli, or Alex G, I Saw the TV Glow lives on in my head. It deserves cult classic status without the “cult”; it is deeply scary, deeply strange and deeply sad, a deadly serious new version of Gore Vidal’s Myra Breckinridge for the 2020s.</p><p>Schoenbrun made a brilliant impression with a startling debut in 2021 that exploited the lockdown-Zoom aesthetic with an ingenuity that, for

<p>In a kayak off the Devon coast I witnessed the kind of entitled mindlessness that has ravaged society, and our planet </p><p>On a calm and beautiful morning off the coast of south Devon last week, I was watching a small pod of dolphins from my kayak. I had spotted them from half a mile away, feeding and playing on the surface. They were heading my way, so I sat on the water and waited.</p><p>But from round the headland, at top speed, came a giant twin-engined maritime wankpanzer. Though the dolphins were highly visible and it had plenty of time either to stop or avoid them, it ploughed towards them at full throttle. As it passed, missing them by a few metres, the driver turned and glanced at them, but never checked his speed. The dolphins dived. They briefly reappeared much farther from the coast, after which I didn’t see them again. I could hear the boat long after it disappeared: it sounded like a jetliner. God knows what distress it might have caused the dolphins, which are high
