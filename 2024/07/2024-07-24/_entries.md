A hefty U.S. stocks sell-off sent Wall Street's most watched gauge of market volatility to a three-month high and boosted options trading volume on Wednesday, though strategists saw little evidence of panic.  The S&P 500 slipped 2.3%, on pace for its worst daily loss since late 2022, after Tesla and Alphabet reported lackluster earnings, prompting investors to question if the 2024 rally fueled by Big Tech and artificial intelligence is sustainable.  As stocks tumbled, the Cboe Volatility Index - known as Wall Street's fear gauge because it measures demand for protection against stock swings - shot to 18.46, the highest since late April.

Commercial real estate finance company Blackstone Mortgage Trust saw shares drop 10% on Wednesday as the firm cut its dividend 24% in the face of continued strain from vacancy-ravaged office spaces.  It is the latest sign of mounting woe for commercial real estate, which analysts say is set for a multi-decade reckoning as American workers stay rooted in their pandemic-era remote work habits, leaving wide swaths of office space empty at a time when interest rates remain elevated in the Federal Reserve's higher-for-longer world.  "For Blackstone to have to come out and cut dividends, I have to imagine that's going to weigh on some people's minds," said Stephen Buschbom, research director at Trepp, an industry data provider.

The world's largest renewables company reported $802 million in interest expenses in the second quarter, compared with $135 million it paid a year earlier.
