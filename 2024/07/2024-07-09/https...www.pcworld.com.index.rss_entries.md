<p>I honestly can&rsquo;t remember exactly when I switched from Firefox to Chrome. I definitely let Google&rsquo;s &ldquo;new&rdquo; browser stew for a year or two after it came out in 2008, as I was big into Firefox&rsquo;s deep customization and extensions. But eventually the speed of Chrome, and the integration with Android and other Google tools, won me over.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For the last few years it&rsquo;s been a rocky relationship. Google&rsquo;s continual <a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=111346X1569483&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification&amp;xcust=2-1-2384494-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">enshittification</a> of its own Search and YouTube platforms has made this former Android fanboy decidedly lukewarm on the ecosystem. And that&rsquo;s saying nothing of Chrome&rsquo;s more and more memory-hun

<p>Intel&rsquo;s upcoming Lunar Lake platform won&rsquo;t support user-upgradeable or swappable RAM at all. That means you better be sure to get <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/395018/how-much-ram-do-you-need-in-a-laptop.html">all the RAM you need</a> on your Lunar Lake laptop, because you <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2355077/lunar-lake-tops-out-at-32gb-ram-will-not-allow-upgrades.html">can&rsquo;t get more memory</a> without buying a new laptop.</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s a big change for the Intel x86 platform, which has traditionally offered this kind of flexibility. After all, we&rsquo;re talking about PC laptops and not &ldquo;mobile devices&rdquo; running Android or iOS&hellip; right?</p>



<p>But, while the news is shocking on its face, it&rsquo;s not as bad as it sounds. This RAM change will actually help the average PC buyer, and it won&rsqu
