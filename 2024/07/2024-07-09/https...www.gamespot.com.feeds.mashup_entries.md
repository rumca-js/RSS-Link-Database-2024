<p dir="ltr">A small update has arrived to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii/">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone/">Warzone</a> on July 9. This update mostly addresses bug fixes and exploits, but it also makes some adjustments to the Mutations limited-time playlist for multiplayer.</p><p dir="ltr">Season 4 Reloaded is themed around mutations, and the patch notes include changes to two of the special abilities in Modern Warfare 3's Mutations playlist. The Mutated Leaper ability now has a 50% increase to the inner explosive damage, while the radius for that damage is decreased by 79%. The developer says leaps must now travel 18.1m or more for lethal explosive damage to occur. The Mutant Juggernaut mutation is now nerfed with a 25% decrease to maximum health.</p><p dir="ltr">On the Warzone side, the biggest change is the amount of Tac-Sprint Boots that spawn inside the bunkers.

<p>Free-to-play co-op shooter Once Human launches today on PC, iOS, and Android. The game has cross-play, meaning you can play with your friends regardless of what platform they are on. However, cross-progression has some limitations. If you make an account through Steam, for example, you can't transfer your character from Steam to iOS or Android or even to another PC storefront.</p><h3>Once Human Cross-Play</h3><p>A launch Q&amp;A on the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2139460/view/4230650600757463064">Steam page</a> clarifies how cross-play works. The gist is that every platform has access to the same servers. As long as you are on the same server as your friends, you can play with them. It doesn't matter whether you are on Steam, Epic, mobile, or the Once Human launch client "Loading Bay."</p><h3>Once Human Cross-Progression</h3><p>The same Q&amp;A explains cross-progression limitations, though the wording is confusing.
