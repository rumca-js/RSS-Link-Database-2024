<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am wondering if it’s possible to embed a search engine from site A onto site B’s home page?</p> <p>Site B has its own search engine for that website. But we also want our customers to be able to search another website (that we own). The website is on a completely different platform and has its own functioning search engine.</p> <p>What I am wondering is if it’s even possible and what I need to know to be able to do it. Something something… API? That’s my hunch and im stuck. </p> <p>I believe both sites are on completely different platforms, but both use SOLR search (but different versions). Hopefully that makes it easier??</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ohyeesh"> /u/ohyeesh </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/searchengines/comments/1dz6tdb/implement_search_engine_from_site_a_onto_site_b/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/searchengines/comments/1dz6

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Like Google and Yandex, i can browse videos in them and can view the video without having to open youtube or whatever site the video is on and it would be great if there are suggested similar videos on the side from sites other than youtube like on yandex.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/NIGHTMARE1997x"> /u/NIGHTMARE1997x </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/searchengines/comments/1dz4rxj/what_search_engines_allow_me_to_watch_videos/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/searchengines/comments/1dz4rxj/what_search_engines_allow_me_to_watch_videos/">[comments]</a></span>
