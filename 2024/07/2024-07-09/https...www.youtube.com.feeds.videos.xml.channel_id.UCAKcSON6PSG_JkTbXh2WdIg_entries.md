During an interview at The Current, singer-songwriter @FrankTurner  provides historical perspective on the ways musicians have earned a living, noting that perhaps we are seeing a reversion to type. "If you want to make a living as a musician, you're either playing shows or you're sponsored by somebody in some way, shape, or form," Turner says, "both of which are respectable ways of making a living."
