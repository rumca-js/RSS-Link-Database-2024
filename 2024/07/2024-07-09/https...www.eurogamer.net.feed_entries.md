Microsoft has confirmed sweeping changes - including price increases - to its Xbox Game Pass subscription service in the run-up to October's launch of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, which will include the removal of day one releases for its overhauled basic tier.

As reported by <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-game-pass-is-getting-major-changes-with-a-new-tier-without-day-one-games-and-a-range-of-price-increases">Windows Central</a>, which says Microsoft has now confirmed the details, the first big Game Pass change comes with the imminent closure of the $10.99/month Xbox Game Pass for Console. While this will continue to be available to existing members until their subscription expires (notably, from 12th September, Microsoft will only allow users to stack Game Pass for Console for up to 13 m

As is now pretty much tradition, Sony's latest batch of PlayStation Plus catalogue additions for Extra and Premium subscribers have been leaked ahead of an official reveal, with Crisis Core: Final Fantasy 7 Reunion, Remnant 2, and more all reportedly on the way.
</p><p>
That's according to ever-reliable leaker billbil-kun who, writing for <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/playstation-plus-extra-premium-juillet-2024-voici-un-apercu-des-nouveaux-titres-qui-vont-bientot-rejoindre-le-catalogue-de-jeux-54974">Dealabs</a>, says Sony will refresh its PlayStation Plus Extra catalogue on 17th July, adding the following titles:

Vampire Survivors, the minimalist survival RPG from developer Poncle, is joining Apple Arcade in August, along with Temple: Run Legends and  Vision Pro update for Castle Crumble.
</p><p>
Vampire Survivors has, of course, been available on iOS as a free-to-play release for some time, but its Apple Arcade version (Apple Arcade being Apple's &pound;6.99/month game subscription service for iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV) will be ad-free and include some paid DLC.

Specifically, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/vampire-survivors/id6478975337">Vampire Survivors+</a> (the '+' being Apple's way of denoting a game has previously been available on its App Store, usually with in-app purchases) will bundle in its Legacy of the Moonspell and Tides of the Foscari paid expansions.

If the absence of any positive Dead Space 2 remake news has been getting you down, there's at least one new way to get a bit of Necromorph in your life right now, even if it's probably not quite what fans were hoping for. EA's sci-fi horror series is the focus of a new Battlefield 2024 limited-time PvE mode, Outbreak, which is available to play now.
</p><p>
Outbreak, described as a "high-intensity survival mode", pits up to four players against hordes of Augmented Targets (which regrettably look more like slightly fleshy crash test dummies than Necromorphs) as they travel across the Redacted map toward their extraction point.
</p><p>
Starting at the western end, the goal is to pass through eight sectors while facing off against increasingly difficult waves of enemies. Players get one life per wave (downed players respawn

Assassin's Creed Shadows developer Ubisoft has owned up to including a historical re-enactment group's logo in artwork for its upcoming feudal Japan stabathon, and apologised for its use without permission. 
</p><p>
Fans spotted the flag of the Sekigahara Teppo-tai infantryman reenactment group in concept art on Ubisoft's website, and <a href="https://x.com/matchlock_kage/status/1808528705603690498">flagged</a> (sorry) the matter to the group itself (thanks, <a href="https://www.siliconera.com/ubisoft-apologies-for-assassins-creed-shadows-flag-art-infringement/">Siliconera</a>).

Writing on social media, the re-enactment group's cannon chief <a href="https://x.com/matchlock_kage/status/1803034338964963831">said</a> they contacted Ubisoft last month about the issue. Ubisoft later responded, and told them that the online version

Lego fans of a certain age had a bit of a moment last month, when pizza delivery kid Pepper Roni - yes, from stone-cold 1997 classic Lego Island - popped up in a trailer for a new video game. 
</p><p>
The redheaded hero, last seen more than two decades ago, has been resurrected by the Lego Group for a cool cameo in Lego Tycoon: Tilted Towers - a game made for a very different generation of Lego fans, but one which this Lego Island veteran has also had fun with. 
</p><p>
Lego Tycoon is the latest licensed experience for the brick building brand to launch in Fortnite, following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-fortnite-feels-a-minecraft-for-the-metaverse-era">the arrival of Epic Games' main Lego Fortnite mode last year</a> and a smattering of smaller, more experimental mi
