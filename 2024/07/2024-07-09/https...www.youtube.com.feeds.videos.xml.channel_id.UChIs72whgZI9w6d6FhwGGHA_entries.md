The Fractal Mood Mini-ITX tower case was disappointing for us. When the Fractal Mood and its specs were first announced, using the fabric outer shell, we were excited about the mechanics of the case and the (if it worked) clever airflow design. Unfortunately, too many other details are missed in the design, leading to poor thermal balancing between the CPU and GPU chambers, annoying accoustical humming when using our liquid cooler with side-mounted fans, and problems with SSD sled design sometimes blocking exhaust. The Fractal Mood competes somewhat with the Cooler Master NCORE 100 MAX as an alternative, with the main differentiator being that Cooler Master forces a cooler and power supply combination.
