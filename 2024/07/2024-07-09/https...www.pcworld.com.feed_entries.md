<p><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2367019/amazon-prime-day-everything-you-need-to-know.html">Amazon Prime Day</a> is just around the corner on Tuesday, July 16 and Wednesday, July 17. But as you start gearing up to hunt for bargains, be aware that fraudsters are looking to take advantage of you.</p>



<p>Here&rsquo;s one method that&rsquo;s growing popular: fraudsters are creating fake Amazon lookalike websites to lure shoppers, and they&rsquo;re hooking victims with phishing emails that promise enticing Amazon offers.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=111346X1569483&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://sectank.net/magazin/2024/07/09/amazon-prime-day-2024-vorsicht-vor-phishing-und-falschen-amazon-webseiten/&amp;xcust=2-1-2390433-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Sectank</a>, over a thousand new Amazon-related do

<p>People hate printers. They have tons of breakable moving parts and they require expensive ink refills. But it was even worse when HP started making printers that required 24/7 online connectivity and blocked third-party ink cartridges via DRM.</p>



<p>It was so bad that consumers started suing HP&mdash;and HP has finally decided that discretion is the better part of valor and will now discontinue its HP+ e-series printers.</p>

<p>On June 28, Microsoft and Amazon announced a new partnership that offers an exciting new opportunity for gamers: anyone who has Xbox Game Pass Ultimate can now play hundreds of cloud-enabled games directly via the Xbox app on select Fire TV devices.</p>



<p>The whole thing works without an Xbox console. That means you can now play Xbox games even if you don&rsquo;t have a console, and you can play when you&rsquo;re away from home without lugging your Xbox around. All you need is, say, a Fire TV Stick and you&rsquo;re good to go.</p>



<p>This innovation brings the massive Xbox Game Pass Ultimate game library to your TV, making these games more accessible. These games include <em>Starfield</em>, <em>Fallout 4</em>, and <em>Forza Horizon 5</em>, as well as many more from external studios.</p>

<p>Back in August 2023, Windows 95 became 28 years old. Official support for Windows 95 ended in 2001, to be replaced by Windows 98, then Windows XP, then Windows Vista. (Oof.)</p>



<p>We&rsquo;ve previously reminisced about the sometimes joyful, sometimes bug- and problem-plagued times we had with Windows 95. But now a different kind of memento has surfaced.</p>

## Logitechâ€™s new gaming mouse packs wireless charging for just $80

<p>A few years ago, the idea of a mouse pad that <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407423/logitech-powerplay-review-wireless-charging-mouse-pad.html">charges your mouse while you play</a> became all the rage. It seems to have died down lately, though, probably because both elements (mouse and mouse pad) were expensive and gamers didn&rsquo;t like being USB-tethered.</p>



<p>But Logitech&rsquo;s new mouse includes the tech for a shockingly low price. The G309 has a fairly unassuming design from the outside. It&rsquo;s neither big nor small, light nor heavy, and its two-mouse-button shooter setup is pretty typical. But it&rsquo;s hiding a couple of surprises inside.</p>



<p>First, it has wireless charging capability using Logitech&rsquo;s proprietary PowerPlay system. <a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=111346X1569483&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://www.logit

<p>Should I buy a Chromebook or a Windows laptop? It&rsquo;s a common question: Both devices can surf the web, access apps, and so on, at home, work, or school. But there are clear differences between their respective platforms, with advantages to each. </p>



<p>We&rsquo;ve addressed the question from several perspectives, beginning with the basics and then diving deeper. In some ways, the two categories have grown closer together over time: With much of our life spent on the web, a web-based device (a Chromebook) has become increasingly similar in purpose to a laptop. We&rsquo;ll define the differences and then advise you on which device to purchase.</p>



<p>We&rsquo;ve reworked this article as a FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) guide. You&rsquo;ll find links to our respective laptop and Chromebook recommendations embedded in the answers, as well as links to re

## What is split tunneling and do you need it in a VPN?

<p>A VPN, or virtual private network, is one of the best ways to boost your privacy online. Not only does it hide your IP address and activities from prying eyes, but it also encrypts your connection for extra security. Unfortunately, a VPN has the drawback of slowing down your internet speeds and limiting some local functionality.</p>



<p>The solution to these problems may be a VPN feature called split tunneling. It allows you to choose which internet traffic you wish to send through a VPN and which to keep separate. This can help speed up your connection and optimize access, but it may also create unintended privacy vulnerabilities. It&rsquo;s worth taking a closer look at this helpful feature to understand better how split tunneling works and whether or not you need it.</p>



<p>Split tunneling is just one of the great features that the top VPNs provide. Check
