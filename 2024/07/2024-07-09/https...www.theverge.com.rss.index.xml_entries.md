  <p id="dp5idF">Microsoft is planning to hike its Xbox Game Pass Ultimate pricing again in September, alongside launching a new “standard” subscription that doesn’t include day-one access to first-party Xbox games.

<p id="EmSwdQ">PC Game Pass subscribers will also see a price hike in September, with the service moving from $9.99 to $11.99 per month. If you’re outside the US and wondering how the price increases affect your own subscription, Microsoft has a full list of all the w<a href="https:/

Though Lucius can vividly recall some moments from his childhood, his memories of his mother Lucilla (Connie Nielsen) seem to have faded by the time he’s crossed paths with power broker Macrinus (Denzel Washington). </
