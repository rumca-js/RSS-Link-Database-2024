<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Good morning everyone</p> <p>I'm completely new to the scene, and I can't find any information online, except fragmented and often sponsored information (which I trust, but not too much).</p> <p>I would like to try using a self-hosting system, for audio video streaming and also for videocalls. The fact is that I don't want to buy a Rasberry Pie right away, and I don't have old PCs to keep on constantly. Can you advise me if there is any service that allows me, for example, to have a Linux server system hosted somewhere, which I and others with my permission can access? Maybe I want to try more services to &quot;play around&quot; with them and I'd rather spend $30 for a month and see how it goes, rather than buy cheap hardware, which already has low performance on its own, and maybe pay not to use it if I find I don't like it /I don't have time/I don't need it.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Nicol

Porkbun has come up, how's that been faring for folks?</p> <p>As an overall goal if that helps, I'm hoping to get NPM a wildcard certificate, and then have it set up to route to all my internal services and TLS it (Proxmox consoles, Adguard, Pihole, Openbooks, etc).

I thought of two ways to achieve this, </p> <p>first is using python docker sdk, but i couldn't get it to create the new container with the exact data of the original container. Probably all my containers are built using docker compose.</p> <p>The second way is using an api provided by apps like watchtower or any alternative. I really want to go with this way but i couldn't find the apis for watchtower. And while we're in the api topic, if there is a way to check the containers that need updating using an api that would save alot of time.</p> <p>Since my app will be lightweight, i want to add another container to the stack that handles the updates, the updates are going to be manual so that it wouldn't screw anything up.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have an odd situation where I'm trying to access a site on my home server from work, but they have my work machine locked down so tight it's blocking HTTP basic auth. Since i don't want to expose the site without security, I've been looking into other ways of doing so. A reverse proxy with an euthentication tool seems to be what I see everywhere, but it seems like a lot of effort and resources (thus a bit overkill) to protect a single site.</p> <p>If anyone can think of anything a bit simpler, i'm all ears.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/RockG"> /u/RockG </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1dyr70u/looking_for_solution_suggestions/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1dyr70u/looking_for_solution_suggestions/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Howdy folks,</p> <p>Really hoping someone can help me figure out what dumb shit I've done to get myself into this mess.</p> <p>So backstory - I have a homelab, it was on a Windows Domain, with DNS running through that Domain Controller. I got the bright idea to try out pihole, got it up and running, tested 1 or 2 machines for a day or 2 just using that with no issues, then decided to switch over. </p> <p>I've got the pihole setup with the same A and CNAME records as the windows DC, so I just switched my router's DNS settings to point to the pihole, leaving the fallback pointing to Cloudflare (1.1.1.1), and switched off the DC.</p> <p>Cut to 6 hours later, suddenly a bunch of my servers and docker containers are freaking out, name resolution not working at all to anything internal. OK, let's try a couple things:</p> <ul> <li>Dig from the broken machines to internal addresses - hmm, it's getting Cloudflare nameserver responses</li> <li>Check cloudflare

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>2 computers went kaput in the same week so I'm forced to work with what I've got for the foreseeable and was hoping to get some input on the system I've landed on and it's efficiency. I do not share my media with others so my streaming is all local. Here's my stack: I'm downloading what I want to watch about 80GB at a time onto my Pixel 6 Pro, then using the app &quot;WiFi FTP Server&quot; to host to an iPad running FTPManager, which allows for streaming through VLC. Am I missing a trick here? I guess I'm wondering if this could be choking up the WiFi unnecessarily!
