<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all. I've been experimenting with Digiview Gold and I'm not able to run the software on higher ROM versions than 2.05. I'd like to run it on 3.1, but no luck so far. Has anyone been able to do this? Or is it possible to digitize with some other software? </p> <p>Softkick doesn't seem to help..</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Roedrev"> /u/Roedrev </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1dz3r53/digiview_on_kickstart_31/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1dz3r53/digiview_on_kickstart_31/">[comments]</a></span>
