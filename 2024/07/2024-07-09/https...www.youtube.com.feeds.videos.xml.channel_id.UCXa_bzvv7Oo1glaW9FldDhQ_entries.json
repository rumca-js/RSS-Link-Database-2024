A live-service looter shooter launches after a suitable, sometimes bordering on excessive, amount of hype. Its player counts, at least on Steam (perhaps other platforms as well), range from underwhelming to horrendous. Then it fades away, popping up occasionally with new seasonal content that barely musters any attention while many wonder how big-time publishers could expect more.\n\nMarvel's Avengers, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, and even Skull and Bones to an extent \u2013 it feels like we've seen some variation on this rule throughout the years.
