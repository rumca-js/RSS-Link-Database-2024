<p>OpenAI models are still accessible through Microsoft Azure’s cloud in China despite the fact that the company <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-25/openai-warns-it-will-block-access-to-ai-tools-from-china" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">has banned the use of these models</a> in the region. The backdoor access to the models is part of a changing dynamic in China’s tech space, where emerging players hope to fill the gap the ban is poised to leave in the market, even as US-based tech firms look to circumvent growing trade restrictions.</p>



<p>Azure China operates as a joint venture with local company 21Vianet in China, which offers OpenAI’s service, according to

<p>Microsoft has ordered its staff in China to use iPhones for their work starting in September.</p>



<p>The decision effectively bars the use of Android smartphones by the tech giant’s Chinese staffers, Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-08/microsoft-orders-china-staff-to-switch-from-android-phones-to-iphones-for-work">reports</a>.</p>



<p>The decision has more to do with standardising use of the Microsoft Authenticator and Identity Pass app among all personnel rather than security concerns about the Android mobile operating system.</p>

<p>If IT leaders were in a statistical analysis class, many would be in a lot of trouble. If students were given a very low reliability element and told to pair it with another low reliability element, a good student would know that the error rate — the risk of bad data results — would get higher. Quite likely much higher.</p>



<p>And yet, some tech leaders seem fine with the idea of combatting generative AI’s bad data — a.k.a. hallucinations — by marrying different genAI programs. Even worse, they are now embracing the idea of using genAI to monitor/manage other genAI as a way to negate hallucinations. Math doesn’t work that way.</p>



<p>Consider: OpenAI recently launched a genAI program to tr

<p>Russia’s state communications watchdog, Roskomnadzor, has <a href="https://t.me/moscowtimes_ru/23616" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">forced Apple to stop offering Virtual Private Network (VPN) apps</a> via the App Store in Russia as that nation continues to censor internal dissent.</p>



<p>The regulator has already blocked access to dozens of VPNs in Russia, and Apple has now removed apps for 25 VPN services, including Proton VPN, <a href="https://x.com/RedShieldVPN_ru/status/1808766482580377616" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Red Shield VPN</a>, and <a href="https://www.le-vpn.com/le-vpn-removed-from-russian-app-store-roskomnadzor/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_bla

<p>Facebook-parent Meta has been working on developing a new <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3715291/what-is-model-quantization-smaller-faster-llms.html">small language model (SLM)</a> compatible with mobile devices with the aim of running on-device applications while mitigating energy consumption during model inferencing tasks, a <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14905">paper</a> published by company researchers showed.  </p>



<p>To set the context, <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3709489/large-language-models-the-foundations-of-generative-ai.html">large language models (LLMs)</a> have a lot more parameters. For instance, Mistral-22B has 22 billion parameters while GPT-4

<p>The AI hype keeps on coming. </p>



<p>The latest news is the arrival of an entirely new line of Windows computers, Copilot + PCs, which are specifically designed with artificial intelligence (AI) in mind. Microsoft claims they’ll dramatically speed up AI, offer new features unavailable to other PCs, and deliver improved battery life. The new machines point the way to the future of Windows and of AI, if the company is to be believed.</p>



<p>Laptops from Acer, ASUS, Dell, HP, Lenovo, Samsung and Microsoft were released several weeks ago, long enough to find out how they perform in real life. So how do they stack up? Are they everything Microsoft claimed they would be, or just one more overhyp

<p>Excel’s Ribbon is great for finding everything you might ever want to do in a spreadsheet, particularly things you don’t do frequently, like managing and querying data connections or automatically grabbing geographic statistics from the internet and inserting them into cells.</p>



<p>But if you’re looking to do things fast, you’ll find keyboard shortcuts far more useful. Why bother to lift your hands from the keyboard if you want to open or close a file, apply formatting to cells, navigate through workbooks, undo and redo actions, calculate all worksheets in all open workbooks, and more? With keyboard shortcuts you won’t have to.</p>



<p>There are keyboard shortcuts to accomplish a vast arra
