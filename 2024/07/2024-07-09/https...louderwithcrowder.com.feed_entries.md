Because she has just claimed that just because Biden may poop his pants from time to time, and just because the man cannot put sentences together, does not mean he cannot hold the job as the most powerful man in the world. Because even the Leader of the Free World “steps in <em>stuff </em>at some point.” </p><p>Goldberg announced that she would be voting for Sleepy Joe and does not “care i
