The tech giants have been lobbying lawmakers for six months to address a controversial minimum pay law for food delivery drivers that went into effect in January. Four months later, Seattle City Council President Sara Nelson introduced a bill that would lower the minimum wage standard for drivers from $26.40 to $19.97 per hour. The council was set to vote on CB 120775 in May, but it\u00a0abruptly postponed the vote to consider amendments. It remains unclear when or if Seattle lawmakers will vote on potential changes.
