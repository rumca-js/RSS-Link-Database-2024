<p>Time for Xbox fans to adjust their budgets. Xbox Game Pass is increasing prices this year in a phased rollout. Beginning on July 10, any new subscribers will be charged the updated price, while current subscribers will see the higher costs take effect starting September 12. For the US, Game Pass Ultimate prices will increase from $17 a month to $20 a month, while a year of access to Game Pass Core will jump from $60 to $75. Microsoft laid out all the regional increases in a <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://assets.xboxservices.com/assets/42/85/42850801-4997-491d-a5bd-69c5bd7948ac.pdf?n=FINAL%20Game%20Pass%20price%20updates%20by%20country%20and%20currency.pdf"><ins>graph</ins></a>.</p>

<p>The Unofficial Apple Weblog (TUAW) has come back online nearly a decade after shutting down. But the once venerable source of Apple news appears to have been transformed by its new owners into an AI-generated content farm.</p>
<p>The site, which ceased operations in 2015, began publishing “new” articles, many of which appear to be nearly identical to content published by MacRumors and other publications, over the past week. But those posts bear the bylines of writers who last worked for TUAW more than a decade ago. The site also has <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.tuaw.com/author/"><ins>an author page</ins></a> featuring the names of former writers along with photos that appear to be AI-generated.</p>

<p>A lot of school districts have instituted smartphone bans for students during the school day but a British boarding school has taken it one step further. Wait, scratch that. They’ve taken it one step back.</p>
<p>Eton College, the historic and elite British boarding school with famous alumni such as Prince William and Harry, Ian Fleming and Tom Hiddleston, has instituted a new mobile phone policy for its first-year students starting in September. Those students will have to leave their smartphones at home but bring their SIM card to school and put it in an old school, offline Nokia cell phone with a simple number pad that can only make phone calls and send text messages, according to <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/eton-college-uk-poshest-private-school-bans-smartphones/"><em>CBS News</em></a>.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, the FTC <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/cases-proceedings/ngl">unanimously banned</a> the social messaging app NGL from hosting minors as part of a $5 million settlement. The first-of-its-kind ban comes after revelations that the company actively marketed the app to children with bait-and-switch tactics, false claims about AI moderation and the targeting of “popular” kids (like cheerleaders) to try to lure others onto the predatory hellscape.</p>
<p>“NGL marketed its app to kids and teens despite knowing that it was exposing them to cyberbullying and harassment,” FTC Chair Lina Khan <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/07/ftc-order-will-ban-ngl-labs-its-founders-offering-anonymous-messaging-apps-kids-under-18-halt">wrote</a> in an agency press release. “In light of NGL’s reckless disregard for kids’ safety, the FTC’s order would ban NGL from marketing or offering its app t

<p>Spotify is bridging the gap between <a href="https://www.engadget.com/you-can-now-listen-to-substack-podcasts-on-spotify-150046948.html">podcasters</a> and their listeners by launching a comment section for podcasts, which will start showing up on episodes today. Listeners can find the service's new comment section by scrolling past the play controls or navigating to the episode page once they're done listening. At launch, all posts will be private by default, and creators will have full control over what comments will show up on their page. They have the power to publish and unpublish any response they want. If they have no time to do that, they can enable comments for specific episodes only or opt out of the feature altogether.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The service is making it possible for all creators to oversee comments by giving them access to the updated Spotify for Podcasters app, whether or not they're hosted by the company. Creators that aren't hosted on the Spotify for Podcasters pla

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-prime-day/">Amazon Prime Day</a> is right around the corner, as it officially starts on July 16. However, some of the best early Prime Day deals are already wafting in like a nice summer breeze. Case in point? You can now pick up a pair of Blink Mini 2 security cameras for $40, which is a discount of 43 percent. This is the latest version of the camera, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/blinks-new-mini-2-offers-a-built-in-spotlight-and-person-detection-for-40-130055057.html">which was originally released earlier this year</a>. That’s a pretty quick turnaround for this kind of massive discount.</p> 
<p>For the uninitiated, the Blink Mini 2 is a tiny security camera with a surprising amount of tech. The image quality has been massively improved over the original model and there’s a built-in LED spotlight that allows for color night vision. The smartphone app displays live 1080p footage with two-way audio and there’s a motion-detection algorith

<p>Nothing’s budget-friendly sub-brand, CMF, is getting experimental with its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nothings-budget-friendly-brand-cmf-announced-three-new-products-including-a-200-smartphone-100417261.html">latest device lineup</a>. There’s a smartphone, watch and earbuds, but I’m most intrigued by the CMF Phone 1. The back cover is interchangeable, so users can swap to different colors and designs on the fly. The company says the removable cover makes accessing the phone’s internal components easy for repairs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There’s also an accessory point on the back cover, which when unscrewed, can attach to fold-out stands, card holders and lanyards. It’s like a customizable case already part of your phone.
