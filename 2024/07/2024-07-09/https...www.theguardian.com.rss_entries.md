<p>Maybe this is how new empires rise. Out of the ruins of the old, with fresh visions and fresh blood, a supremacy that creates its own logic as it goes, until it begins to feel inevitable.

<p>This week’s episode of House of the Dragon killed off another big character, an age-old trick within the fantasy series but one that’s losing its power to surprise</p><p><strong>Major spoilers ahead</strong></p><p>This is an article about character deaths in House of the Dragon, and is therefore packed to the gills with spoilers. If you’re not up to speed with the series, then consider this your final warning.</p><p>This week, House of the Dragon thinned its enormous cast a little. The final third of the most recent episode, The Red Dragon and the Gold, took the form of a vast dragon-on-dragon-on-dragon battle that ended with what seemed like the deaths of two key characters. Rhaenys, played by Eve Best, died when her dragon crashed to the ground with her on its back (also, dragons explode on impact. Who knew?), while Aegon seemed to suffer a similar fate.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/article/2024/jul/09/game-of-thrones-shock-deaths">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Is it gatekeeping or dream-making? Art or science? As the Oscars get set to award casting directors for the first time, British theatre’s finest share the secrets of their trade</p><p>The popular image of auditions today is defined by the cruelty and cringe of reality TV. “People expect Nicole Scherzinger saying, ‘You’ve made it to judges’ houses!’ and Rylan crying,” says freelance casting director Jatinder Chera, one sceptical eyebrow raised. In the media, heartless rejection and impossible dreams seem to be the currency of castings. “But there’s a lot more to it than people really know.”</p><p>So casting directors get a bad rap. They’re seen as gatekeepers, rejectors and ghosters. When Bryony Jarvis-Taylor, deputy head of casting for the National Theatre, mentions her job to someone new, she will often get asked if it’s fun to be so mean. “That could not be further from what I try to do!”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/article/2024/jul/09/mysterious-art-casting-di

Instead of slicing down through the stem and around the pit to create two symmetrical halves, they’d lopped off the narrow top, creating a small opening out of which to scoop the flesh of the avocado. I, mindlessly committed to symmetry, was baffled; I could not understand it.</p><p>The next day I found out who the culprit was.

<p>Netflix’s reality series feels genuinely groundbreaking and deeply, grippingly sweet. You’ll watch these unforced romances unfold with bated breath</p><p>Over the past year or so, British TV has undergone a sort of renaissance when it comes to same-sex dating on reality shows. The Ultimatum: Queer Love. I Kissed a Boy. I Kissed a Girl. The odd gay couple thrown into the mix on Married at First Sight. And now, it seems, Japan is following suit with The Boyfriend on Netflix, the country’s first same-sex reality show. It sees nine men gather in a luxury beach house outside Tokyo for a month in order to, hopefully, meet a new boyfriend. Or maybe just become friends! This is, as we’re very sweetly reminded from the off, “a story of love and friendship”.</p><p>It’s worth pointing out here that The Boyfriend feels relatively groundbreaking in comparison to its UK counterparts (which themselves felt weirdly delayed). Japan still hasn’t legalised same-sex unions – despite the fact <a href="

<p>Oscar nominee Colman Domingo leads an impressive ensemble in a gentle and inspiring story of incarcerated men finding joy in an acting program</p><p>When a siren erupts in Sing Sing – a penitentiary, as depicted in the film of the same name – Colman Domingo’s John “Divine G” Whitfield is among the men in its yard who immediately drop down to the ground, ensuring prison guards don’t mistake them for a threat. He flattens himself, contorting his body so that ankles, palms, fingers, cheeks and even the ridge above his eyes appear to be touching the grass at once. It’s as if he has to let out all the air, along with his humanity, to get down that low. That’s how prison does it.</p><p>We see the cell searches and security checks, and the rigid and soulless ways the men serving out sentences must compose themselves, throughout Sing Sing.

<p>Everyone is down on their luck in the biggest used-goods store in Silesia, but director Łukasz Kowalski finds beauty in many small acts of kindness</p><p>Surreptitiously funny and slyly tragic in equal measures, this Polish documentary, a debut for director Łukasz Kowalski, records the daily business of the biggest second hand shop in Silesia. Unfortunately, this establishment doesn’t do all that much business. When they’re not bickering over money and how little of it there is to distribute in wages, Wiesiek and Jola, the fractious couple who run the joint, are often to be found staring glumly off into space and smoking constantly. Smoke, fire and flame are quite the motif here. A nearby factory spouts fire into the sky all night long. When there’s a problem with the building’s hot water, a cowboy plumber arrives to fix it with his trusty propane torch, an implement of destruction that accidentally melts electrical wires and nearly sets alight the lush fox fur coat Jola is constan

This 1976 film from Hungarian director Zoltán Fábri, adapted from a novel by Ferenc Sánta, is named after something fractionally less dramatic: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_seals">the fifth seal</a>, whose opening reveals the martyrs’ prayers, beseeching God’s vengeance. Martyrdom, of a tragicomically compromised kind, is perhaps the film’s subject.

<p>A Franz Kafka scholar’s perceptive annotation and translation highlights every subtle shade of humour and brilliant aphorism in these singular tales</p><p>In the case, the singular case, of Franz Kafka, the law of diminishing returns might be applied in an adapted form: the more diminished the text, the richer the return. He was a master of the fragment, and an aphorist every bit as great as Nietzsche or Rochefoucauld. Consider these few examples. “A cage went in search of a bird.” “I feel like a Chinaman going home; but then, I am a Chinaman going home.” “There is a destination but no way there; what we refer to as way is hesitation.” “In your struggle with the world, hold the world’s coat.” And then there is that famous, and famously sly, response he gave to his friend Max Brod who had asked if there was any hope to be had in the world: “Plenty of hope – for God – no end of hope – only not for us.”</p><p>In this splendid new selection from Kafka’s fiction – though Kafka’s fiction

<p>A peaceful woodland estate in Aberdeenshire now offers wellbeing breaks with adrenaline-boosting Nordic-style treatments</p><p>I’m sitting in a bright orange tin bath deep in the woods in rural Aberdeenshire. The water is a chilly 8C and I’m being guided through breathing exercises by the UK’s first female commando. This is not a military drill or some kind of cult initiation, but an activity offered at the new <a href="https://www.glendyecabinsandcottages.com/the-discovery-and-adventure-centre-at-glen-dye/">Discovery and Adventure Centre at Glen Dye</a> estate, to which I’ve willingly signed up.<br /><br />
 “Tell yourself it’s cold, but you can do this,” says Pip Delamere-Wright, “Remember top-down thinking, you’re in control. Just keep breathing.” At first the cold water feels like needles against my skin and deep breathing is required to stay in the water, but I do eventually manage to calm my mind. After the required two minutes I sprint across the forest floor back into the s

David was born and raised in Small Heath, Birmingham, where he lived with his older siblings and Barbadian parents. He tells Grace about how his mum kept the flavours of the West Indies alive in his childhood home, while he navigated the racist world of 1970s Britain growing up as a young black boy. Sitting down over his favourite comfort food, David talks about how messing about in school led to the ‘lightbulb moment’ when he realised he wanted to be an actor; arriving in 80s London to attend Rada and discovering the excitement of ‘filthy’ Soho; and the underrated wonders of corned beef</p><p>New episodes of Comfort Eating with Grace Dent will be released every Tuesday</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/audio/2024/jul/09/s7-ep5-david-harewood-actor">Continue reading...</a>

Wellness firms such as ZOE here in the UK – as well as Nutrisense, Levels and Signos – claim to offer insights into how our bodies process food based on monitoring our blood glucose, among other things. But many researchers have begun to question the science behind this.
