Zenless Zone Zero reviewed by Sarah Thwaites on PC, also available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and mobile.

By leaning into early 2000s nostalgia and then blending it with a stylish vision of the future, Zenless Zone Zero crafts an inimitable world that’s easy to get invested in. Exploring New Eridu and getting to know this charming cast both in and out of combat was a thrilling ride I was keen to keep at for hours on end. It’s not necessarily as deep as many of its gameplay inspirations, and momentum-killing hacking puzzles can sometimes sour the mood – but with exhilarating, approachable combat and many extracurricular activities to take care of, it was always easy to turn a corner and get swept up in the captivating culture nonetheless.

## New Xbox Ad Says You Don't Need an Xbox - IGN Daily Fix

In today's Daily Fix:
Microsoft released a new ad reminding gamers that you don't actually need an Xbox to play Xbox games. The ad features the Amazon Fire TV stick, with which you can launch Xbox Game Pass and play Game Pass games via the cloud and a bluetooth controller. It's not a new feature, but this seems to be part of an initiative to get people into the Xbox ecosystem without having to worry about a four-hundred-dollar console (just a monthly subscription to Game Pass Ultimate). But it may have some gamers worried that Microsoft is leaving consoles behind. In related news, one of the year's biggest Xbox titles, Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2, wasn't exactly the smash hit Microsoft was hoping for. The game received very positive reviews, but failed to make the top 10 in games sold in its release month of May. And finally, two Elden Ring players have found a new way to absolutely embarrass Malenia.
