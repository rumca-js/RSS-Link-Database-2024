Researchers from Konstanz have measured the heart rate of bats over several days in the wild, including complete flights—the first time this has been done for a bat species. To record the heart rate of male common noctule bats during flight, the scientists attached heart rate transmitters weighing less than one gram to the animals, which they then accompanied in an airplane while the bats flew, sometimes for more than an hour, in search of food.

Tensor force is a crucial ingredient of the nucleon-nucleon (NN) interaction, and has an important impact on the structural and dynamical properties of the nuclear many-body system. Many efforts have been devoted to studying the influence of the tensor force in the effective NN interaction in the nuclear medium. But less is known about the tensor-force effects from realistic NN interactions.

They harbor exceptionally high levels of biodiversity and a great number of endemic species worldwide, which are also extremely sensitive to the ongoing global climate change. Nevertheless, despite the importance of mountain biodiversity to biogeography and ecology, the underlying mechanisms that generate and maintain the biodiversity are not well understood.

Silicon computer chips have served us well for more than half a century. The tiniest features on chips currently sold are approximately 3 nanometers—a startlingly small size given that a human hair is roughly 80,000 nanometers wide. Reducing the size of features on chips will help us meet our endless need for more memory and processing power in the palm of our hand. But the limit of what can be achieved with standard materials and processes is near.

Do constants of nature—the numbers that determine how things behave, like the speed of light—change over time as the universe expands? Does light get a little tired traveling vast cosmic distances? It was believed that dark matter and dark energy explained these cosmological phenomena, but recent research indicates that our universe has been expanding without dark matter or dark energy.

A crystal is an arrangement of atoms that repeats itself in space, in regular intervals: At every point, the crystal looks exactly the same. In 2012, Nobel Prize winner Frank Wilczek raised the question: Could there also be a time crystal—an object that repeats itself not in space but in time? And could it be possible that a periodic rhythm emerges, even though no specific rhythm is imposed on the system and the interaction between the particles is completely independent of time?

To project their future effect on sea level rise, additional research is required to improve scientists' understanding of these masses of ice. Now, two groups of scientists are undertaking a joint effort to address what has long been a major obstacle to such research.

Antibiotics are widely used in clinical treatment and animal production as an effective means to combat microbial infections. Antimicrobial peptides, as potential alternatives to antibiotics, have shown promising applications. However, owing to their broad‐spectrum antimicrobial activity, most antimicrobial peptides tend to cause imbalance in the host's intestinal flora. In addition, the systemic use of broad‐spectrum drugs for the treatment of localized infections may cause toxicity, which should not be overlooked.
