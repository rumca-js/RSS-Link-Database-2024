The Acolyte isn't shy about adding to the Star Wars lore - especially when it helps their precious stand-in characters win fights they really shouldn't. This time, Mae, out plucky assassin must fight a Jedi Master and when she faces certain death - rather than thinking her way through the challenge she's just handed a victory via writing contrivance. Just as Disney Star Wars intended.
