After the loss of his head, Mike achieved national fame until his death in March 1947. In Fruita, Colorado, United States, an annual \"Mike the Headless Chicken Day\" is held in May. Mike has the record for the longest surviving chicken without a head on Guinness World Records.\"\n\nMore on Wikipedia: \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_the_Headless_Chicken\n\nJoin membership: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGHDQtN_vzFYJaq_Fx1eikg/join\nSecond Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt93hxFmjppL5nLRAX94UrA\nMerch: https://qxir.creator-spring.com/\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/qxir\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/QxirYT\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/profile.php", "id": 897212, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hE1MTaM36sQ", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCGHDQtN_vzFYJaq_Fx1eikg", "source_obj__id": 447, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/hE1MTaM36sQ/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "How to Survive a Beheading | Tales From the Bottle", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
