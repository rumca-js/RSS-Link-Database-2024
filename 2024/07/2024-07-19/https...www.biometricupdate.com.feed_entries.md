		In 2019, San Francisco became the first city in the U.S. to ban facial recognition technology, forcing the police and other agencies to seek approvals for surveillance technology. A new lawsuit from a non-profit group argues, however, that the city’s police have repeatedly flouted the ban and failed to submit proper documentation related to surveillance technologies.

The San Francisco Police Department (SFPD) has already come under scrutiny after a <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202405/police-in-us-cities-that-ban-facial-recognition-asking-others-to-do-it-for-them">May report</a> accused it of asking neighboring forces to search facial recognition database for them.

		Pakistan has achieved significant progress in digital public infrastructure (DPI), the <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2024/07/digital-public-infrastructure-is-transforming-lives-in-pakistan/">World Economic Forum reports</a>, which is important for promoting financial inclusion and citizen empowerment. Some key interventions like the development of national digital identity systems, and mobile money transfer initiatives have had remarkable success to date. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) similarly identifies these digital strides as having the potential to propel socioeconomic conditions if there is better governance and strategic implementation.

		As the global conversation about why DPI is important advances, so is that about how to implement them. A panel of experts during a recent webinar organized by the Center for Strategic and Internation Studies (CSIS) shared tips for successfully implementing DPI, and one of the issues that came out strongly is the imperative nature of knowledge-sharing with countries executing similar projects.

Speakers during the <a href="https://www.csis.org/events/approaches-digital-public-infrastructure-global-south">webinar</a> were experts from Brazil, India, Ukraine, and Zambia. They each described the progress made by these countries in building their DPI ecosystems, the challenges they encountered, the lessons learnt and the perspectives and plans for the future.
