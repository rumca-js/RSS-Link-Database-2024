Disney Star Wars has done nothing but damage to the once great Star Wars name. But the Acolyte show seems to have a specific grudge against the Jedi. The Masters were the great warriors and mentors of history. But in this particular show, even when a character's goal is to eliminate Masters of the Order - they barley register a footnote in the episode.
