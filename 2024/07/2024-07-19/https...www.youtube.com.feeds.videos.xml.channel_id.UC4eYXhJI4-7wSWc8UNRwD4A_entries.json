Switching to \u201cChicas de la Isla,\u201d he used smooth, electric guitar and stunning background vocals for a rendition of the first song he ever made, conveying a relaxed energy fit for a jam with friends.\n\nAfter years of collaborating with all kinds of Puerto Rican artists from Jowell & Randy to Bad Bunny and everyone in between, despite being center stage for his Tiny Desk, D\u00edaz took the opportunity to share the space with a whole crowd of Tiny Desk veterans and newcomers from all across the island. The community feel of his music fueled the energy and excellence of every single musician he shared the Desk with.\n\nSET LIST\n\u201cTodo Bien\u201d\n\u201c", "id": 893598, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCgB07Yy6Xs", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A", "source_obj__id": 225, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/PCgB07Yy6Xs/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "\u00c1lvaro D\u00edaz: Tiny Desk Concert", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
