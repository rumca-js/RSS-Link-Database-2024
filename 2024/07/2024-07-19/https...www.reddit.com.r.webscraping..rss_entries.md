<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>There are two APKs that provide TV channels, &quot;Tele Latino&quot; and &quot;Magis TV.&quot; Is there a way to obtain the m3u URLs for the channels? </p> <p>In fact, Magis TV has the same content as Tele Latino. So, if it's not the same creator, it's someone who managed to get the m3u lists.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/-Pipino"> /u/-Pipino </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1e7huy1/can_an_apk_be_scraped/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1e7huy1/can_an_apk_be_scraped/">[comments]</a></span>

They are using spot.im/OpenWeb for their comments section. I need to click the button at the bottom of the comments container called &quot;show more comments&quot;, but I cannot for the life of me find a way to interact with that third-party code. I've tried by CSS selector, XPath, accessing the shadow root - none of it works. The third-party code shows up in the inspector tool (see screenshot) but not if I check the page source.</p> <p>Does anybody have any ideas? </p> <p><a href="https

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I'm very new to scraping so assume I know nothing. I am attempting to scrape a website for product stock changes. I've found an API for the website however the frontend is always almost 1-2 minutes faster at updating than the API (using the html). What is the reason for this? Where would the frontend be getting its data from?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Fuarkistani"> /u/Fuarkistani </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1e734gy/scraping_frontend_vs_backend/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1e734gy/scraping_frontend_vs_backend/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello! </p> <p>I'm trying my first web scraping project through getting wco-stream episodes from the website but I'm facing some issues.<br /> I understand that for this website, an iframe link is loaded once the play button is pressed, then a get request populates throgh js (i believe) the new src for the video.<br /> I've seen that this new src is simply a link that you can get by doing a get request on the &quot;fake&quot; iframe src, which will return a 302 code with the correct location of the video.<br /> If i do this via curl, i get the link and can access it from internet.<br /> If i take this link and feed it to a wget, i get a 404 error, making me think that this may be a protection on their part in order to avoid scraping, same thing with requqest.get or using cfscrape. The page is like this (<a href="https://g14.cizgifilmlerizle.com/getvid?evid=Kks11MUx7ypWFe2_QTbI86WjhFJVb7ZRFkvhbb6GS0Hbna6HXAsBeOZtmQ4Kz9tO87uLUGiscFqRkqYaFbxnTQnMzN4SHvht
