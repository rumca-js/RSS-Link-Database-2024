<p>CrowdStrike has admitted to pushing out a bad software update, causing many Windows machines running the affected software to crash. The problem, apparently affecting its Falcon platform, brought down servers at airlines, locked up computers at banks, and hurt healthcare services.</p>



<p>“CrowdStrike is actively working with customers impacted by a defect found in a single content update for Windows hosts,” the company said Friday in a post to its blog titled “<a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/statement-on-windows-sensor-update/">Statement on Windows Sensor Update</a>.”</p>



<p>Mac and Linux versions of the software are unaffected, and the incident was not the result of a cyberattac

<p>The run-up to the Olympic Games in Paris this month has been electrifying — and terrifying. The games begin July 26. </p>



<p>Images shown online display routes through the city as <a href="https://factcheck.afp.com/doc.afp.com.362D8G4" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">completely painted purple</a>. Beautiful!</p>



<p>And did you see the new Tom Cruise movie, “Olympics have fallen”? It’s about a terrorist attack that disrupts the Olympics. That movie echoes reports that Paris residents are buying property insurance because experts predict terrorism during the games. </p>



<p>A recent France24 report claimed that 24% of tickets were returned out of fear of terrorism. And both Frenc

<p>Confession time: I know embarrassingly little about car repair, and I couldn’t fix a misbehaving house appliance if my life depended on it (which, on at least a couple occasions, it almost has). Heck, I can barely hang a piece of wall art without screwing <em>something</em> up along the way. When it comes to Android phones, though, well — I’m practically a modern-day mechanic.</p>
