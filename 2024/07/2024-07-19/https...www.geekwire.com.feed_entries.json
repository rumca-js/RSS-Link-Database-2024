GeekWire spotted a new SEC filing on Friday revealing &#8220;Flying Fish Fund III.&#8221; The firm declined to comment in response to an inquiry. Flying Fish raised $70 million for its second fund in 2022, and raised $37 million for its first fund. It invests in early stage machine learning, AI, and robotics startups. The firm initially backed companies based in the Pacific Northwest but expanded its geographic reach after raising the second fund. &#8220;We still have a major emphasis here in our own backyard, and&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2024/filing-indicates-new-fund-for-seattle-venture-capital-firm-flying-fish/\">Read More</a>", "id": 897155, "language": "en-US", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2024/filing-indicates-new-fund-for-seattle-venture-capital-firm-flying-fish", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 29, "page_rating_contents": 90, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed", "source_obj__id": 131, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Filing indicates new fund for Seattle venture capital firm Flying Fish", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-07-19T19:23:40+00:00", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"380\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-19-at-12.16.42%E2%80%AFPM.png\" width=\"696\" /><br />Amazon-owned Twitch has reinstated the account of Donald Trump, three years after the former president was suspended indefinitely by the platform following the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. &#8220;We believe there is value in hearing from presidential nominees directly, when possible,&#8221; Twitch said in a statement to GeekWire on Friday, a day after Trump officially accepted the Republican nomination for president.
