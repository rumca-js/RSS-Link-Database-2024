Apparently, exceptions apply. The &#8220;Thin Blue Line&#8221; is the supposedly united front of law enforcement that protects society against evil. But it&#8217;s not unconditional. If you&#8217;re a good cop, you get frozen out. And, if you&#8217;re a woman, you get treated like most cops treat most women. The &#8220;Blue Line&#8221; often seems to be the [&#8230;]

I’m curious how Republicans would react if AOC suddenly sought to hold a hearing questioning Elon Musk’s bias in endorsing and promoting Donald Trump on ExTwitter. I imagine there would be apocalyptic outrage and nonstop cries of tyranny over such a blatant abuse of power to punish someone for their political views. And they’d be [&#8230;]

This is not great news, even if the law pretty much aligns with case law. Nonetheless, this is concerning.

In 2021, the Tennessee General Assembly approved a [&#8230;]

We&#8217;ve noted a few times that states will soon receive more than $42.5 billion in taxpayer funded broadband subsidies courtesy of the 2021 infrastructure bill. A lot of that money will go to big giant monopolies with terrible track records on subsidy fraud. But a lot of it is also poised to go toward super [&#8230;]
