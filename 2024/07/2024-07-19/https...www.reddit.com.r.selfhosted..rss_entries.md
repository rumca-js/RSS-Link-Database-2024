Ideally, I would like to move that storage to our server, and then use ProjectSend to deliver files to clients for approval.</p> <p>I was also wondering how difficult it would be to add an approval workflow similar to transfer portals, where clients can mark a file as approved or denied with some feedback.</p> <p>The approval workflow isn’t super necessary, but would be a fantastic tool. Really, just looking for advice on how to get started, and if ProjectSend would be a good way to handle what I’m talking about. I appreciate everyone’s feedback!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --
