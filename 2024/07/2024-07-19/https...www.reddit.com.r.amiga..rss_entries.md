<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Who owns what? Is there any active hardware development going on? Will there be any newer versions of AmigaOS 4.x beyond 4.1? Is there any active software development going on? Web Browsers? Applications, etc? I mean, the FireBee project (Atari ST clone) seems to be pretty much dead now. Is that the same status with Amiga-whatever? I mean, after the Intellivision Amico fiasco, I just want to know what is real and what is really dead, yaknow?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Famous-Ebb3041"> /u/Famous-Ebb3041 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1e7hcon/what_actually_is_the_latest_news_concerning_the/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1e7hcon/what_actually_is_the_latest_news_concerning_the/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>A year or two ago I purchased a later Denise chip to add to my Amiga 500. I wanted to purchase an 'adaptor thingy' for it that provided a bunch of extra features. I ended up parking the idea. Now I want to do it again, I can't recall what the name of the company was, what the thing even did! I have old age brain farts going on.</p> <p>I hunted the internet this morning but couldn't find anything, mostly because my search criteria was crap.</p> <p>All I recall is that it was most likely a European company, probably German. The site was bilingual, and two shades of blue a darker and lighter one.</p> <p>The adaptor went inside the machine, you put the new Denise on the adaptor and the adaptor slotted into the old Denise slot on the motherboard.</p> <p>I know this is pathetic, I hope you can help. :(</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/allT0rqu3"> /u/allT0rqu3 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit
