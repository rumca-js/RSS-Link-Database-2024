In this session, we will dive into reflection and its transformative potential within our codebases.\n\nWe will start with an introduction of utilities from the reflection proposal.\n\nThen, we delve deeper into practical applications and demonstrate solutions to problems that commonly use reflection and the power it holds.\n\nFor the last part, we will explore the possibilities within \u201cReflection Libraries\". This includes both \u201ctraditional\u201d libraries which provide functionality, and more \u201cnovel\u201d approaches which reshape users\u2019 code. We will look at examples of what such libraries can cover, and demonstrate potential directions the future holds.\n\nJoin us as we", "id": 895560, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4i45R7sX8I", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCJhay24LTpO1s4bIZxuIqKw", "source_obj__id": 421, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/G4i45R7sX8I/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Keynote: Reflection in C++26 - Welcome to the meta::[[verse]]! - Inbal Levi - ACCU 2024", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
