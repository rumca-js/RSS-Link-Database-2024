Mike the chicken survived for over a year without a head; could a human?


"Mike the Headless Chicken (April 20, 1945 â€“ March 17, 1947) was a male Wyandotte chicken that lived for 18 months after his head had been cut off, surviving because most of his brain stem remained intact and it did not bleed to death due to a blood clot. After the loss of his head, Mike achieved national fame until his death in March 1947. In Fruita, Colorado, United States, an annual "Mike the Headless Chicken Day" is held in May. Mike has the record for the longest surviving chicken without a head on Guinness World Records."
