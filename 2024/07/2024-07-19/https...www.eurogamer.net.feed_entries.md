Pleasingly bizarre four-wheeled survival game Pacific Drive has officially sold 1m copies, and its developer Ironwood Studios has announced it's celebrating that milestone with a series of content updates throughout the rest of this year. And the first of those updates is now live, offering a bunch of free additions, as well as a bit of daft cosmetic DLC.
</p><p>
Pacific Drive's first free update lets players document their travels across the anomaly riddled forests of the Olympic Exclusion Zone using a new photo mode. It's available right from the pause menu and gives player access to various camera settings - including depth of field, focus control, and exposure - as well as numerous aesethetic filters. It's also possible to change weather conditions and time of day while you're in there.

Things are about to get lively on the Sea of Thieves! After spending far too long as giant, trash-talking disembodied head, the nefarious Captain Flameheart finally makes a proper return to Rare's multiplayer pirate adventure next Thursday, 25th July - and he'll be terrorising players with his formidable fire-belching warship as Season 13 gets underway.
</p><p>
As Rare explained <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sea-of-thieves-bumper-2024-bringing-windy-horns-grapple-guns-a-roaming-warship-and-loads-more">earlier this year</a>, that warship, The Burning Blade, serves as a new roving world event out on the waves, giving players the opportunity to go head-to-head against its awesome firepower if they so choose. The Burning Blade is officially the most powerful ship in Sea of Thieves, sporting ten cannons, the abil

## Overwatch 2's new hero is space ranger Juno and she's available to play today

Following a bit of a tease at least year's BlizzCon, Blizzard has given Overwatch 2's 41st hero the full reveal treatment. And that's not all! Juno, as the shooter's new Martian space ranger is known, is available to play today for a limited-time.
</p><p>
When Blizzard first teased Juno last year, she was known only by the codename Space Ranger. It was, however, confirmed, she'd be Overwatch's first Martian character, as well as a "highly mobile support hero". Eight months later and we now have a much clearer idea of who Juno is, as well as what she can do, thanks to a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GspacNMHSbM">brand-new gameplay trailer</a> showcasing her abilities.
</p><p>
Sporting a kind of retrofuturistic look, complete with jet-infused roller-boots and a slinky ray gun, Juno leans heavily on speedy travers

Nintendo has announced a new Pikmin game, but no - it's not Pikmin 5. 
</p><p>
Instead, Japanese Pikmin fans can enjoy Pikmin Counting, a web-based edutainment game where you count from 1 to 100 using Nintendo's colourful garden characters. (It's primarily designed for young kids.)
</p><p>
Pikmin Counting is one of several mini-games available on Nintendo's Japanese website Pikmin Garden, a hub of information on the series with regular news updates of things going on in mobile game Pikmin Bloom, quizzes, and cute Pikmin wallpaper.

Nintendo has announced plans for a big September in-game event for Splatoon 3, accompanied by the launch of new amiibo figurines. 
</p><p>
Fans say this autumn's Grand Festival will likely mark the end of new content for the paint-based shooter threequel, akin to Splatoon 2's Final Fest - though the possibility of other, returning Splatfests remains.
</p><p>
Nintendo will launch four new amiibo figures on 4th September, divided into two specific packs: the Side Order Set featuring Pearl and Marina, as well as the Alterna Set featuring favourites Callie and Marie.

Fresh from its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-fallout-tv-adaptation-nominated-for-16-emmy-awards">nominations for 16 Emmy Awards</a>, the second season of Amazon's Fallout TV show is "ahead of schedule".

Images showing Jack Black as Minecraft character Steve have leaked online, giving the internet an early look at how the upcoming Warner Bros-backed Minecraft movie plans to stylise Mojang's blocky world. 
</p><p>
The designs, which reportedly first surfaced via notorious webforum 4chan, are <a href="https://twitter.com/katsterlingfan/status/1814082541902856273">now</a> being <a href="https://twitter.com/JoshuaTookes/status/1814085730081071372?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">pulled</a> from social media platform X by copyright claims, Eurogamer has noticed. The takedowns all but confirm the images' legitimacy. 
</p><p>
Photos show a bearded Jack Black wearing Steve's trademark blue shirt and jeans, holding a blocky pickaxe. Other images show a mossy-looking Creeper, cuboid bee and a rather cross-eyed pink sheep.

Sega has unveiled a first look at two new Shadow x Sonic Generations levels, delving into the Sonic nemesis' past.
</p><p>
As with the original Sonic Generations, the new separate Shadow campaign will reimagine stages from Shadow's past. So far we've seen the Space Colony level, inspired by Sonic Adventure 2's Final Chase.
</p><p>
Now, in a new teaser video comparing old and new, two more stages have been revealed based on zones from Sonic Heroes and 2006's Sonic the Hedgehog.

The creators of the cult classic Chibi-Robo! series have announced a spiritual successor, koROBO.
</p><p>
Key members of Chibi-Robo!'s development team are working on the project together under the banner of Tiny Wonder Studios, following the closure of their previous studio Skip back in 2020. Founded in 2000, Skip worked closely with Nintendo on more than two dozen games, including Japan-only cult classics such as GameCube title GiFTPiA and bizarre Wii game Captain Rainbow.
</p><p>
As in Chibi-Robo!, Tiny Wonder Studios' koROBO features a tiny household robot embarking on an adventure across the bedroom of his 10-year-old owner and beyond. The little robot will clean up mess and solve various issues around the house, but with a limited battery must bathe in sunlight to recharge at regular intervals.

## Vampire Therapist asks: can a game really teach the fundamentals of therapy?

Yet I have, and now I wonder why I excluded such a possibility in the first place. Games do have a unique power in their interactivity that's perfect for education (though I've sat through enough awful corporate training videos attempting to do the same thing). That Vampire Therapist can teach me concepts usually associated with stuffier education shouldn't really be surprising, then. What's surprising is no one has tried this approach for this topic before.</p><p>Vampire Therapist is a game about seeking and then giving therapy, specifically cognitive behavioural therapy. I've experienced a bit of this in my real life. From what I understand, it's a way of altering thought patterns to ide
