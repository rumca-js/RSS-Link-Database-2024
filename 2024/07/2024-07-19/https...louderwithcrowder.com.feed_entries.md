And as things only got worse for Mr. Potato Head, the media only doubled down and pretended the man was better than ever. But it was only after 50 million people realized the man could not even put together the most basic sentences that they could not ignore this reality much longer.

The presidential campaign is officially official now. Donald Trump is the Republican nominee and running against... k, so maybe nothing is official. Joe Biden may or may not be dropping out by Monday. The candidate may or may not be Kamala Harris, depending on whether Democrats have an open convention, so party leaders may or may not pick someone less terrible. It all depends on what rumor you've read last. Whoever they manage to put forward, they have their work cut out for them to replicate the party vibes from the Trump convention.</p><

Though, in fairness, the campaign isn't sure what Democrat they are campaigning for right now. The confusion is understandable. As Hulkamania and the largest arms in the world* were running wild on the RNC Convention stage**, the Biden-Harris X-Twitter account kept sharing clips of Hulk Hogan*** because they thought it would make Donald Trump look bad. </p><p>To anyone older than whatever zoomer was tweeting for Joe last night, th
