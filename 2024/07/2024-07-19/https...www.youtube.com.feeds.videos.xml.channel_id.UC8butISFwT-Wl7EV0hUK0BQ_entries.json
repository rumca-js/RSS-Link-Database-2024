He's a Machine Learning Engineer and creator of many popular tutorials on YouTube. He's also a frequent freeCodeCamp contributor.\n\nWe talk about:\n\n- How as a kid he hacked into his school's network and gave himself good grades, just like the kid from Wargames. (Don't try this at home.)\n\n- What he learned from helping fix 5,000 people's computers\n\n- How Machine Learning actually works. What the AI models are actually doing for you in the background.\n\n- His advice for anyone getting into Machine Learning in 2024, in terms of what to prioritize learning\n\nCan you guess what song I'm playing on my bass during the intro?
