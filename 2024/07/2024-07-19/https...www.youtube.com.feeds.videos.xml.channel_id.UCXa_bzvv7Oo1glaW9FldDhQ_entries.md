Despite some positive criticism, Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora has flown under the radar since its launch. Its share of flaws notwithstanding, I appreciated the unique story-telling approach and the solid gameplay. The gorgeous visuals and impressive soundtrack also didn't hurt.

The Sky Breaker seemed like it could go in a fresh direction with a focus on the Great Games, but opted for a safer approach by reintroducing the RDA as villains. Not the biggest surprise if you've seen the movies, but the relatively lackluster "new" enemies or gameplay twists, uninspired loot, and spotty AI didn't make for the most engaging gameplay.

Though the DLC looks gorgeous and offers a decent enough distraction, especially for those who can't get enough of the base game, it's a step down in almost every other department.

Whenever you start a video game, it's usually to finish it and then move on to something. Maybe mainlining the story, sampling some side content, perhaps admiring the visuals and collecting the lore, but that's more or less it. Some games make that easy, but some keep giving to the point of absurdity.

It could be with additional content that flows so seamlessly as to keep distracting you. However, it could also be the game's overall structure - initially impressing with its gameplay and continuously upping the ante past what you initially expected. Then you have those titles which continue to receive updates - no strings attached - and provide an incredible experience even after all these years.

Check out our picks for 11 action-adventure games that keep giving, whether in their overall content, attention to detail or sheer quality of gameplay and design.
