Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn reviewed by Jada Griffin on PlayStation 5, also available on PC and Xbox Series X|S.

"While the early hours are a bit rough, Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn is one of those soulslikes that only gets better as you get further in, unlocking more of the interesting skills that allow you to fully take advantage of its attack chains and XP multipliers. However, you’ll need to want to head off the beaten path to hunt down its optional extras in order to get the most out of it. Thankfully, Flintlock respects your time while doing so with its use of shortcuts, fast travel, and other ways of making exploring fun and easy. It may have an abridged run time compared to other RPGs, but it makes good use of that time with interesting sidequests and an excellent minigame. Unfortunately, Flintlock’s story meanders a bit towards the middle and wastes a few opportunities that could have let its main characters shine, but this adventure did leave me interested to find out wher

Pack it up Master Chief, the Halo live-action series is canceled on Paramount Plus. The video game adaptation managed to squeeze out two seasons before getting the gravity axe. Paramount Plus released this statement to The Hollywood Reporter: “We are extremely proud of this ambitious series and would like to thank our partners at Xbox, 343 Industries and Amblin Television, along with showrunner and executive producer David Wiener." They also thanked the cast and went on to say, "We wish everyone the best going forward.” With that in mind, sources have told THR that Amblin, Xbox and 343 are looking to shop the series around, so there might be a chance for a season 3. Really curious to know how many of you all actually watch the series? There was a lot of backlash the series got for the many scenes showcasing a helmetless and occasionally pantsless Master Chief, making the show more about the actor and not the character. Some would argue that the show did little to cater to the hardcore

In today's Daily Fix:
The long-anticipated College Football 24 is a huge success even before launch. Players could get early access to the game starting July 16, but only if they paid almost $100, which could be an extra couple hundred million dollars for publisher EA. In other news, the Federal Trade Commission is not too happy about the Game Pass price hikes (see, the government is just like us), saying the Standard Tier is a "dregraded product." It's widely believed that the price increase was to help offset the cost of Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard. And finally, a Witcher 3 mod will add a reputation system that was scrapped by the original development team. You can find the mod over at Nexus Mods from user FreakVIp.

The Sony Alamo deal marks a historic re-shift, with the Sony Alamo Drafthouse representing the first movie studio to outright own a theater chain in decades, after such things were banned by the Paramount Accords. Alamo Drafthouse is beloved by movie lovers, but with Sony Pictures in the mix, this could mean a radical overhaul for their business. Yes, Sony Pictures Entertainment and Alamo Drafthouse Cinema are smaller players in their industries, but we’re breaking down what the “Sony Buys Alamo” headline really means for movies and how they could be made.

Anyone familiar with visual effects in film and TV knows that most everything is added in post production, after filming the series with actors has wrapped. But what happens when you flip that on its head, and all the crowd scenes, sprawling backdrops and horse races need to be complete before filming can even start?
