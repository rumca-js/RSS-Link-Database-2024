Scientists have discovered how the dangerous Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) defuses our immune response and, in doing so, they have pinpointed an exciting new target for drug developers.

## Early riser! The Sun is already starting its next solar cycle -- despite being halfway through its current one
 - [https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/07/240719123850.htm](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/07/240719123850.htm)

The first rumblings of the Sun's next 11-year solar cycle have been detected in sound waves inside our home star -- even though it is only halfway through its current one. This existing cycle is now at its peak, or 'solar maximum' -- which is when the Sun's magnetic field flips and its poles swap places -- until mid-2025.

## New dawn for space storm alerts could help shield Earth's tech

Space storms could soon be forecasted with greater accuracy than ever before thanks to a big leap forward in our understanding of exactly when a violent solar eruption may hit Earth. Scientists say it is now possible to predict the precise speed a coronal mass ejection (CME) is travelling at and when it will smash into our planet -- even before it has fully erupted from the Sun.

## Come closer: Titanium-48's nuclear structure changes when observed at varying distances
 - [https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/07/240719123844.htm](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/07/240719123844.htm)

Researchers have found that titanium-48 changes from a shell model structure to an alpha-cluster structure depending on the distance from the center of the nucleus. The results upend the conventional understanding of nuclear structure and are expected to provide clues to the Gamow theory on the alpha-decay process that occurs in heavy nuclei, which has not been solved for nearly 100 years.

## The rhythm led by plants is crucial for symbiosis with nutrient-providing bacteria

Recent research on Lotus japonicus, a model leguminous plant, has unveiled that the interaction between legume roots and rhizobia is characterized by periodic gene expression with a six-hour rhythm. This rhythmic gene expression influences the regions of the root susceptible to rhizobial infection and the distribution of nodules. It was also discovered that the plant hormone cytokinin is crucial for maintaining this gene expression rhythm.

When it comes to community hypertension interventions, a new study found that pharmacists and community health workers had the best success in lowering blood pressure. These findings support the idea that hypertension interventions are most successful when they utilize healthcare workers with the most time to give as well as those who have established community relationships.

## New humidity-driven membrane to remove carbon dioxide from the air

New research reveals a promising approach to developing a universal influenza vaccine -- a so-called 'one and done' vaccine that confers lifetime immunity against an evolving virus. The study tested a vaccine platform against the virus considered most likely to trigger the next pandemic.

## 'Secret' hidden structure paves new way of making more efficient and stable perovskite solar cells

Researchers has revealed the existence of surface concavities on individual crystal grains -- which are the fundamental blocks -- of perovskite thin films, and have unraveled their significant effects on the film properties and reliability. Based on this discovery, the team pioneered a new way of making perovskite solar cells more efficient and stable via a chemo-elimination of these grain surface concavities.
