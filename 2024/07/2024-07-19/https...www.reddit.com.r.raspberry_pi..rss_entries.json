I am running fullpageos on two raspberry pis, both with an M.2 SSD. My problem is, when I installed it using either the nightly or the stable version, it will start up and run completely fine the first time I boot it. However, when I unplug it and then turn it back on after connecting the TV literally 3' away from my laptop and HDMI display to test, it boots to just the fullpageos screen and stays there. Doesn't connect to the network so I can SSH it either. I spent 2 hours yesterday trying to figure out what the problem is. One boot gave me the error \u201cxsession; unable to launch &quot;/hone/pi/scripts/start_gui&quot; X session --. &quot;/hone/pi/scripts/start-gui&quot; not found; falling back to default session.\u201d Any ideas? BTW, the other raspberry pi is running smoothly, set up a few months ago.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/iStephenB\"> /u/iStephenB </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://", "id": 897650, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1e78unx/fullpageos_booting_problems", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/.rss", "source_obj__id": 470, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "fullpageos booting problems", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-07-19T14:04:31+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi all, I'm having some issues with a few Raspberry Pi 4 audio players I'm running at the museum I work for. Speakers are connected through the 3.5mm A/V port with an amp in between. Nothing is plugged into the HDMI or USB ports. They're running Raspberry Pi Desktop (64-bit) and start playing a playlist via VLC media player on desktop launch. However, about half the time they do not send audio to the speaker. </p> <p>The power for these audio players is turned on through the museum's security console every morning. From what I have noticed through trying to recreate the issue, the speaker seems to only fail to connect if restarted through the gallery power switching on every morning. When unplugging and plugging in the Pi manually, I have no issue connecting at all. Same with rebooting through the desktop - no issues. I tried adding a light timer plug to turn on the outlet after the gallery's power is switched on, but it seems like that hasn't changed", "id": 897651, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1e74jok/pi_4_audio_player_not_connecting_to_speaker_on", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/.rss", "source_obj__id": 470, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Pi 4 Audio Player Not Connecting to Speaker on Startup", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-07-19T09:23:07+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I just started a project for my PI 4.
