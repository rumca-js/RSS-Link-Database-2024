GeekWire spotted a new SEC filing on Friday revealing &#8220;Flying Fish Fund III.&#8221; The firm declined to comment in response to an inquiry. Flying Fish raised $70 million for its second fund in 2022, and raised $37 million for its first fund. It invests in early stage machine learning, AI, and robotics startups. The firm initially backed companies based in the Pacific Northwest but expanded its geographic reach after raising the second fund. &#8220;We still have a major emphasis here in our own backyard, and&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/filing-indicates-new-fund-for-seattle-venture-capital-firm-flying-fish/">Read More</a>

Twitch said that it will continue to enforce its community guidelines &#8220;and take necessary enforcement action when we identify violations of our rules.&#8221; The live-streaming platform says that it doesn’t have a &#8220;public figure policy,&#8221; meaning all&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/amazons-twitch-reinstates-trump-account-three-years-after-sus

Stranded travelers posted images of the Windows &#8220;Blue Screen of Death&#8221; on airport systems, venting their frustration as United, American and Delta airlines ordered global ground stops while they attempted to recover from the outage. Media organizations, grappling with the impact on their own computer systems, described it as a &#8220;Microsoft outage,&#8221; which was technically correct, albeit incomplete.
