<p>US standup and sitcom star&nbsp;who exuded calm assurance in a career that spanned more than 50 years</p><p>Bob Newhart, who has died aged 94, employed a deadpan delivery, marked with a sometimes stammering hesitation, that made him an unlikely candidate to become one of America’s most successful comedians. It was in keeping with his character that his successes often went overlooked.</p><p>Newhart burst on to the scene with the 1960 release of The Button-Down Mind of Bob Newhart, a recording of his first-ever standup performance just months earlier. It shot to No 1 on record charts, followed six months later by The Button-Down Mind Strikes Back!, which rose to No 2, behind its predecessor. His debut won the 1961 Grammy as album of the year, the sequel won best spoken comedy album, and Newhart was named best new recording artist.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/jul/19/bob-newhart-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The only thing we can say for sure that JD Vance believes is that he, personally, should have as much power as possible</p><p>How many faces does JD Vance have? For one thing, he looks a lot different these days. Around the time the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/17/vance-trump-january-6-election-denial/">election denier</a> first ran for Senate in Ohio, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/2024/07/16/vance-beard-rare-vp-candidate/">in 2022</a>, he grew a beard, perhaps to cover up his decidedly childlike countenance. As rumors swirled this summer that Donald Trump would choose Vance as his running mate – replacing Mike Pence, who left the vice-presidency after a mob of angry Trump supporters tried to hang him – some wondered if maybe Vance would shave. Trump, it seems, <a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/jd-vance-has-a-problem-on-his-face">doesn’t like beards</a>, and prefers his underlings clean-shaven. And JD Vance is – has always been – will

<p>Yale Law School graduate found allies in tech billionaires including Peter Thiel who rallied privately for him</p><p>When JD Vance was a student at Yale Law School in 2011, he attended a talk featuring Peter Thiel, the conservative tech billionaire. Although Vance didn’t know Thiel at the time, over the next decade he would become Thiel’s employee, friend and the recipient of his largesse. Thiel’s millions paved the way for Vance to become a senator.</p><p>Thiel’s talk was “the most significant moment of my time at Yale Law School”, Vance would write <a href="https://thelampmagazine.com/blog/how-i-joined-the-resistance">in a 2020 essay</a> for The Lamp, a Catholic magazine. In Vance’s telling, Thiel’s talk of the failures of elite institutions and belief in Christianity made him reconsider his own faith and immediately make plans for a career outside of law – one that wound through the worlds of tech and venture capital before politics.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tech

The anecdote serves as a trigger for a reflection on the concept of white fragility and the perils of talking about things you don’t understand. It also prompts Mpanga – a British-Ugandan rapper, spoken-word artist and podcaster – to look at his own past choices and politics, noting that he “rose to fame with non-threatening poems that criticised my own community for the problems it faced. I&nbsp;presented a narrative that aligned with ruling-class interests. I made the system look good.”</p><p>A heartfelt, illuminating blend of the personal and political, Mpanga’s book goes on to paint a picture of contemporary Black life as
