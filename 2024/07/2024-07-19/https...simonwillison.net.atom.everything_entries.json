(Actually LLMs are really good at memorization, qualitatively a lot better than humans, sometimes needing just a single update to remember a lot of detail for a long time). But imagine if you were going to be tested, closed book, on reciting arbitrary passages of the internet given the first few words. This is the standard (pre)training objective for models today. The reason doing better is hard is because demonstrations of thinking are \"entangled\" with knowledge, in the training data.</p>\n<p>Therefore, the models have to first get larger before they can get smaller, because we need their (automated) help to refactor and mold the training data into ideal, synthe", "id": 895562, "language": "en-us", "link": "https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jul/19/andrej-karpathy/#atom-everything", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 29, "page_rating_contents": 90, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://simonwillison.net/atom/everything", "source_obj__id": 423, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Quoting Andrej Karpathy", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-07-19T00:11:14+00:00", "description": "<p>Upgrades to <a href=\"https://llm.datasette.io/\">LLM</a> to support the latest models, and a whole bunch of invisible work building out a staging environment for Datasette Cloud.</p>\n<h4 id=\"gpt-4o-mini-and-llm-0-15\">GPT-4o mini and LLM 0.15</h4>\n<p>Today's big news was the release of <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/gpt-4o-mini-advancing-cost-efficient-intelligence/\">GPT-4o mini</a>, which I <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jul/18/gpt-4o-mini/\">wrote about here</a>.
