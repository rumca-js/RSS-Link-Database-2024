<p><strong>First Night of the Proms, Royal Albert Hall</strong><br />A seemingly safe ticket – Handel, Bruckner, Clara Schumann and Beethoven’s Fifth – became in the hands of Elim Chan and the BBCSO a dazzling, joyous launch night</p><p>‘Adventures in classical”, promises the BBC Radio 3 branding at the back of the stage for <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/proms">this year’s Proms season</a>. It’s a slogan certain to irritate sticklers for grammar. But it may also fox anyone tempted to assume that a First Night programme culminating in Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony – perhaps the most famous piece of classical music out there – is less of an “adventure” in 2024, more of a safe bet.</p><p>Particularly as preceded by a Handel favourite, some choral Bruckner, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/sep/12/clara-schumann-was-the-beyonce-of-her-day-she-needs-to-be-heard-more">Clara Schumann</a>’s best-known work and a world premiere too short to frighten anyone.

<ul><li>Lowry leads on -7, two shots clear of Brown and Rose</li><li>2019 winner was distracted by cameraman on 11th</li></ul><p>As the wind whipped, Shane Lowry let rip. Royal Troon’s 11th hole is treacherous enough without unwanted interventions. As Lowry stood above his second shot, a cameraman raised his lens. Lowry arrowed the ball straight left and into a gorse bush. Open Championship bids can be reduced to ruin with moments such as these.</p><p>Television commentators apologised as Lowry’s intemperate ­outburst towards the gentleman who had driven him to distraction was clearly picked up by microphones. Lowry’s mood was barely improved as a member of the public found his stray ball in an area which is perfectly nice to look at but horrible – and sore – to be in. The Irishman would rather have played on with his ­provisional ball. At this point, you could almost see the steam emanating from his ears.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/jul/19/lowry-keeps-

<ul><li>England 21-13 France</li><li>Set-piece superiority guides team to victory</li></ul><p>England claimed a first under-20 world title since 2016 with a victory over France founded on their ruthlessly dominant scrum and a power-packed performance that will have Steve Borthwick licking his lips. Tries from the forwards Joe Bailey and Arthur Green sealed victory in Cape Town with England’s muscle up front proving too much for the defending champions.</p><p>England were unstoppable at scrum time, winning penalties at will less than a week after Borthwick had bemoaned the senior side’s set-piece problems. The props Asher Opoku-Fordjour and Afolabi Fasogbon may soon find themselves fast-tracked, such was their superiority in a pack that was missing its first-choice tighthead in Billy Sela. Others to burnish their reputations were the second-row Junior Kpoku and the flanker Henry Pollock in a performance that bodes well as Borthwick plots a course towards the 2027 World Cup.</p> <a href

The ingredients in the original weren’t anything like those I’ve used here, but it did inspire the cocktail’s name. This is not a strong drink – it is more refreshing and fruity than alcoholic – so it’s ideal as a pre-mix to take on a picnic; if you fancy more of a kick, up the gin by 100ml.</p><p>This recipe is an edited extract from House of Gin: Over 40 Cocktails to Shake, Muddle and Stir at Home, by Andy Clarke, published by Hardie Grant at £14.99.

The very thought will probably shake earnest foodie readers to their core. Albert’s Schloss, you see, is all about <em>fun</em>: noisy, determined, oom-pah-pah fun. It is also about wall-to-wall schnitzel, strudel and currywurst. Eat bacon kroissant royale from 9am and <em>schweinshaxe</em> on a Sunday. There’s a live house band from 4-7pm every night, followed by a nightly “Kunst Cabaret” with singalong piano, dancing ladies, DJs and, of course, more oom-pah-pah. So much endless oom-pah-pah, in fact, that never will one’s oom be so triumphantly pah-pahed. No tickets required and, says the website, everyone welcome.</p><p>“No thank you, Mr Schloss,” you might well be thinking while sliding under the bed. “Please

<p>From the right amount of water to use to the best time of day to take action, here’s an expert guide to one of gardening’s biggest conundrums </p><p>After “What can I do about all these slugs?”, the question I get asked most is “How often should I water my plants?” I would love to&nbsp;say there is an easy answer, but unfortunately the most honest response is “it depends”. There <em>are</em> some rules of thumb, though, that will help you keep your crops hydrated now it’s peak watering season.</p><p>Just like humans, plants need water for most of their biological processes, and different plants have different water requirements. Rosemary, for example, grows best in arid conditions (and needs little watering), whereas watercress can thrive even when partially submerged in the stuff. So your watering plan will depend on what you’re growing, the conditions they’re growing in and the weather.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/article/2024/jul/19/how-often-should-i-w

<p>Why go to a bingo hall when I could be hoisted into a helicopter instead?</p><p>I’ve always enjoyed new experiences – I suppose you could say I’m the adventurous type. In my younger days in London, I worked for a&nbsp;travel agent and was posted to Cape Town. I found the evenings alone there quite dull, so I signed up for a first-aid course. The instructor said I&nbsp;wouldn’t have to pay if I played the role of patient and let him demonstrate bandaging techniques on me. I agreed – I’m a fan of amateur dramatics.</p><p>Back home in London, I put my skills to good use and volunteered for St John Ambulance. I attended its big first-aid competition and met the volunteers acting as patients. I discovered they were also involved in training for the emergency services, pretending to be casualties in mocked-up disasters. They were strategically positioned in&nbsp;car wrecks, derailed trains and various other emergency scenarios, and pretended to have sustained injuries. I thought it sound

<p>The American author on finding sympathy for Ted Hughes, a Palestinian take on Hamlet, and the joy of cookery books</p><p><strong>My earliest reading&nbsp;memory</strong><br />
 Probably The Wonderful Wizard of Oz by L Frank Baum, read to me when I&nbsp;was perhaps three. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;very different from the movie and so was my&nbsp;first introduction to&nbsp;distortions and improvements in screen adaptations, and buried treasure in original texts. The mouse queen in the book completely enchanted me and of course is nowhere in the&nbsp;film.</p><p><strong>My favourite book growing up</strong><br />
 Nine Days to Christmas by Marie Hall Ets and Aurora Labastida, a story of a star-shaped piñata that becomes an actual star in the sky. I suppose it’s about death and eternal life, and magic and grief. It felt powerfully, wonderfully sad to me, though the end involves a kind of resurrection which perhaps through my tears I wasn’t buying.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/a

<p>From yarn bombers to doll modifiers to wood turners, this joyous show – put together by Hetain Patel and Artangel – features 14,000 pieces by diehard hobbyists in one giant gleeful celebration of personal creativity</p><p>Since February, artist Hetain Patel has been gathering hobbyists from across Britain. Quilters, cosplayers and nail-art innovators. Mosaicists, ceramicists and chain-mail linkers. Doll modifiers, wood turners, scrapbookers and yarn bombers. Collectors of postcards, figurines and carrier bags.</p><p>Patel’s exhibition, Come As You Really Are, is a wittily choreographed display of a dizzying 14,000 loaned objects. A long countertop performs as a battlefield to Warhammer figurines, lead soldiers, Star Wars fighters and other tiny fantastical warriors. Across them, Cindy dolls and their dogs stride like Biba-clad colossi. A tiny diorama dressed with greenery from a model railway displays modified acrylic nails, micro origami and thimble-sized ceramics. Quilts, weaving

<p>It’s the year of the properly cut trouser – but a pair of smart shorts can carry you through the summer, whatever the setting</p><p>I<strong>’</strong>m scared of shorts. They make me nervous. This is clearly a bit silly. I mean, it’s not like they are actually going to bite me on the bum. But then fear is seldom rational. If I see a spider in the sink, it doesn’t help at all to know that it isn’t going to hurt me. And I’m not alone in my borderline shorts-phobia. After all, it is perfectly normal to talk about being <em>brave</em> enough to wear shorts.</p><p>This is not just about the brevity of a&nbsp;hemline. Shorts that end halfway up your thighs feels like a more radical choice than a dress that exposes the same amount of leg. Naked dressing has been increasingly normalised – see-through dresses, ab-baring crop tops – but shorts still feel daring in any context outside a holiday.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/article/2024/jul/19/got-a-fear-of-shorts-its-all

<p> A deceptively simple control system underpins this alpinist adventure set on a single deadly massif </p><p>A climber clutches on to a vertiginous rock face, toes digging in, knuckles turning white, a limb trembling from the sheer strain. In this precarious moment, a few options present themselves: move swiftly to rebalance, take a few seconds to rest, or simply let go – praying that the belay holds the weight of a body that has succumbed to the massif.</p><p>Cairn, the new “survival climbing game” from French studio The Game Bakers, is full of such dicey, panicked moments. There is no visible stamina bar, which means that the player must glean all their information from the state of their playable alpinist, Aava. Under acute duress, Aava’s breathing will intensify, becoming quicker and shallower, and her body will begin to tremble. “We want you to focus on her posture and on the handholds in front of you,” says creative director Emeric Thoa.</p><p>Cairn will be out in 2025 <a href

<p><strong>(BMG)<br /></strong>The punk-metal duo formerly known as Slaves offer sandpaper vocals, spine-tingling lyrics and sharp satire on their fiery fourth album</p><p>The fourth album from Soft Play – Isaac Holman and Laurie Vincent’s punk duo, formerly known as Slaves – concludes with one of the most extraordinary tracks of the year. Over a tinny mandolin riff and doleful violin, Holman employs his most abrasive hardcore rasp to lay bare a mind bludgeoned by grief. Everything and Nothing’s juxtaposition of sweetly jangling instrumental with strained, sandpaper vocals is spine-tingling enough, but the lyrics make it a masterpiece. Name-checking a late friend – while also seemingly alluding to Vincent’s partner, who died of cancer in 2020 – the pair tangle mundanity with utter desolation (“white knuckles on the counter in the kitchen”) to create a singularly beautiful and arresting portrait of loss.</p><p>Amazingly, Heavy Jelly also features one of the funniest songs in recent mem

<p>From ancient Roman condiment to vitamin-packed super food, how anchovies made a culinary splash</p><p>The anchovy is the Marmite of the aquatic world. Love it or hate it, neutrality isn’t an option. Seneca, the Stoic philosopher, found them repulsive. Horace was pithier: “They stink.” But Christopher Beckman, horror film producer turned food historian, swears by them. A Twist in the Tail is his delightful tribute to this diminutive fish.</p><p>The anchovy’s reputation, he argues, precedes it. Taste is another matter. Try subtly incorporating some anchovies into an unsuspecting friend’s dinner, and the chances are they wouldn’t notice them. But they may well find the meal more delicious. For anchovies are exploding with umami, that moreish, flavourful “fifth taste”, in marked contrast to the common four: sweet, sour, salty, bitter. It all comes down to “free glutamates”. Most meats and vegetables contain around 100mg of them per 100g. Cured&nbsp;meats, such as prosciutto, and sun-dr

<p>Some Muslim and LGBTQ+ constituents say they would feel uneasy approaching their new MPs including Nigel Farage</p><p>It was a few days before the general election when Arjun* was targeted in the seaside resort of Clacton-on-Sea. “I was with my friends … we were laughed and giggled at. They said: ‘What are you doing here?’ So I ignored it,” he said. “They picked on us because we looked different to everybody else.”</p><p>Arjun moved to the Essex town more than six years ago after growing up in the East Midlands.

Alongside their nets, fuel canisters and food, the men add firewood, metal frames and old car tyres.</p><p>“Farmers have pastures, and us fishermen, too, have feeding grounds we are responsible for,” says Ahmed Dawood. “Our farms are underwater, and our feed is piles of discarded scrap.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/article/2024/jul/19/yemen-fishing-matrah-scrap-waste-underwater-farms-catches-environmentalists-alarm">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This fearless, 60s-set thriller is astonishingly written and acted. It’s so sumptuous that its brilliance threatens to overwhelm you</p><p>I remember reading Margaret Atwood’s Alias Grace many years ago and feeling almost as if I was being beaten about the head with its brilliance. I loved it, admired it, wanted to tell all my friends about it, but I had to take a few days to recover from a sort of cudgelling-by-quality first.</p><p>I feel much the same about Lady in the Lake. This is a seven-part adaptation of the 2019 bestseller of the same name by Laura Lippman, an exceptional thriller writer, that stars Natalie Portman in her first small-screen role and marks visionary director Alma Har’el’s first time as a showrunner. It co-stars Moses Ingram, whose faultless, mesmerising performance should surely sweep the board come awards season. The whole endeavour is a dense, clever, impeccably written, acted, shot and scored offering that is designed to be consumed slowly, episode by epi
