<p>Living in a super-hot climate most of the year has led me to choose a gaming headset with mesh earpads over the stuffy leatherette kind, if only just to stop my ears feeling like jacket potatoes.</p>



<p>But seriously, whoever decided to put mesh in cheap headsets instead of leatherette (with a few exceptions) did me a big favor. It&rsquo;s so much cooler, but it also means if I buy friends and family members gaming headsets during the Black Friday sales I can dodge paying top dollar.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>I&rsquo;ve found that a lot of high-end headsets try to pack in way too many smart technologies that can put a dampener on the audio fidelity&hellip;</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Discovering that nugget of information has led me to double-think everything else I really need in my headset &mdash; from the sound, comfort, a

<p>This story was inspired by some unsolicited tech advice from the TSA.</p>



<p>Coming home from a recent vacation, my wife left her phone at airport security. After a frantic race back from the gate, we were able to get the phone back without issue, along with a tip from the agent who was holding onto it: <em>Put an emergency contact on the lock screen, so whoever finds your phone knows who to call.</em></p>



<p>There are actually a bunch of ways to do this, which I&rsquo;ll explain shortly. But the incident also brought to mind a broader point about how to deal with lost or stolen devices, both before and after the fact. If you have any trips coming up, it&rsquo;s worth taking a few minutes to know your options.</p>

<p>The fact that there&rsquo;s three chip types in AI laptops nowadays: Snapdragon X Series processors, Ryzen AI chips, and Intel x86 chips, even in laptops made by the same OEMs, has left many scratching their heads.</p>



<p>Naturally questions like: Which one is the best? Have become a mantra for consumers overwhelmed by the different options out there.</p>



<p>At the HP Imagine AI event in New York City, I asked Guayente Sanmartin, SVP and division president of commercial systems and display solutions, how HP planned on managing that complex environment for consumers. Her answer? To target the different technologies at consumer personas &mdash; personalizing the experience for each user.</p>



<p>&ldquo;AI is a journey of innovation that&rsquo;s not stopping. The fact that there&rsquo;s a lot of innovation is the best thing that can happen for both technolog
