Welcome back to our regular feature where we write a little bit about some of the games we've been playing over the past few days.

Yet I have, and now I wonder why I excluded such a possibility in the first place. Games do have a unique power in their interactivity that's perfect for education (though I've sat through enough awful corporate training videos attempting to do the same thing). That Vampire Therapist can teach me concepts usually associated with stuffier education shouldn't really be surprising, then. What's surprising is no one has tried this approach for this topic before.</p><p>Vampire Therapist is a game about seeking and then giving therapy, specifically cognitive behavioural therapy.
