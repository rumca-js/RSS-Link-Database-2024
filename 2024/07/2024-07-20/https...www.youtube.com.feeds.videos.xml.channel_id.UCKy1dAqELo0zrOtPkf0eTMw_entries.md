Mr. Wish is one of the rarest Deviations you can find in Once Human. He can either drop on your first try – or your 50th. Mr. Wish only spawns in one specific location, the level 15 Securement Silo - Sigma dungeon. In this video, we will discuss exactly what you need to do to get Mr. Wish, what the Deviation does, and how you can make those runs a bit less complicated and less of a chore. It's also worth noting, this was originally thought to only be possible on a PVP server, whereas we were able to get him on a PVE server as well!
