<p>NASA scientists say pure sulfur has been found on Mars for the first time after the Curiosity rover inadvertently uncovered a cluster of yellow crystals when it drove over a rock. And it looks like the area is filled with it. It’s an unexpected discovery — while minerals containing sulfur have been observed on the Red Planet, elemental sulfur on its own has never been seen there before. “It forms in only a narrow range of conditions that scientists haven’t associated with the history of this location,” according to <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-curiosity-rover-discovers-a-surprise-in-a-martian-rock"><ins>NASA</ins></a>.</p>
<p>Curiosity cracked open the rock on May 30 while driving in a region known as the Gediz Vallis channel, where similar rocks were seen all around. The channel is thought to have been carved by water and debris flows long ago. “Finding a field of stones made of pure sulfur is like finding an oasis in the desert,” said Ash

<p>The global outage caused by a faulty update from cybersecurity provider CrowdStrike on Friday affected some 8.5 million Windows devices, <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2024/07/20/helping-our-customers-through-the-crowdstrike-outage/">Microsoft</a> said in a blog post. The update <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/faulty-cybersecurity-update-takes-out-banks-airlines-and-other-major-companies-worldwide-085142264.html">triggered a blue screen of death</a>, bringing systems used by hospitals, airlines, banks and other major services temporarily to a standstill. Only machines running Windows were affected.</p>
<p>While the issue was mostly resolved by Friday afternoon, Microsoft and CrowdStrike are still dealing with the fallout. In the blog post on Saturday, Microsoft’s VP of Enterprise and OS Security, David Weston, wrote that the company is working with CrowdStrike to “develop a scalable solution that will help Microsoft’s

<p>Sukeban Games is working on what it describes as a &quot;cyberpunk active time action&quot; game with a battle system that's similar to <em>Parasite Eve</em>. In a blog post, Chris of Sukeban has officially <a href="https://sukeban.moe/index.php/2024/07/03/parabellum/">announced</a> <em>.45 PARABELLUM BLOODHOUND</em>, featuring a mercenary named Reila Mikazuchi as its protagonist. Enemies can attack you from anywhere while you're exploring environments in the game, and you'll have to dodge and wait for an action bar to fill before you can launch a counterattack. The action bar fills at a speed based on your character and weapon stats, so the stronger you get, the faster you can fight back.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the announcement doesn't have a in-depth explanation of the game's plot, Chris describes its story as follows: &quot;You play as Reila Mikazuchi; a washed out mercenary whose glory days are long gone. In a last attempt at grabbing life by the horns she decides to go back to the

<p>Rhythm is everything in <em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</em>. On a micro scale, the maiden Yoshiro dances through the game with graceful, measured movements, her steps cleansing the black defilement that has consumed her mountain and its people. In combat, Yoshiro’s protector, Soh, directs their sword in nimble arcs, landing attacks and parries based on timing and flow. On a grand scale, <em>Kunitsu-Gami</em> employs a soothing cadence of frenzied combat and peaceful base building. Soh’s abilities grow into a powerful crescendo as they guide Yoshiro down the mountain, her body deteriorating with each encounter.</p>
<p>Amid these crashing waves of tension and tranquility, <em>Kunitsu-Gami</em> also balances beauty and hellish terror with supreme skill. The slopes of Mt. Kafuku are lush, but its plants, animals and people are slathered in caustic pools of defilement, oil-slick and sticky. Yoshiro and Soh wear layers of delicate fabrics and glinting metallic jewelry, their movem

<p><em>Recent releases in fiction, nonfiction and comics that caught our attention.</em></p>
<h2 id="jump-link-i-was-a-teenage-slasher-by-stephen-graham-jones"><em>I Was a Teenage Slasher</em> by Stephen Graham Jones</h2>
<figure><img alt="The cover for the book I Was a Teenage Slasher" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-07/a761efa0-460c-11ef-adff-1aba8e964367" style="height: 536px; width: 350px;" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
<p>Stephen Graham Jones is something of an expert on slashers. The author has tackled the genre in a slew of his novels (most notably in the Indian Lake Trilogy, with its slasher-movie-obsessed main character) and has an ongoing column in <em>Fangoria</em> dedicated to its impact, so it’s not really a surprise to see he’s churned out another entry for the canon. But this time around, we’re getting a different perspective: the slasher’s point of view.</p>
