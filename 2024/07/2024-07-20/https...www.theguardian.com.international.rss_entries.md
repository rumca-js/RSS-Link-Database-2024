<p>Manager hints his role at St James’ Park is in the balance, saying ‘we’re in the flux of change’</p><p>Newcastle’s players have spent part of the past week helping designers at their new shirt sponsors, Adidas, test embryonic footwear designs intended to hit the high street in five years.

<p>Cinema has often explored the break from the norm that a holiday offers. Guy Lodge gets away from it all with films from home-invasion horrors to sunny comedies</p><p>Holidays in real life tend to go more or less according to plan, as long as your expectations are in check: airport stress, beachside rest, a day or two of lousy weather, a mild sunburn to warm you on your way home. In the movies, however, holidays tend to be life-changing adventures, spanning dramatic personal transformation, sweeping, storybook romance or catastrophic peril. There’s a reason why screenwriters are so fond of taking their characters on a little trip: the timeframe is tightened, the stakes are raised, and as in life, people feel compelled to live a little more freely and boldly than they usually do. All that, and the film gets some pretty destination scenery into the bargain.</p><p>Take the sparring married couple played by Ingrid Bergman and George Sanders in Roberto Rossellini’s <em>Voyage to Italy</

<p>A picnic-able, clever and colourful jarred salad and gorgeous, quiche-like herb and mushroom slices</p><p></p><p>There are two key things to consider for a pleasurable picnic: transport and practicality. You never know exactly what time your fellow picnickers will rock up, nor how far you might end up walking, so you want recipes that are robust and easy to manoeuvre. Equally, you want to keep things simple on the kit front and have things you can eat with your hands. These recipes tick both boxes. They can both also be made the night before and are endlessly adaptable for a low-fuss, very pleasurable picnic indeed.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/article/2024/jul/20/melissa-hemsley-picnic-recipes-herby-mushroom-slices-and-jar-salad">Continue reading...</a>

Apparently I died on 27 July 2004, aged 77. This was news to me.</p><p>The problem was the picture. When you search the name of a notable person, Google may create what it calls a “knowledge panel”, a little box with basic information taken from Wikipedia.

According to his obituary, he was “a distinguished physicist with a literary hinterland”. Google provides a feedback form to resolve
