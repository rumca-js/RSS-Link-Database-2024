<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I've been using <a href="https://github.com/trevorhobenshield/twitter-api-client">twitter-api-client</a> for my bot for about a year, and my code now gets 200 unauthorized errors after running for about thirty minutes. My account also gets logged out once the 200 errors show up. I've heard from a couple people that after enough logouts the account gets suspended.</p> <p>One of the solutions I've heard to this problem is to send the x-client-transaction-id header with every request. Is this what I have to do, and if so how do I do this?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/nshssscholar"> /u/nshssscholar </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1e80pur/twitters_clamping_down/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1e80pur/twitters_clamping_down/">[comments]</a></span>

Then you can see a table with the availability by week.

Any idea how, where should I get information from? I thought about the bots used to buy hyped clothes/sneakers but don't know how they work.
