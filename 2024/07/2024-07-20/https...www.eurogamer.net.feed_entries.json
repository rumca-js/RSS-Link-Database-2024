I'm not just talking about the idle hours that somehow disappear as you play, but the way that the whole game sits within the flow of time itself. Tetris' 40th anniversary is upon us this summer (the exact date is a little woolly, with the Tetris Company putting it in June, but still announcing <a href=\"https://www.start.gg/tournament/tetris-block-party/details\">official celebrations this weekend</a>), and that feels weird from both temporal directions. In one way, the game feels so fresh, so cleanly designed, it can surely only be a few weeks old at most? In the other way, hasn't a design this beautiful been with us since the first galaxies were forming? Wasn't it there in the code of the universe waiting to be unearthed?
