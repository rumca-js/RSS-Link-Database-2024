The external floppy drive makes a continuous grinding noise if a disk is inserted, which doesn't cease until it is removed. The curious thing about this is that the grinding noise is made when the drive is plugged in but it does it either if it is switched on or is switched off. I therefore suspect it may be some sort of mechanical issue rather than a disk reading issue, but I took it apart and had a look under the hood and couldn't find any faults in the mechanisms.</p> <p>This very evening I ran a recently purchased head cleaning disk through them both (dry and the", "id": 901173, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1e84u9q/two_knackered_drives", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/.rss", "source_obj__id": 458, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Two Knackered Drives", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-07-20T18:19:39+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>As title says.

This seems to work quite well, but it comes with the slower boot times.</p> <p>Also tried a pack of hdf files that Retroarch PUAE core can run, they boot almost instantly, but some games seem to have issues. For example F-18 interceptor hangs and doesn't seem to work smoothly.
