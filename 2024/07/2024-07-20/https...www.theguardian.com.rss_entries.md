<p>The ‘highly offensive’ title of ITV’s new comedy may have seen officers’ federation throw its toys out of the pram, but this slight sitcom goes easy on years of reports of corruption</p><p>It’s time for the Police Federation of England and Wales to apply lavender oil to all available pulse points, because the new ITV comedy Piglets is here. When the title of the sitcom about six recruits to the fictional Norbourne training college was announced, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/article/2024/jul/10/police-condemn-itv-new-comedy-show-piglets">the Federation’s condemnation was swift and lengthy</a>. One can only assume that every investigation had been closed and the last criminal in the country locked up that morning and our boys in blue have been looking for a new project ever since. It was, the federation said, “A disgusting choice of language to use for the title of a TV programme,” and “highly offensive to police officers risking their lives to protect the public ever

England contributed massively to the last‑wicket stand that took West Indies from a deficit of 30 to a lead of 41 at the end of the first innings – but perhaps they could be excused for being taken by surprise by what unfolded.</p> <a href="http

<p>The debut novelist on her haunting tale of mothers and daughters, the importance of putting black women on the page and the art form that makes her feel most alive</p><p>Orlaine McDonald, 55, came to writing late, having worked for many years in arts education, taking theatre to schools and pupil referral and youth offending units. After attending a local writing group in her spare time, she started composing poetry and short stories, which led to an MA in creative and life writing at Goldsmiths, University of London. Her debut novel, <em><a href="https://serpentstail.com/work/no-small-thing/">No Small Thing</a></em><em> </em>(Serpent’s Tail), is a spare, haunting tale of three generations of black women newly thrown into living together on a south London housing estate.

Those hardy souls who made it back from the quest invariably reported that, if such a thing existed, they had not managed to locate it. This came as no surprise to elements of both left and right who always maintained that the Labour leader’s animating philosophy was a <em>terra incognita</em> because he stood for nothing. “Keir doesn’t really have any politics,” some of his close colleagues would whisper to me over a lunch table or a cup of tea, saying this in a disapproving tone of voice. That critique persisted through the election campaign, during which the most frequent complaint about the Labour leader was that he was impossible to pin down.</p><p>Well, you can cal

<p>From halloumi to provoleta to comté, sales of overseas cheeses are up as UK tastes turn to the exotic</p><p>“Historically, British cheese has been boring,” said Jonny Crickmore, Suffolk dairy farmer and creator of the award-winning Baron Bigod brie. “If you look back 40 years, it was just cheddar and red leicester, but the British are into stronger, stinkier, softer cheeses now.”</p><p>Sales figures show Crickmore is right: British customers are more cheese curious than ever before. Grocery retailer Ocado.com reports feta sales are up 23.2% on last year while halloumi is up 17.4% and burrata 17%. Traditional cheddar sales have only risen 4%.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/article/2024/jul/20/stronger-stinkier-softer-how-britain-fell-in-love-with-cheese-beyond-cheddar">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Cooking and eating was everything to the author and Guardian columnist. But when she found herself at breaking point, she had to go back to basics</p><p>Three years ago, I fell out of love with food. I didn’t want to shop, I didn’t want to cook. I ate for necessity, not pleasure. The ends of a loaf of bread. An apple. A glass of oat milk. Whatever leftovers were in the fridge.</p><p>It wasn’t just food; everything around me had transformed into shades of monochrome. I couldn’t get out of bed most days, yet I couldn’t sleep.

<p>Many mandolines that cut wafer-thin slices of cucumber, say, often have single-bevelled blades, so need careful sharpening</p><p><strong>How do I keep my mandoline in tune after slicing cucumbers?<br /></strong><em><strong>Steve, USA</strong></em></p><p>I’m no expert on tuning <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandolin">mandolin</a>s, or being able to play one, for that matter, but when it comes to the kitchen instrument, I do have a few tips. First off, there seems to be a sweet spot with a mandoline. Used brand new and fresh out of the box, it will almost certainly result in a nicked finger or knuckle. But a dull mandoline can be just as bad, if not worse, for causing injury, not least because of the extra force you have to employ when pushing an ingredient against a blade that is no longer up to its job.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/article/2024/jul/20/ask-ottolenghi-how-to-keep-a-mandoline-sharp">Continue reading...</a>

It’s on the faces of the athletes, and the lips of those running the show. But there’s something even more fundamental too: a yearning for the Olympics to be spectacular and carefree again. It’s been a while. But after the corruption-soaked chaos of Rio, and the crowd-free Ghost Games of Tokyo, the hope is that Paris will rekindle an old flame. As Étienne Thobois, Paris 2024’s chief executive, puts it: “We want a huge party. And we want that party to be extraordinary.”</p><p>It will certainly start with a bang. As the sun goes down over Paris, a flotilla of boats carrying thousands of athletes will set off down the Seine, cheered on by hundreds of thousands of spectators – 220,000 of whom will be watching for free.

<p>American gymnast has every chance of adding to her medal haul in Paris three years after heartbreak in Japan</p><p>As Simone Biles sprinted down the vault runway at the beginning of the women’s team final of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, the eyes of the world followed her every stride. Biles had already compiled an unprecedented, record-breaking career, marking herself as the greatest ever gymnast and pushing the limits of gymnastics far beyond what anyone could have imagined. Her combination of technique, air-awareness and power had driven her to unheard of successes; she had not been beaten in an all-around competition since 2013.</p><p>But something was wrong. Although the famed Amanar vault is one of the most difficult skills in the world, Biles has made it look easy throughout her career.

<p>The department’s sleepy capital and historic market towns offer a snapshot of  an old-fashioned rural way of life far removed from the tourist trail</p><p>It’s always good to be back in&nbsp;Périgueux. Though the administrative capital of the Dordogne lies in one of the French regions best known to&nbsp;British holidaymakers, it manages to remain relatively innocent of tourism. Yet this sleepy <em>fl</em><em>âneur</em> of a town, built on limestone quays above the River Isle, is full of charm.</p><p>It is, after all, at the heart of a proudly gastronomic region. Tourism contributes almost a quarter of the department’s income. But call the area by its regional name, Périgord, and the lens shifts. This is the country of truffles and <em>cèpes</em>, walnuts, poultry, confit duck and (like it or not) foie gras; of cheeses and sunflowers; figs and freshwater fish; buttery <em>tartines</em> and heady <em>vin de noix</em>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/article/2024/jul/2

<p>Can France’s 7ft 4in NBA rookie of the year and the hosts stop the Americans from claiming a fourth straight gold?</p><p>A positively stacked United States team headlined by LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Joel Embiid and the Olympic debutant Stephen Curry would expect to be hot favourites to win a fourth straight gold when the men’s basketball final tips off on the penultimate day of the Games in Bercy. <em>Quelle surprise, non?</em></p><p>Only getting to this gold medal game – and winning it – won’t be the <em>fait accompli</em> of years past. A cluster of rivals laden with NBA stars including Serbia (the three-time MVP Nikola Jokic), Canada (Shai Gilgeous-Alexander), Australia (Josh Giddey) and Germany (Dennis Schröder) are each capable of offering stiff resistance to the Americans, especially under Fiba rules. But the gnarliest challenge will be posed by France, buoyed up by rollicking home support and a front line featuring 7ft 1in Rudy Gobert, the four-time NBA defensive player o

<p>Pickled peach is wonderful on a green salad or with cheese. It’s also a thrifty way to preserve a summer’s favourite stone fruit</p><p>Pickled peaches elevate any meal, let alone a picnic. This sweet delicacy is lovely sliced on top of a green salad, served with cheese (especially burrata) or eaten just as it is straight out of the jar. The sweet vinegar solution is just as incredible, and should be treasured for its remarkable flavour: use it instead of vinegar and/or sweetening agent in everything from salad dressings to pouring over ice-cream. Pickling recipes are usually designed to preserve huge gluts of fruit or vegetables, which is great if you’re lucky enough to have your own crop, spot a bargain or are gifted a box, but what if we find ourselves with only a smaller surplus of, say, a peach or two that we might want to preserve or transform? I’ve devised this recipe to preserve just two peaches, so scale up as necessary.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/article

<p>France has 56 reactors – more than any other European nation. What is it like to swim, play and live in their shadow?</p><p>Rain or shine, Christiane Lamiraud, 63, likes to swim in the Channel from the beach near her home in the village of Saint-Martin-en-Campagne, north-east of Dieppe. From the water, it is hard to miss the Penly nuclear power station just 700 metres up the coast at the foot of the chalk cliffs, sucking in seawater to cool its two reactors, then pumping it back out to sea a few degrees warmer. But ignore it she does. Reports of incidents do not deter the teacher from her daily swim. “Questions are quickly stifled here. Where there is a nuclear industry, it’s a non-subject. It is hidden behind the cliff and we don’t talk about it,” she says.</p><p>Like many villages and towns in close proximity to France’s nuclear plants, St Martin-en-Campagne in the Petit-Caux district is close enough that it could be evacuated in case of an accident.
