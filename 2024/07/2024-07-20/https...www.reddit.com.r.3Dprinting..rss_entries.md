<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>It just works! and fast too!!</p> <p>The Ender3 v2 was my first 3d printer and it was really frustrating to try to get to work - I watched videos, followed guides, added a CR Touch and replaced the springs, spent hours on it, but still couldn't get it to print reliably and consistently. My lack of knowledge was probably a big part, but I was just about ready to quit. </p> <p>Until I saw that a guy from work is selling his almost new A1 mini (60 hours of total print time), so I bought it from him. Today I printed with it for the first time and the differences are... just wow! It worked perfectly from the start, no tinkering, no frustration. just send the file to the printer and it prints it. that's it. Idiot proof.</p> <p>Now I have a lot of catching on to do, with all the models I downloaded and never got to print. See you guys in a month! ;)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/-YmymY-"> /u/-YmymY- </
