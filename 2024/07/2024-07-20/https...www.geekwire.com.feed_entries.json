That number amounts to less than 1 percent of all Windows machines, according to the company. But despite the relatively small percentage, &#8220;the broad economic and societal impacts reflect the use of CrowdStrike by enterprises that run many critical services,&#8221; Microsoft said in its post. CrowdStrike previously\u00a0outlined a fix for the issue, which involves booting Windows machines in safe mode and deleting the file associated with the faulty update.

Our guest is Erik Moore, a veteran of the cybersecurity field and program director for the online Master of Science Program in Cybersecurity Leadership at Seattle University&#8217;s Albers School of Business and Economics. Moore says cybersecurity companies are facing fast-moving and complex threats due to factors including AI, and geopolitical and financial forces, requiring rapid responses. Current testing and deployment processes need to be overhauled to handle these new challenges&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2024/beyond-the-crowdstrike-outage-the-larger-forces-at-play-and-a-long-term-view-on-cybersecurity/\">Read Mo", "id": 900422, "language": "en-US", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2024/beyond-the-crowdstrike-outage-the-larger-forces-at-play-and-a-long-term-view-on-cybersecurity", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 29, "page_rating_contents": 90, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed", "source_obj__id": 131, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Beyond the CrowdStrike outage: The larger forces at play, and a long-term view on cybersecurity", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
