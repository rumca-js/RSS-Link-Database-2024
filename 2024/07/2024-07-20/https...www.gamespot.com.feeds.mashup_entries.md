<p dir="ltr">Today, during Tennocon 2024, Digital Extremes debuted a new gameplay trailer for Warframe: 1999, a narrative-driven spin-off quest for Warframe set in the late 1990s. Along with some tubular action sequences, the trailer showed off a new boss fight where the most dangerous enemy might be the earworm that infects your real-world brain during the battle.</p><p dir="ltr">The trailer kicks off in a deserted shopping mall, complete with old, clunky computers and an arcade lined with machines. A team of Protoframes, led by the main character Arthur, then pursue Dr. Entrati, who Warframe fans know as the first person to make contact with the Void that gives the Tenno their power.</p><figure style="width: 3840px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4336697-1999_screenshot_infestedband.jpg"><img alt="What backstreets are these boys from?" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4336697-1999_screenshot_infestedband.jpg" /></a><figcaption>W
