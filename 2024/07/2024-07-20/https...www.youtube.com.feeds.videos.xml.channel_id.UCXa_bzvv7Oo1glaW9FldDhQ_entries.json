Indeed, we\u2019ve focused on ray tracing in no less than three previous videos, but it\u2019s worth revisiting again as the fruits of ray tracing\u2019s promise continue to bloom as developers better get to grips with the tech. \n\nIt\u2019s moved beyond an industry buzzword now; games harnessing the benefits of real-time lighting, shadows, reflections, and all that sparkly good stuff ray tracing affords all look superb. \n\nThe only caveats \u2013 and these are things that have existed for as long as the tech has been around \u2013 are the drops in frame rate performance. Ray tracing capable GPUs continue to come at huge expense too, although the ever-present perception that all ray tracing does is make things shiny is dying down now. When analysing their graphics only, the games in this video look fantastic thanks to ray tracing.\n\nLinks to previous parts:\n\nPart 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNSpiret-9g\n\nPart 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIf-hI5-n7Y\n\nPart 3: https://www.youtube.com/", "id": 900518, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZXvc1weVNM", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "source_obj__id": 129, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/PZXvc1weVNM/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "10 More Games That Look GRAPHICALLY STUNNING Due To Ray Tracing [4K]", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-07-20T13:30:07+00:00", "description": "", "id": 899795, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IB7xtUOUO68", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 26, "page_rating_contents": 82, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "source_obj__id": 129, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/IB7xtUOUO68/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "This OLD SCHOOL RESIDENT EVIL Inspired Game Is A Must Play For Horror Fans", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-07-20T06:30:09+00:00", "description": "Check out this week's biggest gaming stories featuring PS5 Pro, The Witcher 4, EA Sports FC 25, Unknown 9 Awakening and The Precinct.", "id": 898722, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDJSPHjks0U", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "source_obj__id": 129, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/UDJSPHjks0U/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "PS5 PRO RELEASE THIS SEPTEMBER?
