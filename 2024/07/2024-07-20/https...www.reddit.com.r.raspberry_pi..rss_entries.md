<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all, thanks for taking the time to read this.</p> <p>I am attempting to use Android on my RPi 5 with the official 7&quot; touch screen display.</p> <p>A couple points to note:</p> <ul> <li>The Touchscreen display works perfectly with any other OS (Ubuntu, Manjaro, PiOS)</li> <li>I can load android and connect to an external standard monitor.</li> </ul> <p>I have attempted to use Android by Emtera, KonstaKang (AOSP14 &amp; Lineage). I have also gone into the settings and turned on the 'Touch Screen Display' setting within the Android OS, however I cannot for the life of me get it to reboot with the touch screen display.</p> <p>With Lineage, I was able to get it to boot momentarily and display the lineage logo, however the screen went dark afterwards.</p> <p>I have also played around with the config.txt on the boot drive to attempt to boot it with the specific resolution and to use the touch screen display.</p> <p>Any help would be greatly appreciate

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I just started doing some remote Raspberry Pi development with Python via VS Code on my Macbook, using the ssh extension. I'd love to hear about your tips, tricks, tools and workflows for similar remote development. What have you figured out about making it all work smoothly that others should know? </p> <p>For example, how do you handle version control? How would you clone the code from one Pi to another? Is VS Code via ssh enough tooling for you or do you find the need to use something else, like maybe VNC (and if so what tools do you use)?</p> <p>But those are just examples. I've gotten to Level 1, writing and running code remotely; what's your advice for the next level? </p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/TheRealRoderick"> /u/TheRealRoderick </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1e7jj5f/what_are_your_tips_tricks_and_tools_for_remote/">[link]</a><
