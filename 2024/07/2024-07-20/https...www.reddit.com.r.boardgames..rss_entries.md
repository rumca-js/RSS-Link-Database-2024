<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Assassinorum: Execution Force</p> <p>This stealth game is one of very very few Warhammer 40k cooperative games. GW miniatures are, of course, gorgeous. Game itself... not so gorgeous.</p> <p>Players are assassins trying to eliminate Lord of chaos. Gameplay is simple: you are supposed to avoid or quickly eliminate patrols of cultists and chaos space marines so that they do not raise the alarm, and at the same time search rooms for key items neccessary to get to the boss. Combat is fast and deadly. Assassins easily kill enemies, but they are also fragile, so you need to be careful. Of course, every character has several special abilities, but they have limited number of uses, and there are a lot of enemies. </p> <p>Overall gameplay feels thematic; there is definitely an atmosphere of stealthy infiltration. Also sessions are fast, and there is almost no fiddling with the components. It could be a great game, but for two huge flaws. </p> <p>1) high price.

The sense of the timer ticking down, having to be careful and deliberate when stacking the dice, the frustration when a die doesn't fit... it was so interesting!</p> <p>I'm curious if you guys have experiences with other mechanics being implemented in evocative ways that helped you really connect with the theme of a game, or made you feel like you were really doing the thing the game was about?
