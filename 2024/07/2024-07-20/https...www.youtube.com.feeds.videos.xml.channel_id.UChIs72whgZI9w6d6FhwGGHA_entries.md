We don't know what the cause of failure is yet. We've received a lot of leaks and credible tips and, working alongside Wendell of Level1 Techs, we have been trying to get to the bottom of Intel's CPU failures. The current trouble is how reviewers should even test these parts for the upcoming AMD Zen 5 reviews though, as any changes from Intel will need to be reflected in that comparative data. Likewise, until Intel puts out a better statement, we simply do not feel comfortable recommending 13th and 14th Gen CPUs while this matter is pending. This video talks about tips we've received relating to oxidation or potential corrosion within the silicon, specifically relating to the vias, and other tips like excessive voltage, memory speeds, unstable frequency, and failure rates. This is not a complete investigation. We are still working and do not yet have a conclusion, nor do we have full confidence in any one failure mode.
