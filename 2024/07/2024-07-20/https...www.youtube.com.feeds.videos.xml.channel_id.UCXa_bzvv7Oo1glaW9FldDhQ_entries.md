Ray tracing isn’t new. Indeed, we’ve focused on ray tracing in no less than three previous videos, but it’s worth revisiting again as the fruits of ray tracing’s promise continue to bloom as developers better get to grips with the tech. 

It’s moved beyond an industry buzzword now; games harnessing the benefits of real-time lighting, shadows, reflections, and all that sparkly good stuff ray tracing affords all look superb. 

The only caveats – and these are things that have existed for as long as the tech has been around – are the drops in frame rate performance. Ray tracing capable GPUs continue to come at huge expense too, although the ever-present perception that all ray tracing does is make things shiny is dying down now. When analysing their graphics only, the games in this video look fantastic thanks to ray tracing.
