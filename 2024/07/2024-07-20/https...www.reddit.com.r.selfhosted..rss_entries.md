<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am designing a self hosted dashboard named mDash that can automatically discover other services you have running on your network. It will scan all IPs on your local network for ports that other self hosted services run. For example, Home Assistantâ€™s port is 8123, so it will try to connect to all IPs on your local network with the port 8123 and see if it exists or not, then add it to your dashboard. I was wondering if there were any services you would like me to add and what default ports they have so I can add it to the array to scan for. Also, if there is any other features you would like added to the dashboard, feel free to comment.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/lowercase-raging"> /u/lowercase-raging </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1e87k4k/new_self_hosted_dashboard_ideas/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comme

After final culling/selection we end up with tens of photos, and I take the remaining files and upload to a shared cloud storage, which has not a lot of space available. My wish would be to be able to place the many JPEGs on some network storage on the local network, which is very fast, and let her use a mobile app or browser to review the photos on her own. I'd like for it to be snappy and of course she needs to be able to delete individual images in a slideshare fashion without too much hassle (clicking three times etc). My initial research brought me to NextCloud + Memory app, but maybe there are better alternatives. Could you help?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>TLDR: I can connect but not log into the Jellyfin and AudioBookShelf Apps on my Pixel 6a while it works via the browser and other devices.</p> <p>Recently I set up AudioBookShelf on my UnRaid server and now wanted to log into the corresponding app on a Pixel 6a. Choosing the server over IP address worked fine but when entering the credentials it just didn't worked so I tried log in into the web interface which worked fine.<br /> Suspecting an issue with AudioBookShelf itself, I tried another android phone which worked flawlessly with the same account.<br /> Next I tried to log into the Jellyfin app which also didn't worked and now, having it basically isolated to this single device, I'm out of ideas on what could cause this issue.<br /> Does anyone of you have an idea or similar issue?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I tried my best to avoid making another thread about this, but I've tried everything I can. I run game servers from my Windows PC, but cannot anymore because I moved and am now stuck with Zito's CGN IP address. I purchased an Ubuntu VPS from Ionos as a public &quot;gateway&quot; (Reddit told me it's better than paying for a static IP), and installed Wireguard on it and my PC. I've tried DOZENS of guides including with Tailscale (closest I got to working), but haven't got any of them to work. The following steps are my latest (ChatGPT assisted) attempt at making it work, some commands are probably redundant because I don't fully understand what all they do. Pings between the two do not work, and the Ark (game) server launches LAN only, though it still can access the internet, and still shows its own CGN IP online.</p> <ol> <li>apt-update/upgrade</li> <li>ufw allow OpenSSH</li> <li>ufw enable</li> <li>/etc/ssh/sshd_config <ul> <li>LoginGraceTime 2m</li>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello everyone,</p> <p>Iâ€™m looking for some advice on improving remote access speeds to my Synology NAS 220+. Itâ€™s set up at my home, and Iâ€™m trying to connect to it from outside with good speed. However, I donâ€™t have a static IP, so direct connection isnâ€™t an option. Iâ€™ve explored several solutions to address this, but Iâ€™m hitting some roadblocks. Hereâ€™s what Iâ€™ve tried:</p> <ol> <li>ZeroTier: This is my favorite so far. It provides decent performance and has been reliable over time. However, the speed Iâ€™m getting is quite low, around 300-600 KB/s, sometimes peaking at 1 MB/s. This is frustrating given my home connection is 100 Mbps up and down.</li> <li>Tailscale: Similar story here. Easy to set up, but the speed is again quite disappointing, hovering around the same 300-600 KB/s mark.</li> <li>CloudFlare: This one stands out. Somehow, CloudFrame manages to deliver speeds up to 10 Mbps, sometimes even hitting 18-20 Mbps, which is fantastic. The majo
