<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello, while looking for boards for my IoT I came across the world of RISC-V boards which seems to be what I'm looking for. Are there boards that don't consume too much power (because they're battery-powered) that can shoot 1080p@30fps video with a ~5MB sensor (with WIFI)?</p> <p>I found these boards here:</p> <ul> <li>Milk-V DUO S (but Ethernet port which is not needed)</li> <li>Luckfox PICO mini B: it seems to meet my requirements but no wifi</li> </ul> <p>Are there any other WIFI boards out there (not necessary RISC-V) ?</p> <p>Thank you :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/BDFE-Cdte"> /u/BDFE-Cdte </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1e7z2tg/riscv_camera_board/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1e7z2tg/riscv_camera_board/">[comments]</a></span>
