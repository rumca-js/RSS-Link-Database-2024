<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi All, apologies in advance if this topic had been covered before, but my brother and I (both in our 40s) brought down the old Amiga from the loft last week to have one of our irregular trips down memory lane, only to find our beloved machine would not load a single disk. </p> <p>The regular drive inside the computer grinds 3 times if any disk is inserted, then refuses to go any further. The external floppy drive makes a continuous grinding noise if a disk is inserted, which doesn't cease until it is removed. The curious thing about this is that the grinding noise is made when the drive is plugged in but it does it either if it is switched on or is switched off. I therefore suspect it may be some sort of mechanical issue rather than a disk reading issue, but I took it apart and had a look under the hood and couldn't find any faults in the mechanisms.</p> <p>This very evening I ran a recently purchased head cleaning disk through them both (dry and the

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>As title says. I recenlty started to look at Amiga (grew up with Dos) and I'm pretty amazed by it. Theres a ton of fantastic looking games, but there seem to be several ways go play them. And I'm specificfally talking emulation here.</p> <p>I've tried running adf files in WinUAE. This seems to work quite well, but it comes with the slower boot times.</p> <p>Also tried a pack of hdf files that Retroarch PUAE core can run, they boot almost instantly, but some games seem to have issues. For example F-18 interceptor hangs and doesn't seem to work smoothly. I wonder if there could be some settings to tweak or if its a very isolated case.</p> <p>I've also seen Game Selector, which seems like a super convinient way, but you have to download a pretty big pack...</p> <p>So, what's your prefered way? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/coopykins"> /u/coopykins </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/
