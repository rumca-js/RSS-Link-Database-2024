<p>After five and a half weeks of pre-election idiocy, the Tories’ finale is to show off the leader even they thought was a disaster</p><p>Cast your mind back to 22 May. You probably wondered not just why Rishi Sunak had called an election at all, but why he had chosen a six-week campaign. It wasn’t as if he had anything new to say in that time. The economy wasn’t suddenly going to make a miraculous recovery. Hundreds of refugees weren’t going to volunteer to fly themselves to Rwanda. Patients weren’t about to take themselves off hospital waiting lists.</p><p>Rish! told us he had a plan. And it’s turned out he knew exactly what he was doing. Six weeks was what it would take. Six weeks was the perfect number. Six weeks is what it would take for the Tories to lose their minds completely.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jul/02/johnson-appears-on-campaign-trail-at-last-to-dance-on-sunaks-grave">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A tie that had promised noise, tempo and a rattling intensity delivered emphatically. At its conclusion Turkey’s substitutes and staff could hurtle on to the pitch in celebration of a quarter-final spot, their colleagues having seen out wave after wave of Austria pressure that did not yield a leveller. They will face the Netherlands in Berlin after seeing out a game they led for all bar the first 57 seconds, the centre-back Merih Demiral scoring the second-fastest goal in European Championship history and adding another in the second half. Despite a response from Michael Gregoritsch and a frantic finale that brought heroics from the Turkey keeper Mert Gunok, there was to be disappointment for Ralf Rangnick’s highly fancied team.</p><p>The smart money had been on an early goal; the surprise was that it came from Turkey. They had been well warned about Austria’s propensity to score inside the first 10 minutes and, when Rangnick’s side poured forward from kick-off, it seemed reasonabl

For their opponents, this still counts as a good tournament, and their fans made one heck of a noise. But the gulf in class between Romania and the Oranje in blue was clear and only grew larger as the game went on.

<p>Fly-half admits he is not the finished article, but he gets his chance to shine in the first Test against the All Blacks on Saturday</p><p>It is almost seven years since Eddie Jones first invited an 18-year-old Marcus Smith to attend an England training camp in Oxford. “Some people have an apprenticeship for a year, some for 30 years,” Jones said at the time. “We don’t know with him. Talent gets you into a squad but hard work and desire gets you into the team.”</p><p>That distant quote resonated afresh as Smith, now 25, sits in England’s team hotel explaining his&nbsp;intense desire to make the most of the first Test against the All&nbsp;Blacks in Dunedin on Saturday. The fly‑half will be winning his 34th cap but in some ways this is the day for which he has really been waiting. To be master of his own destiny at No&nbsp;10 in one of the world’s most challenging rugby environments is&nbsp;everything Jones’s boy wonder ever dreamed.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/art

The way Mario’s cowardly brother nervously hums along to the music as he bumbles through spooky stately homes. The slapstick animations when he falls through a fireplace or gets catapulted into a secret room by a fold-down bed. The cackles and goofy expressions of the ghosts as they get up to their hijinks. As you use Luigi’s trusty ghost-capturing vacuum cleaner to pull back rugs and expose secret trapdoors (or secret spiders), and suck up the banknotes and golden coins that are hidden everywhere, you can’t help but notice how each little sound, scene and secret has been carefully arranged to give you a small dose of delight.</p><p>This ghost-busting puzzle game was such a delightful surprise sequel in 2013 when it was released for th

But if anyone does, let us know if it works.” “It’s solid-gold advice that we’re giving,” adds Gorton. “We should be charging for it.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/article/2024/jul/02/you-stole-95k-in-front-of-the-whole-nation-the-reality-tv-villains-celebrating-ludicrous-crim

Robin Williams’ outstanding performance, Ben Affleck’s petty squabbling with his on-screen and actual brother, the fact that Affleck and Matt Damon’s Oscar-winning screenplay is actually (a little bit) autobiographical – both hailing from Massachusetts, Affleck’s father was a janitor at Harvard, while his mother went to the university, as did Damon, before dropping out. The film is a great watch, a classic and pleasing arc of self-discovery, with a happy-ish ending that avoids the pitfall of being too twee. The protagonist (Will, played by Damon) is a complete eejit – sucker-punching people, fighting police, insulting his mentor’s dead wife, ignoring the time and energy of others while taking his seemingly god-given talent for granted – but we end up rooting for him any

That was in 2019. I haven’t stopped thinking about the painting since. So the fact that the Dominican Republic-born, New York-based artist is finally opening her first solo show in the UK is thrilling.</p><p>Titled Sueño de la Madrugada (A Midnight’s Dream) (although madrugada actually translates as dawn in English), the exhibition offers clouds of small paintings offset from the wall, murals that wrap rooms, painted aluminium cutouts and an immersive in

Will each young chef be able to obliterate their father’s career and come out on top? </p><p>This month, CBBC will debut Cooking Buddies, in which young viewers will be taught to make such varied dishes as spicy tomato pasta and fish finger sandwiches. Taken at face value, this sounds like a tremendous idea. A cookery show for kids has the potential to hit all the classic BBC criteria – it will be fun and educational and hints at a happy future in which I won’t be the one who cooks dinner for my family every day until I die.</p><p>However, there is a rub. Cooking Buddies will be presented by Buddy Oliver, Jamie Oliver’s 13-year-old son.

But it’s so quiet out here. And all I can hear is my brain.” New Zealand hiker Ian (Thomas Sainsbury) isn’t so much a worrywart as a one-man anxiety epidemic. Out trekking solo in the forest to get away from a divorce, everything is a source of torment to this clammy-browed sadsack: his blisters, the possibility of encountering other hikers, but especially the lingering possibility something is lurking in the darkness behind him at the path’s vanishing point. Luckily, fellow wayfarer Nicky (Hayden J Weal) takes Ian under his wing.</p><p>It’s not clear if loquacious Nicky, a glucose shot in human form, is a boon companion or a further ordeal for Ian. Ditto loved-up Aussies Monica (Kate Simmonds) and Austin (Tawanda Manyimo), whom they run into at a refuge after Ian dodged them earlier down the trail.

<p>This rich fourth collection by James Womack ponders the fraught relationship between place and dweller – and our craving for connection</p><p>James Womack’s latest collection sees the city as both muse and antagonist. A frustrated energy merges with sentiment in poems that feel like a last hurrah to living as we know it. “The city is dead, and yes, the country too, / and probably, beyond, the grey wide world,” he declares in Seasons. Womack, the author of three previous books of poetry, wrote this collection in the shadow of climate crisis and the pandemic, which is why it oozes with anguish. But there’s a quietness, too — a sense of acceptance so the poems never blare.</p><p>The opener is an epic titled The City, an Argument and sets the tone for an ongoing fraught relationship between place and dweller. The narrator makes bold proclamations that bounce between banal and menacing. “Beloved, the city wakes up after the weekend… / Beloved, the city eats and shits its citizens.” It’s

They are full of best-case scenarios, undetailed proposals and dubious costings, and it is hard to picture the impact each party would have on the UK if they followed through with their pitches. So I’ve been feeding party literature into the political strategy video game Democracy 4, to see how these policies might play out.
