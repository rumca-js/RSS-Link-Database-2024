								<p>There are 16 core <strong>DnD languages</strong> in fifth edition. While every Dungeons and Dragons character can speak to each other in Common, they may also know other <strong>D&amp;D languages</strong> thanks to their background. This guide explains all languages in DnD (including the rarest ones), and it can help you decide which are worth your character learning.</p>
