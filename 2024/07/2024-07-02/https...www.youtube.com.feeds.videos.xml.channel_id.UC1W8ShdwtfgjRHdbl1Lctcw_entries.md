I colorized , restored and I added a sky visual effect and created a sound design for this video of Vancouver, Canada 1920s, shows the city before the Second World War, with public transport and cars on streets full of pedestrians and cyclists. Other views of Vancouver's nature And these forests and the other And these forests and the lake, Then we have magnificent scenes at the beach,

Video Restoration Process:
âœ” FPS boosted to 60 frames per second 
âœ” Image resolution boosted up to HD 
âœ” Improved video sharpness and brightness 
âœ” Colorized only for the ambiance (not historically accurate)
âœ”sound design added only for the ambiance
âœ”restoration:(stabilisation,denoise,cleand,deblur) 

Please, be aware that colorization colors are not real and fake, colorization was made only for the ambiance and do not represent real historical data.
