<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello everyone,</p> <p>I’m currently working on a project where I need to integrate a Telegram bot with Open WebUI. I’m relatively new to this and could use some guidance on how to proceed. I have already set up Open WebUI + Ollama in Docker and exposed it with a reverse proxy and it works great. I managed to create the bot and have the token. How can I establish communication between the Telegram bot and Open WebUI?</p> <p>Has anyone here done something similar? Any advice, tutorials, or code examples would be greatly appreciated.</p> <p>Thank you in advance.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Vinsens33"> /u/Vinsens33 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1dtys4l/how_to_connect_telegram_bot_to_open_webui/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1dtys4l/how_to_connect_telegram_bot_to_open_webui/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi guys, I'm speaking from the bottom of my heart right now. I just feel empty inside. A mixture of deep hatred and sadness. </p> <p>I've spent the last few days with several smartphones as I wanted to make a switch from a Samsung Galaxy S21FE to an S24+. Everything was already there, except for the last step, WhatsApp. Getting the chats over was already a cramp and went very badly. But after the whole thing was done, the shock came. When I looked in the gallery of the new smartphone, I saw photos from 2020 in the WhatsApp Images folder. The folder had been replaced by an ancient backup of Samsung's gallery. This completely stupid OneDrive Sync function, which still contained photos from back then.</p> <p>I thought, never mind, just copy them from the old phone again. But the WhatsApp images, videos etc. were all deleted there! Everything is gone. What triggers something like this if I move the number to another cell phone? That's worse than any Troja

The app allows to work cross streaming service, which Jellyseer and Overseer don't do + it has some nice features where you can pick movies you want to watch with friends. This is something I would look for, but is there any alternative to this besides Jellyseerr/Overseerr?

I'm especially concerned about noise, I don't want an old demon ranting and venting in the night behind the tv.
