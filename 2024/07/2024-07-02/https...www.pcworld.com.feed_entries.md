<p>Sign-in functions for Microsoft&rsquo;s Xbox Live service failed Tuesday into the afternoon, preventing users from signing in to and playing Xbox games on the console and PC.</p>

<p>Amazon apparently didn&rsquo;t get the memo that the metaverse is dead. I mean, how else do you explain its <a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=111346X1569483&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/beyond?hm_store_id=QZwkhNACkaP&amp;xcust=2-1-2384178-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">new 3D &ldquo;Gaming Zone&rdquo; showroom</a> that looks like what the 1980s thought the future would be?</p>



<p>The Gaming Zone features the tag &ldquo;beyond&rdquo; as part of its URL, implying that this is something new or revolutionary. It&rsquo;s really not.</p>



<p>Instead of organizing games as a series of links on the page, this unnecessarily retro Amazon storefront simply arranges them as 3D objects in a virtual space that you can navigate around.</p>

<p>Copilot AI is the future of computing&mdash;at least, that&rsquo;s what Microsoft would like you to believe. They went so far as to stick the name on both <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2374439/surface-pro-2024-review.html">their own new Surface PCs</a> and other manufacturers&rsquo; laptops.</p>



<p>So, why is it that it took them months and months to get the thing working on Windows 10 PCs with more than one monitor?</p>



<p>Yeah, Copilot on Windows 10 is weird. Chalk it up to the way Microsoft has been <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2302230/a-windows-11-free-upgrade-pushes-a-pc-a-user-will-have-to-buy.html">aggressively trying to get people off of Windows 10</a> and onto Windows 11, perhaps.

<p>If your Google Drive storage is reaching its limits, you&rsquo;ll need to clear out old and unused files to free up space. But what if you&rsquo;ve already deleted files and your Google Drive capacity is still just as full?</p>



<p>Here&rsquo;s what you need to know about why this happens and what you can do to fix the problem.</p>

<p>It can be puzzling when you remove files from Google Drive and see that your storage capacity isn&rsquo;t affected. The reason for this is simpler than you might think: &ldquo;deleted&rdquo; files are actually just moved to Trash, where they continue to take up storage space.</p>

The Austrian company revised its dual-fan NH-D15 design with a collection of engineering improvements that make it quieter, stronger, and even better at air cooling.</p>



<p>The NH-D15 G2 has a lot of subtle design improvements, starting with offset, asymmetrical fin stacks above eight separate heat pipes. These redesigned hunks of metal now offer 20 percent more surface area for cooling via dual 140mm fans, plus a more smoothed-out acoustic profile.</p>



<p>According to Noctua&rsquo;s promotional video, the cooler is approximately 20 percent better at dissipating heat load at 60 degrees Cel

<p>The Startup page in Windows 11&rsquo;s Settings is really useful for toggling which apps auto-start when you boot the system.</p>



<p>But the more apps you have enabled in Startup, the longer it takes for Windows to be fully usable after restarting. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s good to check the Startup page every so often and disable unwanted apps.</p>



<p>Or you could simply enable a built-in notification that alerts you whenever new apps are added to Startup. Here&rsquo;s how to configure Windows to notify you when new Startup apps appear.</p>

<p>It might be surprising, but free VPNs are no longer just for PCs. You can also use them to help easily boost your security and privacy game on an Android device. Whether you want extra security while using a public Wi-Fi network, or to get around geo-restrictions for your favorite streaming services, a free VPN can help you do it without having to pay a cent.</p>



<p>The problem when looking for a good free VPN, though, is that there are a large number of them available on the Google Play Store and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2361057/privacy-issues-with-top-android-vpns-puts-2-5-billion-users-at-risk.html">most aren&rsquo;t trustworthy</a>.

<p>Just a little over a week ago, the US government announced <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2374136/use-kaspersky-antivirus-software-the-government-plans-to-ban-it.html">a ban of Kaspersky antivirus software</a>&mdash;which will soon leave its remaining users without a functional program. Starting July 20, Kaspersky must discontinue sale to new customers and entering third-party partnerships, and on September 29, virus definitions, app updates, and operation of the Kaspersky Security Network cease (as do reselling, integrations, and licensing).</p>



<p>If you&rsquo;re still using Kaspersky, you can use the software without legal penalty, but getting onto an alternative before your virus definitions go out of date is paramount. You don&rsquo;t want to leave your PC vulnerable.</p>

<p>Since Microsoft moved from selling Office as a software package for Windows and Mac to selling subscriptions to Microsoft 365, the company has added a range of additional programs and services to the package. Some are old-fashioned desktop applications, some are web apps, and some are pure services or add-ons.</p>



<p>In this article, I&rsquo;ll walk you through OneDrive, OneNote, and Clipchamp, showing you what they can do for you and how to use them as part of your Microsoft 365 subscription. I&rsquo;ll also cover Microsoft&rsquo;s library of stock images of all kinds, which are now part of the classic Office programs and make it easy to spice up documents with ready-made photos, illustrations, icons and more.</p>
