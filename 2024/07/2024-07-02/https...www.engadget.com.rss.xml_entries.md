<p>The latest title to join the Netflix Games roster is a very modern take on one of the icons of Windows computing. That's right, you can now play <em>Minesweeper</em> through Netflix's app. The classic PC puzzle game has been reimagined with an international setting, tasking the player with very literally looking for underwater mines by overlaying the usual interface of numbers and flags over vibrant pictures of waterways from around the world.</p>
<p>For those of us who grew up playing the original game, this take from Netflix is certainly a departure in appearance. Colorful aquatic backgrounds? A journey mode? Buh? However, the Netflix version does have one definite bonus that the trailer calls out at its close: &quot;No in-game ads. No extra fees. No in-app purchases.&quot; Trying to find a modern-day <em>Minesweeper</em> game for mobile involves sifting through what feels like countless options that mimic the look of the original

<p>A three-mile stretch of Interstate 94 in Michigan will be converted into America’s first smart highway.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/07/02/smart-highway-i-94-michigan"><em>Axios</em></a> reports that the Alphabet-backed startup Cavnue has started constructing the smart highway as part of a new pilot project that could spur other construction projects across the country. Two more highways are in the works for Austin, Texas and somewhere else in the Southwest, according to <a href="https://www.cavnue.com/">Cavnue’s website</a>.</p>

<p>Meta is changing a long-running policy regarding the Arabic word “shaheed,” which has been described as the most-moderated word on the company’s apps. The company said in <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://transparency.meta.com/en-gb/oversight/oversight-board-cases/shaheed-pao"><ins>an update</ins></a> to the Oversight Board that use of the word alone would no longer result in a post’s removal.</p>

<p>Two state laws from Texas and Florida, that could upend the way social media companies handle content moderation are still up in the air. The Supreme Court <a href="https://www.engadget.com/supreme-court-remands-social-media-moderation-cases-over-first-amendment-issues-154001257.html">sent the challenges back to lower courts</a>, which vacates previous rulings. In a 9 - 0 decision in Moody v. NetChoice and NetChoice v. Paxton, the Supreme Court said that earlier rulings in lower courts had not properly evaluated the laws’ impact on the First Amendment. Never heard of NetChoice? It’s an industry group representing Meta, Google, X and other large tech companies. So it’s incredibly well-funded. NetChoice argued that the laws were unconstitutional.</p>
