But accessing that expertise at the right time isn&#8217;t always an efficient process. That&#8217;s where a startup called PairUp wants to help, with software designed to streamline how knowledge is stored and shared across a company. PairUp provides quick answers to questions about documents and projects. It can help find colleagues who have experience working with a particular customer or expertise with a certain software tool. It&#8217;s also pitched as a way to help new workers access knowledge \u2014 especially from employees who&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2024/this-startup-wants-to-help-change-the-way-knowledge-is-captured-and-accessed-at-companies/\">Read More</a>", "id": 807796, "language": "en-US", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2024/this-startup-wants-to-help-change-the-way-knowledge-is-captured-and-accessed-at-companies", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 29, "page_rating_contents": 90, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed", "source_obj__id": 131, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "This startup wants to help change the way knowledge is captured and accessed at companies", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-07-02T17:22:47+00:00", "description": "<img alt=\"Proposed AAMMC facility in Spokane\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"709\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Facility-AAMMC-1260x709.jpg\" width=\"1260\" /><br />The U.S. Department of Commerce&#8217;s Economic Development Administration today awarded $504 million in grants to 12 regional Tech Hubs across the country, but Spokane&#8217;s Tech Hub for developing advanced aerospace materials missed out.

The deal also includes an investment by the airline of an undisclosed sum. According to Axios, the engines will be used in the airline&#8217;s Bombardier CRJ700 jets, a 65-seat aircraft that&#8217;s used for regional flights. American has 140 of the jets in its fleet. ZeroAvia announced in April that it would be selling components of its hydrogen fuel cell-powered airplane engines to other commercial companies.

Cole recently retired as CEO of Blink, the Seattle-based UX and design shop that she co-founded 24 years ago. When the startup launched in 2000, the internet was in its infancy. One of Blink&#8217;s early projects was designing the first courts electronic file and serve system for LexisNexis. Before then, lawyers were walking their documents to the courthouse. Digitizing these operations, Cole said, &#8220;was revolutionary.&#8221; Blink grew slowly for many years. The startup never took investment dollars and rejected acquisition offers.
