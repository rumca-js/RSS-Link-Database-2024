		The <a href="https://www.meity.gov.in/sites/upload_files/dit/files/Digital%20India.pdf">Digital India</a> program has overhauled the country’s digital public infrastructure (DPI), according to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who praised the initiative's success across domains. Digital India launched nine years ago, on July 1, 2015, with the aim of transforming India into a digital society.

“A Digital India is an empowered India, boosting 'Ease of Living' and transparency. This thread gives a glimpse of the strides made in a decade thanks to the effective usage of technology,” says Modi, sharing a thread on <a href="https://x.com/narendramodi/status/1807687344281223592">X</a>.

		European Union countries are in the process of introducing their digital identities as part of the bloc’s plan to introduce the EU Digital Identity (EUDI) Wallet. A team of researchers has proposed an identification model based on face biometrics and electronic national identity (eID) cards.

In a <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1999-5903/16/7/228">paper</a> published in the Future Internet journal, researchers from the University of Sassari in Italy examine the impact of biometric-based digital identity and its use in everyday applications.

		Through its network of partners, the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) has been making the case for Civil Registration and Vital Statistics (CRVS) and digital public infrastructure (DPI) ecosystems to be integrated.

The UN agency believes doing this will give more meaning to digital transformation efforts and increase the chances of people accessing public services using legal identification, especially as many more countries are undertaking digital ID and DPI projects.

		Online gambling has been rising in popularity thanks to its convenience but fraudsters and scammers are also finding their way into the business. From money laundering to payment system fraud all the way to bonus abuse, or manipulating promotion incentives, criminals are finding novel ways to exploit iGaming platforms – which at the same time are facing regulatory pressures to verify their players.

One of the emerging trends in defrauding online gambling platforms is colluding between players to launder money, especially those in organized crime, says Eleni Panagiotopoulou, head of anti-money laundering (AML) at gambling software company <a href="https://www.softswiss.com/">Softswiss</a>.

		The commitment by Togo and Kazakhstan to support each other in the development of their digital public infrastructure (DPI) projects has seen a boost with the signing of three licensing agreements.

These agreements were signed recently in the Togolese capital Lome in the course of a working visit paid to the country by a delegation from Kazakhstan’s National Information Technologies agency (NITEC).

The deal was signed by the heads of NITEC and the Togo Digital Agency (ATD), according to an announcement by the <a href="https://numerique.gouv.tg/">Ministry of Digital Economy and Transformation</a>.

		Beneficiaries of government subsidies in the Philippines may need to show their national ID before having access to such benefits in the future if a new plan goes ahead.

The plan was discussed during a recent meeting between the Economic Development Group (EDG) and the Inter-Agency Committee on Inflation and Market Outlook (IAC-IMO), as mentioned in a <a href="https://web.facebook.com/share/p/URrKRwwwPYbdmfmU/">Facebook post</a> of the Department of Finance.

According to the post, the government is “considering the use of the Philippine Identification System (Philsys) as a registration and validation system for more efficient distribution of subsidies.” This means that should the plan be eventually made official, the physical or digital version of the national

		In <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>, the Tazkira has been a key identity document providing proof of nationality and residence for over 100 years. This traditional paper-based document system has changed significantly, reflecting the country’s move toward modernization. Afghan National ID Tazkira currently known as <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/e-tazkira">e-Tazkira</a> was launched in May 2018 under President Ashraf Ghani’s administration. This change aimed to increase security and facilitate access to essential digital services.
