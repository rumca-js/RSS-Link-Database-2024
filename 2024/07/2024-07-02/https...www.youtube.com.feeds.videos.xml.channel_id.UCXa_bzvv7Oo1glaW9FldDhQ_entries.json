Nevertheless, it happened, but recent titles have shown an uptick in quality. Among these, Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble is perhaps the best.\n\nDespite the almost non-existent storyline, Adventure Mode goes back to what it's all about - stage after stage of tense platforming and banana collecting. Despite their length, Banana Rumble's 200 stages feel unique, with interesting hooks and memorable aesthetics. \n\nWhether Super Monkey Ball died after the launch of Deluxe or you're seeking a compelling arcade platformer, Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble is worth checking out. The franchise still has a ways to go, but it's still a fun time.", "id": 807880, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMyu4XVTbHY", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "source_obj__id": 129, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/dMyu4XVTbHY/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble Review - The Final Verdict", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-07-02T15:30:11+00:00", "description": "Once Human seems to be another trendy multiplayer survival game on the surface, but it\u2019s shaping to be far more than that.
