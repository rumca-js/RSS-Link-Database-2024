Sega's Super Monkey Ball series is over two decades old and given how critically acclaimed the first three entries were, a prolonged decline of any kind would be unimaginable. Nevertheless, it happened, but recent titles have shown an uptick in quality. Among these, Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble is perhaps the best.

Despite the almost non-existent storyline, Adventure Mode goes back to what it's all about - stage after stage of tense platforming and banana collecting. Despite their length, Banana Rumble's 200 stages feel unique, with interesting hooks and memorable aesthetics. 

Whether Super Monkey Ball died after the launch of Deluxe or you're seeking a compelling arcade platformer, Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble is worth checking out. The franchise still has a ways to go, but it's still a fun time.

Once Human seems to be another trendy multiplayer survival game on the surface, but it’s shaping to be far more than that. The horror element that permeates everything in Once Human is decidedly different than any other survival game on the market today.

Of course, you can completely ignore the campaign and just focus on creating buildings or rising in the PvP leaderboards; the game lets you play it your way. Once Human has many promising systems, so here’s our list of 15 things you need to know before you buy Once Human.
