The setup went smoothly, and everything seemed fine initially. However, I've hit a snag when trying to access my app from outside my local network.</p> <p>At home, I can access the app using the external IP address without any issues. I've port-forwarded ports 6001, 22, HTTP, HTTPS, and 8000 for the web UI. I can access the admin UI from outside my network with no problems, but the actual website running on Coolify remains inaccessible.</p> <p>I've tried disabling all firewalls, but that didn't help. I also used some remote online browsers to see if they could access the website, but no luck there either. Interestingly, I faced a similar issue when using Nginx Proxy Manager.</p> <p>Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a h

I read and watched a few different guides on setting up NPM and I noticed some used wildcard certificates for ease of use and down the road expansion while others manually setup individual certificates for each subdomains. From a security standpoint, which is better and why? (Just a n00b trying to understand and learn best practices.)</p> <p>Edit: I read another advantage of wildcard certificates is that nobody can look up which subdomains are being used.

After years of hard work and countless iterations, I've developed an AI model that can tag images and videos with descriptive tags. This journey has been a bit like Edison's—finding many ways not to make an AI—but I'm thrilled to say that the result is something truly impressive.</p> <p>A few years ago, I developed the AI model behind <a href="https://pury.fi/site/">pury.fi</a>, which enables AI image censoring and body part identification. Building on that experience, I focused on creating an AI that could accurately tag images and videos. This AI model currently supports 35 different tags focused on various NSFW actions and is far better than any other NSFW tagging AI available online.</p> <p>Additionally, I developed a plugin to integrate with <a href="https://github.com/stashapp/stash">Stash</a>, a popular open-source, locally-hosted media server, allowing the AI to tag image

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>TL;DR: Why choose MeshVPN over a Wireguard server?</p> <p>Hey folks, just curious, can anyone explain why you'd pick Tailscale/Netbird/etc. over a standard Wireguard server on your router or on your network in a homelab setup?</p> <p>From what I gather, using something like Tailscale means a third party (the coordinator) holds the &quot;keys to your kingdom.&quot; I get that connections are direct and client-to-client, but the coordinator still approves them. Doesn't that kind of defeat the purpose of self-hosting? Someone at Tailscale could theoretically grant access, right?</p> <p>I know people might say you don't need to punch a hole in your firewall with Tailscale. But as far as I understand, a Wireguard port (which can be any port) only responds when it gets its certificate. Otherwise, it's seen as a closed port.</p> <p>With something like Netbird, you still need to open ports for the client to connect to the coordinator server, which could be a

I’m also nervous that if something happened to my service, I’d be locked out of everything. </p> <p>Currently looking at Authelia though. If you have experience running it, is it stable? Is it going to be a headache? Can I trust it for critical things like my tailscale auth provider?</p> <p>There are some things I just want to work 24/7 without my tinkering or intervention.

My NAS has 10GBe transfer speed and I’m transferring via smb and it’s pretty slow compared to what I can be doing. I read that the bottle neck is my hdd external drive since it’s connected to the iMac via usb -c. Is the only option getting another NAS that has greater than &gt;1 gbe transfer speeds?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Containers are mostly a convenience for software development. They make deployment, CI/CD, &amp; auto scaling easy with the added bonus of isolation. But how much of that is relevant in a self-hosting scenario where:</p> <ul> <li>you are your only user</li> <li>you don't write your own software</li> <li>you only have few home servers to maintain</li> </ul> <p>I'm looking to host DMZ services in a memory constrained raspberry pi (think of: SMTP, wireguard, reverse proxy for beefier servers). </p> <p>How much security would i be missing out if I'm not isolating each services in their own container?
