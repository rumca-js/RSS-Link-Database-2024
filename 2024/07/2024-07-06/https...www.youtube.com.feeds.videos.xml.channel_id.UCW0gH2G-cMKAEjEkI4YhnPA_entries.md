During my trip to New Zealand, the folks at Wētā Workshop made a dream of mine come true by turning me into a dwarf!  Join me as I get in the make-up chair, don dwarven armor, and go in search of a pint in Wellington!

NOTE: this is a rather simpler process than what Wētā uses for its productions - this go-round was for fun, not film!
