<p>Bermuda shorts have upped the ante and become one of this summer’s hottest trends</p><p>Now we actually have a summer to speak of, it’s the perfect look for the warmer weather. There is even a case for shorts in the workplace as the new crop of styles range from super chic knee-length suit shorts to sleek and tailored styles in office-appropriate pinstripe. George at Asda’s black linen with chalk stripe pair are a great place to start (£12). Alternatively, Me &amp; Em’s tailored black pair (£175) works well with summer’s other hot piece: the waistcoat. Add a blazer, belt and loafers to pull things together.</p><p>If knee-length shorts aren’t ordinarily your sartorial go-to, the runway shows may convince you otherwise. Steal styling tricks from the catwalk. At Marques’ Almeida, navy taffeta shorts were worn with a matching oversized shirt and strappy heels for evening; at Carven with a shirt and statement earrings; while at Chanel (left) they were denim-look with a smart bouclé jack

At that stage, with Switzerland behind after Jordan Pickford saved Manuel Akanki’s kick, it had to be England going through to the last four.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jul/06/england-switzerland-euro-2024-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Ben Hardy and Jason Patel excel in Sally El Hosaini’s gritty romance as a straight single white dad and a closet Asian nightclub performer navigate their mutual attraction</p><p>The world seems a little brighter when garage mechanic Luke (Ben Hardy) first meets drag artist Aysha (Jason Patel). Before stumbling by chance into an underground “gaysian” cabaret club, Luke, a straight single dad, plods from day to identical day in a life that seems to be painted in shades of dispiriting grey. Even his sex life – a functional, no-frills grapple with a disinterested woman in a patch of wasteland – is monochrome. But once he finds himself in Aysha’s orbit, colours flood the frame.</p><p>It’s an evocative visual leap that brings a touch of magic to this London, Essex and Manchester-set story, the latest picture from Sally El Hosaini, co-directed with long-term collaborator James Krishna Floyd (star of <em>My Brother </em><em>the Devil</em>, and the screenwriter of this film).

<p>Yes, Biden had a bad debate – but so did Trump. The media is once again repeating the mistakes of 2016</p><p>I am not usually one to offer diagnoses of people I’ve never met, but it does seem like the pundit class of the American media is suffering from severe memory loss. Because they’re doing exactly what they did in the 2016 presidential race – providing wildly asymmetrical and inflammatory coverage of the one running against Donald J Trump.</p><p>They have become a stampeding herd producing an avalanche of stories suggesting Biden is unfit, will lose, and should go away, at a point in the campaign in which replacing him would likely be somewhere between extremely difficult and utterly catastrophic. They do this while ignoring something every scholar and critic of journalism knows well and every journalist should.
