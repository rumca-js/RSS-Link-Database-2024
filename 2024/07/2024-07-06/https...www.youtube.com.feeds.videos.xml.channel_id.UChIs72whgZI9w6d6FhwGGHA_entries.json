In fact, a Google search simply of \"Zotac RMA\" (without even using a site flag) would surface private customer emails and contact information within 1 page, sometimes 2. We notified Zotac urgently and withheld reporting until the company removed access to as many of these files as possible. The rest remains cached, but there are tools to try and get it removed for affected users. Zotac has fixed the basics, so we felt comfortable to publish.\n\nSUPPORT OUR REPORTING DIRECTLY!
