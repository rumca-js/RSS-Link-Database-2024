The slightly bold theory I put forward in this talk is that we're on a verge of a golden age of local, home-cooked software and a new kind of developer \u2013 what I've called the barefoot developer.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It's a great talk, and the design of the slides is outstanding.</p>\n<p>It reminded me of Robin Sloan's <a href=\"https://www.robinsloan.com/notes/home-cooked-app/\">An app can be a home-cooked meal</a>, which Maggie references in the talk.
