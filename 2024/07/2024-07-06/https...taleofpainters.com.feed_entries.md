<p>In part 2 of our Skaventide review, we take a look at the new Core Book and the Fire &#038; Jade expansion book. We examine the structure of the rules for the 4th Edition of Warhammer Age of Sigmar for accessibility. From a casual player's perspective we share our thoughts on the new edition and the new Spearhead game mode. And: Can the presentation of the books match the quality of the previous edition?</p>
