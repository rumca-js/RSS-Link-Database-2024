Doesn't that kind of defeat the purpose of self-hosting? Someone at Tailscale could theoretically grant access, right?</p> <p>I know people might say you don't need to punch a hole in your firewall with Tailscale.

They make deployment, CI/CD, &amp; auto scaling easy with the added bonus of isolation. But how much of that is relevant in a self-hosting scenario where:</p> <ul> <li>you are your only user</li> <li>you don't write your own software</li> <li>you only have few home servers to maintain</li> </ul> <p>I'm looking to host DMZ services in a memory constrained raspberry pi (think of: SMTP, wireguard, reverse proxy for beefier servers). </p> <p>How much security would i be missing out if I'm not isolating each services in their own container? What wouldn't &quot;properly configured user permissions &amp; ACLs for each service&quot; protect me against?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Pocketenderman\"> /u/Pocketenderman </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1dweuqn/containers_vs_user_permissions_for_service/\">[li", "id": 816855, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1dweuqn/containers_vs_user_permissions_for_service", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/.rss", "source_obj__id": 450, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Containers vs User permissions for service isolation", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-07-06T00:52:54+00:00", "description": "<table> <tr><td> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1dwddzp/contabo_will_cheat_on_upgrade/\"> <img alt=\"Contabo will CHEAT on upgrade\" src=\"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/kgjJO92HiRHDe_UM8oMZZUl37khvfCL6IcvtjilMqEE.jpg\" title=\"Contabo will CHEAT on upgrade\" /> </a> </td><td> <!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Their cheating methodology</p> <p>6 cpu + 16 gb is priced at $9.50(excl tax) but upgrade for the same is around $23.13 (incl tax) .</p> <p>Price I pay if I upgrade</p> <p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/j21mpwm5qsad1.png?width=806&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3366fa966d6e4c88c65c0cdbf580c0cc8b4c27da\">https://preview.redd.it/j21mpwm5qsad1.png?width=806&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3366fa966d6e4c88c65c0cdbf580c0cc8b4c27da</a></p> <p>Price new customers pay</p> <p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/kpwth7j8qsad1.png?width=1993&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a6f28389c0fa1e8558a7c00bdc842751546940fe\">https://preview.redd.it/kpwth7j8qsad1.png?width=199", "id": 816768, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1dwddzp/contabo_will_cheat_on_upgrade", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/.rss", "source_obj__id": 450, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/kgjJO92HiRHDe_UM8oMZZUl37khvfCL6IcvtjilMqEE.jpg", "title": "Contabo will CHEAT on upgrade", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-07-06T00:51:39+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi, I need a tool to schedule social media posts (tiktok, instagram, twitter, facebook, possibly linkedin) for a dozen or so accounts at once (I'm going to open a marketing agency and would like to have all the stuff and accounts on hand)</p> <p>In addition, it would be nice if such a tool had some kind of integration with automation tools (prefers <a href=\"http://n8n.io\">n8n.io</a>, however, it can be other however it also has to be self-hosted)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Studziakskrr\"> /u/Studziakskrr </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1dwdd4t/social_media_post_planner/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1dwdd4t/social_media_post_planner/\">[comments]</a></span>", "id": 816767, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1dwdd4t/social_media_post_planner", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/.rss", "source_obj__id": 450, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Social Media Post Planner", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-07-06T00:19:52+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Firstly, this post is <strong>not</strong> to celebrate somebody losing their job, nor to poke fun at a company struggling in today's market.</p> <p>However, it might go some way to explaining why Portainer are <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1dvxrji/portainer_5_nodes_ee_no_longer_free/\">tightening up the free Business plan from 5 to 3 nodes</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://x.com/theseanodell/status/1809328238097056035\">https://x.com/theseanodell/status/1809328238097056035</a></p> <blockquote> <p><em>Sean O'Dell</em></p> <p>My time at Portainer came to an end in May due to restructuring/layoffs.
