Zotac was hosting customer RMA files, business-to-business transactions, invoices, bill of lading memos, credit memos, customer Amazon order history, chat logs, email logs, and addresses and phone numbers in a way which was publicly discoverable through Google. In fact, a Google search simply of "Zotac RMA" (without even using a site flag) would surface private customer emails and contact information within 1 page, sometimes 2. We notified Zotac urgently and withheld reporting until the company removed access to as many of these files as possible. The rest remains cached, but there are tools to try and get it removed for affected users. Zotac has fixed the basics, so we felt comfortable to publish.
