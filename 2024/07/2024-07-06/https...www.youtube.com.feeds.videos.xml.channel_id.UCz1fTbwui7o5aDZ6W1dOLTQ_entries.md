Star Wars The Acolyte is even worse than even the most dedicated Star Wars fan could imagine - even if you forgive them from axing Master Indara right from the start. So those excited about seeing Matrix's Trinity as a Jedi might be a bit disappointed. Politics aside, the Acolyte is "more problem than story" especially when episode tries so hard to be Game of Thrones it ends up spending 40 minutes giving us only half an episode's worth of plot.

So let's step into the inferno together and traverse this endless road paved with horrible intentions and writing so terrible even fanfiction would be too generous a term.
