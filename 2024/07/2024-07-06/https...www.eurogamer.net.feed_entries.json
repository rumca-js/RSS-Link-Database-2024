near perfect remaster for fans of the 2003 original, with this cult classic's visuals improved over the previous HD release from 2011. Almost every texture, shader, and material upgraded with a new asset - making for an often satisfying side-by-side comparison. Added to that, current-gen consoles like PS5 and Xbox Series X are also capable of running the game at 4K resolution at 60 frames per second. So from the outset, it'sa slick upgrade that also thankfully avoids straying too far from director Michel Ancel and his team's original vision.\n</p><p>\nHowever, it doesn't stop there. Developer Ubisoft adds a generous dose of extras to the package here. Hours of making-of documents are crammed in: concept art, pre-release videos and even footage of removed levels and features make an appearance.
