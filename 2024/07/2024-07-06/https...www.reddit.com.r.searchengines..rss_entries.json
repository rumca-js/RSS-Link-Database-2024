What are your experiences.</p> <p>Duckduckgo (bing) is good for generic searches. Doesn't try to cram products and populist results down my throat that much.</p> <p>Yandex seems to best for exact text search. a line of dialogue from a movie tv episode to figure out where it came from. Also the reverse image search seems to be the best. It often comes up with photos of the same photoshoot or with info about the picture. One huge drawback is that it provides description, suggestions, etc for results in russian even on <a href=\"https://yandex.com\">yandex.com</a>. I complained, but if others would it might help. Meanwhile using the translator helps.</p> <p>Tineye is good when the results contain mostly the same image, otherwise it often gives no results. And often offers dead links.</p> <p>I didn't try Brave or Qwant that much. Results seemed to be better with others.
