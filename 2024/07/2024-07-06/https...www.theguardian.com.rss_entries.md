<p>Striker might not be Cruyffian idea of the Total Football frontman but he found way to break down Turkey defence</p><p>Orthodoxy, in the end, prevailed. International football, perhaps, always has a slightly retro feel, with its teams of mismatched parts, the basic pressing structures, the preponderance of games decided not by tactical plans or even ability, but by human desire and passion and doing the right thing at just the right time. It is, perhaps, a more heroic form of the game, a world in which there is still a place for champions to rise above the analysis of the technocrats.</p><p>And there is little more retro than the tactic, in extremis, of throwing on a big man. For Ronald Koeman, as for Louis van Gaal before him, when there is an emergency for the Netherlands, call for Wout Weghorst. The Burnley striker might not be the Cruyffian idea of the Total Footballing front man, but this is not the first time he has turned a game for his country after coming off the bench. We

<p>The party must look to a new generation and restore its reputation for economic competence</p><p>One Nation or hard right? “Red wall” or “blue wall”? Cameroon or Faragist? As yet another Conservative leadership contest looms, the usual questions are already being asked. In making their choice, the very first thing the Tories should do is work out what went wrong. Some of which wasn’t their fault – such as Covid and the Ukraine war. And some of which was: consider the Boris Johnson chaos and Liz Truss’s mini-budget.</p><p>Why do voters elect the Conservatives in the first place? Because, rightly or wrongly, they associate the party with economic competence. So the first task of a new leader will be to apologise for the mistakes of the past, and begin rebuilding the party’s reputation for economic competence. That will take a while. Other than their standard of living, voters’ two other big concerns are the NHS and migration. That means value for money in the first – and supporting W

<p>The new business secretary will have big calls to make within a few days of sitting down at his desk</p><p>If Jonathan Reynolds was expecting a honeymoon period as the new business secretary, a glance at the mounting list of issues that require his attention will quash that idea. From a potential renationalisation to angry steelworkers and posties, Reynolds has an overflowing in-tray.</p><p>So acute are some of the problems that Keir Starmer’s chief of staff, Sue Gray, prepared an internal dossier, described as “Sue’s shit list” by some, which included the potential collapse of Thames Water among other issues including failing councils and prison overcrowding. Here, we examine some of Reynolds’s most pressing priorities.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jul/06/thames-tata-shein-it-wont-be-business-as-usual-for-labour-jonathan-reynolds">Continue reading...</a>

They&nbsp;would be announcing upcoming titles, trying to get the booksellers excited about them. I&nbsp;was&nbsp;one of the journalists, but I only remember one author and one book from that afternoon. The author’s editor, James Hale, was thrilled about&nbsp;a first novel, which Macmillan would soon be publishing, and which James had discovered on the “slush pile” of unsolicited manuscripts. The author had been asked to say a few words to the assembled booksellers about himself and his book.</p><p>The author had dark, curly auburn hair and a ginger beard that was barely more than ambitious stubble. He was tall, and his accent was Scottish. He told us that he had really wanted to be a science fiction writ

<p>A personal perspective on Ghislaine Maxwell offers an empathetic telling of a horrific story</p><p>It’s not often a book reverberates around my head for days. But there is something brilliantly unsettling about this account of the trial of Ghislaine Maxwell, the British socialite jailed for procuring young girls for the billionaire paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Having watched from the press box as the case descended into a media circus, Lucia Osborne-Crowley begins by promising to put the victims back at the heart of the story, tracing the impact of&nbsp;the abuse they suffered as children through to their middle-aged lives. But it soon emerges that this book isn’t just about the vulnerable teenagers Maxwell and Epstein groomed for sexual entertainment, exploiting their desperation for affection or for money. It’s also about the author and, less comfortably, the reader too.</p><p>A paralegal turned freelance journalist, Osborne-Crowley was abused herself from the age of nine by a non

The story of a newly divorced hepatologist dis­cov­er­ing the joys of dating apps while trying to look after his two kids when his ex-wife goes missing on a yoga retreat, Fleishman Is in Trouble was one of the smartest, funniest novels of recent years. It was made into a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/">hit TV series</a> with a starry cast, for which Brodesser-Akner wrote the screenplay. But writing her second novel almost drove her “insane”.

<p>Former Arsenal player’s playmaking responsibilities will define his country’s fate against England</p><p>Over dinner and a few glasses of wine, Switzerland’s two leaders squared things up. It was late in the winter and things were purring along for Granit Xhaka at Bayer Leverkusen. They were already set fair for the Bundesliga title, thanks in large part to his endeavours since arriving from Arsenal, but the other side of the coin was murkier. The national team had qualified for Euro 2024 but their performances had dropped off a cliff. Xhaka had previously been critical of what he perceived as sloppy training sessions and there was an urgent need to find common ground with the manager, Murat Yakin, when the pair sat down for the latest of several earnest chats.</p><p>Now Switzerland are a win away from the European Championship semi-finals and a sleek, confident team have been remoulded firmly in Xhaka’s image.

Blessed relief!</p><p>Very rare a TV show affects me anymore, of course. I&nbsp;have seen, simply, too many of them. I have seen every configuration of dating show and every possible ITV2 Love Island spin-off reality format. I’ve seen every Channel 4 property programme and every doomed BBC One attempt at a Saturday night light entertainment blockbuster. I was the person who watched every single British odd couple road trip show they made in the wake of Covid. I’ve seen those shows on Apple TV+ that even the executives at Apple TV+ forgot they commissioned (“Hold on, what’s this line on the balance sheet marked ‘Joseph Gordon-Levitt’? We <em>paid</em> him for that?”). Every brown-and-grey “the enemy is at the gates, my lord!” attempt at an epic franchise in the wake of Game of Thrones and all the spin-off stuff Prime has done since The Boys.

Use the leftover oil for frying a seafood dish such as a kedgeree or when sauteing the base of a fish stew, or turn it into a powerful and flavourful dressing, as in today’s potato salad recipe. I’d recommend using canned fish in extra-virgin olive oil, if you can, but in truth any oil will work.

They welcome the crushing of the Conservatives. It’s sometimes forgotten by centrists that the Labour left hates the Tories with a particular intensity. The left’s optimists also often hope, despite evidence to the contrary, that a Labour victory will open up new socialist possibilities – or at least provide some emotional catharsis.
