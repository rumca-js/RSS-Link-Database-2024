<p>The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-prime-day/">Amazon Prime Day</a> sale ends tonight, but don't think that all opportunities to save have come and gone. In typical Amazon fashion, most of the best Prime Day deals on day one of the sale remain the best offers now on day two — if they didn't sell out already, that is.</p>
<p>Thankfully, many of the best tech deals we curated yesterday are still around today. If you didn't get the chance to shop yesterday, Engadget has you covered. We've collected the best Prime Day deals you can still get right now before the shopping event is over tonight.

<p>As far as the EU is concerned, TikTok requires strong, ongoing regulations. The <a href="https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/jcms/p1_4470948/en/">EU's General Court dismissed an action</a> brought by TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, which argued that the platform shouldn't be considered a &quot;gatekeeper&quot; under the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-uk-passes-its-version-of-the-eus-digital-markets-act-175642166.html">Digital Markets Act</a> (DMA).

<p>At about 1,230 feet across, the Apophis asteroid is slightly smaller than the Empire State Building. On April 13, 2029, that skyscraper-sized space rock will approach Earth, and the European Space Agency plans (ESA) to shadow it. The <a href="https://www.esa.int/Space_Safety/Planetary_Defence/Introducing_Ramses_ESA_s_mission_to_asteroid_Apophis">ESA has announced the Rapid Apophis Mission for Space Safety (Ramses)</a>, a planetary defense mission. The plan is to have a spacecraft reach Apophis in early 2029 and follow it during the flyby — though this would require quick action for an April 2028 launch.</p>
<p>Scientists discovered <a href="https://www.engadget.com/osiris-rex-apex-apophis-asteroid-visit-154021788.html">Apophis</a> in 2004, and it wasn't until 2021 that NASA confirmed it shouldn't smash into Earth for at least 100 years, despite the upcoming close encounter. Instead, it will come within 20,000 miles of Earth — less than one-tenth the Moon's proximity. According to t

<p>DJI has introduced a new video transmission device that will allow creators to control cameras and gimbals and view video from up to 1.8 miles away. Called DJI SDR Transmission (SDR stands for "software defined radio"), it's designed for use in "complex environments" and is targeting small- to medium-sized film crews.</p>
<p>The system consists of transmitter and receiver (each weighing 5.1 ounces), sold separately or in a combo. You can also purchase a phone or tablet holder kit, along with an RX to phone connection cable.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>On monitors (which can be dedicated Atomos-type systems, iPhones or tablets), filmmakers will see a 1080p/60fps live feed with a 20Mbps bitrate and latency as low as 35 milliseconds. Video can be transmitted up to three kilometers (1.8 miles) and remain stable in obstacle-laden environments thanks to "superior penetration capabilities," DJI said.&nbsp;</p>

But if you’d rather work from the comfort of your own home — be that an apartment, dorm room or your parents’ basement — outfitting your space appropriately can make you more comfortable and focused. This is the gear that’s worked for us over the years, with options to improve ergonomics, brighten up your desk and do justice to your focus music.

<p>&nbsp;Some of the world’s largest tech companies trained their AI models on datasets that included transcripts of more than 173,000 YouTube videos without permission. That’s according to an investigation from <em>Proof News</em>, which laid out how Apple, NVIDIA and Anthropic, among other companies, used transcripts of YouTube videos from more than 48,000 channels. This goes against YouTube’s own platform rules, which Google execs have repeatedly mentioned.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Apple was criticized for failing to reveal the source of training data for Apple Intelligence, the company’s own spin on generative AI.</p>
<p>Not only have these AI models been trained on some of your favorite YouTube stars, like Marques Brownlee and MrBeast, but also Engadget’s own Cherlynn Low. (I love you, Cher.)</p>

<p>Tesla has started selling a couple of new accessories for the Cybertruck, including a <a href="https://shop.tesla.com/product/cybertruck-tailgate-shield">$300 tailgate shield</a>. It's a custom-made padding for the vehicle, designed to hang off its tailgate and protect it from any equipment you're hauling.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We gotta say, it's admittedly quite amusing to see Tesla selling an accessory to protect the Cybertruck when one of the vehicle's promotional videos shows someone <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teRRk-0KHus">shooting guns at it</a>. When the company debuted the model, it also staged a demonstration to show that it can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bipo0_gvLFw">withstand a sledgehammer</a>. Still, if you regularly put, say, a road or a mountain bike in the bed of your truck, the shield could prevent it from banging up against the vehicle's tailgate and cause scratches and other cosmetic imperfections.

<p>Canon has unveiled its most important camera in years — the EOS R1 mirrorless. Launched alongside the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/canon-eos-r5-ii-hands-on-nifty-eye-tracking-autofocus-and-reduced-overheating-problems">45-megapixel R5 II</a>, it’s the company's new flagship designed to replace the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/canon-1dx-mark-iii-hands-010454141.html">1DX Mark III DSLR</a> and help Canon maintain its leadership in the pro sports photography field.</p>
<p>The R1 is all about speed, with the stacked sensor allowing 40 fps RAW bursts with continuous autofocus. Other features are designed to help nail crucial shots, including pre-capture, eye-tracking AF and sports-specific settings. At the same time, it should be great for video, thanks to its support for 6K RAW capture.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>One potential downside is the 24-megapixel resolution, which is lower than rivals like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-a1-review-8k-mirrorle

<p>Tinder is trying to end the long-festering nightmare of having to actually look at yourself long enough to choose profile pictures. The new <a href="https://www.help.tinder.com/hc/en-us/articles/21276850679693-Photo-Selector"><ins>Photo Selector feature</ins></a> uses AI to pore through pictures to pick the ones most likely to get that much-coveted right swipe.</p>
<p>The tool has been in a testing phase <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/02/tinder-tests-new-ai-photo-selection-feature/"><ins>since August of last year</ins></a> and it’s finally ready for prime time. Photo Selector works by automatically browsing through a smartphone’s entire camera roll and using AI algorithms to pick the, well, hottest ones. It’s like a supercharged version of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-10-13-tinder-smart-photos-uses-swipe-data-to-select-your-best-pic.html"><ins>pre-existing Smart Photos feature</ins></a>.</p>

<p>As it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0ZHqRz9xeQ">teased earlier</a>, Canon has launched the R5 II, a successor to the powerful but imperfect <a href="https://www.engadget.com/canon-eos-r5-review-150038797-150038558.html">EOS R5</a>. With a new 45-megapixel backside-illuminated (BSI) stacked sensor, it not only has superior specs for video, shooting speeds and more, but also adds advanced features like eye-controlled AF. The R5 II was launched alongside Canon's new flagship, the EOS R1, which I've covered in a separate post.</p>
<p>With the new R5, Canon has mostly dealt with the original's primary problem: overheating while shooting video. To see what’s different and try out some of the new features, I spent some time with an R5 II pre-production camera in Phoenix, Arizona.</p>

<p>The R5 II’s body is largely the same as before, but there are a couple of key changes. First off, Canon h
