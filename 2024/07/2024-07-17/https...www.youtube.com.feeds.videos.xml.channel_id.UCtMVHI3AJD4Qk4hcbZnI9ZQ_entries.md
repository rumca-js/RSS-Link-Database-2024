Hello guys and gals, it's me Mutahar again! This time we take a look at Cody Ko and some rather recent allegations that need to be properly addressed. We've looked recently at situations involving Dr. Disrespect and the weird relationships creators have with fans that can cross into legally and morally questionable situations. This shouldn't happen and if theses situations are true then the community should correct itself. Thanks for watching!
