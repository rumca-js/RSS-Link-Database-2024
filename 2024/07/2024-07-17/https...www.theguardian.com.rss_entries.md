<p>Palliative care charities are facing a funding crisis – they should be included in Lord Darzi’s review of the NHS</p><p>Close to 600,000 people die in the UK annually – a figure that was higher during the pandemic, but has since fallen back. More than half are at home or in a care home; most of the rest are in hospital. But for about 28,000 people who need specialist end-of-life care (nearly 5% of all deaths), a hospice is where they receive it. A much larger number receive palliative care from hospices in the community (more than 80% of hospices’ work is delivered in this way, through partnerships with the NHS). Staff also support the relatives of those who are dying, including children. But their valuable work is now in jeopardy as the sector faces its <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/article/2024/jul/16/fifth-of-uk-hospices-cutting-services-amid-funding-crisis-finds-report">worst funding crisis</a> in 20 years.</p><p>Hospices are well-regarded and rightly so.

In the process of making coca paste, these labs discharge chemical waste – including acetone, gasoline and sulphuric acid – into rivers and soil.</p><p>Increasingly, these outfits are branching into illegal logging, gold dredging and fishing, in part because these activities allow them to launder money made from drug trafficking.

The country is a gerontocracy led by ailing leaders and with a crisis of confidence in its dominant ideology; it is a flailing superpower suffering foreign humiliation (not least in Afghanistan); and its economic system struggles to meet the needs of many of its people. The similarities are a little uncanny.</p><p>There are, of course, clear differences too.

<p>A stroll through 19th-century Paris that blends literary criticism and psychogeography</p><p>Eric Hazan, a lifelong Parisian who died in June, wrote several books about his hometown, with a particular focus on the class politics of the built environment. In Balzac’s Paris he revisits the 19th-century social geography of the French capital through the fiction of one of its most famous novelists. Honoré de Balzac’s La Comédie humaine (Human Comedy) – a vast series of novels and stories depicting French society between 1814 and 1848 – is one of the canonical texts of literary realism. In these works, Hazan writes, the street is more than just a setting: “The places where the characters live and evolve are part of their personality; they define them in the same way as their physique, their dress or their psychology.”</p><p>First published in France in 2018 and now available in English thanks to David Fernbach’s translation, Balzac’s Paris is a blend of literary criticism and historical

<p>The FDA’s recent rejection of MDMA isn’t surprising. Too many advocates are trying to frame psychedelics as a miracle drug</p><p>Earlier this month, an advisory panel rejected MDMA-assisted therapy for PTSD, possibly dooming US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of the drug commonly called ecstasy. In a public meeting alongside FDA staff, panel members said that the research neither adequately accounted for abuse risks nor proved the drug’s efficacy in combination with psychotherapy.</p><p>This decision dealt a major blow to Lykos Therapeutics, the for-profit public benefit corporation of the non-profit Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (Maps), which sponsored the trials. More broadly, the rejection has been described as a drastic setback for the psychedelic movement as a whole. For several years now, it seemed that greater acceptance and new legal spaces for psychedelics were a certainty. Then, scientists appeared at the FDA hearing and everything went

<p>A campaigning lawyer’s account of her defining cases throws a feminist light on the UK justice system</p><p>In 2011, Harriet Wistrich got a call about Sally Challen, who had been&nbsp;convicted of the murder of&nbsp;her husband, Richard. Sally had bludgeoned him to death with a hammer at their Surrey home and driven to Beachy Head in Sussex with the aim of jumping off the cliff (she was talked down by suicide prevention negotiators). Challen’s family felt&nbsp;her defence team had failed to highlight Richard’s abusive behaviour towards Sally. In court she had been painted as a jealous wife, enraged by her husband’s infidelities.</p><p>At first, Wistrich, a lawyer specialising in human rights cases, struggled to see how she might help Challen, whose defence of diminished responsibility had already been rejected by a jury. Appealing against a criminal conviction without fresh evidence is no easy task. But, talking to Challen in prison, Wistrich was able to build a detailed picture of

Only Spain and Germany were consistently brilliant in their attacking verve. Dani Olmo was one of Spain’s best players and I adored the movement and invention of Nico Williams. Georges Mikautadze was a real surprise in a very dynamic Georgia team and I loved the puckish cheekiness and control of Arda Guler for Turkey.

<p>Art and counselling are helping women and girls in Kenya to process anger and forgive family members, who are often the ones who subjected them to genital mutilation</p><p>The first of Sara Sori’s portraits depicting women at various stages of life shows a young, happy girl. “If you harm [a girl] at this stage she is ruined for ever. And this is the stage where I was violated,” says Sori, from Isiolo, in northern Kenya, who was forced to undergo female genital mutilation as a child.</p><p>Another portrait shows a girl with her mouth sewn shut, “giving in to what life has dictated for her and to prevent her from expressing any anger”. Another shows “the age of regret, of missed opportunities” of an older woman. “This is where my grandmother is now. I loved her so much.

<p>Travellers gather before a feast of the dead in this homage to Arabian Nights which spotlights a little-known community in northeast India</p><p>“Rain time in Sohra was also story time,” we’re told early on in this seminal and shapeshifting novel about the north-eastern Indian Khasi community. “The perfect time to tell a tale is a rainy night.” A real-life journey the author made to the jungle village of Nongshyrkon, nestled in the West Khasi Hills of north-east India, inspired the book. It’s also a homage to&nbsp;the&nbsp;narrator’s home town, Sohra – changed to Cherrapunjee in colonial times – “the wettest desert on earth”. But through sheer determination and&nbsp;passion for storytelling, as the&nbsp;rain&nbsp;falls, stories grow.</p><p>At the start, Ap Jutang lays out his intentions: “It is very much in the spirit of Hamlet that I would like to tell you the story of my people – to clear their wounded name.” In the 1990s, the narrator found himself in Delhi, and discovered how t

<p>A masterful guide to the new age of authoritarianism</p><p>Until around 2015, I tended to be moderately positive about the world. There were far more democracies than when I started at the BBC in 1966, I would tell myself, and markedly fewer dictatorships. Africa and Latin America, once host to so many military dictatorships, were now mostly run by elected leaders. The terrible threat of nuclear war had receded. A billion people were being lifted out of poverty. Yes, what Vladimir Putin had done in Crimea in 2014 was worrying, and Xi Jinping was starting to make disturbing speeches about Muslims and Uyghurs; but given that I’d seen Soviet communism melt away across eastern Europe and in Russia itself, I still felt there was reason for optimism.</p><p>That pretty much ended in 2016. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum">Brexit</a> damaged the European project, and Donald Trump shook the columns of American leadership.

<p>More than anything, his legacy will be in reminding English fans of every background of one often-forgotten truth: that we are all on the same team</p><p>English football fans may never agree on Gareth Southgate’s footballing legacy, and will long debate whether he deprived the so-called golden generation of ending 58 years of hurt. But what cannot and should not be disputed is that Southgate has fundamentally reshaped England men’s football off the field.</p><p>It’s not just that when English footballers gather together they no longer carry their fierce club rivalries into the England camp (Liverpool players dining apart from the Manchester United contingent, say). It’s that by breaking down barriers no other England manager has ever done or even attempted, he has created an inclusive, caring team ethos.

Moves have been named after Biles, some of which have been completed only by her.</p><p>But the Biles story is much more dramatic than her legendary physical prowess.
