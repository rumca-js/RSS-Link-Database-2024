<p>Google on Wednesday rolled out a series of GenAI-powered developer tools, including a coder-focused translation tool that one IDC analyst described as “an absolutely amazing and remarkable project.” </p>



<p>Language translation is nothing new, but the particular challenges of translating coding phrases into multiple languages while allowing the GenAI engine to understand the nuances of intent and accurately conveying them in multiple languages is quite difficult, said Arnal Dayaratna, the IDC vice president for software development.</p>

<p>You’ve heard of the FAQ, which is typically a list of frequently asked questions on some topic or another.

<p>Over the last few years, Microsoft’s <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2254808/get-started-with-visual-studio-code.html">Visual Studio Code</a> has emerged as a popular developer’s tool. It’s a lightweight editor at its core, but with a vast array of extensions that transform it into an IDE for many languages and development tasks. But not everyone’s happy with VS Code, especially because it is exclusively stewarded by Microsoft.</p>



<p>One project, <a href="https://vscodium.com" rel="nofollow">VSCodium</a>, repackages VS Code’s core open source components, minus Microsoft’s branding, closed-source elements, and telemetry. Another project, <a href="https://theia-ide.org" rel="nofollo
