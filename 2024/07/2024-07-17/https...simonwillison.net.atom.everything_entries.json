Here's my abstract:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Plugins offer a powerful way to extend software packages. Tools that support a plugin architecture include WordPress, Jupyter, VS Code and pytest - each of which benefits from an enormous array of plugins adding all kinds of new features and expanded capabilities.</p>\n<p>Adding plugin support to an open source project can greatly reduce the friction involved in attracting new contributors. Users can work independently and even package and publish their work without needing to directly coordinate with the project's core maintainers. As a maintainer this means you can wake up one morning and your software grew new features without you even having to review a pull request!</p", "id": 878209, "language": "en-us", "link": "https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jul/17/djangocon-us-2024-talks/#atom-everything", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 29, "page_rating_contents": 90, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://simonwillison.net/atom/everything", "source_obj__id": 423, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Announcing our DjangoCon US 2024 Talks!", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-07-17T03:08:02+00:00", "description": "<blockquote cite=\"https://lattice.com/blog/leading-the-way-in-responsible-ai-employment\"><p>Update, July 12: This innovation sparked a lot of conversation and questions that have no answers yet.
