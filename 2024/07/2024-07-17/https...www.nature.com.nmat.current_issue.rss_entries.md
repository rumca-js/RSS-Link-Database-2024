<p>Nature Materials, Published online: 17 July 2024; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41563-024-01938-5">doi:10.1038/s41563-024-01938-5</a></p>Microbial products only work if the microorganisms are kept alive — usually through the use of cold chains. High-throughput mapping of the microbial–material combinations landscape generated specific dry formulations that enable the microorganisms to survive extreme storage and processing conditions.
