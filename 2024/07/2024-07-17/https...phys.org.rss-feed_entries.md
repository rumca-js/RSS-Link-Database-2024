More than 20 million drivers are stopped by police every year in the U.S. Although traffic stops are relatively routine, they can also turn deadly, particularly for minority drivers. It's why some states have started to more closely examine racial disparities in traffic stops in an attempt to mitigate them.

The "power plants" of living cells, the mitochondria, probably evolved through endosymbiosis: A bacterium migrated into a primordial cell and eventually developed into an organelle that provides the cell with energy, among other things. Mitochondria produce some of the proteins they need themselves—with the help of special protein factories called mitoribosomes, which consist of RNA and proteins.

Most influenza viruses enter human or animal cells through specific pathways on the cells' surface. Researchers at the University of Zurich have now discovered that certain human flu viruses and avian flu viruses can also use a second entry pathway, a protein complex of the immune system, to infect cells. This ability helps the viruses infect different species—and potentially jump between animals and humans.

Snot might not be the first place you'd expect nanobots to be swimming around. But this slimy secretion exists in more places than just your nose and piles of dirty tissues—it also lines and helps protect the lungs, stomach, intestines and eyes. And now, researchers reporting in ACS Nano have demonstrated in mice that their tiny, enzyme-powered "snot bots" can push through the defensive, sticky layer and potentially deliver drugs more efficiently.

Phages, viruses that attack bacteria, have a head and a tail. The head contains the phage's genetic material and the tail is used to identify a potential host, that is, a bacterial cell into which it can inject this material. Once the injection is complete, the phage hijacks the bacterium's cellular machinery and forces it to produce new copies of itself, which ultimately burst the cell and infect other bacteria in the colony.
