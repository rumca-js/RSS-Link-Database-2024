Jay Inslee visited the Quinault Indian Reservation on Tuesday to help announce $52 million in funding for tribes to implement climate resiliency projects. The funding comes from the state&#8217;s Tribal Climate Resilience Grant Program, which supports disaster preparedness efforts and clean energy projects. The program is funded by the Climate Commitment Act, which created a cap-and-invest market to help limit carbon emissions from large polluters. The Quinault Indian Nation, located in Northwest Washington along the Pacific Ocean, is threatened by rising sea levels and increasing flooding, The Associated Press reported this month.

Researchers from the University of Washington&#8217;s Center for an Informed Public (CIP) tracked this process, as they do with other crises and breaking news events, to analyze what they call &#8220;collective sensemaking,&#8221; where people use social media to gather evidence and select frames that shape how they interpret such evidence.

That brings the total sum invested in the sector to more than $7.1 billion, according to a report out Wednesday from the Fusion Industry Association. As the world shifts to clean energy and the adoption of power-hungry artificial intelligence surges, there is an increasing urgency to develop and deploy more carbon-free energy. Some are hopeful that fusion power &#8212; a nearly infinite energy source that replicates the reactions that power the sun &#8212; could&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2024/gov-inslee-sen-murray-visit-washington-state-fusion-startups-as-funding-heats-up-despite-risks/\">Read More</a>", "id": 883375, "language": "en-US", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2024/gov-inslee-sen-murray-visit-washington-state-fusion-startups-as-funding-heats-up-despite-risks", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 29, "page_rating_contents": 90, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed", "source_obj__id": 131, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Gov.

The companies on Wednesday announced plans to place 100 chargers at Starbucks locations nationwide, starting with the West Coast&#8217;s Interstate-5 corridor.&#160; Exact sites were not announced, but the companies said they will focus on core urban areas and current charging deserts along the 1,400-mile route.

More than a year after the tech giant issued a call for corporate and tech employees to return to the office at least three days per week, outdoor and indoor tables were full at a number of restaurants and cafes, lines snaked down various blocks where food trucks were parked, and foot traffic in general seemed more robust.

That&#8217;s the word from Kyle Lui, a longtime Silicon Valley venture capitalist who recently moved to Seattle and is a general partner at Bling Capital. Lui tells GeekWire he&#8217;s loving Seattle&#8217;s startup scene so far, describing it as &#8220;collaborative&#8221; and &#8220;under-invested.&#8221; But he&#8217;s noticed something stark about the region&#8217;s entrepreneurs, especially compared to founders in the Bay Area. &#8220;I think the biggest challenge to the Seattle ecosystem is the breadth of ambition of the founders here,&#8221; Lui said.
