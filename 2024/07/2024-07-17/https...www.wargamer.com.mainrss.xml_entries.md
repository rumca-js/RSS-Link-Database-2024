								<p>The <strong>Warhammer 40k primarchs</strong> are immensely powerful Space Marine generals in Games Workshop's grim, dark Warhammer 40,000 sci-fi wargame universe, and their actions have driven some of the biggest story events to shaped the setting - from the ancient Horus Heresy to current 40k lore. Read on to meet all 20 (or perhaps 18), and find out where they each ended up.</p>

								<p>Calling all <strong>Lego</strong> aficionados! There are fantastic savings for you to bag on so many Lego sets during Amazon Prime Day this year. Of all the sets available, the one that stands out the most to me has to be the Lego Ideas Tree House, simply because it’s such an intricate and imaginative construction, and now comes with a nice big discount applied.</p>
<p>Seeing this Lego Tree House on sale is a big deal as it doesn’t tend to get discounted - let alone by 34% ($83). To see if the deal is <em>actually</em> worth taking advantage of, I checked its price history and can confirm that it's currently at the lowest since the Black Friday season last year.</p>

								<p>The Imagine: Courageous Critters collection for MTG Bloomburrow reimagines popular planeswalkers as cute woodland animals. All of them, that is, except for the silver golem Karn, who&rsquo;s not become a sweet little critter, but a rather disturbing-looking metal tree. Whereas Jace became a fox, Liliana gets to be a squirrel, and Teferi is a bird, &hellip; <a href="https://www.wargamer.com/magic-the-gathering/mtg-golem-planeswalker-karn-tree-bloomburrow">Continued</a></p>
