Bassist Mike Gordon and drummer Jon Fishman also performed for our Tiny Desk (home) concert series in 2020 with guitarist Leo Kottke. And now, finally, we get a full Phish Tiny Desk concert.\n\nThe set began with \u201cSigma Oasis,\u201d which included a little musical reference to the All Things Considered theme song. The band continued with \u201cEvolve,\u201d a track from its 16th studio album released last week. Before the band\u2019s final song, Anastasio and Gordon warmed up their fingers on tiny trampolines, which likely had the uninitiated scratching their heads. But for fans of this band, it was a clear signal of what was coming next: \u201cYou Enjoy Myself,\u201d a song that dates back to the band\u2019s beginnings and can safely be called a Phish classic. In live performances, the jam segment features choreographed bouncing, and the band brought that spectacle right into our office.\n\nAfter, the band ended", "id": 879447, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad8bvpdoEqE", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A", "source_obj__id": 225, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/ad8bvpdoEqE/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Phish: Tiny Desk Concert", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
