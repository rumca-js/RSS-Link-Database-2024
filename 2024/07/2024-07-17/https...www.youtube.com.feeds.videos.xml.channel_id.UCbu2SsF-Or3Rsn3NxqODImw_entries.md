PlayStation’s hero shooter from developer Firewalk Studios Concord just wrapped up its first beta weekend, and the response has been pretty positive! Fortunately, if you missed out, another beta weekend, this time open to everyone, is coming right up starting Friday July 19.

Unfortunately, the beta for some reason does not include a training mode for you to test out each of its many heroes, so the only way to try them out is to hop into a match. To give you an idea of what you’re getting into, we thought we’d explain what every character does and how best to play them.
