<p>Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba is a wildly popular anime and manga series that stars a captivating cast of characters all seeking to protect innocents from insidious threats. My wife and I are huge fans of the show to the point that we’ve obtained dozens of Banpresto, Figurizm, and Masterlise figures for our humble collection. It’s also why I was intrigued by Demon Slayer: Sweep the Board!, a virtual board game adaptation of the series from CyberConnect 2 and Sega.</p><p dir="ltr">Following its release on Nintendo Switch this past April, Demon Slayer: Sweep the Board has been released on additional platforms. Unfortunately, however, it seems my wait for Sweep the Board to come to PC was not worth it. After nearly 10 hours of playing, I still have a hard time discerning just who exactly this game was made for. From clunky controls to boring minigames, Sweep the Board feels like a party game that lacks any sense of "party."</p><figure style="width: 1920px;"><a href="https://www.games

<p>Coming off the heels of the decade-long Hydaelyn and Zodiark saga, Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail takes you to completely new territory, quite literally. For once, you--the Warrior of Light--are offered the chance for some peace and quiet alongside your friends, with no calamitous threat looming over your shoulder. There are no dragons to slay, gods to fell, or villains to vanquish on the agenda. Hell, we traveled to the literal edge of the universe, I think it's fair to say we deserve this break.</p><p dir="ltr">This latest adventure is the beginning of something new for the MMO and aims to try something a little different with a number of unpredictable outcomes. You'd be setting yourself up for disappointment if you're expecting this expansion to offer the non-stop excitement and narrative revelations or Shadowbringers or Endwalker, but Dawntrail is still a great setup for a lower-stakes adventure, and one that ultimately makes Dawntrail's twist that much more compelling.</p><p dir

<p>Scarlett Johansson has reflected on her high-profile lawsuit against Disney over the MCU movie Black Widow, saying she does not hold a grudge regarding how it all went down. That's no surprise, after all, as Johansson remains in business with Disney and is producing more content for the company.</p><p>As a refresher, Johansson's team sued Disney over the company's decision to release Black Widow through the Disney+ Premier Access program during the COVID-19 pandemic in July 2021. Johansson's deal with Disney was for the film to be released exclusively in theaters, and when it wasn't, her lawyers argued she was missing out on potentially millions of dollars in backend compensation. Black Widow <em>was </em>released in theaters alongside its Disney+ debut, but it was not a theatrical-exclusive release.</p><p>"I don't hold a grudge," Johansson told <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/13/style/scarlett-johansson-snl-fly-me-to-the-moon.html">The New York Times</a>, as reported by <

He told <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/viggo-mortensen-little-gold-men-awards-insider">Vanity Fair</a> that he has nothing against these types of movies, but finds them to be too predictable and simply not very well-written, so he's avoided them since The Lord of the Rings.</p><p>"I don't really look for or avoid any kind of genre or any size budget. I just look for interesting stories," he said, <a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/news/viggo-mortensen-hollywood-franchises-not-well-written-predictable-1236073906/">as reported by Variety</a>. "It doesn't matter to me what the genre is or what the budget is or who's making them. I would never do a movie just because so-and-so is directing it. It has to be about the story.

<p>Nintendo has announced Emio - The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club, the first new entry in the series in over 30 years, and it will launch for Nintendo Switch on August 29. Last week, Nintendo hinted at the game by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-just-surprise-dropped-the-scariest-game-teaser-of-the-year/1100-6524826/">dropping a spooky teaser.</a></p><p>Once again, the player works as an assistant private investigator with the Utsugi Detective Agency, and must solve the mystery behind the death of a student whose head was covered by a paper bag with a smiling face drawn on it. Eighteen years ago, there were similar incidents with the victims of Emio, the Smiling Man, a killer of urban legend who did the same. Along with returning series protagonist Ayumi Tachibana, the duo will work together to figure out if Emio has returned, or if it's just a copycat crime.</p><p>In 2021, Nintendo released remakes of the first two Famicom Detective Club games: The Missing

<p>A two-year-old is dead after her father left her in a car in 100-degree heat as he was "distracted by playing video games," according to court documents obtained by <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/07/16/arizona-hot-car-death-christopher-scholtes/74431098007/">USA Today</a>.

He told police he "wanted her to remain in the vehicle while she slept," but the air conditioning switched off after 30 minutes, the documents say. Police are now saying the child was left in the vehicle for about three hours at the home in Marana, Arizona.</p><div>          </div><p>Scholtes did not realize he forgot about his daughter until after his wife Erika came back from work a

## Flintlock: The Siege Of Dawn Review - Gunpowder and Deicide

<p>Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn has been marketed as a souls-lite rather than the more common souls-like, which I assumed meant it would be more approachable while still retaining many of the genre's core tenets. This is partly true in that it's nowhere near as punishing as From Software's games, and features familiar elements like bonfire-esque checkpoints and an Estus Flask-style healing system. Yet the game's style is more akin to something like Star Wars: Jedi Survivor than any Dark Souls game. Flintlock feels like a mashup of sensibilities between a souls-like and a more traditional action game, bridging the gap between the two with its own delightful approach to fast-paced combat and high-flying traversal.</p><p dir="ltr">One area in which Flintlock immediately stands out amongst its contemporaries is its unique setting. Mixing magical high fantasy with elements from the 17th to 19th century and the advent of gunpowder, Flintlock's world is immediately intriguing. For your part,

<p dir="ltr">Nintendo deserves and often rightly gets a lot of credit for the proliferation of esports and speedrunning, two competitive video game subcultures that have exploded in recent years. The Nintendo World Championships events were among the first high-profile, publisher-led efforts at esports, and many of the best-known speedrunning records are based on classic NES games. It makes sense, then, that Nintendo would capitalize on its place in history with Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition, a hybrid speedrunning tutorial and ongoing online competition for Nintendo Switch. While the tools are a bit barebones for true speedrun enthusiasts, the presentation nicely preserves and illuminates the joy of racing to shave milliseconds off your best time.</p><p dir="ltr">Nintendo World Championships kicks off on a self-congratulatory tone, having you peruse icons, favorite NES games, and "Hype Tags"--slogans from throughout Nintendo history--to build your profile.
