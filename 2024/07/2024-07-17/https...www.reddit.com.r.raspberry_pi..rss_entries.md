## Why is my RPi 3B+ choking on videos it should be able to play perfectly well?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Howdy, I'm trying to loop a playlist of around 400 short videos using VLC on Raspberry Pi OS Lite (to be clear, there's no desktop environment, I'm running VLC from the command line.) All videos are 1080x1080 h264 at either 30 or 60 fps, and all were encoded with ffmpeg. For some reason, VLC drops basically every single frame on some videos, but it'll happily play other videos just fine even though they're larger and have a higher bitrate. I can't for the life of me figure out what the difference is between these videos such that VLC would have problems with some of them but not others. </p> <p>I did notice that most of the videos that don't play are using the format profile &quot;High 4:4:4 Predictive@L5&quot; while most of the ones that do are using &quot;<a href="mailto:High@L4.2">High@L4.2</a>&quot;, but that doesn't hold true for every video. Also, on the videos that don't play, VLC is constantly spewing the following errors out over and over dur

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have a project running on a RPi5, I have heatsinks and a fan on it. I'm running a April Tag recognition program using a 64MP camera, it's being powered by POE so it has a POE+ hat on it that keeps it pretty cool. The pi is in a CCTV watertight enclosure, so it can get pretty hot. I live in the deep south and It's been running for a few weeks now outside doing ok, but I'm worried what would happen if it overheats and shuts down. It's mounted on a wall about 20ft in the air, and since it's at my work I can't just grab a ladder(big company, safety conscious) and fix it. I've watch it edge into 73-78C territory and we still have about 10-15 degrees of heat to increase here. 105F days are not strange or uncommon. So I'm wondering, if my pi overheats and shuts down, what can I do?</p> <p>Since it's POE+ I think I could just unplug it at the network switch and I think that would work, but I'm looking for a way to automate it. I'm using POE injectors, so ma
