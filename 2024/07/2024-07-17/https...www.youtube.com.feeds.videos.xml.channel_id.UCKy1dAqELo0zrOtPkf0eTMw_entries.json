Building a house is amusing, even if pieces aren\u2019t always cooperative about snapping together in the right orientation. And while the combat is generally pretty basic, the grotesque weirdness of the monsters more than makes up for that, especially when you get a menagerie of weird little creatures of your own to fight with. Once Human would benefit from more creative quests and a flatter difficulty curve, but I still had a great time, and I\u2019m eager to continue my adventures in this twisted world as its first season progresses.\n\n#IGN #Gaming", "id": 884718, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miirZQ9GLV8", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "source_obj__id": 149, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/miirZQ9GLV8/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Once Human Review", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-07-17T23:00:14+00:00", "description": "Concord is a team-based first-person action hero-shooter developed by Firewalk Studios.

This is the Inside Story of a solo Catwoman film that started with Michell Pfeiffer and Tim Burton, and ended over a decade later with Halle Berry on stage, Oscar in hand, accepting a Razzie (and giving an incredible speech, by the way).\n\nInside Stories was produced by Clint Gage and Scott Collura, written by Evan Gaustad and Scott Meslow (yes, just the two of them), edited by Justin Donaldson with graphics ", "id": 881172, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YvMXxtnM3w", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "source_obj__id": 149, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/2YvMXxtnM3w/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "The Night Catwoman Brought Her Oscar To The Razzies | IGN Inside Stories", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-07-17T13:00:56+00:00", "description": "Check out the trailer for Barbie Project Friendship, an upcoming adventure game that follows Barbie \u201cBrooklyn\u201d Roberts, Barbie \u201cMalibu\u201d Roberts, and friends as they restore a run-down community center.\u00a0Explore new areas of the Malibu Waves Community Center, unlock awesome outfits, and take part in a number of fun activities with familiar faces, such as making ice cream with Ken and customizing scooters with Nikki.\n\nBarbie Project Friendship will be released on October 25, 2024 on PS5 (PlayStation 5), Xbox Series X/S, PS4 (PlayStation 4), Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Steam and the Microsoft Store.\n\n#Barbie #Gaming #Games", "id": 880694, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0hpnQ7PE5g", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "source_obj__id": 149, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/w0hpnQ7PE5g/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Barbie Project Friendship - Official Announcement Trailer", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-07-17T13:00:51+00:00", "description": "Get your first look at Robot Entertainment's just-announced Orcs Must Die!
