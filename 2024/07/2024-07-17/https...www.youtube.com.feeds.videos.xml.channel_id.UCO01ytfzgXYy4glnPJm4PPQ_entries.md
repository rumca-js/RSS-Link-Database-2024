Country singer Ingrid Andress drunkenly sang the national anthem at a MLB game recently. Here's what I propose to ensure we never have to witness another failed performance again.

Today on the Matt Walsh Show, many of the corporations and universities that are usually eager to speak up about current events and condemn violence have said nothing at all about the attempted assassination of the leading presidential candidate. Their silence speaks volumes. Also, California passes a law empowering schools to conceal a child's "gender identity" from their parents. Joe Biden speaks to the NAACP and it doesn't go well, of course. Supreme Court term limits could be on the horizon; I'll explain why that's a terrible idea. And, the head of the largest teachers union in the country gives a speech that is equal parts unhinged and meaningless.
