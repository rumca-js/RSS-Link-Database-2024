It&#8217;s a whole new edition of Age of Sigmar which means a few things: veteran players assume rules that aren&#8217;t there any more, new players are confused by the confusion of veteran players, and for a few months everyone is figuring what&#8217;s good or not. If you haven&#8217;t seen, we&#8217;ve already covered a lot about the new edition [&#8230;]

Over the years the Goonhammer crew have put together a vast and expansive library of painting guides. Appropriately titled “How to Paint Everything” we’ve got schemes and recipes for 100s of models.
