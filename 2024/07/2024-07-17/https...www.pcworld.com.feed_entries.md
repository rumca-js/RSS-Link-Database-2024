<p>Although Amazon Prime Day is coming to a close, there&rsquo;s still time to pick up an epic 4K (!!!) monitor at a reasonable price point. Right now, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Philips-279P1-Power-saving-PowerSensor-Replacement/dp/B08KFLY9DQ/">Philips Brilliance 279P1 monitor is on sale for $200</a>, which is a savings of $50 (20% off) the original $250 price.</p>



<p>In addition to the 4K resolution (perfect for video editors and movie buffs), this monitor also measures 27 inches (a great size for a home office) and comes with built-in speakers as well as a four-year warranty. </p>



<p>So, why should you listen to anything I say? That&rsquo;s a valid question! I spend a lot of time hunting down deals. Not only do I oversee PCWorld&rsquo;s laptop section, but I also maintain our <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/550968/best-laptop-deals-3.html"

<p>Earlier this year, industry analysts were predicting a huge rise in flash storage prices. That doesn&rsquo;t seem to have happened because Amazon&rsquo;s Prime Day is offering some seriously tempting deals on SSDs.</p>



<p>You can check out <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2393110/best-prime-day-ssd-storage-deals-july-2024.html">our full roundup of Prime Day SSD deals</a>, but I wanted to highlight <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Silicon-Power-UD90-NVMe-SP04KGBP44UD9005/dp/B0BYN8NHXS/">this Silicon Power Gen4 drive</a>: <strong>4TB of storage for just $204</strong>. That&rsquo;s an absolutely incredible price for a gigantic drive. (Figuratively gigantic, as this M.2 2280 drive is only 80mm long.)</p>



<p>While Gen4x4 PCIe isn&rsquo;t the newest or fastest storage in the world, its 5,000MB/s rating is more than fast enough for demanding gamers and most

<p>As Amazon Prime Day winds down, now is still a great time to pick up a premium laptop at a big discount. And if you&rsquo;ve been shopping around for such a laptop without striking gold yet, you&rsquo;re in luck.</p>



<p>The Samsung Galaxy Book4 Pro is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Processor-Touchscreen-NP940XGK-KG1US-Moonstone/dp/B0CQ3RRS23/">on sale for $1,150 at Amazon</a>, which is 21% off its original cost of $1,450. This is an excellent price for a laptop with an Intel Core 7 Ultra processor and a 3K (2880&times;1800) OLED touchscreen display. Plus, we love the Galaxy Book line of laptops because they&rsquo;re such elegant, lightweight machines.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re as attached to having multiple monitors as I am, then you certainly feel like you can&rsquo;t really do your job when it&rsquo;s only you and your laptop. Thankfully, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ARZOPA-Portable-Kickstand-High-end-Entertainment/dp/B0CH9WLFTP">Arzopa 16.1&Prime; portable monitor is down to a fantastic $86 this Prime Day</a>.</p>

<p>Listen, I probably have more power banks than I actually need because my phone&rsquo;s battery is lousy, but this <a href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-25000mAh-Portable-Charging-Compatible/dp/B0BJQ7F16T/">Ugreen 25000mAh model</a> is by far my favorite because it has enough juice to top off my phone a few times over and I can even share a cable with others around me if need be. Now that it&rsquo;s only $76 for Prime members, down from the regular $120, it&rsquo;s the perfect purchase.</p>



<p>I&rsquo;ve been in tech media for 12 years at this point, many of them spent hunting down the best deals, so I know a good deal when I see one. This Ugreen discount is downright impressive. </p>
