I understand that there are self-hosted BaaS options like Appwrite and Supabase, which have their own managed cloud versions with pricing. But PocketBase's main appeal is that it's a self-hosted, one-file backend solution for your next project. With services like elest.io and pockethost.io offering managed PocketBase, I'm curious why people would opt for these when it's possible to set up your own server at a lower cost, taking less than half an hour to set up.

I have gone through almost all the blogs and GitHub repos out there. None of them seem to be working while trying to connect from an iPhone (or any device). I don't want an OpenVPN server. Would love to host a VPN which can accept connections from multiple devices simulteneously.</p> <p>Any help is appreciated. Thanks.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ashishmeher777\"> /u/ashishmeher777 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1e5ac4f/how_to_set_up_and_selfhost_a_vpn_on_an_ec2/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1e5ac4f/how_to_set_up_and_selfhost_a_vpn_on_an_ec2/\">[comments]</a></span>", "id": 878743, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1e5ac4f/how_to_set_up_and_selfhost_a_vpn_on_an_ec2", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/.rss", "source_obj__id": 450, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "How to set up and selfhost a VPN on an EC2 instance (ubuntu)?", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-07-17T03:53:53+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>This server is running Proxmox, but I've found a weird issue.
