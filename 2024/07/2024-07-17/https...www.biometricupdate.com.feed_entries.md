		The <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202404/biometric-face-image-quality-standard-draft-released-along-with-assessment-tool">Open Source Face Image Quality</a> (OFIQ) project, led by the German Federal Office for Information Security, has published a preliminary report detailing its evaluation methodology. The report outlines crucial steps and approaches to ensuring the algorithms' accuracy and dependability for measuring biometric image quality.

The software library is a reference implementation of the ISO/IEC 29794-5 international standard. The development and assessment of the OFIQ algorithms were conducted in two phases – initial implementation and assessment, followed by refinement and enhancement.

During the initial phase, the initial algorithms were impl

		Google Wallets are expanding from payments and biometric ID documents like mobile driver’s licenses and passports to “Everything else.”

An APK (Android Application Package) teardown by <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-wallet-everything-else-apk-3460569/">Android Authority</a> reveals plans to include automatic identification, scanning and storage of a wide range of ID credentials and other documents in Google Wallet. The “Everything else” option allows scans of documents the user specifies as normal or private. Normal ones, like student IDs and business cards, do not require authentication to be saved or accessed, but private documents such as tax IDs and other government issued credentials will require biometric authentication.

		Biometrics testing is a rapidly maturing field, but there is more to effective identity verification than an accurate matching algorithm, Dr. Chris Allgrove, director and co-founder of <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/ingenium-biometrics">Ingenium Biometric Laboratories</a> explained during a presentation for the EAB. The Lunch Talk “<a href="https://eab.org/events/past_events.html?ts=1721228892224">Exploring the Spectrum of Identity Verification Technology Testing</a>” delved into the standards used in IDV testing and the gaps between them.

Allgrove began by defining identity verification and its primary function of binding an individual and their identity evidence. He reviewed the standards and processes around identity document authentication,

		<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/youverse">Youverse</a> has announced a fourfold improvement in its <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/biometric-news/liveness-detection">liveness detection</a> capabilities. The company boasts that the update aims to upgrade the liveness detection software to differentiate between real human users and digital impersonation attempts.

Youverse says it uses algorithms capable of passively analyzing facial features to confirm the presence of a real user's identity in real-time, in a bid to reduce the likelihood of false acceptances of fraudulent biometric data.

“This significant increase in liveness performance is a testament to Youverse’s relentless pursuit of excellence in biometric security,” says Miguel Lourenço, co-f

		The <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/the-age-verification-providers-association">Age Verification Provider’s Association</a> (AVPA) has issued an extensive response to the UK regulator’s consultation on “Protecting children from harms online,” the second of the key Codes of Practice which will inform the framework for how children will be protected from illegal activity under the Online Safety Act 2023.

In a <a href="https://avpassociation.com/consultation-response/avpa-responds-to-ofcom-consultation/">statement</a> published on its website, AVPA says Ofcom’s language on so-called “highly effective age assurance” is too vague, and that the regulator has failed to answer calls from Parliament to implement age assurance che

		A London district known for its Victorian architecture and the home stadium of Arsenal Football Club has called for the police to stop deploying live facial recognition (LFR) on its grounds.

Last week, the Islington Borough Council rejected the Metropolitan Police’s use of live facial recognition, becoming the third council in London to do so after Haringey and Newham.

“Islington Council does not support the use of Live Facial Recognition (LFR) technology and are calling on the Mayor of London to ask that the Metropolitan Police, Transport for London and the other agencies he is responsible for refrain from using LFR technologies within the borough,” it said in a statement.

		In a wave of data breaches over the last year, several organizations have carelessly exposed large troves of sensitive personal information, heightening fears of identity theft and fraud. In a step further than exposed data, <a href="https://www.404media.co/inside-the-face-fraud-factory/">404 Media</a> recently uncovered an underground site that sells videos and photos of real people to pass some biometric KYC checks for online services. The investigation reveals that these faces are being sold on the dark web and used to commit various forms of financial and identity fraud.

Fraudsters sometimes pay individuals to take photos and videos they can sell to others to carry out attacks, 404 reports, possibly in combination with fake ID document creation services like the

		Voice deepfake attacks capable of fooling call center agents, automated systems, employees and loved ones have spiked this year, with dramatic increases in the availability and quality of voice-spoofing tools, <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/pindrop">Pindrop</a> Founder and CEO Vijay Balasubramaniyan told <em>Biometric Update </em>in an interview. This is the context behind $100 million in debt financing secured by Pindrop from Hercules Capital to scale its customer base for deepfake detection and voice biometrics.

The funds will also be used to develop liveness and voice recognition tools for a widening range of industries, as deepfakes are deployed to commit fraud in more scenarios.
