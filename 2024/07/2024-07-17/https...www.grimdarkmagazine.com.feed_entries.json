As the novel opens, two starships are in orbit around a black hole known as QV Tel. Although the crews have been sent to gather data near the event horizon of the black hole, they are suffering from severe physical and psychological trauma after traveling near the speed of light. The journey takes an especially large toll on one of the starship captains, Alpha Raine, who suffers a complete psychological breakdown, murdering his crew. While others question his sanity, Raine believes he is receiving communication from a being that resides within the black hole itself. Raine undergoes evaluation by Saccade, the other lead character of Lake of Darkness, a historian of twentieth century Earth culture specializing in the psychology of serial killers. The title of the novel is an allusion to King Lear by William Shakespear", "id": 878414, "language": "en-AU", "link": "https://www.grimdarkmagazine.com/review-lake-of-darkness-by-adam-roberts", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.grimdarkmagazine.com/feed", "source_obj__id": 137, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "REVIEW: Lake of Darkness by Adam Roberts", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
