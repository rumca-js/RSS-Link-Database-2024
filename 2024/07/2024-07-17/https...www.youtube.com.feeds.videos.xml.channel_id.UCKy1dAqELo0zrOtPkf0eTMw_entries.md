Once Human reviewed by Justin Koreis on PC.

Once Human is a lot of fun, with survival-crafting that is simple and accessible, but still rewarding to dig into. Building a house is amusing, even if pieces aren’t always cooperative about snapping together in the right orientation. And while the combat is generally pretty basic, the grotesque weirdness of the monsters more than makes up for that, especially when you get a menagerie of weird little creatures of your own to fight with. Once Human would benefit from more creative quests and a flatter difficulty curve, but I still had a great time, and I’m eager to continue my adventures in this twisted world as its first season progresses.

Emmerich, writer and producer Robert Rodat, series lead actor Iwan Rheon, and so many more.
Those About to Die is an epic drama set in the corrupt world of the spectacle-driven gladiatorial
competition, exploring a side of ancient Rome never before told — the dirty business of
entertaining the masses, giving the mob what they want most…blood and sport. The series
introduces an ensemble of characters from all corners of the Roman Empire who collide at the
explosive intersection of sports, politics, and dynasties.

Watch or listen to Rise or Die wherever you get your podcasts, and check out Those About To

Twisters, reviewed by Siddhant Adlakha. Narrated by Mark Medina.
Twisters has charm for days, even if it doesn’t slow down long enough to let us get to know the characters better. Thankfully, stars Glen Powell, Daisy Edgar-Jones, and Anthony Ramos bring plenty of personality to the film through their performances. With scenes of natural disaster grounded in a human point of view, Lee Isaac Chung's spiritual sequel transcends its visual shortcomings, and proves to be a wildly fun and effective summer blockbuster worth watching on the biggest and loudest screen.

When Halle Berry won an Oscar for Monster’s Ball it was an historic night. Less than 2 years later when she won a Razzie for Catwoman it was… well it was something else. Looking at Catwoman 20 years on, it’s hard to see anything other than the messy and confusing DC spin off, but the film of course didn’t set out to be bad. We talked to the face of the film, Halle Berry, along with a handful of the many, MANY writers that took a stab at adapting Catwoman for the big screen to find out just what went wrong, how the studio system is built and what development hell really looks like. This is the Inside Story of a solo Catwoman film that started with Michell Pfeiffer and Tim Burton, and ended over a decade later with Halle Berry on stage, Oscar in hand, accepting a Razzie (and giving an incredible speech, by the way).

Inside Stories was produced by Clint Gage and Scott Collura, written by Evan Gaustad and Scott Meslow (yes, just the two of them), edited by Justin Donaldson with graphics
