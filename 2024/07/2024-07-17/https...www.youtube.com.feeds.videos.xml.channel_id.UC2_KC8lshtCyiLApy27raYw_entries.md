We use smartphones a lot. Too much some may even argue. Over the past decade or so they’ve become more or less a necessity in society.

But they necessarily…need to be, right?

As time goes on, people have become content with older phones. No need to upgrade every year, and in response big tech had a plan.

Replace the smartphone with VR headsets, and AR headset. And smart glasses.

To you this might seem bizarre and nonsensical, but to somebody, somewhere, it all made sense.

Today I want to take a look at how I feel this experiment has failed, and explore why headsets will never replace the smartphone.
