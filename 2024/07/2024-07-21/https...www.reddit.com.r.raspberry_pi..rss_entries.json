The disc just keeps spinning in the device and the Raspberry Pi just never recgonizes it. Now as far as I know, I am pretty sure the problem is just not enough power, so I wanted to come here and just see before I buy anything if this solution will work and the Raspberry Pi will recognize the disc drive. So, for context, I am making a project that will be using a internal CD-ROM drive that I was going to originally plug into the Raspberry Pi just via a SATA to USB adapter, but now with this new power issue, I have thought if maybe the cable linked below would work, since it has it's own power supply and also uses USB to connect to the computer. Also note that the same problem that I am having on Raspberry Pi OS I am also having on WoR (Windows on Raspberry).
