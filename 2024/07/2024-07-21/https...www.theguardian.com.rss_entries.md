The jury is out on whether it is retribution, rehabilitation or protecting the public. But in recent years, with a more complex understanding of mental health, addiction and the criminalisation of poverty, its role in supposedly civilised society has been called into question. While Tory cabinet after Tory cabinet has forged the path of more punitive sentences, many people – myself included – have been questioning the purpose of increasing mass incarceration. Many of us have been calling for a shift towards a more Scandinavian model, which would abandon the rampant overpopulation of our prisons and shift the focus on to helping criminals to become fully contributing members of their communities. It’s a particularly relevant question given that, within days of

<p>The critic leaves no thought unturned in a personal, interrogative exploration of the life and work of a much-mythologised musician</p><p>“I am not a biographer, in the usual definition of that term,” Ann Powers writes in her introduction to <em>Travelling</em>, describing herself instead as “a critic, a kind of mapmaker”. Her book follows Joni Mitchell’s trail across eight decades, mapping out not just the artist’s singular musical journey, but her misjudgments, musical and otherwise, in a discursive narrative that is peppered with critical theory and personal self-questioning.</p><p>“I had to keep uprooting myself, rejecting any settled stances about who this woman is and why her music is so special,” Powers says of her often interrogative approach. Her authorial presence, often illuminating, but sometimes distracting, is the defining undercurrent throughout, which means some passages have the feel of someone thinking out loud as they grapple with the more problematic aspects of

<p>Halfway through her 18,200-mile journey, Lael Wilcox calls in (from her bike) to talk about being in the saddle for 14 hours a day – and why she has no intention of stopping any time soon</p><p>“I’m not in pain, which is unusual!” laughs ultra-distance cyclist <a href="https://www.laelwilcox.net/">Lael Wilcox</a> over a patchy WhatsApp call from somewhere in rural Serbia. She is almost a month into an attempt to be the fastest woman to circumnavigate the globe on a bicycle and, despite being able to follow her mile-by-mile progress online, it’s surprisingly hard to track down and actually talk to the 36-year-old Alaskan.</p><p>When we finally do speak, I expect her to call from a hotel, or between mouthfuls of porridge at a roadside café. But when she comes on the line, a little out of breath, with the occasional sound of passing cars, she is clearly in-saddle, on the road and heading east. “I’m on my bike!” she laughs gleefully, noting how she aims to cover just under 190 miles by

<p>2012 canoeing champion highlights parallels between sport and activism, and the urgency of the climate crisis</p><p>‘When the door closes on the police cell and you’re in there on your own, you start to think,” Etienne Stott says as the London 2012 Olympic gold medallist reflects on the times his environmental activism has resulted in him being arrested and briefly incarcerated. “Each time, while using my platform to communicate, I’ve sat in the cell and thought: ‘What if everyone hates me and thinks what I’ve done is so disgusting they don’t want to talk to me?’ That’s a horrible thing.</p><p>“But then you hold the faith and say: ‘You’re doing the right thing. You’ve got to see it through.’ It’s like Olympic training. You go through tough times and being in that cell, and out in the media, is the other half of my work. Thousands of people undertake non-violent direct action and are arrested. These forms of protest are a desperate form of communication to shine a light on the issue

<p>It’s grassroots, collective action – rarely commemorated – that pushed women’s rights forward</p><p>I looked first for the house in London where, in 1855, Barbara Leigh Smith hosted the first meeting of the campaign for married women’s property rights. A petition to change the law decreeing that husbands owned everything marked the start of her lobbying career. But Blandford Square was remodelled when Marylebone station was built, and the building is long gone.</p><p>Then I tried Langham Place near Oxford Circus. Here a plaque marks the site of the Queen’s Hall, destroyed in the blitz, while another commemorates a dinner attended by Oscar Wilde.

<p>True, she only has one joke, but it’s an absolute banger</p><p>My two-year-old daughter only has one joke, but it’s a banger. She usually deploys it when I’m at my wit’s end – an alarmingly frequent condition – and it catches me off guard every time. I’ll be pouring pasta from pot to colander, or scrubbing Weetabix from a wall, and will look over to see her ambling towards me wearing my giant shoes on her absurdly small feet. In fact, since they’re high-tops, they come up well past her knees, causing both of us to laugh ourselves senseless.</p><p>It’s good she’s mastered comedy, because it leavens the more irascible aspects of her character. She doesn’t respond to the disciplinary strategies we used with her older brother, who was always placatable after a few warnings.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/article/2024/jul/21/my-two-year-old-daughter-has-a-great-sense-of-humour">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As the career of the pioneering writer is remembered, an 1688 copy of her novel Oroonoko is the cherry on the cake</p><p>The striking name of the playwright and novelist Aphra Behn, pioneering queen of English literature, remains largely unrecognised outside academia and the theatre. But this summer, almost 400 years after her birth, Behn’s talents are being celebrated, and especially in her home town of Canterbury. Her extraordinary and mysterious career is being marked by a Netflix film, a statue, a revived play and – the cherry on the cake – by the discovery of a rare first edition 1688 copy of her most famous novel, <em>Oroonoko</em>.</p><p>Studied in schools and universities, <em>Oroonoko</em> is the story of an enslaved African prince in the Guianas in the colonial era and is the earliest fictional chronicle of these experiences written in English. He is tricked onto a ship that takes him to Suriname, where he leads an abortive uprising and is violently punished. The story is

It’s an intense relationship, poised on the brink of change, with Lacy’s adolescence lurking just around the corner.</p><p>But it’s this sense of precious transience that makes <em>Janet Planet</em>, the feature debut of Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Annie Baker, such an exquisite and treasurable account of a complicated mother-daughter bond.

<p>Balls, bikes, possibly boredom. As the summer holidays begin, and nostalgia for the good old days kicks in, it’s worth wondering if it really was better back then</p><p>As the school holidays begin, parents tend to behave in one of two ways. The first is to pray, not to God or the universe, but to time itself, begging it for some leniency, a bit of give. Please time, this year please stretch and fold around our external pressures and internal needs. You will recognise these parents by their blank white eyes and empty pockets, and skin that ripples then turns grey across the long month of August.</p><p>The second type of parent (I say parent, I’m being coy, of course, we’re talking about mothers here) runs at the summer as if she’s in a sanitary-pad commercial or attacking a bear. She has plans, schedules, craft materials, hope. The holidays for her are an opportunity for self-discovery and existential relaxation, for resetting the mind and reclaiming the soul, even during fractured

<p>Streamlining your outfits and reducing excess clutter is the main aim with packing. So where is the best place to start?</p><p>Ask yourself what you need from your clothes. Is it a beach or city break? Do you need a smarter outfit or is that just-in-case evening dress really taking up valuable space and can be left behind?

A sun hat you can roll, (1, below) or a baseball cap are more useful than a wide-brim hat that will get battered in transit.</p><p>Always pack a tote bag for supermarket runs or souvenir shopping sprees.

Polar bears had been introduced to the zoo in 1988, first Gus, and then his two female companions, Ida and Lily. Gus, in particular, became the zoo’s star turn, seen by 20 million people before his death in 2013. He achieved particular fame a couple of years after this picture was taken when he started compulsively swimming in a figure of eight pattern for hours at a time.</p><p>The mystery drew reporters from around the world, and prompted editorials about the frustrations of captivity. Gus was depicted as a typical New Yorker, fretful, neurotic, depressive, a symbol of the city. There was a book, <em

<p>Helen Pitcher has shown no contrition for the failings of the watchdog, which blundered in the case of Andrew Malkinson</p><p>Our criminal justice system is rightly loaded in favour of letting those who are probably guilty walk free to avoid locking up the innocent for crimes they did not commit.

<p>Long, bittersweet drinks are just the ticket for hot summer days</p><p><strong>Cotswolds Summer Cup, England (£20, <a href="http://majestic.co.uk/">majestic.co.uk</a>) </strong>In the manner of John Major’s sentimental Orwell-referencing hymn to an English summer, with its warm beer, bicycling old maids and long shadows on county grounds, we can all reel off a list of sights, sounds and smells that together mean that the summer holidays have truly begun. My own might include, the synthetic-floral whiff of Nivea sun cream, the sound of bass-heavy music emerging from open-top cars, and the early-evening sighting of a tall cool glass filled with that most summery, and most broadly defined of beverages: the long drink. In England, the paradigmatic long drink (warm beer aside) is probably Pimm’s, complete with its salad-bar garnishes. But other, and in my opinion, better examples of the gin-based “summer cup” mix are available, not least the maximally bittersweetly refreshing concoction
