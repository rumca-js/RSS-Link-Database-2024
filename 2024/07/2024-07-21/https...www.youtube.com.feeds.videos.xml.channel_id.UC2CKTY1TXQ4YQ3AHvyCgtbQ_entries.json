I'll talk about how to get started in kitbashing and how to think about going about it - and of course, I'll answer your wargaming and hobby questions. Come have fun!\n\nVince Venturella and I made another game! Check out Deth Wizards at http://www.dethwizardsgame.com\n\nI'm now a partner on Twitch! I paint minis every Friday morning and Monday night, and sometimes take paint breaks (play video games poorly).
