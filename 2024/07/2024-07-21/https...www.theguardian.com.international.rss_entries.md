## Biden’s withdrawal from the 2024 race: our panelists’ reactions

<p>The president withdrew from the race at a late stage. Our panelists weigh in on where the election could go from here</p><p>It was the right move. Joe Biden’s dropping out of the race at this late stage is unprecedented and risky. The risks of a Trump presidency are far higher, though. The president was in a position where winning was incredibly unlikely, floundering in the polls, facing a major revolt from his party, and unable to fix the critical concern voters have - his age. A move to a candidate in Kamala Harris who can forcefully make the case against Donald Trump, barnstorm the country, do town halls and press conferences, and inject energy into the political moment offers Democrats a chance to catch up and beat Trump.</p><p>Ben Davis works in political data in Washington, DC</p><p>Richard Wolffe is a Guardian US columnist</p><p>Lloyd Green is an attorney in New York</p><p>Osita Nwanevu is a Guardian US columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article

It started 130 years ago. Its wrappers are beautifully colourful – a full spectrum of the bars would make a lovely present – and they somehow look just like chocolate bars should.</p><p>It is possibly the chocolate most often recommended to me. Readers from around the world send me pictures of it, saying, ‘Have you tried this? It’s amazing.’ I’ve recommended it before, –and it’s worth recommending but here’s a secret: I don’t love-love it. The most recent bar I tried, the 65% <a href="https://bonnat-chocolatier.com/fr/e-shop/tablettes/tablettes-grands-crus-lait/chocolat-grandanse">Grand’Anse</a> from Haiti, £6.95/100g, caused an outburst of, ‘Oh, wow this is amazing,’ in my testers.

But by the time he won Sweden a gold medal in the 2004 Olympics, he had honed himself into the perfect projectile. It was the result of a 15-year obsession: his whole life had been pulled into alignment with this goal. If he wanted to stop on page 225 of a book, he would push himself to page 240, in order to train his mind to overshoot. “It’s all about your 10,000,” he told David Epstein, author of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/aug/22/sports-gene-david-epstein-review"><em>The Sports Gene</em></a>.
