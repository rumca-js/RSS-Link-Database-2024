The Nintendo Entertainment System aka Famicom previously held the record at 2,686 days and with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a> still to arrive, the current-gen hybrid continues to power on.

In the first of a series of pieces, we're taking stock with our picks for the most technologi

At the same time, a huge hand with inhumanly long fingers is caressing the face of a dead child.

Warframe's been fully embracing its weird side over the course of its last couple of expansions, but if you thought its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digital-extremes-talks-the-duviri-paradox-warframes-weirdest-expansion-yet">mood-world westerns</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warframes-big-weird-whispers-in-the-walls-expansion-out-in-december-with-cross-save">long-lost dimension-shifting labs</a> were as far as the free-to-play shooter was willing to go, then you might want to brace yourself: developer Digital Extremes has shared first gameplay of its upcoming 1999 story expansion and, well, let's just say you get to go into space to kill a 90s boyband.
