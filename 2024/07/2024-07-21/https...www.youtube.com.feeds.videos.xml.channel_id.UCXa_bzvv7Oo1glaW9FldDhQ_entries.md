Star Wars Outlaws is set to offer a very different kind of experience from what Massive Entertainment has traditionally been known for with The Division, which means the studio will have looked outward for inspiration for several aspects of its upcoming open world title. 

And when it comes to the storytelling aspects in particular, there’s plenty that Star Wars Outlaws could learn from Electronic Arts’ Star Wars Jedi series about what minimum bar of quality to hit as a modern AAA story driven single player Star Wars game- even if, from a gameplay perspective, Outlaws is going to be quite different from the Jedi games. With the open world title out soon, here, we talk about all of that and more.

Nobody Wants to Die is a narrative adventure game that takes place in its own cyberpunk setting that borrows heavily from heavyweights in the genre like Altered Carbon. Despite its inspirations being obvious, however, Nobody Wants to Die offers up an original story with a murder mystery in a world where dying is very difficult.

While there’s not much in the way of gameplay in Nobody Wants to Die, the game instead plays like a point-and-click adventure game, where players will end up using their various tools to uncover the mysteries and secrets behind various crime scenes. 

All of this is backed up with strong writing and downright gorgeous visuals that bring the world of Nobody Wants to Die to life.

Combat is the most common verb in video games- that’s been true for as long as games have existed, and that’s probably not going to change anytime soon. That, of course, means that there’s been no shortage of games that have boasted incredible combat over the decades.

Here, we are going to talk about what we feel are fifteen more games with some of the best and more addictive combat we have ever seen in games, from turn based RPGs to sidescrolling games, from third person shooters to superhero epics, and more.
