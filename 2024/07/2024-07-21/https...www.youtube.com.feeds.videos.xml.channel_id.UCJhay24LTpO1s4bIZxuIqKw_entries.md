Safer C++ with MISRA-C++-2023 - Peter Sommerlad - ACCU 2024
---

MISRA guidelines and corresponding static analysis tooling exist to foster programming practices that are considered important for safety-critical systems, especially in the automotive industry.

In application areas where human lives or capital is at risk, safe and secure code is a must, but even in other domains the internal quality of C++ programs is an important factor for programmers' effectiveness. Adhering to MISRA-C++ can help to achieve better internal quality, reducing the risk of undefined behavior and portability issues through implementation-defined behavior.

Since the original MISRA-C++:2008 guidelines that addressed C++03, five new C++ standards were released. While inherently conservative, an update to the MISRA-C++ guidelines was prepared and is released in 2023 addressing C++17.

This talk will give an overview of why and what MISRA-C++:2023 attempts t
