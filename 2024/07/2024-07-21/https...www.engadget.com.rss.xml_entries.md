<p>Somehow in all these years, I’ve never gotten into visual novels, despite being a person who loves both reading and video games. The idea has always intrigued me in some way, but I’ve never really felt compelled to actually pick one up. That changed when I first saw the announcement for <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://play.date/games/echoes-of-emergent/"><em><ins>Echoes of the Emergent</ins></em></a> a few months ago. Described as “a personal journey through a shattered post-apocalyptic world,” all it took was a glimpse of <em>Echoes of the Emergent</em>’s gritty aesthetic and melancholic atmosphere to get me to preorder it.

<p>Engineers from Boeing and NASA have spent much of the last month running ground tests on a Starliner Reaction Control System (RCS) thruster to get a better idea of what went wrong during the active Starliner’s flight in early June, and they finally wrapped up this past week. In its latest update, <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://starlinerupdates.com/starliner-thruster-ground-testing-complete-data-reviews-underway/"><ins>Boeing</ins></a> said the teams were able to replicate the thrust degradation Starliner experienced and are now reviewing all the data. But <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/starliner-astronauts-return-trip-has-been-pushed-back-even-further-174336571.html">the date of astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams’ return</a> is still uncertain — NASA and Boeing said only that they’ll be making the trip “in the coming weeks.”</p>
