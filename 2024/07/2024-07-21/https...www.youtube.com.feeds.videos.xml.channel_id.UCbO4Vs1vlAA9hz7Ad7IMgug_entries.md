It's into the UNDERHELLS. Loved Space Hulk? Love Aliens? Want to pit a suicide-squad of Gangers against an endless nightmare horde of aliens in the ruins of a Dead hive as they seek to confront and kill the monstrous Brood-Father lurking there? Let's dive into Hive Secundus, the one-off game mode expansion and two-player game box from the Boxed Game team at Games Workshop.
 
Thanks to GW for the copy of the Box to review.
