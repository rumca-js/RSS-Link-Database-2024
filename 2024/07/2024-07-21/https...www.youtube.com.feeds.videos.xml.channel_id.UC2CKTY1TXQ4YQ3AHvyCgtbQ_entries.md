Kitbashing models is probably the most creative part of the wargaming hobby - and it's one of my favorite aspects. I'll talk about how to get started in kitbashing and how to think about going about it - and of course, I'll answer your wargaming and hobby questions. Come have fun!

Vince Venturella and I made another game! Check out Deth Wizards at http://www.dethwizardsgame.com

I'm now a partner on Twitch! I paint minis every Friday morning and Monday night, and sometimes take paint breaks (play video games poorly). Follow me: http://www.twitch.tv/tabletopminions
