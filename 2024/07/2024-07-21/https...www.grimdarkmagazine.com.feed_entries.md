<p>Abigail is a 2024 slasher movie that is full of twists and turns regarding its titular character. It is full of likable characters, an interesting setting for the murders, and a lot of new takes on a very traditional monster archetype. Abigail, unfortunately, blows its chief surprise in the trailer and it is something that I can&#8217;t imagine would be kept under wraps for most audiences but would improve the film tremendously if you don&#8217;t know it. It&#8217;s still worth seeing if you have been spoiled and I had a lot of fun knowing the &#8220;twist&#8221; from the beginning but my nieces, who didn&#8217;t know, had their enjoyment magnified a huge amount. So, if possible, read this review and take friends to see this movie or show it without spoiling it. But if not, don&#8217;t worry about it. The spoiler that isn&#8217;t really a spoiler if you&#8217;ve heard anything about this movie, really, is that it is a film about a bunch of low-life criminals abducting a little girl
