		Two important arms of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) failed to protect personally identifiable information (PII) and sensitive law enforcement training curricula, potentially putting more than 37,000 DHS and other federal law enforcement officers’ names, social security numbers, dates of births, genders, ranks, titles, and biometric information at risk to being compromised and exploited.

Also at risk are the PII of law enforcement officers and agents from state, local, tribal, campus, international, and 90 partner organizations which potentially could number in the hundreds of thousands.

The problems surfaced during an ongoing audit of “urgent cybersecurity issues” within DHS performed by the office of DHS’s Inspector General (IG), Joseph Cuffari.

There can’t be financial inclusion without digital identity inclusion. Yet, the <a href="https://blogs.worldbank.org/en/digital-development/850-million-people-globally-dont-have-id-why-matters-and-what-we-can-do-about">World Bank</a> estimates, approximately 850 million people across the world do not have an official ID, let alone
