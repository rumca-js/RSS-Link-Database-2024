We play almost everyday. First, I realized that your chances greatly increase by finding questions that split the possibilities in half. I could not find physical features that accomplish this. I found it's more efficient to focus on the letters in their names. There's 24 characters and 11 have the letter E the their names so that should be your opening question. If they have a E then your selections are reduced to 11. The next question is subjective but 5 of the 11 have a bulbous nose. If you want to be safe. Ask if there's an A in their name. That will reduce the number from 11 to 7. </p> <p>Anyway, the strategy is easy to memorize and apply.

Fairly new to the game and an issue came up in our last game. When using a golden token to purchase a card, can it be used as a joker for ANY gem/pearl, even if you don\u2019t own it? Or do you need to have at least a gem or card of the colour you plan on using? Example: I want to buy a card that requires 3 red and 1 pearl, I have 3 red but no pearl, could I use it to substitute the pearl? Example 2: I want to buy a card that requires 2 red. I only have a red card, but no red gems, can I use the gold token to reach 2 red, or is it not possible since I have no gems in that colour? I hope I explained myself properly!

I'm looking for some print and play board games that I could whip out and try out on an upcoming game night with friends? They always bring the coolest games but I can't afford/dare experiment with new, expensive games!</p> <p>We have played a lot of games together, some we loved are: - Settlers of Catan - Carcassone - Terraforming Mars - Bandido (my personal favorite, but because it's Co-op and I'm an ass people don't like playing it with me :(. I'm not intentionally bad at the game, I'm just dumb) - Sniper Elite - Scout (we like every oink game in general) - Cascadia</p> <p>I'm not looking neccessarily for long games, I'm just interested in what you - seasoned veterans - like! </p> <p>Have an Amazing day, everyone!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Bambuloid\"> /u/Bambuloid </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1e8lsc6/any_fun_print_n_play_board_games_for_", "id": 903189, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1e8lsc6/any_fun_print_n_play_board_games_for_2_or_more", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/.rss", "source_obj__id": 473, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Any fun Print n' Play board games for 2 or more players?", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-07-21T12:53:10+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I\u2019ve never sleeved any of my games but I\u2019m planning on Trails being one of my go to camping/outside games as I am so in love with Parks, so I was wondering if anyone with it knows if it will still fit into the regular box with sleeves?
