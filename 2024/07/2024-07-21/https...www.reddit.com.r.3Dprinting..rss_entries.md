Since a lot has happened to make me question if I can trust her. I've been seeing a lot about how dangerous having a resin printer in your home is over the last couple months, let alone in your freaking bedroom. I'm so concerned and it's such a niche topic I don't know who to ask about it. To make in clear she's never actually ran the thing in the bedroom, but there is resin just sitting in the printer. I don't think I've ever been able to smell the resin and I think I would have noticed because it's such a particular smell. Anyway I've read it doesn't even matter because it isn't properly sealed in the printer. Anyone with more experience have anything to say about it? I think 3D printing is super cool and appreciate it, but I'm messed up over this.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/fae

Currently we print mostly PLA, and the only printer that could maybe print ABS is our Dremel 3D45 that uses non standard .75kg spools.</p> <p>Trying to figure out what to do with all this ABS filament... theoretically we could wind the filament on spools that work with our Dremel printer or buy a new printer where it would work better. I am not sure how toxic/smelly ABS is, or if we <em>should</em> use it in a high school setting where we don't have good ventilation though. If we don't use it, I guess we could try sell it on craigslist or something?

It was a nice donation, but I wish it had been PLA.</p> <p>UPDATE #2: I just checked Craigslist to see what ABS might be going for on there, and saw these exact

## Thinking of "giving up" and buying a Bambu

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I bought an Ender 3 back in 2019 and have modded it a ton, bigtree board, quiet steppers, custom firmware, octopi, I even custom designed my own direct drive &amp; cooler system in Fusion 3D and for the longest time it ran better than most high end $1k printers. However, slowly over time it feels like my printer is just losing accuracy and I just don't have time to troubleshoot anymore.</p> <p>I am grateful that I have learned so much by going the Ender 3 route and I've actually enjoyed the struggle exemplified in the memes of &quot;I'm tuning my printer so that I can tune my printer&quot; rather than just having a printer to print things. I'm sure if I sat down on a Saturday and spent the whole day I could tune it back up to its former glory but I also have just run out of time and patience as I've gotten older, I've had a kid, etc... I've moved on to other hobbies as well.</p> <p>Part of me feels like it's &quot;giving up&quot; to go off the shelf c
