<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am new at web scraping, but am working on a project to do some scraping from a governmental website for some of their administrative rules. I am using Scrapy. Although, my issue arose as I was just trying to figure out how I wanted to parse it. </p> <p>I used Scrapy Shell and realized that when I pass the URL to Scrapy Shell the response I get is a redirected page that says (in addition to more) &quot;our cyber-security service, which provides protection for our customers and systems, has identified a problem that prevents us from completing your request.&quot; There is a link for &quot;Possible Causes and Remedies,&quot; of which there are three: (1) blacklisted IP, (2) anonymous or hidden proxy server, and (3) unsupported web browser. I am assuming it is #2 that is causing the problem, but don't really know, thus I am here.</p> <p>The site I am attempting to scrape is: <a href="https://secure.sos.state.or.us/oard/displayDivisionRules.action?select

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello everyone, i am working on a research project that involves automatically scraping GitHub’s public repositories to retrieve the Readme files and tags. </p> <p>I am using a standard token, that allows for 5000 API requests each hour. </p> <p>The script works fine, until i start receiving 401 error messages all of a sudden: the credentials i am using during the whole process are always the same, and i am checking to make sure i never hit the API limit (so that i don’t get any 403 error codes). </p> <p>I am not sure what is causing this: i am not using concurrent processes, as to not overload the API, and i am not hitting the rate limit. The token i am using is not being invalidated by GitHub, but still i am getting kicked out. </p> <p>I am using python, using libraries such as beautifulsoup4 and request to make the calls.</p> <p>Do you have any idea why this might happen?</p> <p>Thank you for your attention!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted

I'm pretty sure it's not a requirement... (unless it is, please let me know), I'm just mindful of the potential of people thinking it's a bit of a shady thing to and could come back at me. I often see Instagram comments of people upset artists aren't getting credited in posts.</p> <p>On the other hand, I'd rather not actively link people out of the mobile app if I can help it.</p> <p>PS, in the the future I intended to monetise the app with additional features, but all recipes will be viewable by all users, regarding if they're paid users.</p> <p>TIA!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Stock-Low-5593"> /u/Stock-Low-5593 </a>
