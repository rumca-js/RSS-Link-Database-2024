One is running Jellyfin bare metal proxied through nginx and the second is running nextcloud bare metal proxied through apache2 but since server one is already using port 443 I have to access nextcloud by going to nextcloud.mydomain.com:8080</p> <p>I watched a video about nginx proxy manager and I'm not sure if I understood right hence why I'm here but it said that you should install npm thought docker but then you have to run nextcloud through docker as well and I'm assuming Jellyfin would be the same. Here's the thing I want to keep both Jellyfin and nextcloud bare metal since it's the only way I've had the most success. It's it possible? </p> <p>Thanks in advance. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/iamwhoiwasnow"> /u/iamwhoiwasnow </a> <br /> <span><a
