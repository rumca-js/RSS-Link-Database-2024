Adhering to MISRA-C++ can help to achieve better internal quality, reducing the risk of undefined behavior and portability issues through implementation-defined behavior.\n\nSince the original MISRA-C++:2008 guidelines that addressed C++03, five new C++ standards were released. While inherently conservative, an update to the MISRA-C++ guidelines was prepared and is released in 2023 addressing C++17.\n\nThis talk will give an overview of why and what MISRA-C++:2023 attempts t", "id": 902913, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCZ1Rn-4AQE", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCJhay24LTpO1s4bIZxuIqKw", "source_obj__id": 421, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/oCZ1Rn-4AQE/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Safer C++ with MISRA-C++-2023 - Peter Sommerlad - ACCU 2024", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
