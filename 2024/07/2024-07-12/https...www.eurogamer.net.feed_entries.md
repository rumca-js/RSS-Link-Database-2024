Following its half-hearted, widely derided <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/just-dance-gran-turismo-feature-in-the-olympics-latest-stab-at-esports">stab at an esports event in 2023</a>, the International Olympic Committee has <a href="https://olympics.com/ioc/news/ioc-announces-olympic-esports-games-to-be-hosted-in-the-kingdom-of-saudi-arabia">announced</a> the inaugural Olympic Esports Games in partnership with the Saudi Arabian Olympic &amp; Paralympic Committee, to be held in Saudi Arabia next year.
</p><p>
Tethering its future esports success to a regime that's been widely criticised for its poor human rights record - which includes the criminalisation of homosexuality, fewer rights for women, and the use of the death penalty - is certainly a bold opening move for the IOC, but not unexpected given the Saudi government's heavy fin

## The 80s Karate Kid movies are getting a 16-bit-style beat-'em-up in September

80s movie favourite The Karate Kid is being turned into a 16-bit style side-scrolling beat-'em-up, and it's heading to PlayStation, Xbox, Switch and PC on 20th September this year.
</p><p>
The Karate Kid: Street Rumble comes from GameMill Entertainment, the publisher behind Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl, and is firmly setting its sights on the 80s era of Karate Kid rather than Netflix's Cobra Kai continuation - which has already spawned two games itself.
</p><p>
Street Rumble is, somewhat surprisingly, only the second game to be directly based on the 80s movie series (the first, Atlus' NES action game The Karate Kid, arrived in 1987) and promises to feature a whole bunch of familiar faces as its 80s-set mulitplayer action unfolds.

## Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed shows off its platform-brawling in first trailer

As an old person who's still not over the novelty of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles being allowed to be called the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in the UK without anyone getting funny about the word "ninja", it'd be fair to say I'm a little behind on the franchise. So the news there's a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game out this October based on a movie I didn't know existed using an art style I'm totally unfamiliar with has brought a whole succession of revelations.
</p><p>
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed, as the game is known, was actually announced earlier this year, but developer A Heartful of Games and publisher Outright Games have now released a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTQ-DC3dOpk">first trailer</a>, which you can see below. Mutants Unleashed - a "story-driven 3D brawler/platformer" - is c

## AMD's FSR 3.1 upscaling tested: improved over FSR 2 but DLSS and XeSS are still ahead

We've tested it to discover what improvements it offers over the initial offering and how FSR 3.1 compares to other image reconstruction techniques from Intel and Nvidia. Has the gulf in quality between machine learning-based solutions and the compute-driven FSR closed up? Is AMD now competitive?</p><p>The two promised major improvements to FSR 3.1 are straightforward to explain: the spatial temporal upscaler now produces higher-quality results, while the frame generation aspect is now decoupled from upscaling, allowing FSR 3 frame generation to be used with any image quality treatment (eg DLSS, XeSS or no AA at all). The latter is a great move,

## External translators hired for Nintendo projects bemoan lack of credit in "almost every big title"

Three Starfy games previously only available in Japan have been added to Nintendo Switch Online for Expansion members.
</p><p>
Densetsu no Starfy 1, 2 and 3 were all released on the Game Boy Advance between 2002 and 2004, but are now available globally on Switch. A fourth game came to Nintendo DS in 2006, which was followed by The Legendary Starfy on the same console - the only game in the series to be released outside of Japan, until now.
</p><p>
So who is Starfy? As one comment on X put it: "He's like Kirby, but a starfish". Makes sense.
