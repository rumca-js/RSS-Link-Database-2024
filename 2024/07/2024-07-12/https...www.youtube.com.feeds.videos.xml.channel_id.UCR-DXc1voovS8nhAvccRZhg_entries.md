Raspberry Pi 5 gets 10-15% speedup with 100 line Linux kernel patch. And what if we could save 50 megawatts of power annually, just with a software patch for older Pis?

I'll walk through the NUMA Emulation patch that supposedly boots Pi 5 performance, as well as some other new performance-related developments coming down the pike!
