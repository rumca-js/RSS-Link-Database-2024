<p>Three US Senators introduced a bill that aims to rein in the rise and use of AI generated content and deepfakes by protecting the work of artists, songwriters and journalists.</p>

<p>The controllers available for consoles like the Xbox Series X and the Nintendo Switch and even some for PC gaming are the peak result of an evolutionary ergonomic transformation. The days of boxy controllers like the NES GamePad and even the Atari 2600 joystick are almost gone from modern gaming but 8BitDo has done a great job of preserving those classic designs without totally sacrificing their functionality.</p> 
<p>8BitDo has been making these modern throwback peripherals for 11 years and it’s marking this anniversary with a pair of limited edition <a href="https://www.8bitdo.com/sn30-pro-usb-limited/">gold and silver SN30 Pro controllers</a>.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>There’s another chatbot in town. Amazon’s AI chatbot Rufus <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/how-to-use-amazon-rufus">is now live for all US customers</a>, albeit in a beta version. This follows a testing phase <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-launches-rufus-an-ai-powered-shopping-assistant-204811837.html">that began back in February</a>. Rufus looks to currently be tied to the app and not the web version of Amazon.</p>
<p>So what does it do? It’s an Amazon chatbot so it helps with shopping. You can ask for lists of recommended products and ask what specific products do and stuff like that.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>I’ve tooled around with it a bit this morning and it seems fine, though a bit boring. I will say that I cross-referenced some of the recommended products with the web version and Rufus does not automatically list promoted items, at least for now.</p>

<p>Analogue just announced a <a href="https://www.analogue.co/editions/pocket-aluminum">forthcoming limited edition</a> of its popular retro Pocket console. This one boasts an exterior made entirely out of attractive machined aluminum. It looks pretty dang cool. It also costs $500, which is almost $300 more than the non-aluminum Analogue Pocket.</p>
<p>Analogue promises that “every single piece” is “entirely CNC’d from aluminum.” The company also says it will be available in “highly limited quantities'' with orders going live on July 15 at 11AM ET. Past as prologue, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/analogues-limited-edition-pockets-are-delightful-and-frustrating-140012471.html">these limited editions sell out quickly</a>. If you want one, make sure to set a reminder or an alarm to join the queue, as Analogue says these consoles will never be sold again. They will be available in four anodized colors, including natural metal, indigo and black.</p>

The company had over 110 million wireless subscribers in 2022 so, yeah, this is kind of a big deal.</p>
<p>The data breach allowed hackers to steal phone numbers, text data and phone records from these people which, once again, comprises nearly the entire customer base, myself included. AT&amp;T says it will begin notifying consumers about the breach in the near future, committing to informing the 110 impacted million customers. The breach occurred during a six-month period from May 1, 2022 to October 31, 2022, though it looks like some data kept getting stolen up until January 2, 2023. This latter breach impacts a smaller, though unspecified, number of consumers.</p>

<p>I first started hitting arcades in the late '80s, and one of the first games I remember playing was the seminal 1987 beat-em-up <em>Double Dragon</em>. Probably not the most appropriate thing for a seven-year-old, but I pumped plenty of quarters into it and subsequently spent tons of time playing the NES port. After its late '80s / early '90s heyday, though, the Double Dragon series has gone through a number of weird iterations and revamps, and a new one based on the original game is set to arrive in 2025.</p>
<p><em>Double Dragon Revive</em> is produced by Japanese developer / publisher Arc System Works, who acquired the rights to Double Dragon back in 2015 after the original developer Technōs went out of business.

<p>The European Union has published the full and final text for the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/eu-regulators-pass-the-planets-first-sweeping-ai-regulations-190654561.html">EU AI Act</a> in its <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20240308IPR19015/artificial-intelligence-act-meps-adopt-landmark-law">Official Journal</a>, as reported by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/12/eus-ai-act-gets-published-in-blocs-official-journal-starting-clock-on-legal-deadlines/"><em>TechCrunch</em></a>. Since the new law will come into force 20 days after its publication, that means it will be enforceable starting on August 1. All its provisions will be fully applicable in two years' time, but some of them will be implemented much earlier than that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Six months from now, the bloc will start implementing bans on prohibited applications for AI, such as the use of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-27-eu-ai-report.html">social credit ranking systems</a>, t

<p><a href="https://lukemuscat.com/">Luke Muscat</a>, the lead designer for Halfbrick Studios' <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-06-09-get-the-real-fruit-ninja-on-the-vr-platform-of-your-choice.html"><em>Fruit Ninja</em></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jetpack-joyride-2-release-date-apple-arcade-161233299.html"><em>Jetpack Joyride</em></a>, has announced a new game called <em>Feed the Deep</em>. This time, he's not backed by a studio and supported by colleagues: <em>Feed the Deep</em> is his first solo project after quitting his job. He calls the game a &quot;Lovecraftian deep sea roguelike,&quot; because you take on the role of a diver who literally has to feed the eldritch horror lurking in the darkness of the ocean's depths.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the game, humanity built floating cities on the surface of the ocean without knowing about the threat living below. Your job is to feed whatever's living in the deep so that it doesn't destroy the cities. In its <a href="https://s

<p>Despite college being (potentially) some of the best years of your life, it can be hard to enjoy it if you're scrounging every dollar for books, supplies, food and, if you're lucky, the occasional outing with friends. But there is a silver lining: student discounts. While it seems like good discounts can be harder and harder to find for the rest of us, students can find them fairly easily if they know where to look. We’ve collected the best student discounts we could find on useful services, along with some things you’ll enjoy in your down time. Just keep in mind that most of these offers require you to prove your status as a student either by signing up with your .edu email address or providing a valid student ID.</p>

## Tesla brings the Model 3 Long Range RWD to the US for $42,490

<p>Tesla has introduced a <a href="https://www.tesla.com/model3/design#overview">Model 3 option</a> with 363 miles of range that will cost less than $35,000 after federal tax credits. The Model 3 Long Range Rear-Wheel-Drive is now on Tesla's configurator with deliveries slated between July and August 2024.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Performance-wise, it fits between the base model and Long Range AWD option, with a 125 MPH top speed and 0-60 time of 4.9 seconds. The AWD option is a $5,000 upgrade, though, so you're paying a lot for an extra 0.7 seconds of acceleration. For comparison, Hyundai's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hyundai-ioniq-6-first-drive-040124193.html">Ioniq 6 LR</a> has roughly the same range and price, but isn't eligible for the federal EV tax credit.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Model 3 Long Range RWD is now Tesla's cheapest EV, if you take the tax credit into account. That's because the base $38,990 Model 3 RWD version uses lithium-iron phosphate (LFP

<p>Joby Aviation says its electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft successfully completed a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/joby-aviation-says-it-completed-a-523-mile-test-flight-of-a-hydrogen-powered-air-taxi-154111466.html">523-mile test flight, powered by hydrogen</a>.</p>
<p>The only byproduct from the prototype, which has a liquid hydrogen fuel cell and hydrogen-electric propulsion system, was water vapor. The company suggested the test flight points to a future of emissions-free regional aviation in an industry that still relies heavily on fossil fuels. But it would say that.</p>
<p>This is apparently the first liquid hydrogen-powered eVTOL flight. Joby Aviation repurposed its existing battery-powered air taxi, installing a fuel tank that can store up to 40 kilograms of liquid hydrogen to reduce the battery load for the craft.</p>
